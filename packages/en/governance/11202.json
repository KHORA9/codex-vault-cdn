RICHARDSON\r\n\r\nA REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE STATE OF TENNESSEE\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME III\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED BY AUTHORITY OF CONGRESS 1902\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright 1897\r\n\r\nBY JAMES D. RICHARDSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrefatory Note\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second volume of this compilation, issued a few weeks since, was\r\nreceived with the same degree of favor as the first volume. It was a\r\nmatter of surprise that only sixteen years of our history, or eight\r\nCongresses, could be comprised within the second volume, while the first\r\ncovered twenty-eight years, or fourteen Congresses. There is greater\r\nsurprise that this volume includes only the period covered by the four\r\nyears of the second term of Andrew Jackson and the four years of Martin\r\nVan Buren's term--eight years in all, or four Congresses. However, it\r\nwill be found almost, if not quite, as interesting as the preceding\r\nones. In it will be found the conclusion of the controversy over the\r\nUnited States Bank, including President Jackson's reasons for the\r\nremoval of the deposits from that bank; his Farewell Address, and other\r\nimportant papers, all of which are characteristic of the man. It was\r\nduring the second Administration of President Jackson that the act\r\nchanging the ratio between the gold and silver dollar was passed.\r\n\r\nThis volume contains President Van Buren's message recommending the\r\nindependent treasury or subtreasury, and the discussion of that subject,\r\nwhich terminated in what has been termed \"the divorce of the bank and\r\nstate in the fiscal affairs of the Federal Government,\" and which\r\nPresident Van Buren considered a second Declaration of Independence. The\r\ncontroversy with Great Britain in relation to the northeastern boundary\r\nof the United States is also included in Van Buren's Administration, and\r\nwill prove highly interesting.\r\n\r\nThe omission of indexes to Volumes I and II has been commented on. The\r\nanswer to such comments is, it was deemed best to omit the index to each\r\nvolume and publish a general and comprehensive index to the entire work,\r\nin a separate volume. This index will be ready for distribution soon\r\nafter the issuance of the last volume.\r\n\r\nJAMES D. RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 26,1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew Jackson\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1833, to March 4, 1837\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew Jackson\r\n\r\nSECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: The will of the American people, expressed through\r\ntheir unsolicited suffrages, calls me before you to pass through the\r\nsolemnities preparatory to taking upon myself the duties of President of\r\nthe United States for another term. For their approbation of my public\r\nconduct through a period which has not been without its difficulties,\r\nand for this renewed expression of their confidence in my good\r\nintentions, I am at a loss for terms adequate to the expression of my\r\ngratitude. It shall be displayed to the extent of my humble abilities in\r\ncontinued efforts so to administer the Government as to preserve their\r\nliberty and promote their happiness.\r\n\r\nSo many events have occurred within the last four years which have\r\nnecessarily called forth--sometimes under circumstances the most\r\ndelicate and painful--my views of the principles and policy which ought\r\nto be pursued by the General Government that I need on this occasion but\r\nallude to a few leading considerations connected with some of them.\r\n\r\nThe foreign policy adopted by our Government soon after the formation\r\nof our present Constitution, and very generally pursued by successive\r\nAdministrations, has been crowned with almost complete success, and has\r\nelevated our character among the nations of the earth. To do justice to\r\nall and to submit to wrong from none has been during my Administration\r\nits governing maxim, and so happy have been its results that we are not\r\nonly at peace with all the world, but have few causes of controversy,\r\nand those of minor importance, remaining unadjusted.\r\n\r\nIn the domestic policy of this Government there are two objects\r\nwhich especially deserve the attention of the people and their\r\nrepresentatives, and which have been and will continue to be the\r\nsubjects of my increasing solicitude. They are the preservation of\r\nthe rights of the several States and the integrity of the Union.\r\n\r\nThese great objects are necessarily connected, and can only be attained\r\nby an enlightened exercise of the powers of each within its appropriate\r\nsphere in conformity with the public will constitutionally expressed.\r\nTo this end it becomes the duty of all to yield a ready and patriotic\r\nsubmission to the laws constitutionally enacted, and thereby promote and\r\nstrengthen a proper confidence in those institutions of the several\r\nStates and of the United States which the people themselves have\r\nordained for their own government.\r\n\r\nMy experience in public concerns and the observation of a life\r\nsomewhat advanced confirm the opinions long since imbibed by me, that\r\nthe destruction of our State governments or the annihilation of their\r\ncontrol over the local concerns of the people would lead directly\r\nto revolution and anarchy, and finally to despotism and military\r\ndomination. In proportion, therefore, as the General Government\r\nencroaches upon the rights of the States, in the same proportion does\r\nit impair its own power and detract from its ability to fulfill the\r\npurposes of its creation. Solemnly impressed with these considerations,\r\nmy countrymen will ever find me ready to exercise my constitutional\r\npowers in arresting measures which may directly or indirectly encroach\r\nupon the rights of the States or tend to consolidate all political power\r\nin the General Government. But of equal, and, indeed, of incalculable,\r\nimportance is the union of these States, and the sacred duty of all\r\nto contribute to its preservation by a liberal support of the General\r\nGovernment in the exercise of its just powers. You have been wisely\r\nadmonished to \"accustom yourselves to think and speak of the Union as of\r\nthe palladium of your political safety and prosperity, watching for its\r\npreservation with jealous anxiety, discountenancing whatever may suggest\r\neven a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned, and indignantly\r\nfrowning upon the first dawning of any attempt to alienate any portion\r\nof our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now\r\nlink together the various parts.\" Without union our independence and\r\nliberty would never have been achieved; without union they never can\r\nbe maintained. Divided into twenty-four, or even a smaller number, of\r\nseparate communities, we shall see our internal trade burdened with\r\nnumberless restraints and exactions; communication between distant\r\npoints and sections obstructed or cut off; our sons made soldiers to\r\ndeluge with blood the fields they now till in peace; the mass of our\r\npeople borne down and impoverished by taxes to support armies and\r\nnavies, and military leaders at the head of their victorious legions\r\nbecoming our lawgivers and judges. The loss of liberty, of all good\r\ngovernment, of peace, plenty, and happiness, must inevitably follow a\r\ndissolution of the Union. In supporting it, therefore, we support all\r\nthat is dear to the freeman and the philanthropist.\r\n\r\nThe time at which I stand before you is full of interest. The eyes of\r\nall nations are fixed on our Republic. The event of the existing crisis\r\nwill be decisive in the opinion of mankind of the practicability of our\r\nfederal system of government. Great is the stake placed in our hands;\r\ngreat is the responsibility which must rest upon the people of the\r\nUnited States. Let us realize the importance of the attitude in which we\r\nstand before the world. Let us exercise forbearance and firmness. Let us\r\nextricate our country from the dangers which surround it and learn\r\nwisdom from the lessons they inculcate.\r\n\r\nDeeply impressed with the truth of these observations, and under the\r\nobligation of that solemn oath which I am about to take, I shall\r\ncontinue to exert all my faculties to maintain the just powers of the\r\nConstitution and to transmit unimpaired to posterity the blessings of\r\nour Federal Union. At the same time, it will be my aim to inculcate by\r\nmy official acts the necessity of exercising by the General Government\r\nthose powers only that are clearly delegated; to encourage simplicity\r\nand economy in the expenditures of the Government; to raise no more\r\nmoney from the people than may be requisite for these objects, and in\r\na manner that will best promote the interests of all classes of the\r\ncommunity and of all portions of the Union. Constantly bearing in mind\r\nthat in entering into society \"individuals must give up a share of\r\nliberty to preserve the rest,\" it will be my desire so to discharge my\r\nduties as to foster with our brethren in all parts of the country a\r\nspirit of liberal concession and compromise, and, by reconciling our\r\nfellow-citizens to those partial sacrifices which they must unavoidably\r\nmake for the preservation of a greater good, to recommend our invaluable\r\nGovernment and Union to the confidence and affections of the American\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is my most fervent prayer to that Almighty Being before whom\r\nI now stand, and who has kept us in His hands from the infancy of our\r\nRepublic to the present day, that He will so overrule all my intentions\r\nand actions and inspire the hearts of my fellow-citizens that we may be\r\npreserved from dangers of all kinds and continue forever a united and\r\nhappy people.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1833.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF THE PUBLIC DEPOSITS.\r\n\r\n[Read to the Cabinet September 18, 1833]\r\n\r\nHaving carefully and anxiously considered all the facts and arguments\r\nwhich have been submitted to him relative to a removal of the public\r\ndeposits from the Bank of the United States, the President deems it his\r\nduty to communicate in this manner to his Cabinet the final conclusions\r\nof his own mind and the reasons on which they are founded, in order to\r\nput them in durable form and to prevent misconceptions.\r\n\r\nThe President's convictions of the dangerous tendencies of the Bank of\r\nthe United States, since signally illustrated by its own acts, were so\r\noverpowering when he entered on the duties of Chief Magistrate that he\r\nfelt it his duty, notwithstanding the objections of the friends by whom\r\nhe was surrounded, to avail himself of the first occasion to call the\r\nattention of Congress and the people to the question of its recharter.\r\nThe opinions expressed in his annual message of December, 1829, were\r\nreiterated in those of December, 1830 and 1831, and in that of 1830\r\nhe threw out for consideration some suggestions in relation to a\r\nsubstitute. At the session of 1831-32 an act was passed by a majority\r\nof both Houses of Congress rechartering the present bank, upon which\r\nthe President felt it his duty to put his constitutional veto. In his\r\nmessage returning that act he repeated and enlarged upon the principles\r\nand views briefly asserted in his annual message, declaring the bank\r\nto be, in his opinion, both inexpedient and unconstitutional, and\r\nannouncing to his countrymen very unequivocally his firm determination\r\nnever to sanction by his approval the continuance of that institution\r\nor the establishment of any other upon similar principles.\r\n\r\nThere are strong reasons for believing that the motive of the bank in\r\nasking for a recharter at that session of Congress was to make it a\r\nleading question in the election of a President of the United States the\r\nensuing November, and all steps deemed necessary were taken to procure\r\nfrom the people a reversal of the President's decision.\r\n\r\nAlthough the charter was approaching its termination, and the bank was\r\naware that it was the intention of the Government to use the public\r\ndeposit as fast as it has accrued in the payment of the public debt,\r\nyet did it extend its loans from January, 1831, to May, 1832, from\r\n$42,402,304.24 to $70,428,070.72, being an increase of $28,025,766.48\r\nin sixteen months. It is confidently believed that the leading object of\r\nthis immense extension of its loans was to bring as large a portion of\r\nthe people as possible under its power and influence, and it has been\r\ndisclosed that some of the largest sums were granted on very unusual\r\nterms to the conductors of the public press. In some of these cases the\r\nmotive was made manifest by the nominal or insufficient security taken\r\nfor the loans, by the large amounts discounted, by the extraordinary\r\ntime allowed for payment, and especially by the subsequent conduct of\r\nthose receiving the accommodations.\r\n\r\nHaving taken these preliminary steps to obtain control over public\r\nopinion, the bank came into Congress and asked a new charter. The object\r\navowed by many of the advocates of the bank was _to put the President\r\nto the test_, that the country might know his final determination\r\nrelative to the bank prior to the ensuing election. Many documents and\r\narticles were printed and circulated at the expense of the bank to bring\r\nthe people to a favorable decision upon its pretensions. Those whom the\r\nbank appears to have made its debtors for the special occasion were\r\nwarned of the ruin which awaited them should the President be sustained,\r\nand attempts were made to alarm the whole people by painting the\r\ndepression in the price of property and produce and the general loss,\r\ninconvenience, and distress which it was represented would immediately\r\nfollow the reelection of the President in opposition to the bank.\r\n\r\nCan it now be said that the question of a recharter of the bank was not\r\ndecided at the election which ensued? Had the veto been equivocal, or\r\nhad it not covered the whole ground; if it had merely taken exceptions\r\nto the details of the bill or to the time of its passage; if it had not\r\nmet the whole ground of constitutionality and expediency, then there\r\nmight have been some plausibility for the allegation that the question\r\nwas not decided by the people. It was to compel the President to take\r\nhis stand that the question was brought forward at that particular\r\ntime. He met the challenge, willingly took the position into which his\r\nadversaries sought to force him, and frankly declared his unalterable\r\nopposition to the bank as being both unconstitutional and inexpedient.\r\nOn that ground the case was argued to the people; and now that the\r\npeople have sustained the President, notwithstanding the array of\r\ninfluence and power which was brought to bear upon him, it is too late,\r\nhe confidently thinks, to say that the question has not been decided.\r\nWhatever may be the opinions of others, the President considers his\r\nreelection as a decision of the people against the bank. In the\r\nconcluding paragraph of his veto message he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n  I have now done my duty to my country. If sustained by my\r\n  fellow-citizens, I shall be grateful and happy; if not, I shall find\r\n  in the motives which impel me ample grounds for contentment and peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was sustained by a just people, and he desires to evince his\r\ngratitude by carrying into effect their decision so far as it depends\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nOf all the substitutes for the present bank which have been suggested,\r\nnone seems to have united any considerable portion of the public in its\r\nfavor. Most of them are liable to the same constitutional objections for\r\nwhich the present bank has been condemned, and perhaps to all there are\r\nstrong objections on the score of expediency. In ridding the country of\r\nan irresponsible power which has attempted to control the Government,\r\ncare must be taken not to unite the same power with the executive\r\nbranch. To give a President the control over the currency and the power\r\nover individuals now possessed by the Bank of the United States, even\r\nwith the material difference that he is responsible to the people, would\r\nbe as objectionable and as dangerous as to leave it as it is. Neither\r\none nor the other is necessary, and therefore ought not to be resorted\r\nto.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the President considers it as conclusively settled that\r\nthe charter of the Bank of the United States will not be renewed, and\r\nhe has no reasonable ground to believe that any substitute will be\r\nestablished. Being bound to regulate his course by the laws as they\r\nexist, and not to anticipate the interference of the legislative power\r\nfor the purpose of framing new systems, it is proper for him seasonably\r\nto consider the means by which the services rendered by the Bank of the\r\nUnited States are to be performed after its charter shall expire.\r\n\r\nThe existing laws declare that--\r\n\r\n  The deposits of the money of the United States in places in which the\r\n  said bank and branches thereof may be established shall be made in said\r\n  bank or branches thereof unless the Secretary of the Treasury shall at\r\n  any time otherwise order and direct, in which case the Secretary of the\r\n  Treasury shall immediately lay before Congress, if in session, and, if\r\n  not, immediately after the commencement of the next session, the reasons\r\n  of such order or direction.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Secretary of the Treasury over the deposits is\r\n_unqualified_. The provision that he shall report his reasons to\r\nCongress is no limitation. Had it not been inserted he would have been\r\nresponsible to Congress had he made a removal for any other than good\r\nreasons, and his responsibility now ceases upon the rendition of\r\nsufficient ones to Congress. The only object of the provision is to make\r\nhis reasons accessible to Congress and enable that body the more readily\r\nto judge of their soundness and purity, and thereupon to make such\r\nfurther provision by law as the legislative power may think proper in\r\nrelation to the deposit of the public money. Those reasons may be very\r\ndiversified. It was asserted by the Secretary of the Treasury, without\r\ncontradiction, as early as 1817, that he had power \"to control the\r\nproceedings\" of the Bank of the United States at any moment \"by changing\r\nthe deposits to the State banks\" should it pursue an illiberal course\r\ntoward those institutions; that \"the Secretary of the Treasury will\r\nalways be disposed to support the credit of the State banks, and will\r\ninvariably direct transfers from the deposits of the public money in aid\r\nof their legitimate exertions to maintain their credit;\" and he asserted\r\na right to employ the State banks when the Bank of the United States\r\nshould refuse to receive on deposit the notes of such State banks as the\r\npublic interest required should be received in payment of the public\r\ndues. In several instances he did transfer the public deposits to State\r\nbanks in the immediate vicinity of branches, for reasons connected only\r\nwith the safety of those banks, the public convenience, and the\r\ninterests of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nIf it was lawful for Mr. Crawford, the Secretary of the Treasury at that\r\ntime, to act on these principles, it will be difficult to discover any\r\nsound reason against the application of similar principles in still\r\nstronger cases. And it is a matter of surprise that a power which in\r\nthe infancy of the bank was freely asserted as one of the ordinary and\r\nfamiliar duties of the Secretary of the Treasury should now be gravely\r\nquestioned, and attempts made to excite and alarm the public mind as if\r\nsome new and unheard-of power was about to be usurped by the executive\r\nbranch of the Government.\r\n\r\nIt is but a little more than two and a half years to the termination of\r\nthe charter of the present bank. It is considered as the decision of the\r\ncountry that it shall then cease to exist, and no man, the President\r\nbelieves, has reasonable ground for expectation that any other Bank of\r\nthe United States will be created by Congress.\r\n\r\nTo the Treasury Department is intrusted the safe-keeping and faithful\r\napplication of the public moneys. A plan of collection different from\r\nthe present must therefore be introduced and put in complete operation\r\nbefore the dissolution of the present bank. When shall it be commenced?\r\nShall no step be taken in this essential concern until the charter\r\nexpires and the Treasury finds itself without an agent, its accounts in\r\nconfusion, with no depository for its funds, and the whole business of\r\nthe Government deranged, or shall it be delayed until six months, or a\r\nyear, or two years before the expiration of the charter? It is obvious\r\nthat any new system which may be substituted in the place of the Bank\r\nof the United States could not be suddenly carried into effect on the\r\ntermination of its existence without serious inconvenience to the\r\nGovernment and the people. Its vast amount of notes are then to be\r\nredeemed and withdrawn-from circulation and its immense debt collected.\r\nThese operations must be gradual, otherwise much suffering and distress\r\nwill be brought upon the community.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be not a work of months only, but of years, and the\r\nPresident thinks it can not, with due attention to the interests of the\r\npeople, be longer postponed. It is safer to begin it too soon than to\r\ndelay it too long.\r\n\r\nIt is for the wisdom of Congress to decide upon the best substitute\r\nto be adopted in the place of the Bank of the United States, and the\r\nPresident would have felt himself relieved from a heavy and painful\r\nresponsibility if in the charter to the bank Congress had reserved to\r\nitself the power of directing at its pleasure the public money to be\r\nelsewhere deposited, and had not devolved that power exclusively on one\r\nof the Executive Departments. It is useless now to inquire why this high\r\nand important power was surrendered by those who are peculiarly and\r\nappropriately the guardians of the public money. Perhaps it was an\r\noversight. But as the President presumes that the charter to the bank is\r\nto be considered as a contract on the part of the Government, it is not\r\nnow in the power of Congress to disregard its stipulations; and by the\r\nterms of that contract the public money is to be deposited in the bank\r\nduring the continuance of its charter unless the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury shall otherwise direct. Unless, therefore, the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury first acts, Congress have no power over the subject, for they\r\ncan not add a new clause to the charter or strike one out of it without\r\nthe consent of the bank, and consequently the public money must remain\r\nin that institution to the last hour of its existence unless the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury shall remove it at an earlier day. The\r\nresponsibility is thus thrown upon the executive branch of the\r\nGovernment of deciding how long before the expiration of the charter the\r\npublic interest will require the deposits to be placed elsewhere; and\r\nalthough according to the frame and principle of our Government this\r\ndecision would seem more properly to belong to the legislative power,\r\nyet as the law has imposed it upon the executive department the duty\r\nought to be faithfully and firmly met, and the decision made and\r\nexecuted upon the best lights that can be obtained and the best judgment\r\nthat can be formed. It would ill become the executive branch of the\r\nGovernment to shrink from any duty which the law imposes on it, to fix\r\nupon others the responsibility which justly belongs to itself. And while\r\nthe President anxiously wishes to abstain from the exercise of doubtful\r\npowers and to avoid all interference with the rights and duties\r\nof others, he must yet with unshaken constancy discharge his own\r\nobligations, and can not allow himself to turn aside in order to avoid\r\nany responsibility which the high trust with which he has been honored\r\nrequires him to encounter; and it being the duty of one of the Executive\r\nDepartments to decide in the first instance, subject to the future\r\naction of the legislative power, whether the public deposits shall\r\nremain in the Bank of the United States until the end of its existence\r\nor be withdrawn some time before, the President has felt himself bound\r\nto examine the question carefully and deliberately in order to make up\r\nhis judgment on the subject, and in his opinion the near approach of\r\nthe termination of the charter and the public considerations heretofore\r\nmentioned are of themselves amply sufficient to justify the removal of\r\nthe deposits, without reference to the conduct of the bank or their\r\nsafety in its keeping.\r\n\r\nBut in the conduct of the bank may be found other reasons, very\r\nimperative in their character, and which require prompt action.\r\nDevelopments have been made from time to time of its faithlessness as\r\na public agent, its misapplication of public funds, its interference in\r\nelections, its efforts by the machinery of committees to deprive the\r\nGovernment directors of a full knowledge of its concerns, and, above\r\nall, its flagrant misconduct as recently and unexpectedly disclosed\r\nin placing all the funds of the bank, including the money of the\r\nGovernment, at the disposition of the president of the bank as means\r\nof operating upon public opinion and procuring a new charter, without\r\nrequiring him to render a voucher for their disbursement. A brief\r\nrecapitulation of the facts which justify these charges, and which have\r\ncome to the knowledge of the public and the President, will, he thinks,\r\nremove every reasonable doubt as to the course which it is now the duty\r\nof the President to pursue.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in sixteen months ending in May, 1832, the bank\r\nhad extended its loans more than $28,000,000, although it knew the\r\nGovernment intended to appropriate most of its large deposit during that\r\nyear in payment of the public debt. It was in May, 1832, that its loans\r\narrived at the maximum, and in the preceding March so sensible was the\r\nbank that it would not be able to pay over the public deposit when\r\nit would be required by the Government that it commenced a secret\r\nnegotiation, without the approbation or knowledge of the Government,\r\nwith the agents for about $2,700,000 of the 3 per cent stocks held in\r\nHolland, with a view of inducing them not to come forward for payment\r\nfor one or more years after notice should be given by the Treasury\r\nDepartment. This arrangement would have enabled the bank to keep and use\r\nduring time the public money set apart for the payment of these stocks.\r\nAfter this negotiation had commenced, the Secretary of the Treasury\r\ninformed the bank that it was his intention to pay off one-half of the\r\n3 percents on the 1st of the succeeding July, which amounted to about\r\n$6,500,000. The president of the bank, although the committee of\r\ninvestigation was then looking into its affairs at Philadelphia, came\r\nimmediately to Washington, and upon representing that the bank was\r\ndesirous of accommodating the importing merchants at New York (which it\r\nfailed to do) and undertaking to pay the interest itself, procured the\r\nconsent of the Secretary, after consultation with the President, to\r\npostpone the payment until the succeeding 1st of October.\r\n\r\nConscious that at the end of that quarter the bank would not be able\r\nto pay over the deposits, and that further indulgence was not to be\r\nexpected of the Government, an agent was dispatched to England secretly\r\nto negotiate with the holders of the public debt in Europe and induce\r\nthem by the offer of an equal or higher interest than that paid by the\r\nGovernment to hold back their claims for one year, during which the bank\r\nexpected thus to retain the use of $5,000,000 of the public money, which\r\nthe Government should set apart for the payment of that debt. The agent\r\nmade an arrangement on terms, in part, which were in direct violation\r\nof the charter of the bank, and when some incidents connected with this\r\nsecret negotiation accidentally came to the knowledge of the public and\r\nthe Government, then, and not before, so much of it as was palpably in\r\nviolation of the charter was disavowed. A modification of the rest was\r\nattempted with the view of getting the certificates without payment of\r\nthe money, and thus absolving the Government from its liability to the\r\nholders. In this scheme the bank was partially successful, but to this\r\nday the certificates of a portion of these stocks have not been paid and\r\nthe bank retains the use of the money.\r\n\r\nThis effort to thwart the Government in the payment of the public debt\r\nthat it might retain the public money to be used for their private\r\ninterests, palliated by pretenses notoriously unfounded and insincere,\r\nwould have justified the instant withdrawal of the public deposits.\r\nThe negotiation itself rendered doubtful the ability of the bank to meet\r\nthe demands of the Treasury, and the misrepresentations by which it was\r\nattempted to be justified proved that no reliance could be placed upon\r\nits allegations.\r\n\r\nIf the question of a removal of the deposits presented itself to the\r\nExecutive in the same attitude that it appeared before the House of\r\nRepresentatives at their last session, their resolution in relation to\r\nthe safety of the deposits would be entitled to more weight, although\r\nthe decision of the question of removal has been confided by law to\r\nanother department of the Government. But the question now occurs\r\nattended by other circumstances and new disclosures of the most serious\r\nimport. It is true that in the message of the President which produced\r\nthis inquiry and resolution on the part of the House of Representatives\r\nit was his object to obtain the aid of that body in making a thorough\r\nexamination into the conduct and condition of the bank and its branches\r\nin order to enable the executive department to decide whether the public\r\nmoney was longer safe in its hands. The limited power of the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury over the subject disabled him from making the\r\ninvestigation as fully and satisfactorily as it could be done by a\r\ncommittee of the House of Representatives, and hence the President\r\ndesired the assistance of Congress to obtain for the Treasury Department\r\na full knowledge of all the facts which were necessary to guide his\r\njudgment. But it was not his purpose, as the language of his message\r\nwill show, to ask the representatives of the people to assume a\r\nresponsibility which did not belong to them and relieve the executive\r\nbranch of the Government from the duty which the law had imposed upon\r\nit. It is due to the President that his object in that proceeding should\r\nbe distinctly understood, and that he should acquit himself of all\r\nsuspicion of seeking to escape from the performance of his own duties or\r\nof desiring to interpose another body between himself and the people in\r\norder to avoid a measure which he is called upon to meet. But although\r\nas an act of justice to himself he disclaims any design of soliciting\r\nthe opinion of the House of Representatives in relation to his own\r\nduties in order to shelter himself from responsibility under the\r\nsanction of their counsel, yet he is at all times ready to listen to\r\nthe suggestions of the representatives of the people, whether given\r\nvoluntarily or upon solicitation, and to consider them with the profound\r\nrespect to which all will admit that they are justly entitled. Whatever\r\nmay be the consequences, however, to himself, he must finally form his\r\nown judgment where the Constitution and the law make it his duty to\r\ndecide, and must act accordingly; and he is bound to suppose that such\r\na course on his part will never be regarded by that elevated body as a\r\nmark of disrespect to itself, but that they will, on the contrary,\r\nesteem it the strongest evidence he can give of his fixed resolution\r\nconscientiously to discharge his duty to them and the country.\r\n\r\nA new state of things has, however, arisen since the close of the\r\nlast session of Congress, and evidence has since been laid before\r\nthe President which he is persuaded would have led the House of\r\nRepresentatives to a different conclusion if it had come to their\r\nknowledge. The fact that the bank controls, and in some cases\r\nsubstantially _owns_, and by its money _supports_ some of the leading\r\npresses of the country is now more clearly established. Editors to\r\nwhom it loaned extravagant sums in 1831 and 1832, on unusual time and\r\nnominal security, have since turned out to be insolvent, and to others\r\napparently in no better condition accommodations still more extravagant,\r\non terms more unusual, and some without any security, have also been\r\nheedlessly granted.\r\n\r\nThe allegation which has so often circulated through these channels that\r\nthe Treasury was bankrupt and the bank was sustaining it, when for many\r\nyears there has not been less, on an average, than six millions of\r\npublic money in that institution, might be passed over as a harmless\r\nmisrepresentation; but when it is attempted by substantial acts to\r\nimpair the credit of the Government and tarnish the honor of the\r\ncountry, such charges require more serious attention. With six millions\r\nof public money in its vaults, after having had the use of from five to\r\ntwelve millions for nine years without interest, it became the purchaser\r\nof a bill drawn by our Government on that of France for about $900,000,\r\nbeing the first installment of the French indemnity. The purchase money\r\nwas left in the use of the bank, being simply added to the Treasury\r\ndeposit. The bank sold the bill in England, and the holder sent it to\r\nFrance for collection, and arrangements not having been made by the\r\nFrench Government for its payment, it was taken up by the agents of the\r\nbank in Paris with the funds of the bank in their hands. Under these\r\ncircumstances it has through its organs openly assailed the credit of\r\nthe Government, and has actually made and persists in a demand of 15 per\r\ncent, or $158,842.77, as damages, when no damage, or none beyond some\r\ntrifling expense, has in fact been sustained, and when the bank had\r\nin its own possession on deposit several millions of the public money\r\nwhich it was then using for its own profit. Is a fiscal agent of the\r\nGovernment which thus seeks to enrich itself at the expense of the\r\npublic worthy of further trust?\r\n\r\nThere are other important facts not in the contemplation of the House\r\nof Representatives or not known to the members at the time they voted\r\nfor the resolution.\r\n\r\nAlthough the charter and the rules of the bank both declare that \"not\r\nless than seven directors\" shall be necessary to the transaction of\r\nbusiness, yet the most important business, even that of granting\r\ndiscounts to any extent, is intrusted to a committee of five members,\r\nwho do not report to the board.\r\n\r\nTo cut off all means of communication with the Government in relation\r\nto its most important acts at the commencement of the present year, not\r\none of the Government directors was placed on any one committee; and\r\nalthough since, by an unusual remodeling of those bodies, some of those\r\ndirectors have been placed on some of the committees, they are yet\r\nentirely excluded from the committee of exchange, through which the\r\ngreatest and most objectionable loans have been made.\r\n\r\nWhen the Government directors made an effort to bring back the business\r\nof the bank to the board in obedience to the charter and the existing\r\nregulations, the board not only overruled their attempt, but altered the\r\nrule so as to make it conform to the practice, in direct violation of\r\none of the most important provisions of the charter which gave them\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that the president of the bank, by his single\r\nwill, originates and executes many of the most important measures\r\nconnected with the management and credit of the bank, and that the\r\ncommittee as well as the board of directors are left in entire ignorance\r\nof many acts done and correspondence carried on in their names, and\r\napparently under their authority. The fact has been recently disclosed\r\nthat an unlimited discretion has been and is now vested in the president\r\nof the bank to expend its funds in payment for preparing and circulating\r\narticles and purchasing pamphlets and newspapers, calculated by their\r\ncontents to operate on elections and secure a renewal of its charter.\r\nIt appears from the official report of the public directors that on the\r\n30th November, 1830, the president submitted to the board an article\r\npublished in the American Quarterly Review containing favorable notices\r\nof the bank, and suggested the expediency of giving it a wider\r\ncirculation at the expense of the bank; whereupon the board passed the\r\nfollowing resolution, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the president be authorized to take such measures in\r\n  regard to the circulation of the contents of the said article, either\r\n  in whole or in part, as he may deem most for the interest of the bank.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy an entry in the minutes of the bank dated March 11, 1831, it appears\r\nthat the president had not only caused a large edition of that article\r\nto be issued, but had also, before the resolution of 30th November was\r\nadopted, procured to be printed and widely circulated numerous copies of\r\nthe reports of General Smith and Mr. McDuffie in favor of the bank; and\r\non that day he suggested the expediency of extending his power to the\r\nprinting of other articles which might subserve the purposes of the\r\ninstitution, whereupon the following resolution was adopted, viz--\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the president is hereby authorized to cause to be\r\n  prepared and circulated such documents and papers as may communicate\r\n  to the people information in regard to the nature and operations of\r\n  the bank.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expenditures purporting to have been made under authority of these\r\nresolutions during the years 1831 and 1832 were about $80,000. For a\r\nportion of these expenditures vouchers were rendered, from which it\r\nappears that they were incurred in the purchase of some hundred thousand\r\ncopies of newspapers, reports and speeches made in Congress, reviews\r\nof the veto message and reviews of speeches against the bank, etc.\r\nFor another large portion no vouchers whatever were rendered, but the\r\nvarious sums were paid on orders of the president of the bank, making\r\nreference to the resolution of the 11th of March, 1831.\r\n\r\nOn ascertaining these facts and perceiving that expenditures of a\r\nsimilar character were still continued, the Government directors a few\r\nweeks ago offered a resolution in the board calling for a specific\r\naccount of these expenditures, showing the objects to which they had\r\nbeen applied and the persons to whom the money had been paid. This\r\nreasonable proposition was voted down.\r\n\r\nThey also offered a resolution rescinding the resolutions of November,\r\n1830, and March, 1831. This also was rejected.\r\n\r\nNot content with thus refusing to recall the obnoxious power or even to\r\nrequire such an account of the expenditure as would show whether the\r\nmoney of the bank had in fact been applied to the objects contemplated\r\nby these resolutions, as obnoxious as they were, the board renewed the\r\npower already conferred, and even enjoined renewed attention to its\r\nexercise by adopting the following in lieu of the propositions submitted\r\nby the Government directors, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the board have confidence in the wisdom and integrity\r\n  of the president and in the propriety of the resolutions of 30th\r\n  November, 1830, and 11th March, 1831, and entertain a full conviction\r\n  of the necessity of a renewed attention to the object of those\r\n  resolutions, and that the president be authorized and requested to\r\n  continue his exertions for the promotion of said object.\r\n\r\n\r\nTaken in connection with the nature of the expenditures heretofore made,\r\nas recently disclosed, which the board not only tolerate, but approve,\r\nthis resolution puts the funds of the bank at the disposition of the\r\npresident for the purpose of employing the whole press of the country in\r\nthe service of the bank, to hire writers and newspapers, and to pay out\r\nsuch sums as he pleases to what person and for what services he pleases\r\nwithout the responsibility of rendering any specific account. The bank\r\nis thus converted into a vast electioneering engine, with means to\r\nembroil the country in deadly feuds, and, under cover of expenditures in\r\nthemselves improper, extend its corruption through all the ramifications\r\nof society.\r\n\r\nSome of the items for which accounts have been rendered show the\r\nconstruction which has been given to the resolutions and the way in\r\nwhich the power it confers has been exerted. The money has not been\r\nexpended merely in the publication and distribution of speeches, reports\r\nof committees, or articles written for the purpose of showing the\r\nconstitutionality or usefulness of the bank, but publications have been\r\nprepared and extensively circulated containing the grossest invectives\r\nagainst the officers of the Government, and the money which belongs to\r\nthe stockholders and to the public has been freely applied in efforts to\r\ndegrade in public estimation those who were supposed to be instrumental\r\nin resisting the wishes of this grasping and dangerous institution. As\r\nthe president of the bank has not been required to settle his accounts,\r\nno one but himself knows how much more than the sum already mentioned\r\nmay have been squandered, and for which a credit may hereafter be\r\nclaimed in his account under this most extraordinary resolution. With\r\nthese facts before us can we be surprised at the torrent of abuse\r\nincessantly poured out against all who are supposed to stand in the way\r\nof the cupidity or ambition of the Bank of the United States? Can we be\r\nsurprised at sudden and unexpected changes of opinion in favor of an\r\ninstitution which has millions to lavish and avows its determination not\r\nto spare its means when they are necessary to accomplish its purposes?\r\nThe refusal to render an account of the manner in which a part of the\r\nmoney expended has been applied gives just cause for the suspicion that\r\nit has been used for purposes which it is not deemed prudent to expose\r\nto the eyes of an intelligent and virtuous people. Those who act justly\r\ndo not shun the light, nor do they refuse explanations when the\r\npropriety of their conduct is brought into question.\r\n\r\nWith these facts before him in an official report from the Government\r\ndirectors, the President would feel that he was not only responsible for\r\nall the abuses and corruptions the bank has committed or may commit, but\r\nalmost an accomplice in a conspiracy against that Government which he\r\nhas sworn honestly to administer, if he did not take every step within\r\nhis constitutional and legal power likely to be efficient in putting an\r\nend to these enormities. If it be possible within the scope of human\r\naffairs to find a reason for removing the Government deposits and\r\nleaving the bank to its own resource for the means of effecting its\r\ncriminal designs, we have it here. Was it expected when the moneys of\r\nthe United States were directed to be placed in that bank that they\r\nwould be put under the control of one man empowered to spend millions\r\nwithout rendering a voucher or specifying the object? Can they be\r\nconsidered safe with the evidence before us that tens of thousands have\r\nbeen spent for highly improper, if not corrupt, purposes, and that the\r\nsame motive may lead to the expenditure of hundreds of thousands, and\r\neven millions, more? And can we justify ourselves to the people by\r\nlonger lending to it the money and power of the Government to be\r\nemployed for such purposes?\r\n\r\nIt has been alleged by some as an objection to the removal of the\r\ndeposits that the bank has the power, and in that event will have the\r\ndisposition, to destroy the State banks employed by the Government,\r\nand bring distress upon the country. It has been the fortune of the\r\nPresident to encounter dangers which were represented as equally\r\nalarming, and he has seen them vanish before resolution and energy.\r\nPictures equally appalling were paraded before him when this bank came\r\nto demand a new charter. But what was the result? Has the country been\r\nruined, or even distressed? Was it ever more prosperous than since that\r\nact? The President verily believes the bank has not the power to produce\r\nthe calamities its friends threaten. The funds of the Government will\r\nnot be annihilated by being transferred. They will immediately be issued\r\nfor the benefit of trade, and if the Bank of the United States curtails\r\nits loans the State banks, strengthened by the public deposits, will\r\nextend theirs. What comes in through one bank will go out through\r\nothers, and the equilibrium will be preserved. Should the bank, for the\r\nmere purpose of producing distress, press its debtors more heavily than\r\nsome of them can bear, the consequences will recoil upon itself, and in\r\nthe attempts to embarrass the country it will only bring loss and ruin\r\nupon the holders of its own stock. But if the President believed the\r\nbank possessed all the power which has been attributed to it, his\r\ndetermination would only be rendered the more inflexible. If, indeed,\r\nthis corporation now holds in its hands the happiness and prosperity of\r\nthe American people, it is high time to take the alarm. If the despotism\r\nbe already upon us and our only safety is in the mercy of the despot,\r\nrecent developments in relation to his designs and the means he employs\r\nshow how necessary it is to shake it off. The struggle can never come\r\nwith less distress to the people or under more favorable auspices than\r\nat the present moment.\r\n\r\nAll doubt as to the willingness of the State banks to undertake the\r\nservice of the Government to the same extent and on the same terms as it\r\nis now performed by the Bank of the United States is put to rest by the\r\nreport of the agent recently employed to collect information, and from\r\nthat willingness their own safety in the operation may be confidently\r\ninferred. Knowing their own resources better than they can be known by\r\nothers, it is not to be supposed that they would be willing to place\r\nthemselves in a situation which they can not occupy without danger of\r\nannihilation or embarrassment. The only consideration applies to the\r\nsafety of the public funds if deposited in those institutions, and when\r\nit is seen that the directors of many of them are not only willing\r\nto pledge the character and capital of the corporations in giving\r\nsuccess to this measure, but also their own property and reputation, we\r\ncan not doubt that they at least believe the public deposits would be\r\nsafe in their management. The President thinks that these facts and\r\ncircumstances afford as strong a guaranty as can be had in human\r\naffairs for the safety of the public funds and the practicability of\r\na new system of collection and disbursement through the agency of the\r\nState banks.\r\n\r\nFrom all these considerations the President thinks that the State banks\r\nought immediately to be employed in the collection and disbursement of\r\nthe public revenue, and the funds now in the Bank of the United States\r\ndrawn out with all convenient dispatch. The safety of the public moneys\r\nif deposited in the State banks must be secured beyond all reasonable\r\ndoubts; but the extent and nature of the security, in addition to their\r\ncapital, if any be deemed necessary, is a subject of detail to which the\r\nTreasury Department will undoubtedly give its anxious attention. The\r\nbanks to be employed must remit the moneys of the Government without\r\ncharge, as the Bank of the United States now does; must render all the\r\nservices which that bank now performs; must keep the Government advised\r\nof their situation by periodical returns; in fine, in any arrangement\r\nwith the State banks the Government must not in any respect be placed on\r\na worse footing than it now is. The President is happy to perceive by\r\nthe report of the agent that the banks which he has consulted have, in\r\ngeneral, consented to perform the service on these terms, and that those\r\nin New York have further agreed to make payments in London without other\r\ncharge than the mere cost of the bills of exchange.\r\n\r\nIt should also be enjoined upon any banks which may be employed that\r\nit will be expected of them to facilitate domestic exchanges for the\r\nbenefit of internal commerce; to grant all reasonable facilities to the\r\npayers of the revenue; to exercise the utmost liberality toward the\r\nother State banks, and do nothing uselessly to embarrass the Bank of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nAs one of the most serious objections to the Bank of the United States\r\nis the power which it concentrates, care must be taken in finding other\r\nagents for the service of the Treasury not to raise up another power\r\nequally formidable. Although it would probably be impossible to produce\r\nsuch a result by any organization of the State banks which could be\r\ndevised, yet it is desirable to avoid even the appearance. To this end\r\nit would be expedient to assume no more power over them and interfere no\r\nmore in their affairs than might be absolutely necessary to the security\r\nof the public deposit and the faithful performance of their duties\r\nas agents of the Treasury. Any interference by them in the political\r\ncontests of the country with a view to influence elections ought, in the\r\nopinion of the President, to be followed by an immediate discharge from\r\nthe public service.\r\n\r\nIt is the desire of the President that the control of the banks and\r\nthe currency shall, as far as possible, be entirely separated from the\r\npolitical power of the country as well as wrested from an institution\r\nwhich has already attempted to subject the Government to its will.\r\nIn his opinion the action of the General Government on this subject\r\nought not to extend beyond the grant in the Constitution, which only\r\nauthorizes Congress \"to coin money and regulate the value thereof;\"\r\nall else belongs to the States and the people, and must be regulated\r\nby public opinion and the interests of trade.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the President must be permitted to remark that he looks\r\nupon the pending question as of higher consideration than the mere\r\ntransfer of a sum of money from one bank to another. Its decision may\r\naffect the character of our Government for ages to come. Should the bank\r\nbe suffered longer to use the public moneys in the accomplishment of its\r\npurposes, with the proofs of its faithlessness and corruption before\r\nour eyes, the patriotic among our citizens will despair of success in\r\nstruggling against its power, and we shall be responsible for entailing\r\nit upon our country forever. Viewing it as a question of transcendent\r\nimportance, both in the principles and consequences it involves, the\r\nPresident could not, in justice to the responsibility which he owes to\r\nthe country, refrain from pressing upon the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nhis view of the considerations which impel to immediate action. Upon him\r\nhas been devolved by the Constitution and the suffrages of the American\r\npeople the duty of superintending the operation of the Executive\r\nDepartments of the Government and seeing that the laws are faithfully\r\nexecuted. In the performance of this high trust it is his undoubted\r\nright to express to those whom the laws and his own choice have made his\r\nassociates in the administration of the Government his opinion of their\r\nduties under circumstances as they arise. It is this right which he now\r\nexercises. Far be it from him to expect or require that any member of\r\nthe Cabinet should at his request, order, or dictation do any act which\r\nhe believes unlawful or in his conscience condemns. From them and from\r\nhis fellow-citizens in general he desires only that aid and support\r\nwhich their reason approves and their conscience sanctions.\r\n\r\nIn the remarks he has made on this all-important question he trusts\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury will see only the frank and respectful\r\ndeclarations of the opinions which the President has formed on a measure\r\nof great national interest deeply affecting the character and usefulness\r\nof his Administration, and not a spirit of dictation, which the\r\nPresident would be as careful to avoid as ready to resist. Happy will he\r\nbe if the facts now disclosed produce uniformity of opinion and unity of\r\naction among the members of the Administration.\r\n\r\nThe President again repeats that he begs his Cabinet to consider the\r\nproposed measure as his own, in the support of which he shall require\r\nno one of them to make a sacrifice of opinion or principle. Its\r\nresponsibility has been assumed after the most mature deliberation\r\nand reflection as necessary to preserve the morals of the people, the\r\nfreedom of the press, and the purity of the elective franchise, without\r\nwhich all will unite in saying that the blood and treasure expended by\r\nour forefathers in the establishment of our happy system of government\r\nwill have been vain and fruitless. Under these convictions he feels that\r\na measure so important to the American people can not be commenced too\r\nsoon, and he therefore names the 1st day of October next as a period\r\nproper for the change of the deposits, or sooner, provided the necessary\r\narrangements with the State banks can be made.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\nDecember 3, 1833.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nOn your assembling to perform the high trusts which the people of the\r\nUnited States have confided to you, of legislating for their common\r\nwelfare, it gives me pleasure to congratulate you upon the happy\r\ncondition of our beloved country. By the favor of Divine Providence\r\nhealth is again restored to us, peace reigns within our borders,\r\nabundance crowns the labors of our fields, commerce and domestic\r\nindustry flourish and increase, and individual happiness rewards the\r\nprivate virtue and enterprise of our citizens.\r\n\r\nOur condition abroad is no less honorable than it is prosperous at home.\r\nSeeking nothing that is not right and determined to submit to nothing\r\nthat is wrong, but desiring honest friendships and liberal intercourse\r\nwith all nations, the United States have gained throughout the world\r\nthe confidence and respect which are due to a policy so just and so\r\ncongenial to the character of the American people and to the spirit of\r\ntheir institutions.\r\n\r\nIn bringing to your notice the particular state of our foreign affairs,\r\nit affords me high gratification to inform you that they are in a\r\ncondition which promises the continuance of friendship with all nations.\r\n\r\nWith Great Britain the interesting question of our northeastern boundary\r\nremains still undecided. A negotiation, however, upon that subject has\r\nbeen renewed since the close of the last Congress, and a proposition has\r\nbeen submitted to the British Government with the view of establishing,\r\nin conformity with the resolution of the Senate, the line designated by\r\nthe treaty of 1783. Though no definitive answer has been received, it\r\nmay be daily looked for, and I entertain a hope that the overture may\r\nultimately lead to a satisfactory adjustment of this important matter.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform you that a negotiation which, by\r\ndesire of the House of Representatives, was opened some years ago with\r\nthe British Government, for the erection of light-houses on the Bahamas,\r\nhas been successful. Those works, when completed, together with those\r\nwhich the United States have constructed on the western side of the Gulf\r\nof Florida, will contribute essentially to the safety of navigation\r\nin that sea. This joint participation in establishments interesting\r\nto humanity and beneficial to commerce is worthy of two enlightened\r\nnations, and indicates feelings which can not fail to have a happy\r\ninfluence upon their political relations. It is gratifying to the\r\nfriends of both to perceive that the intercourse between the two people\r\nis becoming daily more extensive, and that sentiments of mutual good\r\nwill have grown up befitting their common origin and justifying the hope\r\nthat by wise counsels on each side not only unsettled questions may be\r\nsatisfactorily terminated, but new causes of misunderstanding prevented.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that I continue to receive the most amicable assurances\r\nfrom the Government of France, and that in all other respects the most\r\nfriendly relations exist between the United States and that Government,\r\nit is to be regretted that the stipulations of the convention concluded\r\non the 4th July, 1831, remain in some important parts unfulfilled.\r\n\r\nBy the second article of that convention it was stipulated that the sum\r\npayable to the United States should be paid at Paris, in six annual\r\ninstallments, into the hands of such person or persons as should be\r\nauthorized by the Government of the United States to receive it, and\r\nby the same article the first installment was payable on the 2d day of\r\nFebruary, 1833. By the act of Congress of the 13th July, 1832, it was\r\nmade the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to cause the several\r\ninstallments, with the interest thereon, to be received from the French\r\nGovernment and transferred to the United States in such manner as he may\r\ndeem best; and by the same act of Congress the stipulations on the part\r\nof the United States in the convention were in all respects fulfilled.\r\nNot doubting that a treaty thus made and ratified by the two\r\nGovernments, and faithfully executed by the United States, would be\r\npromptly complied with by the other party, and desiring to avoid the\r\nrisk and expense of intermediate agencies, the Secretary of the Treasury\r\ndeemed it advisable to receive and transfer the first installment by\r\nmeans of a draft upon the French minister of finance. A draft for this\r\npurpose was accordingly drawn in favor of the cashier of the Bank of the\r\nUnited States for the amount accruing to the United States out of the\r\nfirst installment, and the interest payable with it. This bill was not\r\ndrawn at Washington until five days after the installment was payable\r\nat Paris, and was accompanied by a special authority from the President\r\nauthorizing the cashier or his assigns to receive the amount. The mode\r\nthus adopted of receiving the installment was officially made known\r\nto the French Government by the American chargé d'affaires at Paris,\r\npursuant to instructions from the Department of State. The bill,\r\nhowever, though not presented for payment until the 23d day of March,\r\nwas not paid, and for the reason assigned by the French minister of\r\nfinance that no appropriation had been made by the French Chambers.\r\nIt is not known to me that up to that period any appropriation had been\r\nrequired of the Chambers, and although a communication was subsequently\r\nmade to the Chambers by direction of the King, recommending that the\r\nnecessary provision should be made for carrying the convention into\r\neffect, it was at an advanced period of the session, and the subject\r\nwas finally postponed until the next meeting of the Chambers.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding it has been supposed by the French ministry that the\r\nfinancial stipulations of the treaty can not be carried into effect\r\nwithout an appropriation by the Chambers, it appears to me to be not\r\nonly consistent with the character of France, but due to the character\r\nof both Governments, as well as to the rights of our citizens, to treat\r\nthe convention, made and ratified in proper form, as pledging the good\r\nfaith of the French Government for its execution, and as imposing upon\r\neach department an obligation to fulfill it; and I have received\r\nassurances through our chargé d'affaires at Paris and the French\r\nminister plenipotentiary at Washington, and more recently through the\r\nminister of the United States at Paris, that the delay has not proceeded\r\nfrom any indisposition on the part of the King and his ministers to\r\nfulfill the treaty, and that measures will be presented at the next\r\nmeeting of the Chambers, and with a reasonable hope of success, to\r\nobtain the necessary appropriation.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to state, however, that the documents, except certain\r\nlists of vessels captured, condemned, or burnt at sea, proper to\r\nfacilitate the examination and liquidation of the reclamations comprised\r\nin the stipulations of the convention, and which by the sixth article\r\nFrance engaged to communicate to the United States by the intermediary\r\nof the legation, though repeatedly applied for by the American chargé\r\nd'affaires under instructions from this Government, have not yet been\r\ncommunicated; and this delay, it is apprehended, will necessarily\r\nprevent the completion of the duties assigned to the commissioners\r\nwithin the time at present prescribed by law.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for delaying to communicate these documents have not been\r\nexplicitly stated, and this is the more to be regretted as it is not\r\nunderstood that the interposition of the Chambers is in any manner\r\nrequired for the delivery of those papers.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, in a case so important to the interests\r\nof our citizens and to the character of our country, and under\r\ndisappointments so unexpected, I deemed it my duty, however I might\r\nrespect the general assurances to which I have adverted, no longer to\r\ndelay the appointment of a minister plenipotentiary to Paris, but to\r\ndispatch him in season to communicate the result of his application to\r\nthe French Government at an early period of your session. I accordingly\r\nappointed a distinguished citizen for this purpose, who proceeded on his\r\nmission in August last and was presented to the King early in the month\r\nof October. He is particularly instructed as to all matters connected\r\nwith the present posture of affairs, and I indulge the hope that with\r\nthe representations he is instructed to make, and from the disposition\r\nmanifested by the King and his ministers in their recent assurances to\r\nour minister at Paris, the subject will be early considered, and\r\nsatisfactorily disposed of at the next meeting of the Chambers.\r\n\r\nAs this subject involves important interests and has attracted a\r\nconsiderable share of the public attention, I have deemed it proper\r\nto make this explicit statement of its actual condition, and should\r\nI be disappointed in the hope now entertained the subject will be\r\nagain brought to the notice of Congress in such manner as the occasion\r\nmay require.\r\n\r\nThe friendly relations which have always been maintained between the\r\nUnited States and Russia have been further extended and strengthened by\r\nthe treaty of navigation and commerce concluded on the 6th of December\r\nlast, and sanctioned by the Senate before the close of its last session.\r\nThe ratifications having been since exchanged, the liberal provisions\r\nof the treaty are now in full force, and under the encouragement which\r\nthey have secured a flourishing and increasing commerce, yielding its\r\nbenefits to the enterprise of both nations, affords to each the just\r\nrecompense of wise measures, and adds new motives for that mutual\r\nfriendship which the two countries have hitherto cherished toward\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nIt affords me peculiar satisfaction to state that the Government of\r\nSpain has at length yielded to the justice of the claims which have been\r\nso long urged in behalf of our citizens, and has expressed a willingness\r\nto provide an indemnification as soon as the proper amount can be agreed\r\nupon. Upon this latter point it is probable an understanding had taken\r\nplace between the minister of the United States and the Spanish\r\nGovernment before the decease of the late King of Spain; and, unless\r\nthat event may have delayed its completion, there is reason to hope that\r\nit may be in my power to announce to you early in your present session\r\nthe conclusion of a convention upon terms not less favorable than those\r\nentered into for similar objects with other nations. That act of justice\r\nwould well accord with the character of Spain, and is due to the United\r\nStates from their ancient friend. It could not fail to strengthen the\r\nsentiments of amity and good will between the two nations which it is so\r\nmuch the wish of the United States to cherish and so truly the interest\r\nof both to maintain.\r\n\r\nBy the first section of an act of Congress passed on the 13th of July,\r\n1832, the tonnage duty on Spanish ships arriving from the ports of Spain\r\nwas limited to the duty payable on American vessels in the ports of\r\nSpain previous to the 20th of October, 1817, being 5 cents per ton. That\r\nact was intended to give effect on our side to an arrangement made with\r\nthe Spanish Government by which discriminating duties of tonnage were to\r\nbe abolished in the ports of the United States and Spain on the vessels\r\nof the two nations. Pursuant to that arrangement, which was carried into\r\neffect on the part of Spain on the 20th of May, 1832, by a royal order\r\ndated the 20th of April, 1832, American vessels in the ports of Spain\r\nhave paid 5 cents per ton, which rate of duty is also paid in those\r\nports by Spanish ships; but as American vessels pay no tonnage duty\r\nin the ports of the United States, the duty of 5 cents payable in our\r\nports by Spanish vessels under the act above mentioned is really a\r\ndiscriminating duty, operating to the disadvantage of Spain. Though no\r\ncomplaint has yet been made on the part of Spain, we are not the less\r\nbound by the obligations of good faith to remove the discrimination,\r\nand I recommend that the act be amended accordingly. As the royal order\r\nabove alluded to includes the ports of the Balearic and Canary islands\r\nas well as those of Spain, it would seem that the provisions of the act\r\nof Congress should be equally extensive, and that for the repayment of\r\nsuch duties as may have been improperly received an addition should be\r\nmade to the sum appropriated at the last session of Congress for\r\nrefunding discriminating duties.\r\n\r\nAs the arrangement referred to, however, did not embrace the islands of\r\nCuba and Puerto Rico, discriminating duties to the prejudice of American\r\nshipping continue to be levied there. From the extent of the commerce\r\ncarried on between the United States and those islands, particularly the\r\nformer, this discrimination causes serious injury to one of those great\r\nnational interests which it has been considered an essential part of our\r\npolicy to cherish, and has given rise to complaints on the part of our\r\nmerchants. Under instructions given to our minister at Madrid, earnest\r\nrepresentations have been made by him to the Spanish Government upon\r\nthis subject, and there is reason to expect, from the friendly\r\ndisposition which is entertained toward this country, that a beneficial\r\nchange will be produced. The disadvantage, however, to which our\r\nshipping is subjected by the operation of these discriminating duties\r\nrequires that they be met by suitable countervailing duties during your\r\npresent session, power being at the same time vested in the President\r\nto modify or discontinue them as the discriminating duties on American\r\nvessels or their cargoes may be modified or discontinued at those\r\nislands. Intimations have been given to the Spanish Government that\r\nthe United States may be obliged to resort to such measures as are of\r\nnecessary self-defense, and there is no reason to apprehend that it\r\nwould be unfavorably received. The proposed proceeding if adopted\r\nwould not be permitted, however, in any degree to induce a relaxation\r\nin the efforts of our minister to effect a repeal of this irregularity\r\nby friendly negotiation, and it might serve to give force to his\r\nrepresentations by showing the dangers to which that valuable trade is\r\nexposed by the obstructions and burdens which a system of discriminating\r\nand countervailing duties necessarily produces.\r\n\r\nThe selection and preparation of the Florida archives for the purpose of\r\nbeing delivered over to the United States, in conformity with the royal\r\norder as mentioned in my last annual message, though in progress, has\r\nnot yet been completed. This delay has been produced partly by causes\r\nwhich were unavoidable, particularly the prevalence of the cholera at\r\nHavana; but measures have been taken which it is believed will expedite\r\nthe delivery of those important records.\r\n\r\nCongress were informed at the opening of the last session that\r\n\"owing, as was alleged, to embarrassments in the finances of Portugal,\r\nconsequent upon the civil war in which that nation was engaged,\" payment\r\nhad been made of only one installment of the amount which the Portuguese\r\nGovernment had stipulated to pay for indemnifying our citizens for\r\nproperty illegally captured in the blockade of Terceira. Since that\r\ntime a postponement for two years, with interest, of the two remaining\r\ninstallments was requested by the Portuguese Government, and as a\r\nconsideration it offered to stipulate that rice of the United States\r\nshould be admitted into Portugal at the same duties as Brazilian rice.\r\nBeing satisfied that no better arrangement could be made, my consent was\r\ngiven, and a royal order of the King of Portugal was accordingly issued\r\non the 4th of February last for the reduction of the duty on rice of the\r\nUnited States. It would give me great pleasure if in speaking of that\r\ncountry, in whose prosperity the United States are so much interested,\r\nand with whom a long-subsisting, extensive, and mutually advantageous\r\ncommercial intercourse has strengthened the relations of friendship,\r\nI could announce to you the restoration of its internal tranquillity.\r\n\r\nSubsequently to the commencement of the last session of Congress the\r\nfinal installment payable by Denmark under the convention of the 28th\r\nday of March, 1830, was received. The commissioners for examining the\r\nclaims have since terminated their labors, and their awards have been\r\npaid at the Treasury as they have been called for. The justice rendered\r\nto our citizens by that Government is thus completed, and a pledge\r\nis thereby afforded for the maintenance of that friendly intercourse\r\nbecoming the relations that the two nations mutually bear to each other.\r\n\r\nIt is satisfactory to inform you that the Danish Government have\r\nrecently issued an ordinance by which the commerce with the island of\r\nSt. Croix is placed on a more liberal footing than heretofore. This\r\nchange can not fail to prove beneficial to the trade between the United\r\nStates and that colony, and the advantages likely to flow from it may\r\nlead to greater relaxations in the colonial systems of other nations.\r\n\r\nThe ratifications of the convention with the King of the Two Sicilies\r\nhave been duly exchanged, and the commissioners appointed for examining\r\nthe claims under it have entered upon the duties assigned to them by\r\nlaw. The friendship that the interests of the two nations require of\r\nthem being now established, it may be hoped that each will enjoy the\r\nbenefits which a liberal commerce should yield to both.\r\n\r\nA treaty of amity and commerce between the United States and Belgium\r\nwas concluded during the last winter and received the sanction of the\r\nSenate, but the exchange of the ratifications has been hitherto delayed,\r\nin consequence, in the first instance, of some delay in the reception of\r\nthe treaty at Brussels, and, subsequently, of the absence of the Belgian\r\nminister of foreign affairs at the important conferences in which his\r\nGovernment is engaged at London. That treaty does but embody those\r\nenlarged principles of friendly policy which it is sincerely hoped will\r\nalways regulate the conduct of the two nations having such strong\r\nmotives to maintain amicable relations toward each other and so\r\nsincerely desirous to cherish them.\r\n\r\nWith all the other European powers with whom the United States have\r\nformed diplomatic relations and with the Sublime Porte the best\r\nunderstanding prevails. From all I continue to receive assurances of\r\ngood will toward the United States--assurances which it gives me no less\r\npleasure to reciprocate than to receive. With all, the engagements which\r\nhave been entered into are fulfilled with good faith on both sides.\r\nMeasures have also been taken to enlarge our friendly relations and\r\nextend our commercial intercourse with other States. The system we have\r\npursued of aiming at no exclusive advantages, of dealing with all on\r\nterms of fair and equal reciprocity, and of adhering scrupulously to all\r\nour engagements is well calculated to give success to efforts intended\r\nto be mutually beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe wars of which the southern part of this continent was so long the\r\ntheater, and which were carried on either by the mother country against\r\nthe States which had formerly been her colonies or by the States against\r\neach other, having terminated, and their civil dissensions having so\r\nfar subsided as with; few exceptions no longer to disturb the public\r\ntranquillity, it is earnestly hoped those States will be able to employ\r\nthemselves without interruption in perfecting their institutions,\r\ncultivating the arts of peace, and promoting by wise councils and able\r\nexertions the public and private prosperity which their patriotic\r\nstruggles so well entitle them to enjoy.\r\n\r\nWith those States our relations have undergone but little change during\r\nthe present year. No reunion having yet taken place between the States\r\nwhich composed the Republic of Colombia, our chargé d'affaires at Bogota\r\nhas been accredited to the Government of New Grenada, and we have,\r\ntherefore, no diplomatic relations with Venezuela and Equator, except\r\nas they may be included in those heretofore formed with the Colombian\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that representatives from the three States were\r\nabout to assemble at Bogota to confer on the subject of their mutual\r\ninterests, particularly that of their union, and if the result should\r\nrender it necessary, measures will be taken on our part to preserve with\r\neach that friendship and those liberal commercial connections which it\r\nhas been the constant desire of the United States to cultivate with\r\ntheir sister Republics of this hemisphere. Until the important question\r\nof reunion shall be settled, however, the different matters which have\r\nbeen under discussion between the United States and the Republic of\r\nColombia, or either of the States which composed it, are not likely\r\nto be brought to a satisfactory issue.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the illness of the chargé d'affaires appointed to\r\nCentral America at the last session of Congress, he was prevented from\r\nproceeding on his mission until the month of October. It is hoped,\r\nhowever, that he is by this time at his post, and that the official\r\nintercourse, unfortunately so long interrupted, has been thus renewed on\r\nthe part of the two nations so amicably and advantageously connected by\r\nengagements founded on the most enlarged principles of commercial\r\nreciprocity.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to state that since my last annual message some of the\r\nmost important claims of our fellow-citizens upon the Government of\r\nBrazil have been satisfactorily adjusted, and a reliance is placed on\r\nthe friendly dispositions manifested by it that justice will also be\r\ndone in others. No new causes of complaint have arisen, and the trade\r\nbetween the two countries flourishes under the encouragement secured\r\nto it by the liberal provisions of the treaty.\r\n\r\nIt is cause of regret that, owing, probably, to the civil dissensions\r\nwhich have occupied the attention of the Mexican Government, the time\r\nfixed by the treaty of limits with the United States for the meeting of\r\nthe commissioners to define the boundaries between the two nations has\r\nbeen suffered to expire without the appointment of any commissioners on\r\nthe part of that Government. While the true boundary remains in doubt by\r\neither party it is difficult to give effect to those measures which are\r\nnecessary to the protection and quiet of our numerous citizens residing\r\nnear that frontier. The subject is one of great solicitude to the United\r\nStates, and will not fail to receive my earnest attention.\r\n\r\nThe treaty concluded with Chili and approved by the Senate at its last\r\nsession was also ratified by the Chilian Government, but with certain\r\nadditional and explanatory articles of a nature to have required it to\r\nbe again submitted to the Senate. The time limited for the exchange of\r\nthe ratifications, however, having since expired, the action of both\r\nGovernments on the treaty will again become necessary.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations commenced with the Argentine Republic relative to\r\nthe outrages committed on our vessels engaged in the fisheries at the\r\nFalkland Islands by persons acting under the color of its authority, as\r\nwell as the other matters in controversy between the two Governments,\r\nhave been suspended by the departure of the chargé d'affaires of the\r\nUnited States from Buenos Ayres. It is understood, however, that a\r\nminister was subsequently appointed by that Government to renew the\r\nnegotiation in the United States, but though daily expected he has\r\nnot yet arrived in this country.\r\n\r\nWith Peru no treaty has yet been formed, and with Bolivia no diplomatic\r\nintercourse has yet been established. It will be my endeavor to\r\nencourage those sentiments of amity and that liberal commerce which\r\nbelong to the relations in which all the independent States of this\r\ncontinent stand toward each other.\r\n\r\nI deem it proper to recommend to your notice the revision of our\r\nconsular system. This has become an important branch of the public\r\nservice, inasmuch as it is intimately connected with the preservation\r\nof our national character abroad, with the interest of our citizens in\r\nforeign countries, with the regulation and care of our commerce, and\r\nwith the protection of our seamen. At the close of the last session of\r\nCongress I communicated a report from the Secretary of State upon the\r\nsubject, to which I now refer, as containing information which may be\r\nuseful in any inquiries that Congress may see fit to institute with a\r\nview to a salutary reform of the system.\r\n\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to congratulate you upon the prosperous\r\ncondition of the finances of the country, as will appear from the report\r\nwhich the Secretary of the Treasury will in due time lay before you.\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury during the present year will amount to\r\nmore than $32,000,000. The revenue derived from customs will, it is\r\nbelieved, be more than $28,000,000, and the public lands will yield about\r\n$3,000,000. The expenditures within the year for all objects, including\r\n$2,572,240.99 on account of the public debt, will not amount to\r\n$25,000,000, and a large balance will remain in the Treasury after\r\nsatisfying all the appropriations chargeable on the revenue for the\r\npresent year.\r\n\r\nThe measures taken by the Secretary of the Treasury will probably enable\r\nhim to pay off in the course of the present year the residue of the\r\nexchanged 4-1/2 per cent stock, redeemable on the 1st of January next.\r\nIt has therefore been included in the estimated expenditures of this\r\nyear, and forms a part of the sum above stated to have been paid on\r\naccount of the public debt. The payment of this stock will reduce the\r\nwhole debt of the United States, funded and unfunded, to the sum of\r\n$4,760,082.08, and as provision has already been made for the 4-1/2\r\npercents above mentioned, and charged in the expenses of the present\r\nyear, the sum last stated is all that now remains of the national debt;\r\nand the revenue of the coming year, together with the balance now in the\r\nTreasury, will be sufficient to discharge it, after meeting the current\r\nexpenses of the Government. Under the power given to the commissioners\r\nof the sinking fund, it will, I have no doubt, be purchased on favorable\r\nterms within the year.\r\n\r\nFrom this view of the state of the finances and the public engagements\r\nyet to be fulfilled you will perceive that if Providence permits me\r\nto meet you at another session I shall have the high gratification of\r\nannouncing to you that the national debt is extinguished. I can not\r\nrefrain from expressing the pleasure I feel at the near approach of that\r\ndesirable event. The short period of time within which the public debt\r\nwill have been discharged is strong evidence of the abundant resources\r\nof the country and of the prudence and economy with which the Government\r\nhas heretofore been administered. We have waged two wars since we became\r\na nation, with one of the most powerful kingdoms in the world, both of\r\nthem undertaken in defense of our dearest rights, both successfully\r\nprosecuted and honorably terminated; and many of those who partook in\r\nthe first struggle as well as in the second will have lived to see\r\nthe last item of the debt incurred in these necessary but expensive\r\nconflicts faithfully and honestly discharged. And we shall have the\r\nproud satisfaction of bequeathing to the public servants who follow us\r\nin the administration of the Government the rare blessing of a revenue\r\nsufficiently abundant, raised without injustice or oppression to our\r\ncitizens, and unencumbered with any burdens but what they themselves\r\nshall think proper to impose upon it.\r\n\r\nThe flourishing state of the finances ought not, however, to encourage\r\nus to indulge in a lavish expenditure of the public treasure. The\r\nreceipts of the present year do not furnish the test by which we are to\r\nestimate the income of the next. The changes made in our revenue system\r\nby the acts of Congress of 1832 and 1833, and more especially by the\r\nformer, have swelled the receipts of the present year far beyond the\r\namount to be expected in future years upon the reduced tariff of duties.\r\nThe shortened credits on revenue bonds and the cash duties on woolens\r\nwhich were introduced by the act of 1832, and took effect on the 4th of\r\nMarch last, have brought large sums into the Treasury in 1833, which,\r\naccording to the credits formerly given, would not have been payable\r\nuntil 1834, and would have formed a part of the income of that year.\r\nThese causes would of themselves produce a great diminution of the\r\nreceipts in the year 1834 as compared with the present one, and they\r\nwill be still more diminished by the reduced rates of duties which take\r\nplace on the 1st of January next on some of the most important and\r\nproductive articles. Upon the best estimates that can be made the\r\nreceipts of the next year, with the aid of the unappropriated amount\r\nnow in the Treasury, will not be much more than sufficient to meet the\r\nexpenses of the year and pay the small remnant of the national debt\r\nwhich yet remains unsatisfied. I can not, therefore, recommend to you\r\nany alteration in the present tariff of duties. The rate as now fixed by\r\nlaw on the various articles was adopted at the last session of Congress,\r\nas a matter of compromise, with unusual unanimity, and unless it is\r\nfound to produce more than the necessities of the Government call for\r\nthere would seem to be no reason at this time to justify a change.\r\n\r\nBut while I forbear to recommend any further reduction of the duties\r\nbeyond that already provided for by the existing laws, I must earnestly\r\nand respectfully press upon Congress the importance of abstaining from\r\nall appropriations which are not absolutely required for the public\r\ninterest and authorized by the powers clearly delegated to the United\r\nStates. We are beginning a new era in our Government. The national debt,\r\nwhich has so long been a burden on the Treasury, will be finally\r\ndischarged in the course of the ensuing year. No more money will\r\nafterwards be needed than what may be necessary to meet the ordinary\r\nexpenses of the Government. Now, then, is the proper moment to fix our\r\nsystem of expenditure on firm and durable principles, and I can not\r\ntoo strongly urge the necessity of a rigid economy and an inflexible\r\ndetermination not to enlarge the income beyond the real necessities\r\nof the Government and not to increase the wants of the Government by\r\nunnecessary and profuse expenditures. If a contrary course should be\r\npursued, it may happen that the revenue of 1834 will fall short of the\r\ndemands upon it, and after reducing the tariff in order to lighten the\r\nburdens of the people, and providing for a still further reduction to\r\ntake effect hereafter, it would be much to be deplored if at the end of\r\nanother year we should find ourselves obliged to retrace our steps and\r\nimpose additional taxes to meet unnecessary expenditures.\r\n\r\nIt is my duty on this occasion to call your attention to the\r\ndestruction of the public building occupied by the Treasury Department,\r\nwhich happened since the last adjournment of Congress. A thorough\r\ninquiry into the causes of this loss was directed and made at the time,\r\nthe result of which will be duly communicated to you. I take pleasure,\r\nhowever, in stating here that by the laudable exertions of the officers\r\nof the Department and many of the citizens of the District but few\r\npapers were lost, and none that will materially affect the public\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe public convenience requires that another building should be erected\r\nas soon as practicable, and in providing for it it will be advisable to\r\nenlarge in some manner the accommodations for the public officers of\r\nthe several Departments, and to authorize the erection of suitable\r\ndepositories for the safe-keeping of the public documents and records.\r\n\r\nSince the last adjournment of Congress the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nhas directed the money of the United States to be deposited in certain\r\nState banks designated by him, and he will immediately lay before you\r\nhis reasons for this direction. I concur with him entirely in the view\r\nhe has taken of the subject, and some months before the removal I urged\r\nupon the Department the propriety of taking that step. The near approach\r\nof the day on which the charter will expire, as well as the conduct\r\nof the bank, appeared to me to call for this measure upon the high\r\nconsiderations of public interest and public duty. The extent of its\r\nmisconduct, however, although known to be great, was not at that time\r\nfully developed by proof. It was not until late in the month of August\r\nthat I received from the Government directors an official report\r\nestablishing beyond question that this great and powerful institution\r\nhad been actively engaged in attempting to influence the elections of\r\nthe public officers by means of its money, and that, in violation of\r\nthe express provisions of its charter, it had by a formal resolution\r\nplaced its funds at the disposition of its president to be employed in\r\nsustaining the political power of the bank. A copy of this resolution is\r\ncontained in the report of the Government directors before referred to,\r\nand however the object may be disguised by cautious language, no one can\r\ndoubt that this money was in truth intended for electioneering purposes,\r\nand the particular uses to which it was proved to have been applied\r\nabundantly show that it was so understood. Not only was the evidence\r\ncomplete as to the past application of the money and power of the bank\r\nto electioneering purposes, but that the resolution of the board of\r\ndirectors authorized the same course to be pursued in future.\r\n\r\nIt being thus established by unquestionable proof that the Bank of the\r\nUnited States was converted into a permanent electioneering engine, it\r\nappeared to me that the path of duty which the executive department of\r\nthe Government ought to pursue was not doubtful. As by the terms of the\r\nbank charter no officer but the Secretary of the Treasury could remove\r\nthe deposits, it seemed to me that this authority ought to be at once\r\nexerted to deprive that great corporation of the support and countenance\r\nof the Government in such an use of its funds and such an exertion\r\nof its power. In this point of the case the question is distinctly\r\npresented whether the people of the United States are to govern through\r\nrepresentatives chosen by their unbiased suffrages or whether the money\r\nand power of a great corporation are to be secretly exerted to influence\r\ntheir judgment and control their decisions. It must now be determined\r\nwhether the bank is to have its candidates for all offices in the\r\ncountry, from the highest to the lowest, or whether candidates on both\r\nsides of political questions shall be brought forward as heretofore and\r\nsupported by the usual means.\r\n\r\nAt this time the efforts of the bank to control public opinion,\r\nthrough the distresses of some and the fears of others, are equally\r\napparent, and, if possible, more objectionable. By a curtailment of its\r\naccommodations more rapid than any emergency requires, and even while\r\nit retains specie to an almost unprecedented amount in its vaults,\r\nit is attempting to produce great embarrassment in one portion of the\r\ncommunity, while through presses known to have been sustained by its\r\nmoney it attempts by unfounded alarms to create a panic in all.\r\n\r\nThese are the means by which it seems to expect that it can force a\r\nrestoration of the deposits, and as a necessary consequence extort from\r\nCongress a renewal of its charter. I am happy to know that through the\r\ngood sense of our people the effort to get up a panic has hitherto\r\nfailed, and that through the increased accommodations which the State\r\nbanks have been enabled to afford, no public distress has followed the\r\nexertions of the bank, and it can not be doubted that the exercise of\r\nits power and the expenditure of its money, as well as its efforts to\r\nspread groundless alarm, will be met and rebuked as they deserve. In my\r\nown sphere of duty I should feel myself called on by the facts disclosed\r\nto order a _scire facias_ against the bank, with a view to put an end to\r\nthe chartered rights it has so palpably violated, were it not that the\r\ncharter itself will expire as soon as a decision would probably be\r\nobtained from the court of last resort.\r\n\r\nI called the attention of Congress to this subject in my last annual\r\nmessage, and informed them that such measures as were within the reach\r\nof the Secretary of the Treasury had been taken to enable him to judge\r\nwhether the public deposits in the Bank of the United States were\r\nentirely safe; but that as his single powers might be inadequate to the\r\nobject, I recommended the subject to Congress as worthy of their serious\r\ninvestigation, declaring it as my opinion that an inquiry into the\r\ntransactions of that institution, embracing the branches as well as the\r\nprincipal bank, was called for by the credit which was given throughout\r\nthe country to many serious charges impeaching their character, and\r\nwhich, if true, might justly excite the apprehension that they were no\r\nlonger a safe depository for the public money. The extent to which the\r\nexamination thus recommended was gone into is spread upon your journals,\r\nand is too well known to require to be stated. Such as was made resulted\r\nin a report from a majority of the Committee of Ways and Means touching\r\ncertain specified points only, concluding with a resolution that the\r\nGovernment deposits might safely be continued in the Bank of the United\r\nStates. This resolution was adopted at the close of the session by the\r\nvote of a majority of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nAlthough I may not always be able to concur in the views of the\r\npublic interest or the duties of its agents which may be taken by the\r\nother departments of the Government or either of its branches, I am,\r\nnotwithstanding, wholly incapable of receiving otherwise than with the\r\nmost sincere respect all opinions or suggestions proceeding from such a\r\nsource, and in respect to none am I more inclined to do so than to the\r\nHouse of Representatives. But it will be seen from the brief views at\r\nthis time taken of the subject by myself, as well as the more ample ones\r\npresented by the Secretary of the Treasury, that the change in the\r\ndeposits which has been ordered has been deemed to be called for by\r\nconsiderations which are not affected by the proceedings referred to,\r\nand which, if correctly viewed by that Department, rendered its act\r\na matter of imperious duty.\r\n\r\nComing as you do, for the most part, immediately from the people and the\r\nStates by election, and possessing the fullest opportunity to know their\r\nsentiments, the present Congress will be sincerely solicitous to carry\r\ninto full and fair effect the will of their constituents in regard to\r\nthis institution. It will be for those in whose behalf we all act to\r\ndecide whether the executive department of the Government, in the steps\r\nwhich it has taken on this subject, has been found in the line of its\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of War, with the documents\r\nannexed to it, exhibits the operations of the War Department for the\r\npast year and the condition of the various subjects intrusted to its\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from them that the Army maintains the character it has\r\nheretofore acquired for efficiency and military knowledge. Nothing has\r\noccurred since your last session to require its services beyond the\r\nordinary routine of duties which upon the seaboard and the inland\r\nfrontier devolve upon it in a time of peace. The system so wisely\r\nadopted and so long pursued of constructing fortifications at exposed\r\npoints and of preparing and collecting the supplies necessary for the\r\nmilitary defense of the country, and thus providently furnishing in\r\npeace the means of defense in war, has been continued with the usual\r\nresults. I recommend to your consideration the various subjects\r\nsuggested in the report of the Secretary of War. Their adoption would\r\npromote the public service and meliorate the condition of the Army.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the various Indian tribes have been undisturbed\r\nsince the termination of the difficulties growing out of the hostile\r\naggressions of the Sac and Fox Indians. Several treaties have been\r\nformed for the relinquishment of territory to the United States and\r\nfor the migration of the occupants of the region assigned for their\r\nresidence west of the Mississippi. Should these treaties be ratified by\r\nthe Senate, provision will have been made for the removal of almost all\r\nthe tribes now remaining east of that river and for the termination of\r\nmany difficult and embarrassing questions arising out of their anomalous\r\npolitical condition. It is to be hoped that those portions of two of the\r\nSouthern tribes, which in that event will present the only remaining\r\ndifficulties, will realize the necessity of emigration, and will\r\nspeedily resort to it. My original convictions upon this subject have\r\nbeen confirmed by the course of events for several years, and experience\r\nis every day adding to their strength.\r\n\r\nThat those tribes can not exist surrounded by our settlements and in\r\ncontinual contact with our citizens is certain. They have neither\r\nthe intelligence, the industry, the moral habits, nor the desire of\r\nimprovement which are essential to any favorable change in their\r\ncondition. Established in the midst of another and a superior race,\r\nand without appreciating the causes of their inferiority or seeking to\r\ncontrol them, they must necessarily yield to the force of circumstances\r\nand ere long disappear. Such has been their fate heretofore, and if it\r\nis to be averted--and it is--it can only be done by a general removal\r\nbeyond our boundary and by the reorganization of their political system\r\nupon principles adapted to the new relations in which they will be\r\nplaced. The experiment which has been recently made has so far proved\r\nsuccessful. The emigrants generally are represented to be prosperous\r\nand contented, the country suitable to their wants and habits, and the\r\nessential articles of subsistence easily procured. When the report\r\nof the commissioners now engaged in investigating the condition and\r\nprospects of these Indians and in devising a plan for their intercourse\r\nand government is received, I trust ample means of information will\r\nbe in possession of the Government for adjusting all the unsettled\r\nquestions connected with this interesting subject.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Navy during the year and its present condition are\r\nfully exhibited in the annual report from the Navy Department.\r\n\r\nSuggestions are made by the Secretary of various improvements, which\r\ndeserve careful consideration, and most of which, if adopted, bid fair\r\nto promote the efficiency of this important branch of the public\r\nservice. Among these are the new organization of the Navy Board, the\r\nrevision of the pay to officers, and a change in the period of time or\r\nin the manner of making the annual appropriations, to which I beg leave\r\nto call your particular attention.\r\n\r\nThe views which are presented on almost every portion of our naval\r\nconcerns, and especially on the amount of force and the number of\r\nofficers, and the general course of policy appropriate in the present\r\nstate of our country for securing the great and useful purposes of naval\r\nprotection in peace and due preparation for the contingencies of war,\r\nmeet with my entire approbation.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived from the report referred to that the fiscal\r\nconcerns of the establishment are in an excellent condition, and it is\r\nhoped that Congress may feel disposed to make promptly every suitable\r\nprovision desired either for preserving or improving the system.\r\n\r\nThe general Post-Office Department has continued, upon the strength of\r\nits own resources, to facilitate the means of communication between\r\nthe various portions of the Union with increased activity. The method,\r\nhowever, in which the accounts of the transportation of the mail have\r\nalways been kept appears to have presented an imperfect view of its\r\nexpenses. It has recently been discovered that from the earliest records\r\nof the Department the annual statements have been calculated to exhibit\r\nan amount considerably short of the actual expense incurred for that\r\nservice. These illusory statements, together with the expense of\r\ncarrying into effect the law of the last session of Congress\r\nestablishing new mail routes, and a disposition on the part of the head\r\nof the Department to gratify the wishes of the public in the extension\r\nof mail facilities, have induced him to incur responsibilities for their\r\nimprovement beyond what the current resources of the Department would\r\nsustain. As soon as he had discovered the imperfection of the method he\r\ncaused an investigation to be made of its results and applied the proper\r\nremedy to correct the evil. It became necessary for him to withdraw some\r\nof the improvements which he had made to bring the expenses of the\r\nDepartment within its own resources. These expenses were incurred for\r\nthe public good, and the public have enjoyed their benefit. They are now\r\nbut partially suspended, and that where they may be discontinued with\r\nthe least inconvenience to the country.\r\n\r\nThe progressive increase in the income from postages has equaled the\r\nhighest expectations, and it affords demonstrative evidence of the\r\ngrowing importance and great utility of this Department. The details\r\nare exhibited in the accompanying report of the Postmaster-General.\r\n\r\nThe many distressing accidents which have of late occurred in that\r\nportion of our navigation carried on by the use of steam power deserve\r\nthe immediate and unremitting attention of the constituted authorities\r\nof the country. The fact that the number of those fatal disasters is\r\nconstantly increasing, notwithstanding the great improvements which are\r\neverywhere made in the machinery employed and in the rapid advances\r\nwhich have been made in that branch of science, shows very clearly that\r\nthey are in a great degree the result of criminal negligence on the\r\npart of those by whom the vessels are navigated and to whose care and\r\nattention the lives and property of our citizens are so extensively\r\nintrusted.\r\n\r\nThat these evils may be greatly lessened, if not substantially removed,\r\nby means of precautionary and penal legislation seems to be highly\r\nprobable. So far, therefore, as the subject can be regarded as within\r\nthe constitutional purview of Congress I earnestly recommend it to your\r\nprompt and serious consideration.\r\n\r\nI would also call your attention to the views I have heretofore\r\nexpressed of the propriety of amending the Constitution in relation to\r\nthe mode of electing the President and the Vice-President of the United\r\nStates. Regarding it as all important to the future quiet and harmony\r\nof the people that every intermediate agency in the election of these\r\nofficers should be removed and that their eligibility should be limited\r\nto one term of either four or six years, I can not too earnestly invite\r\nyour consideration of the subject.\r\n\r\nTrusting that your deliberations on all the topics of general\r\ninterest to which I have adverted, and such others as your more\r\nextensive knowledge of the wants of our beloved country may suggest,\r\nmay be crowned with success, I tender you in conclusion the cooperation\r\nwhich it may be in my power to afford them.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 5, 1833_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate at its last session,\r\nrequesting the President \"to cause to be prepared and laid before the\r\nSenate at the commencement of its next session a plan for equalizing the\r\npay of the officers in the Army and Navy according to their relative\r\nrank, and providing a stated salary or fixed compensation for their\r\nservices in lieu of present allowances,\" I submit herewith a report from\r\nthe Secretaries of the War and Navy Departments, to whom the subject was\r\nreferred. It is believed the plan they have presented meets\r\nsubstantially the objects of the resolution.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 6, 1833_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the House of Representatives a communication from\r\nthe War Department, showing the circumstances under which the sum of\r\n$5,000, appropriated for subsistence of the Army, was transferred to the\r\nservice of the medical and hospital department, and which, by the law\r\nauthorizing the transfer, are required to be laid before Congress during\r\nthe first week of their session.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 6, 1833_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of the House, the report of the\r\nsurvey made in pursuance of the fourth section of the act of Congress of\r\nthe 4th July, 1832, authorizing the survey of canal routes in the\r\nTerritory of Florida.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 11, 1833_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nexhibiting certain transfers of appropriations that have been made in\r\nthat Department in pursuance of the power vested in the President by the\r\nfirst section of the act of Congress of the 3d March, 1809, entitled\r\n\"An act further to amend the several acts for the establishment and\r\nregulation of the Treasury, War, and Navy Departments.\"\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 12, 1833_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have attentively considered the resolution of the Senate of the 11th\r\ninstant, requesting the President of the United States to communicate\r\nto the Senate \"a copy of the paper which has been published, and which\r\npurports to have been read by him to the heads of the Executive\r\nDepartments, dated the 18th day of September last, relating to the\r\nremoval of the deposits of the public money from the Bank of the United\r\nStates and its offices.\"\r\n\r\nThe executive is a coordinate and independent branch of the Government\r\nequally with the Senate, and I have yet to learn under what\r\nconstitutional authority that branch of the Legislature has a right to\r\nrequire of me an account of any communication, either verbally or in\r\nwriting, made to the heads of Departments acting as a Cabinet council.\r\nAs well might I be required to detail to the Senate the free and private\r\nconversations I have held with those officers on any subject relating to\r\ntheir duties and my own.\r\n\r\nFeeling my responsibility to the American people, I am willing upon all\r\noccasions to explain to them the grounds of my conduct, and I am willing\r\nupon all proper occasions to give to either branch of the Legislature\r\nany information in my possession that can be useful in the execution of\r\nthe appropriate duties confided to them.\r\n\r\nKnowing the constitutional rights of the Senate, I shall be the last man\r\nunder any circumstances to interfere with them. Knowing those of the\r\nExecutive, I shall at all times endeavor to maintain them agreeably to\r\nthe provisions of the Constitution and the solemn oath I have taken to\r\nsupport and defend it.\r\n\r\nI am constrained, therefore, by a proper sense of my own self-respect\r\nand of the rights secured by the Constitution to the executive branch of\r\nthe Government to decline a compliance with your request.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 23, 1833_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe rules and regulations herewith submitted have been prepared by a\r\nboard of officers in conformity with an act passed May 19, 1832.[1]\r\n\r\nThey are approved by me, and in pursuance of the provisions of said act\r\nare now communicated to the House of Representatives for the purpose of\r\nobtaining to them the sanction of Congress.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: An act authorizing the revision and extension of the rules\r\nand regulations of the naval service.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 24, 1833_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of the Senate as to the\r\nratification thereof, the following Indian treaties that have been\r\nreceived since the adjournment of the last session of Congress, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Treaty with the Seminole Indians, made May 9, 1832.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. Treaty with the Cherokees west of the Mississippi, made\r\n14th February, 1833.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. Treaty with the Creeks west of the Mississippi, made 14th\r\nFebruary, 1833.\r\n\r\nNo. 4. Assignment to the Seminoles of a tract of land for their\r\nresidence west of the Mississippi, made 28th March, 1833.\r\n\r\nNo. 5. Agreement with the Apalachiccla band of Indians, made 18th\r\nJune, 1833.\r\n\r\nNo. 6. Treaty with the united bands of Ottoes and Missourians, made\r\n21st September, 1833.\r\n\r\nNo. 7. Treaty with the four confederated bands of Pawnees residing\r\non the Platt and Loup Fork, made 9th October, 1833.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 6, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress an extract of a letter recently received from\r\nR.J. Leib, consul of the United States at Tangier, by which it appears\r\nthat that officer has been induced to receive from the Emperor of\r\nMorocco a present of a lion and two horses, which he holds as belonging\r\nto the United States. There being no funds at the disposal of the\r\nExecutive applicable to the objects stated by Mr. Leib, I submit the\r\nwhole subject to the consideration of Congress for such direction as\r\nin their wisdom may seem proper.\r\n\r\nI have directed instructions to be given to all our ministers and agents\r\nabroad requiring that in future, unless previously authorized by\r\nCongress, they will not under any circumstances accept presents of any\r\ndescription from any foreign state.\r\n\r\nI deem it proper on this occasion to invite the attention of Congress\r\nto the presents which have heretofore been made to our public officers,\r\nand which have been deposited under the orders of the Government in\r\nthe Department of State. These articles are altogether useless to the\r\nGovernment, and the care and preservation of them in the Department\r\nof State are attended with considerably inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe provision of the Constitution which forbids any officer, without the\r\nconsent of Congress, to accept any present from any foreign power may be\r\nconsidered as having been satisfied by the surrender of the articles to\r\nthe Government, and they might now be disposed of by Congress to those\r\nfor whom they were originally intended, or to their heirs, with obvious\r\npropriety in both cases, and in the latter would be received as grateful\r\nmemorials of the surrender of the present.\r\n\r\nAs under the positive order now given similar presents can not hereafter\r\nbe received, even for the purpose of being placed at the disposal of the\r\nGovernment, I recommend to Congress to authorize by law that the\r\narticles already in the Department of State shall be delivered to the\r\npersons to whom they were originally presented, if living, and to the\r\nheirs of such as may have died.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 7, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution requesting the President of the United\r\nStates to lay before the House \"a copy of any contract which may have\r\nbeen made for the construction of a bridge across the Potomac opposite\r\nto the city of Washington, together with the authority under which such\r\ncontract may have been made, the names of the contractors and their\r\nsecurities, if any, and the plan and estimate of the cost of such a\r\nbridge,\" I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, to whom the resolution was referred, containing all the\r\ninformation upon the subject which he is now able to communicate.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 9, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for their constitutional action, a treaty\r\nconcluded between the commissioners on the part of the United States and\r\nthe united nation of Chippewas, Ottawas, and Potawatamies, at Chicago,\r\non the 26th of September, 1833, to the cession of certain lands in the\r\nState of Illinois and Territory of Michigan.\r\n\r\nI transmit also sundry documents relating thereto that I think proper\r\nshould be laid before the Senate.\r\n\r\nI understand the country ceded by this treaty is considered a valuable\r\none and its acquisition important to that section of the Union. Under\r\nthese circumstances, as the objection to a ratification applies to\r\nthose stipulations in the third article which provide that $100,000 and\r\n$150,000 shall be granted in satisfaction of claims to reservations and\r\nfor debts due from the Indians to individuals, I recommend that the\r\ntreaty be ratified, with the condition that an agent be appointed to\r\nproceed to Chicago investigate the justice of these claims. If they are\r\nall well founded and have been assented to by the Indians with a full\r\nknowledge of the circumstances, a proper investigation of them will do\r\nthe claimants no injury, but will place the matter beyond suspicion. If,\r\non the other hand, they are unjust and have not been fully understood by\r\nthe Indians, the fraud will in that event vitiate them, and they ought\r\nnot to be paid. To the United States, in a mere pecuniary point of view,\r\nit is of no importance to whom the money provided by this treaty is\r\npaid. They stipulate to pay a given amount, and that amount they must\r\npay, but the consideration is yielded by the Indians, and they are\r\nentitled to its value. Whatever is granted in claims must be withheld\r\nfrom them, and if not so granted it becomes theirs. Considering the\r\nrelations in which the Indians stand to the United States, it appears\r\nto me just to exercise their supervisory authority. It has been done in\r\nmore than one instance, and as its object in this case is to ascertain\r\nwhether any fraud exists, and if there does to correct it, I consider\r\nsuch a ratification within the proper scope of the treaty-making power.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 22, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a report[2] from the Secretary of State,\r\ncontaining the information requested by their resolution of the 9th\r\ninstant, with the documents which accompany that report.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Relating to presents from foreign governments to officers\r\nof the United States.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 25, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the House of Representatives a letter from the\r\nSecretary of State, together with the accompanying papers, relating to\r\na claim preferred to that Department, through the British legation at\r\nWashington, for indemnification for losses alleged to have been\r\nsustained by the owners of the ship _Francis and Eliza_, libeled at New\r\nOrleans in 1819, and condemned and sold by the sentence and decree of\r\nthe district court of the United States for the district of Louisiana,\r\nbut afterwards restored upon an appeal to the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, that such legislative provision may be made by Congress\r\nin behalf of those interested as shall appear just and proper in the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 4, 1834.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI deem it my duty to communicate to Congress the recent conduct of the\r\nBank of the United States in refusing to deliver the books, papers, and\r\nfunds in its possession relating to the execution of the act of Congress\r\nof June 7, 1832, entitled \"An act supplementary to the 'Act for the\r\nrelief of certain surviving officers and soldiers of the Revolution.'\"\r\nThe correspondence reported by the Secretary of War, and herewith\r\ntransmitted, will show the grounds assumed by the bank to justify its\r\nrefusal to make the transfer directed by the War Department. It does not\r\nprofess to claim the privilege of this agency as a right secured to it\r\nby contract, nor as a benefit conferred by the Government, but as a\r\nburden, from which it is willing to be relieved. It places its refusal\r\nupon the extraordinary ground that the corporation has a right to sit in\r\njudgment upon the legality of the acts of the constituted authorities in\r\na matter in which the stockholders are admitted to have no interest, and\r\nit impedes and defeats, as far as its power will permit, the execution\r\nof a measure of the Administration, because the opinion of the\r\ncorporation upon the construction of an act of Congress differs from\r\nthat of the proper officers of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe claim of this corporation thus to usurp the functions of the\r\njudicial power and to prescribe to the executive department the manner\r\nin which it shall execute the trust confided to it by law is without\r\nexample in the history of our country. If the acts of the public\r\nservants, who are responsible to the people for the manner in which\r\nthey execute their duty, may thus be checked and controlled by an\r\nirresponsible money corporation, then indeed the whole frame of our\r\nGovernment is changed, and we have established a power in the Bank\r\nof the United States above what we derive from the people.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the accompanying statement (marked A) that\r\naccording to the latest accounts received at the War Department the Bank\r\nof the United States and its branches have in their possession near half\r\na million of the public money, received by them under the law of 1832,\r\nwhich they have not yet accounted for, and which they refuse to pay over\r\nto the proper agents for the use of those persons for whose benefit it\r\nwas withdrawn from the Treasury. It is to be regretted that this attempt\r\non the part of the bank to guide and direct the Executive upon the\r\nconstruction and execution of an act of Congress should have been put\r\nforward and insisted on in a case where the immediate sufferers from\r\ntheir conduct will be the surviving veterans of the Revolutionary war,\r\nfor this evil falls exclusively upon the gallant defenders of their\r\ncountry and delays and embarrasses the payment of the debt which the\r\ngratitude of the nation has awarded to them, and which in many instances\r\nis necessary for their subsistence and comfort in their declining years.\r\n\r\nThe character of the claim set up by the bank and the interest of the\r\nparties to be immediately affected by it make it my duty to submit the\r\nwhole subject to the consideration of Congress, and I leave it to their\r\nwisdom to adopt such measures as the honor of the Government and the\r\njust claims of the individuals injured by the proceedings may be deemed\r\nto require.\r\n\r\nHaving called for the opinion of the Attorney-General upon this occasion\r\nwith a view to a thorough investigation of the question which has thus\r\nbeen presented for my consideration, I inclose a copy of the report of\r\nthat officer and add my entire concurrence in the views he has taken.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 12, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report[3] from the\r\nSecretary of State, in relation to the subject of a resolution of the\r\n8th of this month.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Relating to the boundary line between Georgia and Florida.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 12, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report from the Secretary\r\nof State, containing the information requested[4] by the resolution of\r\nthe 14th ultimo, with the documents which accompanied that report.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: List of presents from foreign governments to officers of\r\nthe United States, deposited in the State Department.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 22, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for their advice concerning its\r\nratification, an additional and explanatory convention to the treaty of\r\npeace, amity, commerce, and navigation between the United States and\r\nthe Republic of Chile, which additional and explanatory convention was\r\nconcluded at the city of Santiago by the plenipotentiaries of the United\r\nStates and of Chile on the 1st of September, 1833. I also transmit a\r\nreport from the Secretary of State on the subject.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 8, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the House a report from the Secretary of State,\r\ncontaining the instructions and other papers called for by the\r\nresolution of the House of the 14th ultimo, \"relative to the trade\r\nbetween the United States and the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico,\" etc.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 11, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI renominate Henry D. Gilpin, Peter Wager, and John T. Sullivan, of\r\nPhiladelphia, and Hugh McEldery, of Baltimore, to be directors in the\r\nBank of the United States for the year 1834.\r\n\r\nI disclaim all pretension of right on the part of the President\r\nofficially to inquire into or call in question the reasons of the\r\nSenate for rejecting any nomination whatsoever. As the President is\r\nnot responsible to them for the reasons which induce him to make a\r\nnomination, so they are not responsible to him for the reasons which\r\ninduce them to reject it. In these respects each is independent of\r\nthe other and both responsible to their respective constituents.\r\nNevertheless, the attitude in which certain vital interests of the\r\ncountry are placed by the rejection of the gentlemen now renominated\r\nrequire of me frankly to communicate my views of the consequences\r\nwhich must necessarily follow this act of the Senate if it be not\r\nreconsidered.\r\n\r\nThe characters and standing of these gentlemen are well known to the\r\ncommunity, and eminently qualify them for the offices to which I propose\r\nto appoint them. Their confirmation by the Senate at its last session to\r\nthe same offices is proof that such was the opinion of them entertained\r\nby the Senate at that time, and unless something has occurred since to\r\nchange it this act may now be referred to as evidence that their talents\r\nand pursuits justified their selection. The refusal, however, to confirm\r\ntheir nominations to the same offices shows that there is something\r\nin the conduct of these gentlemen during the last year which, in the\r\nopinion of the Senate, disqualifies them, and as no charge has been\r\nmade against them as men or citizens, nothing which impeaches the\r\nfair private character they possessed when the Senate gave them their\r\nsanction at its last session, and as it, moreover, appears from the\r\nJournal of the Senate recently transmitted for my inspection that it was\r\ndeemed unnecessary to inquire into their qualifications or character,\r\nit is to be inferred that the change in the opinion of the Senate\r\nhas arisen from the official conduct of these gentlemen. The only\r\ncircumstances in their official conduct which have been deemed of\r\nsufficient importance to attract public attention are the two reports\r\nmade by them to the executive department of the Government, the one\r\nbearing date the 22d day of April and the other the 19th day of August\r\nlast, both of which reports were communicated to the Senate by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury with his reasons for removing the deposit.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the facts stated in these reports is not, I presume,\r\nquestioned by anyone. The high character and standing of the citizens\r\nby whom they were made prevent any doubt upon the subject. Indeed, the\r\nstatements have not been denied by the president of the bank and the\r\nother directors. On the contrary, they have insisted that they were\r\nauthorized to use the money of the bank in the manner stated in the two\r\nreports, and have not denied that the charges there made against the\r\ncorporation are substantially true.\r\n\r\nIt must be taken, therefore, as admitted that the statements of the\r\npublic directors in the reports above mentioned are correct, and they\r\ndisclose the most alarming abuses on the part of the corporation and the\r\nmost strenuous exertions on their part to put an end to them. They prove\r\nthat enormous sums were secretly lavished in a manner and for purposes\r\nthat can not be justified, and that the whole of the immense capital\r\nof the bank has been virtually placed at the disposal of a single\r\nindividual, to be used, if he thinks proper, to corrupt the press and\r\nto control the proceedings of the Government by exercising an undue\r\ninfluence over elections.\r\n\r\nThe reports are made in obedience to my official directions, and I\r\nherewith transmit copies of my letters calling for information of the\r\nproceedings of the bank. Were they bound to disregard the call? Was it\r\ntheir duty to remain silent while abuses of the most injurious and\r\ndangerous character were daily practiced? Were they bound to conceal\r\nfrom the constituted authorities a course of measures destructive to the\r\nbest interests of the country and intended gradually and secretly to\r\nsubvert the foundations of our Government and to transfer its powers\r\nfrom the hands of the people to a great moneyed corporation? Was it\r\ntheir duty to sit in silence at the board and witness all these abuses\r\nwithout an attempt to correct them, or, in case of failure there, not to\r\nappeal to higher authority? The eighth fundamental rule authorizes any\r\none of the directors, whether elected or appointed, who may have been\r\nabsent when an excess of debt was created, or who may have dissented\r\nfrom the act, to exonerate himself from personal responsibility by\r\ngiving notice of the fact to the President of the United States,\r\nthus recognizing the propriety of communicating to that officer the\r\nproceedings of the board in such cases. But independently of any\r\nargument to be derived from the principle recognized in the rule\r\nreferred to, I can not doubt for a moment that it is the right and the\r\nduty of every director at the board to attempt to correct all illegal\r\nproceedings, and, in case of failure, to disclose them, and that every\r\none of them, whether elected by the stockholders or appointed by the\r\nGovernment, who had knowledge of the facts and concealed them, would be\r\njustly amenable to the severest censure.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of the public director it was their peculiar and\r\nofficial duty to make the disclosures, and the call upon them for\r\ninformation could not have been disregarded without a flagrant breach\r\nof their trust. The directors appointed by the United States can not be\r\nregarded in the light of the ordinary directors of a bank appointed by\r\nthe stockholders and charged with the care of their pecuniary interests\r\nin the corporation. They have higher and more important duties. They are\r\npublic officers. They are placed at the board not merely to represent\r\nthe stock held by the United States, but to observe the conduct of the\r\ncorporation and to watch over the public interests. It was foreseen\r\nthat this great moneyed monopoly might be so managed as to endanger the\r\ninterests of the country, and it was therefore deemed necessary as a\r\nmeasure of precaution to place at the board watchful sentinels, who\r\nshould observe its conduct and stand ready to report to the proper\r\nofficers of the Government every act of the board which might affect\r\ninjuriously the interests of the people.\r\n\r\nThe whole frame of the charter, as well as the manner of their\r\nappointment, proves this to be their true character. The United States\r\nare not represented at the board by these directors merely on account\r\nof the stock held by the Government. The right of the United States to\r\nappoint directors and the number appointed do not depend upon the amount\r\nof the stock, for if every share should be sold and the United States\r\ncease to be a stockholder altogether, yet under the charter the right\r\nto appoint five directors would still remain. In such a case what would\r\nbe the character of the directors? They would represent no stock and\r\nbe chosen by no stockholders. Yet they would have a right to sit at\r\nthe board, to vote on all questions submitted to it, and to be made\r\nacquainted with all the proceedings of the corporation. They would not\r\nin such a case be ordinary directors chosen by the stockholders in\r\nproportion to their stock, but they would be public officers, appointed\r\nto guard the public interest, and their duties must conform to their\r\noffice. They are not the duties of an ordinary director chosen by a\r\nstockholder, but they are the peculiar duties of a public officer who\r\nis bound on all occasions to protect to the utmost of his lawful means\r\nthe public interests, and, where his own authority is not sufficient\r\nto prevent injury, to inform those to whom the law has confided the\r\nnecessary power. Such, then, is the character and such are the duties\r\nof the directors appointed by the United States, whether the public be\r\nstockholders or not. They are officers of the United States, and not\r\nthe mere representatives of a stockholder.\r\n\r\nThe mode of their appointment and their tenure of office confirm this\r\nposition. They are appointed like other officers of the Government and\r\nby the same authority. They do not hold their offices irrevocably a year\r\nafter their appointment; on the contrary, by the express terms of the\r\nlaw, they are liable to be removed from office at any time by the\r\nPresident when in his judgment the public interest shall require it.\r\nIn every aspect, therefore, in which the subject can be considered it is\r\nevident that the five directors appointed by the United States are to be\r\nregarded as public officers who are placed there in order to observe the\r\nconduct of the corporation and to prevent abuses which might otherwise\r\nbe committed.\r\n\r\nSuch being the character of the directors appointed on behalf of the\r\nUnited States, it is obviously their duty to resist, and in case of\r\nfailure to report to the President or to the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nany proceedings of the board by which the public interests may be\r\ninjuriously affected. The President may order a _scire facias_ against\r\nthe bank for a violation of its charter, and the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury is empowered to direct the money of the United States to be\r\ndeposited elsewhere when in his judgment the public interest requires it\r\nto be done. The directors of this bank, like all others, are accustomed\r\nto sit with closed doors, and do not report their proceedings to any\r\ndepartment of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe monthly return which the charter requires to be made to the Treasury\r\nDepartment gives nothing more than a general statement of its pecuniary\r\ncondition, and of that but an imperfect one; for although it shows the\r\namount loaned at the bank and its different branches, it does not show\r\nthe condition of its debtors nor the circumstances under which the loans\r\nwere made. It does not show whether they were in truth accommodations\r\ngranted in the regular and ordinary course of business upon fair banking\r\nprinciples or from other motives. Under the name of loans advances may\r\nbe made to persons notoriously insolvent for the most corrupt and\r\nimproper purposes, and a course of proceeding may be adopted in\r\nviolation of its charter, while upon the face of its monthly statement\r\neverything would appear to be fair and correct.\r\n\r\nHow, then, is the executive branch of the Government to become\r\nacquainted with the official conduct of the public directors or the\r\nabuses practiced by the corporation for its private ends and in\r\nviolation of its duty to the public? The power of displacing the public\r\ndirectors and that of issuing a _scire facias_ and of removing the\r\ndeposits were not intended to be idle and nugatory provisions without\r\nthe means of enforcement. Yet they must be wholly inoperative and\r\nuseless unless there be some means by which the official conduct of the\r\npublic directors and the abuses of power on the part of the corporation\r\nmay be brought to the knowledge of the executive department of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nWill it be said that the power is given to the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury to examine himself, or by his authorized agent, into the\r\nconduct and condition of the bank? The answer is obvious. It could not\r\nhave been expected or intended that he would make an examination unless\r\ninformation was first given to him which excited his suspicions; and\r\nif he did make such a general examination without previous information\r\nof misconduct, it is most probable that in the complex concerns and\r\naccounts of a bank it would result in nothing, whatever abuses might\r\nhave been practiced.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, the duty of every director to give information of such\r\nmisconduct on the part of the board. But the power to issue a _scire\r\nfacias_ and to remove the deposits presupposes that the directors\r\nelected by the stockholders might abuse their power, and it can not be\r\npresumed that Congress intended to rely on these same directors to give\r\ninformation of their own misconduct. The Government is not accustomed\r\nto rely on the offending party to disclose his offense. It was intended\r\nthat the power to issue a _scire facias_ and remove the deposits be\r\nreal and effective. The necessary means of information were therefore\r\nprovided in the charter, and five officers of the Government, appointed\r\nin the usual manner, responsible to the public and not to the\r\nstockholders, were placed as sentinels at the board, and are bound by\r\nthe nature and character of their office to resist, and if unsuccessful\r\nto report to the proper authority, every infraction of the charter and\r\nevery abuse of power, in order that due measures should be taken to\r\npunish or correct it; and in like manner it is their duty to give, when\r\ncalled upon, any explanation of their own official conduct touching the\r\nmanagement of the institution.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps scarcely necessary to present to the Senate these views\r\nof the power of the Executive and of the duties of the five directors\r\nappointed by the United States. But the bank is believed to be now\r\nstriving to obtain for itself the government of the country, and is\r\nseeking by new and strained constructions to wrest from the hands of the\r\nconstituted authorities the salutary control reserved by the charter;\r\nand as misrepresentation is one of its most usual weapons of attack,\r\nI have deemed it my duty to put before the Senate in a manner not to be\r\nmisunderstood the principles on which I have acted.\r\n\r\nEntertaining as I do a solemn conviction of the truth of these\r\nprinciples, I must adhere to them and act upon them with constancy and\r\nfirmness. Aware as I now am of the dangerous machinations of the bank,\r\nit is more than ever my duty to be vigilant in guarding the rights of\r\nthe people from the impending danger. And I should feel that I ought to\r\nforfeit the confidence with which my countrymen have honored me if I did\r\nnot require regular and full reports of everything in the proceedings\r\nof the bank calculated to affect injuriously the public interests from\r\nthe public directors; and if the directors should fail to give the\r\ninformation called for, it would be my imperious duty to exercise\r\nthe power conferred on me by law of removing them from office and of\r\nappointing others who would discharge their duties with more fidelity to\r\nthe public. I can never suffer anyone to hold office under me who would\r\nconnive at corruption or who should fail to give the alarm when he saw\r\nthe enemies of liberty endeavoring to sap the foundations of our free\r\ninstitutions and to subject the free people of the United States to the\r\ndominion of a great moneyed corporation.\r\n\r\nAny directors of the bank, therefore, who might be appointed by the\r\nGovernment would be required to report to the Executive as fully as the\r\nlate directors have done, and more frequently, because the danger is\r\nmore imminent; and it would be my duty to require of them a full detail\r\nof every part of the proceedings of the corporation, or any of its\r\nofficers, in order that I might be enabled to decide whether I should\r\nexercise the power of ordering a _scire facias_, which is reserved to\r\nthe President by the charter, or adopt such other lawful measures as the\r\ninterests of the country might require. It is too obvious to be doubted\r\nthat the misconduct of the corporation would never have been brought to\r\nlight by the aid of a public proceeding at the board of directors. The\r\nboard when called on by the Government directors refused to institute an\r\ninquiry or require an account, and the mode adopted by the latter was\r\nthe only one by which the object could be attained. It would be absurd\r\nto admit the right of the Government directors to give information and\r\nat the same time deny the means of obtaining it. It would be but another\r\nmode of enabling the bank to conceal its proceedings and practice with\r\nimpunity its corruptions. In the mode of obtaining the information,\r\ntherefore, and in their efforts to put an end to the abuses disclosed,\r\nas well as in reporting them, the conduct of the late directors was\r\njudicious and praiseworthy, and the honesty, firmness, and intelligence\r\nwhich they have displayed entitle them, in my opinion, to the gratitude\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nBut if I do not mistake the principles on which the Senate have recently\r\nrejected them, the conduct which I deem worthy of praise they treat as\r\na breach of duty, and in their judgment the measures which they took to\r\nobtain the informations and their efforts to put an end to the practices\r\ndisclosed and the reports they have made to the Executive, although true\r\nin all their parts, are regarded as an offense and supposed to require\r\nsome decisive mark of strong disapprobation.\r\n\r\nIf the views of the Senate be such as I have supposed, the difficulty of\r\nsending to the Senate any other names than those of the late directors\r\nwill be at once apparent. I can not consent to place before the Senate\r\nthe name of anyone who is not prepared with firmness and honesty to\r\ndischarge the duties of a public director in the manner they were\r\nfulfilled by those whom the Senate have refused to confirm. If for\r\nperforming a duty lawfully required of them by the Executive they are\r\nto be punished by the subsequent rejection of the Senate, it would not\r\nonly be useless, but cruel, to place men of character and honor in that\r\nsituation, if even such men could be found to accept it. If they failed\r\nto give the required information or to take proper measures to obtain\r\nit, they would be removed by the Executive. If they gave the information\r\nand took proper measures to obtain it, they would upon the next\r\nnomination be rejected by the Senate. It would be unjust in me to place\r\nany other citizens in the predicament in which this unlooked-for\r\ndecision of the Senate has placed the estimable and honorable men who\r\nwere directors during the last year.\r\n\r\nIf I am not in error in relation to the principles upon which these\r\ngentlemen have been rejected, the necessary consequence will be that\r\nthe bank will hereafter be without Government directors, and the people\r\nof the United States must be deprived of their chief means of protection\r\nagainst its abuses, for whatever conflicting opinions may exist as to\r\nthe right of the directors appointed in January, 1833, to hold over\r\nuntil new appointments shall be made, it is very obvious that whilst\r\ntheir rejection by the Senate remains in force they can not with\r\npropriety attempt to exercise such a power. In the present state of\r\nthings, therefore, the corporation will be enabled effectually to\r\naccomplish the object it has been so long endeavoring to attain.\r\nIts exchange committees and its delegated powers to its president may\r\nhereafter be dispensed with without incurring the danger of exposing\r\nits proceedings to the public view. The sentinels which the law had\r\nplaced at its board can no longer appear there.\r\n\r\nJustice to myself and to the faithful officers by whom the public has\r\nbeen so well and so honorably served without compensation or reward\r\nduring the last year has required of me this full and frank exposition\r\nof my motives for nominating them again after their rejection by the\r\nSenate. I repeat that I do not question the right of the Senate to\r\nconfirm or reject at their pleasure, and if there had been any reason\r\nto suppose that the rejection in this case had not been produced by the\r\ncauses to which I have attributed it, or if my views of their duties and\r\nthe present importance of their rigid performance were other than they\r\nare, I should have cheerfully acquiesced and attempted to find others\r\nwho would accept the unenviable trust; but I can not consent to appoint\r\ndirectors of the bank to be the subservient instruments or silent\r\nspectators of its abuses and corruptions, nor can I ask honorable men to\r\nundertake the thankless duty with the certain prospect of being rebuked\r\nby the Senate for its faithful performance in pursuance of the lawful\r\ndirections of the Executive.\r\n\r\nI repeat that I do not claim a right to inquire into or officially\r\nto censure the acts of the Senate, but the situation in which the\r\nimportant interests of the American people vested in the Bank of the\r\nUnited States and affected by its arrangements must necessarily be left\r\nby the rejection of the gentlemen now renominated has made it my duty\r\nto give this explanation to the Senate and submit the matter to their\r\nreconsideration. If it shall be determined by the Senate that all\r\nchannels of information in relation to the corrupt proceedings of this\r\ndangerous corporation shall be cut off and the Government and country\r\nleft exposed to its unrestrained machinations against the purity of the\r\npress and public liberty, I shall, after having made this effort to\r\navert so great an evil, rest for the justification of my official course\r\nwith respectful confidence on the judgment of the American people.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it is proper I should inform the Senate that there is now\r\nno Government director appointed for the present year, Mr. Bayard, who\r\nwas nominated, and confirmed by the Senate, having refused to accept\r\nthat appointment.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 14, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, accompanied by\r\na copy of a letter from the commissioners appointed to adjust the claims\r\nof our citizens under the late treaty with Naples, and suggest for the\r\nconsideration of Congress the expediency of extending the term allowed\r\nfor the performance of the duties assigned to them.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 20, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate a report[5] from the Secretary of\r\nState, with the documents accompanying it, in pursuance of their\r\nresolution of the 7th instant, relative to the ship _Olive Branch_.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Transmitting memorial of the heir at law of General Ira\r\nAllen, relative to the capture, detention, and condemnation of the ship\r\n_Olive Branch_ and her cargo by the British Government; also copy of\r\ninstructions given to the United States minister to Great Britain and of\r\ncorrespondence between him and the British Government on the subject.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 22, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report[6] from the Secretary\r\nof State, upon the subject of a resolution of the 10th instant, which\r\nwas referred to that officer.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Transmitting correspondence and papers relating to the\r\nclaim of Don Juan Madrazo, a Spanish subject, for losses occasioned\r\nby acts of the United States and Georgia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 1, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit for the consideration of Congress a report from the Secretary\r\nof State, and recommend that legislative measures may be taken to\r\nprevent the counterfeiting of foreign coins and the exporting of\r\ncounterfeit coins from the United States.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 2, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress a communication from the governor of New York and\r\na copy of a communication from the governor of New Jersey, addressed to\r\nme with a view of obtaining the consent of Congress to an agreement\r\nwhich has been entered into by the States of New York and New Jersey\r\nto settle the boundary line between those States.

Extracts from the dispatches of\r\nMr. Livingston to the Secretary of State respecting the same subject are\r\nalso sent.\r\n\r\nI likewise transmit, for the consideration of the House, a petition\r\nfrom the heirs of the Baron de Kalb, accompanied by a note from General\r\nLafayette, praying remuneration for the services rendered by the Baron\r\nto the United States during the War of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY 21, 1834.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI nominate Arthur St. Clair to be register of the land office for the\r\ndistrict of lands subject to sale at Indianapolis, in the State of\r\nIndiana, in the place of William B. Slaughter, appointed during the\r\nrecess of the Senate.\r\n\r\nAs Arthur St. Clair was heretofore appointed to this office and was\r\nremoved during the recess, it is proper to state the reasons which\r\ninduce me again to nominate him to the Senate.\r\n\r\nDuring the last summer an agent was appointed by the Treasury\r\nDepartment to examine the land offices in Indiana, and upon his report\r\nto the Department of the proceedings in the register's and receiver's\r\noffices at Indianapolis I deemed it proper to remove both of those\r\nofficers without delay. A subsequent examination by a different agent\r\nenabled the parties to offer explanations of the charges against them\r\nin the first report, and although I am satisfied that the duty of the\r\nfirst agent was honestly and faithfully performed by him, yet the\r\ncircumstances on which his report is founded have since been so\r\nexplained as to acquit both of the officers who were removed of any\r\nintentional misconduct. In the case of Mr. St. Clair, however, it\r\nappears from both of the reports that he had permitted the clerk in his\r\noffice to be the agent of speculations in land scrip contrary to the\r\ninstructions received by him from the Treasury Department, but I am\r\nconvinced that he himself did not participate in the speculation nor\r\nshare in the profits, and that he gave the permission under a mistaken\r\nconstruction of the order and erroneous views of his duty as an officer.\r\nHis mistake in this respect seems to have arisen in a great measure\r\nfrom his reliance on the judgment of others in whom he might well have\r\nsupposed he could confide, and who appear to have sanctioned the course\r\nhe adopted without sufficiently examining the subject and the evils to\r\nwhich such a practice would necessarily lead. Under these circumstances\r\nI have believed it to be an act of justice to Mr. St. Clair to present\r\nhis name again to the Senate, as he can be reinstated in the office from\r\nwhich he was removed without injury to the person who in the recess was\r\nselected to succeed him. And I should have adopted the same course in\r\nrelation to the receiver but for the peculiar circumstances in which his\r\nsuccessor has been placed, and which would render it an act of injustice\r\nto him not to submit his name to the Senate for confirmation.\r\n\r\nThe reports and papers in relation to these removals are herewith\r\ntransmitted to the Senate, in order that they may act in the case with\r\nthe whole evidence before them.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 21, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the House of Representatives a copy of a \"convention for\r\nthe settlement of claims between the United States of America and Her\r\nCatholic Majesty,\" concluded on the 17th of February last.\r\n\r\nThis convention has been ratified by me, agreeably to the Constitution,\r\nand will be immediately transmitted to Madrid, where it will doubtless\r\nbe ratified by Her Majesty.\r\n\r\nIt is deemed proper to communicate the convention thus early, that\r\nprovision may be made for carrying the first article into effect as soon\r\nas the ratifications shall have been exchanged, in order that our\r\ncitizens may with as little delay as possible obtain the stipulated\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 28, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for their advice and consent as\r\nto the ratification of the same, a treaty and a supplement thereto,\r\nconcluded between John H. Eaton, a commissioner on the part of the\r\nUnited States, and a delegation from the Chickasaw tribe of Indians,\r\ntogether with the journal of proceedings.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 30, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIt having been represented to me by persons whose statements and\r\nopinions were thought worthy of confidence that the trade of the United\r\nStates might be extended and rendered more lucrative by commercial\r\narrangements with the countries bordering on the Indian Ocean, and\r\nbeing informed that the success of any efforts which might be made to\r\naccomplish that object would materially depend upon the secrecy with\r\nwhich they should be conducted, I appointed Mr. Edmund Roberts a special\r\nagent of this Government for the purpose of visiting those seas and\r\nconcluding such commercial conventions as might have the effect of\r\nsecuring additional advantages to our trade in that quarter. This agency\r\nhas resulted in the conclusion of treaties with the King of Siam and\r\nthe Sultan of Muscat, whereby the commerce of the United States with\r\nthe countries subject to the dominion of those princes, which had been\r\npreviously embarrassed by serious disadvantages and obstructions, is\r\nplaced upon a footing with that of the most favored nation. These\r\ntreaties, the former of which was signed at the city of Siayuthia\r\n(commonly called Bankok) on the 20th day of March, 1833, and the latter\r\nat the city of Muscat on the 21st day of September of the same year,\r\nare submitted to the Senate for their consideration and advice.\r\n\r\nI transmit a copy of the instructions which were given to the special\r\nagent and a communication made by him to the Secretary of State,\r\ncontaining particular and important information respecting the countries\r\nwith which these treaties have been concluded. The expenses of the\r\nagency have been defrayed out of the contingent fund for foreign\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 13, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI have this day received a resolution of the 12th instant, requesting me\r\nto communicate to the Senate a copy of the first official communication\r\nwhich was made to Andrew Stevenson of the intention of the President to\r\nnominate him as a minister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary to\r\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and his answer thereto.\r\n\r\nAs a compliance with this resolution might be deemed an admission of\r\nthe right of the Senate to call upon the President for confidential\r\ncorrespondence of this description, I consider it proper on this\r\noccasion to remark that I do not acknowledge such a right. But to avoid\r\nmisrepresentation I herewith transmit a copy of the paper in question,\r\nwhich was the only communication made to Mr. Stevenson on the subject.\r\n\r\nThis communication merely intimated the intention of the President in a\r\nparticular contingency to offer to Mr. Stevenson the place of minister\r\nto the Court of St. James, and as the negotiations to which it refers\r\nwere commenced early in April, 1833, in this city instead of London, and\r\nhave been since conducted here, no further communication was made to\r\nhim. I have no knowledge that an answer was received from Mr. Stevenson;\r\nnone is to be found in the Department of State and none has been\r\nreceived by me.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 18, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress an extract of a dispatch from Mr. Livingston, the\r\nminister of the United States at Paris, dated the 7th ultimo, and the\r\ncopy of a communication made to him by Captain Ballard, commander of the\r\nfrigate _United States_, by which it appears that in firing a national\r\nsalute from that ship at Toulon, in honor of the birthday of the King\r\nof the French, two men were killed and four others wounded on board the\r\nFrench ship of war _Suffren_. Suitable explanations were immediately\r\nmade to the French admiral; and the officers and crew of the American\r\nfrigate, with that generosity which distinguishes their profession,\r\npromptly contributed, by a liberal subscription, toward providing for\r\nthe families of the unfortunate sufferers. I am sure, however, that I\r\nshould not do justice to the feelings of the American people on this\r\noccasion if I did not invite Congress to assume, on their part, this\r\nmelancholy duty. I propose, therefore, that the same provision be made\r\nby law for these French seamen and their families as would be made for\r\nAmerican seamen killed or wounded in battle. This proceeding will show\r\nthe deep sensibility with which the disastrous accident is viewed by the\r\nUnited States, and their readiness to alleviate those consequences which\r\ncan not be remedied.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 20, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives, for their consideration, a\r\nmemorial from the granddaughters of the Count de Rochambeau, together\r\nwith their letter to the minister of the United States in France, from\r\nwhom these papers have been recently received.\r\n\r\nTranslations of these documents accompany them.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 21, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe afflicting intelligence of the death of the illustrious Lafayette\r\nhas been received by me this morning.\r\n\r\nI have issued the general order inclosed[7] to cause appropriate honors\r\nto be paid by the Army and Navy to the memory of one so highly venerated\r\nand beloved by my countrymen, and whom Providence has been pleased to\r\nremove so unexpectedly from the agitating scenes of life.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: See under Executive Orders, pp. 94-95.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE 23, 1834.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit for the consideration and action of the Senate a treaty\r\nconcluded with the Cherokees for the cession of their lands east of the\r\nMississippi River.\r\n\r\nIt is known to the Senate that for some years great difficulties have\r\nbeen experienced in the relations of that tribe. Without further\r\nallusion to these than as they furnish strong inducements to a final\r\nsettlement of all the questions involved in our intercourse with these\r\nIndians, it is obvious from the existing state of things that they\r\ncan not continue in their present position with any hope of ultimate\r\nprosperity. I have been, therefore, desirous that a just and\r\nsatisfactory arrangement should be made for their removal, and\r\npropositions to that effect upon a liberal scale have been repeatedly\r\nmade to them. These have until now been rejected, and their rejection,\r\nI have been induced to believe, has been owing more to the ascendency\r\nacquired by individuals who are unwilling to go than to the deliberative\r\nopinion of a majority of the Cherokee people. Some years since a form\r\nof government was established among them, but since the extension of\r\nthe laws of Georgia and Alabama over them this government can have no\r\nbinding effect upon a great majority of them. Its obligation is also\r\ndenied by many of them in consequence of the continuance of certain\r\npersons in power contrary to the principles of their fundamental\r\narticles of association. A delegation from the persons claiming to hold\r\ntheir authority under the former existing state of things is in this\r\ncity, and have communicated with the War Department on the subject of\r\ntheir situation and removal. They deny the right of the persons who have\r\nnegotiated this treaty to perform such an act, and have remonstrated\r\nagainst it. Copies of their communications are herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nThe delegation who have signed the present treaty have produced an\r\nauthority from William Hicks, designating himself as principal chief,\r\nand others, signing the same in an official capacity. It is understood\r\nfrom the report of Major Currie, the enrolling agent, that public\r\nnotice was given to all persons desirous of emigrating to attend\r\nupon a particular day and place in order to appoint representatives\r\nto communicate with the Government and to arrange the terms of cession\r\nand removal. In conformity with this notice a meeting was held and the\r\nauthority herein referred to was the result.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this application John H. Eaton was appointed to meet\r\nand confer with them and to report their views to the War Department.\r\nThese are embodied in the treaty which is presented to your\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I submit the matter to the decision of the\r\nSenate. The practice of the Government has not been very strict on the\r\nsubject of the authority of the persons negotiating treaties on the part\r\nof the Indians. Sometimes it has been done by persons representing the\r\ntribe and sometimes by the individuals composing it. I am not aware that\r\na case similar in its features to the present has ever before required\r\nthe action of the Government. But, independently of the considerations\r\nwhich so forcibly urge a settlement of this matter, no injustice can be\r\ndone to the Indians by the ratification of this treaty. It is expressly\r\nprovided that it will not be binding upon them till a majority has\r\nassented to its stipulations. When that assent is given no one can\r\njustly deny its obligation.\r\n\r\nThe Cherokees east of the Mississippi occupy a portion of the\r\nterritories of four States, to wit, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee,\r\nand Alabama. The treaty provides that the communities inhabiting\r\nthose divisions shall each be considered as acting for themselves\r\nindependently of the others. We have frequently in our intercourse\r\nwith the Indians treated with different portions of the same tribe as\r\nseparate communities. Nor is there any injustice in this as long as they\r\nare separated into divisions without any very strong bond of union, and\r\nfrequently with different interests and views. By requiring the assent\r\nof a majority to any act which will bind them we insure the preservation\r\nof a principle which will afford adequate security to their rights.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGE.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Pocket veto.]\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 4, 1833.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last session of Congress I received from that body\r\na bill entitled \"An act to appropriate for a limited time the proceeds\r\nof the sales of the public lands of the United States and for granting\r\nlands to certain States.\" The brief period then remaining before\r\nthe rising of Congress and the extreme pressure of official duties\r\nunavoidable on such occasions did not leave me sufficient time for that\r\nfull consideration of the subject which was due to its great importance.\r\nSubsequent consideration and reflection have, however, confirmed the\r\nobjections to the bill which presented themselves to my mind upon its\r\nfirst perusal, and have satisfied me that it ought not to become a law.\r\nI felt myself, therefore, constrained to withhold from it my approval,\r\nand now return it to the Senate, in which it originated, with the\r\nreasons on which my dissent is founded.\r\n\r\nI am fully sensible of the importance, as it respects both the harmony\r\nand union of the States, of making, as soon as circumstances will allow\r\nof it, a proper and final disposition of the whole subject of the public\r\nlands, and any measure for that object providing for the reimbursement\r\nto the United States of those expenses with which they are justly\r\nchargeable that may be consistent with my views of the Constitution,\r\nsound policy, and the rights of the respective States will readily\r\nreceive my cooperation. This bill, however, is not of that character.\r\nThe arrangement it contemplates is not permanent, but limited to five\r\nyears only, and in its terms appears to anticipate alterations within\r\nthat time, at the discretion of Congress; and it furnishes no adequate\r\nsecurity against those continued agitations of the subject which it\r\nshould be the principal object of any measure for the disposition of\r\nthe public lands to avert.\r\n\r\nNeither the merits of the bill under consideration nor the validity of\r\nthe objections which I have felt it to be my duty to make to its passage\r\ncan be correctly appreciated without a full understanding of the manner\r\nin which the public lands upon which it is intended to operate were\r\nacquired and the conditions upon which they are now held by the United\r\nStates. I will therefore precede the statement of those objections by a\r\nbrief but distinct exposition of these points.\r\n\r\nThe waste lands within the United States constituted one of the early\r\nobstacles to the organization of any government for the protection of\r\ntheir common interests. In October, 1777, while Congress were framing\r\nthe Articles of Confederation, a proposition was made to amend them to\r\nthe following effect, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\n  That the United States in Congress assembled shall have the sole and\r\n  exclusive right and power to ascertain and fix the western boundary of\r\n  such States as claim to the Mississippi or South Sea, and lay out the\r\n  land beyond the boundary so ascertained into separate and independent\r\n  States from time to time as the numbers and circumstances of the people\r\n  thereof may require.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was, however, rejected, Maryland only voting for it, and so difficult\r\ndid the subject appear that the patriots of that body agreed to waive it\r\nin the Articles of Confederation and leave it for future settlement.\r\n\r\nOn the submission of the Articles to the several State legislatures for\r\nratification the most formidable objection was found to be in this\r\nsubject of the waste lands. Maryland, Rhode Island, and New Jersey\r\ninstructed their delegates in Congress to move amendments to them\r\nproviding that the waste or Crown lands should be considered the common\r\nproperty of the United States, but they were rejected. All the States\r\nexcept Maryland acceded to the Articles, notwithstanding some of them\r\ndid so with the reservation that their claim to those lands as common\r\nproperty was not thereby abandoned.\r\n\r\nOn the sole ground that no declaration to that effect was contained in\r\nthe Articles, Maryland withheld her assent, and in May, 1779, embodied\r\nher objections in the form of instructions to her delegates, which were\r\nentered upon the Journals of Congress. The following extracts are from\r\nthat document, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Is it possible that those States who are ambitiously grasping at\r\n  territories to which in our judgment they have not the least shadow of\r\n  exclusive right will use with greater moderation the increase of wealth\r\n  and power derived from those territories when acquired than what they\r\n  have displayed in their endeavors to acquire them? ...\r\n\r\n  We are convinced policy and justice require that a country unsettled at\r\n  the commencement of this war, claimed by the British Crown and ceded to\r\n  it by the treaty of Paris, if wrested from the common enemy by the blood\r\n  and treasure of the thirteen States, should be considered as a common\r\n  property, subject to be parceled out by Congress into free, convenient,\r\n  and independent governments, in such manner and at such times as the\r\n  wisdom of that assembly shall hereafter direct. ...\r\n\r\n\r\nVirginia proceeded to open a land office for the sale of her Western\r\nlands, which produced such excitement as to induce Congress, in October,\r\n1779, to interpose and earnestly recommend to \"the said State and all\r\nStates similarly circumstanced to forbear settling or issuing warrants\r\nfor such unappropriated lands, or granting the same, during the\r\ncontinuance of the present war.\"\r\n\r\nIn March, 1780, the legislature of New York passed an act tendering a\r\ncession to the United States of the claims of that State to the Western\r\nterritory, preceded by a preamble to the following effect, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Whereas nothing under Divine Providence can more effectually contribute\r\n  to the tranquillity and safety of the United States of America than a\r\n  federal alliance on such liberal principles as will give satisfaction to\r\n  its respective members; and whereas the Articles of Confederation and\r\n  Perpetual Union recommended by the honorable Congress of the United\r\n  States of America have not proved acceptable to all the States, it\r\n  having been conceived that a portion of the waste and uncultivated\r\n  territory within the limits or claims of certain States ought to be\r\n  appropriated as a common fund for the expenses of the war, and the\r\n  people of the State of New York being on all occasions disposed to\r\n  manifest their regard for their sister States and their earnest desire\r\n  to promote the general interest and security, and more especially to\r\n  accelerate the federal alliance, by removing as far as it depends upon\r\n  them the before-mentioned impediment to its final accomplishment. ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThis act of New York, the instructions of Maryland, and a remonstrance\r\nof Virginia were referred to a committee of Congress, who reported a\r\npreamble and resolutions thereon, which were adopted on the 6th\r\nSeptember, 1780; so much of which as is necessary to elucidate the\r\nsubject is to the following effect, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\n  That it appears advisable to press upon those States which can remove\r\n  the embarrassments respecting the Western country a liberal surrender of\r\n  a portion of their territorial claims, since they can not be preserved\r\n  entire without endangering the stability of the General Confederacy; to\r\n  remind them how indispensably necessary it is to establish the Federal\r\n  Union on a fixed and permanent basis and on principles acceptable to all\r\n  its respective members; how essential to public credit and confidence,\r\n  to the support of our Army, to the vigor of our counsels and success of\r\n  our measures, to our tranquillity at home, our reputation abroad, to our\r\n  very existence as a free, sovereign, and independent people; that they\r\n  are fully persuaded the wisdom of the several legislatures will lead\r\n  them to a full and impartial consideration of a subject so interesting\r\n  to the United States, and so necessary to the happy establishment of the\r\n  Federal Union; that they are confirmed in these expectations by a review\r\n  of the before-mentioned act of the legislature of New York, submitted to\r\n  their consideration. ...\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That copies of the several papers referred to the committee\r\n  be transmitted, with a copy of the report, to the legislatures of the\r\n  several States, and that it be earnestly recommended to those States who\r\n  have claims to the Western country to pass such laws and give their\r\n  delegates in Congress such powers as may effectually remove the only\r\n  obstacle to a final ratification of the Articles of Confederation, and\r\n  that the legislature of Maryland be earnestly requested to authorize\r\n  their delegates in Congress to subscribe the said Articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing up this policy, Congress proceeded, on the 10th October, 1780,\r\nto pass a resolution pledging the United States to the several States as\r\nto the manner in which any lands that might be ceded by them should be\r\ndisposed of, the material parts of which are as follows, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the unappropriated lands which may be ceded or\r\n  relinquished to the United States by any particular State pursuant to\r\n  the recommendation of Congress of the 6th day of September last shall be\r\n  disposed of for the common benefit of the United States and be settled\r\n  and formed into distinct republican States, which shall become members\r\n  of the Federal Union and have the same rights of sovereignty, freedom,\r\n  and independence as the other States; ... that the said lands shall be\r\n  granted or settled at such times and under such regulations as shall\r\n  hereafter be agreed on by the United States in Congress assembled, or\r\n  nine or more of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February, 1781, the legislature of Maryland passed an act authorizing\r\ntheir delegates in Congress to sign the Articles of Confederation. The\r\nfollowing are extracts from the preamble and body of the act, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Whereas it hath been said that the common enemy is encouraged by this\r\n  State not acceding to the Confederation to hope that the union of the\r\n  sister States may be dissolved, and therefore prosecutes the war in\r\n  expectation of an event so disgraceful to America, and our friends and\r\n  illustrious ally are impressed with an idea that the common cause would\r\n  be promoted by our formally acceding to the Confederation. ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe act of which this is the preamble authorizes the delegates of that\r\nState to sign the Articles, and proceeds to declare \"that by acceding\r\nto the said Confederation this State doth not relinquish, nor intend\r\nto relinquish, any right or interest she hath with the other united or\r\nconfederated States to the back country,\" etc.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of March, 1781, the delegates of Maryland signed the Articles\r\nof Confederation, and the Federal Union under that compact was complete.\r\nThe conflicting claims to the Western lands, however, were not disposed\r\nof, and continued to give great trouble to Congress. Repeated and urgent\r\ncalls were made by Congress upon the States claiming them to make\r\nliberal cessions to the United States, and it was not until long after\r\nthe present Constitution was formed that the grants were completed.\r\n\r\nThe deed of cession from New York was executed on the 1st of March,\r\n1781, the day the Articles of Confederation were ratified, and it was\r\naccepted by Congress on the 29th October, 1782. One of the conditions of\r\nthis cession thus tendered and accepted was that the lands ceded to the\r\nUnited States \"_shall be and inure for the use and benefit of such of\r\nthe United States as shall become members of the federal alliance of\r\nthe said States, and for no other use or purpose whatsoever_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Virginia deed of cession was executed and accepted on the 1st day of\r\nMarch, 1784. One of the conditions of this cession is as follows, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\n  That all the lands within the territory as ceded to the United States,\r\n  and not reserved for or appropriated to any of the before-mentioned\r\n  purposes or disposed of in bounties to the officers and soldiers of the\r\n  American Army, _shall be considered as a common fund for the use and\r\n  benefit of such of the United States as have become or shall become\r\n  members of the confederation or federal alliance of the said States,\r\n  Virginia inclusive, according to their usual respective proportions in\r\n  the general charge and expenditure, and shall be faithfully and bona\r\n  fide disposed of for that purpose, and for no other use or purpose\r\n  whatsoever_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the years 1785, 1786, and 1787 Massachusetts, Connecticut, and\r\nSouth Carolina ceded their claims upon similar conditions. The Federal\r\nGovernment went into operation under the existing Constitution on\r\nthe 4th of March, 1789. The following is the only provision of that\r\nConstitution which has a direct bearing on the subject of the public\r\nlands, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules\r\n  and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging\r\n  to the United States, and nothing in this Constitution shall be so\r\n  construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States or of any\r\n  particular State.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the Constitution left all the compacts before made in full force,\r\nand the rights of all parties remained the same under the new Government\r\nas they were under the Confederation.\r\n\r\nThe deed of cession of North Carolina was executed in December, 1789,\r\nand accepted by an act of Congress approved April 2, 1790. The third\r\ncondition of this cession was in the following words, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\n  That all the lands intended to be ceded by virtue of this act to the\r\n  United States of America, and not appropriated as before mentioned,\r\n  _shall be considered as a common fund for the use and benefit of the\r\n  United States of America, North Carolina inclusive, according to their\r\n  respective and usual proportions of the general charge and expenditure,\r\n  and shall be faithfully disposed of for that purpose, and for no other\r\n  use or purpose whatever_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cession of Georgia was completed on the 16th June, 1802, and in its\r\nleading condition is precisely like that of Virginia and North Carolina.\r\nThis grant completed the title of the United States to all those lands\r\ngenerally called _public lands_ lying within the original limits of the\r\nConfederacy. Those which have been acquired by the purchase of Louisiana\r\nand Florida, having been paid for out of the common treasure of the\r\nUnited States, are as much the property of the General Government, to\r\nbe disposed of for the common benefit, as those ceded by the several\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBy the facts here collected from the early history of our Republic it\r\nappears that the subject of the public lands entered into the elements\r\nof its institutions. It was only upon the condition that those lands\r\nshould be considered as common property, to be disposed of for the\r\nbenefit of the United States, that some of the States agreed to come\r\ninto a \"perpetual union.\" The States claiming those lands acceded to\r\nthose views and transferred their claims to the United States upon\r\ncertain specific conditions, and on those conditions the grants were\r\naccepted. These solemn compacts, invited by Congress in a resolution\r\ndeclaring the purposes to which the proceeds of these lands should be\r\napplied, originating before the Constitution and forming the basis on\r\nwhich it was made, bound the United States to a particular course of\r\npolicy in relation to them by ties as strong as can be invented to\r\nsecure the faith of nations.\r\n\r\nAs early as May, 1785, Congress, in execution of these compacts, passed\r\nan ordinance providing for the sales of lands in the Western territory\r\nand directing the proceeds to be paid into the Treasury of the United\r\nStates. With the same object other ordinances were adopted prior to the\r\norganization of the present Government.\r\n\r\nIn further execution of these compacts the Congress of the United States\r\nunder the present Constitution, as early as the 4th of August, 1790, in\r\n\"An act making provision for the debt of the United States,\" enacted as\r\nfollows, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\n  That the proceeds of sales which shall be made of lands in the\r\n  Western territory now belonging or that may hereafter belong to the\r\n  United States shall be and are hereby appropriated toward sinking or\r\n  discharging the debts for the payment whereof the United States now\r\n  are or by virtue of this act may be holden, and shall be applied solely\r\n  to that use until the said debt shall be fully satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo secure to the Government of the United States forever the power to\r\nexecute these compacts in good faith the Congress of the Confederation,\r\nas early as July 13, 1787, in an ordinance for the government of the\r\nterritory of the United States northwest of the river Ohio, prescribed\r\nto the people inhabiting the Western territory certain conditions which\r\nwere declared to be \"articles of compact between the original States and\r\nthe people and States in the said territory,\" which should \"forever\r\nremain unalterable, unless by common consent.\" In one of these articles\r\nit is declared that--\r\n\r\n\r\n  The legislatures of those districts, or new States, shall never\r\n  interfere with the primary disposal of the soil by the United States in\r\n  Congress assembled, nor with any regulations Congress may find necessary\r\n  for securing the title in such soil to the _bona fide purchasers_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis condition has been exacted from the people of all the new\r\nterritories, and to put its obligation beyond dispute each new State\r\ncarved out of the public domain has been required explicitly to\r\nrecognize it as one of the conditions of admission into the Union. Some\r\nof them have declared through their conventions in separate acts that\r\ntheir people \"forever disclaim all right and title to the waste and\r\nunappropriated lands lying within this State, and that the same shall\r\nbe and remain at the sole and entire disposition of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nWith such care have the United States reserved to themselves, in all\r\ntheir acts down to this day, in legislating for the Territories and\r\nadmitting States into the Union, the unshackled power to execute in good\r\nfaith the compacts of cession made with the original States. From these\r\nfacts and proceedings it plainly and certainly results--\r\n\r\n1. That one of the fundamental principles on which the Confederation of\r\nthe United States was originally based was that the waste lands of the\r\nWest within their limits should be the common property of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n2. That those lands were ceded to the United States by the States which\r\nclaimed them, and the cessions were accepted on the express condition\r\nthat they should be disposed of for the common benefit of the States,\r\naccording to their respective proportions in the general charge and\r\nexpenditure, and for no other purpose whatsoever.\r\n\r\n3. That in execution of these solemn compacts the Congress of the United\r\nStates did, under the Confederation, proceed to sell these lands and put\r\nthe avails into the common Treasury, and under the new Constitution did\r\nrepeatedly pledge them for the payment of the public debt of the United\r\nStates, by which pledge each State was expected to profit in proportion\r\nto the general charge to be made upon it for that object.\r\n\r\nThese are the first principles of this whole subject, which I think\r\ncan not be contested by anyone who examines the proceedings of the\r\nRevolutionary Congress, the cessions of the several States, and the acts\r\nof Congress under the new Constitution. Keeping them deeply impressed\r\nupon the mind, let us proceed to examine how far the objects of the\r\ncessions have been completed, and see whether those compacts are not\r\nstill obligatory upon the United States.\r\n\r\nThe debt for which these lands were pledged by Congress may be\r\nconsidered as paid, and they are consequently released from that lien.\r\nBut that pledge formed no part of the compacts with the States, or of\r\nthe conditions upon which the cessions were made. It was a contract\r\nbetween new parties--between the United States and their creditors.\r\nUpon payment of the debt the compacts remain in full force, and the\r\nobligation of the United States to dispose of the lands for the common\r\nbenefit is neither destroyed nor impaired. As they can not now be\r\nexecuted in that mode, the only legitimate question which can arise is,\r\nIn what other way are these lands to be hereafter disposed of for the\r\ncommon benefit of the several States, \"_according to their respective\r\nand usual proportion in the general charge and expenditure?_\" The\r\ncessions of Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia in express terms,\r\nand all the rest impliedly, not only provide thus specifically the\r\nproportion according to which each State shall profit by the proceeds\r\nof the land sales, but they proceed to declare that they shall be\r\n\"_faithfully and bona fide disposed of for that purpose, and for no\r\nother use or purpose whatsoever_.\" This is the fundamental law of the\r\nland at this moment, growing out of compacts which are older than the\r\nConstitution, and formed the corner stone on which the Union itself\r\nwas erected.\r\n\r\nIn the practice of the Government the proceeds of the public lands have\r\nnot been set apart _as a separate fund_ for the payment of the public\r\ndebt, but have been and are now paid into the Treasury, where they\r\nconstitute a part of the aggregate of revenue upon which the Government\r\ndraws as well for its current expenditures as for payment of the public\r\ndebt. In this manner they have heretofore and do now lessen the general\r\ncharge upon the people of the several States in the exact proportions\r\nstipulated in the compacts.\r\n\r\nThese general charges have been composed not only of the public debt and\r\nthe usual expenditures attending the civil and military administrations\r\nof the Government, but of the amounts paid to the States with which\r\nthese compacts were formed, the amounts paid the Indians for their\r\nright of possession, the amounts paid for the purchase of Louisiana and\r\nFlorida, and the amounts paid surveyors, registers, receivers, clerks,\r\netc., employed in preparing for market and selling the Western domain.\r\n\r\nFrom the origin of the land system down to the 30th September, 1832, the\r\namount expended for all these purposes has been about $49,701,280, and\r\nthe amount received from the sales, deducting payments on account of\r\nroads, etc., about $38,386,624. The revenue arising from the public\r\nlands, therefore, has not been sufficient to meet the general charges\r\non the Treasury which have grown out of them by about $11,314,656. Yet\r\nin having been applied to lessen those charges the conditions of the\r\ncompacts have been thus far fulfilled, and each State has profited\r\naccording to its usual proportion in the general charge and expenditure.\r\nThe annual proceeds of land sales have increased and the charges have\r\ndiminished, so that at a reduced price those lands would now defray all\r\ncurrent charges growing out of them and save the Treasury from further\r\nadvances on their account. Their original intent and object, therefore,\r\nwould be accomplished as fully as it has hitherto been by reducing the\r\nprice and hereafter, as heretofore, bringing the proceeds into the\r\nTreasury. Indeed, as this is the only mode in which the objects of the\r\noriginal compact can be attained, it may be considered for all practical\r\npurposes that it is one of their requirements.\r\n\r\nThe bill before me begins with an entire subversion of every one of the\r\ncompacts by which the United States became possessed of their Western\r\ndomain, and treats the subject as if they never had existence and as if\r\nthe United States were the original and unconditional owners of all the\r\npublic lands. The first section directs--\r\n\r\n\r\n  That from and after the 31st day of December, 1832, there shall be\r\n  allowed and paid to each of the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\r\n  Alabama, Missouri, Mississippi, and Louisiana, over and above what each\r\n  of the said States is entitled to by the terms of the compacts entered\r\n  into between them respectively upon their admission into the Union and\r\n  the United States, the sum of 12-1/2 per cent upon the net amount of the\r\n  sales of the public lands which subsequent to the day aforesaid shall be\r\n  made within the several limits of the said States, which said sum of\r\n  12-1/2 per cent shall be applied to some object or objects of internal\r\n  improvement or education within the said States under the direction of\r\n  their several legislatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis 12-1/2 per cent is to be taken out of the net proceeds of the land\r\nsales before any apportionment is made, and the same seven States which\r\nare first to receive this proportion are also to receive their due\r\nproportion of the residue according to the ratio of general\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nNow, waiving all considerations of equity or policy in regard to this\r\nprovision, what more need be said to demonstrate its objectionable\r\ncharacter than that it is in direct and undisguised violation of the\r\npledge given by Congress to the States before a single cession was made,\r\nthat it abrogates the condition upon which some of the States came into\r\nthe Union, and that it sets at naught the terms of cession spread upon\r\nthe face of every grant under which the title to that portion of the\r\npublic land is held by the Federal Government?\r\n\r\nIn the apportionment of the remaining seven-eighths of the proceeds this\r\nbill, in a manner equally undisguised, violates the conditions upon\r\nwhich the United States acquired title to the ceded lands. Abandoning\r\naltogether the ratio of distribution according to the general charge and\r\nexpenditure provided by the compacts, it adopts that of the Federal\r\nrepresentative population. Virginia and other States which ceded their\r\nlands upon the express condition that they should receive a benefit from\r\ntheir sales in proportion to their part of the general charge are by the\r\nbill allowed only a portion of seven-eighths of their proceeds, and that\r\nnot in the proportion of general charge and expenditure, but in the\r\nratio of their Federal representative population.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States did not delegate to Congress the\r\npower to abrogate these compacts. On the contrary, by declaring that\r\nnothing in it \"_shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the\r\nUnited States or of any particular State_,\" it virtually provides that\r\nthese compacts and the rights they secure shall remain untouched by\r\nthe legislative power, which shall only make all \"_needful rules and\r\nregulations_\" for carrying them into effect. All beyond this would seem\r\nto be an assumption of undelegated power.\r\n\r\nThese ancient compacts are invaluable monuments of an age of virtue,\r\npatriotism, and disinterestedness. They exhibit the price that great\r\nStates which had won liberty were willing to pay for that union without\r\nwhich they plainly saw it could not be preserved. It was not for\r\nterritory or state power that our Revolutionary fathers took up arms;\r\nit was for individual liberty and the right of self-government. The\r\nexpulsion from the continent of British armies and British power was to\r\nthem a barren conquest if through the collisions of the redeemed States\r\nthe individual rights for which they fought should become the prey of\r\npetty military tyrannies established at home. To avert such consequences\r\nand throw around liberty the shield of union, States whose relative\r\nstrength at the time gave them a preponderating power magnanimously\r\nsacrificed domains which would have made them the rivals of empires,\r\nonly stipulating that they should be disposed of for the common benefit\r\nof themselves and the other confederated States. This enlightened policy\r\nproduced union and has secured liberty. It has made our waste lands\r\nto swarm with a busy people and added many powerful States to our\r\nConfederation. As well for the fruits which these noble works of our\r\nancestors have produced as for the devotedness in which they originated,\r\nwe should hesitate before we demolish them.\r\n\r\nBut there are other principles asserted in the bill which would have\r\nimpelled me to withhold my signature had I not seen in it a violation\r\nof the compacts by which the United States acquired title to a large\r\nportion of the public lands. It reasserts the principle contained in\r\nthe bill authorizing a subscription to the stock of the Maysville,\r\nWashington, Paris and Lexington Turnpike Road Company, from which I was\r\ncompelled to withhold my consent for reasons contained in my message of\r\nthe 27th May, 1830, to the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe leading principle then asserted was that Congress possesses no\r\nconstitutional power to appropriate any part of the moneys of the\r\nUnited States for objects of a local character within the States.\r\nThat principle I can not be mistaken in supposing has received the\r\nunequivocal sanction of the American people, and all subsequent\r\nreflection has but satisfied me more thoroughly that the interests of\r\nour people and the purity of our Government, if not its existence,\r\ndepend on its observance. The public lands are the common property of\r\nthe United States, and the moneys arising from their sales are a part of\r\nthe public revenue. This bill proposes to raise from and appropriate a\r\nportion of this public revenue to certain States, providing expressly\r\nthat it shall \"_be applied to objects of internal improvement or\r\neducation within those States_,\" and then proceeds to appropriate the\r\nbalance to all the States, with the declaration that it shall be applied\r\n\"_to such purposes as the legislatures of the said respective States\r\nshall deem proper_.\" The former appropriation is expressly for internal\r\nimprovements or education, without qualification as to the kind of\r\nimprovements, and therefore in express violation of the principle\r\nmaintained in my objections to the turnpike-road bill above referred\r\nto. The latter appropriation is more broad, and gives the money to be\r\napplied to any local purpose whatsoever. It will not be denied that\r\nunder the provisions of the bill a portion of the money might have been\r\napplied to making the very road to which the bill of 1830 had reference,\r\nand must of course come within the scope of the same principle. If the\r\nmoney of the United States can not be applied to local purposes _through\r\nits own agents_, as little can it be permitted to be thus expended\r\n_through the agency of the State governments_.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that with all the reductions in our revenue which\r\ncould be speedily effected by Congress without injury to the substantial\r\ninterests of the country there might be for some years to come a surplus\r\nof moneys in the Treasury, and that there was in principle no objection\r\nto returning them to the people by whom they were paid. As the literal\r\naccomplishment of such an object is obviously impracticable, it was\r\nthought admissible, as the nearest approximation to it, to hand them\r\nover to the State governments, the more immediate representatives of\r\nthe people, to be by them applied to the benefit of those to whom they\r\nproperly belonged. The principle and the object were to return to the\r\npeople an unavoidable surplus of revenue which might have been paid by\r\nthem under a system which could not at once be abandoned, but even this\r\nresource, which at one time seemed to be almost the only alternative to\r\nsave the General Government from grasping unlimited power over internal\r\nimprovements, was suggested with doubts of its constitutionality.\r\n\r\nBut this bill assumes a new principle. Its object is not to return to\r\nthe people an unavoidable surplus of revenue paid in by them, but to\r\ncreate a surplus for distribution among the States. It seizes the entire\r\nproceeds of one source of revenue and sets them apart as a surplus,\r\nmaking it necessary to raise the moneys for supporting the Government\r\nand meeting the general charges from other sources. It even throws the\r\nentire land system upon the customs for its support, and makes the\r\npublic lands a perpetual charge upon the Treasury. It does not return\r\nto the people moneys accidentally or unavoidably paid by them to the\r\nGovernment, by which they are not wanted, but compels the people to pay\r\nmoneys into the Treasury for the mere purpose of creating a surplus for\r\ndistribution to their State governments. If this principle be once\r\nadmitted, it is not difficult to perceive to what consequences it may\r\nlead. Already this bill, by throwing the land system on the revenues\r\nfrom imports for support, virtually distributes among the States a part\r\nof those revenues. The proportion may be increased from time to time,\r\nwithout any departure from the principle now asserted, until the State\r\ngovernments shall derive all the funds necessary for their support from\r\nthe Treasury of the United States, or, if a sufficient supply should be\r\nobtained by some States and not by others, the deficient States might\r\ncomplain; and to put an end to all further difficulty Congress, without\r\nassuming any new principle, need go but one step further and put the\r\nsalaries of all the State governors, judges, and other officers, with a\r\nsufficient sum for other expenses, in their general appropriation bill.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that a more direct road to consolidation can not be\r\ndevised. Money is power, and in that Government which pays all the\r\npublic officers of the States will all political power be substantially\r\nconcentrated. The State governments, if governments they might be\r\ncalled, would lose all their independence and dignity; the economy which\r\nnow distinguishes them would be converted into a profusion, limited\r\nonly by the extent of the supply. Being the dependents of the General\r\nGovernment, and looking to its Treasury as the source of all their\r\nemoluments, the State officers, under whatever names they might pass and\r\nby whatever forms their duties might be prescribed, would in effect be\r\nthe mere stipendiaries and instruments of the central power.\r\n\r\nI am quite sure that the intelligent people of our several States will\r\nbe satisfied on a little reflection that it is neither wise nor safe to\r\nrelease the members of their local legislatures from the responsibility\r\nof levying the taxes necessary to support their State governments and\r\nvest it in Congress, over most of whose members they have no control.\r\nThey will not think it expedient that Congress shall be the taxgatherer\r\nand paymaster of all their State governments, thus amalgamating all\r\ntheir officers into one mass of common interest and common feeling.\r\nIt is too obvious that such a course would subvert our well-balanced\r\nsystem of government, and ultimately deprive us of all the blessings\r\nnow derived from our happy Union.\r\n\r\nHowever willing I might be that any unavoidable surplus in the\r\nTreasury should be returned to the people through their State\r\ngovernments, I can not assent to the principle that a surplus may be\r\ncreated for the purpose of distribution. Viewing this bill as in effect\r\nassuming the right not only to create a surplus for that purpose, but to\r\ndivide the contents of the Treasury among the States without limitation,\r\nfrom whatever source they may be derived, and asserting the power to\r\nraise and appropriate money for the support of every State government\r\nand institution, as well as for making every local improvement, however\r\ntrivial, I can not give it my assent.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to perceive what advantages would accrue to the old\r\nStates or the new from the system of distribution which this bill\r\nproposes if it were otherwise unobjectionable. It requires no argument\r\nto prove that if $3,000,000 a year, or any other sum, shall be taken out\r\nof the Treasury by this bill for distribution it must be replaced by the\r\nsame sum collected from the people through some other means. The old\r\nStates will receive annually a sum of money from the Treasury, but they\r\nwill pay in a larger sum, together with the expenses of collection and\r\ndistribution. It is only their proportion of _seven-eighths_ of the\r\nproceeds of land sales which they are _to receive_, but they must _pay_\r\ntheir due proportion of the _whole_. Disguise it as we may, the bill\r\nproposes to them a dead loss in the ratio of _eight_ to _seven_,\r\nin addition to expenses and other incidental losses. This assertion\r\nis not the less true because it may not at first be palpable. Their\r\nreceipts will be in large sums, but their payments in small ones. The\r\n_governments_ of the States will receive _seven_ dollars, for which the\r\n_people_ of the States will pay _eight_. The large sums received will\r\nbe palpable to the senses; the small sums paid it requires thought to\r\nidentify. But a little consideration will satisfy the people that the\r\neffect is the same as if _seven hundred dollars_ were given them from\r\nthe public Treasury, for which they were at the same time required to\r\npay in taxes, direct or indirect, _eight hundred_.\r\n\r\nI deceive myself greatly if the new States would find their interests\r\npromoted by such a system as this bill proposes. Their true policy\r\nconsists in the rapid settling and improvement of the waste lands within\r\ntheir limits. As a means of hastening those events, they have long been\r\nlooking to a reduction in the price of public lands upon the final\r\npayment of the national debt. The effect of the proposed system would be\r\nto prevent that reduction. It is true the bill reserves to Congress the\r\npower to reduce the price, but the effect of its details as now arranged\r\nwould probably be forever to prevent its exercise.\r\n\r\nWith the just men who inhabit the new States it is a sufficient reason\r\nto reject this system that it is in violation of the fundamental laws\r\nof the Republic and its Constitution. But if it were a mere question of\r\ninterest or expediency they would still reject it. They would not sell\r\ntheir bright prospect of increasing wealth and growing power at such\r\na price. They would not place a sum of money to be paid into their\r\ntreasuries in competition with the settlement of their waste lands and\r\nthe increase of their population. They would not consider a small\r\nor a large annual sum to be paid to their governments and immediately\r\nexpended as an equivalent for that enduring wealth which is composed of\r\nflocks and herds and cultivated farms. No temptation will allure them\r\nfrom that object of abiding interest, the settlement of their waste\r\nlands, and the increase of a hardy race of free citizens, their glory\r\nin peace and their defense in war.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I adhere to the opinion, expressed by me in my annual\r\nmessage of 1832, that it is our true policy that the public lands shall\r\ncease as soon as practicable to be a source of revenue, except for the\r\npayment of those general charges which grow out of the acquisition of\r\nthe lands, their survey and sale. Although these expenses have not been\r\nmet by the proceeds of sales heretofore, it is quite certain they will\r\nbe hereafter, even after a considerable reduction in the price. By\r\nmeeting in the Treasury so much of the general charge as arises from\r\nthat source they will hereafter, as they have been heretofore, be\r\ndisposed of for the common benefit of the United States, according to\r\nthe compacts of cession. I do not doubt that it is the real interest\r\nof each and all the States in the Union, and particularly of the new\r\nStates, that the price of these lands shall be reduced and graduated,\r\nand that after they have been offered for a certain number of years\r\nthe refuse remaining unsold shall be abandoned to the States and the\r\nmachinery of our land system entirely withdrawn. It can not be supposed\r\nthe compacts intended that the United States should retain forever a\r\ntitle to lands within the States which are of no value, and no doubt\r\nis entertained that the general interest would be best promoted by\r\nsurrendering such lands to the States.\r\n\r\nThis plan for disposing of the public lands impairs no principle,\r\nviolates no compact, and deranges no system. Already has the price of\r\nthose lands been reduced from $2 per acre to $1.25, and upon the will of\r\nCongress it depends whether there shall be a further reduction. While\r\nthe burdens of the East are diminishing by the reduction of the duties\r\nupon imports, it seems but equal justice that the chief burden of the\r\nWest should be lightened in an equal degree at least. It would be just\r\nto the old States and the new, conciliate every interest, disarm the\r\nsubject of all its dangers, and add another guaranty to the perpetuity\r\nof our happy Union.\r\n\r\nSensible, however, of the difficulties which surround this important\r\nsubject, I can only add to my regrets at finding myself again compelled\r\nto disagree with the legislative power the sincere declaration that any\r\nplan which shall promise a final and satisfactory disposition of the\r\nquestion and be compatible with the Constitution and public faith shall\r\nhave my hearty concurrence.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[NOTE.--For reasons for the pocket veto of \"An act to improve the\r\nnavigation of the Wabash River,\" see Sixth Annual Message, dated\r\nDecember 1, 1834, pp. 118-123.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTEST.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The Senate ordered that it be not entered on the Journal.]\r\n\r\nAPRIL 15, 1834.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIt appears by the published Journal of the Senate that on the 26th of\r\nDecember last a resolution was offered by a member of the Senate, which\r\nafter a protracted debate was on the 28th day of March last modified\r\nby the mover and passed by the votes of twenty-six Senators out of\r\nforty-six who were present and voted, in the following words, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President, in the late Executive proceedings in\r\n  relation to the public revenue, has assumed upon himself authority and\r\n  power not conferred by the Constitution and laws, but in derogation of\r\n  both.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving had the honor, through the voluntary suffrages of the American\r\npeople, to fill the office of President of the United States during\r\nthe period which may be presumed to have been referred to in this\r\nresolution, it is sufficiently evident that the censure it inflicts was\r\nintended for myself. Without notice, unheard and untried, I thus find\r\nmyself charged on the records of the Senate, and in a form hitherto\r\nunknown in our history, with the high crime of violating the laws and\r\nConstitution of my country.\r\n\r\nIt can seldom be necessary for any department of the Government, when\r\nassailed in conversation or debate or by the strictures of the press or\r\nof popular assemblies, to step out of its ordinary path for the purpose\r\nof vindicating its conduct or of pointing out any irregularity or\r\ninjustice in the manner of the attack; but when the Chief Executive\r\nMagistrate is, by one of the most important branches of the Government\r\nin its official capacity, in a public manner, and by its recorded\r\nsentence, but without precedent, competent authority, or just cause,\r\ndeclared guilty of a breach of the laws and Constitution, it is due to\r\nhis station, to public opinion, and to a proper self-respect that the\r\nofficer thus denounced should promptly expose the wrong which has been\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, moreover, there is even a stronger necessity for\r\nsuch a vindication. By an express provision of the Constitution, before\r\nthe President of the United States can enter on the execution of his\r\noffice he is required to take an oath or affirmation in the following\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\r\n  I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the\r\n  office of President of the United States and will to the best of my\r\n  ability preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United\r\n  States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duty of defending so far as in him lies the integrity of the\r\nConstitution would indeed have resulted from the very nature of his\r\noffice, but by thus expressing it in the official oath or affirmation,\r\nwhich in this respect differs from that of any other functionary, the\r\nfounders of our Republic have attested their sense of its importance\r\nand have given to it a peculiar solemnity and force. Bound to the\r\nperformance of this duty by the oath I have taken, by the strongest\r\nobligations of gratitude to the American people, and by the ties which\r\nunite my every earthly interest with the welfare and glory of my\r\ncountry, and perfectly convinced that the discussion and passage of\r\nthe above-mentioned resolution were not only unauthorized by the\r\nConstitution, but in many respects repugnant to its provisions and\r\nsubversive of the rights secured by it to other coordinate departments,\r\nI deem it an imperative duty to maintain the supremacy of that sacred\r\ninstrument and the immunities of the department intrusted to my care\r\nby all means consistent with my own lawful powers, with the rights of\r\nothers, and with the genius of our civil institutions. To this end I\r\nhave caused this my _solemn protest_ against the aforesaid proceedings\r\nto be placed on the files of the executive department and to be\r\ntransmitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nIt is alike due to the subject, the Senate, and the people that the\r\nviews which I have taken of the proceedings referred to, and which\r\ncompel me to regard them in the light that has been mentioned, should\r\nbe exhibited at length, and with the freedom and firmness which are\r\nrequired by an occasion so unprecedented and peculiar.\r\n\r\nUnder the Constitution of the United States the powers and functions\r\nof the various departments of the Federal Government and their\r\nresponsibilities for violation or neglect of duty are clearly defined\r\nor result by necessary inference. The legislative power is, subject to\r\nthe qualified negative of the President, vested in the Congress of the\r\nUnited States, composed of the Senate and House of Representatives; the\r\nexecutive power is vested exclusively in the President, except that in\r\nthe conclusion of treaties and in certain appointments to office he is\r\nto act with the advice and consent of the Senate; the judicial power is\r\nvested exclusively in the Supreme and other courts of the United States,\r\nexcept in cases of impeachment, for which purpose the accusatory power\r\nis vested in the House of Representatives and that of hearing and\r\ndetermining in the Senate. But although for the special purposes which\r\nhave been mentioned there is an occasional intermixture of the powers of\r\nthe different departments, yet with these exceptions each of the three\r\ngreat departments is independent of the others in its sphere of action,\r\nand when it deviates from that sphere is not responsible to the others\r\nfurther than it is expressly made so in the Constitution. In every other\r\nrespect each of them is the coequal of the other two, and all are the\r\nservants of the American people, without power or right to control or\r\ncensure each other in the service of their common superior, save only\r\nin the manner and to the degree which that superior has prescribed.\r\n\r\nThe responsibilities of the President are numerous and weighty.\r\nHe is liable to impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors, and on\r\ndue conviction to removal from office and perpetual disqualification;\r\nand notwithstanding such conviction, he may also be indicted and\r\npunished according to law. He is also liable to the private action\r\nof any party who may have been injured by his illegal mandates or\r\ninstructions in the same manner and to the same extent as the humblest\r\nfunctionary. In addition to the responsibilities which may thus be\r\nenforced by impeachment, criminal prosecution, or suit at law, he\r\nis also accountable at the bar of public opinion for every act of his\r\nAdministration. Subject only to the restraints of truth and justice,\r\nthe free people of the United States have the undoubted right, as\r\nindividuals or collectively, orally or in writing, at such times and in\r\nsuch language and form as they may think proper, to discuss his official\r\nconduct and to express and promulgate their opinions concerning it.\r\nIndirectly also his conduct may come under review in either branch of\r\nthe Legislature, or in the Senate when acting in its executive capacity,\r\nand so far as the executive or legislative proceedings of these bodies\r\nmay require it, it may be exercised by them. These are believed to be\r\nthe proper and only modes in which the President of the United States\r\nis to be held accountable for his official conduct.\r\n\r\nTested by these principles, the resolution of the Senate is wholly\r\nunauthorized by the Constitution, and in derogation of its entire\r\nspirit. It assumes that a single branch of the legislative department\r\nmay for the purposes of a public censure, and without any view to\r\nlegislation or impeachment, take up, consider, and decide upon the\r\nofficial acts of the Executive. But in no part of the Constitution is\r\nthe President subjected to any such responsibility, and in no part of\r\nthat instrument is any such power conferred on either branch of the\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\nThe justice of these conclusions will be illustrated and confirmed by\r\na brief analysis of the powers of the Senate and a comparison of their\r\nrecent proceedings with those powers.\r\n\r\nThe high functions assigned by the Constitution to the Senate are in\r\ntheir nature either legislative, executive, or judicial. It is only in\r\nthe exercise of its judicial powers, when sitting as a court for the\r\ntrial of impeachments, that the Senate is expressly authorized and\r\nnecessarily required to consider and decide upon the conduct of the\r\nPresident or any other public officer. Indirectly, however, as has\r\nalready been suggested, it may frequently be called on to perform that\r\noffice. Cases may occur in the course of its legislative or executive\r\nproceedings in which it may be indispensable to the proper exercise of\r\nits powers that it should inquire into and decide upon the conduct of\r\nthe President or other public officers, and in every such case its\r\nconstitutional right to do so is cheerfully conceded. But to authorize\r\nthe Senate to enter on such a task in its legislative or executive\r\ncapacity the inquiry must actually grow out of and tend to some\r\nlegislative or executive action, and the decision, when expressed,\r\nmust take the form of some appropriate legislative or executive act.\r\n\r\nThe resolution in question was introduced, discussed, and passed not as\r\na joint but as a separate resolution. It asserts no legislative power,\r\nproposes no legislative action, and neither possesses the form nor any\r\nof the attributes of a legislative measure. It does not appear to have\r\nbeen entertained or passed with any view or expectation of its issuing\r\nin a law or joint resolution, or in the repeal of any law or joint\r\nresolution, or in any other legislative action.\r\n\r\nWhilst wanting both the form and substance of a legislative measure,\r\nit is equally manifest that the resolution was not justified by any\r\nof the executive powers conferred on the Senate. These powers relate\r\nexclusively to the consideration of treaties and nominations to office,\r\nand they are exercised in secret session and with closed doors. This\r\nresolution does not apply to any treaty or nomination, and was passed\r\nin a public session.\r\n\r\nNor does this proceeding in any way belong to that class of incidental\r\nresolutions which relate to the officers of the Senate, to their Chamber\r\nand other appurtenances, or to subjects of order and other matters of\r\nthe like nature, in all which either House may lawfully proceed without\r\nany cooperation with the other or with the President.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the whole phraseology and sense of the resolution seem\r\nto be judicial. Its essence, true character, and only practical effect\r\nare to be found in the conduct which it charges upon the President and\r\nin the judgment which it pronounces on that conduct. The resolution,\r\ntherefore, though discussed and adopted by the Senate in its legislative\r\ncapacity, is in its office and in all its characteristics essentially\r\njudicial.\r\n\r\nThat the Senate possesses a high judicial power and that instances may\r\noccur in which the President of the United States will be amenable to it\r\nis undeniable; but under the provisions of the Constitution it would\r\nseem to be equally plain that neither the President nor any other\r\nofficer can be rightfully subjected to the operation of the judicial\r\npower of the Senate except in the cases and under the forms prescribed\r\nby the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution declares that \"the President, Vice-President, and all\r\ncivil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on\r\nimpeachment for and conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes\r\nand misdemeanors;\" that the House of Representatives \"shall have the\r\nsole power of impeachment;\" that the Senate \"shall have the sole power\r\nto try all impeachments;\" that \"when sitting for that purpose they shall\r\nbe on oath or affirmation;\" that \"when the President of the United\r\nStates is tried the Chief Justice shall preside;\" that \"no person shall\r\nbe convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members\r\npresent,\" and that \"judgment shall not extend further than to removal\r\nfrom office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor,\r\ntrust, or profit under the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution above quoted charges, in substance, that in certain\r\nproceedings relating to the public revenue the President has usurped\r\nauthority and power not conferred upon him by the Constitution and\r\nlaws, and that in doing so he violated both. Any such act constitutes\r\na high crime--one of the highest, indeed, which the President can\r\ncommit--a crime which justly exposes him to impeachment by the House\r\nof Representatives, and, upon due conviction, to removal from office\r\nand to the complete and immutable disfranchisement prescribed by the\r\nConstitution. The resolution, then, was in substance an impeachment of\r\nthe President, and in its passage amounts to a declaration by a majority\r\nof the Senate that he is guilty of an impeachable offense. As such it is\r\nspread upon the journals of the Senate, published to the nation and to\r\nthe world, made part of our enduring archives, and incorporated in the\r\nhistory of the age. The punishment of removal from office and future\r\ndisqualification does not, it is true, follow this decision, nor would\r\nit have followed the like decision if the regular forms of proceeding\r\nhad been pursued, because the requisite number did not concur in the\r\nresult. But the moral influence of a solemn declaration by a majority of\r\nthe Senate that the accused is guilty of the offense charged upon him\r\nhas been as effectually secured as if the like declaration had been\r\nmade upon an impeachment expressed in the same terms. Indeed, a greater\r\npractical effect has been gained, because the votes given for the\r\nresolution, though not sufficient to authorize a judgment of guilty\r\non an impeachment, were numerous enough to carry that resolution.\r\n\r\nThat the resolution does not expressly allege that the assumption of\r\npower and authority which it condemns was intentional and corrupt is no\r\nanswer to the preceding view of its character and effect. The act thus\r\ncondemned necessarily implies volition and design in the individual to\r\nwhom it is imputed, and, being unlawful in its character, the legal\r\nconclusion is that it was prompted by improper motives and committed\r\nwith an unlawful intent. The charge is not of a mistake in the exercise\r\nof supposed powers, but of the assumption of powers not conferred by\r\nthe Constitution and laws, but in derogation of both, and nothing is\r\nsuggested to excuse or palliate the turpitude of the act. In the absence\r\nof any such excuse or palliation there is only room for one inference,\r\nand that is that the intent was unlawful and corrupt. Besides, the\r\nresolution not only contains no mitigating suggestions, but, on the\r\ncontrary, it holds up the act complained of as justly obnoxious to\r\ncensure and reprobation, and thus as distinctly stamps it with impurity\r\nof motive as if the strongest epithets had been used.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States, therefore, has been by a majority of\r\nhis constitutional triers accused and found guilty of an impeachable\r\noffense, but in no part of this proceeding have the directions of the\r\nConstitution been observed.\r\n\r\nThe impeachment, instead of being preferred and prosecuted by the House\r\nof Representatives, originated in the Senate, and was prosecuted without\r\nthe aid or concurrence of the other House. The oath or affirmation\r\nprescribed by the Constitution was not taken by the Senators, the Chief\r\nJustice did not preside, no notice of the charge was given to the\r\naccused, and no opportunity afforded him to respond to the accusation,\r\nto meet his accusers face to face, to cross-examine the witnesses, to\r\nprocure counteracting testimony, or to be heard in his defense. The\r\nsafeguards and formalities which the Constitution has connected with\r\nthe power of impeachment were doubtless supposed by the framers of that\r\ninstrument to be essential to the protection of the public servant, to\r\nthe attainment of justice, and to the order, impartiality, and dignity\r\nof the procedure. These safeguards and formalities were not only\r\npractically disregarded in the commencement and conduct of these\r\nproceedings, but in their result I find myself convicted by less than\r\ntwo-thirds of the members present of an impeachable offense.\r\n\r\nIn vain may it be alleged in defense of this proceeding that the form of\r\nthe resolution is not that of an impeachment or of a judgment thereupon,\r\nthat the punishment prescribed in the Constitution does not follow its\r\nadoption, or that in this case no impeachment is to be expected from the\r\nHouse of Representatives. It is because it did not assume the form of an\r\nimpeachment that it is the more palpably repugnant to the Constitution,\r\nfor it is through that form only that the President is judicially\r\nresponsible to the Senate; and though neither removal from office nor\r\nfuture disqualification ensues, yet it is not to be presumed that the\r\nframers of the Constitution considered either or both of those results\r\nas constituting the whole of the punishment they prescribed. The\r\njudgment of _guilty_ by the highest tribunal in the Union, the stigma it\r\nwould inflict on the offender, his family, and fame, and the perpetual\r\nrecord on the Journal, handing down to future generations the story of\r\nhis disgrace, were doubtless regarded by them as the bitterest portions,\r\nif not the very essence, of that punishment. So far, therefore, as some\r\nof its most material parts are concerned, the passage, recording, and\r\npromulgation of the resolution are an attempt to bring them on the\r\nPresident in a manner unauthorized by the Constitution. To shield him\r\nand other officers who are liable to impeachment from consequences\r\nso momentous, except when really merited by official delinquencies,\r\nthe Constitution has most carefully guarded the whole process of\r\nimpeachment. A majority of the House of Representatives must think the\r\nofficer guilty before he can be charged. Two-thirds of the Senate must\r\npronounce him guilty or he is deemed to be innocent. Forty-six Senators\r\nappear by the Journal to have been present when the vote on the\r\nresolution was taken. If after all the solemnities of an impeachment\r\nthirty of those Senators had voted that the President was guilty, yet\r\nwould he have been acquitted; but by the mode of proceeding adopted in\r\nthe present case a lasting record of conviction has been entered up by\r\nthe votes of twenty-six Senators without an impeachment or trial, whilst\r\nthe Constitution expressly declares that to the entry of such a judgment\r\nan accusation by the House of Representatives, a trial by the Senate,\r\nand a concurrence of two-thirds in the vote of guilty shall be\r\nindispensable prerequisites.\r\n\r\nWhether or not an impeachment was to be expected from the House of\r\nRepresentatives was a point on which the Senate had no constitutional\r\nright to speculate, and in respect to which, even had it possessed the\r\nspirit of prophecy, its anticipations would have furnished no just\r\nground for this procedure. Admitting that there was reason to believe\r\nthat a violation of the Constitution and laws had been actually\r\ncommitted by the President, still it was the duty of the Senate, as his\r\nsole constitutional judges, to wait for an impeachment until the other\r\nHouse should think proper to prefer it. The members of the Senate\r\ncould have no right to infer that no impeachment was intended. On the\r\ncontrary, every legal and rational presumption on their part ought to\r\nhave been that if there was good reason to believe him guilty of an\r\nimpeachable offense the House of Representatives would perform its\r\nconstitutional duty by arraigning the offender before the justice of\r\nhis country. The contrary presumption would involve an implication\r\nderogatory to the integrity and honor of the representatives of the\r\npeople. But suppose the suspicion thus implied were actually entertained\r\nand for good cause, how can it justify the assumption by the Senate of\r\npowers not conferred by the Constitution?\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to look at the condition in which the Senate and\r\nthe President have been placed by this proceeding to perceive its utter\r\nincompatibility with the provisions and the spirit of the Constitution\r\nand with the plainest dictates of humanity and justice.\r\n\r\nIf the House of Representatives shall be of opinion that there is just\r\nground for the censure pronounced upon the President, then will it be\r\nthe solemn duty of that House to prefer the proper accusation and to\r\ncause him to be brought to trial by the constitutional tribunal. But in\r\nwhat condition would he find that tribunal? A majority of its members\r\nhave already considered the case, and have not only formed but expressed\r\na deliberate judgment upon its merits. It is the policy of our benign\r\nsystems of jurisprudence to secure in all criminal proceedings, and even\r\nin the most trivial litigations, a fair, unprejudiced, and impartial\r\ntrial, and surely it can not be less important that such a trial should\r\nbe secured to the highest officer of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution makes the House of Representatives the exclusive\r\njudges, in the first instance, of the question whether the President\r\nhas committed an impeachable offense. A majority of the Senate, whose\r\ninterference with this preliminary question has for the best of all\r\nreasons been studiously excluded, anticipate the action of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, assume not only the function which belongs exclusively\r\nto that body, but convert themselves into accusers, witnesses, counsel,\r\nand judges, and prejudge the whole case, thus presenting the appalling\r\nspectacle in a free State of judges going through a labored preparation\r\nfor an impartial hearing and decision by a previous _ex parte_\r\ninvestigation and sentence against the supposed offender.\r\n\r\nThere is no more settled axiom in that Government whence we derived the\r\nmodel of this part of our Constitution than that \"the lords can not\r\nimpeach any to themselves, nor join in the accusation, _because they\r\nare judges_.\" Independently of the general reasons on which this rule\r\nis founded, its propriety and importance are greatly increased by the\r\nnature of the impeaching power. The power of arraigning the high\r\nofficers of government before a tribunal whose sentence may expel them\r\nfrom their seats and brand them as infamous is eminently a popular\r\nremedy--a remedy designed to be employed for the protection of private\r\nright and public liberty against the abuses of injustice and the\r\nencroachments of arbitrary power. But the framers of the Constitution\r\nwere also undoubtedly aware that this formidable instrument had been and\r\nmight be abused, and that from its very nature an impeachment for high\r\ncrimes and misdemeanors, whatever might be its result, would in most\r\ncases be accompanied by so much of dishonor and reproach, solicitude and\r\nsuffering, as to make the power of preferring it one of the highest\r\nsolemnity and importance. It was due to both these considerations that\r\nthe impeaching power should be lodged in the hands of those who from\r\nthe mode of their election and the tenure of their offices would most\r\naccurately express the popular will and at the same time be most\r\ndirectly and speedily amenable to the people. The theory of these wise\r\nand benignant intentions is in the present case effectually defeated by\r\nthe proceedings of the Senate. The members of that body represent not\r\nthe people, but the States; and though they are undoubtedly responsible\r\nto the States, yet from their extended term of service the effect of\r\nthat responsibility during the whole period of that term must very much\r\ndepend upon their own impressions of its obligatory force. When a body\r\nthus constituted expresses beforehand its opinion in a particular case,\r\nand thus indirectly invites a prosecution, it not only assumes a power\r\nintended for wise reasons to be confined to others, but it shields the\r\nlatter from that exclusive and personal responsibility under which it\r\nwas intended to be exercised, and reverses the whole scheme of this\r\npart of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nSuch would be some of the objections to this procedure, even if it were\r\nadmitted that there is just ground for imputing to the President the\r\noffenses charged in the resolution. But if, on the other hand, the House\r\nof Representatives shall be of opinion that there is no reason for\r\ncharging them upon him, and shall therefore deem it improper to prefer\r\nan impeachment, then will the violation of privilege as it respects that\r\nHouse, of justice as it regards the President, and of the Constitution\r\nas it relates to both be only the more conspicuous and impressive.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional mode of procedure on an impeachment has not only been\r\nwholly disregarded, but some of the first principles of natural right\r\nand enlightened jurisprudence have been violated in the very form of the\r\nresolution. It carefully abstains from averring in _which_ of \"the late\r\nproceedings in relation to the public revenue the President has assumed\r\nupon himself authority and power not conferred by the Constitution and\r\nlaws,\" It carefully abstains from specifying _what laws_ or _what parts_\r\nof the Constitution have been violated. Why was not the certainty of the\r\noffense--\"the nature and cause of the accusation\"--set out in the manner\r\nrequired in the Constitution before even the humblest individual, for\r\nthe smallest crime, can be exposed to condemnation? Such a specification\r\nwas due to the accused that he might direct his defense to the real\r\npoints of attack, to the people that they might clearly understand in\r\nwhat particulars their institutions had been violated, and to the truth\r\nand certainty of our public annals. As the record now stands, whilst\r\nthe resolution plainly charges upon the President at least one act of\r\nusurpation in \"the late Executive proceedings in relation to the public\r\nrevenue,\" and is so framed that those Senators who believed that one\r\nsuch act, and only one, had been committed could assent to it, its\r\nlanguage is yet broad enough to include several such acts, and so it\r\nmay have been regarded by some of those who voted for it. But though\r\nthe accusation is thus comprehensive in the censures it implies, there\r\nis no such certainty of time, place, or circumstance as to exhibit the\r\nparticular conclusion of fact or law which induced any one Senator to\r\nvote for it; and it may well have happened that whilst one Senator\r\nbelieved that some particular act embraced in the resolution was an\r\narbitrary and unconstitutional assumption of power, others of the\r\nmajority may have deemed that very act both constitutional and\r\nexpedient, or, if not expedient, yet still within the pale of the\r\nConstitution; and thus a majority of the Senators may have been enabled\r\nto concur in a vague and undefined accusation that the President, in\r\nthe course of \"the late Executive proceedings in relation to the public\r\nrevenue,\" had violated the Constitution and laws, whilst if a separate\r\nvote had been taken in respect to each particular act included within\r\nthe general terms the accusers of the President might on any such vote\r\nhave been found in the minority.\r\n\r\nStill further to exemplify this feature of the proceeding, it is\r\nimportant to be remarked that the resolution as originally offered\r\nto the Senate specified with adequate precision certain acts of the\r\nPresident which it denounced as a violation of the Constitution and\r\nlaws, and that it was not until the very close of the debate, and\r\nwhen perhaps it was apprehended that a majority might not sustain the\r\nspecific accusation contained in it, that the resolution was so modified\r\nas to assume its present form. A more striking illustration of the\r\nsoundness and necessity of the rules which forbid vague and indefinite\r\ngeneralities and require a reasonable certainty in all judicial\r\nallegations, and a more glaring instance of the violation of those\r\nrules, has seldom been exhibited.\r\n\r\nIn this view of the resolution it must certainly be regarded not as a\r\nvindication of any particular provision of the law or the Constitution,\r\nbut simply as an official rebuke or condemnatory sentence, too general\r\nand indefinite to be easily repelled, but yet sufficiently precise to\r\nbring into discredit the conduct and motives of the Executive. But\r\nwhatever it may have been intended to accomplish, it is obvious that\r\nthe vague, general, and abstract form of the resolution is in perfect\r\nkeeping with those other departures from first principles and settled\r\nimprovements in jurisprudence so properly the boast of free countries\r\nin modern times. And it is not too much to say of the whole of these\r\nproceedings that if they shall be approved and sustained by an\r\nintelligent people, then will that great contest with arbitrary power\r\nwhich had established in statutes, in bills of rights, in sacred\r\ncharters, and in constitutions of government the right of every citizen\r\nto a notice before trial, to a hearing before conviction, and to an\r\nimpartial tribunal for deciding on the charge have been waged in vain.\r\n\r\nIf the resolution had been left in its original form it is not to be\r\npresumed that it could ever have received the assent of a majority\r\nof the Senate, for the acts therein specified as violations of the\r\nConstitution and laws were clearly within the limits of the Executive\r\nauthority. They are the \"dismissing the late Secretary of the Treasury\r\nbecause he would not, contrary to his sense of his own duty, remove the\r\nmoney of the United States in deposit with the Bank of the United States\r\nand its branches in conformity with the President's opinion, and\r\nappointing his successor to effect such removal, which has been done.\"\r\nBut as no other specification has been substituted, and as these were\r\nthe \"Executive proceedings in relation to the public revenue\"\r\nprincipally referred to in the course of the discussion, they will\r\ndoubtless be generally regarded as the acts intended to be denounced as\r\n\"an assumption of authority and power not conferred by the Constitution\r\nor laws, but in derogation of both.\" It is therefore due to the occasion\r\nthat a condensed summary of the views of the Executive in respect to\r\nthem should be here exhibited.\r\n\r\nBy the Constitution \"the executive power is vested in a President\r\nof the United States.\" Among the duties imposed upon him, and which he\r\nis sworn to perform, is that of \"taking care that the laws be faithfully\r\nexecuted.\" Being thus made responsible for the entire action of the\r\nexecutive department, it was but reasonable that the power of\r\nappointing, overseeing, and controlling those who execute the laws--a\r\npower in its nature executive--should remain in his hands. It is\r\ntherefore not only his right, but the Constitution makes it his duty,\r\nto \"nominate and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,\r\nappoint\" all \"officers of the United States whose appointments are not\r\nin the Constitution otherwise provided for,\" with a proviso that the\r\nappointment of inferior officers may be vested in the President alone,\r\nin the courts of justice, or in the heads of Departments.\r\n\r\nThe executive power vested in the Senate is neither that of \"nominating\"\r\nnor \"appointing.\" It is merely a check upon the Executive power of\r\nappointment. If individuals are proposed for appointment by the\r\nPresident by them deemed incompetent or unworthy, they may withhold\r\ntheir consent and the appointment can not be made. They check the\r\naction of the Executive, but can not in relation to those very subjects\r\nact themselves nor direct him. Selections are still made by the\r\nPresident, and the negative given to the Senate, without diminishing his\r\nresponsibility, furnishes an additional guaranty to the country that the\r\nsubordinate executive as well as the judicial offices shall be filled\r\nwith worthy and competent men.\r\n\r\nThe whole executive power being vested in the President, who is\r\nresponsible for its exercise, it is a necessary consequence that he\r\nshould have a right to employ agents of his own choice to aid him in the\r\nperformance of his duties, and to discharge them when he is no longer\r\nwilling to be responsible for their acts. In strict accordance with this\r\nprinciple, the power of removal, which, like that of appointment, is\r\nan original executive power, is left unchecked by the Constitution in\r\nrelation to all executive officers, for whose conduct the President\r\nis responsible, while it is taken from him in relation to judicial\r\nofficers, for whose acts he is not responsible. In the Government from\r\nwhich many of the fundamental principles of our system are derived the\r\nhead of the executive department originally had power to appoint and\r\nremove at will all officers, executive and judicial. It was to take\r\nthe judges out of this general power of removal, and thus make them\r\nindependent of the Executive, that the tenure of their offices was\r\nchanged to good behavior. Nor is it conceivable why they are placed in\r\nour Constitution upon a tenure different from that of all other officers\r\nappointed by the Executive unless it be for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nBut if there were any just ground for doubt on the face of the\r\nConstitution whether all executive officers are removable at the will of\r\nthe President, it is obviated by the cotemporaneous construction of the\r\ninstrument and the uniform practice under it.\r\n\r\nThe power of removal was a topic of solemn debate in the Congress of\r\n1789 while organizing the administrative departments of the Government,\r\nand it was finally decided that the President derived from the\r\nConstitution the power of removal so far as it regards that department\r\nfor whose acts he is responsible. Although the debate covered the whole\r\nground, embracing the Treasury as well as all the other Executive\r\nDepartments, it arose on a motion to strike out of the bill to establish\r\na Department of Foreign Affairs, since called the Department of State,\r\na clause declaring the Secretary \"to be removable from office by the\r\nPresident of the United States.\" After that motion had been decided in\r\nthe negative it was perceived that these words did not convey the sense\r\nof the House of Representatives in relation to the true source of\r\nthe power of removal. With the avowed object of preventing any future\r\ninference that this power was exercised by the President in virtue of\r\na grant from Congress, when in fact that body considered it as derived\r\nfrom the Constitution, the words which had been the subject of debate\r\nwere struck out, and in lieu thereof a clause was inserted in a\r\nprovision concerning the chief clerk of the Department, which declared\r\nthat \"whenever the said principal officer shall be removed from office\r\nby the President of the United States, or in any other case of vacancy,\"\r\nthe chief clerk should during such vacancy have charge of the papers\r\nof the office. This change having been made for the express purpose of\r\ndeclaring the sense of Congress that the President derived the power\r\nof removal from the Constitution, the act as it passed has always been\r\nconsidered as a full expression of the sense of the legislature on this\r\nimportant part of the American Constitution.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have the concurrent authority of President Washington, of\r\nthe Senate, and the House of Representatives, numbers of whom had taken\r\nan active part in the convention which framed the Constitution and in\r\nthe State conventions which adopted it, that the President derived an\r\nunqualified power of removal from that instrument itself, which is\r\n\"beyond the reach of legislative authority.\" Upon this principle the\r\nGovernment has now been steadily administered for about forty-five\r\nyears, during which there have been numerous removals made by the\r\nPresident or by his direction, embracing every grade of executive\r\nofficers from the heads of Departments to the messengers of bureaus.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury Department in the discussions of 1789 was considered on\r\nthe same footing as the other Executive Departments, and in the act\r\nestablishing it were incorporated the precise words indicative of the\r\nsense of Congress that the President derives his power to remove the\r\nSecretary from the Constitution, which appear in the act establishing\r\nthe Department of Foreign Affairs. An Assistant Secretary of the\r\nTreasury was created, and it was provided that he should take charge of\r\nthe books and papers of the Department \"whenever the Secretary shall\r\nbe removed from office by the President of the United States.\" The\r\nSecretary of the Treasury being appointed by the President, and being\r\nconsidered as constitutionally removable by him, it appears never to\r\nhave occurred to anyone in the Congress of 1789, or since until very\r\nrecently, that he was other than an executive officer, the mere\r\ninstrument of the Chief Magistrate in the execution of the laws,\r\nsubject, like all other heads of Departments, to his supervision and\r\ncontrol. No such idea as an officer of the Congress can be found in the\r\nConstitution or appears to have suggested itself to those who organized\r\nthe Government. There are officers of each House the appointment of\r\nwhich is authorized by the Constitution, but all officers referred to in\r\nthat instrument as coming within the appointing power of the President,\r\nwhether established thereby or created by law, are \"officers of the\r\nUnited States.\" No joint power of appointment is given to the two Houses\r\nof Congress, nor is there any accountability to them as one body; but\r\nas soon as any office is created by law, of whatever name or character,\r\nthe appointment of the person or persons to fill it devolves by the\r\nConstitution upon the President, with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate, unless it be an inferior office, and the appointment be vested\r\nby the law itself \"in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in\r\nthe heads of Departments.\"\r\n\r\nBut at the time of the organization of the Treasury Department an\r\nincident occurred which distinctly evinces the unanimous concurrence\r\nof the First Congress in the principle that the Treasury Department is\r\nwholly executive in its character and responsibilities. A motion was\r\nmade to strike out the provision of the bill making it the duty of the\r\nSecretary \"to digest and report plans for the improvement and management\r\nof the revenue and for the support of public credit,\" on the ground\r\nthat it would give the executive department of the Government too much\r\ninfluence and power in Congress. The motion was not opposed on the\r\nground that the Secretary was the officer of Congress and responsible\r\nto that body, which would have been conclusive if admitted, but on other\r\nground, which conceded his executive character throughout. The whole\r\ndiscussion evinces an unanimous concurrence in the principle that the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury is wholly an executive officer, and the\r\nstruggle of the minority was to restrict his power as such. From that\r\ntime down to the present the Secretary of the Treasury, the Treasurer,\r\nRegister, Comptrollers, Auditors, and clerks who fill the offices of\r\nthat Department have in the practice of the Government been considered\r\nand treated as on the same footing with corresponding grades of officers\r\nin all the other Executive Departments.\r\n\r\nThe custody of the public property, under such regulations as may be\r\nprescribed by legislative authority, has always been considered an\r\nappropriate function of the executive department in this and all other\r\nGovernments. In accordance with this principle, every species of\r\nproperty belonging to the United States (excepting that which is in the\r\nuse of the several coordinate departments of the Government as means\r\nto aid them in performing their appropriate functions) is in charge of\r\nofficers appointed by the President, whether it be lands, or buildings,\r\nor merchandise, or provisions, or clothing, or arms and munitions of\r\nwar. The superintendents and keepers of the whole are appointed by the\r\nPresident, responsible to him, and removable at his will.\r\n\r\nPublic money is but a species of public property. It can not be raised\r\nby taxation or customs, nor brought into the Treasury in any other way\r\nexcept by law; but whenever or howsoever obtained, its custody always\r\nhas been and always must be, unless the Constitution be changed,\r\nintrusted to the executive department. No officer can be created by\r\nCongress for the purpose of taking charge of it whose appointment would\r\nnot by the Constitution at once devolve on the President and who would\r\nnot be responsible to him for the faithful performance of his duties.\r\nThe legislative power may undoubtedly bind him and the President by any\r\nlaws they may think proper to enact; they may prescribe in what place\r\nparticular portions of the public property shall be kept and for what\r\nreason it shall be removed, as they may direct that supplies for the\r\nArmy or Navy shall be kept in particular stores, and it will be the duty\r\nof the President to see that the law is faithfully executed; yet will\r\nthe custody remain in the executive department of the Government. Were\r\nthe Congress to assume, with or without a legislative act, the power of\r\nappointing officers, independently of the President, to take the charge\r\nand custody of the public property contained in the military and naval\r\narsenals, magazines, and storehouses, it is believed that such an act\r\nwould be regarded by all as a palpable usurpation of executive power,\r\nsubversive of the form as well as the fundamental principles of our\r\nGovernment. But where is the difference in principle whether the public\r\nproperty be in the form of arms, munitions of war, and supplies or in\r\ngold and silver or bank notes? None can be perceived; none is believed\r\nto exist. Congress can not, therefore, take out of the hands of the\r\nexecutive department the custody of the public property or money without\r\nan assumption of executive power and a subversion of the first\r\nprinciples of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of the United States have never passed an act imperatively\r\ndirecting that the public moneys shall be kept in any particular place\r\nor places. From the origin of the Government to the year 1816 the\r\nstatute book was wholly silent on the subject. In 1789 a Treasurer was\r\ncreated, subordinate to the Secretary of the Treasury, and through him\r\nto the President. He was required to give bond safely to keep and\r\nfaithfully to disburse the public moneys, without any direction as to\r\nthe manner or places in which they should be kept. By reference to the\r\npractice of the Government it is found that from its first organization\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, acting under the supervision of the\r\nPresident, designated the places in which the public moneys should be\r\nkept, and especially directed all transfers from place to place. This\r\npractice was continued, with the silent acquiescence of Congress, from\r\n1789 down to 1816, and although many banks were selected and discharged,\r\nand although a portion of the moneys were first placed in the State\r\nbanks, and then in the former Bank of the United States, and upon the\r\ndissolution of that were again transferred to the State banks, no\r\nlegislation was thought necessary by Congress, and all the operations\r\nwere originated and perfected by Executive authority. The Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, responsible to the President, and with his approbation,\r\nmade contracts and arrangements in relation to the whole subject-matter,\r\nwhich was thus entirely committed to the direction of the President\r\nunder his responsibilities to the American people and to those who were\r\nauthorized to impeach and punish him for any breach of this important\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1816 establishing the Bank of the United States directed the\r\ndeposits of public money to be made in that bank and its branches in\r\nplaces in which the said bank and branches thereof may be established,\r\n\"unless the Secretary of the Treasury should otherwise order and\r\ndirect,\" in which event he was required to give his reasons to Congress.\r\nThis was but a continuation of his preexisting power as the head of an\r\nExecutive Department to direct where the deposits should be made, with\r\nthe superadded obligation of giving his reasons to Congress for making\r\nthem elsewhere than in the Bank of the United States and its branches.\r\nIt is not to be considered that this provision in any degree altered the\r\nrelation between the Secretary of the Treasury and the President as the\r\nresponsible head of the executive department, or released the latter\r\nfrom his constitutional obligation to \"take care that the laws be\r\nfaithfully executed.\" On the contrary, it increased his responsibilities\r\nby adding another to the long list of laws which it was his duty to\r\ncarry into effect.\r\n\r\nIt would be an extraordinary result if because the person charged by\r\nlaw with a public duty is one of his Secretaries it were less the duty\r\nof the President to see that law faithfully executed than other laws\r\nenjoining duties upon subordinate officers or private citizens. If there\r\nbe any difference, it would seem that the obligation is the stronger in\r\nrelation to the former, because the neglect is in his presence and the\r\nremedy at hand.\r\n\r\nIt can not be doubted that it was the legal duty of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury to order and direct the deposits of the public money to be made\r\nelsewhere than in the Bank of the United States _whenever sufficient\r\nreasons existed for making the change_. If in such a case he neglected\r\nor refused to act, he would neglect or refuse to execute the law.\r\nWhat would be the sworn duty of the President? Could he say that the\r\nConstitution did not bind him to see the law faithfully executed because\r\nit was one of his Secretaries and not himself upon whom the service was\r\nspecially imposed? Might he not be asked whether there was any such\r\nlimitation to his obligations prescribed in the Constitution? Whether he\r\nis not equally bound to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\r\nwhether they impose duties on the highest officer of State or the lowest\r\nsubordinate in any of the Departments? Might he not be told that it was\r\nfor the sole purpose of causing all executive officers, from the highest\r\nto the lowest, faithfully to perform the services required of them by\r\nlaw that the people of the United States have made him their Chief\r\nMagistrate and the Constitution has clothed him with the entire\r\nexecutive power of this Government? The principles implied in these\r\nquestions appear too plain to need elucidation.\r\n\r\nBut here also we have a cotemporaneous construction of the act which\r\nshows that it was not understood as in any way changing the relations\r\nbetween the President and Secretary of the Treasury, or as placing the\r\nlatter out of Executive control even in relation to the deposits of the\r\npublic money. Nor on that point are we left to any equivocal testimony.\r\nThe documents of the Treasury Department show that the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury did apply to the President and obtained his approbation and\r\nsanction to the original transfer of the public deposits to the present\r\nBank of the United States, and did carry the measure into effect in\r\nobedience to his decision. They also show that transfers of the public\r\ndeposits from the branches of the Bank of the United States to State\r\nbanks at Chillicothe, Cincinnati, and Louisville, in 1819, were made\r\nwith the approbation of the President and by his authority. They show\r\nthat upon all important questions appertaining to his Department,\r\nwhether they related to the public deposits or other matters, it was\r\nthe constant practice of the Secretary of the Treasury to obtain for\r\nhis acts the approval and sanction of the President. These acts and the\r\nprinciples on which they were founded were known to all the departments\r\nof the Government, to Congress and the country, and until very recently\r\nappear never to have been called in question.\r\n\r\nThus was it settled by the Constitution, the laws, and the whole\r\npractice of the Government that the entire executive power is vested\r\nin the President of the United States; that as incident to that power\r\nthe right of appointing and removing those officers who are to aid\r\nhim in the execution of the laws, with such restrictions only as the\r\nConstitution prescribes, is vested in the President; that the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury is one of those officers; that the custody of the public\r\nproperty and money is an Executive function which, in relation to the\r\nmoney, has always been exercised through the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nand his subordinates; that in the performance of these duties he is\r\nsubject to the supervision and control of the President, and in all\r\nimportant measures having relation to them consults the Chief Magistrate\r\nand obtains his approval and sanction; that the law establishing the\r\nbank did not, as it could not, change the relation between the President\r\nand the Secretary--did not release the former from his obligation to\r\nsee the law faithfully executed nor the latter from the President's\r\nsupervision and control; that afterwards and before the Secretary did\r\nin fact consult and obtain the sanction of the President to transfers\r\nand removals of the public deposits, and that all departments of the\r\nGovernment, and the nation itself, approved or acquiesced in these acts\r\nand principles as in strict conformity with our Constitution and laws.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year the approaching termination, according to the\r\nprovisions of its charter and the solemn decision of the American\r\npeople, of the Bank of the United States made it expedient, and its\r\nexposed abuses and corruptions made it, in my opinion, the duty of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, to place the moneys of the United States in\r\nother depositories. The Secretary did not concur in that opinion, and\r\ndeclined giving the necessary order and direction. So glaring were the\r\nabuses and corruptions of the bank, so evident its fixed purpose to\r\npersevere in them, and so palpable its design by its money and power to\r\ncontrol the Government and change its character, that I deemed it the\r\nimperative duty of the Executive authority, by the exertion of every\r\npower confided to it by the Constitution and laws, to check its career\r\nand lessen its ability to do mischief, even in the painful alternative\r\nof dismissing the head of one of the Departments. At the time the\r\nremoval was made other causes sufficient to justify it existed, but\r\nif they had not the Secretary would have been dismissed for this\r\ncause only.\r\n\r\nHis place I supplied by one whose opinions were well known to me,\r\nand whose frank expression of them in another situation and generous\r\nsacrifices of interest and feeling when unexpectedly called to the\r\nstation he now occupies ought forever to have shielded his motives from\r\nSuspicion and his character from reproach. In accordance with the views\r\nlong before expressed by him he proceeded, with my sanction, to make\r\narrangements for depositing the moneys of the United States in other\r\nsafe institutions.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the Senate as originally framed and as passed, if it\r\nrefers to these acts, presupposes a right in that body to interfere with\r\nthis exercise of Executive power. If the principle be once admitted, it\r\nis not difficult to perceive where it may end. If by a mere denunciation\r\nlike this resolution the President should ever be induced to act in a\r\nmatter of official duty contrary to the honest convictions of his own\r\nmind in compliance with the wishes of the Senate, the constitutional\r\nindependence of the executive department would be as effectually\r\ndestroyed and its power as effectually transferred to the Senate as if\r\nthat end had been accomplished by an amendment of the Constitution. But\r\nif the Senate have a right to interfere with the Executive powers, they\r\nhave also the right to make that interference effective, and if the\r\nassertion of the power implied in the resolution be silently acquiesced\r\nin we may reasonably apprehend that it will be followed at some future\r\nday by an attempt at actual enforcement. The Senate may refuse, except\r\non the condition that he will surrender his opinions to theirs and obey\r\ntheir will, to perform their own constitutional functions, to pass the\r\nnecessary laws, to sanction appropriations proposed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and to confirm proper nominations made by the\r\nPresident. It has already been maintained (and it is not conceivable\r\nthat the resolution of the Senate can be based on any other principle)\r\nthat the Secretary of the Treasury is the officer of Congress and\r\nindependent of the President; that the President has no right to control\r\nhim, and consequently none to remove him. With the same propriety and on\r\nsimilar grounds may the Secretary of State, the Secretaries of War and\r\nthe Navy, and the Postmaster-General each in succession be declared\r\nindependent of the President, the subordinates of Congress, and\r\nremovable only with the concurrence of the Senate. Followed to its\r\nconsequences, this principle will be found effectually to destroy one\r\ncoordinate department of the Government, to concentrate in the hands\r\nof the Senate the whole executive power, and to leave the President\r\nas powerless as he would be useless--the shadow of authority after\r\nthe substance had departed.\r\n\r\nThe time and the occasion which have called forth the resolution of the\r\nSenate seem to impose upon me an additional obligation not to pass it\r\nover in silence. Nearly forty-five years had the President exercised,\r\nwithout a question as to his rightful authority, those powers for the\r\nrecent assumption of which he is now denounced. The vicissitudes of\r\npeace and war had attended our Government; violent parties, watchful to\r\ntake advantage of any seeming usurpation on the part of the Executive,\r\nhad distracted our councils; frequent removals, or forced resignations\r\nin every sense tantamount to removals, had been made of the Secretary\r\nand other officers of the Treasury, and yet in no one instance is it\r\nknown that any man, whether patriot or partisan, had raised his voice\r\nagainst it as a violation of the Constitution. The expediency and\r\njustice of such changes in reference to public officers of all grades\r\nhave frequently been the topic of discussion, but the constitutional\r\nright of the President to appoint, control, and remove the head of the\r\nTreasury as well as all other Departments seems to have been universally\r\nconceded. And what is the occasion upon which other principles have been\r\nfirst officially asserted? The Bank of the United States, a great\r\nmoneyed monopoly, had attempted to obtain a renewal of its charter\r\nby controlling the elections of the people and the action of the\r\nGovernment. The use of its corporate funds and power in that attempt\r\nwas fully disclosed, and it was made known to the President that the\r\ncorporation was putting in train the same course of measures, with the\r\nview of making another vigorous effort, through an interference in\r\nthe elections of the people, to control public opinion and force the\r\nGovernment to yield to its demands. This, with its corruption of the\r\npress, its violation of its charter, its exclusion of the Government\r\ndirectors from its proceedings, its neglect of duty and arrogant\r\npretensions, made it, in the opinion of the President, incompatible with\r\nthe public interest and the safety of our institutions that it should\r\nbe longer employed as the fiscal agent of the Treasury. A Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury appointed in the recess of the Senate, who had not been\r\nconfirmed by that body, and whom the President might or might not at\r\nhis pleasure nominate to them, refused to do what his superior in the\r\nexecutive department considered the most imperative of his duties, and\r\nbecame in fact, however innocent his motives, the protector of the bank.\r\nAnd on this occasion it is discovered for the first time that those who\r\nframed the Constitution misunderstood it; that the First Congress and\r\nall its successors have been under a delusion; that the practice of near\r\nforty-five years is but a continued usurpation; that the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury is not responsible to the President, and that to remove him\r\nis a violation of the Constitution and laws for which the President\r\ndeserves to stand forever dishonored on the journals of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThere are also some other circumstances connected with the discussion\r\nand passage of the resolution to which I feel it to be not only my\r\nright, but my duty, to refer. It appears by the Journal of the Senate\r\nthat among the twenty-six Senators who voted for the resolution on its\r\nfinal passage, and who had supported it in debate in its original form,\r\nwere one of the Senators from the State of Maine, the two Senators from\r\nNew Jersey, and one of the Senators from Ohio. It also appears by the\r\nsame Journal and by the files of the Senate that the legislatures of\r\nthese States had severally expressed their opinions in respect to the\r\nExecutive proceedings drawn in question before the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe two branches of the legislature of the State of Maine on the 25th\r\nof January, 1834, passed a preamble and series of resolutions in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Whereas at an early period after the election of Andrew Jackson to the\r\n  Presidency, in accordance with the sentiments which he had uniformly\r\n  expressed, the attention of Congress was called to the constitutionality\r\n  and expediency of the renewal of the charter of the United States Bank;\r\n  and\r\n\r\n  Whereas the bank has transcended its chartered limits in the management\r\n  of its business transactions, and has abandoned the object of its\r\n  creation by engaging in political controversies, by wielding its power\r\n  and influence to embarrass the Administration of the General Government,\r\n  and by bringing insolvency and distress upon the commercial community;\r\n  and\r\n\r\n  Whereas the public security from such an institution consists less in\r\n  its present pecuniary capacity to discharge its liabilities than in the\r\n  fidelity with which the trusts reposed in it have been executed; and\r\n\r\n  Whereas the abuse and misapplication of the powers conferred have\r\n  destroyed the confidence of the public in the officers of the bank and\r\n  demonstrated that such powers endanger the stability of republican\r\n  institutions: Therefore,\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That in the removal of the public deposits from the Bank\r\n  of the United States, as well as in the manner of their removal, we\r\n  recognize in the Administration an adherence to constitutional rights\r\n  and the performance of a public duty.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That this legislature entertain the same opinion as\r\n  heretofore expressed by preceding legislatures of this State, that the\r\n  Bank of the United States ought not to be rechartered.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the Senators of this State in the Congress of the\r\n  United States be instructed and the Representatives be requested to\r\n  oppose the restoration of the deposits and the renewal of the charter\r\n  of the United States Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of January, 1834, the house of assembly and council\r\ncomposing the legislature of the State of New Jersey passed a preamble\r\nand a series of resolutions in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Whereas the present crisis in our public affairs calls for a decided\r\n  expression of the voice of the people of this State; and\r\n\r\n  Whereas we consider it the undoubted right of the legislatures of the\r\n  several States to instruct those who represent their interests in the\r\n  councils of the nation in all matters which intimately concern the\r\n  public weal and may affect the happiness or well-being of the people:\r\n  Therefore,\r\n\r\n  1. _Be it resolved by the council and general assembly of this State_,\r\n  That while we acknowledge with feelings of devout gratitude our\r\n  obligations to the Great Ruler of Nations for His mercies to us as a\r\n  people that we have been preserved alike from foreign war, from the\r\n  evils of internal commotions, and the machinations of designing and\r\n  ambitious men who would prostrate the fair fabric of our Union, that\r\n  we ought nevertheless to humble ourselves in His presence and implore\r\n  His aid for the perpetuation of our republican institutions and for a\r\n  continuance of that unexampled prosperity which our country has hitherto\r\n  enjoyed.\r\n\r\n  2. _Resolved_, That we have undiminished confidence in the integrity and\r\n  firmness of the venerable patriot who now holds the distinguished post\r\n  of Chief Magistrate of this nation, and whose purity of purpose and\r\n  elevated motives have so often received the unqualified approbation of\r\n  a large majority of his fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n  3. _Resolved_, That we view with agitation and alarm the existence of a\r\n  great moneyed incorporation which threatens to embarrass the operations\r\n  of the Government and by means of its unbounded influence upon the\r\n  currency of the country to scatter distress and ruin throughout the\r\n  community, and that we therefore solemnly believe the present Bank of\r\n  the United States ought not to be rechartered.\r\n\r\n  4. _Resolved_, That our Senators in Congress be instructed and our\r\n  members of the House of Representatives be requested to sustain, by\r\n  their votes and influence, the course adopted by the Secretary of the\r\n  Treasury, Mr. Taney, in relation to the Bank of the United States and\r\n  the deposits of the Government moneys, believing as we do the course\r\n  of the Secretary to have been constitutional, and that the public good\r\n  required its adoption.\r\n\r\n  5. _Resolved_, That the governor be requested to forward a copy of the\r\n  above resolutions to each of our Senators and Representatives from this\r\n  State to the Congress of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 21st day of February last the legislature of the same State\r\nreiterated the opinions and instructions before given by joint\r\nresolutions in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Resolved by the council and general assembly of the State of New\r\n  Jersey_, That they do adhere to the resolutions passed by them on the\r\n  11th day of January last, relative to the President of the United\r\n  States, the Bank of the United States, and the course of Mr. Taney\r\n  in removing the Government deposits.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the legislature of New Jersey have not seen any\r\n  reason to depart from such resolutions since the passage thereof,\r\n  and it is their wish that they should receive from our Senators and\r\n  Representatives of this State in the Congress of the United States that\r\n  attention and obedience which are due to the opinion of a sovereign\r\n  State openly expressed in its legislative capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of January, 1834, the senate and house of representatives\r\ncomposing the legislature of Ohio passed a preamble and resolutions in\r\nthe following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Whereas there is reason to believe that the Bank of the United States\r\n  will attempt to obtain a renewal of its charter at the present session\r\n  of Congress; and\r\n\r\n  Whereas it is abundantly evident that said bank has exercised powers\r\n  derogatory to the spirit of our free institutions and dangerous to the\r\n  liberties of these United States; and\r\n\r\n  Whereas there is just reason to doubt the constitutional power of\r\n  Congress to grant acts of incorporation for banking purposes out of\r\n  the District of Columbia; and\r\n\r\n  Whereas we believe the proper disposal of the public lands to be of the\r\n  utmost importance to the people of these United States, and that honor\r\n  and good faith require their equitable distribution: Therefore,\r\n\r\n  _Resolved by the general assembly of the State of Ohio_, That we\r\n  consider the removal of the public deposits from the Bank of the United\r\n  States as required by the best interests of our country, and that a\r\n  proper sense of public duty imperiously demanded that that institution\r\n  should be no longer used as a depository of the public funds.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved also_, That we view with decided disapprobation the renewed\r\n  attempts in Congress to secure the passage of the bill providing for the\r\n  disposal of the public domain upon the principles proposed by Mr. Clay,\r\n  inasmuch as we believe that such a law would be unequal in its\r\n  operations and unjust in its results.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved also_, That we heartily approve of the principles set forth\r\n  in the late veto message upon that subject; and\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That our Senators in Congress be instructed and our\r\n  Representatives requested to use their influence to prevent the\r\n  rechartering of the Bank of the United States, to sustain the\r\n  Administration in its removal of the public deposits, and to oppose the\r\n  passage of a land bill containing the principles adopted in the act upon\r\n  that subject passed at the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the governor be requested to transmit copies of the\r\n  foregoing preamble and resolutions to each of our Senators and\r\n  Representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that four Senators have declared by their votes that the\r\nPresident, in the late Executive proceedings in relation to the revenue,\r\nhad been guilty of the impeachable offense of \"assuming upon himself\r\nauthority and power not conferred by the Constitution and laws, but in\r\nderogation of both,\" whilst the legislatures of their respective States\r\nhad deliberately approved those very proceedings as consistent with the\r\nConstitution and demanded by the public good. If these four votes had\r\nbeen given in accordance with the sentiments of the legislatures, as\r\nabove expressed, there would have been but twenty-two votes out of\r\nforty-six for censuring the President, and the unprecedented record\r\nof his conviction could not have been placed upon the Journal of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nIn thus referring to the resolutions and instructions of the State\r\nlegislatures I disclaim and repudiate all authority or design to\r\ninterfere with the responsibility due from members of the Senate to\r\ntheir own consciences, their constituents, and their country. The facts\r\nnow stated belong to the history of these proceedings, and are important\r\nto the just development of the principles and interests involved in them\r\nas well as to the proper vindication of the executive department, and\r\nwith that view, and that view only, are they here made the topic of\r\nremark.\r\n\r\nThe dangerous tendency of the doctrine which denies to the President\r\nthe power of supervising, directing, and controlling the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury in like manner with the other executive officers would\r\nsoon be manifest in practice were the doctrine to be established. The\r\nPresident is the direct representative of the American people, but the\r\nSecretaries are not. If the Secretary of the Treasury be independent\r\nof the President in the execution of the laws, then is there no direct\r\nresponsibility to the people in that important branch of this Government\r\nto which is committed the care of the national finances. And it is in\r\nthe power of the Bank of the United States, or any other corporation,\r\nbody of men, or individuals, if a Secretary shall be found to accord\r\nwith them in opinion or can be induced in practice to promote their\r\nviews, to control through him the whole action of the Government\r\n(so far as it is exercised by his Department) in defiance of the Chief\r\nMagistrate elected by the people and responsible to them.\r\n\r\nBut the evil tendency of the particular doctrine adverted to, though\r\nsufficiently serious, would be as nothing in comparison with the\r\npernicious consequences which would inevitably flow from the approbation\r\nand allowance by the people and the practice by the Senate of the\r\nunconstitutional power of arraigning and censuring the official conduct\r\nof the Executive in the manner recently pursued. Such proceedings are\r\neminently calculated to unsettle the foundations of the Government, to\r\ndisturb the harmonious action of its different departments, and to break\r\ndown the checks and balances by which the wisdom of its framers sought\r\nto insure its stability and usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe honest differences of opinion which occasionally exist between the\r\nSenate and the President in regard to matters in which both are obliged\r\nto participate are sufficiently embarrassing; but if the course recently\r\nadopted by the Senate shall hereafter be frequently pursued, it is not\r\nonly obvious that the harmony of the relations between the President and\r\nthe Senate will be destroyed, but that other and graver effects will\r\nultimately ensue. If the censures of the Senate be submitted to by the\r\nPresident, the confidence of the people in his ability and virtue and\r\nthe character and usefulness of his Administration will soon be at an\r\nend, and the real power of the Government will fall into the hands of a\r\nbody holding their offices for long terms, not elected by the people and\r\nnot to them directly responsible. If, on the other hand, the illegal\r\ncensures of the Senate should be resisted by the President, collisions\r\nand angry controversies might ensue, discreditable in their progress and\r\nin the end compelling the people to adopt the conclusion either that\r\ntheir Chief Magistrate was unworthy of their respect or that the Senate\r\nwas chargeable with calumny and injustice. Either of these results would\r\nimpair public confidence in the perfection of the system and lead to\r\nserious alterations of its framework or to the practical abandonment of\r\nsome of its provisions.\r\n\r\nThe influence of such proceedings on the other departments of the\r\nGovernment, and more especially on the States, could not fail to be\r\nextensively pernicious. When the judges in the last resort of official\r\nmisconduct themselves overleap the bounds of their authority as\r\nprescribed by the Constitution, what general disregard of its provisions\r\nmight not their example be expected to produce? And who does not\r\nperceive that such contempt of the Federal Constitution by one of its\r\nmost important departments would hold out the strongest temptations to\r\nresistance on the part of the State sovereignties whenever they shall\r\nsuppose their just rights to have been invaded? Thus all the independent\r\ndepartments of the Government, and the States which compose our\r\nconfederated Union, instead of attending to their appropriate duties and\r\nleaving those who may offend to be reclaimed or punished in the manner\r\npointed out in the Constitution, would fall to mutual crimination and\r\nrecrimination and give to the people confusion and anarchy instead of\r\norder and law, until at length some form of aristocratic power would be\r\nestablished on the ruins of the Constitution or the States be broken\r\ninto separate communities.\r\n\r\nFar be it from me to charge or to insinuate that the present Senate of\r\nthe United States intend in the most distant way to encourage such a\r\nresult. It is not of their motives or designs, but only of the tendency\r\nof their acts, that it is my duty to speak. It is, if possible, to\r\nmake Senators themselves sensible of the danger which lurks under the\r\nprecedent set in their resolution, and at any rate to perform my duty\r\nas the responsible head of one of the coequal departments of the\r\nGovernment, that I have been compelled to point out the consequences\r\nto which the discussion and passage of the resolution may lead if the\r\ntendency of the measure be not checked in its inception. It is due to\r\nthe high trust with which I have been charged, to those who may be\r\ncalled to succeed me in it, to the representatives of the people whose\r\nconstitutional prerogative has been unlawfully assumed, to the people\r\nand to the States, and to the Constitution they have established that\r\nI should not permit its provisions to be broken down by such an attack\r\non the executive department without at least some effort \"to preserve,\r\nprotect, and defend\" them. With this view, and for the reasons which\r\nhave been stated, I do hereby _solemnly protest_ against the\r\naforementioned proceedings of the Senate as unauthorized by the\r\nConstitution, contrary to its spirit and to several of its express\r\nprovisions, subversive of that distribution of the powers of government\r\nwhich it has ordained and established, destructive of the checks and\r\nsafeguards by which those powers were intended on the one hand to be\r\ncontrolled and on the other to be protected, and calculated by their\r\nimmediate and collateral effects, by their character and tendency, to\r\nconcentrate in the hands of a body not directly amenable to the people\r\na degree of influence and power dangerous to their liberties and fatal\r\nto the Constitution of their choice.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the Senate contains an imputation upon my private as\r\nwell as upon my public character, and as it must stand forever on their\r\njournals, I can not close this substitute for that defense which I have\r\nnot been allowed to present in the ordinary form without remarking\r\nthat I have lived in vain if it be necessary to enter into a formal\r\nvindication of my character and purposes from such an imputation. In\r\nvain do I bear upon my person enduring memorials of that contest in\r\nwhich American liberty was purchased; in vain have I since periled\r\nproperty, fame, and life in defense of the rights and privileges so\r\ndearly bought; in vain am I now, without a personal aspiration or the\r\nhope of individual advantage, encountering responsibilities and dangers\r\nfrom which by mere inactivity in relation to a single point I might have\r\nbeen exempt, if any serious doubts can be entertained as to the purity\r\nof my purposes and motives. If I had been ambitious, I should have\r\nsought an alliance with that powerful institution which even now aspires\r\nto no divided empire. If I had been venal, I should have sold myself to\r\nits designs. Had I preferred personal comfort and official ease to the\r\nperformance of my arduous duty, I should have ceased to molest it. In\r\nthe history of conquerors and usurpers, never in the fire of youth nor\r\nin the vigor of manhood could I find an attraction to lure me from the\r\npath of duty, and now I shall scarcely find an inducement to commence\r\ntheir career of ambition when gray hairs and a decaying frame, instead\r\nof inviting to toil and battle, call me to the contemplation of other\r\nworlds, where conquerors cease to be honored and usurpers expiate their\r\ncrimes. The only ambition I can feel is to acquit myself to Him to whom\r\nI must soon render an account of my stewardship, to serve my fellow-men,\r\nand live respected and honored in the history of my country. No;\r\nthe ambition which leads me on is an anxious desire and a fixed\r\ndetermination to return to the people unimpaired the sacred trust they\r\nhave confided to my charge; to heal the wounds of the Constitution and\r\npreserve it from further violation; to persuade my countrymen, so far\r\nas I may, that it is not in a splendid government supported by powerful\r\nmonopolies and aristocratical establishments that they will find\r\nhappiness or their liberties protection, but in a plain system, void\r\nof pomp, protecting all and granting favors to none, dispensing its\r\nblessings, like the dews of Heaven, unseen and unfelt save in the\r\nfreshness and beauty they contribute to produce. It is such a government\r\nthat the genius of our people requires; such an one only under which our\r\nStates may remain for ages to come united, prosperous, and free. If\r\nthe Almighty Being who has hitherto sustained and protected me will\r\nbut vouchsafe to make my feeble powers instrumental to such a result,\r\nI shall anticipate with pleasure the place to be assigned me in the\r\nhistory of my country, and die contented with the belief that I have\r\ncontributed in some small degree to increase the value and prolong the\r\nduration of American liberty.\r\n\r\nTo the end that the resolution of the Senate may not be hereafter\r\ndrawn into precedent with the authority of silent acquiescence on the\r\npart of the executive department, and to the end also that my motives\r\nand views in the Executive proceedings denounced in that resolution may\r\nbe known to my fellow-citizens, to the world, and to all posterity, I\r\nrespectfully request that this message and protest may be entered at\r\nlength on the journals of the Senate.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 21, 1834.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHaving reason to believe that certain passages contained in my message\r\nand protest transmitted to the Senate on the 17th [15th] instant may be\r\nmisunderstood, I think it proper to state that it was not my intention\r\nto deny in the said message the power and right of the legislative\r\ndepartment to provide by law for the custody, safe-keeping, and\r\ndisposition of the public money and property of the United States.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am well satisfied that such a construction is not warranted\r\nby anything contained in that message, yet aware from experience that\r\ndetached passages of an argumentative document, when disconnected from\r\ntheir context and considered without reference to previous limitations\r\nand the particular positions they were intended to refute or to\r\nestablish, may be made to bear a construction varying altogether from\r\nthe sentiments really entertained and intended to be expressed, and\r\ndeeply solicitous that my views on this point should not, either now or\r\nhereafter, be misapprehended, I have deemed it due to the gravity of\r\nthe subject, to the great interests it involves, and to the Senate\r\nas well as to myself to embrace the earliest opportunity to make this\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nI admit without reserve, as I have before done, the constitutional power\r\nof the Legislature to prescribe by law the place or places in which the\r\npublic money or other property is to be deposited, and to make such\r\nregulations concerning its custody, removal, or disposition as they may\r\nthink proper to enact. Nor do I claim for the Executive any right to\r\nthe possession or disposition of the public property or treasure or\r\nany authority to interfere with the same, except when such possession,\r\ndisposition, or authority is given to him by law. Nor do I claim the\r\nright in any manner to supervise or interfere with the person intrusted\r\nwith such property or treasure, unless he be an officer whose\r\nappointment, under the Constitution and laws, is devolved upon the\r\nPresident alone or in conjunction with the Senate, and for whose conduct\r\nhe is constitutionally responsible.\r\n\r\nAs the message and protest referred to may appear on the Journal of\r\nthe Senate and remain among the recorded documents of the nation,\r\nI am unwilling that opinions should be imputed to me, even through\r\nmisconstruction, which are not entertained, and more particularly\r\nam I solicitous that I may not be supposed to claim for myself or\r\nmy successors any power or authority not clearly granted by the\r\nConstitution and laws to the President. I have therefore respectfully to\r\nrequest that this communication may be considered a part of that message\r\nand that it may be entered therewith on the journals of the Senate.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, June 21, 1834_.\r\n\r\nORDER 46.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Major-General Commanding the Army has received through the War\r\nDepartment the following General Order from the President of the United\r\nStates:\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 21, 1834_.\r\n\r\nInformation having been received of the death of General Lafayette,\r\nthe President considers it due to his own feelings as well as to the\r\ncharacter and services of that lamented man to announce the event to\r\nthe Army and Navy.\r\n\r\nLafayette was a citizen of France, but he was the distinguished friend\r\nof the United States. In early life he embarked in that contest which\r\nsecured freedom and independence to our country. His services and\r\nsacrifices constitute a part of our Revolutionary history, and his\r\nmemory will be second only to that of Washington in the hearts of the\r\nAmerican people. In his own country and in ours he was the zealous and\r\nuniform friend and advocate of rational liberty. Consistent in his\r\nprinciples and conduct, he never during a long life committed an act\r\nwhich exposed him to just accusation or which will expose his memory\r\nto reproach. Living at a period of great excitement and of moral and\r\npolitical revolutions, engaged in many of the important events which\r\nfixed the attention of the world, and invited to guide the destinies of\r\nFrance at two of the most momentous eras of her history, his political\r\nintegrity and personal disinterestedness have not been called in\r\nquestion. Happy in such a life, he has been happy in his death. He\r\nhas been taken from the theater of action with faculties unimpaired,\r\nwith a reputation unquestioned, and an object of veneration wherever\r\ncivilization and the rights of man have extended; and mourning, as we\r\nmay and must, his departure, let us rejoice that this associate of\r\nWashington has gone, as we humbly hope, to rejoin his illustrious\r\ncommander in the fullness of days and of honor.\r\n\r\nHe came in his youth to defend our country. He came in the maturity of\r\nhis age to witness her growth in all the elements of prosperity, and\r\nwhile witnessing these he received those testimonials of national\r\ngratitude which proved how strong was his hold upon the affections of\r\nthe American people.\r\n\r\nOne melancholy duty remains to be performed. The last major-general of\r\nthe Revolutionary army has died. Himself a young and humble participator\r\nin the struggles of that period, the President feels called on as well\r\nby personal as public considerations to direct that appropriate honors\r\nbe paid to the memory of this distinguished patriot and soldier. He\r\ntherefore orders that the same honors be rendered upon this occasion at\r\nthe different military and naval stations as were observed upon the\r\ndecease of Washington, the Father of his Country, and his contemporary\r\nin arms.\r\n\r\nIn ordering this homage to be paid to the memory of one so eminent in\r\nthe field, so wise in council, so endeared in private life, and so well\r\nand favorably known to both hemispheres the President feels assured that\r\nhe is anticipating the sentiments not of the Army and Navy only, but of\r\nthe whole American people.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the commands of the President, the following funeral\r\nhonors will be paid at the several stations of the Army:\r\n\r\nAt daybreak twenty-four guns will be fired in quick succession, and one\r\ngun at the interval of every half hour thereafter till sunset.\r\n\r\nThe flags of the several stations will during the day be at half-mast.\r\nThe officers of the Army will wear crape on the left arm for the period\r\nof six months.\r\n\r\nThis order will be carried into effect under the direction of the\r\ncommanding officer of each post and station the day after its reception.\r\n\r\nBy command of Major-General Macomb, commanding in chief:\r\n\r\nR. JONES,\r\n\r\n_Adjutant-General_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN HILL, _October 12, 1834_.\r\n\r\nHon. LEVI WOODBURY,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of the Treasury_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: I inclose you two letters from two of our most respectable\r\ncitizens. They are good men and true. The letters relate to matters\r\nunder your immediate charge, and when I come on to Washington will see\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nMarshall was our candidate for the legislature, and has no doubt lost\r\nhis election through the influence of the United States officers at that\r\npost, who are all of them opposed to us, and if we lose _Brown_ this\r\nwinter from the Senate it will be owing mainly and chiefly to this.\r\nThe county of Carterett sends three members to the legislature, and is\r\nJackson to the _hub_; but Major Kirby, who commands at Fort Macon, has\r\nused his influence in conjunction with D. Borden, who finds the troops\r\nwith provisions, in favor of the opposition, and have beaten our men by\r\nsmall majorities. The troops, it seems, were paid off in Virginia money,\r\nwhich is below _par_ in our State, and this just on the eve of the\r\nelection, and hence you may see the turn that was given to the matter.\r\nDr. Hunt, who wishes to be appointed surgeon at Occracock, is a fine\r\nman, and I should like for him to have it; but of these matters more\r\nwhen I see you.\r\n\r\nYou see our new bank has gone into operation. Suppose you open a\r\ncorrespondence [with] them about the matter we have been talking about.\r\nIt is _all important_ that this matter should be attended to. With\r\nsentiments of great respect, I am, dear sir, yours, etc.,\r\n\r\nJ. SPEIGHT.\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nLet a strict inquiry be had into the conduct of the officers\r\ncomplained of, and particularly why the paymaster has paid the troops in\r\ndepreciated paper when he could as easily paid them in specie. It is his\r\nduty in all cases so to do, as all the revenue is specie and all public\r\ndues are payable in specie.\r\n\r\nA.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 1, 1834.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn performing my duty at the opening of your present session it gives me\r\npleasure to congratulate you again upon the prosperous condition of our\r\nbeloved country. Divine Providence has favored us with general health,\r\nwith rich rewards in the fields of agriculture and in every branch of\r\nlabor, and with peace to cultivate and extend the various resources\r\nwhich employ the virtue and enterprise of our citizens. Let us trust\r\nthat in surveying a scene so flattering to our free institutions our\r\njoint deliberations to preserve them may be crowned with success.\r\n\r\nOur foreign relations continue, with but few exceptions, to maintain the\r\nfavorable aspect which they bore in my last annual message, and promise\r\nto extend those advantages which the principles that regulate our\r\nintercourse with other nations are so well calculated to secure.\r\n\r\nThe question of the northeastern boundary is still pending with Great\r\nBritain, and the proposition made in accordance with the resolution of\r\nthe Senate for the establishment of a line according to the treaty of\r\n1783 has not been accepted by that Government. Believing that every\r\ndisposition is felt on both sides to adjust this perplexing question to\r\nthe satisfaction of all the parties interested in it, the hope is yet\r\nindulged that it may be effected on the basis of that proposition.\r\n\r\nWith the Governments of Austria, Russia, Prussia, Holland, Sweden, and\r\nDenmark the best understanding exists. Commerce with all is fostered and\r\nprotected by reciprocal good will under the sanction of liberal\r\nconventional or legal provisions.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her internal difficulties the Queen of Spain has\r\nratified the convention for the payment of the claims of our citizens\r\narising since 1819. It is in the course of execution on her part, and a\r\ncopy of it is now laid before you for such legislation as may be found\r\nnecessary to enable those interested to derive the benefits of it.\r\n\r\nYielding to the force of circumstances and to the wise counsels of time\r\nand experience, that power has finally resolved no longer to occupy the\r\nunnatural position in which she stood to the new Governments established\r\nin this hemisphere. I have the great satisfaction of stating to you that\r\nin preparing the way for the restoration of harmony between those who\r\nhave sprung from the same ancestors, who are allied by common interests,\r\nprofess the same religion, and speak the same language the United States\r\nhave been actively instrumental. Our efforts to effect this good work\r\nwill be persevered in while they are deemed useful to the parties and\r\nour entire disinterestedness continues to be felt and understood. The\r\nact of Congress to countervail the discriminating duties to the\r\nprejudice of our navigation levied in Cuba and Puerto Rico has been\r\ntransmitted to the minister of the United States at Madrid, to be\r\ncommunicated to the Government of the Queen. No intelligence of its\r\nreceipt has yet reached the Department of State. If the present\r\ncondition of the country permits the Government to make a careful and\r\nenlarged examination of the true interests of these important portions\r\nof its dominions, no doubt is entertained that their future intercourse\r\nwith the United States will be placed upon a more just and liberal\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\nThe Florida archives have not yet been selected and delivered. Recent\r\norders have been sent to the agent of the United States at Havana to\r\nreturn with all that he can obtain, so that they may be in Washington\r\nbefore the session of the Supreme Court, to be used in the legal\r\nquestions there pending to which the Government is a party.\r\n\r\nInternal tranquillity is happily restored to Portugal. The distracted\r\nstate of the country rendered unavoidable the postponement of a final\r\npayment of the just claims of our citizens. Our diplomatic relations\r\nwill be soon resumed, and the long-subsisting friendship with that power\r\naffords the strongest guaranty that the balance due will receive prompt\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe first installment due under the convention of indemnity with the\r\nKing of the Two Sicilies has been duly received, and an offer has been\r\nmade to extinguish the whole by a prompt payment--an offer I did not\r\nconsider myself authorized to accept, as the indemnification provided\r\nis the exclusive property of individual citizens of the United States.\r\nThe original adjustment of our claims and the anxiety displayed to\r\nfulfill at once the stipulations made for the payment of them are highly\r\nhonorable to the Government of the Two Sicilies. When it is recollected\r\nthat they were the result of the injustice of an intrusive power\r\ntemporarily dominant in its territory, a repugnance to acknowledge and\r\nto pay which would have been neither unnatural nor unexpected, the\r\ncircumstances can not fail to exalt its character for justice and good\r\nfaith in the eyes of all nations.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of amity and commerce between the United States and Belgium,\r\nbrought to your notice in my last annual message as sanctioned by the\r\nSenate, but the ratifications of which had not been exchanged owing\r\nto a delay in its reception at Brussels and a subsequent absence\r\nof the Belgian minister of foreign affairs, has been, after mature\r\ndeliberation, finally disavowed by that Government as inconsistent\r\nwith the powers and instructions given to their minister who negotiated\r\nit. This disavowal was entirely unexpected, as the liberal principles\r\nembodied in the convention, and which form the groundwork of the\r\nobjections to it, were perfectly satisfactory to the Belgian\r\nrepresentative, and were supposed to be not only within the powers\r\ngranted, but expressly conformable to the instructions given to him.\r\nAn offer, not yet accepted, has been made by Belgium to renew\r\nnegotiations for a treaty less liberal in its provisions on questions\r\nof general maritime law.\r\n\r\nOur newly established relations with the Sublime Porte promise to\r\nbe useful to our commerce and satisfactory in every respect to this\r\nGovernment. Our intercourse with the Barbary Powers continues without\r\nimportant change, except that the present political state of Algiers has\r\ninduced me to terminate the residence there of a salaried consul and\r\nto substitute an ordinary consulate, to remain so long as the place\r\ncontinues in the possession of France. Our first treaty with one of\r\nthese powers, the Emperor of Morocco, was formed in 1786, and was\r\nlimited to fifty years. That period has almost expired. I shall take\r\nmeasures to renew it with the greater satisfaction as its stipulations\r\nare just and liberal and have been, with mutual fidelity and reciprocal\r\nadvantage, scrupulously fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIntestine dissensions have too frequently occurred to mar the\r\nprosperity, interrupt the commerce, and distract the governments of most\r\nof the nations of this hemisphere which have separated themselves from\r\nSpain. When a firm and permanent understanding with the parent country\r\nshall have produced a formal acknowledgment of their independence, and\r\nthe idea of danger from that quarter can be no longer entertained, the\r\nfriends of freedom expect that those countries, so favored by nature,\r\nwill be distinguished for their love of justice and their devotion\r\nto those peaceful arts the assiduous cultivation of which confers\r\nhonor upon nations and gives value to human life. In the meantime\r\nI confidently hope that the apprehensions entertained that some of\r\nthe people of these luxuriant regions may be tempted, in a moment of\r\nunworthy distrust of their own capacity for the enjoyment of liberty, to\r\ncommit the too common error of purchasing present repose by bestowing\r\non some favorite leaders the fatal gift of irresponsible power will\r\nnot be realized. With all these Governments and with that of Brazil no\r\nunexpected changes in our relations have occurred during the present\r\nyear. Frequent causes of just complaint have arisen upon the part of the\r\ncitizens of the United States, sometimes from the irregular action of\r\nthe constituted subordinate authorities of the maritime regions and\r\nsometimes from the leaders or partisans of those in arms against the\r\nestablished Governments. In all cases representations have been or\r\nwill be made, and as soon as their political affairs are in a settled\r\nposition it is expected that our friendly remonstrances will be\r\nfollowed by adequate redress.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Mexico made known in December last the appointment\r\nof commissioners and a surveyor on its part to run, in conjunction with\r\nours, the boundary line between its territories and the United States,\r\nand excused the delay for the reasons anticipated--the prevalence of\r\ncivil war. The commissioners and surveyors not having met within the\r\ntime stipulated by the treaty, a new arrangement became necessary,\r\nand our chargé d'affaires was instructed in January last to negotiate\r\nin Mexico an article additional to the preexisting treaty. This\r\ninstruction was acknowledged, and no difficulty was apprehended in\r\nthe accomplishment of that object. By information just received that\r\nadditional article to the treaty will be obtained and transmitted to\r\nthis country as soon as it can receive the ratification of the Mexican\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe reunion of the three States of New Grenada, Venezuela, and Equador,\r\nforming the Republic of Colombia, seems every day to become more\r\nimprobable. The commissioners of the two first are understood to be now\r\nnegotiating a just division of the obligations contracted by them when\r\nunited under one government. The civil war in Equador, it is believed,\r\nhas prevented even the appointment of a commissioner on its part.\r\n\r\nI propose at an early day to submit, in the proper form, the appointment\r\nof a diplomatic agent to Venezuela, the importance of the commerce of\r\nthat country to the United States and the large claims of our citizens\r\nupon the Government arising before and since the division of Colombia\r\nrendering it, in my judgment, improper longer to delay this step.\r\n\r\nOur representatives to Central America, Peru, and Brazil are either at\r\nor on their way to their respective posts.\r\n\r\nFrom the Argentine Republic, from which a minister was expected to this\r\nGovernment, nothing further has been heard. Occasion has been taken on\r\nthe departure of a new consul to Buenos Ayres to remind that Government\r\nthat its long-delayed minister, whose appointment had been made known to\r\nus, had not arrived.\r\n\r\nIt becomes my unpleasant duty to inform you that this pacific and highly\r\ngratifying picture of our foreign relations does not include those with\r\nFrance at this time. It is not possible that any Government and people\r\ncould be more sincerely desirous of conciliating a just and friendly\r\nintercourse with another nation than are those of the United States\r\nwith their ancient ally and friend. This disposition is founded as well\r\non the most grateful and honorable recollections associated with our\r\nstruggle for independence as upon a well-grounded conviction that it is\r\nconsonant with the true policy of both. The people of the United States\r\ncould not, therefore, see without the deepest regret even a temporary\r\ninterruption of the friendly relations between the two countries--a\r\nregret which would, I am sure, be greatly aggravated if there should\r\nturn out to be any reasonable ground for attributing such a result to\r\nany act of omission or commission on our part. I derive, therefore, the\r\nhighest satisfaction from being able to assure you that the whole course\r\nof this Government has been characterized by a spirit so conciliatory\r\nand forbearing as to make it impossible that our justice and moderation\r\nshould be questioned, whatever may be the consequences of a longer\r\nperseverance on the part of the French Government in her omission to\r\nsatisfy the conceded claims of our citizens.\r\n\r\nThe history of the accumulated and unprovoked aggressions upon our\r\ncommerce committed by authority of the existing Governments of France\r\nbetween the years 1800 and 1817 has been rendered too painfully familiar\r\nto Americans to make its repetition either necessary or desirable. It\r\nwill be sufficient here to remark that there has for many years been\r\nscarcely a single administration of the French Government by whom the\r\njustice and legality of the claims of our citizens to indemnity were\r\nnot to a very considerable extent admitted, and yet near a quarter of\r\na century has been wasted in ineffectual negotiations to secure it.\r\n\r\nDeeply sensible of the injurious effects resulting from this state of\r\nthings upon the interests and character of both nations, I regarded it\r\nas among my first duties to cause one more effort to be made to satisfy\r\nFrance that a just and liberal settlement of our claims was as well due\r\nto her own honor as to their incontestable validity. The negotiation for\r\nthis purpose was commenced with the late Government of France, and was\r\nprosecuted with such success as to leave no reasonable ground to doubt\r\nthat a settlement of a character quite as liberal as that which was\r\nsubsequently made would have been effected had not the revolution by\r\nwhich the negotiation was cut off taken place. The discussions were\r\nresumed with the present Government, and the result showed that we\r\nwere not wrong in supposing that an event by which the two Governments\r\nwere made to approach each other so much nearer in their political\r\nprinciples, and by which the motives for the most liberal and friendly\r\nintercourse were so greatly multiplied, could exercise no other than a\r\nsalutary influence upon the negotiation. After the most deliberate and\r\nthorough examination of the whole subject a treaty between the two\r\nGovernments was concluded and signed at Paris on the 4th of July, 1831,\r\nby which it was stipulated that \"the French Government, in order to\r\nliberate itself from all the reclamations preferred against it by\r\ncitizens of the United States for unlawful seizures, captures,\r\nsequestrations, confiscations, or destruction of their vessels, cargoes,\r\nor other property, engages to pay a sum of 25,000,000 francs to the\r\nUnited States, who shall distribute it among those entitled in the\r\nmanner and according to the rules it shall determine;\" and it was also\r\nstipulated on the part of the French Government that this 25,000,000\r\nfrancs should \"be paid at Paris, in six annual installments of 4,166,666\r\nfrancs and 66 centimes each, into the hands of such person or persons as\r\nshall be authorized by the Government of the United States to receive\r\nit,\" the first installment to be paid \"at the expiration of one year\r\nnext following the exchange of the ratifications of this convention and\r\nthe others at successive intervals of a year, one after another, till\r\nthe whole shall be paid. To the amount of each of the said installments\r\nshall be added interest at 4 per cent thereupon, as upon the other\r\ninstallments then remaining unpaid, the said interest to be computed\r\nfrom the day of the exchange of the present convention.\"\r\n\r\nIt was also stipulated on the part of the United States, for the\r\npurpose of being completely liberated from all the reclamations\r\npresented by France on behalf of its citizens, that the sum of 1,500,000\r\nfrancs should be paid to the Government of France in six annual\r\ninstallments, to be deducted out of the annual sums which France had\r\nagreed to pay, interest thereupon being in like manner computed from\r\nthe day of the exchange of the ratifications. In addition to this\r\nstipulation, important advantages were secured to France by the\r\nfollowing article, viz:\r\n\r\nThe wines of France, from and after the exchange of the ratifications of\r\nthe present convention, shall be admitted to consumption in the States\r\nof the Union at duties which shall not exceed the following rates by the\r\ngallon (such as it is used at present for wines in the United States),\r\nto wit: 6 cents for red wines in casks; 10 cents for white wines in\r\ncasks, and 22 cents for wines of all sorts in bottles. The proportions\r\nexisting between the duties on French wines thus reduced and the general\r\nrates of the tariff which went into operation the 1st January, 1829,\r\nshall be maintained in case the Government of the United States should\r\nthink proper to diminish those general rates in a new tariff.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of this stipulation, which shall be binding on\r\nthe United States for ten years, the French Government abandons the\r\nreclamations which it had formed in relation to the eighth article of\r\nthe treaty of cession of Louisiana. It engages, moreover, to establish\r\non the _long-staple_ cottons of the United States which after the\r\nexchange of the ratifications of the present convention shall be brought\r\ndirectly thence to France by the vessels of the United States or by\r\nFrench vessels the same duties as on _short-staple_ cottons.\r\n\r\nThis treaty was duly ratified in the manner prescribed by the\r\nconstitutions of both countries, and the ratification was exchanged\r\nat the city of Washington on the 2d of February, 1832. On account of\r\nits commercial stipulations it was in five days thereafter laid before\r\nthe Congress of the United States, which proceeded to enact such laws\r\nfavorable to the commerce of France as were necessary to carry it into\r\nfull execution, and France has from that period to the present been in\r\nthe unrestricted enjoyment of the valuable privileges that were thus\r\nsecured to her. The faith of the French nation having been thus solemnly\r\npledged through its constitutional organ for the liquidation and\r\nultimate payment of the long-deferred claims of our citizens, as also\r\nfor the adjustment of other points of great and reciprocal benefits\r\nto both countries, and the United States having, with a fidelity\r\nand promptitude by which their conduct will, I trust, be always\r\ncharacterized, done everything that was necessary to carry the treaty\r\ninto full and fair effect on their part, counted with the most perfect\r\nconfidence on equal fidelity and promptitude on the part of the French\r\nGovernment. In this reasonable expectation we have been, I regret to\r\ninform you, wholly disappointed. No legislative provision has been made\r\nby France for the execution of the treaty, either as it respects the\r\nindemnity to be paid or the commercial benefits to be secured to the\r\nUnited States, and the relations between the United States and that\r\npower in consequence thereof are placed in a situation threatening to\r\ninterrupt the good understanding which has so long and so happily\r\nexisted between the two nations.\r\n\r\nNot only has the French Government been thus wanting in the performance\r\nof the stipulations it has so solemnly entered into with the United\r\nStates, but its omissions have been marked by circumstances which would\r\nseem to leave us without satisfactory evidences that such performance\r\nwill certainly take place at a future period. Advice of the exchange of\r\nratifications reached Paris prior to the 8th April, 1832. The French\r\nChambers were then sitting, and continued in session until the 21st of\r\nthat month, and although one installment of the indemnity was payable on\r\nthe 2d of February, 1833, one year after the exchange of ratifications,\r\nno application was made to the Chambers for the required appropriation,\r\nand in consequence of no appropriation having then been made the draft\r\nof the United States Government for that installment was dishonored by\r\nthe minister of finance, and the United States thereby involved in\r\nmuch controversy. The next session of the Chambers commenced on\r\nthe 19th November, 1832, and continued until the 25th April, 1833.\r\nNotwithstanding the omission to pay the first installment had been made\r\nthe subject of earnest remonstrance on our part, the treaty with the\r\nUnited States and a bill making the necessary appropriations to execute\r\nit were not laid before the Chamber of Deputies until the 6th of April,\r\nnearly five months after its meeting, and only nineteen days before the\r\nclose of the session. The bill was read and referred to a committee, but\r\nthere was no further action upon it. The next session of the Chambers\r\ncommenced on the 26th of April, 1833, and continued until the 26th of\r\nJune following. A new bill was introduced on the 11th of June, but\r\nnothing important was done in relation to it during the session. In the\r\nmonth of April, 1834, nearly three years after the signature of the\r\ntreaty, the final action of the French Chambers upon the bill to carry\r\nthe treaty into effect was obtained, and resulted in a refusal of the\r\nnecessary appropriations. The avowed grounds upon which the bill was\r\nrejected are to be found in the published debates of that body, and\r\nno observations of mine can be necessary to satisfy Congress of their\r\nutter insufficiency. Although the gross amount of the claims of our\r\ncitizens is probably greater than will be ultimately allowed by the\r\ncommissioners, sufficient is, nevertheless, shown to render it\r\nabsolutely certain that the indemnity falls far short of the actual\r\namount of our just claims, independently of the question of damages and\r\ninterest for the detention. That the settlement involved a sacrifice\r\nin this respect was well known at the time--a sacrifice which was\r\ncheerfully acquiesced in by the different branches of the Federal\r\nGovernment, whose action upon the treaty was required from a sincere\r\ndesire to avoid further collision upon this old and disturbing subject\r\nand in the confident expectation that the general relations between the\r\ntwo countries would be improved thereby.\r\n\r\nThe refusal to vote the appropriation, the news of which was received\r\nfrom our minister in Paris about the 15th day of May last, might have\r\nbeen considered the final determination of the French Government not\r\nto execute the stipulations of the treaty, and would have justified an\r\nimmediate communication of the facts to Congress, with a recommendation\r\nof such ultimate measures as the interest and honor of the United States\r\nmight seem to require. But with the news of the refusal of the Chambers\r\nto make the appropriation were conveyed the regrets of the King and a\r\ndeclaration that a national vessel should be forthwith sent out with\r\ninstructions to the French minister to give the most ample explanations\r\nof the past and the strongest assurances for the future. After a long\r\npassage the promised dispatch vessel arrived. The pledges given by the\r\nFrench minister upon receipt of his instructions were that as soon\r\nafter the election of the new members as the charter would permit\r\nthe legislative Chambers of France should be called together and\r\nthe proposition for an appropriation laid before them; that all the\r\nconstitutional powers of the King and his cabinet should be exerted to\r\naccomplish the object, and that the result should be made known early\r\nenough to be communicated to Congress at the commencement of the\r\npresent session. Relying upon these pledges, and not doubting that the\r\nacknowledged justice of our claims, the promised exertions of the King\r\nand his cabinet, and, above all, that sacred regard for the national\r\nfaith and honor for which the French character has been so distinguished\r\nwould secure an early execution of the treaty in all its parts, I did\r\nnot deem it necessary to call the attention of Congress to the subject\r\nat the last session.\r\n\r\nI regret to say that the pledges made through the minister of France\r\nhave not been redeemed. The new Chambers met on the 3its July last, and\r\nalthough the subject of fulfilling treaties was alluded to in the speech\r\nfrom the throne, no attempt was made by the King or his cabinet to\r\nprocure an appropriation to carry it into execution. The reasons given\r\nfor this omission, although they might be considered sufficient in an\r\nordinary case, are not consistent with the expectations founded upon the\r\nassurances given here, for there is no constitutional obstacle to\r\nentering into legislative business at the first meeting of the Chambers.\r\nThis point, however, might have been overlooked had not the Chambers,\r\ninstead of being called to meet at so early a day that the result of\r\ntheir deliberations might be communicated to me before the meeting of\r\nCongress, been prorogued to the 29th of the present month--a period so\r\nlate that their decision can scarcely be made known to the present\r\nCongress prior to its dissolution. To avoid this delay our minister in\r\nParis, in virtue of the assurance given by the French minister in the\r\nUnited States, strongly urged the convocation of the Chambers at an\r\nearlier day, but without success. It is proper to remark, however, that\r\nthis refusal has been accompanied with the most positive assurances on\r\nthe part of the executive government of France of their intention to\r\npress the appropriation at the ensuing session of the Chambers.\r\n\r\nThe executive branch of this Government has, as matters stand, exhausted\r\nall the authority upon the subject with which it is invested and which\r\nit had any reason to believe could be beneficially employed.\r\n\r\nThe idea of acquiescing in the refusal to execute the treaty will not,\r\nI am confident, be for a moment entertained by any branch of this\r\nGovernment, and further negotiation upon the subject is equally out of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nIf it shall be the pleasure of Congress to await the further action\r\nof the French Chambers, no further consideration of the subject will\r\nat this session probably be required at your hands. But if from the\r\noriginal delay in asking for an appropriation, from the refusal of the\r\nChambers to grant it when asked, from the omission to bring the subject\r\nbefore the Chambers at their last session, from the fact that, including\r\nthat session, there have been five different occasions when the\r\nappropriation might have been made, and from the delay in convoking the\r\nChambers until some weeks after the meeting of Congress, when it was\r\nwell known that a communication of the whole subject to Congress at the\r\nlast session was prevented by assurances that it should be disposed of\r\nbefore its present meeting, you should feel yourselves constrained to\r\ndoubt whether it be the intention of the French Government, in all its\r\nbranches, to carry the treaty into effect, and think that such measures\r\nas the occasion may be deemed to call for should be now adopted, the\r\nimportant question arises what those measures shall be.\r\n\r\nOur institutions are essentially pacific. Peace and friendly intercourse\r\nwith all nations are as much the desire of our Government as they are\r\nthe interest of our people. But these objects are not to be permanently\r\nsecured by surrendering the rights of our citizens or permitting solemn\r\ntreaties for their indemnity, in cases of flagrant wrong, to be\r\nabrogated or set aside.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly in the power of Congress seriously to affect the\r\nagricultural and manufacturing interests of France by the passage\r\nof laws relating to her trade with the United States. Her products,\r\nmanufactures, and tonnage may be subjected to heavy duties in our ports,\r\nor all commercial intercourse with her may be suspended. But there\r\nare powerful and to my mind conclusive objections to this mode of\r\nproceeding. We can not embarrass or cut off the trade of France without\r\nat the same time in some degree embarrassing or cutting off our own\r\ntrade. The injury of such a warfare must fall, though unequally, upon\r\nour own citizens, and could not but impair the means of the Government\r\nand weaken that united sentiment in support of the rights and honor of\r\nthe nation which must now pervade every bosom. Nor is it impossible that\r\nsuch a course of legislation would introduce once more into our national\r\ncouncils those disturbing questions in relation to the tariff of duties\r\nwhich have been so recently put to rest. Besides, by every measure\r\nadopted by the Government of the United States with the view of injuring\r\nFrance the clear perception of right which will induce our own people\r\nand the rulers and people of all other nations, even of France herself,\r\nto pronounce our quarrel just will be obscured and the support rendered\r\nto us in a final resort to more decisive measures will be more limited\r\nand equivocal. There is but one point in the controversy, and upon that\r\nthe whole civilized world must pronounce France to be in the wrong. We\r\ninsist that she shall pay us a sum of money which she has acknowledged\r\nto be due, and of the justice of this demand there can be but one\r\nopinion among mankind. True policy would seem to dictate that the\r\nquestion at issue should be kept thus disencumbered and that not the\r\nslightest pretense should be given to France to persist in her refusal\r\nto make payment by any act on our part affecting the interests of her\r\npeople. The question should be left, as it is now, in such an attitude\r\nthat when France fulfills her treaty stipulations all controversy will\r\nbe at an end.\r\n\r\nIt is my conviction that the United States ought to insist on a prompt\r\nexecution of the treaty, and in case it be refused or longer delayed\r\ntake redress into their own hands. After the delay on the part of France\r\nof a quarter of a century in acknowledging these claims by treaty, it is\r\nnot to be tolerated that another quarter of a century is to be wasted in\r\nnegotiating about the payment. The laws of nations provide a remedy for\r\nsuch occasions. It is a well-settled principle of the international code\r\nthat where one nation owes another a liquidated debt which it refuses or\r\nneglects to pay the aggrieved party may seize on the property belonging\r\nto the other, its citizens or subjects, sufficient to pay the debt\r\nwithout giving just cause of war. This remedy has been repeatedly\r\nresorted to, and recently by France herself toward Portugal, under\r\ncircumstances less unquestionable.\r\n\r\nThe time at which resort should be had to this or any other mode of\r\nredress is a point to be decided by Congress. If an appropriation shall\r\nnot be made by the French Chambers at their next session, it may justly\r\nbe concluded that the Government of France has finally determined to\r\ndisregard its own solemn undertaking and refuse to pay an acknowledged\r\ndebt. In that event every day's delay on our part will be a stain upon\r\nour national honor, as well as a denial of justice to our injured\r\ncitizens. Prompt measures, when the refusal of France shall be complete,\r\nwill not only be most honorable and just, but will have the best effect\r\nupon our national character.\r\n\r\nSince France, in violation of the pledges given through her minister\r\nhere, has delayed her final action so long that her decision will\r\nnot probably be known in time to be communicated to this Congress,\r\nI recommend that a law be passed authorizing reprisals upon French\r\nproperty in case provision shall not be made for the payment of the debt\r\nat the approaching session of the French Chambers. Such a measure ought\r\nnot to be considered by France as a menace. Her pride and power are too\r\nwell known to expect anything from her fears and preclude the necessity\r\nof a declaration that nothing partaking of the character of intimidation\r\nis intended by us. She ought to look upon it as the evidence only of an\r\ninflexible determination on the part of the United States to insist\r\non their rights. That Government, by doing only what it has itself\r\nacknowledged to be just, will be able to spare the United States the\r\nnecessity of taking redress into their own hands and save the property\r\nof French citizens from that seizure and sequestration which American\r\ncitizens so long endured without retaliation or redress. If she should\r\ncontinue to refuse that act of acknowledged justice and, in violation\r\nof the law of nations, make reprisals on our part the occasion of\r\nhostilities against the United States, she would but add violence to\r\ninjustice, and could not fail to expose herself to the just censure\r\nof civilized nations and to the retributive judgments of Heaven.\r\n\r\nCollision with France is the more to be regretted on account of the\r\nposition she occupies in Europe in relation to liberal institutions, but\r\nin maintaining our national rights and honor all governments are alike\r\nto us. If by a collision with France in a case where she is clearly\r\nin the wrong the march of liberal principles shall be impeded, the\r\nresponsibility for that result as well as every other will rest on her\r\nown head.\r\n\r\nHaving submitted these considerations, it belongs to Congress to decide\r\nwhether after what has taken place it will still await the further\r\naction of the French Chambers or now adopt such provisional measures\r\nas it may deem necessary and best adapted to protect the rights and\r\nmaintain the honor of the country. Whatever that decision may be, it\r\nwill be faithfully enforced by the Executive as far as he is authorized\r\nso to do.\r\n\r\nAccording to the estimate of the Treasury Department, the revenue\r\naccruing from all sources during the present year will amount to\r\n$20,624,717, which, with the balance remaining in the Treasury\r\non the 1st of January last of $11,702,905, produces an aggregate of\r\n$32,327,623. The total expenditure during the year for all objects,\r\nincluding the public debt, is estimated at $25,591,390, which will leave\r\na balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January, 1835, of $6,736,232.\r\nIn this balance, however, will be included about $1,150,000 of what was\r\nheretofore reported by the Department as not effective.\r\n\r\nOf former appropriations it is estimated that there will remain\r\nunexpended at the close of the year $8,002,925, and that of this sum\r\nthere will not be required more than $5,141,964 to accomplish the\r\nobjects of all the current appropriations. Thus it appears that after\r\nsatisfying all those appropriations and after discharging the last item\r\nof our public debt, which will be done on the 1st of January next, there\r\nwill remain unexpended in the Treasury an effective balance of about\r\n$440,000. That such should be the aspect of our finances is highly\r\nflattering to the industry and enterprise of our population and\r\nauspicious of the wealth and prosperity which await the future\r\ncultivation of their growing resources. It is not deemed prudent,\r\nhowever, to recommend any change for the present in our impost rates,\r\nthe effect of the gradual reduction now in progress in many of them not\r\nbeing sufficiently tested to guide us in determining the precise amount\r\nof revenue which they will produce.\r\n\r\nFree from public debt, at peace with all the world, and with no\r\ncomplicated interests to consult in our intercourse with foreign powers,\r\nthe present may be hailed as the epoch in our history the most favorable\r\nfor the settlement of those principles in our domestic policy which\r\nshall be best calculated to give stability to our Republic and secure\r\nthe blessings of freedom to our citizens.\r\n\r\nAmong these principles, from our past experience, it can not be doubted\r\nthat simplicity in the character of the Federal Government and a rigid\r\neconomy in its administration should be regarded as fundamental and\r\nsacred. All must be sensible that the existence of the public debt, by\r\nrendering taxation necessary for its extinguishment, has increased the\r\ndifficulties which are inseparable from every exercise of the taxing\r\npower, and that it was in this respect a remote agent in producing those\r\ndisturbing questions which grew out of the discussions relating to\r\nthe tariff. If such has been the tendency of a debt incurred in the\r\nacquisition and maintenance of our national rights and liberties, the\r\nobligations of which all portions of the Union cheerfully acknowledged,\r\nit must be obvious that whatever is calculated to increase the burdens\r\nof Government without necessity must be fatal to all our hopes of\r\npreserving its true character. While we are felicitating ourselves,\r\ntherefore, upon the extinguishment of the national debt and the\r\nprosperous state of our finances, let us not be tempted to depart from\r\nthose sound maxims of public policy which enjoin a just adaptation of\r\nthe revenue to the expenditures that are consistent with a rigid economy\r\nand an entire abstinence from all topics of legislation that are not\r\nclearly within the constitutional powers of the Government and suggested\r\nby the wants of the country. Properly regarded under such a policy,\r\nevery diminution of the public burdens arising from taxation gives to\r\nindividual enterprise increased power and furnishes to all the members\r\nof our happy Confederacy new motives for patriotic affection and\r\nsupport. But above all, its most important effect will be found in its\r\ninfluence upon the character of the Government by confining its action\r\nto those objects which will be sure to secure to it the attachment and\r\nsupport of our fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nCircumstances make it my duty to call the attention of Congress to\r\nthe Bank of the United States. Created for the convenience of the\r\nGovernment, that institution has become the scourge of the people. Its\r\ninterference to postpone the payment of a portion of the national debt\r\nthat it might retain the public money appropriated for that purpose to\r\nstrengthen it in a political contest, the extraordinary extension and\r\ncontraction of its accommodations to the community, its corrupt and\r\npartisan loans, its exclusion of the public directors from a knowledge\r\nof its most important proceedings, the unlimited authority conferred on\r\nthe president to expend its funds in hiring writers and procuring the\r\nexecution of printing, and the use made of that authority, the retention\r\nof the pension money and books after the selection of new agents, the\r\ngroundless claim to heavy damages in consequence of the protest of the\r\nbill drawn on the French Government, have through various channels been\r\nlaid before Congress. Immediately after the close of the last session\r\nthe bank, through its president, announced its ability and readiness to\r\nabandon the system of unparalleled curtailment and the interruption of\r\ndomestic exchanges which it had practiced upon from the 1st of August,\r\n1833, to the 30th of June, 1834, and to extend its accommodations to\r\nthe community. The grounds assumed in this annunciation amounted to an\r\nacknowledgment that the curtailment, in the extent to which it had been\r\ncarried, was not necessary to the safety of the bank, and had been\r\npersisted in merely to induce Congress to grant the prayer of the bank\r\nin its memorial relative to the removal of the deposits and to give it\r\na new charter. They were substantially a confession that all the real\r\ndistresses which individuals and the country had endured for the\r\npreceding six or eight months had been needlessly produced by it,\r\nwith the view of affecting through the sufferings of the people the\r\nlegislative action of Congress. It is a subject of congratulation\r\nthat Congress and the country had the virtue and firmness to bear the\r\ninfliction, that the energies of our people soon found relief from this\r\nwanton tyranny in vast importations of the precious metals from almost\r\nevery part of the world, and that at the close of this tremendous effort\r\nto control our Government the bank found itself powerless and no longer\r\nable to loan out its surplus means. The community had learned to manage\r\nits affairs without its assistance, and trade had already found new\r\nauxiliaries, so that on the 1st of October last the extraordinary\r\nspectacle was presented of a national bank more than one-half of whose\r\ncapital was either lying unproductive in its vaults or in the hands of\r\nforeign bankers.\r\n\r\nTo the needless distresses brought on the country during the last\r\nsession of Congress has since been added the open seizure of the\r\ndividends on the public stock to the amount of $170,041, under pretense\r\nof paying damages, cost, and interest upon the protested French bill.\r\nThis sum constituted a portion of the estimated revenues for the year\r\n1834, upon which the appropriations made by Congress were based. It\r\nwould as soon have been expected that our collectors would seize on the\r\ncustoms or the receivers of our land offices on the moneys arising from\r\nthe sale of public lands under pretenses of claims against the United\r\nStates as that the bank would have retained the dividends. Indeed, if\r\nthe principle be established that anyone who chooses to set up a claim\r\nagainst the United States may without authority of law seize on the\r\npublic property or money wherever he can find it to pay such claim,\r\nthere will remain no assurance that our revenue will reach the Treasury\r\nor that it will be applied after the appropriation to the purposes\r\ndesignated in the law. The paymasters of our Army and the pursers of our\r\nNavy may under like pretenses apply to their own use moneys appropriated\r\nto set in motion the public force, and in time of war leave the country\r\nwithout defense. This measure resorted to by the bank is disorganizing\r\nand revolutionary, and if generally resorted to by private citizens in\r\nlike cases would fill the land with anarchy and violence.\r\n\r\nIt is a constitutional provision \"that no money shall be drawn from\r\nthe Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law.\" The\r\npalpable object of this provision is to prevent the expenditure of the\r\npublic money for any purpose whatsoever which shall not have been first\r\napproved by the representatives of the people and the States in Congress\r\nassembled. It vests the power of declaring for what purposes the public\r\nmoney shall be expended in the legislative department of the Government,\r\nto the exclusion of the executive and judicial, and it is not within\r\nthe constitutional authority of either of those departments to pay it\r\naway without law or to sanction its payment. According to this plain\r\nconstitutional provision, the claim of the bank can never be paid\r\nwithout an appropriation by act of Congress. But the bank has never\r\nasked for an appropriation. It attempts to defeat the provision of the\r\nConstitution and obtain payment without an act of Congress. Instead of\r\nawaiting an appropriation passed by both Houses and approved by the\r\nPresident, it makes an appropriation for itself and invites an appeal\r\nto the judiciary to sanction it. That the money had not technically\r\nbeen paid into the Treasury does not affect the principle intended to\r\nbe established by the Constitution. The Executive and the judiciary\r\nhave as little right to appropriate and expend the public money without\r\nauthority of law before it is placed to the credit of the Treasury as to\r\ntake it from the Treasury. In the annual report of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and in his correspondence with the president of the bank, and\r\nthe opinions of the Attorney-General accompanying it, you will find a\r\nfurther examination of the claims of the bank and the course it has\r\npursued.\r\n\r\nIt seems due to the safety of the public funds remaining in that bank\r\nand to the honor of the American people that measures be taken to\r\nseparate the Government entirely from an institution so mischievous to\r\nthe public prosperity and so regardless of the Constitution and laws. By\r\ntransferring the public deposits, by appointing other pension agents as\r\nfar as it had the power, by ordering the discontinuance of the receipt\r\nof bank checks in the payment of the public dues after the 1st day of\r\nJanuary, the Executive has exerted all its lawful authority to sever the\r\nconnection between the Government and this faithless corporation.\r\n\r\nThe high-handed career of this institution imposes upon the\r\nconstitutional functionaries of this Government duties of the gravest\r\nand most imperative character--duties which they can not avoid and from\r\nwhich I trust there will be no inclination on the part of any of them\r\nto shrink. My own sense of them is most clear, as is also my readiness\r\nto discharge those which may rightfully fall on me. To continue any\r\nbusiness relations with the Bank of the United States that may be\r\navoided without a violation of the national faith after that institution\r\nhas set at open defiance the conceded right of the Government to examine\r\nits affairs, after it has done all in its power to deride the public\r\nauthority in other respects and to bring it into disrepute at home and\r\nabroad, after it has attempted to defeat the clearly expressed will of\r\nthe people by turning against them the immense power intrusted to its\r\nhands and by involving a country otherwise peaceful, flourishing, and\r\nhappy, in dissension, embarrassment, and distress, would make the nation\r\nitself a party to the degradation so sedulously prepared for its public\r\nagents and do much to destroy the confidence of mankind in popular\r\ngovernments and to bring into contempt their authority and efficiency.\r\nIn guarding against an evil of such magnitude considerations of\r\ntemporary convenience should be thrown out of the question, and we\r\nshould be influenced by such motives only as look to the honor and\r\npreservation of the republican system. Deeply and solemnly impressed\r\nwith the justice of these views, I feel it to be my duty to recommend to\r\nyou that a law be passed authorizing the sale of the public stock: that\r\nthe provision of the charter requiring the receipt of notes of the bank\r\nin payment of public dues shall, in accordance with the power reserved\r\nto Congress in the fourteenth section of the charter, be suspended until\r\nthe bank pays to the Treasury the dividends withheld, and that all laws\r\nconnecting the Government or its officers with the bank, directly or\r\nindirectly, be repealed, and that the institution be left hereafter\r\nto its own resources and means.\r\n\r\nEvents have satisfied my mind, and I think the minds of the American\r\npeople, that the mischiefs and dangers which flow from a national bank\r\nfar overbalance all its advantages. The bold effort the present bank has\r\nmade to control the Government, the distresses it has wantonly produced,\r\nthe violence of which it has been the occasion in one of our cities\r\nfamed for its observance of law and order, are but premonitions of the\r\nfate which awaits the American people should they be deluded into a\r\nperpetuation of this institution or the establishment of another like\r\nit. It is fervently hoped that thus admonished those who have heretofore\r\nfavored the establishment of a substitute for the present bank will\r\nbe induced to abandon it, as it is evidently better to incur any\r\ninconvenience that may be reasonably expected than to concentrate the\r\nwhole moneyed power of the Republic in any form whatsoever or under\r\nany restrictions.\r\n\r\nHappily it is already illustrated that the agency of such an institution\r\nis not necessary to the fiscal operations of the Government. The State\r\nbanks are found fully adequate to the performance of all services which\r\nwere required of the Bank of the United States, quite as promptly and\r\nwith the same cheapness. They have maintained themselves and discharged\r\nall these duties while the Bank of the United States was still powerful\r\nand in the field as an open enemy, and it is not possible to conceive\r\nthat they will find greater difficulties in their operations when that\r\nenemy shall cease to exist.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is earnestly invited to the regulation of the\r\ndeposits in the State banks by law. Although the power now exercised by\r\nthe executive department in this behalf is only such as was uniformly\r\nexerted through every Administration from the origin of the Government\r\nup to the establishment of the present bank, yet it is one which\r\nis susceptible of regulation by law, and therefore ought so to be\r\nregulated. The power of Congress to direct in what places the Treasurer\r\nshall keep the moneys in the Treasury and to impose restrictions upon\r\nthe Executive authority in relation to their custody and removal is\r\nunlimited, and its exercise will rather be courted than discouraged by\r\nthose public officers and agents on whom rests the responsibility for\r\ntheir safety. It is desirable that as little power as possible should\r\nbe left to the President or the Secretary of the Treasury over those\r\ninstitutions, which, being thus freed from Executive influence, and\r\nwithout a common head to direct their operations, would have neither the\r\ntemptation nor the ability to interfere in the political conflicts of\r\nthe country. Not deriving their charters from the national authorities,\r\nthey would never have those inducements to meddle in general elections\r\nwhich have led the Bank of the United States to agitate and convulse the\r\ncountry for upward of two years.\r\n\r\nThe progress of our gold coinage is creditable to the officers of\r\nthe Mint, and promises in a short period to furnish the country with a\r\nsound and portable currency, which will much diminish the inconvenience\r\nto travelers of the want of a general paper currency should the State\r\nbanks be incapable of furnishing it. Those institutions have already\r\nshown themselves competent to purchase and furnish domestic exchange\r\nfor the convenience of trade at reasonable rates, and not a doubt is\r\nentertained that in a short period all the wants of the country in bank\r\naccommodations and exchange will be supplied as promptly and as cheaply\r\nas they have heretofore been by the Bank of the United States. If the\r\nseveral States shall be induced gradually to reform their banking\r\nsystems and prohibit the issue of all small notes, we shall in a few\r\nyears have a currency as sound and as little liable to fluctuations\r\nas any other commercial country.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War, together with the accompanying\r\ndocuments from the several bureaus of that Department, will exhibit\r\nthe situation of the various objects committed to its administration.\r\n\r\nNo event has occurred since your last session rendering necessary any\r\nmovements of the Army, with the exception of the expedition of the\r\nregiment of dragoons into the territory of the wandering and predatory\r\ntribes inhabiting the western frontier and living adjacent to the\r\nMexican boundary. These tribes have been heretofore known to us\r\nprincipally by their attacks upon our own citizens and upon other\r\nIndians entitled to the protection of the United States. It became\r\nnecessary for the peace of the frontiers to check these habitual\r\ninroads, and I am happy to inform you that the object has been effected\r\nwithout the commission of any act of hostility. Colonel Dodge and the\r\ntroops under his command have acted with equal firmness and humanity,\r\nand an arrangement has been made with those Indians which it is hoped\r\nwill assure their permanent pacific relations with the United States and\r\nthe other tribes of Indians upon that border. It is to be regretted that\r\nthe prevalence of sickness in that quarter has deprived the country of a\r\nnumber of valuable lives, and particularly that General Leavenworth, an\r\nofficer well known, and esteemed for his gallant services in the late\r\nwar and for his subsequent good conduct, has fallen a victim to his zeal\r\nand exertions in the discharge of his duty.\r\n\r\nThe Army is in a high state of discipline. Its moral condition, so far\r\nas that is known here, is good, and the various branches of the public\r\nservice are carefully attended to. It is amply sufficient under its\r\npresent organization for providing the necessary garrisons for the\r\nseaboard and for the defense of the internal frontier, and also for\r\npreserving the elements of military knowledge and for keeping pace\r\nwith those improvements which modern experience is continually making.\r\nAnd these objects appear to me to embrace all the legitimate purposes\r\nfor which a permanent military force should be maintained in our\r\ncountry. The lessons of history teach us its danger and the tendency\r\nwhich exists to an increase. This can be best met and averted by a just\r\ncaution on the part of the public itself, and of those who represent\r\nthem in Congress.\r\n\r\nFrom the duties which devolve on the Engineer Department and upon\r\nthe topographical engineers, a different organization seems to be\r\ndemanded by the public interest, and I recommend the subject to\r\nyour consideration.\r\n\r\nNo important change has during this season taken place in the condition\r\nof the Indians. Arrangements are in progress for the removal of the\r\nCreeks, and will soon be for the removal of the Seminoles. I regret that\r\nthe Cherokees east of the Mississippi have not yet determined as a\r\ncommunity to remove. How long the personal causes which have heretofore\r\nretarded that ultimately inevitable measure will continue to operate\r\nI am unable to conjecture. It is certain, however, that delay will bring\r\nwith it accumulated evils which will render their condition more and\r\nmore unpleasant. The experience of every year adds to the conviction\r\nthat emigration, and that alone, can preserve from destruction the\r\nremnant of the tribes yet living amongst us. The facility with which the\r\nnecessaries of life are procured and the treaty stipulations providing\r\naid for the emigrant Indians in their agricultural pursuits and in the\r\nimportant concern of education, and their removal from those causes\r\nwhich have heretofore depressed all and destroyed many of the tribes,\r\ncan not fail to stimulate their exertions and to reward their industry.\r\n\r\nThe two laws passed at the last session of Congress on the subject of\r\nIndian affairs have been carried into effect, and detailed instructions\r\nfor their administration have been given. It will be seen by the\r\nestimates for the present session that a great reduction will take place\r\nin the expenditures of the Department in consequence of these laws, and\r\nthere is reason to believe that their operation will be salutary and\r\nthat the colonization of the Indians on the western frontier, together\r\nwith a judicious system of administration, will still further reduce\r\nthe expenses of this branch of the public service and at the same time\r\npromote its usefulness and efficiency.\r\n\r\nCircumstances have been recently developed showing the existence of\r\nextensive frauds under the various laws granting pensions and gratuities\r\nfor Revolutionary services. It is impossible to estimate the amount\r\nwhich may have been thus fraudulently obtained from the National\r\nTreasury. I am satisfied, however, it has been such as to justify a\r\nreexamination of the system and the adoption of the necessary checks in\r\nits administration. All will agree that the services and sufferings of\r\nthe remnant of our Revolutionary band should be fully compensated; but\r\nwhile this is done, every proper precaution should be taken to prevent\r\nthe admission of fabricated and fraudulent claims. In the present mode\r\nof proceeding the attestations and certificates of the judicial officers\r\nof the various States form a considerable portion of the checks which\r\nare interposed against the commission of frauds. These, however, have\r\nbeen and may be fabricated, and in such a way as to elude detection at\r\nthe examining offices. And independently of this practical difficulty,\r\nit is ascertained that these documents are often loosely granted;\r\nsometimes even blank certificates have been issued; sometimes prepared\r\npapers have been signed without inquiry, and in one instance, at least,\r\nthe seal of the court has been within reach of a person most interested\r\nin its improper application. It is obvious that under such circumstances\r\nno severity of administration can check the abuse of the law. And\r\ninformation has from time to time been communicated to the Pension\r\nOffice questioning or denying the right of persons placed upon the\r\npension list to the bounty of the country. Such cautions are always\r\nattended to and examined, but a far more general investigation is called\r\nfor, and I therefore recommend, in conformity with the suggestion of the\r\nSecretary of War, that an actual inspection should be made in each State\r\ninto the circumstances and claims of every person now drawing a pension.\r\nThe honest veteran has nothing to fear from such a scrutiny, while the\r\nfraudulent claimant will be detected and the public Treasury relieved to\r\nan amount, I have reason to believe, far greater than has heretofore\r\nbeen suspected. The details of such a plan could be so regulated as to\r\ninterpose the necessary checks without any burdensome operation upon the\r\npensioners. The object should be twofold:\r\n\r\n1. To look into the original justice of the claims, so far as this can\r\nbe done under a proper system of regulations, by an examination of the\r\nclaimants themselves and by inquiring in the vicinity of their residence\r\ninto their history and into the opinion entertained of their\r\nRevolutionary services.\r\n\r\n2. To ascertain in all cases whether the original claimant is living,\r\nand this by actual personal inspection.\r\n\r\nThis measure will, if adopted, be productive, I think, of the desired\r\nresults, and I therefore recommend it to your consideration, with the\r\nfurther suggestion that all payments should be suspended till the\r\nnecessary reports are received.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by a tabular statement annexed to the documents\r\ntransmitted to Congress that the appropriations for objects connected\r\nwith the War Department, made at the last session, for the service of\r\nthe year 1834, excluding the permanent appropriation for the payment of\r\nmilitary gratuities under the act of June 7, 1832, the appropriation of\r\n$200,000 for arming and equipping the militia, and the appropriation of\r\n$10,000 for the civilization of the Indians, which are not annually\r\nrenewed, amounted to the sum of $9,003,261, and that the estimates of\r\nappropriations necessary for the same branches of service for the year\r\n1835 amount to the sum of $5,778,964, making a difference in the\r\nappropriations of the current year over the estimates of the\r\nappropriations for the next of $3,224,297.\r\n\r\nThe principal causes which have operated at this time to produce this\r\ngreat difference are shown in the reports and documents and in the\r\ndetailed estimates. Some of these causes are accidental and temporary;\r\nwhile others are permanent, and, aided by a just course of\r\nadministration, may continue to operate beneficially upon the public\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\nA just economy, expending where the public service requires and\r\nwithholding where it does not, is among the indispensable duties of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy\r\nand to the documents with it for a full view of the operations of that\r\nimportant branch of our service during the present year. It will be\r\nseen that the wisdom and liberality with which Congress has provided\r\nfor the gradual increase of our navy material have been seconded by a\r\ncorresponding zeal and fidelity on the part of those to whom has been\r\nconfided the execution of the laws on the subject, and that but a short\r\nperiod would be now required to put in commission a force large enough\r\nfor any exigency into which the country may be thrown.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect upon our position in relation to other nations, it\r\nmust be apparent that in the event of conflicts with them we must look\r\nchiefly to our Navy for the protection of our national rights. The wide\r\nseas which separate us from other Governments must of necessity be the\r\ntheater on which an enemy will aim to assail us, and unless we are\r\nprepared to meet him on this element we can not be said to possess the\r\npower requisite to repel or prevent aggressions. We can not, therefore,\r\nwatch with too much attention this arm of our defense, or cherish with\r\ntoo much care the means by which it can possess the necessary efficiency\r\nand extension. To this end our policy has been heretofore wisely\r\ndirected to the constant employment of a force sufficient to guard our\r\ncommerce, and to the rapid accumulation of the materials which are\r\nnecessary to repair our vessels and construct with ease such new ones\r\nas may be required in a state of war.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this policy, I recommend to your consideration the\r\nerection of the additional dry dock described by the Secretary of the\r\nNavy, and also the construction of the steam batteries to which he has\r\nreferred, for the purpose of testing their efficacy as auxiliaries to\r\nthe system of defense now in use.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General herewith submitted exhibits the\r\ncondition and prospects of that Department. From that document it\r\nappears that there was a deficit in the funds of the Department at\r\nthe commencement of the present year beyond its available means of\r\n$315,599.98, which on the 1st July last had been reduced to $268,092.74.\r\nIt appears also that the revenues for the coming year will exceed the\r\nexpenditures about $270,000, which, with the excess of revenue which\r\nwill result from the operations of the current half year, may be\r\nexpected, independently of any increase in the gross amount of postages,\r\nto supply the entire deficit before the end of 1835. But as this\r\ncalculation is based on the gross amount of postages which had accrued\r\nwithin the period embraced by the times of striking the balances, it is\r\nobvious that without a progressive increase in the amount of postages\r\nthe existing retrenchments must be persevered in through the year 1836\r\nthat the Department may accumulate a surplus fund sufficient to place\r\nit in a condition of perfect ease.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the revenues of the Post-Office Department,\r\nthough they have increased, and their amount is above that of any former\r\nyear, have yet fallen short of the estimates more than $100,000. This is\r\nattributed in a great degree to the increase of free letters growing out\r\nof the extension and abuse of the franking privilege. There has been a\r\ngradual increase in the number of executive offices to which it has been\r\ngranted, and by an act passed in March, 1833, it was extended to members\r\nof Congress throughout the whole year. It is believed that a revision of\r\nthe laws relative to the franking privilege, with some enactments to\r\nenforce more rigidly the restrictions under which it is granted, would\r\noperate beneficially to the country, by enabling the Department at an\r\nearlier period to restore the mail facilities that have been withdrawn,\r\nand to extend them more widely, as the growing settlements of the\r\ncountry may require.\r\n\r\nTo a measure so important to the Government and so just to our\r\nconstituents, who ask no exclusive privileges for themselves and are not\r\nwilling to concede them to others, I earnestly recommend the serious\r\nattention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the Post-Office Department and the magnitude to which\r\nit has grown, both in its revenues and in its operations, seem to demand\r\nits reorganization by law. The whole of its receipts and disbursements\r\nhave hitherto been left entirely to Executive control and individual\r\ndiscretion. The principle is as sound in relation to this as to any\r\nother Department of the Government, that as little discretion should be\r\nconfided to the executive officer who controls it as is compatible with\r\nits efficiency. It is therefore earnestly recommended that it be\r\norganized with an auditor and treasurer of its own, appointed by the\r\nPresident and Senate, who shall be branches of the Treasury Department.\r\n\r\nYour attention is again respectfully invited to the defect which exists\r\nin the judicial system of the United States. Nothing can be more\r\ndesirable than the uniform operation of the Federal judiciary throughout\r\nthe several States, all of which, standing on the same footing as\r\nmembers of the Union, have equal rights to the advantages and benefits\r\nresulting from its laws. This object is not attained by the judicial\r\nacts now in force, because they leave one-fourth of the States without\r\ncircuit courts.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly the duty of Congress to place all the States on the\r\nsame footing in this respect, either by the creation of an additional\r\nnumber of associate judges or by an enlargement of the circuits assigned\r\nto those already appointed so as to include the new States. Whatever may\r\nbe the difficulty in a proper organization of the judicial system so as\r\nto secure its efficiency and uniformity in all parts of the Union and at\r\nthe same time to avoid such an increase of judges as would encumber the\r\nsupreme appellate tribunal, it should not be allowed to weigh against\r\nthe great injustice which the present operation of the system produces.\r\n\r\nI trust that I may be also pardoned for renewing the recommendation\r\nI have so often submitted to your attention in regard to the mode of\r\nelecting the President and Vice-President of the United States. All the\r\nreflection I have been able to bestow upon the subject increases my\r\nconviction that the best interests of the country will be promoted by\r\nthe adoption of some plan which will secure in all contingencies that\r\nimportant right of sovereignty to the direct control of the people.\r\nCould this be attained, and the terms of those officers be limited to a\r\nsingle period of either four or six years, I think our liberties would\r\npossess an additional safeguard.\r\n\r\nAt your last session I called the attention of Congress to the\r\ndestruction of the public building occupied by the Treasury Department.\r\nAs the public interest requires that another building should be erected\r\nwith as little delay as possible, it is hoped that the means will be\r\nseasonably provided and that they will be ample enough to authorize such\r\nan enlargement and improvement in the plan of the building as will more\r\neffectually accommodate the public officers and secure the public\r\ndocuments deposited in it from the casualties of fire.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to satisfy myself that the bill entitled \"An act to\r\nimprove the navigation of the Wabash River,\" which was sent to me at the\r\nclose of your last session, ought to pass, and I have therefore withheld\r\nfrom it my approval and now return it to the Senate, the body in which\r\nit originated.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question connected with the administration of public\r\naffairs more important or more difficult to be satisfactorily dealt with\r\nthan that which relates to the rightful authority and proper action of\r\nthe Federal Government upon the subject of internal improvements. To\r\ninherent embarrassments have been added others resulting from the course\r\nof our legislation concerning it.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore communicated freely with Congress upon this subject,\r\nand in adverting to it again I can not refrain from expressing my\r\nincreased conviction of its extreme importance as well in regard to\r\nits bearing upon the maintenance of the Constitution and the prudent\r\nmanagement of the public revenue as on account of its disturbing effect\r\nupon the harmony of the Union.\r\n\r\nWe are in no danger from violations of the Constitution by which\r\nencroachments are made upon the personal rights of the citizen. The\r\nsentence of condemnation long since pronounced by the American people\r\nupon acts of that character will, I doubt not, continue to prove as\r\nsalutary in its effects as it is irreversible in its nature. But against\r\nthe dangers of unconstitutional acts which, instead of menacing the\r\nvengeance of offended authority, proffer local advantages and bring\r\nin their train the patronage of the Government, we are, I fear, not so\r\nsafe. To suppose that because our Government has been instituted for the\r\nbenefit of the people it must therefore have the power to do whatever\r\nmay seem to conduce to the public good is an error into which even\r\nhonest minds are too apt to fall. In yielding themselves to this fallacy\r\nthey overlook the great considerations in which the Federal Constitution\r\nwas founded. They forget that in consequence of the conceded diversities\r\nin the interest and condition of the different States it was foreseen at\r\nthe period of its adoption that although a particular measure of the\r\nGovernment might be beneficial and proper in one State it might be the\r\nreverse in another; that it was for this reason the States would not\r\nconsent to make a grant to the Federal Government of the general and\r\nusual powers of government, but of such only as were specifically\r\nenumerated, and the probable effects of which they could, as they\r\nthought, safely anticipate; and they forget also the paramount\r\nobligation upon all to abide by the compact then so solemnly and, as\r\nit was hoped, so firmly established. In addition to the dangers to the\r\nConstitution springing from the sources I have stated, there has been\r\none which was perhaps greater than all. I allude to the materials which\r\nthis subject has afforded for sinister appeals to selfish feelings, and\r\nthe opinion heretofore so extensively entertained of its adaptation to\r\nthe purposes of personal ambition. With such stimulants it is not\r\nsurprising that the acts and pretensions of the Federal Government in\r\nthis behalf should sometimes have been carried to an alarming extent.\r\nThe questions which have arisen upon this subject have related--\r\n\r\nFirst. To the power of making internal improvements within the limits of\r\na State, with the right of territorial jurisdiction, sufficient at least\r\nfor their preservation and use.\r\n\r\nSecond. To the right of appropriating money in aid of such works when\r\ncarried on by a State or by a company in virtue of State authority,\r\nsurrendering the claim of jurisdiction; and\r\n\r\nThird. To the propriety of appropriation for improvements of a\r\nparticular class, viz, for light-houses, beacons, buoys, public piers,\r\nand for the removal of sand bars, sawyers, and other temporary and\r\npartial impediments in our navigable rivers and harbors.\r\n\r\nThe claims of power for the General Government upon each of these\r\npoints certainly present matter of the deepest interest. The first is,\r\nhowever, of much the greatest importance, inasmuch as, in addition to\r\nthe dangers of unequal and improvident expenditures of public moneys\r\ncommon to all, there is superadded to that the conflicting jurisdictions\r\nof the respective governments. Federal jurisdiction, at least to the\r\nextent I have stated, has been justly regarded by its advocates as\r\nnecessarily appurtenant to the power in question, if that exists by\r\nthe Constitution. That the most injurious conflicts would unavoidably\r\narise between the respective jurisdictions of the State and Federal\r\nGovernments in the absence of a constitutional provision marking out\r\ntheir respective boundaries can not be doubted. The local advantages to\r\nbe obtained would induce the States to overlook in the beginning the\r\ndangers and difficulties to which they might ultimately be exposed. The\r\npowers exercised by the Federal Government would soon be regarded with\r\njealousy by the State authorities, and originating as they must from\r\nimplication or assumption, it would be impossible to affix to them\r\ncertain and safe limits. Opportunities and temptations to the assumption\r\nof power incompatible with State sovereignty would be increased and\r\nthose barriers which resist the tendency of our system toward\r\nconsolidation greatly weakened. The officers and agents of the General\r\nGovernment might not always have the discretion to abstain from\r\nintermeddling with State concerns, and if they did they would not always\r\nescape the suspicion of having done so. Collisions and consequent\r\nirritations would spring up; that harmony which should ever exist\r\nbetween the General Government and each member of the Confederacy would\r\nbe frequently interrupted; a spirit of contention would be engendered\r\nand the dangers of disunion greatly multiplied.\r\n\r\nYet we all know that notwithstanding these grave objections this\r\ndangerous doctrine was at one time apparently proceeding to its final\r\nestablishment with fearful rapidity. The desire to embark the Federal\r\nGovernment in works of internal improvement prevailed in the highest\r\ndegree during the first session of the first Congress that I had the\r\nhonor to meet in my present situation. When the bill authorizing a\r\nsubscription on the part of the United States for stock in the Maysville\r\nand Lexington Turnpike Company passed the two Houses, there had been\r\nreported by the Committees of Internal Improvements bills containing\r\nappropriations for such objects, inclusive of those for the Cumberland\r\nroad and for harbors and light-houses, to the amount of $106,000,000. In\r\nthis amount was included authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to\r\nsubscribe for the stock of different companies to a great extent, and\r\nthe residue was principally for the direct construction of roads by this\r\nGovernment. In addition to these projects, which had been presented to\r\nthe two Houses under the sanction and recommendation of their respective\r\nCommittees on Internal Improvements, there were then still pending\r\nbefore the committees, and in memorials to Congress presented but not\r\nreferred, different projects for works of a similar character, the\r\nexpense of which can not be estimated with certainty, but must have\r\nexceeded $100,000,000.\r\n\r\nRegarding the bill authorizing a subscription to the stock of the\r\nMaysville and Lexington Turnpike Company as the entering wedge of a\r\nsystem which, however weak at first, might soon become strong enough to\r\nrive the bands of the Union asunder, and believing that if its passage\r\nwas acquiesced in by the Executive and the people there would no longer\r\nbe any limitation upon the authority of the General Government in\r\nrespect to the appropriation of money for such objects, I deemed it an\r\nimperative duty to withhold from it the Executive approval. Although\r\nfrom the obviously local character of that work I might well have\r\ncontented myself with a refusal to approve the bill upon that ground,\r\nyet sensible of the vital importance of the subject, and anxious that\r\nmy views and opinions in regard to the whole matter should be fully\r\nunderstood by Congress and by my constituents, I felt it my duty to go\r\nfurther. I therefore embraced that early occasion to apprise Congress\r\nthat in my opinion the Constitution did not confer upon it the power\r\nto authorize the construction of ordinary roads and canals within the\r\nlimits of a State and to say, respectfully, that no bill admitting such\r\na power could receive my official sanction. I did so in the confident\r\nexpectation that the speedy settlement of the public mind upon the whole\r\nsubject would be greatly facilitated by the difference between the two\r\nHouses and myself, and that the harmonious action of the several\r\ndepartments of the Federal Government in regard to it would be\r\nultimately secured.\r\n\r\nSo far, at least, as it regards this branch of the subject, my best\r\nhopes have been realized. Nearly four years have elapsed, and several\r\nsessions of Congress have intervened, and no attempt within my\r\nrecollection has been made to induce Congress to exercise this power.\r\nThe applications for the construction of roads and canals which were\r\nformerly multiplied upon your files are no longer presented, and we have\r\ngood reason to infer that the current of public sentiment has become\r\nso decided against the pretension as effectually to discourage its\r\nreassertion. So thinking, I derive the greatest satisfaction from the\r\nconviction that thus much at least has been secured upon this important\r\nand embarrassing subject.\r\n\r\nFrom attempts to appropriate the national funds to objects which are\r\nconfessedly of a local character we can not, I trust, have anything\r\nfurther to apprehend. My views in regard to the expediency of making\r\nappropriations for works which are claimed to be of a national character\r\nand prosecuted under State authority--assuming that Congress have the\r\nright to do so--were stated in my annual message to Congress in 1830,\r\nand also in that containing my objections to the Maysville road bill.\r\n\r\nSo thoroughly convinced am I that no such appropriations ought to\r\nbe made by Congress until a suitable constitutional provision is\r\nmade upon the subject, and so essential do I regard the point to the\r\nhighest interests of our country, that I could not consider myself as\r\ndischarging my duty to my constituents in giving the Executive sanction\r\nto any bill containing such an appropriation. If the people of the\r\nUnited States desire that the public Treasury shall be resorted to for\r\nthe means to prosecute such works, they will concur in an amendment of\r\nthe Constitution prescribing a rule by which the national character\r\nof the works is to be tested, and by which the greatest practicable\r\nequality of benefits may be secured to each member of the Confederacy.\r\nThe effects of such a regulation would be most salutary in preventing\r\nunprofitable expenditures, in securing our legislation from the\r\npernicious consequences of a scramble for the favors of Government,\r\nand in repressing the spirit of discontent which must inevitably arise\r\nfrom an unequal distribution of treasures which belong alike to all.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of appropriations for what may be called, without\r\nimpropriety, internal improvements, which have always been regarded as\r\nstanding upon different grounds from those to which I have referred. I\r\nallude to such as have for their object the improvement of our harbors,\r\nthe removal of partial and temporary obstructions in our navigable\r\nrivers, for the facility and security of our foreign commerce. The\r\ngrounds upon which I distinguished appropriations of this character from\r\nothers have already been stated to Congress. I will now only add that at\r\nthe first session of Congress under the new Constitution it was provided\r\nby law that all expenses which should accrue from and after the 15th day\r\nof August, 1789, in the necessary support and maintenance and repairs of\r\nall light-houses, beacons, buoys, and public piers erected, placed, or\r\nsunk before the passage of the act within any bay, inlet, harbor, or\r\nport of the United States, for rendering the navigation thereof easy and\r\nsafe, should be defrayed out of the Treasury of the United States, and,\r\nfurther, that it should be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nto provide by contracts, with the approbation of the President, for\r\nrebuilding when necessary and keeping in good repair the light-houses,\r\nbeacons, buoys, and public piers in the several States, and for\r\nfurnishing them with supplies. Appropriations for similar objects have\r\nbeen continued from that time to the present without interruption or\r\ndispute. As a natural consequence of the increase and extension of our\r\nforeign commerce, ports of entry and delivery have been multiplied and\r\nestablished, not only upon our seaboard, but in the interior of the\r\ncountry upon our lakes and navigable rivers. The convenience and\r\nsafety of this commerce have led to the gradual extension of these\r\nexpenditures; to the erection of light-houses, the placing, planting,\r\nand sinking of buoys, beacons, and piers, and to the removal of partial\r\nand temporary obstructions in our navigable rivers and in the harbors\r\nupon our Great Lakes as well as on the seaboard. Although I have\r\nexpressed to Congress my apprehension that these expenditures have\r\nsometimes been extravagant and disproportionate to the advantages to be\r\nderived from them, I have not felt it to be my duty to refuse my assent\r\nto bills containing them, and have contented myself to follow in this\r\nrespect in the footsteps of all my predecessors. Sensible, however, from\r\nexperience and observation of the great abuses to which the unrestricted\r\nexercise of this authority by Congress was exposed, I have prescribed a\r\nlimitation for the government of my own conduct by which expenditures of\r\nthis character are confined to places below the ports of entry or\r\ndelivery established by law. I am very sensible that this restriction is\r\nnot as satisfactory as could be desired, and that much embarrassment may\r\nbe caused to the executive department in its execution by appropriations\r\nfor remote and not well-understood objects. But as neither my own\r\nreflections nor the lights which I may properly derive from other\r\nsources have supplied me with a better, I shall continue to apply my\r\nbest exertions to a faithful application of the rule upon which it is\r\nfounded. I sincerely regret that I could not give my assent to the bill\r\nentitled \"An act to improve the navigation of the Wabash River;\" but\r\nI could not have done so without receding from the ground which I have,\r\nupon the fullest consideration, taken upon this subject, and of which\r\nCongress has been heretofore apprised, and without throwing the subject\r\nagain open to abuses which no good citizen entertaining my opinions\r\ncould desire.\r\n\r\nI rely upon the intelligence and candor of my fellow-citizens, in whose\r\nliberal indulgence I have already so largely participated, for a correct\r\nappreciation of my motives in interposing as I have done on this and\r\nother occasions checks to a course of legislation which, without in the\r\nslightest degree calling in question the motives of others, I consider\r\nas sanctioning improper and unconstitutional expenditures of public\r\ntreasure.\r\n\r\nI am not hostile to internal improvements, and wish to see them extended\r\nto every part of the country. But I am fully persuaded, if they are not\r\ncommenced in a proper manner, confined to proper objects, and conducted\r\nunder an authority generally conceded to be rightful, that a successful\r\nprosecution of them can not be reasonably expected. The attempt will\r\nmeet with resistance where it might otherwise receive support, and\r\ninstead of strengthening the bonds of our Confederacy it will only\r\nmultiply and aggravate the causes of disunion.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 4, 1834_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a communication addressed to me by M.

We most fervently wish\r\nthat the homage of our everlasting devotion to a nation whose tears\r\nhave deigned to mingle with ours should be offered to both Houses\r\nof Congress. Transmitted by you, sir, that homage shall be rendered\r\nacceptable, and we earnestly pray you, sir, to present it in our name.\r\nOur gratitude shall be forever adequate to the obligation.\r\n\r\nThe resolution which so powerfully honors my father's memory shall be\r\ndeposited as a most sacred family property in that room of mourning\r\nwhere once his son and grandsons used to receive with avidity from him\r\nlessons of patriotism and active love of liberty. There the daily\r\ncontemplation of it will more and more impress their minds with that\r\nencouraging conviction that the affection and esteem of a free nation\r\nis the most desirable reward that can be obtained on earth.\r\n\r\nWith the utmost respect, sir, I have the honor to be, your devoted and\r\nobedient servant,\r\n\r\nGEORGE W.

and I have to acquaint the House that the negotiation for\r\nthe settlement of the northeastern boundary being now in progress, it\r\nwould, in my opinion, be incompatible with the public interest to lay\r\nbefore the House any communications which have been had between the two\r\nGovernments since the period alluded to in the resolution.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 13, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of the 8th instant,\r\nrequesting \"copies of every circular or letter of instruction emanating\r\nfrom the Treasury or War Departments since the 30th day of June last,\r\nand addressed to either the receiving or the disbursing officers\r\nstationed in States wherein land offices are established or public works\r\nare constructing under the authority of Congress,\" I transmit herewith\r\nreports from the Secretaries of the Treasury and War Departments,\r\ncontaining the information sought for.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 13, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received the resolution of the Senate of the 9th instant,\r\nrequesting me to communicate \"a copy of any report made by any director\r\nor directors of the Bank of the United States appointed by the\r\nGovernment, purporting to give information to the Executive of certain\r\nnotes and bills of exchange discounted at the Bank of the United States\r\nfor account and benefit of George Poindexter, a member of the Senate;\r\nalso the name or names of such director or directors.\"\r\n\r\nIn my replies to the resolutions of the Senate of the 11th December,\r\n1833, and of 12th of June, 1834, the former passed in their legislative\r\nand the latter in their executive capacity, I had occasion to state the\r\nobjections to requests of this nature, and to vindicate in this respect\r\nthe constitutional rights of the executive department. The views then\r\nexpressed remain unchanged, and as I think them peculiarly applicable to\r\nthe present occasion I should feel myself required to decline any reply\r\nto the resolution before me were there not reason to apprehend that\r\npersons now in nomination before the Senate might possibly by such a\r\ncourse be exposed to improper and injurious imputations.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the Senate, standing alone, would seem to be adopted\r\nwith the view of obtaining information in regard to the transactions\r\nwhich may have been had between a particular member of the Senate and\r\nthe Bank of the United States. It can, however, scarcely be supposed\r\nthat such was its object, inasmuch as the Senate have it in their power\r\nto obtain any information they may desire on this subject from their own\r\ncommittee, who have been freely allowed, as appears by their published\r\nreport, to make examinations of the books and proceedings of the bank,\r\nperemptorily denied to the Government directors, and not even allowed\r\nto the committee of the House of Representatives. It must therefore be\r\npresumed that the resolution has reference to some other matter, and on\r\nreferring to the Executive Journal of the Senate I find therein such\r\nproceedings as in my judgment fully to authorize the apprehension\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, and for the purpose of preventing\r\nmisapprehension and injustice, I think it proper to communicate herewith\r\na copy of the only report made to me by any director or directors of the\r\nBank of the United States appointed by the Government, since the report\r\nof the 19th of August, 1833, which is already in the possession of\r\nthe Senate. It will be perceived that the paper herewith transmitted\r\ncontains no information whatever as to the discounting of notes or bills\r\nof exchange for the account and benefit of the member of the Senate\r\nnamed in their resolution, nor have I at any time received from the\r\nGovernment directors any report purporting to give any such information.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 29, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report[11] from the\r\nSecretary of State, upon the subject of a resolution of the 22d instant,\r\nwhich was referred to that officer, together with the papers referred to\r\nin the said report.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Relating to commerce with Cuba and Puerto Rico.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 30, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nWith, reference to the claim of the granddaughters of the Marshal de\r\nRochambeau, and in addition to the papers formerly communicated relating\r\nto the same subject, I now transmit to the House of Representatives, for\r\ntheir consideration, a memorial to the Congress of the United States\r\nfrom the Countess d'Ambrugeac and the Marquise de la Gorée, together\r\nwith the letter which accompanied it.

Being of\r\nopinion that the residue of the dispatches of that minister can not at\r\npresent be laid before the House consistently with the public interest,\r\nI decline transmitting them. In doing so, however, I deem proper to\r\nstate that whenever any communication shall be received exhibiting any\r\nchange in the condition of the business referred to in the resolution\r\ninformation will be promptly transmitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 5, 1835_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State, to whom has been referred the resolution of the\r\nHouse of Representatives of the 31st ultimo, requesting the President\r\n\"to communicate to that House, if not incompatible with the public\r\ninterest, any correspondence with the Government of France and any\r\ndispatches received from the minister of the United States at Paris, not\r\nhitherto communicated to the House, in relation to the failure of the\r\nFrench Government to carry into effect any stipulation of the treaty\r\nof the 4th day of July, 1831,\" has the honor to report to the President\r\nthat as far as is known to the Department no correspondence has taken\r\nplace with the Government of France since that communicated to the\r\nHouse on the 27th December last. The Secretary is not aware that the\r\ndispatches received from the minister of the United States at Paris\r\npresent any material fact which does not appear in the correspondence\r\nalready transmitted. He nevertheless incloses so much of those\r\ndispatches written subsequently to the commencement of the present\r\nsession of the French Chambers as may serve to shew the state of the\r\nbusiness to which they relate since that time, and also that portion of\r\nan early dispatch which contains the substance of the assurances made to\r\nhim by His Majesty the King of the French at a formal audience granted\r\nto him for the purpose of presenting his credentials, and he submits for\r\nthe President's consideration whether the residue can consistently with\r\nthe public interest be now laid before the House.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Livingston to the Secretary of State of the United States_.\r\n\r\n[Extracts.]\r\n\r\nPARIS, _October 4, 1833_.\r\n\r\nSIR: On Monday I presented my letter of credence to the King, on which\r\noccasion I made the address to him a copy of which is inclosed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis answer was long and earnest.

One motive for delay is an expectation that the message of the\r\nPresident may arrive before the discussion, and that it may contain\r\nsomething to show a strong national feeling on the subject. _This is\r\nnot mere conjecture; I know the fact_. And I repeat now from a full\r\nknowledge of the case what I have more than once stated in my former\r\ndispatches as my firm persuasion, that the moderate tone taken by our\r\nGovernment when the rejection was first known was attributed by some\r\nto indifference or to a conviction on the part of the President that\r\nhe would not be supported in any strong measure by the people, and by\r\nothers to a consciousness that the convention had given us more than we\r\nwere entitled to ask.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI saw last night an influential member of the Chamber, who told me\r\nthat, ... and that the King had spoken of our affairs and appeared\r\nextremely anxious to secure the passage of the law. I mention this as\r\none of the many circumstances which, independent of official assurances,\r\nconvince me that the King is sincere, and now I have no doubt of the\r\nsincerity of his cabinet. From all this you may imagine the anxiety I\r\nshall feel for the arrival of the President's message. On its tone will\r\ndepend very much, not only the payment of our claims, but our national\r\nreputation for energy. I have no doubt it will be such as to attain both\r\nof these important objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Livingston to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\n[Extract.]\r\n\r\nPARIS, _December 6, 1834_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Chambers were convened on the 1st instant under very exciting\r\ncircumstances, the ministers individually and the papers supposed to\r\nspeak their language having previously announced a design to enter into\r\na full explanation of their conduct, to answer all interrogations, and\r\nplace their continuance in office on the question of approval by the\r\nChambers of their measures.\r\n\r\nThis, as you will see by the papers, they have frankly and explicitly\r\ndone, and after a warm debate of two days, which has just closed, they\r\nhave gained a decided victory. This gives them confidence, permanence,\r\nand, I hope, influence enough to carry the treaty. I shall now urge the\r\npresentation of the law at as early a day as possible, and although I do\r\nnot yet feel very certain of success, my hopes of it are naturally much\r\nincreased by the vote of this evening. The conversations I have had\r\nwith the King and with all the ministers convince me that now they are\r\nperfectly in earnest and united on the question, and that it will be\r\nurged with zeal and ability.\r\n\r\nMany of the deputies, too, with whom I have entered into explanations on\r\nthe subject, seem now convinced that the interest as well as the honor\r\nof the nation requires the fulfillment of their engagements. This gives\r\nme hopes that the endeavors I shall continue to make without ceasing\r\nuntil the question is decided may be successful.\r\n\r\nThe intimation I have conceived myself authorized to make of the serious\r\nconsequences that may be expected from another rejection of the law, and\r\nof the firm determination of our Government to admit of no reduction or\r\nchange in the treaty, I think has had an effect. On the whole, I repeat\r\nthat without being at all confident I now entertain better hopes than I\r\nhave for some time past done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Livingston to the Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n[Extracts.]\r\n\r\nPARIS, _December 22, 1834_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN FORSYTH,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State, etc._\r\n\r\nSIR: Our diplomatic relations with this Government are on the most\r\nextraordinary footing. With the executive branch I have little to\r\ndiscuss, for they agree with me in every material point on the subject\r\nof the treaty. With the legislature, where the great difficulty arises,\r\nI can have no official communication. Yet, deeply impressed with the\r\nimportance to my fellow-citizens of securing the indemnity to which\r\nthey are entitled, and to the country of enforcing the execution of\r\nengagements solemnly made to it, as well as of preventing a rupture,\r\nwhich must infallibly follow the final refusal to execute the\r\nconvention, I have felt it a duty to use every proper endeavor to\r\navoid this evil. This has been and continues to be a subject of much\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy last dispatch (6th December) was written immediately after the vote\r\nof the Chamber of Deputies had, as it was thought, secured a majority\r\nto the administration, and it naturally excited hopes which that\r\nsupposition was calculated to inspire. I soon found, however, both from\r\nthe tone of the administration press and from the language of the King\r\nand all the ministers with whom I conferred on the subject, that they\r\nwere not willing to put their popularity to the test on our question.\r\n\r\nIt will not be made one on the determination of which the ministers are\r\nwilling to risk their portfolios. The very next day after the debate the\r\nministerial gazette (Les Débats) declared that, satisfied with the\r\napprobation the Chamber had given to their system, it was at perfect\r\nliberty to exercise its discretion as to particular measures which do\r\nnot form _an essential part of that system_; and the communications I\r\nsubsequently had with the King and the ministers confirmed me in the\r\nopinion that the law for executing our convention was to be considered\r\nas one of those free questions. I combated this opinion, and asked\r\nwhether the faithful observance of treaties was not _an essential part\r\nof their_ system, and, if so, whether it did not come within their rule.\r\nWithout answering this argument, I was told of the endeavors they were\r\nmaking to secure the passage of the law by preparing the statement[12]\r\nmentioned in my former dispatch. This, it is said, is nearly finished,\r\nand from what I know of its tenor it will produce all the effect that\r\ntruth and justice can be expected to have on prejudice and party spirit.\r\n\r\nThe decision not to make it a cabinet question will not be without its\r\nfavorable operation; ... some of the leaders of the opposition, who may\r\nnot be willing to take the responsibility of a rupture between the two\r\nnations by breaking the treaty, when they are convinced that instead of\r\nforcing the ministers to resign they will themselves only incur the\r\nodium of having caused the national breach. In this view of the subject\r\nI shall be much aided if by the tenor of the President's message it is\r\nseen that we shall resent the breach of faith they contemplate.\r\n\r\nIt is on all hands conceded that it would be imprudent to press the\r\ndecision before the next month, when the exposition will be printed\r\nand laid before the Chambers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I am far from being sanguine of success in the endeavors\r\nwhich I shall not cease to make for the accomplishment of this important\r\nobject of my mission, and I expect with some solicitude the instructions\r\nfor my conduct in the probable case of a rejection of the law.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, etc.,\r\n\r\nEDW. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: A memoir to be laid before the commission which may be\r\nappointed to examine the law, intended to contain all the arguments and\r\nfacts by which it is to be supported.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 10, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received the resolution of the Senate of the 2d instant,\r\nrequesting me to communicate copies of the charges, if any, which may\r\nhave been made to me against the official conduct of Gideon Fitz, late\r\nsurveyor-general south of the State of Tennessee, which caused his\r\nremoval from office.\r\n\r\nThe resolution is preceded by a preamble which alleges as reasons for\r\nthis request that the causes which may have produced the removal of the\r\nofficer referred to may contain information necessary to the action of\r\nthe Senate on the nomination of his successor and to the investigation\r\nnow in progress respecting the frauds in the sales of the public lands.\r\n\r\nThis is another of those calls for information made upon me by the\r\nSenate which have, in my judgment, either related to the subjects\r\nexclusively belonging to the executive department or otherwise\r\nencroached on the constitutional powers of the Executive. Without\r\nconceding the right of the Senate to make either of these requests,\r\nI have yet, for the various reasons heretofore assigned in my several\r\nreplies, deemed it expedient to comply with several of them. It is now,\r\nhowever, my solemn conviction that I ought no longer, from any motive\r\nnor in any degree, to yield to these unconstitutional demands. Their\r\ncontinued repetition imposes on me, as the representative and trustee of\r\nthe American people, the painful but imperious duty of resisting to the\r\nutmost any further encroachment on the rights of the Executive. This\r\ncourse is especially due to the present resolution. The President in\r\ncases of this nature possesses the exclusive power of removal from\r\noffice, and, under the sanctions of his official oath and of his\r\nliability to impeachment, he is bound to exercise it whenever the public\r\nwelfare shall require. If, on the other hand, from corrupt motives he\r\nabuses this power, he is exposed to the same responsibilities. On no\r\nprinciple known to our institutions can he be required to account\r\nfor the manner in which he discharges this portion of his public\r\nduties, save only in the mode and under the forms prescribed by the\r\nConstitution. The suggestion that the charges a copy of which is\r\nrequested by the Senate \"may contain information necessary to their\r\naction\" on a nomination now before them can not vary the principle.\r\nThere is no necessary connection between the two subjects, and even if\r\nthere were the Senate have no right to call for that portion of these\r\nmatters which appertains to the separate and independent action of the\r\nExecutive. The intimation that these charges may also be necessary\r\n\"to the investigation now in progress respecting frauds in the sales of\r\npublic lands\" is still more insufficient to authorize the present call.\r\nThose investigations were instituted and have thus far been conducted\r\nby the Senate in their legislative capacity, and with the view, it\r\nis presumed, to some legislative action. If the President has in his\r\npossession any information on the subject of such frauds, it is his duty\r\nto communicate it to Congress, and it may undoubtedly be called for by\r\neither House sitting in its legislative capacity, though even from such\r\na call all matters properly belonging to the exclusive duties of the\r\nPresident must of necessity be exempted.\r\n\r\nThe resolution now before me purports to have been passed in executive\r\nsession, and I am bound to presume that if the information requested\r\ntherein should be communicated it would be applied in secret session to\r\n\"the investigation of frauds in the sales of the public lands.\" But,\r\nif so applied, the distinction between the executive and legislative\r\nfunctions of the Senate would not only be destroyed, but the citizen\r\nwhose conduct is impeached would lose one of his valuable securities,\r\nthat which is afforded by a public investigation in the presence of his\r\naccusers and of the witnesses against him. Besides, a compliance with\r\nthe present resolution would in all probability subject the conduct and\r\nmotives of the President in the case of Mr. Fitz to the review of the\r\nSenate when not sitting as judges on an impeachment, and even if this\r\nconsequence should not occur in the present case the compliance of the\r\nExecutive might hereafter be quoted as a precedent for similar and\r\nrepeated applications,\r\n\r\nSuch a result, if acquiesced in, would ultimately subject the\r\nindependent constitutional action of the Executive in a matter of great\r\nnational concernment to the domination and control of the Senate; if not\r\nacquiesced in, it would lead to collisions between coordinate branches\r\nof the Government, well calculated to expose the parties to indignity\r\nand reproach and to inflict on the public interest serious and lasting\r\nmischief.\r\n\r\nI therefore decline a compliance with so much of the resolution of the\r\nSenate as requests \"copies of the charges, if any,\" in relation to Mr.\r\nFitz, and in doing so must be distinctly understood as neither affirming\r\nnor denying that any such charges were made; but as the Senate may\r\nlawfully call upon the President for information properly appertaining\r\nto nominations submitted to them, I have the honor, in this respect, to\r\nreply that I have none to give them in the case of the person nominated\r\nas successor to Mr. Fitz, except that I believe him, from sources\r\nentitled to the highest credit, to be well qualified in abilities and\r\ncharacter to discharge the duties of the office in question.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 14, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI beg leave to call the attention of Congress to the accompanying\r\ncommunication from the Secretary of War, from which it appears that the\r\n\"act for the relief of Benedict Alford and Robert Brush,\" although\r\nsigned and duly certified by the proper officers as having passed the\r\ntwo Houses of Congress at their last session, had not in fact obtained\r\nthe sanction of that body when it was presented to the President for his\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it is thought that the subject is worthy of\r\nthe consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 16, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives, for their consideration, a\r\npetition to the Congress of the United States from Adelaide de Grasse\r\nde Grochamps, one of the surviving daughters of the Count de Grasse,\r\ntogether with the letter which accompanied it. Translations of these\r\npapers are also sent.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 18, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nSince my message a few days ago relating to Choctaw reservations other\r\ndocuments on the same subject have been received from the locating\r\nagent, which are mentioned in the accompanying report of the Secretary\r\nof War, and which I also transmit herewith for the information and\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 21, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate as to the\r\nratification of the same, four treaties for Potawatamie reservations,\r\nconcluded by General Marshall in December last.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 25, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a report from the Secretary of State, with copies\r\nof all the letters received from Mr. Livingston since the message to the\r\nHouse of Representatives of the 6th instant, of the instructions given\r\nto that minister, and of all the late correspondence with the French\r\nGovernment in Paris or in Washington, except a note of Mr. Sérurier,\r\nwhich, for the reasons stated in the report, is not now communicated.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that I have deemed it my duty to instruct Mr. Livingston\r\nto quit France with his legation and return to the United States if an\r\nappropriation for the fulfillment of the convention shall be refused by\r\nthe Chambers.\r\n\r\nThe subject being now in all its present aspects before Congress, whose\r\nright it is to decide what measures are to be pursued in that event, I\r\ndeem it unnecessary to make further recommendation, being confident that\r\non their part everything will be done to maintain the rights and honor\r\nof the country which the occasion requires.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 25, 1835_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State has the honor to submit to the President copies\r\nof all the letters received from Mr. Livingston since the message to the\r\nHouse of Representatives of the 6th instant, of the instructions given\r\nto that minister, and of all the late correspondence with the French\r\nGovernment in Paris or in Washington, except the last note of M.\r\nSérurier, which it has been considered necessary to submit to the\r\nGovernment of France before it is made public or answered, that it may\r\nbe ascertained whether some exceptionable expressions are to be taken\r\nas the result of a settled purpose in that Government or as the mere\r\nebullition of the minister's indiscretion.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Livingston to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\nNo. 70.\r\n\r\nLEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 11, 1835_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\nSIR: Believing that it would be important for me to receive the\r\ndispatches you might think it necessary to send with the President's\r\nmessage, I ventured on incurring the expense of a courier to bring it\r\nto me as soon as it should arrive at Havre. Mr. Beasley accordingly,\r\non the arrival of the _Sully_, dispatched a messenger with my letters\r\nreceived by that vessel, and a New York newspaper containing the\r\nmessage, but without any communication from the Department, so that\r\nyour No. 43 is still the last which I have to acknowledge. The courier\r\narrived at 2 o'clock on the morning of the 8th. Other copies were the\r\nsame morning received by the estafette, and the contents, being soon\r\nknown, caused the greatest sensation, which as yet is, I think,\r\nunfavorable--the few members of the opposition who would have voted for\r\nthe execution of the treaty now declaring that they can not do it under\r\nthe threat of reprisals, and the great body of that party making use\r\nof the effect it has on national pride to gain proselytes from the\r\nministerial side of the Chamber, in which I have no doubt they have\r\nin a great degree for the time succeeded.\r\n\r\nThe ministers are aware of this, and will not, I think, immediately\r\nurge the consideration of the law, as I have no doubt they were prepared\r\nto do when the message arrived. Should Congress propose commercial\r\nrestrictions or determine to wait to the end of the session before they\r\nact, this will be considered as a vote against reprisals, and then the\r\nlaw will be proposed and I think carried. But I ought not to conceal\r\nfrom you that the excitement is at present very great; that their pride\r\nis deeply wounded by what they call an attempt to coerce them by threats\r\nto the payment of a sum which they persist, in opposition to the\r\nplainest proof, in declaring not to be due. This feeling is fostered by\r\nthe language of our opposition papers, particularly by the Intelligencer\r\nand New York Courier, extracts from which have been sent on by\r\nAmericans, declaring them to be the sentiments of a majority of the\r\npeople. These, as you will see, are translated and republished here,\r\nwith such comments as they might have been expected and undoubtedly were\r\nintended to produce, and if hostilities should take place between the\r\ntwo countries those persons may flatter themselves with having the\r\ncredit of a great share in producing them. The only letter I have\r\nreceived from home is from one of my family. This, to my great\r\nsatisfaction, informs me that the President will be supported by\r\nall parties, and I am told that this is the language of some of the\r\nopposition papers; but as they are not sent to the legation I can not\r\ntell in what degree this support can be depended upon. Whether the\r\nenergetic language of the message will be made the pretext with some or\r\nbe the cause with others among the deputies for rejecting the law can\r\nnot, of course, be yet conjectured with any great degree of probability,\r\nbut I think it will have a good effect. It has certainly raised us in\r\nthe estimation of other powers, if I may judge from the demeanor of\r\ntheir representatives here, and my own opinion is that as soon as the\r\nfirst excitement subsides it will operate favorably on the counsels of\r\nFrance. Already some of the journals begin to change their tone, and I\r\nam much mistaken if the opposition here, finding that we are in earnest,\r\nwill incur the responsibility of a rupture between the two nations,\r\nwhich they see must take place if the treaty be rejected. The funds\r\nexperienced a considerable fall as soon as the message was known, and\r\ninsurance rose. In short, it has made them feel the commercial as well\r\nas political importance of our country.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Rigny had requested me to communicate the message to him as\r\nsoon as it should be received. This I promised to do, and accordingly on\r\nthe morning of the 8th, to avoid any mistake as to the mode of making\r\nthe communication, I carried the paper to him myself, telling him that\r\nI had received a gazette containing a paper said to be the message of\r\nthe President, which I delivered to him in compliance with my promise;\r\nbut I requested him to observe that it was not an authentic paper,\r\nnor was it delivered in pursuance of instructions, nor in my official\r\ncharacter. I thought it, for obvious reasons, necessary to be very\r\nexplicit on this point, and he properly understood me, as he had not yet\r\nread the message. Little more passed at the interview, and I thought of\r\nit, but not immediately, to seek another. I shall probably, however, see\r\nhim to-night, and shall then appoint some time for a further conference,\r\nof which I will by this same packet give you the result.\r\n\r\nMr. Middleton has just arrived from Madrid with the inscriptions for the\r\nSpanish indemnity and a draft for the first payment of interest. His\r\ninstructions are, he says, to leave them with me, but as I have heard\r\nnothing from the Department I shall advise the depositing them with\r\nRothschild to wait the directions of the President.\r\n\r\nThe importance of obtaining the earliest intelligence at this crisis of\r\nour affairs with France has induced me to direct that my letters should\r\nbe sent by the estafette from Havre, and that if any important advice\r\nshould be received at such an hour in the day as would give a courier\r\nan advance of some hours over the estafette, that a special messenger\r\nshould be dispatched with it.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, sir, your most obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nEDW. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Livingston to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\nNo. 71.\r\n\r\nLEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 14, 1835_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\nSIR: The intended conference with the minister for foreign affairs of\r\nwhich I spoke to you in my last (No. 70) took place yesterday morning. I\r\nbegan it by expressing my regret that a communication from the President\r\nto Congress had been so much misrepresented in that part which related\r\nto France as to be construed into a measure of hostilities. It was, I\r\nsaid, part of a consultation between different members of our Government\r\nas to the proper course to be pursued if the legislative body of France\r\nshould persevere in refusing to provide the means of complying with a\r\ntreaty formally made; that the President, as was his duty, stated the\r\nfacts truly and in moderate language, without any irritating comment;\r\nthat in further pursuance of his official duty he declared the different\r\nmodes of redress which the law of nations permitted in order to avoid\r\nhostilities, expressing, as he ought to do, his reasons for preferring\r\none of them; that in all this there was nothing addressed to the French\r\nnation; and I likened it to a proceeding well known in the French law\r\n(a family council in which the concerns and interests are discussed),\r\nbut of which in our case the debates were necessarily public; that a\r\nfurther elucidation of the nature of this document might be drawn from\r\nthe circumstance that no instructions had been given to communicate it\r\nto the French Government, and that if a gazette containing it had been\r\ndelivered it was at the request of his excellency, and expressly\r\ndeclared to be a private communication, not an official one. I further\r\nstated that I made this communication without instructions, merely\r\nto counteract misapprehensions and from an earnest desire to rectify\r\nerrors which might have serious consequences. I added that it was very\r\nunfortunate that an earlier call of the Chambers had not been made in\r\nconsequence of Mr. Sérurier's promise, the noncompliance with which was\r\nof a nature to cause serious disquietude with the Government of the\r\nUnited States. I found immediately that this was the part of the\r\nmessage that had most seriously affected the King, for Comte de Rigny\r\nimmediately took up the argument, endeavoring to show that the\r\nGovernment had acted in good faith, relying principally on the danger\r\nof a second rejection had the Chambers been called at an early day\r\nexpressly for this object I replied by repeating that the declaration\r\nmade by Mr. Sérurier was a positive and formal one, and that it had\r\nproduced a forbearance on the part of the President to lay the state of\r\nthe case before Congress. In this conference, which was a long one, we\r\nboth regretted that any misunderstanding should interrupt the good\r\nintelligence of two nations having so many reasons to preserve it and so\r\nfew of conflicting interests. He told me (what I knew before) that the\r\nexposition was prepared, and that the law would have been presented the\r\nday after that on which the message was received. He showed me the\r\ndocument, read part of it to me, and expressed regret that the language\r\nof the message prevented it being sent in. I said that I hoped the\r\nexcitement would soon subside and give place to better feelings, in\r\nwhich I thought he joined with much sincerity. It is perhaps necessary\r\nto add that an allusion was made by me to the change of ministry in\r\nNovember and the reinstatement of the present ministers, which I told\r\nhim I had considered as a most favorable occurrence, and that I had so\r\nexpressed myself in my communications to you, but that this circumstance\r\nwas unknown at Washington when the message was delivered; and I added\r\nthat the hopes of success held out in the communication to which I\r\nreferred and the assurances it contained that the ministers would\r\nzealously urge the adoption of the law might probably have imparted the\r\nsame hopes to the President and have induced some change in the measure\r\nhe had recommended, but that the formation of the Dupin ministry, if\r\nknown, must have had a very bad effect on the President's mind, as\r\nmany of that ministry were known to be hostile to the treaty.\r\n\r\nWhen I took leave the minister requested me to reflect on the\r\npropriety of presenting a note of our conversation, which he said should\r\nbe formal or otherwise, as I should desire. I told him I would do so,\r\nand inform him on the next morning by 11 o'clock. We parted, as I\r\nthought, on friendly terms, and in the evening, meeting him at the\r\nAustrian ambassador's, I told him that on reflection I had determined to\r\nwait the arrival of the packet of the 16th before I gave the note, to\r\nwhich he made no objection. After all this you may judge of my surprise\r\nwhen last night about 10 o'clock I received the letter copy of which is\r\ninclosed, and which necessarily closes my mission. In my reply I shall\r\ntake care to throw the responsibility of breaking up the diplomatic\r\nintercourse between the countries where it ought to rest, and will not\r\nfail to expose the misstatements which you will observe are contained in\r\nthe minister's note, both as respects my Government and myself; but the\r\nlate hour at which I received the Comte de Rigny's note and the almost\r\nimmediate departure of the packet may prevent my sending you a copy of\r\nmy communication to him, which I shall use the utmost diligence in\r\npreparing.\r\n\r\nThe law, it is said, will be presented to-day, and I have very\r\nlittle doubt that it will pass. The ministerial phalanx, reenforced by\r\nthose of the opposition (and they are not a few) who will not take the\r\nresponsibility of involving the country in the difficulties which they\r\nnow see must ensue, will be sufficient to carry the vote. The recall of\r\nSérurier and the notice to me are measures which are resorted to to save\r\nthe pride of the Government and the nation.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, sir, your most obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nEDW.

EDWARD LIVINGSTON, etc.\r\n\r\nSIR: You have well comprehended the nature of the impressions produced\r\nupon the King's Government by the message which His Excellency President\r\nJackson addressed on the 1st of December to the Congress of the United\r\nStates. Nothing certainly could have prepared us for it. Even though\r\nthe complaints expressed in it had been as just as they are in reality\r\nunjust, we should still have had a right to be astonished on receiving\r\nthe first communication of them in such a form.\r\n\r\nIn the explanations which I am now about to make I can not enter upon\r\nthe consideration of any facts other than those occurring subsequently\r\nto the vote by which the last Chamber of Deputies refused the\r\nappropriation necessary for the payment stipulated in the treaty of July\r\n4. However this vote may have been regarded by the Government of the\r\nUnited States, it is evident that by accepting (_accueillant_) the\r\npromise of the King's Government to bring on a second deliberation\r\nbefore the new legislature it had in fact postponed all discussion and\r\nall recrimination on the subject of this first refusal until another\r\ndecision should have either repealed or confirmed it. This postponement\r\ntherefore sets aside for the time all difficulties arising either justly\r\nor unjustly from the rejection of the treaty or from the delay by which\r\nit had been preceded; and although the message begins by enumerating\r\nthem, I think proper, in order to confine myself to the matter in\r\nquestion, only to reply to the imputations made on account of subsequent\r\noccurrences.\r\n\r\nThe reproaches which President Jackson considers himself authorized to\r\naddress to France may be summed up in a few words. The King's Government\r\npromised to present the treaty of July 4 again to the Chambers as soon\r\nas they could be assembled. They were assembled on the 31st of July, and\r\nthe treaty has not yet been presented to them. Such is exactly the whole\r\nsubstance of the President's argumentation, and nothing can be easier\r\nthan to refute it.\r\n\r\nI may first observe that the assembling of the Chambers on the 31st of\r\nJuly, in obedience to a legal prescription that they should be called\r\ntogether within a stated period after a dissolution of the Chamber of\r\nDeputies, was nothing more than a piece of formality, and if President\r\nJackson had attended to the internal mechanism of our administrative\r\nsystem he would have been convinced that the session of 1835 could not\r\nhave really commenced at that session of 1834. Everyone knew beforehand\r\nthat after a fortnight spent in the forms of installation it would be\r\nadjourned.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States considers that the bill relative to\r\nthe American claims should have been presented to the Chamber within\r\nthat fortnight. I can not understand the propriety of this reproach. The\r\nbill was explicitly announced in the speech from the throne on the very\r\nday on which the Chambers met. This was all that was required to make\r\nknown the opinion and design of the Government, and to prevent that\r\nspecies of moral proscription to which absolute silence would have given\r\nauthority. With regard to the mere act of presentation so long before\r\ndiscussion could possibly take place, this proceeding would have been so\r\nunusual and extraordinary that it might have increased the unfavorable\r\nprepossessions of the public, already too numerous, without producing\r\nany real advantage in return. Above all, the result which the President\r\nhad in view, of being able to announce the new vote of the Chamber of\r\nDeputies in his message, would not have been attained.\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson expresses his regrets that your solicitations\r\n(_instances_) had not determined the King's Government to call the\r\nChambers together at an earlier day. How soon soever they may have been\r\ncalled, the simplest calculation will serve to shew that the discussions\r\nin our Chambers could not have been known in the United States at the\r\nopening of Congress, and the President's regret is therefore unfounded.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the same obstacles and the same administrative reasons which\r\nrendered a real session impossible during the months of July or August\r\nwere almost equally opposed to its taking place before the last weeks\r\nof the year. The head of a government like that of the United States\r\nshould be able to comprehend more clearly than anyone else those moral\r\nimpossibilities which arise from the fixed character of the principles\r\nof a constitutional régime, and to see that in such a system the\r\nadministration is subject to constant and regular forms, from which\r\nno special interest, however important, can authorize a deviation.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, evident that far from meriting the reproach of failing\r\nto comply with its engagements, far from having deferred, either\r\nvoluntarily or from negligence, the accomplishment of its promises, the\r\nKing's Government, ever occupied in the design of fulfilling them, was\r\nonly arrested for a moment by insurmountable obstacles. This appears\r\nfrom the explanations now given, and I must add that the greater part of\r\nthem have already been presented by M. Sérurier to the Government of the\r\nUnited States, which by its silence seemed to acknowledge their full\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that on the 1st of December, the day on which\r\nPresident Jackson signed the message to Congress, and remarked with\r\nseverity that nearly a month was to elapse before the assembling of\r\nthe Chambers, they were in reality assembled in virtue of a royal\r\nordinance calling them together at a period earlier than that first\r\nproposed. Their assemblage was not indeed immediately followed by the\r\npresentment of the bill relative to the American claims, but you, sir,\r\nknow better than any other person the causes of this new delay. You\r\nyourself requested us not to endanger the success of this important\r\naffair by mingling its discussion with debates of a different nature,\r\nas their mere coincidence might have the effect of bringing other\r\ninfluences into play than those by which it should naturally be\r\ngoverned. By this request, sir, you clearly shewed that you had with\r\nyour judicious spirit correctly appreciated the situation of things and\r\nthe means of advancing the cause which you were called to defend. And\r\npermit me to add that the course which you have thought proper to adopt\r\non this point is the best justification of that which we ourselves have\r\nfor some months been pursuing in obedience to the necessities inherent\r\nin our political organization, and in order to insure as far as lies in\r\nour power the success of the new attempt which we were preparing to make\r\nin the Chamber.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the King's Government, freed from the internal\r\ndifficulties the force of which you have yourself so formally admitted,\r\nwas preparing to present the bill for giving sanction to the treaty of\r\nJuly 4, when the strange message of December 1 came and obliged it again\r\nto deliberate on the course which it should pursue.\r\n\r\nThe King's Government, though deeply wounded by imputations to which\r\nI will not give a name, having demonstrated their purely gratuitous\r\ncharacter, still does not wish to retreat absolutely from a\r\ndetermination already taken in a spirit of good faith and justice. How\r\ngreat soever may be the difficulties caused by the provocation which\r\nPresident Jackson has given, and by the irritation which it has produced\r\nin the public mind, it will ask the Chambers for an appropriation of\r\ntwenty-five millions in order to meet the engagements of July 4; but at\r\nthe same time His Majesty has considered it due to his own dignity no\r\nlonger to leave his minister exposed to hear language so offensive to\r\nFrance. M. Sérurier will receive orders to return to France.\r\n\r\nSuch, sir, are the determinations of which I am charged immediately to\r\ninform you, in order that you may make them known to the Government of\r\nthe United States and that you may yourself take those measures which\r\nmay seem to you to be the natural consequences of this communication.\r\nThe passports which you may desire are therefore at your disposition.\r\n\r\nAccept, sir, the assurance of my high consideration.\r\n\r\nDE RIGNY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Livingston to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\nNo. 72.\r\n\r\nLEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 15, 1835_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Having determined to send Mr. Brown, one of the gentlemen\r\nattached to the legation, to Havre with my dispatches, I have just time\r\nto add to them the copy of the note which I have sent to the Comte de\r\nRigny. The course indicated by it was adopted after the best reflections\r\nI could give to the subject, and I hope will meet the approbation of\r\nthe President. My first impressions were that I ought to follow my\r\ninclinations, demand my passports, and leave the Kingdom. This would at\r\nonce have freed me from a situation extremely painful and embarrassing;\r\nbut a closer attention convinced me that by so doing I should give to\r\nthe French Government the advantage they expect to derive from the\r\nequivocal terms of their note, which, as occasions might serve, they\r\nmight represent as a suggestion only, leaving upon me the responsibility\r\nof breaking up the diplomatic intercourse between the two countries if\r\nI demanded my passports; or, if I did not, and they found the course\r\nconvenient, they might call it an order to depart which I had not\r\ncomplied with. Baron Rothschild also called on me yesterday, saying that\r\nhe had conversed with the Comte de Rigny, who assured him that the note\r\nwas not intended as a notice to depart, and that he would be glad to see\r\nme on the subject. I answered that I could have no verbal explanations\r\non the subject, to which he replied that he had suggested the writing\r\na note on the subject, but that the minister had declined any written\r\ncommunication. Rothschild added that he had made an appointment with the\r\nComte de Rigny for 6 o'clock, and would see me again at night, and he\r\ncalled to say that there had been a misunderstanding as to the time of\r\nappointment, and that he had not seen Mr. de Rigny, but would see him\r\nthis morning. But in the meantime I determined on sending my note, not\r\nonly for the reasons contained in it, which appeared to me conclusive,\r\nbut because I found that the course was the correct one in diplomacy,\r\nand that to ask for a passport merely because the Government near which\r\nthe minister was accredited had suggested it would be considered as\r\ncommitting the dignity of his own; that the universal practice in such\r\ncases was to wait the order to depart, and not by a voluntary demand\r\nof passports exonerate the foreign Government from the odium and\r\nresponsibility of so violent a measure. My note will force them to take\r\ntheir ground. If the answer is that they intended only a suggestion\r\nwhich I may follow or not, as I choose, I will remain, but keep aloof\r\nuntil I receive your directions. If, on the other hand, I am told\r\nto depart, I will retire to Holland or England, and there wait the\r\nPresident's orders. In either case the derangement will be extremely\r\nexpensive and my situation very disagreeable. The law was not presented\r\nyesterday, but will be to-day, and I have been informed that it is to be\r\nintroduced by an exposé throwing all the blame of the present state of\r\nthings on Mr. Sérurier and me for not truly representing the opinions of\r\nour respective Governments. They may treat their own minister as they\r\nplease, but they shall not, without exposure, presume to judge of my\r\nconduct and make me the scapegoat for their sins. The truth is, they\r\nare sadly embarrassed. If the law should be rejected, I should not be\r\nsurprised if they anticipated our reprisals by the seizure of our\r\nvessels in port or the attack of our ships in the Mediterranean with a\r\nsuperior force. I shall without delay inform Commodore Patterson of the\r\nstate of things, that he may be on his guard, having already sent him a\r\ncopy of the message.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nEDW. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Livingston to the Count de Rigny_.\r\n\r\nLEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 14, 1835_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency COUNT DE RIGNY, etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of\r\nthe United States of America, received late last night the note of His\r\nExcellency the Count de Rigny, minister secretary of state for foreign\r\naffairs, dated the 13th instant.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned sees with great surprise as well as regret that a\r\ncommunication made by one branch of the Government of the United States\r\nto another, not addressed to that of His Majesty the King of the French,\r\nnor even communicated to it, is alleged as the motive for a measure\r\nwhich not only increases actual subjects of irritation, but which\r\nnecessarily cuts off all the usual means of restoring harmony to two\r\nnations who have the same interests, commercial and political, to unite\r\nthem, and none but factitious subjects for collision.\r\n\r\nThe grave matter in the body of his excellency's note demands and will\r\nreceive a full answer. It is to the concluding part that his attention\r\nis now requested. The undersigned, after being informed that it is the\r\nintention of His Majesty's Government to recall Mr. Sérurier, is told\r\n\"that this information is given to the undersigned in order that he may\r\ncommunicate it to his Government and in order that he may himself take\r\nthose measures which may appear to him the natural result of that\r\ncommunication, and that in consequence thereof the passports which he\r\nmight require are at his disposition.\" This phrase may be considered as\r\nan intimation of the course which, in the opinion of His Majesty's\r\nGovernment, the undersigned ought to pursue as the natural result of Mr.\r\nSérurier's recall, or it may be construed, as it seems to have been by\r\nthe public, into a direction by His Majesty's Government to the minister\r\nof the United States to cease his functions and leave the country.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary in a matter involving such grave consequences that there\r\nshould be no misunderstanding, the two categories demanding a line of\r\nconduct entirely different the one from the other.\r\n\r\nIn the first, he can take no directions or follow no suggestions\r\nbut those given by his own Government, which he has been sent here to\r\nrepresent. The recall of the minister of France on the grounds alleged\r\ncould not have been anticipated. Of course no instructions have been\r\ngiven to the undersigned on the subject, and he will not take upon\r\nhimself the responsibility which he would incur by a voluntary demand\r\nof his passports, although made on the suggestion of His Majesty's\r\nGovernment. If this be the sense of the passage in question, the duty\r\nof the undersigned can not be mistaken. He will transmit the note of\r\nHis Excellency the Comte de Rigny to his Government and wait its\r\ninstructions. Widely different will be his conduct if he is informed\r\nthat the conclusion of the Comte de Rigny's note is intended as a\r\ndirection that he should quit the French territory. This he will without\r\ndelay comply with on being so informed and on receiving the passports\r\nnecessary for his protection until he shall leave the Kingdom.\r\n\r\nLeaving the responsibility of this measure where it ought to rest, the\r\nundersigned has the honor to renew to His Excellency the Comte de Rigny\r\nthe assurance, etc.\r\n\r\nEDW'D LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Livingston to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\nNo. 73.\r\n\r\nLEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 16, 1935_.\r\n\r\nHon. J. FORSYTH, etc.\r\n\r\nSIR: The wind being unfavorable, I hope that this letter may arrive in\r\ntime for the packet.\r\n\r\nBy the inclosed semiofficial paper you will see that a law has been\r\npresented for effecting the payment of 25,000,000 francs capital to the\r\nUnited States, for which the budgets of the six years next succeeding\r\nthis are affected, and with a condition annexed that our Government\r\nshall have done nothing to affect the interests of France. It would seem\r\nfrom this that they mean to pay nothing but the capital, and that only\r\nin six years from this time; but as the law refers to the treaty for\r\nexecution of which it provides, I presume the intention of the ministry\r\ncan not be to make any change in it, and that the phraseology is in\r\nconformity to their usual forms. At any rate, I shall, notwithstanding\r\nthe situation in which I am placed in relation to this Government,\r\nendeavor to obtain some explanation on this point.\r\n\r\nThe packet of the 16th arrived, but to my great regret brought me no\r\ndispatches, and having received none subsequent to your No. 43, and that\r\nnot giving me any indication of the conduct that would be expected from\r\nme in the event of such measures as might have been expected on the\r\narrival of the President's message, I have been left altogether to the\r\nguidance of my own sense of duty under circumstances of much difficulty.\r\nI have endeavored to shape my course through them in such a way as to\r\nmaintain the dignity of my Government and preserve peace, and, if\r\npossible, restore the good understanding that existed between the two\r\ncountries. From the view of the motives of the President's message\r\ncontained in the answer of the Globe to the article in the Intelligencer\r\nI am happy in believing that the representations I have made to the\r\nComte de Rigny, as detailed in my No. 71, are those entertained by the\r\nGovernment, and that I have not, in this at least, gone further than it\r\nwould have directed me to do had I been favored with your instructions.\r\n\r\nI have no answer yet to my note to the Comte de Rigny, a copy of which\r\nwas sent by my last dispatch, nor can I form any new conjecture as to\r\nthe event.\r\n\r\nThe inclosed paper contains a notice that I had been received by the\r\nKing. This is unfounded, and shall be contradicted. I shall not in the\r\npresent state of things make my appearance at court, and only in cases\r\nwhere it is indispensable have any communication with the minister.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient, humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nEDW. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forsyth to Mr. Livingston_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 13, 1835_.\r\n\r\nEDWARD LIVINGSTON, Esq.\r\n\r\nSIR: To relieve the anxiety expressed in your late communication to the\r\nDepartment of State as to the course to be pursued in the event of the\r\nrejection by the Chamber of Deputies of the law to appropriate funds\r\nto carry into effect the treaty of 4th July, 1831, I am directed by\r\nthe President to inform you that if Congress shall adjourn without\r\nprescribing some definite course of action, as soon as it is known here\r\nthat the law of appropriation has been again rejected by the French\r\nChamber a frigate will be immediately dispatched to Havre to bring you\r\nback to the United States, with such instructions as the state of the\r\nquestion may then render necessary and proper.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, etc.,\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forsyth to Mr. Livingston_.\r\n\r\nNo. 49.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 24, 1835_.\r\n\r\nEDWARD LIVINGSTON, Esq.,\r\n\r\n_Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Your dispatches to No. 73 have been received at the Department--No.\r\n73 by yesterday's mail. Nos. 70, 71, 72 were delayed until this morning\r\nby the mismanagement of the young man to whose care they were committed\r\nby the captain of the packet _Sully_ in New York.\r\n\r\nIn the very unexpected and unpleasant position in which you have been\r\nplaced I am directed by the President to say to you that he approves of\r\nyour conduct as well becoming the representative of a Government ever\r\nslow to manifest resentment and eager only to fulfill the obligations\r\nof justice and good faith, but at the same time to inform you that he\r\nshould have felt no surprise and certainly would have expressed no\r\ndispleasure had you yielded to the impulse of national pride and at once\r\nhave quitted France, with the whole legation, on the receipt of the\r\nCount de Rigny's note of the 13th of January. M. Sérurier, having\r\nreceived his orders, has terminated his ministerial career by the\r\ntransmission of a note, a copy of which and of all the correspondence\r\nhad with him is herewith inclosed. M. Pageot has been presented to me\r\nas charged with the affairs of France on the recall of the minister.\r\n\r\nThe note of the Count de Rigny having no doubt, according to your\r\nintention, received from you an appropriate reply, it is only necessary\r\nfor me now to say that the Count is entirely mistaken in supposing that\r\nany explanations have been given here by M. Sérurier of the causes that\r\nhave led to the disregard or postponement of the engagements entered\r\ninto by France after the rejection of the appropriation by the last\r\nChamber of Deputies, and of which he was the organ. No written\r\ncommunication whatever has been made on the subject, and none verbally\r\nmade of sufficient importance to be recorded, a silence with regard to\r\nwhich could have been justly the foundation of any inference that the\r\nPresident was satisfied that the course of the French administration was\r\neither reconcilable to the assurances given him or necessary to secure\r\na majority of the Chamber of Deputies.\r\n\r\nThe last note of M. Sérurier will be the subject of separate\r\ninstructions, which will be immediately prepared and forwarded to you.\r\n\r\nIn the present position of our relations with France the President\r\ndirects that if the appropriation to execute the treaty shall be or\r\nshall have been rejected by the French legislature, you forthwith quit\r\nthe territory of France, with all the legation, and return to the United\r\nStates by the ship of war which shall be in readiness at Havre to bring\r\nyou back to your own country. If the appropriation be made, you may\r\nretire to England or Holland, leaving Mr. Barton in charge of affairs.\r\nNotify the Department of the place selected as your temporary residence\r\nand await further instructions.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Sérurier to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\n[Translation.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 23, 1835_.\r\n\r\nHon.

JOHN FORSYTH,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\nSIR: My object in asking you this morning to name the hour at which it\r\nwould suit you to receive me was in order that I might, in consequence\r\nof my recall as minister of His Majesty near the United States, present\r\nand accredit M. Pageot, the first secretary of this legation, as chargé\r\nd'affaires of the King. This presentation, which, according to usage, I\r\ncalculated on making in person, I have the honor, in compliance with the\r\ndesire expressed to me by you, to make in the form which you appear to\r\nprefer.\r\n\r\nI thank you, sir, for the facilities which you have been kind enough\r\nto afford me in the note preceding that now answered, also of this\r\nmorning's date, and which crossed the letter in which I demanded an\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to renew to you, sir, the assurance of my high\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nSÉRURIER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 28, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate of the United States a report[13] of the\r\nSecretary of State, to whom was referred the resolutions of that body\r\npassed on the 2d and 17th days of the present month, together with such\r\nportion of the correspondence and instructions requested by the said\r\nresolutions as could be transcribed within the time that has elapsed\r\nsince they were received and as can be communicated without prejudice\r\nto the public interest.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Relating to the treaty of indemnity with Spain of\r\nFebruary 17, 1834.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 3, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\n\r\nI respectfully return to the Senate, where it originated, the \"act to\r\nauthorize the Secretary of the Treasury to compromise the claims allowed\r\nby the commissioners under the treaty with the King of the Two Sicilies,\r\nconcluded October 14, 1832,\" without my signature.\r\n\r\nThe act is, in my judgment, inconsistent with the division of powers\r\nin the Constitution of the United States, as it is obviously founded on\r\nthe assumption that an act of Congress can give power to the Executive\r\nor to the head of one of the Departments to negotiate with a foreign\r\ngovernment. The debt due by the King of the Two Sicilies will, after the\r\ncommissioners have made their decision, become the private vested\r\nproperty of the citizens of the United States to whom it may be awarded.\r\nNeither the Executive nor the Legislature can properly interfere with it\r\nwithout their consent. With their consent the Executive has competent\r\nauthority to negotiate about it for them with a foreign government--an\r\nauthority Congress can not constitutionally abridge or increase.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Statutes at Large (Little, Brown & Co.), Vol. XI, p. 781.]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act of Congress of the United States of the 24th of May,\r\n1828, entitled \"An act in addition to an act entitled 'An act concerning\r\ndiscriminating duties of tonnage and impost' and to equalize the duties\r\non Prussian vessels and their cargoes,\" it is provided that, upon\r\nsatisfactory evidence being given to the President of the United States\r\nby the government of any foreign nation that no discriminating duties of\r\ntonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the said nation\r\nupon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States or upon\r\nthe produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the\r\nUnited States or from any foreign country, the President is hereby\r\nauthorized to issue his proclamation declaring that the foreign\r\ndiscriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are\r\nand shall be suspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels\r\nof the said foreign nation and the produce, manufactures, or merchandise\r\nimported into the United States in the same from the said foreign nation\r\nor from any other foreign country, the said suspension to take effect\r\nfrom the time of such notification being given to the President of the\r\nUnited States and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of\r\nvessels belonging to citizens of the United States and their cargoes,\r\nas aforesaid, shall be continued, and no longer; and\r\n\r\nWhereas satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me from His\r\nRoyal Highness the Grand Duke of Mechlenberg Schwerin, through an\r\nofficial communication of Leon Herckenrath, his consul at Charleston,\r\nin the United States, under date of the 13th April, 1835, that no\r\ndiscriminating duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied in\r\nthe ports of the Grand Duchy of Mechlenberg Schwerin upon vessels\r\nwholly belonging to citizens of the United States or upon the produce,\r\nmanufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States\r\nor from any foreign country:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Andrew Jackson, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, do hereby declare and proclaim that the foreign discriminating\r\nduties of tonnage and impost within the United States are and shall be\r\nsuspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels of the Grand\r\nDuchy of Mechlenberg Schwerin and the produce, manufactures, or\r\nmerchandise imported into the United States in the same from the said\r\nGrand Duchy or from any other foreign country, the said suspension to\r\ntake effect from the 13th day of April, 1835, above mentioned, and to\r\ncontinue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to\r\ncitizens of the United States and their cargoes, as aforesaid, shall\r\nbe continued, and no longer.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand at the city of Washington, the 28th day of April,\r\nA.D. 1835, and of the Independence of the United States the fifty-ninth.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JOHN FORSYTH,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVENTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 7, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn the discharge of my official duty the task again devolves upon\r\nme of communicating with a new Congress. The reflection that the\r\nrepresentation of the Union has been recently renewed, and that the\r\nconstitutional term of its service will expire with my own, heightens\r\nthe solicitude with which I shall attempt to lay before it the state\r\nof our national concerns and the devout hope which I cherish that its\r\nlabors to improve them may be crowned with success.\r\n\r\nYou are assembled at a period of profound interest to the American\r\npatriot. The unexampled growth and prosperity of our country having\r\ngiven us a rank in the scale of nations which removes all apprehension\r\nof danger to our integrity and independence from external foes, the\r\ncareer of freedom is before us, with an earnest from the past that if\r\ntrue to ourselves there can be no formidable obstacle in the future\r\nto its peaceful and uninterrupted pursuit. Yet, in proportion to the\r\ndisappearance of those apprehensions which attended our weakness, as\r\nonce contrasted with the power of some of the States of the Old World,\r\nshould we now be solicitous as to those which belong to the conviction\r\nthat it is to our own conduct we must look for the preservation of those\r\ncauses on which depend the excellence and the duration of our happy\r\nsystem of government.\r\n\r\nIn the example of other systems founded on the will of the people we\r\ntrace to internal dissension the influences which have so often blasted\r\nthe hopes of the friends of freedom. The social elements, which were\r\nstrong and successful when united against external danger, failed\r\nin the more difficult task of properly adjusting their own internal\r\norganization, and thus gave way the great principle of self-government.\r\nLet us trust that this admonition will never be forgotten by the\r\nGovernment or the people of the United States, and that the testimony\r\nwhich our experience thus far holds out to the great human family of the\r\npracticability and the blessings of free government will be confirmed\r\nin all time to come.\r\n\r\nWe have but to look at the state of our agriculture, manufactures, and\r\ncommerce and the unexampled increase of our population to feel the\r\nmagnitude of the trust committed to us. Never in any former period of\r\nour history have we had greater reason than we now have to be thankful\r\nto Divine Providence for the blessings of health and general prosperity.\r\nEvery branch of labor we see crowned with the most abundant rewards. In\r\nevery element of national resources and wealth and of individual comfort\r\nwe witness the most rapid and solid improvements. With no interruptions\r\nto this pleasing prospect at home which will not yield to the spirit of\r\nharmony and good will that so strikingly pervades the mass of the people\r\nin every quarter, amidst all the diversity of interest and pursuits to\r\nwhich they are attached, and with no cause of solicitude in regard to\r\nour external affairs which will not, it is hoped, disappear before\r\nthe principles of simple justice and the forbearance that mark our\r\nintercourse with foreign powers, we have every reason to feel proud\r\nof our beloved country.\r\n\r\nThe general state of our foreign relations has not materially changed\r\nsince my last annual message.\r\n\r\nIn the settlement of the question of the northeastern boundary little\r\nprogress has been made. Great Britain has declined acceding to the\r\nproposition of the United States, presented in accordance with the\r\nresolution of the Senate, unless certain preliminary conditions were\r\nadmitted, which I deemed incompatible with a satisfactory and rightful\r\nadjustment of the controversy. Waiting for some distinct proposal from\r\nthe Government of Great Britain, which has been invited, I can only\r\nrepeat the expression of my confidence that, with the strong mutual\r\ndisposition which I believe exists to make a just arrangement, this\r\nperplexing question can be settled with a due regard to the well-founded\r\npretensions and pacific policy of all the parties to it. Events are\r\nfrequently occurring on the northeastern frontier of a character to\r\nimpress upon all the necessity of a speedy and definitive termination of\r\nthe dispute. This consideration, added to the desire common to both to\r\nrelieve the liberal and friendly relations so happily existing between\r\nthe two countries from all embarrassment, will no doubt have its just\r\ninfluence upon both.\r\n\r\nOur diplomatic intercourse with Portugal has been renewed, and it is\r\nexpected that the claims of our citizens, partially paid, will be fully\r\nsatisfied as soon as the condition of the Queen's Government will permit\r\nthe proper attention to the subject of them. That Government has, I am\r\nhappy to inform you, manifested a determination to act upon the liberal\r\nprinciples which have marked our commercial policy. The happiest effects\r\nupon the future trade between the United States and Portugal are\r\nanticipated from it, and the time is not thought to be remote when a\r\nsystem of perfect reciprocity will be established.\r\n\r\nThe installments due under the convention with the King of the Two\r\nSicilies have been paid with that scrupulous fidelity by which his whole\r\nconduct has been characterized, and the hope is indulged that the\r\nadjustment of the vexed question of our claims will be followed by a\r\nmore extended and mutually beneficial intercourse between the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe internal contest still continues in Spain. Distinguished as\r\nthis struggle has unhappily been by incidents of the most sanguinary\r\ncharacter, the obligations of the late treaty of indemnification with us\r\nhave been, nevertheless, faithfully executed by the Spanish Government.\r\n\r\nNo provision having been made at the last session of Congress\r\nfor the ascertainment of the claims to be paid and the apportionment\r\nof the funds under the convention made with Spain, I invite your early\r\nattention to the subject. The public evidences of the debt have,\r\naccording to the terms of the convention and in the forms prescribed by\r\nit, been placed in the possession of the United States, and the interest\r\nas it fell due has been regularly paid upon them. Our commercial\r\nintercourse with Cuba stands as regulated by the act of Congress.\r\nNo recent information has been received as to the disposition of the\r\nGovernment of Madrid on this subject, and the lamented death of our\r\nrecently appointed minister on his way to Spain, with the pressure of\r\ntheir affairs at home, renders it scarcely probable that any change is\r\nto be looked for during the coming year. Further portions of the Florida\r\narchives have been sent to the United States, although the death of one\r\nof the commissioners at a critical moment embarrassed the progress of\r\nthe delivery of them. The higher officers of the local government have\r\nrecently shewn an anxious desire, in compliance with the orders from the\r\nparent Government, to facilitate the selection and delivery of all we\r\nhave a right to claim.\r\n\r\nNegotiations have been opened at Madrid for the establishment of a\r\nlasting peace between Spain and such of the Spanish American Governments\r\nof this hemisphere as have availed themselves of the intimation given\r\nto all of them of the disposition of Spain to treat upon the basis of\r\ntheir entire independence. It is to be regretted that simultaneous\r\nappointments by all of ministers to negotiate with Spain had not been\r\nmade. The negotiation itself would have been simplified, and this\r\nlong-standing dispute, spreading over a large portion of the world,\r\nwould have been brought to a more speedy conclusion.\r\n\r\nOur political and commercial relations with Austria, Prussia, Sweden,\r\nand Denmark stand on the usual favorable bases. One of the articles of\r\nour treaty with Russia in relation to the trade on the northwest coast\r\nof America having expired, instructions have been given to our minister\r\nat St. Petersburg to negotiate a renewal of it. The long and unbroken\r\namity between the two Governments gives every reason for supposing the\r\narticle will be renewed, if stronger motives do not exist to prevent\r\nit than with our view of the subject can be anticipated here.\r\n\r\nI ask your attention to the message of my predecessor at the opening\r\nof the second session of the Nineteenth Congress, relative to our\r\ncommercial intercourse with Holland, and to the documents connected with\r\nthat subject, communicated to the House of Representatives on the 10th\r\nof January, 1825, and 18th of January, 1827. Coinciding in the opinion\r\nof my predecessor that Holland is not, under the regulations of her\r\npresent system, entitled to have her vessels and their cargoes received\r\ninto the United States on the footing of American vessels and cargoes as\r\nregards duties of tonnage and impost, a respect for his reference of it\r\nto the Legislature has alone prevented me from acting on the subject. I\r\nshould still have waited without comment for the action of Congress, but\r\nrecently a claim has been made by Belgian subjects to admission into our\r\nports for their ships and cargoes on the same footing as American, with\r\nthe allegation we could not dispute that our vessels received in their\r\nports the identical treatment shewn to them in the ports of Holland,\r\nupon whose vessels no discrimination is made in the ports of the United\r\nStates. Giving the same privileges the Belgians expected the same\r\nbenefits---benefits that were, in fact, enjoyed when Belgium and Holland\r\nwere united under one Government. Satisfied with the justice of their\r\npretension to be placed on the same footing with Holland, I could not,\r\nnevertheless, without disregard to the principle of our laws, admit\r\ntheir claim to be treated as Americans, and at the same time a respect\r\nfor Congress, to whom the subject had long since been referred, has\r\nprevented me from producing a just equality by taking from the vessels\r\nof Holland privileges conditionally granted by acts of Congress,\r\nalthough the condition upon which the grant was made has, in my\r\njudgment, failed since 1822. I recommend, therefore, a review of the\r\nact of 1824, and such a modification of it as will produce an equality\r\non such terms as Congress shall think best comports with our settled\r\npolicy and the obligations of justice to two friendly powers.\r\n\r\nWith the Sublime Porte and all the Governments on the coast of Barbary\r\nour relations continue to be friendly. The proper steps have been taken\r\nto renew our treaty with Morocco.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine Republic has again promised to send within the current\r\nyear a minister to the United States.\r\n\r\nA convention with Mexico for extending the time for the appointment of\r\ncommissioners to run the boundary line has been concluded and will be\r\nsubmitted to the Senate. Recent events in that country have awakened\r\nthe liveliest solicitude in the United States. Aware of the strong\r\ntemptations existing and powerful inducements held out to the citizens\r\nof the United States to mingle in the dissensions of our immediate\r\nneighbors, instructions have been given to the district attorneys of\r\nthe United States where indications warranted it to prosecute without\r\nrespect to persons all who might attempt to violate the obligations of\r\nour neutrality, while at the same time it has been thought necessary to\r\napprise the Government of Mexico that we should require the integrity\r\nof our territory to be scrupulously respected by both parties.\r\n\r\nFrom our diplomatic agents in Brazil, Chile, Peru, Central America,\r\nVenezuela, and New Granada constant assurances are received of the\r\ncontinued good understanding with the Governments to which they are\r\nseverally accredited. With those Governments upon which our citizens\r\nhave valid and accumulating claims, scarcely an advance toward a\r\nsettlement of them is made, owing mainly to their distracted state or to\r\nthe pressure of imperative domestic questions. Our patience has been and\r\nwill probably be still further severely tried, but our fellow-citizens\r\nwhose interests are involved may confide in the determination of the\r\nGovernment to obtain for them eventually ample retribution.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, many of the nations of this hemisphere are still\r\nself-tormented by domestic dissensions. Revolution succeeds revolution;\r\ninjuries are committed upon foreigners engaged in lawful pursuits; much\r\ntime elapses before a government sufficiently stable is erected to\r\njustify expectation of redress; ministers are sent and received, and\r\nbefore the discussions of past injuries are fairly begun fresh troubles\r\narise; but too frequently new injuries are added to the old, to be\r\ndiscussed together with the existing government after it has proved its\r\nability to sustain the assaults made upon it, or with its successor if\r\noverthrown. If this unhappy condition of things continues much longer,\r\nother nations will be under the painful necessity of deciding whether\r\njustice to their suffering citizens does not require a prompt redress of\r\ninjuries by their own power, without waiting for the establishment of a\r\ngovernment competent and enduring enough to discuss and to make\r\nsatisfaction for them.\r\n\r\nSince the last session of Congress the validity of our claims upon\r\nFrance, as liquidated by the treaty of 1831, has been acknowledged by\r\nboth branches of her legislature, and the money has been appropriated\r\nfor their discharge; but the payment is, I regret to inform you, still\r\nwithheld.\r\n\r\nA brief recapitulation of the most important incidents in this\r\nprotracted controversy will shew how utterly untenable are the grounds\r\nupon which this course is attempted to be justified.\r\n\r\nOn entering upon the duties of my station I found the United States an\r\nunsuccessful applicant to the justice of France for the satisfaction of\r\nclaims the validity of which was never questionable, and has now been\r\nmost solemnly admitted by France herself. The antiquity of these claims,\r\ntheir high justice, and the aggravating circumstances out of which they\r\narose are too familiar to the American people to require description.\r\nIt is sufficient to say that for a period of ten years and upward our\r\ncommerce was, with but little interruption, the subject of constant\r\naggressions on the part of France--aggressions the ordinary features of\r\nwhich were condemnations of vessels and cargoes under arbitrary decrees,\r\nadopted in contravention as well of the laws of nations as of treaty\r\nstipulations, burnings on the high seas, and seizures and confiscations\r\nunder special imperial rescripts in the ports of other nations occupied\r\nby the armies or under the control of France. Such it is now conceded\r\nis the character of the wrongs we suffered--wrongs in many cases so\r\nflagrant that even their authors never denied our right to reparation.\r\nOf the extent of these injuries some conception may be formed from the\r\nfact that after the burning of a large amount at sea and the necessary\r\ndeterioration in other cases by long detention the American property so\r\nseized and sacrificed at forced sales, excluding what was adjudged to\r\nprivateers before or without condemnation, brought into the French\r\ntreasury upward of 24,000,000 francs, besides large custom-house duties.\r\n\r\nThe subject had already been an affair of twenty years' uninterrupted\r\nnegotiation, except for a short time when France was overwhelmed by\r\nthe military power of united Europe. During this period, whilst other\r\nnations were extorting from her payment of their claims at the point of\r\nthe bayonet, the United States intermitted their demand for justice out\r\nof respect to the oppressed condition of a gallant people to whom they\r\nfelt under obligations for fraternal assistance in their own days\r\nof suffering and of peril. The bad effects of these protracted and\r\nunavailing discussions, as well upon our relations with France as upon\r\nour national character, were obvious, and the line of duty was to my\r\nmind equally so. This was either to insist upon the adjustment of our\r\nclaims within a reasonable period or to abandon them altogether. I could\r\nnot doubt that by this course the interests and honor of both countries\r\nwould be best consulted. Instructions were therefore given in this\r\nspirit to the minister who was sent out once more to demand reparation.\r\nUpon the meeting of Congress in December, 1829, I felt it my duty to\r\nspeak of these claims and the delays of France in terms calculated to\r\ncall the serious attention of both countries to the subject. The then\r\nFrench ministry took exception to the message on the ground of its\r\ncontaining a menace, under which it was not agreeable to the French\r\nGovernment to negotiate. The American minister of his own accord refuted\r\nthe construction which was attempted to be put upon the message and at\r\nthe same time called to the recollection of the French ministry that\r\nthe President's message was a communication addressed, not to foreign\r\ngovernments, but to the Congress of the United States, in which it\r\nwas enjoined upon him by the Constitution to lay before that body\r\ninformation of the state of the Union, comprehending its foreign as well\r\nas its domestic relations, and that if in the discharge of this duty he\r\nfelt it incumbent upon him to summon the attention of Congress in due\r\ntime to what might be the possible consequences of existing difficulties\r\nwith any foreign government, he might fairly be supposed to do so under\r\na sense of what was due from him in a frank communication with another\r\nbranch of his own Government, and not from any intention of holding\r\na menace over a foreign power. The views taken by him received my\r\napprobation, the French Government was satisfied, and the negotiation\r\nwas continued. It terminated in the treaty of July 4, 1831, recognizing\r\nthe justice of our claims in part and promising payment to the amount\r\nof 25,000,000 francs in six annual installments.\r\n\r\nThe ratifications of this treaty were exchanged at Washington on the\r\n2d of February, 1832, and in five days thereafter it was laid before\r\nCongress, who immediately passed the acts necessary on our part to\r\nsecure to France the commercial advantages conceded to her in the\r\ncompact. The treaty had previously been solemnly ratified by the King of\r\nthe French in terms which are certainly not mere matters of form, and of\r\nwhich the translation is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  We, approving the above convention in all and each of the dispositions\r\n  which are contained in it, do declare, by ourselves as well as by our\r\n  heirs and successors, that it is accepted, approved, ratified, and\r\n  confirmed, and by these presents, signed by our hand, we do accept,\r\n  approve, ratify, and confirm it; promising, on the faith and word of a\r\n  king, to observe it and to cause it to be observed inviolably, without\r\n  ever contravening it or suffering it to be contravened, directly or\r\n  indirectly, for any cause or under any pretense whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial information of the exchange of ratifications in the\r\nUnited States reached Paris whilst the Chambers were in session. The\r\nextraordinary and to us injurious delays of the French Government in\r\ntheir action upon the subject of its fulfillment have been heretofore\r\nstated to Congress, and I have no disposition to enlarge upon them here.\r\nIt is sufficient to observe that the then pending session was allowed to\r\nexpire without even an effort to obtain the necessary appropriations;\r\nthat the two succeeding ones were also suffered to pass away without\r\nanything like a serious attempt to obtain a decision upon the subject,\r\nand that it was not until the fourth session, almost three years after\r\nthe conclusion of the treaty and more than two years after the exchange\r\nof ratifications, that the bill for the execution of the treaty was\r\npressed to a vote and rejected.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Government of the United States, having full\r\nconfidence that a treaty entered into and so solemnly ratified by the\r\nFrench King would be executed in good faith, and not doubting that\r\nprovision would be made for the payment of the first installment which\r\nwas to become due on the 2d day of February, 1833, negotiated a draft\r\nfor the amount through the Bank of the United States. When this draft\r\nwas presented by the holder with the credentials required by the treaty\r\nto authorize him to receive the money, the Government of France allowed\r\nit to be protested. In addition to the injury in the nonpayment of the\r\nmoney by France, conformably to her engagement, the United States were\r\nexposed to a heavy claim on the part of the bank under pretense of\r\ndamages, in satisfaction of which that institution seized upon and still\r\nretains an equal amount of the public money. Congress was in session\r\nwhen the decision of the Chambers reached Washington, and an immediate\r\ncommunication of this apparently final decision of France not to fulfill\r\nthe stipulations of the treaty was the course naturally to be expected\r\nfrom the President. The deep tone of dissatisfaction which pervaded the\r\npublic mind and the correspondent excitement produced in Congress by\r\nonly a general knowledge of the result rendered it more than probable\r\nthat a resort to immediate measures of redress would be the consequence\r\nof calling the attention of that body to the subject. Sincerely desirous\r\nof preserving the pacific relations which had so long existed between\r\nthe two countries, I was anxious to avoid this course if I could be\r\nsatisfied that by doing so neither the interests nor the honor of my\r\ncountry would be compromitted. Without the fullest assurances upon that\r\npoint, I could not hope to acquit myself of the responsibility to be\r\nincurred in suffering Congress to adjourn without laying the subject\r\nbefore them. Those received by me were believed to be of that character.\r\n\r\nThat the feelings produced in the United States by the news of the\r\nrejection of the appropriation would be such as I have described them\r\nto have been was foreseen by the French Government, and prompt measures\r\nwere taken by it to prevent the consequences. The King in person\r\nexpressed through our minister at Paris his profound regret at the\r\ndecision of the Chambers, and promised to send forthwith a national\r\nship with dispatches to his minister here authorizing him to give such\r\nassurances as would satisfy the Government and people of the United\r\nStates that the treaty would yet be faithfully executed by France.\r\nThe national ship arrived, and the minister received his instructions.\r\nClaiming to act under the authority derived from them, he gave to this\r\nGovernment in the name of his the most solemn assurances that as soon\r\nafter the new elections as the charter would permit the French\r\nChambers would be convened and the attempt to procure the necessary\r\nappropriations renewed; that all the constitutional powers of the King\r\nand his ministers should be put in requisition to accomplish the object,\r\nand he was understood, and so expressly informed by this Government at\r\nthe time, to engage that the question should be pressed to a decision at\r\na period sufficiently early to permit information of the result to be\r\ncommunicated to Congress at the commencement of their next session.\r\nRelying upon these assurances, I incurred the responsibility, great\r\nas I regarded it to be, of suffering Congress to separate without\r\ncommunicating with them upon the subject.\r\n\r\nThe expectations justly founded upon the promises thus solemnly made to\r\nthis Government by that of France were not realized. The French Chambers\r\nmet on the 31st of July, 1834, soon after the election, and although our\r\nminister in Paris urged the French ministry to bring the subject before\r\nthem, they declined doing so. He next insisted that the Chambers, if\r\nprorogued without acting on the subject, should be reassembled at a\r\nperiod so early that their action on the treaty might be known in\r\nWashington prior to the meeting of Congress. This reasonable request\r\nwas not only declined, but the Chambers were prorogued to the 29th of\r\nDecember, a day so late that their decision, however urgently pressed,\r\ncould not in all probability be obtained in time to reach Washington\r\nbefore the necessary adjournment of Congress by the Constitution. The\r\nreasons given by the ministry for refusing to convoke the Chambers at\r\nan earlier period were afterwards shewn not to be insuperable by their\r\nactual convocation on the 1st of December under a special call for\r\ndomestic purposes, which fact, however, did not become known to this\r\nGovernment until after the commencement of the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\nThus disappointed in our just expectations, it became my imperative\r\nduty to consult with Congress in regard to the expediency of a resort\r\nto retaliatory measures in case the stipulations of the treaty should\r\nnot be speedily complied with, and to recommend such as in my judgment\r\nthe occasion called for. To this end an unreserved communication of the\r\ncase in all its aspects became indispensable. To have shrunk in making\r\nit from saying all that was necessary to its correct understanding,\r\nand that the truth would justify, for fear of giving offense to\r\nothers, would have been unworthy of us. To have gone, on the other\r\nhand, a single step further for the purpose of wounding the pride of a\r\nGovernment and people with whom we had so many motives for cultivating\r\nrelations of amity and reciprocal advantage would have been unwise and\r\nimproper. Admonished by the past of the difficulty of making even the\r\nsimplest statement of our wrongs without disturbing the sensibilities of\r\nthose who had by their position become responsible for their redress,\r\nand earnestly desirous of preventing further obstacles from that source,\r\nI went out of my way to preclude a construction of the message by which\r\nthe recommendation that was made to Congress might be regarded as a\r\nmenace to France in not only disavowing such a design, but in declaring\r\nthat her pride and her power were too well known to expect anything from\r\nher fears. The message did not reach Paris until more than a month after\r\nthe Chambers had been in session, and such was the insensibility of the\r\nministry to our rightful claims and just expectations that our minister\r\nhad been informed that the matter when introduced would not be pressed\r\nas a cabinet measure.\r\n\r\nAlthough the message was not officially communicated to the French\r\nGovernment, and notwithstanding the declaration to the contrary which\r\nit contained, the French ministry decided to consider the conditional\r\nrecommendation of reprisals a menace and an insult which the honor of\r\nthe nation made it incumbent on them to resent. The measures resorted\r\nto by them to evince their sense of the supposed indignity were the\r\nimmediate recall of their minister at Washington, the offer of passports\r\nto the American minister at Paris, and a public notice to the\r\nlegislative Chambers that all diplomatic intercourse with the United\r\nStates had been suspended. Having in this manner vindicated the dignity\r\nof France, they next proceeded to illustrate her justice. To this end a\r\nbill was immediately introduced into the Chamber of Deputies proposing\r\nto make the appropriations necessary to carry into effect the treaty.\r\nAs this bill subsequently passed into a law, the provisions of which\r\nnow constitute the main subject of difficulty between the two nations,\r\nit becomes my duty, in order to place the subject before you in a clear\r\nlight, to trace the history of its passage and to refer with some\r\nparticularity to the proceedings and discussions in regard to it.\r\n\r\nThe minister of finance in his opening speech alluded to the measures\r\nwhich had been adopted to resent the supposed indignity, and recommended\r\nthe execution of the treaty as a measure required by the honor and\r\njustice of France. He as the organ of the ministry declared the message,\r\nso long as it had not received the sanction of Congress, a mere\r\nexpression of the personal opinion of the President, for which neither\r\nthe Government nor people of the United States were responsible, and\r\nthat an engagement had been entered into for the fulfillment of which\r\nthe honor of France was pledged. Entertaining these views, the single\r\ncondition which the French ministry proposed to annex to the payment of\r\nthe money was that it should not be made until it was ascertained that\r\nthe Government of the United States had done nothing to injure the\r\ninterests of France, or, in other words, that no steps had been\r\nauthorized by Congress of a hostile character toward France.\r\n\r\nWhat the disposition or action of Congress might be was then unknown to\r\nthe French cabinet; but on the 14th of January the Senate resolved that\r\nit was at that time inexpedient to adopt any legislative measures in\r\nregard to the state of affairs between the United States and France, and\r\nno action on the subject had occurred in the House of Representatives.\r\nThese facts were known in Paris prior to the 28th of March, 1835, when\r\nthe committee to whom the bill of indemnification had been referred\r\nreported it to the Chamber of Deputies. That committee substantially\r\nreechoed the sentiments of the ministry, declared that Congress had set\r\naside the proposition of the President, and recommended the passage of\r\nthe bill without any other restriction than that originally proposed.\r\nThus was it known to the French ministry and Chambers that if the\r\nposition assumed by them, and which had been so frequently and solemnly\r\nannounced as the only one compatible with the honor of France, was\r\nmaintained and the bill passed as originally proposed, the money would\r\nbe paid and there would be an end of this unfortunate controversy.\r\n\r\nBut this cheering prospect was soon destroyed by an amendment introduced\r\ninto the bill at the moment of its passage, providing that the money\r\nshould not be paid until the French Government had received satisfactory\r\nexplanations of the President's message of the 2d December, 1834, and,\r\nwhat is still more extraordinary, the president of the council of\r\nministers adopted this amendment and consented to its incorporation\r\nin the bill. In regard to a supposed insult which had been formally\r\nresented by the recall of their minister and the offer of passports\r\nto ours, they now for the first time proposed to ask explanations.\r\nSentiments and propositions which they had declared could not justly\r\nbe imputed to the Government or people of the United States are set up\r\nas obstacles to the performance of an act of conceded justice to that\r\nGovernment and people. They had declared that the honor of France\r\nrequired the fulfillment of the engagement into which the King had\r\nentered, unless Congress adopted the recommendations of the message.\r\nThey ascertained that Congress did not adopt them, and yet that\r\nfulfillment is refused unless they first obtain from the President\r\nexplanations of an opinion characterized by themselves as personal\r\nand inoperative.\r\n\r\nThe conception that it was my intention to menace or insult the\r\nGovernment of France is as unfounded as the attempt to extort from the\r\nfears of that nation what her sense of justice may deny would be vain\r\nand ridiculous. But the Constitution of the United States imposes on\r\nthe President the duty of laying before Congress the condition of the\r\ncountry in its foreign and domestic relations, and of recommending such\r\nmeasures as may in his opinion be required by its interests. From the\r\nperformance of this duty he can not be deterred by the fear of wounding\r\nthe sensibilities of the people or government of whom it may become\r\nnecessary to speak; and the American people are incapable of submitting\r\nto an interference by any government on earth, however powerful, with\r\nthe free performance of the domestic duties which the Constitution has\r\nimposed on their public functionaries. The discussions which intervene\r\nbetween the several departments of our Government belong to ourselves,\r\nand for anything said in them our public servants are only responsible\r\nto their own constituents and to each other. If in the course of their\r\nconsultations facts are erroneously stated or unjust deductions are\r\nmade, they require no other inducement to correct them, however informed\r\nof their error, than their love of justice and what is due to their own\r\ncharacter; but they can never submit to be interrogated upon the subject\r\nas a matter of right by a foreign power. When our discussions terminate\r\nin acts, our responsibility to foreign powers commences, not as\r\nindividuals, but as a nation. The principle which calls in question\r\nthe President for the language of his message would equally justify a\r\nforeign power in demanding explanation of the language used in the\r\nreport of a committee or by a member in debate.\r\n\r\nThis is not the first time that the Government of France has taken\r\nexception to the messages of American Presidents. President Washington\r\nand the first President Adams in the performance of their duties to the\r\nAmerican people fell under the animadversions of the French Directory.\r\nThe objection taken by the ministry of Charles X, and removed by the\r\nexplanations made by our minister upon the spot, has already been\r\nadverted to. When it was understood that the ministry of the present\r\nKing took exception to my message of last year, putting a construction\r\nupon it which was disavowed on its face, our late minister at Paris,\r\nin answer to the note which first announced a dissatisfaction with\r\nthe language used in the message, made a communication to the French\r\nGovernment under date of the 29th of January, 1835,[14] calculated to\r\nremove all impressions which an unreasonable susceptibility had created.\r\nHe repeated and called the attention of the French Government to the\r\ndisavowal contained in the message itself of any intention to intimidate\r\nby menace; he truly declared that it contained and was intended to\r\ncontain no charge of ill faith against the King of the French, and\r\nproperly distinguished between the right to complain in unexceptionable\r\nterms of the omission to execute an agreement and an accusation of\r\nbad motives in withholding such execution, and demonstrated that the\r\nnecessary use of that right ought not to be considered as an offensive\r\nimputation. Although this communication was made without instructions\r\nand entirely on the minister's own responsibility, yet it was afterwards\r\nmade the act of this Government by my full approbation, and that\r\napprobation was officially made known on the 25th of April, 1835, to\r\nthe French Government. It, however, failed to have any effect. The law,\r\nafter this friendly explanation, passed with the obnoxious amendment,\r\nsupported by the King's ministers, and was finally approved by the King.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States are justly attached to a pacific\r\nsystem in their intercourse with foreign nations. It is proper,\r\ntherefore, that they should know whether their Government has adhered\r\nto it. In the present instance it has been carried to the utmost extent\r\nthat was consistent with a becoming self-respect. The note of the 29th\r\nof January, to which I have before alluded, was not the only one which\r\nour minister took upon himself the responsibility of presenting on the\r\nsame subject and in the same spirit. Finding that it was intended to\r\nmake the payment of a just debt dependent on the performance of a\r\ncondition which he knew could never be complied with, he thought it a\r\nduty to make another attempt to convince the French Government that\r\nwhilst self-respect and regard to the dignity of other nations would\r\nalways prevent us from using any language that ought to give offense,\r\nyet we could never admit a right in any foreign government to ask\r\nexplanations of or to interfere in any manner in the communications\r\nwhich one branch of our public councils made with another; that in\r\nthe present case no such language had been used, and that this had\r\nin a former note been fully and voluntarily stated, before it was\r\ncontemplated to make the explanation a condition; and that there might\r\nbe no misapprehension he stated the terms used in that note, and he\r\nofficially informed them that it had been approved by the President,\r\nand that therefore every explanation which could reasonably be asked or\r\nhonorably given had been already made; that the contemplated measure\r\nhad been anticipated by a voluntary and friendly declaration, and was\r\ntherefore not only useless, but might be deemed offensive, and certainly\r\nwould not be complied with if annexed as a condition.\r\n\r\nWhen this latter communication, to which I especially invite the\r\nattention of Congress, was laid before me, I entertained the hope that\r\nthe means it was obviously intended to afford of an honorable and speedy\r\nadjustment of the difficulties between the two nations would have been\r\naccepted, and I therefore did not hesitate to give it my sanction and\r\nfull approbation. This was due to the minister who had made himself\r\nresponsible for the act, and it was published to the people of the\r\nUnited States and is now laid before their representatives to shew\r\nhow far their Executive has gone in its endeavors to restore a good\r\nunderstanding between the two countries. It would have been at any\r\ntime communicated to the Government of France had it been officially\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\nThe French Government having received all the explanation which honor\r\nand principle permitted, and which could in reason be asked, it was\r\nhoped it would no longer hesitate to pay the installments now due.\r\nThe agent authorized to receive the money was instructed to inform the\r\nFrench minister of his readiness to do so. In reply to this notice he\r\nwas told that the money could not then be paid, because the formalities\r\nrequired by the act of the Chambers had not been arranged.\r\n\r\nNot having received any official information of the intentions of the\r\nFrench Government, and anxious to bring, as far as practicable, this\r\nunpleasant affair to a close before the meeting of Congress, that you\r\nmight have the whole subject before you, I caused our chargé d'affaires\r\nat Paris to be instructed to ask for the final determination of the\r\nFrench Government, and in the event of their refusal to pay the\r\ninstallments now due, without further explanations to return to the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe result of this last application has not yet reached us, but is daily\r\nexpected. That it may be favorable is my sincere wish. France having\r\nnow, through all the branches of her Government, acknowledged the\r\nvalidity of our claims and the obligation of the treaty of 1831, and\r\nthere really existing no adequate cause for further delay, will at\r\nlength, it may be hoped, adopt the course which the interests of both\r\nnations, not less than the principles of justice, so imperiously\r\nrequire. The treaty being once executed on her part, little will remain\r\nto disturb the friendly relations of the two countries--nothing, indeed,\r\nwhich will not yield to the suggestions of a pacific and enlightened\r\npolicy and to the influence of that mutual good will and of those\r\ngenerous recollections which we may confidently expect will then be\r\nrevived in all their ancient force. In any event, however, the principle\r\ninvolved in the new aspect which has been given to the controversy is so\r\nvitally important to the independent administration of the Government\r\nthat it can neither be surrendered nor compromitted without national\r\ndegradation. I hope it is unnecessary for me to say that such a\r\nsacrifice will not be made through any agency of mine. The honor of my\r\ncountry shall never be stained by an apology from me for the statement\r\nof truth and the performance of duty; nor can I give any explanation\r\nof my official acts except such as is due to integrity and justice\r\nand consistent with the principles on which our institutions have\r\nbeen framed. This determination will, I am confident, be approved\r\nby my constituents. I have, indeed, studied their character to but\r\nlittle purpose if the sum of 25,000,000 francs will have the weight\r\nof a feather in the estimation of what appertains to their national\r\nindependence, and if, unhappily, a different impression should at any\r\ntime obtain in any quarter, they will, I am sure, rally round the\r\nGovernment of their choice with alacrity and unanimity, and silence\r\nforever the degrading imputation.\r\n\r\nHaving thus frankly presented to you the circumstances which since the\r\nlast session of Congress have occurred in this interesting and important\r\nmatter, with the views of the Executive in regard to them, it is at this\r\ntime only necessary to add that whenever the advices now daily expected\r\nfrom our chargé d'affaires shall have been received they will be made\r\nthe subject of a special communication.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the public finances was never more flattering than at\r\nthe present period.\r\n\r\nSince my last annual communication all the remains of the public\r\ndebt have been redeemed, or money has been placed in deposit for this\r\npurpose whenever the creditors choose to receive it. All the other\r\npecuniary engagements of the Government have been honorably and promptly\r\nfulfilled, and there will be a balance in the Treasury at the close of\r\nthe present year of about $19,000,000. It is believed that after meeting\r\nall outstanding and unexpended appropriations there will remain near\r\neleven millions to be applied to any new objects which Congress may\r\ndesignate or to the more rapid execution of the works already in\r\nprogress. In aid of these objects, and to satisfy the current\r\nexpenditures of the ensuing year, it is estimated that there will\r\nbe received from various sources twenty millions more in 1836.\r\n\r\nShould Congress make new appropriations in conformity with the estimates\r\nwhich will be submitted from the proper Departments, amounting to about\r\ntwenty-four millions, still the available surplus at the close of the\r\nnext year, after deducting all unexpended appropriations, will probably\r\nnot be less than six millions. This sum can, in my judgment, be now\r\nusefully applied to proposed improvements in our navy-yards, and to new\r\nnational works which are not enumerated in the present estimates or\r\nto the more rapid completion of those already begun. Either would be\r\nconstitutional and useful, and would render unnecessary any attempt\r\nin our present peculiar condition to divide the surplus revenue or to\r\nreduce it any faster than will be effected by the existing laws. In\r\nany event, as the annual report from the Secretary of the Treasury will\r\nenter into details, shewing the probability of some decrease in the\r\nrevenue during the next seven years and a very considerable deduction in\r\n1842, it is not recommended that Congress should undertake to modify the\r\npresent tariff so as to disturb the principles on which the compromise\r\nact was passed. Taxation on some of the articles of general consumption\r\nwhich are not in competition with our own productions may be no doubt so\r\ndiminished as to lessen to some extent the source of this revenue, and\r\nthe same object can also be assisted by more liberal provisions for the\r\nsubjects of public defense, which in the present state of our prosperity\r\nand wealth may be expected to engage your attention. If, however, after\r\nsatisfying all the demands which can arise from these sources the\r\nunexpended balance in the Treasury should still continue to increase,\r\nit would be better to bear with the evil until the great changes\r\ncontemplated in our tariff laws have occurred and shall enable us to\r\nrevise the system with that care and circumspection which are due to\r\nso delicate and important a subject.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly our duty to diminish as far as we can the burdens of\r\ntaxation and to regard all the restrictions which are imposed on the\r\ntrade and navigation of our citizens as evils which we shall mitigate\r\nwhenever we are not prevented by the adverse legislation and policy\r\nof foreign nations or those primary duties which the defense and\r\nindependence of our country enjoin upon us. That we have accomplished\r\nmuch toward the relief of our citizens by the changes which have\r\naccompanied the payment of the public debt and the adoption of the\r\npresent revenue laws is manifest from the fact that compared with 1833\r\nthere is a diminution of near twenty-five millions in the last two\r\nyears, and that our expenditures, independently of those for the public\r\ndebt, have been reduced near nine millions during the same period. Let\r\nus trust that by the continued observance of economy and by harmonizing\r\nthe great interests of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce much\r\nmore may be accomplished to diminish the burdens of government and to\r\nincrease still further the enterprise and the patriotic affection of all\r\nclasses of our citizens and all the members of our happy Confederacy.\r\nAs the data which the Secretary of the Treasury will lay before you in\r\nregard to our financial resources are full and extended, and will afford\r\na safe guide in your future calculations, I think it unnecessary to\r\noffer any further observations on that subject here.\r\n\r\nAmong the evidences of the increasing prosperity of the country, not\r\nthe least gratifying is that afforded by the receipts from the sales of\r\nthe public lands, which amount in the present year to the unexpected\r\nsum of $11,000,000. This circumstance attests the rapidity with which\r\nagriculture, the first and most important occupation of man, advances\r\nand contributes to the wealth and power of our extended territory.\r\nBeing still of the opinion that it is our best policy, as far as we can\r\nconsistently with the obligations under which those lands were ceded to\r\nthe United States, to promote their speedy settlement, I beg leave to\r\ncall the attention of the present Congress to the suggestions I have\r\noffered respecting it in my former messages.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary receipts from the sales of the public lands invite\r\nyou to consider what improvements the land system, and particularly the\r\ncondition of the General Land Office, may require. At the time this\r\ninstitution was organized, near a quarter of a century ago, it would\r\nprobably have been thought extravagant to anticipate for this period\r\nsuch an addition to its business as has been produced by the vast\r\nincrease of those sales during the past and present years. It may also\r\nbe observed that since the year 1812 the land offices and surveying\r\ndistricts have been greatly multiplied, and that numerous legislative\r\nenactments from year to year since that time have imposed a great\r\namount of new and additional duties upon that office, while the want\r\nof a timely application of force commensurate with the care and labor\r\nrequired has caused the increasing embarrassment of accumulated arrears\r\nin the different branches of the establishment.\r\n\r\nThese impediments to the expedition of much duty in the General Land\r\nOffice induce me to submit to your judgment whether some modification\r\nof the laws relating to its organization, or an organization of a new\r\ncharacter, be not called for at the present juncture, to enable the\r\noffice to accomplish all the ends of its institution with a greater\r\ndegree of facility and promptitude than experience has proved to be\r\npracticable under existing regulations. The variety of the concerns and\r\nthe magnitude and complexity of the details occupying and dividing the\r\nattention of the Commissioner appear to render it difficult, if not\r\nimpracticable, for that officer by any possible assiduity to bestow on\r\nall the multifarious subjects upon which he is called to act the ready\r\nand careful attention due to their respective importance, unless the\r\nLegislature shall assist him by a law providing, or enabling him to\r\nprovide, for a more regular and economical distribution of labor, with\r\nthe incident responsibility among those employed under his direction.\r\nThe mere manual operation of affixing his signature to the vast number\r\nof documents issuing from his office subtracts so largely from the time\r\nand attention claimed by the weighty and complicated subjects daily\r\naccumulating in that branch of the public service as to indicate the\r\nstrong necessity of revising the organic law of the establishment. It\r\nwill be easy for Congress hereafter to proportion the expenditure on\r\naccount of this branch of the service to its real wants by abolishing\r\nfrom time to time the offices which can be dispensed with.\r\n\r\nThe extinction of the public debt having taken place, there is no longer\r\nany use for the offices of Commissioners of Loans and of the Sinking\r\nFund. I recommend, therefore, that they be abolished, and that proper\r\nmeasures be taken for the transfer to the Treasury Department of any\r\nfunds, books, and papers connected with the operations of those offices,\r\nand that the proper power be given to that Department for closing\r\nfinally any portion of their business which may remain to be settled.\r\n\r\nIt is also incumbent on Congress in guarding the pecuniary interests\r\nof the country to discontinue by such a law as was passed in 1812 the\r\nreceipt of the bills of the Bank of the United States in payment of the\r\npublic revenue, and to provide for the designation of an agent whose\r\nduty it shall be to take charge of the books and stock of the United\r\nStates in that institution, and to close all connection with it after\r\nthe 3d of March, 1836, when its charter expires. In making provision in\r\nregard to the disposition of this stock it will be essential to define\r\nclearly and strictly the duties and powers of the officer charged with\r\nthat branch of the public service.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the correspondence which the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury will lay before you that notwithstanding the large amount\r\nof the stock which the United States hold in that institution no\r\ninformation has yet been communicated which will enable the Government\r\nto anticipate when it can receive any dividends or derive any benefit\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nConnected with the condition of the finances and the flourishing state\r\nof the country in all its branches of industry, it is pleasing to\r\nwitness the advantages which have been already derived from the recent\r\nlaws regulating the value of the gold coinage. These advantages will be\r\nmore apparent in the course of the next year, when the branch mints\r\nauthorized to be established in North Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana\r\nshall have gone into operation. Aided, as it is hoped they will be, by\r\nfurther reforms in the banking systems of the States and by judicious\r\nregulations on the part of Congress in relation to the custody of the\r\npublic moneys, it may be confidently anticipated that the use of gold\r\nand silver as a circulating medium will become general in the ordinary\r\ntransactions connected with the labor of the country. The great\r\ndesideratum in modern times is an efficient check upon the power of\r\nbanks, preventing that excessive issue of paper whence arise those\r\nfluctuations in the standard of value which render uncertain the rewards\r\nof labor. It was supposed by those who established the Bank of the\r\nUnited States that from the credit given to it by the custody of the\r\npublic moneys and other privileges and the precautions taken to guard\r\nagainst the evils which the country had suffered in the bankruptcy of\r\nmany of the State institutions of that period we should derive from that\r\ninstitution all the security and benefits of a sound currency and every\r\ngood end that was attainable under that provision of the Constitution\r\nwhich authorizes Congress alone to coin money and regulate the value\r\nthereof. But it is scarcely necessary now to say that these\r\nanticipations have not been realized.\r\n\r\nAfter the extensive embarrassment and distress recently produced by the\r\nBank of the United States, from which the country is now recovering,\r\naggravated as they were by pretensions to power which defied the public\r\nauthority, and which if acquiesced in by the people would have changed\r\nthe whole character of our Government, every candid and intelligent\r\nindividual must admit that for the attainment of the great advantages of\r\na sound currency we must look to a course of legislation radically\r\ndifferent from that which created such an institution.\r\n\r\nIn considering the means of obtaining so important an end we must set\r\naside all calculations of temporary convenience, and be influenced\r\nby those only which are in harmony with the true character and the\r\npermanent interests of the Republic. We must recur to first principles\r\nand see what it is that has prevented the legislation of Congress and\r\nthe States on the subject of currency from satisfying the public\r\nexpectation and realizing results corresponding to those which have\r\nattended the action of our system when truly consistent with the great\r\nprinciple of equality upon which it rests, and with that spirit of\r\nforbearance and mutual concession and generous patriotism which was\r\noriginally, and must ever continue to be, the vital element of our\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nOn this subject I am sure that I can not be mistaken in ascribing our\r\nwant of success to the undue countenance which has been afforded to the\r\nspirit of monopoly. All the serious dangers which our system has yet\r\nencountered may be traced to the resort to implied powers and the use of\r\ncorporations clothed with privileges, the effect of which is to advance\r\nthe interests of the few at the expense of the many. We have felt but\r\none class of these dangers exhibited in the contest waged by the Bank\r\nof the United States against the Government for the last four years.\r\nHappily they have been obviated for the present by the indignant\r\nresistance of the people, but we should recollect that the principle\r\nwhence they sprung is an ever-active one, which will not fail to renew\r\nits efforts in the same and in other forms so long as there is a hope\r\nof success, founded either on the inattention of the people or the\r\ntreachery of their representatives to the subtle progress of its\r\ninfluence. The bank is, in fact, but one of the fruits of a system at\r\nwar with the genius of all our institutions--a system founded upon a\r\npolitical creed the fundamental principle of which is a distrust of\r\nthe popular will as a safe regulator of political power, and whose\r\ngreat ultimate object and inevitable result, should it prevail, is the\r\nconsolidation of all power in our system in one central government.\r\nLavish public disbursements and corporations with exclusive privileges\r\nwould be its substitutes for the original and as yet sound checks and\r\nbalances of the Constitution--the means by whose silent and secret\r\noperation a control would be exercised by the few over the political\r\nconduct of the many by first acquiring that control over the labor and\r\nearnings of the great body of the people. Wherever this spirit has\r\neffected an alliance with political power, tyranny and despotism have\r\nbeen the fruit. If it is ever used for the ends of government, it has to\r\nbe incessantly watched, or it corrupts the sources of the public virtue\r\nand agitates the country with questions unfavorable to the harmonious\r\nand steady pursuit of its true interests.\r\n\r\nWe are now to see whether, in the present favorable condition of the\r\ncountry, we can not take an effectual stand against this spirit of\r\nmonopoly, and practically prove in respect to the currency as well as\r\nother important interests that there is no necessity for so extensive a\r\nresort to it as that which has been heretofore practiced. The experience\r\nof another year has confirmed the utter fallacy of the idea that the\r\nBank of the United States was necessary as a fiscal agent of the\r\nGovernment. Without its aid as such, indeed, in despite of all the\r\nembarrassment it was in its power to create, the revenue has been paid\r\nwith punctuality by our citizens, the business of exchange, both\r\nforeign and domestic, has been conducted with convenience, and the\r\ncirculating medium has been greatly improved. By the use of the State\r\nbanks, which do not derive their charters from the General Government\r\nand are not controlled by its authority, it is ascertained that the\r\nmoneys of the United States can be collected and disbursed without loss\r\nor inconvenience, and that all the wants of the community in relation\r\nto exchange and currency are supplied as well as they have ever been\r\nbefore. If under circumstances the most unfavorable to the steadiness of\r\nthe money market it has been found that the considerations on which the\r\nBank of the United States rested its claims to the public favor were\r\nimaginary and groundless, it can not be doubted that the experience of\r\nthe future will be more decisive against them.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that without the agency of a great moneyed monopoly the\r\nrevenue can be collected and conveniently and safely applied to all the\r\npurposes of the public expenditure. It is also ascertained that instead\r\nof being necessarily made to promote the evils of an unchecked paper\r\nsystem, the management of the revenue can be made auxiliary to the\r\nreform which the legislatures of several of the States have already\r\ncommenced in regard to the suppression of small bills, and which has\r\nonly to be fostered by proper regulations on the part of Congress to\r\nsecure a practical return to the extent required for the security of\r\nthe currency to the constitutional medium. Severed from the Government\r\nas political engines, and not susceptible of dangerous extension and\r\ncombination, the State banks will not be tempted, nor will they have the\r\npower, which we have seen exercised, to divert the public funds from the\r\nlegitimate purposes of the Government. The collection and custody of\r\nthe revenue, being, on the contrary, a source of credit to them, will\r\nincrease the security which the States provide for a faithful execution\r\nof their trusts by multiplying the scrutinies to which their operations\r\nand accounts will be subjected. Thus disposed, as well from interest\r\nas the obligations of their charters, it can not be doubted that such\r\nconditions as Congress may see fit to adopt respecting the deposits in\r\nthese institutions, with a view to the gradual disuse, of the small\r\nbills will be cheerfully complied with, and that we shall soon gain in\r\nplace of the Bank of the United States a practical reform in the whole\r\npaper system of the country. If by this policy we can ultimately witness\r\nthe suppression of all bank bills below $20, it is apparent that gold\r\nand silver will take their place and become the principal circulating\r\nmedium in the common business of the farmers and mechanics of the\r\ncountry. The attainment of such a result will form an era in the history\r\nof our country which will be dwelt upon with delight by every true\r\nfriend of its liberty and independence. It will lighten the great\r\ntax which our paper system has so long collected from the earnings of\r\nlabor, and do more to revive and perpetuate those habits of economy and\r\nsimplicity which are so congenial to the character of republicans than\r\nall the legislation which has yet been attempted.\r\n\r\nTo this subject I feel that I can not too earnestly invite the special\r\nattention of Congress, without the exercise of whose authority the\r\nopportunity to accomplish so much public good must pass unimproved.\r\nDeeply impressed with its vital importance, the Executive has taken all\r\nthe steps within his constitutional power to guard the public revenue\r\nand defeat the expectation which the Bank of the United States indulged\r\nof renewing and perpetuating its monopoly on the ground of its necessity\r\nas a fiscal agent and as affording a sounder currency than could be\r\nobtained without such an institution. In the performance of this duty\r\nmuch responsibility was incurred which would have been gladly avoided if\r\nthe stake which the public had in the question could have been otherwise\r\npreserved. Although clothed with the legal authority and supported by\r\nprecedent, I was aware that there was in the act of the removal of the\r\ndeposits a liability to excite that sensitiveness to Executive power\r\nwhich it is the characteristic and the duty of freemen to indulge; but\r\nI relied on this feeling also, directed by patriotism and intelligence,\r\nto vindicate the conduct which in the end would appear to have been\r\ncalled for by the best interests of my country. The apprehensions\r\nnatural to this feeling that there may have been a desire, through the\r\ninstrumentality of that measure, to extend the Executive influence, or\r\nthat it may have been prompted by motives not sufficiently free from\r\nambition, were not overlooked. Under the operation of our institutions\r\nthe public servant who is called on to take a step of high\r\nresponsibility should feel in the freedom which gives rise to such\r\napprehensions his highest security. When unfounded the attention which\r\nthey arouse and the discussions they excite deprive those who indulge\r\nthem of the power to do harm; when just they but hasten the certainty\r\nwith which the great body of our citizens never fail to repel an attempt\r\nto procure their sanction to any exercise of power inconsistent with the\r\njealous maintenance of their rights. Under such convictions, and\r\nentertaining no doubt that my constitutional obligations demanded the\r\nsteps which were taken in reference to the removal of the deposits, it\r\nwas impossible for me to be deterred from the path of duty by a fear\r\nthat my motives could be misjudged or that political prejudices could\r\ndefeat the just consideration of the merits of my conduct. The result\r\nhas shewn how safe is this reliance upon the patriotic temper and\r\nenlightened discernment of the people. That measure has now been before\r\nthem and has stood the test of all the severe analysis which its general\r\nimportance, the interests it affected, and the apprehensions it excited\r\nwere calculated to produce, and it now remains for Congress to consider\r\nwhat legislation has become necessary in consequence.\r\n\r\nI need only add to what I have on former occasions said on this subject\r\ngenerally that in the regulations which Congress may prescribe\r\nrespecting the custody of the public moneys it is desirable that as\r\nlittle discretion as may be deemed consistent with their safe-keeping\r\nshould be given to the executive agents. No one can be more deeply\r\nimpressed than I am with the soundness of the doctrine which restrains\r\nand limits, by specific provisions, executive discretion, as far as it\r\ncan be done consistently with the preservation of its constitutional\r\ncharacter. In respect to the control over the public money this doctrine\r\nis peculiarly applicable, and is in harmony with the great principle\r\nwhich I felt I was sustaining in the controversy with the Bank of the\r\nUnited States, which has resulted in severing to some extent a dangerous\r\nconnection between a moneyed and political power. The duty of the\r\nLegislature to define, by clear and positive enactments, the nature and\r\nextent of the action which it belongs to the Executive to superintend\r\nsprings out of a policy analogous to that which enjoins upon all the\r\nbranches of the Federal Government an abstinence from the exercise of\r\npowers not clearly granted.\r\n\r\nIn such a Government, possessing only limited and specific powers, the\r\nspirit of its general administration can not be wise or just when it\r\nopposes the reference of all doubtful points to the great source of\r\nauthority, the States and the people, whose number and diversified\r\nrelations, securing them against the influences and excitements which\r\nmay mislead their agents, make them the safest depository of power.\r\nIn its application to the Executive, with reference to the legislative\r\nbranch of the Government, the same rule of action should make the\r\nPresident ever anxious to avoid the exercise of any discretionary\r\nauthority which can be regulated by Congress. The biases which may\r\noperate upon him will not be so likely to extend to the representatives\r\nof the people in that body.\r\n\r\nIn my former messages to Congress I have repeatedly urged the\r\npropriety of lessening the discretionary authority lodged in the\r\nvarious Departments, but it has produced no effect as yet, except\r\nthe discontinuance of extra allowances in the Army and Navy and the\r\nsubstitution of fixed salaries in the latter. It is believed that the\r\nsame principles could be advantageously applied in all cases, and would\r\npromote the efficiency and economy of the public service, at the same\r\ntime that greater satisfaction and more equal justice would be secured\r\nto the public officers generally.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of War will put you in\r\npossession of the operations of the Department confided to his care\r\nin all its diversified relations during the past year.\r\n\r\nI am gratified in being able to inform you that no occurrence has\r\nrequired any movement of the military force, except such as is common to\r\na state of peace. The services of the Army have been limited to their\r\nusual duties at the various garrisons upon the Atlantic and inland\r\nfrontier, with the exceptions stated by the Secretary of War. Our small\r\nmilitary establishment appears to be adequate to the purposes for which\r\nit is maintained, and it forms a nucleus around which any additional\r\nforce may be collected should the public exigencies unfortunately\r\nrequire any increase of our military means.\r\n\r\nThe various acts of Congress which have been recently passed in relation\r\nto the Army have improved its condition, and have rendered its\r\norganization more useful and efficient. It is at all times in a state\r\nfor prompt and vigorous action, and it contains within itself the power\r\nof extension to any useful limit, while at the same time it preserves\r\nthat knowledge, both theoretical and practical, which education and\r\nexperience alone can give, and which, if not acquired and preserved in\r\ntime of peace, must be sought under great disadvantages in time of war.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the Engineer Corps press heavily upon that branch of the\r\nservice, and the public interest requires an addition to its strength.\r\nThe nature of the works in which the officers are engaged renders\r\nnecessary professional knowledge and experience, and there is no economy\r\nin committing to them more duties than they can perform or in assigning\r\nthese to other persons temporarily employed, and too often of necessity\r\nwithout all the qualifications which such service demands. I recommend\r\nthis subject to your attention, and also the proposition submitted at\r\nthe last session of Congress and now renewed, for a reorganization of\r\nthe Topographical Corps. This reorganization can be effected without any\r\naddition to the present expenditure and with much advantage to the\r\npublic service. The branch of duties which devolves upon these officers\r\nis at all times interesting to the community, and the information\r\nfurnished by them is useful in peace and war.\r\n\r\nMuch loss and inconvenience have been experienced in consequence of\r\nthe failure of the bill containing the ordinary appropriations for\r\nfortifications which passed one branch of the National Legislature at\r\nthe last session, but was lost in the other. This failure was the more\r\nregretted not only because it necessarily interrupted and delayed the\r\nprogress of a system of national defense, projected immediately after\r\nthe last war and since steadily pursued, but also because it contained\r\na contingent appropriation, inserted in accordance with the views\r\nof the Executive, in aid of this important object and other branches\r\nof the national defense, some portions of which might have been most\r\nusefully applied during the past season. I invite your early attention\r\nto that part of the report of the Secretary of War which relates\r\nto this subject, and recommend an appropriation sufficiently liberal\r\nto accelerate the armament of the fortifications agreeably to the\r\nproposition submitted by him, and to place our whole Atlantic seaboard\r\nin a complete state of defense. A just regard to the permanent interests\r\nof the country evidently requires this measure, but there are also other\r\nreasons which at the present juncture give it peculiar force and make\r\nit my duty to call to the subject your special consideration.\r\n\r\nThe present system of military education has been in operation\r\nsufficiently long to test its usefulness, and it has given to the\r\nArmy a valuable body of officers. It is not alone in the improvement,\r\ndiscipline, and operation of the troops that these officers are\r\nemployed. They are also extensively engaged in the administrative and\r\nfiscal concerns of the various matters confided to the War Department;\r\nin the execution of the staff duties usually appertaining to military\r\norganization; in the removal of the Indians and in the disbursement of\r\nthe various expenditures growing out of our Indian relations; in the\r\nformation of roads and in the improvement of harbors and rivers; in\r\nthe construction of fortifications, in the fabrication of much of the\r\n_matériel_ required for the public defense, and in the preservation,\r\ndistribution, and accountability of the whole, and in other\r\nmiscellaneous duties not admitting of classification.\r\n\r\nThese diversified functions embrace very heavy expenditures of public\r\nmoney, and require fidelity, science, and business habits in their\r\nexecution, and a system which shall secure these qualifications is\r\ndemanded by the public interest. That this object has been in a great\r\nmeasure obtained by the Military Academy is shewn by the state of the\r\nservice and by the prompt accountability which has generally followed\r\nthe necessary advances. Like all other political systems, the present\r\nmode of military education no doubt has its imperfections, both of\r\nprinciple and practice; but I trust these can be improved by rigid\r\ninspections and by legislative scrutiny without destroying the\r\ninstitution itself.\r\n\r\nOccurrences to which we as well as all other nations are liable, both\r\nin our internal and external relations, point to the necessity of an\r\nefficient organization of the militia. I am again induced by the\r\nimportance of the subject to bring it to your attention. To suppress\r\ndomestic violence and to repel foreign invasion, should these calamities\r\novertake us, we must rely in the first instance upon the great body of\r\nthe community whose will has instituted and whose power must support\r\nthe Government. A large standing military force is not consonant to the\r\nspirit of our institutions nor to the feelings of our countrymen, and\r\nthe lessons of former days and those also of our own times shew the\r\ndanger as well as the enormous expense of these permanent and extensive\r\nmilitary organizations. That just medium which avoids an inadequate\r\npreparation on one hand and the danger and expense of a large force on\r\nthe other is what our constituents have a right to expect from their\r\nGovernment. This object can be attained only by the maintenance of\r\na small military force and by such an organization of the physical\r\nstrength of the country as may bring this power into operation whenever\r\nits services are required. A classification of the population offers the\r\nmost obvious means of effecting this organization. Such a division may\r\nbe made as will be just to all by transferring each at a proper period\r\nof life from one class to another and by calling first for the services\r\nof that class, whether for instruction or action, which from age is\r\nqualified for the duty and may be called to perform it with least\r\ninjury to themselves or to the public. Should the danger ever become so\r\nimminent as to require additional force, the other classes in succession\r\nwould be ready for the call. And if in addition to this organization\r\nvoluntary associations were encouraged and inducements held out for\r\ntheir formation, our militia would be in a state of efficient service.\r\nNow, when we are at peace, is the proper time to digest and establish\r\na practicable system. The object is certainly worth the experiment and\r\nworth the expense. No one appreciating the blessings of a republican\r\ngovernment can object to his share of the burden which such a plan may\r\nimpose. Indeed, a moderate portion of the national funds could scarcely\r\nbe better applied than in carrying into effect and continuing such an\r\narrangement, and in giving the necessary elementary instruction. We are\r\nhappily at peace with all the world. A sincere desire to continue so and\r\na fixed determination to give no just cause of offense to other nations\r\nfurnish, unfortunately, no certain grounds of expectation that this\r\nrelation will be uninterrupted. With this determination to give no\r\noffense is associated a resolution, equally decided, tamely to submit\r\nto none. The armor and the attitude of defense afford the best security\r\nagainst those collisions which the ambition, or interest, or some other\r\npassion of nations not more justifiable is liable to produce. In many\r\ncountries it is considered unsafe to put arms into the hands of the\r\npeople and to instruct them in the elements of military knowledge. That\r\nfear can have no place here when it is recollected that the people are\r\nthe sovereign power. Our Government was instituted and is supported by\r\nthe ballot box, not by the musket. Whatever changes await it, still\r\ngreater changes must be made in our social institutions before our\r\npolitical system can yield to physical force. In every aspect,\r\ntherefore, in which I can view the subject I am impressed with the\r\nimportance of a prompt and efficient organization of the militia.\r\n\r\nThe plan of removing the aboriginal people who yet remain within the\r\nsettled portions of the United States to the country west of the\r\nMississippi River approaches its consummation. It was adopted on the\r\nmost mature consideration of the condition of this race, and ought to\r\nbe persisted in till the object is accomplished, and prosecuted with\r\nas much vigor as a just regard to their circumstances will permit, and\r\nas fast as their consent can be obtained. All preceding experiments\r\nfor the improvement of the Indians have failed. It seems now to be an\r\nestablished fact that they can not live in contact with a civilized\r\ncommunity and prosper. Ages of fruitless endeavors have at length\r\nbrought us to a knowledge of this principle of intercommunication with\r\nthem. The past we can not recall, but the future we can provide for.\r\nIndependently of the treaty stipulations into which we have entered with\r\nthe various tribes for the usufructuary rights they have ceded to us,\r\nno one can doubt the moral duty of the Government of the United States\r\nto protect and if possible to preserve and perpetuate the scattered\r\nremnants of this race which are left within our borders. In the\r\ndischarge of this duty an extensive region in the West has been assigned\r\nfor their permanent residence. It has been divided into districts and\r\nallotted among them. Many have already removed and others are preparing\r\nto go, and with the exception of two small bands living in Ohio and\r\nIndiana, not exceeding 1,500 persons, and of the Cherokees, all the\r\ntribes on the east side of the Mississippi, and extending from Lake\r\nMichigan to Florida, have entered into engagements which will lead\r\nto their transplantation.\r\n\r\nThe plan for their removal and reestablishment is founded upon the\r\nknowledge we have gained of their character and habits, and has been\r\ndictated by a spirit of enlarged liberality. A territory exceeding in\r\nextent that relinquished has been granted to each tribe. Of its\r\nclimate, fertility, and capacity to support an Indian population the\r\nrepresentations are highly favorable. To these districts the Indians are\r\nremoved at the expense of the United States, and with certain supplies\r\nof clothing, arms, ammunition, and other indispensable articles; they\r\nare also furnished gratuitously with provisions for the period of a year\r\nafter their arrival at their new homes. In that time, from the nature\r\nof the country and of the products raised by them, they can subsist\r\nthemselves by agricultural labor, if they choose to resort to that mode\r\nof life; if they do not they are upon the skirts of the great prairies,\r\nwhere countless herds of buffalo roam, and a short time suffices to\r\nadapt their own habits to the changes which a change of the animals\r\ndestined for their food may require. Ample arrangements have also been\r\nmade for the support of schools; in some instances council houses and\r\nchurches are to be erected, dwellings constructed for the chiefs, and\r\nmills for common use. Funds have been set apart for the maintenance of\r\nthe poor; the most necessary mechanical arts have been introduced, and\r\nblacksmiths, gunsmiths, wheelwrights, millwrights, etc., are supported\r\namong them. Steel and iron, and sometimes salt, are purchased for them,\r\nand plows and other farming utensils, domestic animals, looms, spinning\r\nwheels, cards, etc., are presented to them. And besides these beneficial\r\narrangements, annuities are in all cases paid, amounting in some\r\ninstances to more than $30 for each individual of the tribe, and in all\r\ncases sufficiently great, if justly divided and prudently expended, to\r\nenable them, in addition to their own exertions, to live comfortably.\r\nAnd as a stimulus for exertion, it is now provided by law that \"in all\r\ncases of the appointment of interpreters or other persons employed for\r\nthe benefit of the Indians a preference shall be given to persons of\r\nIndian descent, if such can be found who are properly qualified for the\r\ndischarge of the duties.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the arrangements for the physical comfort and for the moral\r\nimprovement of the Indians. The necessary measures for their political\r\nadvancement and for their separation from our citizens have not been\r\nneglected. The pledge of the United States has been given by Congress\r\nthat the country destined for the residence of this people shall be\r\nforever \"secured and guaranteed to them.\" A country west of Missouri and\r\nArkansas has been assigned to them, into which the white settlements\r\nare not to be pushed. No political communities can be formed in that\r\nextensive region, except those which are established by the Indians\r\nthemselves or by the United States for them and with their concurrence.\r\nA barrier has thus been raised for their protection against the\r\nencroachment of our citizens, and guarding the Indians as far as\r\npossible from those evils which have brought them to their present\r\ncondition. Summary authority has been given by law to destroy all ardent\r\nspirits found in their country, without waiting the doubtful result\r\nand slow process of a legal seizure. I consider the absolute and\r\nunconditional interdiction of this article among these people as the\r\nfirst and great step in their melioration. Halfway measures will answer\r\nno purpose. These can not successfully contend against the cupidity\r\nof the seller and the overpowering appetite of the buyer. And the\r\ndestructive effects of the traffic are marked in every page of the\r\nhistory of our Indian intercourse.\r\n\r\nSome general legislation seems necessary for the regulation of the\r\nrelations which will exist in this new state of things between the\r\nGovernment and people of the United States and these transplanted\r\nIndian tribes, and for the establishment among the latter, and with\r\ntheir own consent, of some principles of intercommunication which their\r\njuxtaposition will call for; that moral may be substituted for physical\r\nforce, the authority of a few and simple laws for the tomahawk, and that\r\nan end may be put to those bloody wars whose prosecution seems to have\r\nmade part of their social system.\r\n\r\nAfter the further details of this arrangement are completed, with a very\r\ngeneral supervision over them, they ought to be left to the progress of\r\nevents. These, I indulge the hope, will secure their prosperity and\r\nimprovement, and a large portion of the moral debt we owe them will\r\nthen be paid.\r\n\r\nThe report from the Secretary of the Navy, shewing the condition of that\r\nbranch of the public service, is recommended to your special attention.\r\nIt appears from it that our naval force at present in commission,\r\nwith all the activity which can be given to it, is inadequate to the\r\nprotection of our rapidly increasing commerce. This consideration and\r\nthe more general one which regards this arm of the national defense\r\nas our best security against foreign aggressions strongly urge the\r\ncontinuance of the measures which promote its gradual enlargement and a\r\nspeedy increase of the force which has been heretofore employed abroad\r\nand at home. You will perceive from the estimates which appear in the\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Navy that the expenditures necessary to\r\nthis increase of its force, though of considerable amount, are small\r\ncompared with the benefits which they will secure to the country.\r\n\r\nAs a means of strengthening this national arm I also recommend to your\r\nparticular attention the propriety of the suggestion which attracted the\r\nconsideration of Congress at its last session, respecting the enlistment\r\nof boys at a suitable age in the service. In this manner a nursery of\r\nskillful and able-bodied seamen can be established, which will be of\r\nthe greatest importance. Next to the capacity to put afloat and arm the\r\nrequisite number of ships is the possession of the means to man them\r\nefficiently, and nothing seems better calculated to aid this object than\r\nthe measure proposed. As an auxiliary to the advantages derived from our\r\nextensive commercial marine, it would furnish us with a resource ample\r\nenough for all the exigencies which can be anticipated. Considering the\r\nstate of our resources, it can not be doubted that whatever provision\r\nthe liberality and wisdom of Congress may now adopt with a view to the\r\nperfect organization of this branch of our service will meet the\r\napprobation of all classes of our citizens.\r\n\r\nBy the report of the Postmaster-General it appears that the revenue\r\nof the Department during the year ending on the 30th day of June last\r\nexceeded its accruing responsibilities $236,206, and that the surplus\r\nof the present fiscal year is estimated at $476,227. It further appears\r\nthat the debt of the Department on the 1st day of July last, including\r\nthe amount due to contractors for the quarter then just expired, was\r\nabout $1,064,381, exceeding the available means about $23,700; and that\r\non the 1st instant about $597,077 of this debt had been paid--$409,991\r\nout of postages accruing before July and $187,086 out of postages\r\naccruing since. In these payments are included $67,000 of the old debt\r\ndue to banks. After making these payments the Department had $73,000\r\nin bank on the 1st instant. The pleasing assurance is given that the\r\nDepartment is entirely free from embarrassment, and that by collection\r\nof outstanding balances and using the current surplus the remaining\r\nportion of the bank debt and most of the other debt will probably be\r\npaid in April next, leaving thereafter a heavy amount to be applied in\r\nextending the mail facilities of the country. Reserving a considerable\r\nsum for the improvement of existing mail routes, it is stated that the\r\nDepartment will be able to sustain with perfect convenience an annual\r\ncharge of $300,000 for the support of new routes, to commence as soon\r\nas they can be established and put in operation.\r\n\r\nThe measures adopted by the Postmaster-General to bring the means of\r\nthe Department into action and to effect a speedy extinguishment of its\r\ndebt, as well as to produce an efficient administration of its affairs,\r\nwill be found detailed at length in his able and luminous report. Aided\r\nby a reorganization on the principles suggested and such salutary\r\nprovisions in the laws regulating its administrative duties as the\r\nwisdom of Congress may devise or approve, that important Department will\r\nsoon attain a degree of usefulness proportioned to the increase of our\r\npopulation and the extension of our settlements.\r\n\r\nParticular attention is solicited to that portion of the report of the\r\nPostmaster-General which relates to the carriage of the mails of the\r\nUnited States upon railroads constructed by private corporations under\r\nthe authority of the several States. The reliance which the General\r\nGovernment can place on those roads as a means of carrying on its\r\noperations and the principles on which the use of them is to be obtained\r\ncan not too soon be considered and settled. Already does the spirit of\r\nmonopoly begin to exhibit its natural propensities in attempts to exact\r\nfrom the public, for services which it supposes can not be obtained on\r\nother terms, the most extravagant compensation. If these claims be\r\npersisted in, the question may arise whether a combination of citizens,\r\nacting under charters of incorporation from the States, can, by a direct\r\nrefusal or the demand of an exorbitant price, exclude the United States\r\nfrom the use of the established channels of communication between the\r\ndifferent sections of the country, and whether the United States can\r\nnot, without transcending their constitutional powers, secure to the\r\nPost-Office Department the use of those roads by an act of Congress\r\nwhich shall provide within itself some equitable mode of adjusting the\r\namount of compensation. To obviate, if possible, the necessity of\r\nconsidering this question, it is suggested whether it be not expedient\r\nto fix by law the amounts which shall be offered to railroad companies\r\nfor the conveyance of the mails, graduated according to their average\r\nweight, to be ascertained and declared by the Postmaster-General. It\r\nis probable that a liberal proposition of that sort would be accepted.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these provisions in relation to the Post-Office\r\nDepartment, I must also invite your attention to the painful excitement\r\nproduced in the South by attempts to circulate through the mails\r\ninflammatory appeals addressed to the passions of the slaves, in prints\r\nand in various sorts of publications, calculated to stimulate them to\r\ninsurrection and to produce all the horrors of a servile war. There is\r\ndoubtless no respectable portion of our countrymen who can be so far\r\nmisled as to feel any other sentiment than that of indignant regret at\r\nconduct so destructive of the harmony and peace of the country, and so\r\nrepugnant to the principles of our national compact and to the dictates\r\nof humanity and religion. Our happiness and prosperity essentially\r\ndepend upon peace within our borders, and peace depends upon the\r\nmaintenance in good faith of those compromises of the Constitution upon\r\nwhich the Union is founded. It is fortunate for the country that the\r\ngood sense, the generous feeling, and the deep-rooted attachment of\r\nthe people of the nonslaveholding States to the Union and to their\r\nfellow-citizens of the same blood in the South have given so strong\r\nand impressive a tone to the sentiments entertained against the\r\nproceedings of the misguided persons who have engaged in these\r\nunconstitutional and wicked attempts, and especially against the\r\nemissaries from foreign parts who have dared to interfere in this\r\nmatter, as to authorize the hope that those attempts will no longer\r\nbe persisted in. But if these expressions of the public will shall\r\nnot be sufficient to effect so desirable a result, not a doubt can be\r\nentertained that the nonslaveholding States, so far from countenancing\r\nthe slightest interference with the constitutional rights of the South,\r\nwill be prompt to exercise their authority in suppressing so far as in\r\nthem lies whatever is calculated to produce this evil.\r\n\r\nIn leaving the care of other branches of this interesting subject\r\nto the State authorities, to whom they properly belong, it is\r\nnevertheless proper for Congress to take such measures as will prevent\r\nthe Post-Office Department, which was designed to foster an amicable\r\nintercourse and correspondence between all the members of the\r\nConfederacy, from being used as an instrument of an opposite character.\r\nThe General Government, to which the great trust is confided of\r\npreserving inviolate the relations created among the States by the\r\nConstitution, is especially bound to avoid in its own action anything\r\nthat may disturb them. I would therefore call the special attention of\r\nCongress to the subject, and respectfully suggest the propriety of\r\npassing such a law as will prohibit, under severe penalties, the\r\ncirculation in the Southern States, through the mail, of incendiary\r\npublications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection.\r\n\r\nI felt it to be my duty in the first message which I communicated to\r\nCongress to urge upon its attention the propriety of amending that part\r\nof the Constitution which provides for the election of the President and\r\nthe Vice-President of the United States. The leading object which I had\r\nin view was the adoption of some new provisions which would secure to\r\nthe people the performance of this high duty without any intermediate\r\nagency. In my annual communications since I have enforced the same\r\nviews, from a sincere conviction that the best interests of the country\r\nwould be promoted by their adoption. If the subject were an ordinary\r\none, I should have regarded the failure of Congress to act upon it as an\r\nindication of their judgment that the disadvantages which belong to the\r\npresent system were not so great as those which would result from any\r\nattainable substitute that had been submitted to their consideration.\r\nRecollecting, however, that propositions to introduce a new feature in\r\nour fundamental laws can not be too patiently examined, and ought not to\r\nbe received with favor until the great body of the people are thoroughly\r\nimpressed with their necessity and value as a remedy for real evils,\r\nI feel that in renewing the recommendation I have heretofore made on\r\nthis subject I am not transcending the bounds of a just deference to\r\nthe sense of Congress or to the disposition of the people. However much\r\nwe may differ in the choice of the measures which should guide the\r\nadministration of the Government, there can be but little doubt in the\r\nminds of those who are really friendly to the republican features of\r\nour system that one of its most important securities consists in the\r\nseparation of the legislative and executive powers at the same time that\r\neach is held responsible to the great source of authority, which is\r\nacknowledged to be supreme, in the will of the people constitutionally\r\nexpressed. My reflection and experience satisfy me that the framers of\r\nthe Constitution, although they were anxious to mark this feature as a\r\nsettled and fixed principle in the structure of the Government, did not\r\nadopt all the precautions that were necessary to secure its practical\r\nobservance, and that we can not be said to have carried into complete\r\neffect their intentions until the evils which arise from this organic\r\ndefect are remedied.\r\n\r\nConsidering the great extent of our Confederacy, the rapid increase of\r\nits population, and the diversity of their interests and pursuits, it\r\ncan not be disguised that the contingency by which one branch of the\r\nLegislature is to form itself into an electoral college can not become\r\none of ordinary occurrence without producing incalculable mischief. What\r\nwas intended as the medicine of the Constitution in extreme cases can\r\nnot be frequently used without changing its character and sooner or\r\nlater producing incurable disorder.\r\n\r\nEvery election by the House of Representatives is calculated to\r\nlessen the force of that security which is derived from the distinct and\r\nseparate character of the legislative and executive functions, and while\r\nit exposes each to temptations adverse to their efficiency as organs\r\nof the Constitution and laws, its tendency will be to unite both in\r\nresisting the will of the people, and thus give a direction to the\r\nGovernment antirepublican and dangerous. All history tells us that\r\na free people should be watchful of delegated power, and should never\r\nacquiesce in a practice which will diminish their control over it.\r\nThis obligation, so universal in its application to all the principles\r\nof a republic, is peculiarly so in ours, where the formation of parties\r\nfounded on sectional interests is so much fostered by the extent of\r\nour territory. These interests, represented by candidates for the\r\nPresidency, are constantly prone, in the zeal of party and selfish\r\nobjects, to generate influences unmindful of the general good and\r\nforgetful of the restraints which the great body of the people would\r\nenforce if they were in no contingency to lose the right of expressing\r\ntheir will. The experience of our country from the formation of the\r\nGovernment to the present day demonstrates that the people can not too\r\nsoon adopt some stronger safeguard for their right to elect the highest\r\nofficers known to the Constitution than is contained in that sacred\r\ninstrument as it now stands.\r\n\r\nIt is my duty to call the particular attention of Congress to the\r\npresent condition of the District of Columbia. From whatever cause the\r\ngreat depression has arisen which now exists in the pecuniary concerns\r\nof this District, it is proper that its situation should be fully\r\nunderstood and such relief or remedies provided as are consistent with\r\nthe powers of Congress. I earnestly recommend the extension of every\r\npolitical right to the citizens of this District which their true\r\ninterests require, and which does not conflict with the provisions of\r\nthe Constitution. It is believed that the laws for the government of the\r\nDistrict require revisal and amendment, and that much good may be done\r\nby modifying the penal code so as to give uniformity to its provisions.\r\n\r\nYour attention is also invited to the defects which exist in the\r\njudicial system of the United States. As at present organized the States\r\nof the Union derive unequal advantages from the Federal judiciary, which\r\nhave been so often pointed out that I deem it unnecessary to repeat them\r\nhere. It is hoped that the present Congress will extend to all the\r\nStates that equality in respect to the benefits of the laws of the Union\r\nwhich can only be secured by the uniformity and efficiency of the\r\njudicial system.\r\n\r\nWith these observations on the topics of general interest which are\r\ndeemed worthy of your consideration, I leave them to your care, trusting\r\nthat the legislative measures they call for will be met as the wants and\r\nthe best interests of our beloved country demand.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: For communication, see pp. 202-208.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Livingston to the Duke de Broglie_.\r\n\r\nLEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 25, 1835_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the Duc de Broglie, etc.,\r\n\r\n_Minister Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs_.\r\n\r\nSIR: About to return to my own country, I am unwilling to leave this\r\nwithout adding one more effort to the many I have heretofore made to\r\nrestore to both that mutual good understanding which their best\r\ninterests require, and which probable events may interrupt and perhaps\r\npermanently destroy.\r\n\r\nFrom the correspondence and acts of His Majesty's Government since the\r\nmessage of the President of the United States was known at Paris it is\r\nevident that an idea is entertained of making the fulfillment of the\r\ntreaty of 1831 dependent on explanations to be given of the terms used\r\nin the message, and withholding payment of an acknowledged debt until\r\nsatisfaction be given for a supposed indecorum in demanding it. The bare\r\npossibility that this opinion might be entertained and acted upon by His\r\nMajesty's Government renders it incumbent on me to state explicitly what\r\nI understand to be the sentiments of mine on this subject.\r\n\r\nErroneous impressions, arising from the want of a proper attention to\r\nthe structure of our Government, to the duties of its Chief Magistrate,\r\nto the principles it has adopted and its strict adherence to them in\r\nsimilar cases, might raise expectations which could never be realized\r\nand lead to measures destructive of all harmony between the parties.\r\nThis communication is made in full confidence that it is the wish of His\r\nMajesty's Government, as it most sincerely is that of the President, to\r\navoid all measures of that description; and it is hoped, therefore, that\r\nit will be received in the spirit by which it is dictated--that of\r\nconciliation and peace.\r\n\r\nThe form of our Government and the functions of the President as\r\na component part of it have in their relation to this subject been\r\nsufficiently explained in my previous correspondence, especially in\r\nmy letter to the Comte de Rigny of the 29th of January last. I have\r\ntherefore little to add to that part of my representation which is\r\ndrawn from the form of our Government and the duties of the President\r\nin administering it. If these are fully understood, the principles of\r\naction derived from them can not be mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe President, as the chief executive power, must have a free and\r\nentirely unfettered communication with the coordinate powers of\r\nGovernment. As the organ of intercourse with other nations, he is\r\nthe only source from which a knowledge of our relations with them\r\ncan be conveyed to the legislative branches. It results from this\r\nthat the utmost freedom from all restraint in the details into which\r\nhe is obliged to enter of international concerns and of the measures\r\nin relation to them is essential to the proper performance of this\r\nimportant part of his functions. He must exercise them without having\r\ncontinually before him the fear of offending the susceptibility of the\r\npowers whose conduct he is obliged to notice. In the performance of this\r\nduty he is subject to public opinion and his own sense of propriety\r\nfor an indiscreet, to his constituents for a dangerous, and to his\r\nconstitutional judges for an illegal, exercise of the power, but to no\r\nother censure, foreign or domestic. Were any foreign powers permitted to\r\nscan the communications of the Executive, their complaints, whether real\r\nor affected, would involve the country in continual controversies; for\r\nthe right being acknowledged, it would be a duty to exercise it by\r\ndemanding a disavowal of every phrase they might deem offensive and an\r\nexplanation of every word to which an improper interpretation could be\r\ngiven. The principle, therefore, has been adopted that no foreign power\r\nhas a right to ask for explanations of anything that the President,\r\nin the exercise of his functions, thinks proper to communicate to\r\nCongress, or of any course he may advise them to pursue. This rule is\r\nnot applicable to the Government of the United States alone, but, in\r\ncommon with it, to all those in which the constitutional powers are\r\ndistributed into different branches. No such nation desirous of avoiding\r\nforeign influence or foreign interference in its councils; no such\r\nnation possessing a due sense of its dignity and independence, can long\r\nsubmit to the consequences of this interference. When these are felt, as\r\nthey soon will be, all must unite in repelling it, and acknowledge that\r\nthe United States are contending in a cause common to them all, and more\r\nimportant to the liberal Governments of Europe than even to themselves;\r\nfor it is too obvious to escape the slightest attention that the\r\nMonarchies of Europe by which they are surrounded will have all the\r\nadvantage of this supervision of the domestic councils of their\r\nneighbors without being subject to it themselves. It is true that in\r\nthe representative Governments of Europe executive communications to\r\nlegislative bodies have not the extension that is given to them in the\r\nUnited States, and that they are therefore less liable to attack on that\r\nquarter; but they must not imagine themselves safe. In the opening\r\naddress, guarded as it commonly is, every proposition made by the\r\nministry, every resolution of either chamber, will offer occasions for\r\nthe jealous interference of national punctilio, for all occupy the same\r\ngrounds. No intercommunication of the different branches of Government\r\nwill be safe, and even the courts of justice will afford no sanctuary\r\nfor freedom of decision and of debate, and the susceptibility of foreign\r\npowers must be consulted in all the departments of Government. Occasions\r\nfor intervention in the affairs of other countries are but too numerous\r\nat present, without opening another door to encroachments; and it is no\r\nanswer to the argument to say that no complaints will be made but for\r\nreasonable cause, and that of this, the nation complained of being the\r\njudge, no evil can ensue. But this argument concedes the right of\r\nexamining the communications in question, which is denied. Allow it and\r\nyou will have frivolous as well as grave complaints to answer, and must\r\nnot only heal the wounds of a just national pride, but apply a remedy\r\nto those of a morbid susceptibility. To show that my fear of the\r\nprogressive nature of these encroachments is not imaginary, I pray leave\r\nto call your excellency's attention to the inclosed report from the\r\nSecretary of State to the President. It is offered for illustration, not\r\nfor complaint; I am instructed to make none. Because the Government of\r\nFrance has taken exceptions to the President's opening message, the\r\nchargé d'affaires of France thinks it his duty to protest against a\r\nspecial communication, and to point out the particular passages in a\r\ncorrespondence of an American minister with his own Government to the\r\npublication of which he objects. If the principle I contest is just,\r\nthe chargé d'affaires is right. He has done his duty as a vigilant\r\nsupervisor of the President's correspondence. If the principle is\r\nadmitted, every diplomatic agent at Washington will do the same, and we\r\nshall have twenty censors of the correspondence of the Government and of\r\nthe public press. If the principle is correct, every communication which\r\nthe President makes in relation to our foreign affairs, either to the\r\nCongress or to the public, ought in prudence to be previously submitted\r\nto these ministers, in order to avoid disputes and troublesome and\r\nhumiliating explanations. If the principle be submitted to, neither\r\ndignity nor independence is left to the nation. To submit even to\r\na discreet exercise of such a privilege would be troublesome and\r\ndegrading, and the inevitable abuse of it could not be borne. It must\r\ntherefore be resisted at the threshold, and its entrance forbidden\r\ninto the sanctuary of domestic consultations. But whatever may be the\r\nprinciples of other governments, those of the United States are fixed;\r\nthe right will never be acknowledged, and any attempt to enforce it\r\nwill be repelled by the undivided energy of the nation.\r\n\r\nI pray your excellency to observe that my argument does not deny a right\r\nto all foreign powers of taking proper exceptions to the governmental\r\nacts and language of another. It is to their interference in its\r\nconsultations, in its proceedings while yet in an inchoate state, that\r\nwe object. Should the President do an official executive act affecting\r\na foreign power, or use exceptionable language in addressing it through\r\nhis minister or through theirs; should a law be passed injurious to the\r\ndignity of another nation--in all these and other similar cases a demand\r\nfor explanation would be respectfully received, and answered in the\r\nmanner that justice and a regard to the dignity of the complaining\r\nnation would require.\r\n\r\nAfter stating these principles, let me add that they have not only been\r\ntheoretically adopted, but that they have been practically asserted.\r\nOn two former occasions exceptions of the same nature were taken to the\r\nPresident's message by the Government of France, and in neither did\r\nthey produce any other explanation than that derived from the nature\r\nof our Government, and this seems on those occasions to have been\r\ndeemed sufficient, for in both cases the objections were virtually\r\nabandoned--one when Messrs. Marshall, Gerry, and Pinckney were refused\r\nto be received, and again in the negotiation between Prince Polignac and\r\nMr. Rives. In the former case, although the message of the President\r\nwas alleged as the cause of the refusal to receive the ministers, yet\r\nwithout any such explanation their successors were honorably accredited.\r\nIn the latter case the allusion in the message to an apprehended\r\ncollision was excepted to, but the reference made by Mr. Rives to\r\nthe constitutional duties of the President seems to have removed the\r\nobjection.\r\n\r\nHaving demonstrated that the United States can not in any case permit\r\ntheir Chief Magistrate to be questioned by any foreign government in\r\nrelation to his communications with the coordinate branches of his own,\r\nit is scarcely necessary to consider the case of such an explanation\r\nbeing required as the condition on which the fulfillment of a treaty or\r\nany pecuniary advantage was to depend. The terms of such a proposition\r\nneed only be stated to show that it would be not only inadmissible, but\r\nrejected as offensive to the nation to which it might be addressed.\r\nIn this case it would be unnecessary as well as inadmissible. France\r\nhas already received, by the voluntary act of the President, every\r\nexplanation the nicest sense of national honor could desire. That which\r\ncould not have been given to a demand, that which can never be given\r\non the condition now under discussion, a fortunate succession of\r\ncircumstances, as I shall proceed to shew, has brought about. Earnestly\r\ndesirous of restoring the good understanding between the two nations,\r\nas soon as a dissatisfaction with the President's message was shewn\r\nI suppressed every feeling which the mode of expressing that\r\ndissatisfaction was calculated to produce, and without waiting for\r\ninstructions I hastened on my own responsibility to make a communication\r\nto your predecessor in office on the subject. In this, under the reserve\r\nthat the President could not be called on for an explanation, I did\r\nin fact give one that I thought would have removed all injurious\r\nimpressions.\r\n\r\nThis is the first of the fortunate circumstances to which I have\r\nalluded--fortunate in being made before any demand implying a right to\r\nrequire it; fortunate in its containing, without any knowledge of the\r\nprecise parts of the message which gave offense, answers to all that\r\nhave since come to my knowledge. I can easily conceive that the\r\ncommunication of which I speak, made, as I expressly stated, without\r\nprevious authority from my Government, might not have had the effect\r\nwhich its matter was intended to produce, but it has since (as I have\r\nnow the honor to inform your excellency) received from the President his\r\nfull and unqualified approbation; but it is necessary to add that this\r\nwas given before he had any intimation of an intention to attach it\r\nas a condition to the payment of the indemnity due by the treaty, given\r\nnot only when he was ignorant of any such intent, but when he was\r\ninformed by France that she intended to execute the treaty and saw by\r\nthe law which was introduced that it was not to be fettered by any such\r\ncondition. Thus that is already done by a voluntary act which could not\r\nhave been done when required as a right, still less when made, what will\r\nunquestionably in the United States be considered degrading, as a\r\ncondition. At this time, sir, I would for no consideration enter into\r\nthe details I then did. If I could now so far forget what under present\r\ncircumstances would be due to the dignity of my country, I should be\r\ndisavowed, and deservedly disavowed, by the President. It is happy,\r\ntherefore, I repeat, that the good feeling of my country was evinced in\r\nthe manner I have stated at the only time when it could be done with\r\nhonor; and though present circumstances would forbid my making the\r\ncommunication I then did, they do not prevent my referring to it for\r\nthe purpose of shewing that it contains, as I have stated it does,\r\neverything that ought to have been satisfactory. Actual circumstances\r\nenable me to do this now. Future events, which I need not explain, may\r\nhereafter render it improper, and it may be nugatory unless accepted as\r\nsatisfactory before the occurrence of those events. Let it be examined\r\nwith the care which the importance of giving it a true construction\r\nrequires. The objections to the message, as far as I can understand,\r\nfor they have never been specified, are:\r\n\r\nFirst. That it impeaches the good faith of His Majesty's Government.\r\n\r\nSecondly. That it contains a menace of enforcing the performance of the\r\ntreaty by reprisals.\r\n\r\nOn the first head, were I now discussing the terms of the message\r\nitself, it would be easy to shew that it contains no such charge.\r\nThe allegation that the stipulations of a treaty have not been complied\r\nwith, that engagements made by ministers have not been fulfilled,\r\ncouched in respectful terms, can never be deemed offensive, even when\r\nexpressly directed to the party whose infractions are complained of, and\r\nconsequently can never give cause for a demand of explanation; otherwise\r\nit is evident that no consideration of national injuries could ever take\r\nplace. The message, critically examined on this point, contains nothing\r\nmore than such an enumeration of the causes of complaint. As to its\r\nterms, the most fastidious disposition can not fasten on one that could\r\nbe excepted to. The first refusal and subsequent delay are complained\r\nof, but no unworthy motives for either are charged or insinuated. On the\r\nwhole, if I were commissioned to explain and defend this part of the\r\nmessage, I should say with the conviction of truth that it is impossible\r\nto urge a complaint in milder or more temperate terms; but I am not\r\nso commissioned. I am endeavoring to shew not only that every proper\r\nexplanation is given in my letter to M. de Rigny of the 29th of January\r\nlast, but that in express terms it declares that the sincerity of His\r\nMajesty's Government in their desire to execute the treaty was not\r\ndoubted. Suffer me to draw your excellency's attention to the passages\r\nalluded to. In discussing the nature of M. Sérurier's engagement I say:\r\n\r\n\"It is clear, therefore, that more was required than the expression of\r\na desire on the part of His Majesty's ministers to execute the treaty,\r\n_a desire the sincerity of which was never doubted, but which might be\r\nunavailing, as its accomplishment depended on the vote of the\r\nChambers_.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in speaking of the delay which occurred in the month of December,\r\nI say:\r\n\r\n\"It is referred to, I presume, in order to shew that it was produced by\r\na desire on the part of His Majesty's ministers the better to assure the\r\npassage of the law. Of this, sir, I never had a doubt, and immediately\r\nso advised my Government, and informed it, as was the fact, that I\r\nperfectly acquiesced in the delay.\"\r\n\r\nThus it must be evident, not only that no offensive charge of ill faith\r\nis made in the message, but that, as is expressly stated in the first\r\nextract, full justice was done at Washington to the intentions of the\r\nFrench Government. While the delay is complained of us a wrong, no\r\nimproper motives are attributed to the Government in causing it. Again,\r\nsir, the whole tenor of that part of my letter which relates to the\r\ninexecution of the promise made by M. Sérurier, while it asserts the\r\nconstruction put upon it by the President to be the true one, and\r\nappeals to facts and circumstances to support that construction, yet it\r\navoids charging the French Government with any intentional violation, by\r\nattributing their delay to an erroneous construction only; for in the\r\nletter (I again quote literally) I say:\r\n\r\n\"I have entered into this detail with the object of showing that\r\nalthough the ministers of the King, under the interpretation they seem\r\nto have given to M. Sérurier's promise, may have considered themselves\r\nat liberty to defer the presentation of the law until the period\r\nwhich they thought would best secure its success, yet the President,\r\ninterpreting that promise differently, feeling that in consequence of it\r\nhe had forborne to do what might be strictly called a duty, and seeing\r\nthat its performance had not taken place, could not avoid stating the\r\nwhole case clearly and distinctly to Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThus, sir, the President, in stating the acts of which he thought his\r\ncountry had reason to complain, does not make a single imputation of\r\nimproper motive, and to avoid all misconstruction he offers a voluntary\r\ndeclaration that none such were entertained.\r\n\r\nThe part of the message which seems to have caused the greatest\r\nsensation in France is that in which, after a statement of the causes\r\nof complaint, it enters into a consideration of the measures to obtain\r\nredress which in similar cases are sanctioned by the laws of nations.\r\nThe complaint seems to be that, in a discussion it was impossible to\r\navoid, of the efficacy and convenience of each, a preference was given\r\nto reprisals, considered as a remedial, not as a hostile, measure,\r\nand this has been construed into a menace. If any explanations were\r\nnecessary on this head, they are given in the message itself. It is\r\nthere expressly disavowed, and the power and high character of France\r\nare appealed to to shew that it never could be induced by threats to do\r\nwhat its sense of justice denied. If the measure to which I have more\r\nthan once alluded should be resorted to, and the humiliation attending\r\na compliance with it could be endured; if it were possible under such\r\ncircumstances to give an explanation, what more could be required than\r\nthat which is contained in the message itself that it was not intended\r\nas a menace? If the measure to which I alluded should be adopted and\r\nsubmitted to, what would His Majesty's Government require? The disavowal\r\nof any intent to influence the councils of France by threats? They have\r\nit already. It forms a part of the very instrument which caused the\r\noffense, and I will not do them the injustice to think that they could\r\nform the offensive idea of requiring more. The necessity of discussing\r\nthe nature of the remedies for the nonexecution of the treaty, the\r\ncharacter and spirit in which it was done, are explained in my letter so\r\noften referred to, and I pray your excellency to consider the concluding\r\npart of it, beginning with the quotation I have last made. But if I\r\nwanted any argument to shew that no explanation of this part of the\r\nmessage was necessary or could be required, I should find it in the\r\nopinion--certainly a just one--expressed by His Majesty's ministers,\r\nthat the recommendation of the President not having been adopted by the\r\nother branches of the Government it was not a national act, and could\r\nnot be complained of as such. Nay, in the note presented by M. Sérurier\r\nto the Government at Washington and the measures which it announces (his\r\nrecall and the offer of my passports) the Government of His Majesty seem\r\nto have done all that they thought its dignity required, for they at\r\nthe same time declare that the law providing for the payment will be\r\npresented, but give no intimation of any previous condition and annex\r\nnone to the bill which they present. The account of dignity being thus\r\ndeclared by this demonstration to be settled, it can not be supposed\r\nthat it will again be introduced as a set-off against an acknowledged\r\npecuniary balance. Before I conclude my observations on this part of the\r\nsubject it will be well to inquire in what light exceptions are taken\r\nto this part of the message, whether as a menace generally or to the\r\nparticular measure proposed. In the first view, if every measure that\r\na Government having claims on another declares it must pursue if those\r\nclaims are not allowed (whatever may be the terms employed) is a menace,\r\nit is necessary, and not objectionable unless couched in offensive\r\nlanguage; it is a fair declaration of what course the party making it\r\nintends to pursue, and except in cases where pretexts were wanted for\r\na rupture have rarely been objected to, even when avowedly the act of\r\nthe nation, not, as in this case, a proposal made by one branch of its\r\nGovernment to another. Instances of this are not wanting, but need not\r\nbe here enumerated. One, however, ought to be mentioned, because it is\r\nintimately connected with the subject now under discussion. While the\r\ncommerce of the United States was suffering under the aggressions of the\r\ntwo most powerful nations of the world the American Government, in this\r\nsense of the word, menaced them both. It passed a law in express terms\r\ndeclaring to them that unless they ceased their aggressions America\r\nwould hold no intercourse with them; that their ships would be seized if\r\nthey ventured into American ports; that the productions of their soil or\r\nindustry should be forfeited. Here was an undisguised menace in clear,\r\nunequivocal terms, and of course, according to the argument against\r\nwhich I contend, neither France nor England could deliberate under its\r\npressure without dishonor. Yet the Emperor of France, certainly an\r\nunexceptionable judge of what the dignity of his country required, did\r\ndeliberate, did accept the condition, did repeal the Berlin and Milan\r\ndecrees, did not make any complaint of the act as a threat, though he\r\ncalled it an injury. Great Britain, too, although at that time on not\r\nvery friendly terms with the United States, made no complaint that her\r\npride was offended. Her minister on the spot even made a declaration\r\nthat the obnoxious orders were repealed. It is true he was disavowed,\r\nbut the disavowal was accompanied by no objections to the law as a\r\nthreat. Should the objection be to the nature of the remedy proposed,\r\nand that the recommendation of reprisals is the offensive part, it would\r\nbe easy to show that it stands on the same ground with any other remedy;\r\nthat it is not hostile in its nature; that it has been resorted to by\r\nFrance to procure redress from other powers, and by them against her,\r\nwithout producing war. But such an argument is not necessary. This is\r\nnot the case of a national measure, either of menace or action; it is a\r\nrecommendation only of one branch of Government to another, and France\r\nhas itself shown that a proposal of this nature could not be noticed as\r\nan offense. In the year 1808 the Senate of the United States annexed to\r\nthe bill of nonintercourse a section which not only advised but actually\r\nauthorized the President to issue letters of marque and reprisal against\r\nboth France and England, if the one did not repeal the Berlin and Milan\r\ndecrees and the other did not revoke the orders in council. This clause\r\nwas not acceded to by the Representatives, but it was complete as the\r\nact of the Senate; yet neither France nor England complained of it as\r\nan indignity. Both powers had ministers on the spot, and the dignity of\r\nneither seems to have been offended.\r\n\r\nIf the view I have now taken of the subject be correct; if I have\r\nsucceeded in conveying to His Majesty's ministers the conviction\r\nI myself feel that no right exists in any foreign nation to ask\r\nexplanations of or even to notice any communications between the\r\ndifferent branches of our Government; that to admit it even in a single\r\ninstance would be a dangerous precedent and a derogation from national\r\ndignity, and that in the present instance an explanation that ought to\r\nbe satisfactory has been voluntarily given, I have then demonstrated\r\nthat any measure founded on such supposed right is not only\r\ninadmissible, but is totally unnecessary, and consequently that His\r\nMajesty's ministers may at once declare that previous explanations given\r\nby the minister of the United States, and subsequently approved by the\r\nPresident, had satisfied them on the subject of the message.\r\n\r\nThe motives of my Government during the whole course of this\r\ncontroversy have been misunderstood or not properly appreciated, and the\r\nquestion is daily changing its character. A negotiation entered into for\r\nprocuring compensation to individuals involved no positive obligation\r\non their Governments to prosecute it to extremities. A solemn treaty,\r\nratified by the constitutional organs of the two powers, changed the\r\nprivate into a public right. The Government acquires by it a perfect\r\nright to insist on its stipulations. All doubts as to their justice seem\r\nnow to have been removed, and every objection to the payment of a debt\r\nacknowledged to be just will be severely scrutinized by the impartial\r\nworld. What character will be given to a refusal to pay such a debt on\r\nthe allegation, whether well or ill founded, of an offense to national\r\nhonor it does not become me to say. The French nation are the last that\r\nwould ever appreciate national honor by any number of millions it could\r\nwithhold as a compensation for an injury offered to it. The United\r\nStates, commercial as they are, are the last that would settle such an\r\naccount. The proposition I allude to would be unworthy of both, and it\r\nis sincerely to be hoped that it will never be made.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the possibility of misapprehension, I repeat that this\r\ncommunication is made with the single view of apprising His Majesty's\r\nGovernment of the consequences attending a measure which without such\r\nnotice they might be inclined to pursue; that although I am not\r\nauthorized to state what measures will be taken by the United States,\r\nyet I speak confidently of the principles they have adopted, and have\r\nno doubt they will never be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThis is the last communication I shall have the honor to make. It is\r\ndictated by a sincere desire to restore a good intelligence, which\r\nseems to be endangered by the very measure intended to consolidate it.\r\nWhatever be the result, the United States may appeal to the world to\r\nbear witness that in the assertion of the rights of their citizens and\r\nthe dignity of their Government they have never swerved from the respect\r\ndue to themselves and from that which they owe to the Government of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nI pray your excellency to receive the assurance of the high\r\nconsideration with which I have the honor to be, your most obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nEDW. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Livingston to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 29, 1835_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN FORSYTH,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State, etc._\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR: After having by my note to the Duke de Broglie dated the 25th April\r\nlast made a final effort to preserve a good understanding between the\r\nUnited States and France by suggesting such means of accommodation as\r\nI thought were consistent with the honor of the one country to offer and\r\nof the other to accept, I determined to avail myself of the leave to\r\nreturn which was given by your dispatch, No,--, rather than to remain,\r\nas I had desired to do, in England waiting the result of my last\r\ncommunication. This step having been approved by the President, I need\r\nnot here refer to the reasons which induced me to take it. Having\r\nreceived my passports, I left Paris on the 29th of April. At the time\r\nof my departure the note, of which a copy has been transmitted to you,\r\nasking an explanation of the terms used in Mr. Sérurier's communication\r\nto the Department remained unanswered, but I have reason to believe that\r\nthe answer when given will be satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe principal business with which I was charged having thus been brought\r\nto a close, I presume that my services can no longer be useful to my\r\ncountry, and I therefore pray that the President will be pleased to\r\naccept my resignation of the trust with which I have been honored.\r\nI shall terminate it by transmitting to the Department some papers\r\nrelating to matters of minor importance which I soon expect to receive,\r\nand will add the explanations which may yet be wanting to give a full\r\nview of the affairs of the mission up to the time of my leaving France.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, sir, with perfect respect, your most obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nEDW. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forsyth to Mr. Livingston_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, June 30, 1835_.\r\n\r\nEDWARD LIVINGSTON, Esq.,\r\n\r\n_Washington_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Your letter of the 29th instant has been laid before the President,\r\nand I am directed to reply that the President can not allow you, who\r\nhave been so long and usefully employed in the public service, to leave\r\nthe trust last confided to you without an expression of his regard and\r\nrespect, the result of many years of intimate association in peace\r\nand war. Although differing on some points of general policy, your\r\nsingleness of purpose, perfect integrity, and devotion to your country\r\nhave been always known to him. In the embarrassing and delicate position\r\nyou have lately occupied your conduct, and especially your last official\r\nnote in closing your correspondence with the French Government, has met\r\nhis entire approbation, exhibiting as it does, with truth, the anxious\r\ndesire of the Government and the people of the United States to maintain\r\nthe most liberal and pacific relations with the nation to which you were\r\naccredited, and a sincere effort to remove ill-founded impressions and\r\nto soothe the feelings of national susceptibility, even when they have\r\nbeen unexpectedly excited, while at the same time it discourages with a\r\nproper firmness any expectation that the American Government can ever\r\nbe brought to allow an interference inconsistent with the spirit of its\r\ninstitutions or make concessions incompatible with its self-respect. The\r\nPresident is persuaded that he will be sustained in these opinions by\r\nthe undivided sentiment of the American people, and that you will carry\r\ninto a retirement which he trusts may be temporary the consciousness\r\nnot only of having performed your duty, but of having realized the\r\nanticipations of your fellow-citizens and secured for yourself and\r\nyour country the just appreciation of the world.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _December 8, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nexhibiting certain transfers of appropriations that have been made in\r\nthat Department in pursuance of the power vested in the President by the\r\nact of Congress of the 3d of March, 1809, entitled \"An act further to\r\namend the several acts for the establishment and regulation of the\r\nTreasury, War, and Navy Departments.\"\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 9, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I herewith communicate, for the information of Congress, a\r\nreport of the Secretary of War, with accompanying documents, showing the\r\nprogress made during the present year in the astronomical observations\r\nmade under the act of the 14th of July, 1832, relative to the northern\r\nboundary of the State of Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe controversy between the authorities of the State of Ohio and those\r\nof the Territory of Michigan in respect to this boundary assumed about\r\nthe time of the termination of the last session of Congress a very\r\nthreatening aspect, and much care and exertion were necessary to\r\npreserve the jurisdiction of the Territorial government under the acts\r\nof Congress and to prevent a forcible collision between the parties. The\r\nnature and course of the dispute and the measures taken by the Executive\r\nfor the purpose of composing it will fully appear in the accompanying\r\nreport from the Secretary of State and the documents therein referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThe formation of a State government by the inhabitants of the Territory\r\nof Michigan and their application, now pending, to be admitted into the\r\nUnion give additional force to the many important reasons which call for\r\nthe settlement of this question by Congress at their present session.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 9, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: By the act of the 11th of January, 1805, all that part of\r\nthe Indiana Territory lying north of a line drawn due \"east from the\r\nsoutherly bend or extreme of Lake Michigan until it shall intersect Lake\r\nErie, and east of a line drawn from the said southerly bend through the\r\nmiddle of said lake to its northern extremity, and thence due north to\r\nthe northern boundary of the United States,\" was erected into a separate\r\nTerritory by the name of Michigan.\r\n\r\nThe territory comprised within these limits being part of the district\r\nof country described in the ordinance of the 13th of July, 1787, which\r\nprovides that whenever any of the States into which the same should\r\nbe divided should have 60,000 free inhabitants such State should be\r\nadmitted by its delegates into the Congress of the United States on\r\nan equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever,\r\nand shall be at liberty to form a permanent constitution and State\r\ngovernment, provided the constitution and State government so to\r\nbe formed shall be republican, and in conformity to the principles\r\ncontained in these articles, etc., the inhabitants thereof have during\r\nthe present year, in pursuance of the right secured by the ordinance,\r\nformed a constitution and State government. That instrument, together\r\nwith various other documents connected therewith, has been transmitted\r\nto me for the purpose of being laid before Congress, to whom the power\r\nand duty of admitting new States into the Union exclusively appertains;\r\nand the whole are herewith communicated for your early decision.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 17, 1835_.\r\n\r\nThe VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the consideration of the Senate with a view to its\r\nratification, a convention between the United States and the United\r\nMexican States, concluded and signed by the plenipotentiaries of the\r\nrespective parties at the City of Mexico on the 3d of April, 1835, and\r\nthe object of which is to extend the time for the appointment of their\r\ncommissioners and surveyors provided for by the third article of the\r\ntreaty of limits between them of the 12th of January, 1835.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 17, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a report from the Secretary of State,\r\naccompanying copies of certain papers relating to a bequest to the\r\nUnited States by Mr. James Smithson, of London, for the purpose of\r\nfounding \"at Washington an establishment under the name of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, for the increase and diffusion of knowledge\r\namong men.\" The Executive having no authority to take any steps for\r\naccepting the trust and obtaining the funds, the papers are communicated\r\nwith a view to such measures as Congress may deem necessary.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 22, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of Congress, a report from the\r\nWar Department, on the condition of the Cumberland road in the States of\r\nIllinois and Indiana.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 22, 1835_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for their consideration and advice with\r\nregard to its ratification, a convention signed at Paris by the\r\nplenipotentiaries of the United States and the Swiss Confederation on\r\nthe 6th of March last. A copy of the convention is also transmitted for\r\nthe convenience of the Senate.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 23, 1835.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI hereby submit, for the advice and sanction of the Senate, the inclosed\r\nproposal of the Secretary of the Treasury for the investment of the\r\nproceeds of the sales of public lands in behalf of the Chickasaw Indians\r\nunder the treaties therein mentioned.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 11, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHaving laid before Congress on the 9th ultimo the correspondence which\r\nhad previously taken place relative to the controversy between Ohio and\r\nMichigan on the question of boundary between that State and Territory,\r\nI now transmit reports from the Secretaries of State and War on the\r\nsubject, with the papers therein referred to.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 12, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration and advice of the Senate as\r\nto the ratification of the same, the two treaties concluded with the\r\nCarmanchee Indians and with the Caddo Indians referred to in the\r\naccompanying communication from the War Department.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 15, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: In my message at the opening of your session I informed you\r\nthat our chargé d'affaires at Paris had been instructed to ask for the\r\nfinal determination of the French Government in relation to the payment\r\nof the indemnification secured by the treaty of the 4th of July, 1831,\r\nand that when advices of the result should be received it would be made\r\nthe subject of a special communication.\r\n\r\nIn execution of this design I now transmit to you the papers\r\nnumbered from 1 to 13, inclusive, containing among other things the\r\ncorrespondence on this subject between our chargé d'affaires and the\r\nFrench minister of foreign affairs, from which it will be seen that\r\nFrance requires as a condition precedent to the execution of a treaty\r\nunconditionally ratified and to the payment of a debt acknowledged by\r\nall the branches of her Government to be due that certain explanations\r\nshall be made of which she dictates the terms. These terms are such as\r\nthat Government has already been officially informed can not be complied\r\nwith, and if persisted in they must be considered as a deliberate\r\nrefusal on the part of France to fulfill engagements binding by the laws\r\nof nations and held sacred by the whole civilized world. The nature of\r\nthe act which France requires from this Government is clearly set forth\r\nin the letter of the French minister marked No. 4. We will pay the\r\nmoney, says he, when \"_the Government of the United States is ready on\r\nits part to declare to us, by addressing its claim to us officially in\r\nwriting, that it regrets the misunderstanding which has arisen between\r\nthe two countries; that this misunderstanding is founded on a mistake;\r\nthat it never entered into its intention to call in question the good\r\nfaith of the French Government nor to take a menacing attitude toward\r\nFrance.\"_ And he adds: _\"If the Government of the United States does\r\nnot give this assurance we shall be obliged to think that this\r\nmisunderstanding is not the result of an error.\"_ In the letter marked\r\nNo. 6 the French minister also remarks that _\"the Government of the\r\nUnited States knows that upon itself depends henceforward the execution\r\nof the treaty of July 4, 1831_.\"\r\n\r\nObliged by the precise language thus used by the French minister to\r\nview it as a peremptory refusal to execute the treaty except on terms\r\nincompatible with the honor and independence of the United States, and\r\npersuaded that on considering the correspondence now submitted to you\r\nyou can regard it in no other light, it becomes my duty to call your\r\nattention to such measures as the exigency of the case demands if the\r\nclaim of interfering in the communications between the different\r\nbranches of our Government shall be persisted in. This pretension is\r\nrendered the more unreasonable by the fact that the substance of the\r\nrequired explanation has been repeatedly and voluntarily given before it\r\nwas insisted on as a condition--a condition the more humiliating because\r\nit is demanded as the equivalent of a pecuniary consideration. Does\r\nFrance desire only a declaration that we had no intention to obtain our\r\nrights by an address to her fears rather than to her justice? She has\r\nalready had it, frankly and explicitly given by our minister accredited\r\nto her Government, his act ratified by me, and my confirmation of it\r\nofficially communicated by him in his letter to the French minister\r\nof foreign affairs of the 25th of April, 1835, and repeated by my\r\npublished approval of that letter after the passage of the bill of\r\nindemnification. Does France want a degrading, servile repetition of\r\nthis act, in terms which she shall dictate and which will involve\r\nan acknowledgment of her assumed right to interfere in our domestic\r\ncouncils? She will never obtain it. The spirit of the American people,\r\nthe dignity of the Legislature, and the firm resolve of their executive\r\ngovernment forbid it.\r\n\r\nAs the answer of the French minister to our chargé d'affaires at Paris\r\ncontains an allusion to a letter addressed by him to the representative\r\nof France at this place, it now becomes proper to lay before you the\r\ncorrespondence had between that functionary and the Secretary of\r\nState relative to that letter, and to accompany the same with such\r\nexplanations as will enable you to understand the course of the\r\nExecutive in regard to it. Recurring to the historical statement made\r\nat the commencement of your session, of the origin and progress of our\r\ndifficulties with France, it will be recollected that on the return of\r\nour minister to the United States I caused my official approval of the\r\nexplanations he had given to the French minister of foreign affairs to\r\nbe made public. As the French Government had noticed the message without\r\nits being officially communicated, it was not doubted that if they\r\nwere disposed to pay the money due to us they would notice any public\r\nexplanation of the Government of the United States in the same way. But,\r\ncontrary to these well-founded expectations, the French ministry did not\r\ntake this fair opportunity to relieve themselves from their unfortunate\r\nposition and to do justice to the United States.\r\n\r\nWhilst, however, the Government of the United States was awaiting the\r\nmovements of the French Government in perfect confidence that the\r\ndifficulty was at an end, the Secretary of State received a call from\r\nthe French chargé d'affaires in Washington, who desired to read to him\r\na letter he had received from the French minister of foreign affairs.\r\nHe was asked whether he was instructed or directed to make any official\r\ncommunication, and replied that he was only authorized to read the\r\nletter and furnish a copy if requested. The substance of its contents,\r\nit is presumed, may be gathered from Nos. 4 and 6, herewith transmitted.\r\nIt was an attempt to make known to the Government of the United States\r\nprivately in what manner it could make explanations, apparently\r\nvoluntary, but really dictated by France, acceptable to her, and thus\r\nobtain payment of the 25,000,000 francs. No exception was taken to this\r\nmode of communication, which is often used to prepare the way for\r\nofficial intercourse, but the suggestions made in it were in their\r\nsubstance wholly inadmissible. Not being in the shape of an official\r\ncommunication to this Government, it did not admit of reply or official\r\nnotice, nor could it safely be made the basis of any action by the\r\nExecutive or the Legislature, and the Secretary of State did not think\r\nproper to ask a copy, because he could have no use for it. Copies of\r\npapers marked Nos. 9, 10, and 11 shew an attempt on the part of the\r\nFrench chargé d'affaires to place a copy of this letter among the\r\narchives of this Government, which for obvious reasons was not allowed\r\nto be done; but the assurance before given was repeated, that any\r\nofficial communication which he might be authorized to make in the\r\naccustomed form would receive a prompt and just consideration. The\r\nindiscretion of this attempt was made more manifest by the subsequent\r\navowal of the French chargé d'affaires that the object was to bring this\r\nletter before Congress and the American people. If foreign agents, on\r\na subject of disagreement between their government and this, wish to\r\nprefer an appeal to the American people, they will hereafter, it is\r\nhoped, better appreciate their own rights and the respect due to others\r\nthan to attempt to use the Executive as the passive organ of their\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\nIt is due to the character of our institutions that the diplomatic\r\nintercourse of this Government should be conducted with the utmost\r\ndirectness and simplicity, and that in all cases of importance the\r\ncommunications received or made by the Executive should assume the\r\naccustomed official form. It is only by insisting on this form that\r\nforeign powers can be held to full responsibility, that their\r\ncommunications can be officially replied to, or that the advice or\r\ninterference of the Legislature can with propriety be invited by the\r\nPresident. This course is also best calculated, on the one hand, to\r\nshield that officer from unjust suspicions, and on the other to subject\r\nthis portion of his acts to public scrutiny, and, if occasion shall\r\nrequire it, to constitutional animadversion. It was the more necessary\r\nto adhere to these principles in the instance in question inasmuch as,\r\nin addition to other important interests, it very intimately concerned\r\nthe national honor--a matter in my judgment much too sacred to be made\r\nthe subject of private and unofficial negotiation.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that this letter of the French minister of foreign\r\naffairs was read to the Secretary of State on the 11th of September\r\nlast. This was the first authentic indication of the specific views of\r\nthe French Government received by the Government of the United States\r\nafter the passage of the bill of indemnification. Inasmuch as the\r\nletter had been written before the official notice of my approval of\r\nMr. Livingston's last explanation and remonstrance could have reached\r\nParis, just ground of hope was left, as has been before stated, that\r\nthe French Government, on receiving that information in the same manner\r\nas the alleged offensive message had reached them, would desist from\r\ntheir extraordinary demand and pay the money at once. To give them\r\nan opportunity to do so, and, at all events, to elicit their final\r\ndetermination and the ground they intended to occupy, the instructions\r\nwere given to our chargé d'affaires which were adverted to at the\r\ncommencement of the present session of Congress. The result, as you have\r\nseen, is a demand of an official written expression of regrets and a\r\ndirect explanation addressed to France with a distinct intimation that\r\nthis is a _sine qua non_.\r\n\r\nMr. Barton having, in pursuance of his instructions, returned to the\r\nUnited States and the chargé d'affaires of France having been recalled,\r\nall diplomatic intercourse between the two countries is suspended, a\r\nstate of things originating in an unreasonable susceptibility on the\r\npart of the French Government and rendered necessary on our part by\r\ntheir refusal to perform engagements contained in a treaty from the\r\nfaithful performance of which by us they are to this day enjoying many\r\nimportant commercial advantages.\r\n\r\nIt is time that this unequal position of affairs should cease, and that\r\nlegislative action should be brought to sustain Executive exertion in\r\nsuch measures as the case requires. While France persists in her refusal\r\nto comply with the terms of a treaty the object of which was, by\r\nremoving all causes of mutual complaint, to renew ancient feelings of\r\nfriendship and to unite the two nations in the bonds of amity and of a\r\nmutually beneficial commerce, she can not justly complain if we adopt\r\nsuch peaceful remedies as the law of nations and the circumstances of\r\nthe case may authorize and demand. Of the nature of these remedies I\r\nhave heretofore had occasion to speak, and, in reference to a particular\r\ncontingency, to express my conviction that reprisals would be best\r\nadapted to the emergency then contemplated. Since that period France,\r\nby all the departments of her Government, has acknowledged the validity\r\nof our claims and the obligations of the treaty, and has appropriated\r\nthe moneys which are necessary to its execution; and though payment is\r\nwithheld on grounds vitally important to our existence as an independent\r\nnation, it is not to be believed that she can have determined\r\npermanently to retain a position so utterly indefensible. In the\r\naltered state of the questions in controversy, and under all existing\r\ncircumstances, it appears to me that until such a determination shall\r\nhave become evident it will be proper and sufficient to retaliate her\r\npresent refusal to comply with her engagements by prohibiting the\r\nintroduction of French products and the entry of French vessels into our\r\nports. Between this and the interdiction of all commercial intercourse,\r\nor other remedies, you, as the representatives of the people, must\r\ndetermine. I recommend the former in the present posture of our affairs\r\nas being the least injurious to our commerce, and as attended with the\r\nleast difficulty of returning to the usual state of friendly intercourse\r\nif the Government of France shall render us the justice that is due,\r\nand also as a proper preliminary step to stronger measures should their\r\nadoption be rendered necessary by subsequent events.\r\n\r\nThe return of our chargé d'affaires is attended with public notices of\r\nnaval preparations on the part of France destined for our seas. Of the\r\ncause and intent of these armaments I have no authentic information, nor\r\nany other means of judging except such as are common to yourselves and\r\nto the public; but whatever may be their object, we are not at liberty\r\nto regard them as unconnected with the measures which hostile movements\r\non the part of France may compel us to pursue. They at least deserve to\r\nbe met by adequate preparation on our part, and I therefore strongly\r\nurge large and speedy appropriations for the increase of the Navy and\r\nthe completion of our coast defenses.\r\n\r\nIf this array of military force be really designed to affect the action\r\nof the Government and people of the United States on the questions now\r\npending between the two nations, then indeed would it be dishonorable\r\nto pause a moment on the alternative which such a state of things would\r\npresent to us. Come what may, the explanation which France demands can\r\nnever be accorded, and no armament, however powerful and imposing, at a\r\ndistance or on our coast, will, I trust, deter us from discharging the\r\nhigh duties which we owe to our constituents, our national character,\r\nand to the world.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives at the close of the last session of\r\nCongress unanimously resolved that the treaty of the 4th of July, 1831,\r\nshould be maintained and its execution insisted on by the United States.\r\nIt is due to the welfare of the human race not less than to our own\r\ninterests and honor that this resolution should at all hazards be\r\nadhered to. If after so signal an example as that given by the American\r\npeople during their long-protracted difficulties with France of\r\nforbearance under accumulated wrongs and of generous confidence in\r\nher ultimate return to justice she shall now be permitted to withhold\r\nfrom us the tardy and imperfect indemnification which after years of\r\nremonstrance and discussion had at length been solemnly agreed on by\r\nthe treaty of 1831 and to set at naught the obligations it imposes, the\r\nUnited States will not be the only sufferers. The efforts of humanity\r\nand religion to substitute the appeals of justice and the arbitrament of\r\nreason for the coercive measures usually resorted to by injured nations\r\nwill receive little encouragement from such an issue. By the selection\r\nand enforcement of such lawful and expedient measures as may be\r\nnecessary to prevent a result so injurious to ourselves and so fatal to\r\nthe hopes of the philanthropist we shall therefore not only preserve the\r\npecuniary interests of our citizens, the independence of our Government,\r\nand the honor of our country, but do much, it may be hoped, to vindicate\r\nthe faith of treaties and to promote the general interests of peace,\r\ncivilization, and improvement.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 1.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forsyth to Mr. Barton_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, June 28, 1835_.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS P. BARTON, Esq., etc.\r\n\r\nSIR: Mr. Livingston arrived here the day before yesterday. By the\r\nmail of yesterday your letter of the 7th of May, with a copy of\r\nMr. Livingston's last note to the Duke de Broglie, was received.\r\n\r\nAfter an attentive examination of Mr. Livingston's correspondence with\r\nthis Department and the Government of France, elucidated by his verbal\r\nexplanations, the President has directed me to say to you that the\r\nMessrs. de Rothschild have been authorized by the Treasury Department to\r\nreceive the money due under the treaty with France. Of this authority\r\nthey will be directed to give notice to the French Government without\r\ndemanding payment. For yourself, you will, if the bill of indemnity is\r\nrejected, follow Mr. Livingston to the United States. If the money is\r\nplaced at the disposal of the King, conditionally, by the legislature\r\nof France, you will await further orders from the United States,\r\nbut maintain a guarded silence on the subject of the indemnity. If\r\napproached by the Government of France, directly or indirectly, you\r\nwill hear what is said without reply, state what has occurred in full\r\nto the Department, and await its instructions. It is the desire of the\r\nPresident that you will make not even a reference to the subject of the\r\ntreaty in your intercourse with the French Government until the course\r\nintended to be pursued is definitely explained to the United States.\r\nWhatever may be said to the Messrs. de Rothschild it will be their duty\r\nto report to you as well as to the Treasury Department, and whenever\r\nthey converse with you they must be reminded that it is expected that\r\nthey will wait for express notice from the Government of France that\r\nit is ready to pay before an application for payment is made.\r\n\r\nThe course adopted by Mr. Livingston has been fully approved, and\r\nthe hope is indulged that his representations have had their just\r\ninfluence on the counsels of the King of France. However that may be,\r\nthe President's determination is that the terms upon which the two\r\nGovernments are to stand toward each other shall be regulated so far\r\nas his constitutional power extends by France.\r\n\r\nA packet from the Treasury, addressed to the Messrs. de Rothschild, and\r\ncontaining the instructions of the Secretary, accompanied by a special\r\npower appointing them the agents of the United States to receive the\r\npayments due under the treaty of 1831, is forwarded herewith. The copy\r\nof a letter from this Department to M. Pageot is also inclosed for your\r\nperusal.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 2.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forsyth to Mr. Barton_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, September 14, 1835_.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS P. BARTON, Esq., etc.\r\n\r\nSIR: So much time will have elapsed before this dispatch can reach you,\r\nsince the passage of the law by the French Chambers placing at the\r\ndisposition of the King the funds to fulfill the treaty with the United\r\nStates, that it is presumed the intention of the French Government will\r\nhave been by that period disclosed. It is proper therefore, in the\r\nopinion of the President, that you should receive your last instructions\r\nin relation to it. It has always been his intention that the legation of\r\nthe United States should leave France if the treaty were not fulfilled.\r\nYou have been suffered to remain after the departure of Mr. Livingston\r\nunder the expectation that the Government of France would find in all\r\nthat has occurred its obligation to proceed forthwith to the fulfillment\r\nof it as soon as funds were placed in its hands. If this expectation is\r\ndisappointed, you must ask for your passports and return to the United\r\nStates. If no movement has been made on the part of France and no\r\nintimation given to you or to the banker of the United States who is the\r\nauthorized agent of the Treasury to receive the installments due of the\r\ntime that payment will be made, you are instructed to call upon the Duke\r\nde Broglie and request to be informed what are the intentions of the\r\nGovernment in relation to it, stating that you do so by orders of your\r\nGovernment and with a view to regulate your conduct by the information\r\nyou may receive from him. In the present agitated state of France it is\r\nthe particular desire of the President that your application should be\r\nmade in the most conciliatory tone and your interview with the Duke\r\nmarked by expressions, as coming from your Government, of great personal\r\nrespect for that minister and of an anxious desire for the safety of the\r\nKing of France. If the Duke should inform you that the money is to be\r\npaid on any fixed day, you will remain in France; otherwise you will\r\napply for your passports, and state the reason to be that the treaty\r\nof indemnity has not been executed by France.\r\n\r\nThe President especially directs that you should comply with these\r\ninstructions so early that the result may be known here before the\r\nmeeting of Congress, which takes place on the 7th of December next.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 3.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Barton to the Duke de Broglie_.\r\n\r\n[Translation.]\r\n\r\nD.\r\n\r\nLEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 24, 1835_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the DUKE DE BROGLIE,\r\n\r\n_Minister of Foreign Affairs, etc._\r\n\r\nMONSIEUR LE DUC: Having executed to the letter the last instructions of\r\nmy Government in the interview which I had the honor to have with your\r\nexcellency on the 20th of this month, in order further to comply with\r\nthose instructions I am about to return to the United States. Before\r\nleaving France, however, I have thought that it might not be altogether\r\nuseless to address your excellency and to submit to you the conversation\r\nwhich then took place between us, word for word, as I understood it.\r\nIn pursuing this course I am prompted by a double motive: First, by a\r\nsincere desire to avoid even the slightest misunderstanding as to the\r\nprecise meaning of any expressions used on either part, and also with\r\na view, in presenting myself to my Government, to furnish indisputable\r\nproof of my fidelity in executing the instructions with which I had\r\nthe honor to be charged. This last motive, Monsieur le Duc, does not\r\ninterest you personally, but the first, I am sure, will not appear\r\nwithout importance in your eyes.\r\n\r\nHaving said that I was instructed to employ both language and manner the\r\nmost conciliatory, I begged you to believe, should anything appear to\r\nyou not to partake of that character, that the fault must be attributed\r\n_to me alone_, and not to my Government, as in that case I should be\r\ncertain that I neither represented its disposition nor faithfully obeyed\r\nits orders.\r\n\r\nI began the conversation by informing you that I had requested an\r\ninterview by order of my Government, and that on the result of that\r\ninterview would depend my future movements. I said that I was ordered\r\nto convey to the French Government assurances of the very lively\r\nsatisfaction felt by the President on receiving the news and\r\nconfirmation of the King's safety, and that I was further instructed\r\nby the Secretary of State to assure you personally of his high\r\nconsideration. After an obliging answer of your excellency I had\r\nthe honor to submit the following question:\r\n\r\n\"I am instructed by my Government to inquire of your excellency what\r\nare the intentions of His Majesty's Government in relation to the funds\r\nvoted by the Chambers.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I understood you to make the following answer:\r\n\r\n\"Having written a dispatch to His Majesty's chargé d'affaires at\r\nWashington, with instructions to communicate it to Mr. Forsyth, and M.\r\nPageot having read it to Mr. Forsyth, I have nothing to say in addition\r\nto that dispatch.\"\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"I am also instructed to inquire of your excellency whether His\r\nMajesty's Government is ready to pay those funds.\"\r\n\r\nAnd you returned this answer:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in the terms of the dispatch.\"\r\n\r\nI added:\r\n\r\n\"I am instructed to ask another question: Will His Majesty's Government\r\nname any fixed determined period when they will be disposed to pay those\r\nfunds?\"\r\n\r\nTo this question the following was your excellency's answer, as I\r\nunderstood it:\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, if necessary. When the Government of the United States shall\r\nby a written official communication have expressed its regret at the\r\nmisunderstanding which has taken place between the two Governments,\r\nassuring us that this misunderstanding was founded on an error--that\r\nit did not intend to call in question the good faith of His Majesty's\r\nGovernment--the funds are there; we are ready to pay. In the dispatch\r\nto M. Pageot we gave the views of our Government on this question.\r\nMr. Forsyth not having thought proper to accept a copy of that dispatch,\r\nand having said that the Government of the United States could not\r\nreceive a communication in such a form, I have nothing to add. I am\r\nforced to retrench myself behind that dispatch. If the Government of the\r\nUnited States does not give this assurance, we shall be obliged to think\r\nthat this misunderstanding is not the result of an error, and the\r\nbusiness will stop there.\"\r\n\r\nTo your excellency's offer to communicate to me the dispatch to M.\r\nPageot I replied that as my instructions had no reference to that\r\nquestion I did not think myself authorized to discuss it.\r\n\r\nAfter some minutes I rose and said:\r\n\r\n\"In a short time I shall have the honor of writing to your excellency.\"\r\n\r\nYou answered:\r\n\r\n\"I shall at all times receive with pleasure any communication addressed\r\nto me on the part of the Government of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nAnd our conversation ended.\r\n\r\nSuch, Monsieur le Duc, as far as my memory serves me, are the literal\r\nexpressions employed by both of us. Should you discover any inaccuracies\r\nin the relation which I have the honor to submit to you, it will give me\r\npleasure, as it will be my duty, to correct them. If, on the contrary,\r\nthis relation should appear to you in every respect conformable to the\r\ntruth, I take the liberty of claiming from your kindness a confirmation\r\nof it, for the reasons which I have already, I believe, sufficiently\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nI eagerly avail myself of this occasion, Monsieur le Duc, to renew the\r\nassurances of very high consideration with which I have the honor to be,\r\nyour excellency's most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTHOS.

BARTON,\r\n\r\n_Chargé de Affaires of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have received the letter which you did me the honor to address to\r\nme on the 24th of this month.\r\n\r\nYou are desirous to give your Government a faithful account of the\r\nconversation which you had with me on the 20th. While communicating\r\nto me a statement of that conversation you request me to indicate the\r\ninvoluntary errors which I may remark in it. I appreciate the motives\r\nwhich influence you and the importance which you attach to the exactness\r\nof this statement, and I therefore hasten to point out three errors\r\nwhich have found their way into your report, acknowledging at the same\r\ntime its perfect conformity on all other points with the explanations\r\ninterchanged between us.\r\n\r\nIn reply to your question _whether the King's Government would name any\r\nfixed and determinate period at which it would be disposed to pay the\r\ntwenty-five millions_ you make me say:\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, if necessary. When the Government of the United States shall\r\nby a written official communication have expressed its regret at the\r\nmisunderstanding which has taken place between the two Governments,\r\nassuring us that this misunderstanding is founded on an error--that it\r\ndid not intend to call in question the good faith of His Majesty's\r\nGovernment,\" etc.\r\n\r\nNow, this is what I really said:\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, to-day, immediately, if the Government of the United States\r\nis ready on its part to declare to us, by addressing its claim\r\n(_réclamation_) to us officially in writing that it regrets the\r\nmisunderstanding which has arisen between the two countries; that this\r\nmisunderstanding is founded upon a mistake, and that it never entered\r\ninto its intention (_pensée_) to call in question the good faith of the\r\nFrench Government nor to take a menacing attitude toward France.\"\r\n\r\nBy the terms of your report I am made to have continued thus:\r\n\r\n\"In the dispatch to M. Pageot we gave the views of our Government on\r\nthis question. Mr. Forsyth not having thought proper to accept a copy of\r\nthat dispatch, and having said that the Government of the United States\r\ncould not receive the communication in that form,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThat was not what I said, because such was not the language of Mr.\r\nForsyth to M. Pageot. On refusing the copy offered to him by that chargé\r\nd'affaires Mr. Forsyth gave as the only reason _that it was a document\r\nof which he could make no use_, and that was the phrase repeated by me.\r\n\r\nMr. Forsyth made no objection to the form which I had adopted\r\nto communicate to the Federal Government the views of the King's\r\nGovernment; in fact, not only is there nothing unusual in that form,\r\nnot only is it employed in the intercourse between one government and\r\nanother whenever there is a desire to avoid the irritation which might\r\ninvoluntarily arise from an exchange of contradictory notes in a direct\r\ncontroversy, but reflection on the circumstances and the respective\r\npositions of the two countries will clearly show that it was chosen\r\nprecisely in a spirit of conciliation and regard for the Federal\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nFinally, sir, after having said, \"If the Government of the United States\r\ndoes not give this assurance we shall be obliged to think that this\r\nmisunderstanding is not the result of an error,\" I did not add, \"and the\r\nbusiness will stop there.\" This last error is, however, of so little\r\nimportance that I hesitated to notice it.

JOHN FORSYTH,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: On the 11th of September last I had the honor, as I was authorized,\r\nto read to you a dispatch which his excellency the minister of foreign\r\naffairs had addressed to me on the 17th of June previous, respecting the\r\nstate of the relations between France and the United States. The object\r\nof this communication was to make known to the Cabinet of Washington,\r\nin a form often employed, the point of view from which the King's\r\nGovernment regarded the difficulties between the two countries, and to\r\nindicate the means by which, in its opinion, they might be terminated in\r\na manner honorable to both Governments. I was also authorized to allow\r\nyou, in case you should desire it, to take a copy of this dispatch,\r\nbut, contrary to the expectation which diplomatic usages in such cases\r\npermitted me to entertain, you thought proper to refuse to request it.\r\n\r\nI regretted this resolution of yours, sir, at the time, because, in\r\nthe first place, it appeared to be at variance with (_s' écarter de_)\r\nthat conciliatory spirit which so particularly characterized the\r\ncommunication just made to you, and, next, as it seemed in a manner\r\nto deprive the Cabinet of Washington of the means of knowing in their\r\nfull extent the views of the King's Government, of which an attentive\r\nexamination of the Duke de Broglie's letter could alone have enabled it\r\nto form a just estimate. These regrets, sir, have not been diminished,\r\nand at the moment when the President is about to communicate to Congress\r\nthe state of the relations between France and the United States I\r\nconsider it useful and necessary for the interests of all to endeavor to\r\nplace him in possession of all the facts which may afford him the means\r\nof giving an exact account of the real dispositions and views of the\r\nKing's Government on the subject of the existing difficulties.\r\n\r\nWith this intention, and from a desire to neglect nothing which,\r\nby offering to the American Government another opportunity of making\r\nitself acquainted minutely with the highly conciliatory sentiments of\r\nHis Majesty's Government, may contribute to restore good understanding\r\nbetween the Cabinets of Paris and Washington, I have the honor to\r\ntransmit to you a copy of the Duke de Broglie's dispatch and to request\r\nyou to place it under the eye of the President.\r\n\r\nI embrace this opportunity, sir, to renew to you the assurance of the\r\nhigh consideration with which I have the honor to be, your most humble\r\nand most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. PAGEOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 10.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forsyth to Mr. Pageot_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, December 3, 1835_.\r\n\r\nM. PAGEOT,\r\n\r\n_Chargé d'Affaires, etc._\r\n\r\nSIR: I had yesterday the honor to receive your note of the 1st instant,\r\nwith the accompanying paper, purporting to be a copy of a letter\r\naddressed under date of the 17th of June last by His Excellency the\r\nDuke de Broglie, minister of foreign affairs of France, to yourself.\r\n\r\nAfter referring to what occurred in our interview of the 11th September\r\nin regard to the original letter, and expressing your regrets at the\r\ncourse I then felt it my duty to take, you request me to place the copy\r\ninclosed in your letter under the eye of the President.\r\n\r\nIn allowing you during that interview to read to me the Duke de\r\nBroglie's dispatch, which I cheerfully did, you were enabled to avail\r\nyourself of that informal mode of apprising this Department of the views\r\nof your Government in the full extent authorized by diplomatic usage.\r\nThe question whether or not I should ask a copy of that dispatch was\r\nof course left, as it should have been, by your Government exclusively\r\nto my discretion. My reasons for not making that request were frankly\r\nstated to you, founded on a conviction that in the existing state of the\r\nrelations between the two countries the President would think it most\r\nproper that every communication upon the subject in difference between\r\nthem designed to influence his conduct should, before it was submitted\r\nto his consideration, be made to assume the official form belonging to\r\na direct communication from one government to another by which alone\r\nhe could be enabled to cause a suitable reply to be given to it and to\r\nsubmit it, should such a step become necessary, to his associates in the\r\nGovernment. I had also the honor at the same time to assure you that any\r\ndirect communication from yourself as the representative of the King's\r\nGovernment to me, embracing the contents of this dispatch or any other\r\nmatter you might be authorized to communicate in the accustomed mode,\r\nwould be laid without delay before the President, and would undoubtedly\r\nreceive from him an early and just consideration.\r\n\r\nIt can not have escaped your reflections that my duty required that\r\nthe circumstances of the interview between us should be reported\r\nto the President, and that the discovery of any error on my part in\r\nrepresenting his views of the course proper to be pursued on that\r\noccasion would without fail have been promptly communicated to you.\r\nThat duty was performed. The substance of our interview and the reasons\r\nby which my course in it had been guided were immediately communicated to\r\nand entirely approved by him. I could not, therefore, have anticipated\r\nthat after so long a period had elapsed, and without any change in the\r\ncondition of affairs, you should have regarded it as useful or proper\r\nto revive the subject at the time and in the form you have seen fit to\r\nadopt. Cordially reciprocating, however, the conciliatory sentiments\r\nexpressed in your note, and in deference to your request, I have again\r\nconsulted the President on the subject, and am instructed to inform\r\nyou that the opinion expressed by me in the interview between us,\r\nand subsequently confirmed by him, remains unchanged, and I therefore\r\nrespectfully restore to you the copy of the Duke de Broglie's letter,\r\nas I can not make the use of it which you desired.\r\n\r\nI am also instructed to say that the President entertains a decided\r\nconviction that a departure in the present case from the ordinary and\r\naccustomed method of international communication is calculated to\r\nincrease rather than to diminish the difficulties unhappily existing\r\nbetween France and the United States, and that its observance in their\r\nfuture intercourse will be most likely to bring about the amicable\r\nadjustment of those difficulties on terms honorable to both parties.\r\nSuch a result is sincerely desired by him, and he will omit nothing\r\nconsistent with the faithful discharge of his duties to the United\r\nStates by which it may be promoted. In this spirit I am directed by him\r\nto repeat to you the assurance made in our interview in September last,\r\nthat any official communication you may think proper to address to this\r\nGovernment will promptly receive such consideration as may be due to its\r\ncontents and to the interests involved in the subject to which it may\r\nrefer.\r\n\r\nAs the inclosed paper is not considered the subject of reply, you will\r\nallow me to add, for the purpose of preventing any misconception in this\r\nrespect, that my silence in regard to its contents is not to be\r\nconstrued as admitting the accuracy of any of the statements or\r\nreasonings contained in it.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to renew, etc.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 11.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Pageot to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\n[Translation.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 5, 1835_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN FORSYTH,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I yesterday evening received the letter which you did me the honor\r\nto write to me on the 3d of this month. With it you return to me the\r\ncopy of a dispatch which I had transmitted to you two days before, and\r\nthe original of which was addressed to me on the 17th of June last by\r\nhis excellency the minister of foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nI will not seek, sir, to disguise from you the astonishment produced in\r\nme by the return of a document so very important in the present state of\r\nthe relations between the two countries; neither will I undertake to\r\nreply to the reasons on which this determination of yours is based.\r\nMy intention in communicating this document to you in a form not only\r\nsanctioned by the diplomatic usages of all nations and all ages, but\r\nalso the most direct which I could possibly have chosen, was to make\r\nknown the real dispositions of my Government to the President of the\r\nUnited States, and through him to Congress and the American people,\r\nconceiving that in the existing situation of the two countries it was\r\nessential that each Government should fully comprehend the intentions\r\nof the other. This consideration appeared to me paramount to all others.\r\nYou have judged otherwise, sir, and you have thought that whatever might\r\nbe the importance of a communication it was proper before receiving it\r\nto examine whether the form in which it came to you were strictly\r\naccordant with the usages necessary, in your opinion, to be observed in\r\ndiplomatic transactions with the Government of the Republic. I will not\r\ninsist further. I have fulfilled all the duties which appeared to be\r\nprescribed for me by the spirit of reconciliation, in conjunction with\r\nthe respect due by me to all communications from my Government, and\r\nnothing more remains for me than to express my deep regret that the\r\nmisunderstanding between the two Governments, already so serious, should\r\nbe kept up, not by weighty difficulties which involve the interests and\r\nthe dignity of the two countries, but by questions of form as uncertain\r\nin their principles as doubtful in their application.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to renew to you, sir, the assurances of my high\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nA.

The protection of the Federal Government is due and will\r\nof course be extended to you during the time necessary for your\r\npreparations to return to France.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, with great consideration, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\nLEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 29, 1835_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency COUNT DE RIGNY,\r\n\r\n_Minister Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Having already had occasion to acknowledge the receipt of your\r\nexcellency's letter of the 13th instant, and to answer that part of it\r\nwhich most urgently required my attention, I proceed to a consideration\r\nof the other matters which it contains. I shall do this with a sincere\r\ndesire to avoid everything that may excite irritation or increase\r\ndifficulties which already unfortunately exist. Guided by this\r\ndisposition, I shall confine myself to an examination of your note,\r\nconsidered only as an exposition of the causes which His Majesty's\r\nGovernment thinks it has to complain of in the message sent by the\r\nPresident of the United States to Congress at the opening of its present\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nYour excellency begins by observing that nothing could have prepared\r\nHis Majesty's Government for the impressions made upon it by the\r\nPresident's message, and that if the complaints he makes were as just as\r\nyou think them unfounded, still you would have reason to be astonished\r\nat receiving _the first communication of them in such a form_. If His\r\nMajesty's Government was not prepared to receive complaints on the part\r\nof the United States for nonexecution of the treaty, everything I have\r\nsaid and written since I have had the honor of communicating with your\r\nexcellency and your predecessors in office must have been misunderstood\r\nor forgotten. I can scarcely suppose the first, for if my whole\r\ncorrespondence is referred to and my verbal representations\r\nrecollected they will be found in the most unequivocal language to\r\nexpress an extreme solicitude for the execution of the treaty, a\r\ndeep disappointment at the several delays which have intervened, and\r\nemphatically the necessity which the President would be under of laying\r\nthe matter before Congress at the time when in fact he has done so if\r\nbefore that period he did not receive notice that the law had passed for\r\ngiving effect to the treaty. To urge the obligation of the treaty, to\r\nprepare His Majesty's Government for the serious consequences that must\r\nresult from its breach or an unnecessary delay in executing it, was my\r\nduty, and it has been faithfully and unremittingly executed. To my own\r\nofficial representation on the 26th I added on the 29th July last the\r\nprecise instructions I had received, to inform His Majesty's Government\r\nthat \"the President could not avoid laying before Congress on the 1st of\r\nDecember a full statement of the position of affairs on this interesting\r\nsubject, or permit the session to end, as it must do on the 3d March,\r\nwithout recommending such measures as the justice and the honor of the\r\ncountry may require.\"\r\n\r\nIn this alone, then, there was sufficient, independently of my numerous\r\napplications and remonstrances, to prepare His Majesty's Government\r\nfor the just complaints of the United States and for the \"impression\"\r\nthey ought to produce, as well as for the \"_mode_\" in which they were\r\ncommunicated, a mode clearly pointed out in the passage I have quoted\r\nfrom my note of the 29th of July--that is to say, by the annual message\r\nfrom the President to Congress, which, as I have already had occasion\r\nto observe, His Majesty's ministers have erroneously considered as\r\naddressed directly to them, and, viewing it in that light, have\r\narraigned this document as containing groundless complaints, couched in\r\nlanguage not called for by the occasion, and offering for consideration\r\nmeans of redress offensive to the dignity of France. I shall endeavor by\r\na plain exposition of facts to repel those charges. I shall examine them\r\nwith the freedom the occasion requires, but, suppressing the feelings\r\nwhich some parts of your excellency's letter naturally excite, will, as\r\nfar as possible, avoid all those topics for recrimination which press\r\nupon my mind. The observation I am about to make will not be deemed a\r\ndeparture from this rule, because it is intended to convey information\r\nwhich seems to have been wanted by His Majesty's minister when on a late\r\noccasion he presented a law to the Chamber of Deputies. It is proper,\r\ntherefore, to state that although the military title of general was\r\ngloriously acquired by the present head of the American Government,\r\nhe is not in official language designated as _General Jackson_, but as\r\n\"the President of the United States,\" and that his communication was\r\nmade in that character.\r\n\r\nI proceed now to the examination of that portion of your excellency's\r\nletter which attempts to show that the complaints set forth in the\r\nPresident's message are groundless.\r\n\r\nIt begins by assuming as a principle of argument that after the Chamber\r\nof Deputies had rejected the law and His Majesty's Government had\r\npromised to present it anew the United States had by receiving that\r\npromise given up all right to complain of any anterior delays. I have\r\nvainly endeavored, sir, to find any rule of reasoning by which this\r\nargument can be supported. It would undoubtedly be much easier to strike\r\noff from the case the delays of two years in proposing the law than to\r\njustify them.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the United States, with a moderation and forbearance\r\nfor which they receive no credit, waited two years, almost without\r\ncomplaint, for the performance of a treaty which engaged the faith of\r\nthe French nation to pay a just indemnity, for which they had already\r\nwaited more than twenty years. It is true that His Majesty's Government\r\noffered solemn assurances that as soon as the constitution of the\r\ncountry would permit a new attempt would be made to redeem the national\r\npledge given by the treaty. It is true also that the President of the\r\nUnited States gave credit to those assurances; but it is also true--and\r\nyour excellency seems to lose sight of that important uncontested\r\nfact--that formal notice was given that the performance of those\r\npromises would be expected according to their letter, and that he\r\ncould delay no longer than the 1st of December the execution of a duty\r\nwhich those assurances had induced him to postpone. Whatever reasons\r\nHis Majesty's Government had for not complying with Mr. Sérurier's\r\nengagement, or however they may have interpreted it, the President could\r\nnot be precluded from considering the whole case as open and adding to\r\nhis statement the wrongs occasioned by the delays anterior to the vote\r\nof rejection. Those delays are still unaccounted for, and are rendered\r\nmore questionable by the preference given to another treaty, although\r\nsubsequently made, for the guarantee of the Greek loan.\r\n\r\nConfining your observations to this second period, you say that the\r\nreproaches which the President thinks himself authorized in making to\r\nFrance may be comprised in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"The Government of the King had promised to present the treaty of July\r\nanew to the Chambers as soon as they could be assembled; but they have\r\nbeen assembled on the 31st of July of the last year and the treaty has\r\nnot yet been presented.\"\r\n\r\nStating this as the whole of the complaint, you proceed, sir, in your\r\nendeavor to refute it.\r\n\r\nI am obliged, reluctantly, here to make use of arguments which in the\r\ncourse of this discussion have been often repeated, but which seem to\r\nhave made no impression on His Majesty's Government. I am obliged, in\r\nrepelling the reproaches addressed to the President, to bring to your\r\nrecollection the terms of the promise on which he relied, the\r\ncircumstances attending it, and the object for which it was given. These\r\nmust be fully understood and fully waived before the question between us\r\ncan be resolved.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which Mr. Sérurier's note was written are\r\nmaterial in considering its true import. The payment stipulated by a\r\ntreaty duly ratified on both sides had just been formally refused by a\r\nvote of the Chamber of Deputies. More than two years had passed since\r\nit had been proclaimed as the law of the land in the United States,\r\nand ever since the articles favorable to France had been in constant\r\noperation. Notice of this refusal had some time before been received by\r\nthe President. It would have been his duty, had nothing else occurred,\r\nto communicate to Congress this event, so unexpected and so injurious to\r\nthe interest of the country. One circumstance prevented the performance\r\nof this duty and justified the omission. The notice of the rejection was\r\naccompanied by information that the minister of France was instructed to\r\nmake explanations and engagements on the subject, and that a ship of\r\nwar would be dispatched with his instructions. The President had waited\r\na month for the arrival of this ship. An unusually long session of\r\nCongress still afforded an opportunity for making the communication,\r\neven after her arrival. If made it would undoubtedly have produced\r\nconsequences the nature of which may be imagined by considering the\r\nevents that have since occurred. It was necessary, then, to prevent an\r\ninterruption of the friendly relations between the two countries, that\r\nthis communication should be postponed until the subsequent session\r\nof Congress; longer than that it was well known that it could not be\r\ndeferred. This was clearly and explicitly stated in a conference between\r\nMr. Sérurier and the Secretary of State of the United States, in which\r\nthe former gave the promise in question. But the President desired to\r\nhave the engagement in a written and official form (and as Mr. Sérurier\r\nexpresses it in his letter), \"_pour des causes prises dans les\r\nnécessités de votre Gouvernement_\" What governmental necessity does he\r\nallude to? Clearly that which obliged the President to communicate these\r\nengagements to Congress at the next session.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have a stipulation made under special orders, sent\r\nout by a ship dispatched for that express purpose, communicated first\r\nverbally in an official conference, afterwards reduced to writing and\r\ndelivered to the proper officers, for the double purpose of justifying\r\nthe President for not making an immediate communication at their then\r\nsession and also to serve as a pledge which he might exhibit if\r\nunredeemed at their next. These objects are well stated by Mr. Sérurier\r\nto be \"that the Government of the Republic may avoid, with a\r\nprovidential solicitude, _in this unsettled state of things_ all that\r\nmay become a cause of new irritation between the two countries, endanger\r\nthe treaty, and raise obstacles that may become insurmountable to the\r\nviews of conciliation and harmony which animate the councils of the\r\nKing.\" It was, then, to avoid a communication to Congress, which Mr.\r\nSérurier saw would endanger the peace of the two countries, that this\r\nengagement was made. Surely, then, every word of a stipulation made\r\nunder such circumstances and for such important purposes must have been\r\nduly considered and its import properly weighed, first by the cabinet\r\nwho directed, afterwards by the minister who delivered and the\r\nGovernment which received it.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was this engagement? First, that the Government of the King\r\nwill use every legal and constitutional effort which its persevering\r\npersuasion of the justice and advantages of the treaty authorize\r\nthe United States to expect from it. \"Son intention est\" (I quote\r\nliterally), \"_en outre_\" (that is, besides using those endeavors above\r\nmentioned), \"de faire tout ce que _not re constitution permet_ pour\r\nrapprocher autant que possible l'époque de la presentation nouvelle de\r\nla loi rejettée.\" Your excellency can not fail to have observed two\r\ndistinct parts in this engagement--one relating to the endeavors the\r\nministry promise to make in order to induce the Chambers to pass the\r\nlaw, for the success of which they could not answer; another relating\r\nto the time of presentation of the law, a matter which depended on\r\nthem alone, restricted only by constitutional forms.\r\n\r\nThe promise on this point, then, was precise, and could not be\r\nmisunderstood. Whatever the _constitution of France permitted_, the\r\nGovernment of France promised to do in order to hasten the presentation\r\nof the law. What was the cause of this desire to bring the business\r\nbefore the Chambers at an early day? No one can doubt it who knows\r\nthe situation of the two countries, still less anyone who has read the\r\ncorrespondence. It was to enable the President to make those statements\r\nto the next Congress which, relying on the engagements of the French\r\nminister, he had omitted to make to this.\r\n\r\nIt was clear, therefore, that more was required than the expression of a\r\ndesire on the part of His Majesty's ministers to execute the treaty--a\r\ndesire the sincerity of which was not doubted, but which might be\r\nunavailing, as its accomplishment depended on the vote of the Chambers.\r\nFor the President's satisfaction, and for his justification too, an\r\nengagement was offered and accepted for the performance of an act which\r\ndepended on His Majesty's Government alone. This engagement was couched\r\nin the unequivocal terms I have literally quoted.\r\n\r\nThis, sir, is not all. That there might be no misunderstanding on the\r\nsubject, this promise, with the sense in which it was understood, the\r\nimportant object for which it was given, and the serious consequences\r\nthat might attend a failure to comply with it, were urged in\r\nconversation, and repeated in my official letters, particularly those\r\nof the 26th and 29th of July and 3d and 9th of August last, in which\r\nits performance was strongly pressed.\r\n\r\nThe answers to these letters left no hope that the question would be\r\nsubmitted to the Chambers in time to have the result known before the\r\nadjournment of Congress, and by the refusal to hasten the convocation of\r\nthe Chambers before the last of December showed unequivocally that, so\r\nfar from taking all measures permitted by the constitution to _hasten_\r\nthe period of presenting the law, it was to be left to the most remote\r\nperiod of the ordinary course of legislation.\r\n\r\nThis decision of His Majesty's Government, contained in your\r\nexcellency's note to me of the 7th August, was duly transmitted to the\r\nPresident, and it naturally produced upon his mind the impressions which\r\nI anticipated in my letters to your excellency that it would produce.\r\nHe saw with the deepest regret that a positive assurance for convening\r\nthe Chambers as soon as the constitution would permit was construed to\r\nmean only a disposition to do so, and that this disposition had yielded\r\nto objections which he could not think of sufficient force to justify a\r\ndelay even if there had intervened no promise, especially as the serious\r\nconsequences of that delay had been earnestly and repeatedly brought to\r\nthe consideration of His Majesty's Government. In fact, sir, what were\r\nthose objections? I do not speak of those which were made to presenting\r\nthe law in the session of July last, for although no constitutional\r\nimpediment offered itself, yet it was not strongly insisted on, because\r\nan early session in the autumn, would have the same effect; and the\r\nPresident, for the same reason, says that it might have been overlooked\r\nif an early call of the Chambers had been made. They are the objections\r\nto this call, then, which immediately demand our attention. What, in\r\nfact, were they? None derived from the constitutional charter have been\r\nor could have been asserted. What, then, were they? Your excellency's\r\nletter of the 3d of August to me contains none but this: \"His Majesty's\r\nGovernment finds it impossible to make any positive engagement on that\r\npoint.\" In that of the 7th of August there are two reasons assigned:\r\nFirst, the general inconvenience to the members. This the President\r\ncould surely not think of alleging to Congress as a sufficient reason\r\nfor omitting to lay the matter before them. The next, I confess, has\r\na little more weight, and might have excused a delay if the assurance\r\ngiven by Mr. Sérurier had been, as your excellency construes it,\r\nmerely of a _disposition_ to hasten the presentation of the law.\r\nIf the engagement had amounted to no more than this, and His Majesty's\r\nministers thought that an early call would endanger the passage of\r\nthe law, it might possibly justify _them_ in not making it. But the\r\nPresident, who relied on the promise he had received, who in consequence\r\nof it had deferred the performance of an important duty; the President,\r\nwho had given timely and official notice that this duty must be\r\nperformed at the opening of the next Congress; the President, who could\r\nsee no greater prospect of the passage of the law in a winter than in an\r\nautumnal session--how was _he_ to justify himself and redeem the pledge\r\n_he_ had made to his country? He did it in the way he always does--by a\r\nstrict performance.\r\n\r\nFrom this detail your excellency will, I hope, see that the President's\r\ncauses of complaint can not, as you suppose, be confined within the\r\nnarrow limit you have assigned to them. The failure to present the law\r\nin the session of July was not the only, nor even the principal, point\r\nin which he thought the engagement of Mr. Sérurier uncomplied with;\r\nfor although he saw no reason for the omission that could be called\r\na constitutional one, yet he expressly says that might have been\r\noverlooked. He always (it can not too often be repeated) looked to the\r\npromise of Mr. Sérurier as it was given at Washington, not as it was\r\ninterpreted at Paris, and he had a right to believe that as on previous\r\noccasions the Legislature had, in the years 1819, 1822, 1825, and 1830,\r\nheld their sessions for the transaction of the ordinary business in\r\nthe months of July and August, he had a right, I say, to believe that\r\nthere was no insurmountable objection to the consideration of this\r\nextraordinary case, enforced by a positive promise. Yet, as I have\r\nremarked, he did not make this his principal cause of complaint; it\r\nwas the omission to call the Chambers at an earlier period than the\r\nvery end of the year.\r\n\r\nOn this head your excellency is pleased to observe that the same\r\nreasons, drawn from the usual course of administration, which rendered\r\nthe presentation of the law in the session of July impossible applied\r\nwith nearly the same force to a call before the end of the year; and\r\nyou appeal to the President's knowledge of the \"fixed principles of a\r\nconstitutional system\" to prove that the administration under such a\r\ngovernment is subject to regular and permanent forms, \"from which no\r\nspecial interest, however important, should induce it to deviate.\" For\r\nthis branch of the argument it unfortunately happens that no regular\r\nform of administration, no fixed principle, no usage whatever, would\r\nhave opposed a call of the Chambers at an early day, and the rule which\r\nyour excellency states would not be broken \"in favor of any interest,\r\nhowever important,\" has actually been made to yield to one of domestic\r\noccurrence. _The Chambers have just been convened before the period\r\nwhich was declared to be the soonest at which they could possibly meet_.\r\nYour excellency will also excuse me for remarking that since the first\r\ninstitution of the Chambers, in 1814, there have been convocations\r\nfor every month of the year, without exception, which I will take the\r\nliberty of bringing to your recollection by enumerating the different\r\ndates. The Chambers were summoned for the month of January in the years\r\n1823, 1826, and 1829; for February, in the years 1827 and 1829; for\r\nMarch, in 1815, 1824, and 1830; for April, in 1833; for May, in 1814;\r\nfor June, in 1815, 1822, and 1825; for July, in 1834; for August,\r\nin 1830 and 1831; for September, in 1815; for October, in 1816; for\r\nNovember, in 1817, 1818, 1819, 1821, and 1832; and for December, in\r\n1820, 1824, 1826, and 1833. It is, then, clear to demonstration that\r\nneither constitutional impediment nor stern, inflexible usage prevented\r\nsuch a call of the Chambers as would have complied with the letter of\r\nMr. Sérurier's engagement. Since I have alluded to the actual meeting of\r\nthe Chambers on the 1st of December, it is but candid to allow that even\r\nthis period would not have enabled the President to have attained one\r\nof his objects--the presenting of the result of their deliberations to\r\nCongress in his opening message. But even that slight concession, if\r\nit had been made to my unceasing applications, might have given an\r\nopportunity of conveying their decision to Congress before the 4th\r\nof March, when they must adjourn, because, had that day been then\r\ndetermined on, everything would have been ready to lay before the\r\nChambers on the opening of the session; but a meeting a month or six\r\nweeks earlier would have given ample time for deliberation and decision\r\nin season to have it known at Washington on the 1st of December.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of giving time to the new members to inform themselves\r\nof the nature of the question and the old ones to recover from the\r\nimpression which erroneous statements had made upon their minds I\r\nunderstand to be the remaining motive of His Majesty's ministers for\r\ndelaying the meeting; but this was a precaution which, relying on the\r\nplain obligation of the treaty, the President could not appreciate, and\r\nhe must, moreover, have thought that if a long discussion was necessary\r\nto understand the merits of the question it was an additional reason for\r\nhastening the meeting where those merits were to be discussed. The delay\r\nthat occurred between the meeting of the Chambers and the 1st of January\r\nneed not have entered into the discussion, because, not long known at\r\nWashington, it could not have had any influence on the message. It is\r\nreferred to, I presume, in order to show that it was produced by a\r\ndesire on the part of His Majesty's ministers the better to assure the\r\npassage of the law. Of this, sir, I never had a doubt, and immediately\r\nso advised my Government, and informed it (as was the fact) that I\r\nperfectly acquiesced in the delay; first, because of the circumstance to\r\nwhich you allude; secondly, because the statements originally intended\r\nto be ready by the 1st of January were not yet prepared. There is a\r\nslight error in this part of your excellency's letter; the delay was\r\nnot made at my request, but was fully approved of, for the reasons\r\nwhich I have stated.\r\n\r\nI have entered into this detail, sir, not for the purpose of\r\nrecrimination, which, in most cases useless, would in this be worse, but\r\nwith the object, as was my duty, of showing that although the ministers\r\nof the King, under the interpretation they seem to have given to Mr.\r\nSérurier's promise, may have considered themselves at liberty to defer\r\nthe presentation of the law until the period which they thought would\r\nbest secure its success, yet the President, interpreting that promise\r\ndifferently, feeling that in consequence of it he had forborne to do\r\nwhat might be strictly called a duty, and seeing that its performance\r\nhad not taken place, could not avoid stating the whole case clearly and\r\ndistinctly to Congress and detailing to them all the remedies which the\r\nlaw of nations would allow to be applied to the case, leaving to them\r\nthe choice, leaving to their wisdom and prudence the option, of the\r\nalternative of further delay or conditional action. Could he have said\r\nless in this branch of his message? If he alluded to the subject at\r\nall, he was obliged to detail the circumstances of the case. It is\r\nnot pretended that this is not done with fidelity as to facts. The\r\nratification of the treaty, its effect in pledging the faith of the\r\nnation, the fidelity with which the United States have executed it,\r\nthe delay that intervened before it was brought before the Chambers,\r\ntheir rejection of the law, the assurances made by Mr. Sérurier, the\r\nforbearance of the President to make a communication to Congress in\r\nconsequence of those assurances, and the adjournment of the question by\r\nHis Majesty's Government to the end of the year--none of these have ever\r\nbeen denied, and all this the President was obliged to bring before\r\nCongress if, as I have said, he spoke on the subject. But he was obliged\r\nby a solemn duty to speak of it, and he had given timely and repeated\r\nnotice of this obligation. The propositions which he submitted to\r\nCongress in consequence of those facts were a part of his duty. They\r\nwere, as I have stated, exclusively addressed to that body, and in\r\noffering them he felt and expressed a proper regret, and, doing justice\r\nto the character and high feeling of the French nation, he explicitly\r\ndisavowed any intention of influencing it by a menace.\r\n\r\nI have no mission, sir, to offer any modification of the President's\r\ncommunication to Congress, and I beg that what I have said may be\r\nconsidered with the reserve that I do not acknowledge any right to\r\ndemand or any obligation to give explanations of a document of that\r\nnature. But the relations which previously existed between the two\r\ncountries, a desire that no unnecessary misunderstanding should\r\ninterrupt them, and the tenor of your excellency's letter (evidently\r\nwritten under excited feeling) all convinced me that it was not\r\nincompatible with self-respect and the dignity of my country to enter\r\ninto the detail I have done. The same reasons induced me to add that the\r\nidea erroneously entertained that an injurious menace is contained in\r\nthe message has prevented your excellency from giving a proper attention\r\nto its language. A cooler examination will show that although the\r\nPresident was obliged, as I have demonstrated, to state to Congress\r\nthe engagements which had been made, and that in his opinion they had\r\nnot been complied with, yet in a communication not addressed to His\r\nMajesty's Government not a disrespectful term is employed, nor a phrase\r\nthat his own sense of propriety, as well as the regard which one\r\nnation owes to another, would induce him to disavow. On the contrary,\r\nexpressions of sincere regret that circumstances obliged him to complain\r\nof acts that disturbed the harmony he wished to preserve with a nation\r\nand Government to the high characters of which he did ample justice.\r\n\r\nAn honorable susceptibility to everything that may in the remotest\r\ndegree affect the honor of the country is a national sentiment in\r\nFrance; but you will allow, sir, that it is carried too far when it\r\nbecomes impatient of just complaint, when it will allow none of its\r\nacts to be arraigned and considers as an offense a simple and correct\r\nexamination of injuries received and as an insult a deliberation on the\r\nmeans of redress. If it is forbidden, under the penalties of giving just\r\ncause of offense, for the different branches of a foreign government to\r\nconsult together on the nature of wrongs it has received and review the\r\nseveral remedies which the law of nations present and circumstances\r\njustify, then no such consultation can take place in a government like\r\nthat of the United States, where all the proceedings are public, without\r\nat once incurring the risk of war, which it would be the very object of\r\nthat consultation to avoid.\r\n\r\nThe measures announced in the close of your letter, as well as the\r\ncorrespondence that it has occasioned between us, have been transmitted\r\nto my Government, and I wait the instructions which that communication\r\nwill produce.\r\n\r\nI pray your excellency to receive the renewed assurance of the high\r\nconsideration with which I have the honor to be, your most obedient,\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nEDW. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nThis letter was referred to in my message of the 7th of December last,\r\nand ought to have been then transmitted with that of the 25th of April,\r\nbut by some oversight it was omitted.\r\n\r\nA.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 18, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 12th instant,\r\nI transmit a report of the Secretary of State, with the papers therein\r\nreferred to, which, with those accompanying the special message this day\r\nsent to Congress, are believed to contain all the information requested.\r\nThe papers relative to the letter of the late minister of France have\r\nbeen added to those called for, that the subject may be fully\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, January 13, 1836_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State has the honor to lay before the President a copy\r\nof a report made to him in June last, and of a letter addressed to this\r\nDepartment by the late minister of the Government of France, with the\r\ncorrespondence connected with that communication, which, together with a\r\nlate correspondence between the Secretary of State and the French chargé\r\nd'affaires and a recent correspondence between the chargé d'affaires of\r\nthe United States at Paris and the Duke de Broglie, already transmitted\r\nto the President to be communicated to Congress with his special message\r\nrelative thereto, are the only papers in the Department of State\r\nsupposed to be called for by the resolutions of the Senate of the 12th\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the correspondence with the chargé d'affaires of\r\nFrance that a dispatch to him from the Duke de Broglie was read to the\r\nSecretary at the Department in September last. It concluded with an\r\nauthority to permit a copy to be taken if it was desired. That dispatch\r\nbeing an argumentative answer to the last letter of Mr. Livingston to\r\nthe French Government, and in affirmance of the right of France to\r\nexpect explanations of the message of the President, which France\r\nhad been distinctly and timely informed could not be given without a\r\ndisregard by the Chief Magistrate of his constitutional obligations,\r\nno desire was expressed to obtain a copy, it being obviously improper\r\nto receive an argument in a form which admitted of no reply, and\r\nnecessarily unavailing to inquire how much or how little would satisfy\r\nFrance, when her right to any such explanation had been beforehand so\r\ndistinctly and formally denied.\r\n\r\nAll which is respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, June 18, 1835_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to present, for the examination of the President, three\r\nletters received at the Department from ----, dated at Paris, the 19th,\r\n23d, and 30th of April. The last two I found here on my recent return\r\nfrom Georgia. They were received on the 9th and 10th of June; the\r\nlast came to my own hand yesterday. Several communications have been\r\npreviously received from the same quarter, all of them volunteered; none\r\nof them have been acknowledged. The unsolicited communications to the\r\nDepartment by citizens of the United States of facts that may come to\r\ntheir knowledge while residing abroad, likely to be interesting to\r\ntheir country, are always received with pleasure and carefully preserved\r\non the files of the Government. Even opinions on foreign topics are\r\nreceived with proper respect for the motives and character of those\r\nwho may choose to express them.\r\n\r\nBut holding it both improper and dangerous to countenance any of\r\nour citizens occupying no public station in sending confidential\r\ncommunications on our affairs with a foreign government at which we have\r\nan accredited agent, upon subjects involving the honor of the country,\r\nwithout the knowledge of such agent, and virtually substituting himself\r\nas the channel of communication between that government and his own, I\r\nconsidered it my duty to invite Mr. Pageot to the Department to apprise\r\nhim of the contents of Mr. ----'s letter of the 23d of April, and at the\r\nsame time to inform him that he might communicate the fact to the Duke\r\nde Broglie that no notice could be taken of Mr. ---- and his\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\nThe extreme and culpable indiscretion of Mr. ---- in this transaction\r\nwas strikingly illustrated by a remark of Mr. Pageot, after a careful\r\nexamination of the letter of 23d April, that although without\r\ninstructions from his Government he would venture to assure me that\r\nthe Duke de Broglie could not have expected Mr. ---- to make such\r\na communication to the Secretary of State. Declining to enter into\r\nthe consideration of what the Duke might have expected or intended,\r\nI was satisfied with the assurances Mr. Pageot gave me that he would\r\nimmediately state what had occurred to his Government.\r\n\r\nAll which is respectfully submitted, with the hope, if the course\r\npursued is approved by the President, that this report may be filed\r\nin this Department with the letters to which it refers.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forsyth to Mr. Livingston_.\r\n\r\nNo. 50.\r\n\r\n[Extract.]\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, March 5, 1835_.\r\n\r\nEDWARD LIVINGSTON, Esq.,\r\n\r\n_Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, Paris_.\r\n\r\nSIR: In my note No. 49 you were informed that the last letter of\r\nM. Sérurier would be made the subject of separate and particular\r\ninstructions to you. Unwilling to add to the irritation produced by\r\nrecent incidents in our relations with France, the President will not\r\ntake for granted that the very exceptionable language of the French\r\nminister was used by the orders or will be countenanced by the authority\r\nof the King of France. You will therefore, as early as practicable after\r\nthis reaches you, call the attention of the minister of foreign affairs\r\nto the following passage in M. Sérurier's letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Les plaintes que porte M. le Président centre le prétendu\r\n  non-accomplissement des engagemens pris par le Gouvernement du Roi à\r\n  la suite du vote du 1er avril 1834, ne sont pas seulement étrangé par\r\n  l'entière inexactitude des allégations sur lesquelles elles reposent,\r\n  mais aussi parceque les explications qu'a reçues à Paris M. Livingston,\r\n  et celles que le soussigné a données directement an cabinet de\r\n  Washington semblaient ne pas laisser même la possibilité d'un\r\n  malentendu sur des points aussi délicats.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all discussions between government and government, whatever\r\nmay be the differences of opinion on the facts or principles brought\r\ninto view, the invariable rule of courtesy and justice demands that\r\nthe sincerity of the opposing party in the views which it entertains\r\nshould never be called in question. Facts may be denied, deductions\r\nexamined, disproved, and condemned, without just cause of offense; but\r\nno impeachment of the integrity of the Government in its reliance\r\non the correctness of its own views can be permitted without a total\r\nforgetfulness of self-respect. In the sentence quoted from M. Sérurier's\r\nletter no exception is taken to the assertion that the complaints of\r\nthis Government are founded upon allegations entirely inexact, nor upon\r\nthat which declares the explanations given here or in Paris appeared,\r\nnot to have left even the possibility of a misunderstanding on such\r\ndelicate points. The correctness of these assertions we shall always\r\ndispute, and while the records of the two Governments endure we shall\r\nfind no difficulty in shewing that they are groundless; but when M.\r\nSérurier chooses to qualify the nonaccomplishment of the engagements\r\nmade by France, to which the President refers, as a _pretended_\r\nnonaccomplishment, he conveys the idea that the Chief Magistrate knows\r\nor believes that he is in error, and acting upon this known error seeks\r\nto impose it upon Congress and the world as truth. In this sense it\r\nis a direct attack upon the integrity of the Chief Magistrate of the\r\nRepublic. As such it must be indignantly repelled; and it being a\r\nquestion of moral delinquency between the two Governments, the evidence\r\nagainst France, by whom it is raised, must be sternly arrayed. You will\r\nascertain, therefore, if it has been used by the authority or receives\r\nthe sanction of the Government of France _in that sense_. Should it\r\nbe disavowed or explained, as from the note of the Count de Rigny to\r\nyou, written at the moment of great excitement, and in its matter not\r\ndiffering from M. Sérurier's, it is presumed it will be, you will then\r\nuse the materials herewith communicated, or already in your power, in\r\na temper of great forbearance, but with a firmness of tone not to be\r\nmistaken, to answer the substance of the note itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Sérurier to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\n[Translation.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 23, 1835_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN FORSYTH,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of His\r\nMajesty the King of the French at Washington, has received orders to\r\npresent the following note to the Secretary of State of the Government\r\nof the United States:\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous to say that the message addressed on the 1st\r\nof December, 1834, to the Congress of the United States by President\r\nJackson was received at Paris with a sentiment of painful surprise.\r\n\r\nThe King's Government is far from supposing that the measures\r\nrecommended in this message to the attention of Congress can be\r\nadopted (_votées_) by that assembly; but even considering the document\r\nin question as a mere manifestation of the opinion which the President\r\nwishes to express with regard to the course taken in this affair, it is\r\nimpossible not to consider its publication as a fact of a most serious\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThe complaints brought forward by the President on account of the\r\npretended nonfulfillment of the engagements entered into by the King's\r\nGovernment after the vote of the 1st of April are strange, not only from\r\nthe total inaccuracy of the allegations on which they are based, but\r\nalso because the explanations received by Mr. Livingston at Paris and\r\nthose which the undersigned has given directly to the Cabinet of\r\nWashington seemed not to leave the slightest possibility of\r\nmisunderstanding on points so delicate.\r\n\r\nIt appeared, indeed, from these explanations that although the session\r\nof the French Chambers, which was opened on the 31st of July last in\r\ncompliance with an express provision of the charter, was prorogued at\r\nthe end of a fortnight, before the bill relative to the American claims,\r\nannounced in the discourse from the throne, could be placed under\r\ndiscussion, this prorogation arose (_tendit_) entirely from the absolute\r\nimpossibility of commencing at so premature a period the legislative\r\nlabors belonging to the year 1835.\r\n\r\nIt also appeared that the motives which had hindered the formal\r\npresentation to the Chambers of the bill in question during the first\r\nspace of a fortnight originated chiefly in the desire more effectually\r\nto secure the success of this important affair by choosing the most\r\nopportune moment of offering it to the deliberations of the deputies\r\nnewly elected, who, perhaps, might have been unfavorably impressed by\r\nthis unusual haste in submitting it to them so long before the period\r\nat which they could enter upon an examination of it.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned will add that it is, moreover, difficult to comprehend\r\nwhat advantage could have resulted from such a measure, since it could\r\nnot evidently have produced the effect which the President declares that\r\nhe had in view, of enabling him to state at the opening of Congress that\r\nthese long-pending negotiations were definitively closed. The President\r\nsupposes, it is true, that the Chambers might have been called together\r\nanew before the last month of 1834; but even though the session had been\r\nopened some months earlier--which for several reasons would have been\r\nimpossible--the simplest calculation will serve to shew that in no case\r\ncould the decision of the Chambers have been taken, much less made known\r\nat Washington, before the 1st of December.\r\n\r\nThe King's Government had a right (_devait_) to believe that\r\nconsiderations so striking would have proved convincing with the\r\nCabinet of the United States, and the more so as no direct communication\r\nmade to the undersigned by this Cabinet or transmitted at Paris by\r\nMr. Livingston had given token of the irritation and misunderstandings\r\nwhich the message of December 1 has thus deplorably revealed, and as\r\nMr. Livingston, with that judicious spirit which characterizes him,\r\ncoinciding with the system of (_ménagemens_) precautions and temporizing\r\nprudence adopted by the cabinet of the Tuileries with a view to the\r\ncommon interests, had even requested at the moment of the meeting of\r\nthe Chambers that the presentation of the bill in question might be\r\ndeferred, in order that its discussion should not be mingled with\r\ndebates of another nature, with which its coincidence might place it\r\nin jeopardy.\r\n\r\nThis last obstacle had just been removed and the bill was about to be\r\npresented to the Chamber of Deputies when the arrival of the message, by\r\ncreating in the minds of all a degree of astonishment at least equal to\r\nthe just irritation which it could not fail to produce, has forced the\r\nGovernment of the King to deliberate on the part which it had to adopt.\r\n\r\nStrong in its own right and dignity, it did not conceive that the\r\ninexplicable act of the President ought to cause it to renounce\r\nabsolutely a determination the origin of which had been its respect for\r\nengagements (_loyauté_) and its good feelings toward a friendly nation.\r\nAlthough it does not conceal from itself that the provocation given\r\nat Washington has materially increased the difficulties of the case,\r\nalready so great, yet it has determined to ask from the Chambers an\r\nappropriation of twenty-five millions to meet the engagements of the\r\ntreaty of July 4.\r\n\r\nBut His Majesty has at the same time resolved no longer to expose\r\nhis minister to hear such language as that held on December 1. The\r\nundersigned has received orders to return to France, and the dispatch\r\nof this order has been made known to Mr. Livingston.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has the honor to present to the Secretary of State the\r\nassurance of his high consideration.\r\n\r\nSÉRURIER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Livingston to the Duke de Broglie_.\r\n\r\nLEGATION OF THE UNITED STATICS OF AMERICA,\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 18, 1835_.\r\n\r\nM. LE DUC: I am specially directed to call the attention of His\r\nMajesty's Government to the following passage in the note presented\r\nby M. Sérurier to the Secretary of State at Washington:\r\n\r\n\"Les plaintes que porte Monsieur le Président centre le prétendu\r\nnon-accomplissement des engagemens pris par le Gouvernement du Roi á\r\nla suite du vote du 1er avril 1834, ne sont pas settlement étrangé par\r\nl'entière inexactitude des allégations sur lesquelles elles reposent,\r\nmais aussi parceque les explications qu'a recues á Paris M. Livingston,\r\net celles que le soussigné a donnees directement an cabinet de\r\nWashington, semblaient ne pas laisser même la possibilité d'un\r\nmalentendu sur des points aussi délicats.\"\r\n\r\nEach party in a discussion of this nature has an uncontested right to\r\nmake its own statement of facts and draw its own conclusions from them,\r\nto acknowledge or deny the accuracy of counter proof or the force of\r\nobjecting arguments, with no other restraints than those which respect\r\nfor his own convictions, the opinion of the world, and the rules of\r\ncommon courtesy impose. This freedom of argument is essential to the\r\ndiscussion of all national concerns, and can not be objected to without\r\nshowing an improper and irritating susceptibility. It is for this reason\r\nthat the Government of the United States make no complaint of the\r\nassertion in the note presented by M. Sérurier that the statement of\r\nfacts contained in the President's message is inaccurate, and that\r\nthe causes assigned for the delay in presenting the law ought to\r\nhave satisfied them. On their part they contest the facts, deny the\r\naccuracy of the conclusions, and appeal to the record, to reason, and\r\nto the sense of justice of His Majesty's Government on a more mature\r\nconsideration of the case for their justification. But I am further\r\ninstructed to say that there is one expression in the passage I have\r\nquoted which in one signification could not be admitted even within the\r\nbroad limits which are allowed to discussions of this nature, and which,\r\ntherefore, the President will not believe to have been used in the\r\noffensive sense that might be attributed to it. The word \"_pretendu_\"\r\nsometimes, it is believed, in French, and its translation always in\r\nEnglish, implies not only that the assertion which it qualifies is\r\nuntrue, but that the party making it knows it to be so and uses it\r\nfor the purposes of deception.\r\n\r\nAlthough the President can not believe that the term was employed in\r\nthis injurious sense, yet the bare possibility of a construction being\r\nput upon it which it would be incumbent on him to repel with indignation\r\nobliges him to ask for the necessary explanation.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, etc.,\r\n\r\nEDWARD LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Livingston to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\n[Extract.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 29, 1835_.\r\n\r\n... Having received my passports, I left Paris on the 29th of April.\r\nAt the time of my departure the note, of which a copy has been\r\ntransmitted to you, asking an explanation of the terms used in M.\r\nSérurier's communication to the Department, remained unanswered, but I\r\nhave reason to believe that the answer when given will be satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 20, 1836_.\r\n\r\nHon. JAMES K. POLK,\r\n\r\n_Speaker of the House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I herewith transmit to the House of Representatives a report from\r\nthe Director of the Mint, exhibiting the operations of that institution\r\nduring the year 1835.\r\n\r\nThe report contains also some very useful suggestions as to certain\r\nchanges in the laws connected with our coinage and with that\r\nestablishment, which are recommended to your early and careful\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nBesides some remarks in it on the progress made in the erection of\r\nbranch mints and procuring machinery therefor, I inclose a report from\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, submitting more detailed statements as to\r\nthe new buildings from each of the agents appointed to superintend their\r\nerection.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 8, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe Government of Great Britain has offered its mediation for the\r\nadjustment of the dispute between the United States and France.\r\nCarefully guarding that point in the controversy which, as it involves\r\nour honor and independence, admits of no compromise, I have cheerfully\r\naccepted the offer. It will be obviously improper to resort even to the\r\nmildest measures of a compulsory character until it is ascertained\r\nwhether France has declined or accepted the mediation. I therefore\r\nrecommend a suspension of all proceedings on that part of my special\r\nmessage of the 15th of January last which proposes a partial\r\nnonintercourse with France. While we can not too highly appreciate the\r\nelevated and disinterested motives of the offer of Great Britain, and\r\nhave a just reliance upon the great influence of that power to restore\r\nthe relations of ancient friendship between the United States and\r\nFrance, and know, too, that our own pacific policy will be strictly\r\nadhered to until the national honor compels us to depart from it, we\r\nshould be insensible to the exposed condition of our country and forget\r\nthe lessons of experience if we did not efficiently and sedulously\r\nprepare for an adverse result. The peace of a nation does not depend\r\nexclusively upon its own will, nor upon the beneficent policy of\r\nneighboring powers; and that nation which is found totally unprepared\r\nfor the exigencies and dangers of war, although it come without having\r\ngiven warning of its approach, is criminally negligent of its honor and\r\nits duty. I can not too strongly repeat the recommendation already made\r\nto place the seaboard in a proper state for defense and promptly to\r\nprovide the means for amply protecting our commerce.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 9, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the call made by the Senate in their resolution of the\r\n3d instant, relative to the Indian hostilities in Florida, I transmit\r\nherewith a report from the Secretary of War, accompanied by sundry\r\nexplanatory papers.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 10, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of War, with copies of\r\nso much of the correspondence relating to Indian affairs called for by\r\nthe resolution of the House of January 23, 1835, as can be furnished by\r\nthat Department. I also transmit a report on the same subject from the\r\nTreasury Department, from which it appears that without a special\r\nappropriation or the suspension for a considerable period of much\r\nof the urgent and current business of the General Land Office it\r\nis impracticable to take copies of all the papers described in the\r\nresolution. Under these circumstances the subject is again respectfully\r\nsubmitted to the consideration of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 11, 1836.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return to the Senate the resolution of the legislature of the\r\nState of Indiana requesting the President to suspend from sale a strip\r\nof land 10 miles in width, on a line from Munceytown to Fort Wayne,\r\nwhich resolution was referred to me on the 5th instant.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the memorial to which the resolution is subjoined that\r\nthe lands embraced therein have been in market for several years past;\r\nthat the legislature of the State of Indiana have applied to Congress\r\nfor the passage of a law giving that State the right to purchase at such\r\nreduced prices as Congress may fix, and that their suspension from sale\r\nis requested as auxiliary to this application.\r\n\r\nBy the acts of Congress now in force all persons who may choose to make\r\nentries for these lands in the manner prescribed by law are entitled to\r\npurchase the same, and as the President possesses no dispensing power it\r\nwill be obvious to the Senate that until authorized by law he can not\r\nrightfully act on the subject referred to him.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 15, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, in pursuance of the resolutions passed by\r\nthat body on the 3d instant, a report from the Secretary of State,\r\naccompanied by certain papers, relative to the existing relations\r\nbetween the United States and France.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 18, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives, in answer to their\r\nresolutions of the ---- February instant, reports from the Secretary of\r\nState and the Secretary of the Treasury, with accompanying documents,\r\nrelating to the relations between the United States and France. For\r\nreasons adverted to by the Secretary of State, the resolutions of the\r\nHouse have not been more fully complied with.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 22, 1836.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to Congress copies of the correspondence between the\r\nSecretary of State and the chargé d'affaires of His Britannic Majesty,\r\nrelative to the mediation of Great Britain in our disagreement with\r\nFrance and to the determination of the French Government to execute the\r\ntreaty of indemnification without further delay on the application for\r\npayment by the agent of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe grounds upon which the mediation was accepted will be found fully\r\ndeveloped in the correspondence. On the part of France the mediation had\r\nbeen publicly accepted before the offer of it could be received here.\r\nWhilst each of the two Governments has thus discovered a just solicitude\r\nto resort to all honorable means of adjusting amicably the controversy\r\nbetween them, it is a matter of congratulation that the mediation has\r\nbeen rendered unnecessary. Under such circumstances the anticipation may\r\nbe confidently indulged that the disagreement between the United States\r\nand France will not have produced more than a temporary estrangement.\r\nThe healing effects of time, a just consideration of the powerful\r\nmotives for a cordial good understanding between the two nations, the\r\nstrong inducements each has to respect and esteem the other, will no\r\ndoubt soon obliterate from their remembrance all traces of that\r\ndisagreement.\r\n\r\nOf the elevated and disinterested part the Government of Great Britain\r\nhas acted and was prepared to act I have already had occasion to express\r\nmy high sense. Universal respect and the consciousness of meriting\r\nit are with Governments as with men the just rewards of those who\r\nfaithfully exert their power to preserve peace, restore harmony, and\r\nperpetuate good will.\r\n\r\nI may be permitted, I trust, at this time, without a suspicion of the\r\nmost remote desire to throw off censure from the Executive or to point\r\nit to any other department or branch of the Government, to refer to the\r\nwant of effective preparation in which our country was found at the\r\nlate crisis. From the nature of our institutions the movements of the\r\nGovernment in preparation for hostilities must ever be too slow for the\r\nexigencies of unexpected war. I submit it, then, to you whether the\r\nfirst duty we owe to the people who have confided to us their power is\r\nnot to place our country in such an attitude as always to be so amply\r\nsupplied with the means of self-defense as to afford no inducements to\r\nother nations to presume upon our forbearance or to expect important\r\nadvantages from a sudden assault, either upon our commerce, our\r\nseacoast, or our interior frontier. In case of the commencement of\r\nhostilities during the recess of Congress, the time inevitably elapsing\r\nbefore that body could be called together, even under the most favorable\r\ncircumstances, would be pregnant with danger; and if we escaped without\r\nsignal disaster or national dishonor, the hazard of both unnecessarily\r\nincurred could not fail to excite a feeling of deep reproach. I\r\nearnestly recommend to you, therefore, to make such provisions that\r\nin no future time shall we be found without ample means to repel\r\naggression, even although it may come upon us without a note of warning.\r\nWe are now, fortunately, so situated that the expenditure for this\r\npurpose will not be felt, and if it were it would be approved by those\r\nfrom whom all its means are derived, and for whose benefit only it\r\nshould be used with a liberal economy and an enlightened forecast.\r\n\r\nIn behalf of these suggestions I can not forbear repeating the wise\r\nprecepts of one whose counsels can not be forgotten:\r\n\r\n\r\n  ... The United States ought not to indulge a persuasion that, contrary\r\n  to the order of human events, they will forever keep at a distance\r\n  those painful appeals to arms with which the history of every other\r\n  nation abounds. There is a rank due to the United States among nations\r\n  which will be withheld, if not absolutely lost, by the reputation of\r\n  weakness. If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it;\r\n  if we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerful instruments of\r\n  our rising prosperity, it must be known that we are at all times ready\r\n  for war.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 27, 1836_.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, His Britannic Majesty's chargé d'affaires, has been\r\ninstructed to state to Mr. Forsyth, the Secretary of State of the United\r\nStates, that the British Government has witnessed with the greatest pain\r\nand regret the progress of the misunderstanding which has lately grown\r\nup between the Governments of France and of the United States. The first\r\nobject of the undeviating policy of the British cabinet has been to\r\nmaintain uninterrupted the relations of peace between Great Britain and\r\nthe other nations of the world, without any abandonment of national\r\ninterests and without any sacrifice of national honor. The next object\r\nto which their anxious and unremitting exertions have been directed has\r\nbeen by an appropriate exercise of the good offices and moral influence\r\nof Great Britain to heal dissensions which may have arisen among\r\nneighboring powers and to preserve for other nations those blessings of\r\npeace which Great Britain is so desirous of securing for herself.\r\n\r\nThe steady efforts of His Majesty's Government have hitherto been,\r\nfortunately, successful in the accomplishment of both these ends, and\r\nwhile Europe during the last five years has passed through a crisis of\r\nextraordinary hazard without any disturbance of the general peace, His\r\nMajesty's Government has the satisfaction of thinking that it has on\r\nmore than one occasion been instrumental in reconciling differences\r\nwhich might otherwise have led to quarrels, and in cementing union\r\nbetween friendly powers.\r\n\r\nBut if ever there could be an occasion on which it would be painful to\r\nthe British Government to see the relations of amity broken off between\r\ntwo friendly states that occasion is undoubtedly the present, when a\r\nrupture is apprehended between two great powers, with both of which\r\nGreat Britain is united by the closest ties--with one of which she is\r\nengaged in active alliance; with the other of which she is joined by\r\ncommunity of interests and by the bonds of kindred.\r\n\r\nNor would the grounds of difference on the present occasion reconcile\r\nthe friends and wellwishers of the differing parties to the misfortune\r\nof an open rupture between them.\r\n\r\nWhen the conflicting interests of two nations are so opposed on a\r\nparticular question as to admit of no possible compromise, the sword may\r\nbe required to cut the knot which reason is unable to untie.\r\n\r\nWhen passions have been so excited on both sides that no common standard\r\nof justice can be found, and what one party insists on as a right the\r\nother denounces as a wrong, prejudice may become too headstrong to yield\r\nto the voice of equity, and those who can agree on nothing else may\r\nconsent to abide the fate of arms and to allow that the party which\r\nshall prove the weakest in the war shall be deemed to have been wrong\r\nin the dispute.\r\n\r\nBut in the present case there is no question of national interest at\r\nissue between France and the United States. In the present case there\r\nis no demand of justice made by one party and denied by the other.\r\nThe disputed claims of America on France, which were founded upon\r\ntransactions in the early part of the present century and were for many\r\nyears in litigation, have at length been established by mutual consent\r\nand are admitted by a treaty concluded between the two Governments.\r\nThe money due by France has been provided by the Chambers, and has been\r\nplaced at the disposal of the French Government for the purpose of being\r\npaid to the United States. But questions have arisen between the two\r\nGovernments in the progress of those transactions affecting on both\r\nsides the feelings of national honor, and it is on this ground that the\r\nrelations between the parties have been for the moment suspended and are\r\nin danger of being more seriously interrupted.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things the British Government is led to think that the\r\ngood offices of a third power equally the friend of France and of the\r\nUnited States, and prompted by considerations of the highest order most\r\nearnestly to wish for the continuance of peace, might be useful in\r\nrestoring a good understanding between the two parties on a footing\r\nconsistent with the nicest feelings of national honor in both.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has therefore been instructed by His Majesty's\r\nGovernment formally to tender to the Government of the United States the\r\nmediation of Great Britain for the settlement of the differences between\r\nthe United States and France, and to say that a note precisely similar\r\nto the present has been delivered to the French Government by His\r\nMajesty's ambassador at Paris. The undersigned has, at the same time,\r\nto express the confident hope of His Majesty's Government that if the two\r\nparties would agree to refer to the British Government the settlement of\r\nthe point at issue between them, and to abide by the opinion which that\r\nGovernment might after due consideration communicate to the two parties\r\nthereupon, means might be found of satisfying the honor of each without\r\nincurring those great and manifold evils which a rupture between two\r\nsuch powers must inevitably entail on both.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has the honor to renew to Mr. Forsyth the assurance of\r\nhis most distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nCHARLES BANKHEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 3, 1836_.\r\n\r\nCHARLES BANKHEAD, Esq.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Secretary of State of the United States, has had the\r\nhonor to receive the note of the 27th ultimo of Mr. Charles Bankhead,\r\nHis Britannic Majesty's chargé d'affaires, offering to the Government of\r\nthe United States the mediation of His Britannic Majesty's Government\r\nfor the settlement of the differences unhappily existing between the\r\nUnited States and France. That communication having been submitted\r\nto the President, and considered with all the care belonging to the\r\nimportance of the subject and the source from which it emanated,\r\nthe undersigned has been instructed to assure Mr. Bankhead that the\r\ndisinterested and honorable motives which have dictated the proposal are\r\nfully appreciated. The pacific policy of His Britannic Majesty's cabinet\r\nand their efforts to heal dissensions arising among nations are worthy\r\nof the character and commanding influence of Great Britain, and the\r\nsuccess of those efforts is as honorable to the Government by whose\r\ninstrumentality it was secured as it has been beneficial to the parties\r\nmore immediately interested and to the world at large.\r\n\r\nThe sentiments upon which this policy is founded, and which are so\r\nforcibly displayed in the offer that has been made, are deeply impressed\r\nupon the mind of the President. They are congenial with the institutions\r\nand principles as well as with the interests and habits of the people of\r\nthe United States, and it has been the constant aim of their Government\r\nin its conduct toward other powers to observe and illustrate them.\r\nCordially approving the general views of His Britannic Majesty's\r\nGovernment, the President regards with peculiar satisfaction the\r\nenlightened and disinterested solicitude manifested by it for the\r\nwelfare of the nations to whom its good offices are now tendered, and\r\nhas seen with great sensibility, in the exhibition of that feeling, the\r\nrecognition of that community of interests and those ties of kindred by\r\nwhich the United States and Great Britain are united.\r\n\r\nIf circumstances did not render it certain, it would have been obvious\r\nfrom the language of Mr. Bankhead's note to the undersigned that the\r\nGovernment of His Britannic Majesty, when the instructions under which\r\nit was prepared were given, could not have been apprised of all the\r\nsteps taken in the controversy between the United States and France.\r\nIt was necessarily ignorant of the tenor of the two recent messages of\r\nthe President to Congress--the first communicated at the commencement of\r\nthe present session, under date of the 7th of December, 1835, and the\r\nsecond under that of the 15th of January, 1836. Could these documents\r\nhave been within the knowledge of His Britannic Majesty's Government,\r\nthe President does not doubt that it would have been fully satisfied\r\nthat the disposition of the United States, notwithstanding their\r\nwell-grounded and serious causes of complaint against France, to\r\nrestore friendly relations and cultivate a good understanding with the\r\nGovernment of that country was undiminished, and that all had already\r\nbeen done on their part that could in reason be expected of them to\r\nsecure that result. The first of these documents, although it gave such\r\na history of the origin and progress of the claims of the United States\r\nand of the proceedings of France before and since the treaty of 1831\r\nas to vindicate the statements and recommendations of the message of\r\nthe 1st of December, 1834, yet expressly disclaimed the offensive\r\ninterpretation put upon it by the Government of France, and while\r\nit insisted on the acknowledged rights of the United States and the\r\nobligations of the treaty and maintained the honor and independence\r\nof the American Government, evinced an anxious desire to do all that\r\nconstitutional duty and strict justice would permit to remove every\r\ncause of irritation and excitement. The special message of the 15th\r\nJanuary last being called for by the extraordinary and inadmissible\r\ndemands of the Government of France as defined in the last official\r\ncommunications at Paris, and by the continued refusal of France to\r\nexecute a treaty from the faithful performance of which by the United\r\nStates it was tranquilly enjoying important advantages, it became the\r\nduty of the President to recommend such measures as might be adapted\r\nto the exigencies of the occasion. Unwilling to believe that a nation\r\ndistinguished for honor and intelligence could have determined\r\npermanently to maintain a ground so indefensible, and anxious still to\r\nleave open the door of reconciliation, the President contented himself\r\nwith proposing to Congress the mildest of the remedies given by the law\r\nand practice of nations in connection with such propositions for defense\r\nas were evidently required by the condition of the United States and\r\nthe attitude assumed by France. In all these proceedings, as well as\r\nin every stage of these difficulties with France, it is confidently\r\nbelieved that the course of the United States, when duly considered\r\nby other Governments and the world, will be found to have been marked\r\nnot only by a pacific disposition, but by a spirit of forbearance and\r\nconciliation.\r\n\r\nFor a further illustration of this point, as well as for the purpose of\r\npresenting a lucid view of the whole subject, the undersigned has the\r\nhonor to transmit to Mr. Bankhead copies of all that part of the message\r\nof December 7, 1835, which relates to it and of the correspondence\r\nreferred to therein, and also copies of the message and accompanying\r\ndocuments of the 15th of January, 1836, and of another message of the\r\n18th of the same month, transmitting a report of the Secretary of State\r\nand certain documents connected with the subject.\r\n\r\nThese papers, while they will bring down the history of the\r\nmisunderstanding between the United States and France to the present\r\ndate, will also remove an erroneous impression which appears to be\r\nentertained by His Britannic Majesty's Government. It is suggested in\r\nMr. Bankhead's note that there is no question of national interest\r\nat issue between France and the United States, and that there is no\r\ndemand of justice made by the one party and denied by the other. This\r\nsuggestion appears to be founded on the facts that the claims of the\r\nUnited States have been admitted by a treaty concluded between the two\r\nGovernments and that the money due by France has been provided by the\r\nChambers and placed at the disposal of the French Government for the\r\npurpose of being paid to the United States. But it is to be observed\r\nthat the payment of the money thus appropriated is refused by the French\r\nGovernment unless the United States will first comply with a condition\r\nnot contained in the treaty and not assented to by them. This refusal to\r\nmake payment is, in the view of the United States, a denial of justice,\r\nand has not only been accompanied by acts and language of which they\r\nhave great reason to complain, but the delay of payment is highly\r\ninjurious to those American citizens who are entitled to share in the\r\nindemnification provided by the treaty and to the interests of the\r\nUnited States, inasmuch as the reduction of the duties levied on French\r\nwines in pursuance of that treaty has diminished the public revenue,\r\nand has been and yet is enjoyed by France, with all the other benefits\r\nof the treaty, without the consideration and equivalents for which\r\nthey were granted. But there are other national interests, and, in the\r\njudgment of this Government, national interests of the highest order,\r\ninvolved in the condition prescribed and insisted on by France which\r\nit has been by the President made the duty of the undersigned to bring\r\ndistinctly into view. That condition proceeds on the assumption that a\r\nforeign power whose acts are spoken of by the President of the United\r\nStates in a message to Congress, transmitted in obedience to his\r\nconstitutional duties, and which deems itself aggrieved by the language\r\nthus held by him, may as a matter of right require from the Government\r\nof the United States a direct official explanation of such language,\r\nto be given in such form and expressed in such terms as shall meet the\r\nrequirements and satisfy the feelings of the offended party, and may\r\nin default of such explanation annul or suspend a solemn treaty duly\r\nexecuted by its constitutional organ. Whatever may be the responsibility\r\nof those nations whose executives possess the power of declaring war\r\nand of adopting other coercive remedies without the intervention of\r\nthe legislative department, for the language held by the Executive in\r\naddressing that department, it is obvious that under the Constitution\r\nof the United States, which gives to the Executive no such powers, but\r\nvests them exclusively in the Legislature, whilst at the same time it\r\nimposes on the Executive the duty of laying before the Legislature the\r\nstate of the nation, with such recommendations as he may deem proper,\r\nno such responsibility can be admitted without impairing that freedom\r\nof intercommunication which is essential to the system and without\r\nsurrendering in this important particular the right of self-government.\r\nIn accordance with this view of the Federal Constitution has been the\r\npractice under it. The statements and recommendations of the President\r\nto Congress are regarded by this Government as a part of the purely\r\ndomestic consultations held by its different departments--consultations\r\nin which nothing is addressed to foreign powers, and in which they can\r\nnot be permitted to interfere, and for which, until consummated and\r\ncarried out by acts emanating from the proper constitutional organs,\r\nthe nation is not responsible and the Government not liable to account\r\nto other States.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the accompanying correspondence that when the\r\ncondition referred to was first proposed in the Chamber of Deputies the\r\ninsuperable objections to it were fully communicated by the American\r\nminister at Paris to the French Government, and that he distinctly\r\ninformed it that the condition, if prescribed, could never be complied\r\nwith. The views expressed by him were approved by the President, and\r\nhave been since twice asserted and enforced by him in his messages to\r\nCongress in terms proportioned in their explicitness and solemnity to\r\nthe conviction he entertains of the importance and inviolability of the\r\nprinciple involved.\r\n\r\nThe United States can not yield this principle, nor can they do or\r\nconsent to any measure by which its influence in the action of their\r\npolitical system can be obstructed or diminished. Under these\r\ncircumstances the President feels that he may rely on the intelligence\r\nand liberality of His Britannic Majesty's Government for a correct\r\nestimation of the imperative obligations which leave him no power to\r\nsubject this point to the control of any foreign state, whatever may be\r\nhis confidence in its justice and impartiality--a confidence which he\r\nhas taken pleasure in instructing the undersigned to state is fully\r\nreposed by him in the Government of His Britannic Majesty.\r\n\r\nSo great, however, is the desire of the President for the restoration of\r\na good understanding with the Government of France, provided it can be\r\neffected on terms compatible with the honor and independence of the\r\nUnited States, that if, after the frank avowal of his sentiments upon\r\nthe point last referred to and the explicit reservation of that point,\r\nthe Government of His Britannic Majesty shall believe that its mediation\r\ncan be useful in adjusting the differences which exist between the two\r\ncountries and in restoring all their relations to a friendly footing, he\r\ninstructs the undersigned to inform Mr. Bankhead that in such case the\r\noffer of mediation made in his note is cheerfully accepted.\r\n\r\nThe United States desire nothing but equal and exact justice, and they\r\ncan not but hope that the good offices of a third power, friendly to\r\nboth parties, and prompted by the elevated considerations manifested\r\nin Mr. Bankhead's note, may promote the attainment of this end.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by these motives, the President will cordially cooperate,\r\nso far as his constitutional powers may enable him, in such steps as\r\nmay be requisite on the part of the United States to give effect to the\r\nproposed mediation. He trusts that no unnecessary delay will be allowed\r\nto occur, and instructs the undersigned to request that the earliest\r\ninformation of the measures taken by Great Britain and of their result\r\nmay be communicated to this Government.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned avails himself of the occasion to renew to Mr. Bankhead\r\nthe assurances of his distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 15, 1836_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN FORSYTH, etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, His Britannic Majesty's chargé d'affaires, with\r\nreference to his note of the 27th of last month, has the honor to inform\r\nMr. Forsyth, Secretary of State of the United States, that he has been\r\ninstructed by his Government to state that the British Government has\r\nreceived a communication from that of France which fulfills the wishes\r\nthat impelled His Britannic Majesty to offer his mediation for the\r\npurpose of effecting an amicable adjustment of the difference between\r\nFrance and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe French Government has stated to that of His Majesty that the frank\r\nand honorable manner in which the President has in his recent message\r\nexpressed himself with regard to the points of difference between the\r\nGovernments of France and of the United States has removed those\r\ndifficulties, upon the score of national honor, which have hitherto\r\nstood in the way of the prompt execution by France of the treaty of the\r\n4th July, 1831, and that consequently the French Government is now ready\r\nto pay the installment which is due on account of the American indemnity\r\nwhenever the payment of that installment shall be claimed by the\r\nGovernment of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe French Government has also stated that it made this communication\r\nto that of Great Britain not regarding the British Government as a\r\nformal mediator, since its offer of mediation had then reached only the\r\nGovernment of France, by which it had been accepted, but looking upon\r\nthe British Government as a common friend of the two parties, and\r\ntherefore as a natural channel of communication between them.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned is further instructed to express the sincere pleasure\r\nwhich is felt by the British Government at the prospect thus afforded of\r\nan amicable termination of a difference which has produced a temporary\r\nestrangement between two nations who have so many interests in common,\r\nand who are so entitled to the friendship and esteem of each other; and\r\nthe undersigned has also to assure Mr. Forsyth that it has afforded the\r\nBritish Government the most lively satisfaction to have been upon this\r\noccasion the channel of a communication which they trust will lead to\r\nthe complete restoration of friendly relations between the United States\r\nand France.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has great pleasure in renewing to Mr. Forsyth the\r\nassurances of his most distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nCHARLES BANKHEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 16, 1836_.\r\n\r\nCHARLES BANKHEAD, Esq.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Secretary of State of the United States, has had the\r\nhonor to receive Mr. Bankhead's note of the 15th instant, in which he\r\nstates by the instructions of his Government that the British Government\r\nhave received a communication from that of France which fulfills the\r\nwishes that impelled His Britannic Majesty to offer his mediation for\r\nthe purpose of effecting an amicable adjustment of the differences\r\nbetween France and the United States; that the French Government, being\r\nsatisfied with the frank and honorable manner in which the President has\r\nin his recent message expressed himself in regard to the points of\r\ndifference between the two Governments, is ready to pay the installment\r\ndue on account of the American indemnity whenever it shall be claimed by\r\nthe Government of the United States, and that this communication is made\r\nto the Government of Great Britain not as a formal mediator, but as a\r\ncommon friend of both parties.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has submitted this note of His Britannic Majesty's\r\nchargé d'affaires to the President, and is instructed to reply that the\r\nPresident has received this information with the highest satisfaction--a\r\nsatisfaction as sincere as was his regret at the unexpected occurrence\r\nof the difficulty created by the erroneous impressions heretofore made\r\nupon the national sensibility of France. By the fulfillment of the\r\nobligations of the convention between the two Governments the great\r\ncause of difference will be removed, and the President anticipates\r\nthat the benevolent and magnanimous wishes of His Britannic Majesty's\r\nGovernment will be speedily realized, as the temporary estrangement\r\nbetween the two nations who have so many common interests will no doubt\r\nbe followed by the restoration of their ancient ties of friendship and\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\nThe President has further instructed the undersigned to express to His\r\nBritannic Majesty's Government his sensibility at the anxious desire\r\nit has displayed to preserve the relations of peace between the United\r\nStates and France, and the exertions it was prepared to make to\r\neffectuate that object, so essential to the prosperity and congenial\r\nto the wishes of the two nations and to the repose of the world.\r\n\r\nLeaving His Majesty's Government to the consciousness of the elevated\r\nmotives which have governed its conduct and to the universal respect\r\nwhich must be secured to it, the President is satisfied that no\r\nexpressions, however strong, of his own feelings can be appropriately\r\nused which could add to the gratification afforded to His Majesty's\r\nGovernment at being the channel of communication to preserve peace and\r\nrestore good will between differing nations, each of whom is its friend.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned avails himself of this occasion to renew to Mr. Bankhead\r\nthe assurance of his distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 23, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of War, on the progress\r\nof the improvement of Red River, furnishing information in addition to\r\nthat communicated with my message at the opening of the present session\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[The same letter was addressed to the Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 25, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a report[15] from the Secretary of State,\r\ncomplying as far as practicable with their resolution of the 16th\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Relating to claims for spoliations under the French treaty\r\nof 1831.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 29, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report of the Secretary of State, communicating an\r\napplication from the chargé d'affaires of Portugal for the passage by\r\nCongress of a special act abolishing discriminating duties upon the\r\ncargoes of Portuguese vessels imported into the United States from those\r\nparts of the dominions of Portugal in which no discriminating duties\r\nare charged upon the vessels of the United States or their cargoes, and\r\nproviding for a return of the discriminating duties which have been\r\nexacted upon the cargoes of Portuguese vessels thus circumstanced since\r\nthe 18th of April, 1834. I also transmit a copy of the correspondence\r\nwhich has taken place upon the subject between the Department of State\r\nand the chargé d'affaires of Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe whole matter is submitted to the discretion of Congress, with this\r\nsuggestion, that if an act should be passed placing the cargoes of\r\nPortuguese vessels coming from certain parts of the territories of\r\nPortugal on the footing of those imported in vessels of the United\r\nStates, in deciding upon the propriety of restoring the duties\r\nheretofore levied and the time to which they should be restored regard\r\nshould be had to the fact that the decree of the 18th April, 1834, which\r\nis made the basis of the present application, took effect in the islands\r\nof Madeira and the Azores many months after its promulgation, and to the\r\nmore important fact that until the 1st of February instant an indirect\r\nadvantage was allowed in Portugal to importations from Great Britain\r\nover those from other countries, including the United States.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_February 27, 1836_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Secretary of State, has the honor to report to the\r\nPresident that official information was received at this Department some\r\ntime since from the chargé d'affaires of Portugal of the abolition of\r\nall discriminating duties upon the cargoes of foreign vessels, including\r\nthose of the United States, imported into Lisbon and Oporto, by a decree\r\nof the Portuguese Government promulgated on the 18th of April, 1834,\r\nthe operation of which decree was stated by the chargé to extend to the\r\nisland of Madeira. Upon the strength of this decree he applied, by order\r\nof his Government, for the suspension, under the fourth section of the\r\nact of Congress of January 7, 1824, of discriminating duties upon the\r\ncargoes of Portuguese vessels imported into the United States; but\r\nbeing informed that the act alluded to was inapplicable by reason that\r\ndiscriminating duties upon the cargoes of American vessels still existed\r\nin a part of the dominions of Portugal, he has requested that the\r\nprinciple acted upon in regard to Holland may be extended to Portugal,\r\nand that discriminating duties may be abolished in respect to Portugal\r\nproper, the Madeira Islands, the Azores, and such other parts of the\r\nPortuguese dominions wherein no discriminating duty is levied upon\r\nthe vessels of the United States or their cargoes. This request is\r\naccompanied by a suggestion that unless some such reciprocity is\r\nestablished the benefits of the decree of April, 1834, will be withdrawn\r\nso far as respects this country. Application is also made for a return\r\nof the discriminating duties which have been collected since the\r\npromulgation of the said decree from the vessels of Portugal arriving\r\nin the United States from any of the ports embraced by that decree.\r\nIn reference to this point it is proper to state that it does not appear\r\nthat the force or operation of the decree referred to of the 18th April,\r\n1834, was extended by any official act of the Portuguese Government to\r\nthe islands of Madeira or the Azores until February or April, 1835.\r\nIt is also to be observed that, notwithstanding the abolition by that\r\ndecree of discriminating duties upon the importation of goods into\r\nPortugal from foreign countries, an exemption existed until the 1st of\r\nFebruary instant, according to information received from our chargé\r\nd'affaires at Lisbon, in favor of various articles when imported from\r\nGreat Britain, from an excise duty which was exacted upon the same\r\narticles when imported from other foreign countries or produced or\r\nmanufactured at home. This exemption was granted in pursuance of the\r\nconstruction given to a stipulation contained in the late treaty\r\nbetween Portugal and Great Britain, and ceased, together with that\r\ntreaty, on the 1st day of the present month.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has the honor to transmit with this report a copy of the\r\ncorrespondence between the Department and the chargé d'affaires of\r\nPortugal upon which it is founded.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 29, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, correcting an\r\nerror made in the report recently communicated to the Senate in answer\r\nto the resolution of the 16th instant, respecting the number and amount\r\nof claims for spoliations presented to the commissioners under the\r\nFrench treaty of 1831 which were rejected.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 5, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI submit to the Senate, for their advice and consent as to the\r\nratification of the same, the treaty and the supplement to it recently\r\nconcluded with the Cherokee Indians.\r\n\r\nThe papers referred to in the accompanying communication from the\r\nSecretary of War as necessary to a full view of the whole subject are\r\nalso herewith submitted.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 7, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for their consideration with a view to its\r\nratification, a treaty of peace, amity, navigation, and commerce between\r\nthe United States and the Republic of Venezuela, concluded and signed by\r\ntheir plenipotentiaries at the city of Caracas on the 20th of January\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 10, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, communicating\r\nthe proceedings of a convention assembled at Little Rock, in the\r\nTerritory of Arkansas, for the purpose of forming a constitution and\r\nsystem of government for the State of Arkansas.

There is no limitation upon the amount of these debts, though\r\nit is obvious from these instructions that the commissioner should have\r\nlimited the amount to be applied to this object; otherwise the whole\r\nfund might be exhausted and the Indians left without the means of\r\nliving. I therefore recommend either that the Senate limit the amount\r\nat their discretion or that they provide by resolution that the whole\r\npurchase money be paid to the Indians, leaving to them the adjustment\r\nof their debts.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 21, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith two treaties concluded with bands of Pottawatamies\r\nin the State of Indiana, with accompanying papers, for the consideration\r\nand action of the Senate.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 26, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, in conformity with a resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 21st instant, a report of the Secretary of War,\r\ncontaining the information called for on the subject of the causes of\r\nthe hostilities of the Seminoles and the measures taken to repress them.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 27, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn further compliance with so much of the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 21st instant as calls for an account of the\r\ncauses of the hostilities of the Seminole Indians, I transmit a\r\nsupplementary report from the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 28, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration and action of the Senate,\r\na treaty concluded on the 24th instant with the Chippewa Indians of\r\nSaganaw.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 31, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the response of Samuel Gwin, esq.,[18] to the charges\r\naffecting his official conduct and character which were set forth in the\r\nevidence taken under the authority of the Senate by the Committee on\r\nPublic Lands, and which was referred to the President by the resolution\r\nof the Senate bearing date the 3d day of March, 1835. This resolution\r\nand the evidence it refers to were officially communicated to Mr. Gwin\r\nby the Secretary of the Treasury, and the response of Mr. Gwin has been\r\nreceived through the same official channel.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Register of the land office for the northwestern district\r\nof Mississippi.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 1, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate a communication which has been\r\nreceived from Mr. B.F.

The power of Congress to fix by law a day for the regular\r\nannual meeting of Congress is undoubted, but the concluding part of\r\nthis act, which is intended to fix the adjournment of every succeeding\r\nCongress to the second Monday in May after the commencement of the first\r\nsession, does not appear to me in accordance with the provisions of the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides, Article I, section 5, that--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Neither House, during the session of Congress, shall, without the\r\n  consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any\r\n  other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle I, section 7, that--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate\r\n  and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of\r\n  adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States,\r\n  and before the same shall take effect shall be approved by him. ...\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle II, section 3, that--\r\n\r\n\r\n  He [the President] may, on extraordinary occasions convene both Houses,\r\n  or either of them, and in case of disagreement between them with respect\r\n  to the time of adjournment he may adjourn them to such time as he shall\r\n  think proper. ...\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to these provisions the day of the adjournment of Congress\r\nis not the subject of legislative enactment. Except in the event of\r\ndisagreement between the Senate and House of Representatives, the\r\nPresident has no right to meddle with the question, and in that event\r\nhis power is exclusive, but confined to fixing the adjournment of the\r\nCongress whose branches have disagreed. The question of adjournment is\r\nobviously to be decided by each Congress for itself, by the separate\r\naction of each House for the time being, and is one of those subjects\r\nupon which the framers of that instrument did not intend one Congress\r\nshould act, with or without the Executive aid, for its successors.\r\nAs a substitute for the present rule, which requires the two Houses by\r\nconsent to fix the day of adjournment, and in the event of disagreement\r\nthe President to decide, it is proposed to fix a day by law to be\r\nbinding in all future time unless changed by consent of both Houses of\r\nCongress, and to take away the contingent power of the Executive which\r\nin anticipated cases of disagreement is vested in him. This substitute\r\nis to apply, not to the present Congress and Executive, but to our\r\nsuccessors. Considering, therefore, that this subject exclusively\r\nbelongs to the two Houses of Congress whose day of adjournment is to be\r\nfixed, and that each has at that time the right to maintain and insist\r\nupon its own opinion, and to require the President to decide in the\r\nevent of disagreement with the other, I am constrained to deny my\r\nsanction to the act herewith respectfully returned to the Senate.\r\nI do so with greater reluctance as, apart from this constitutional\r\ndifficulty, the other provisions of it do not appear to me\r\nobjectionable.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Statutes at Large (little, Brown & Co.), Vol. XI, p. 782.]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act of Congress of the United States of the 24th of May,\r\n1828, entitled \"An act in addition to an act entitled 'An act concerning\r\ndiscriminating duties of tonnage and impost' and to equalize the duties\r\non Prussian vessels and their cargoes,\" it is provided that, upon\r\nsatisfactory evidence being given to the President of the United States\r\nby the government of any foreign nation that no discriminating duties of\r\ntonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the said nation\r\nupon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States or upon\r\nthe produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from\r\nthe United States or from any foreign country, the President is hereby\r\nauthorized to issue his proclamation declaring that the foreign\r\ndiscriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are\r\nand shall be suspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels\r\nof the said foreign nation and the produce, manufactures, or merchandise\r\nimported into the United States in the same from the said foreign nation\r\nor from any other foreign country, the said suspension to take effect\r\nfrom the time of such notification being given to the President of the\r\nUnited States and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of\r\nvessels belonging to citizens of the United States and their cargoes,\r\nas aforesaid, shall be continued, and no longer; and\r\n\r\nWhereas satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me from the\r\nGovernment of His Imperial and Royal Highness the Grand Duke of Tuscany,\r\nthrough an official communication of Baron Lederer, the consul-general\r\nof His Imperial and Royal Highness in the United States, under date of\r\nthe 6th day of August, 1836, that no discriminating duties of tonnage\r\nor impost are imposed or levied in the ports of Tuscany upon vessels\r\nwholly belonging to citizens of the United States or upon the produce,\r\nmanufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States\r\nor from any foreign country:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Andrew Jackson, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, do hereby declare and proclaim that the foreign discriminating\r\nduties of tonnage and impost within the United States are and shall be\r\nsuspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels of the Grand\r\nDukedom of Tuscany and the produce, manufactures, or merchandise\r\nimported into the United States in the same from the said Grand Dukedom\r\nor from any other foreign country, the said suspension to take effect\r\nfrom the 6th day of August, 1836, above mentioned, and to continue so\r\nlong as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the\r\nUnited States and their cargoes, as aforesaid, shall be continued, and\r\nno longer.

HARRIS, Esq.,\r\n\r\n_Acting Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I reached home on the evening of the 4th, and was soon surrounded\r\nwith the papers and letters which had been sent here in anticipation of\r\nmy arrival. Amongst other important matters which immediately engaged my\r\nattention was the requisition of General Gaines on Tennessee, Kentucky,\r\nMississippi, and Louisiana. Believing that the reasons given for this\r\nrequisition were not consistent with the neutrality which it is our\r\nduty to observe in respect to the contest in Texas, and that it would\r\nembarrass the apportionment which had been made of the 10,000 volunteers\r\nauthorized by the recent act of Congress, I informed Governor Cannon by\r\nletter on the 5th instant that it could not receive my sanction. The\r\nvolunteers authorized by Congress were thought competent, with the aid\r\nof the regular force, to terminate the Indian war in the South and\r\nprotect our western frontier, and they were apportioned in a manner\r\nthe best calculated to secure these objects. Agreeably to this\r\napportionment, the volunteers raised in Arkansas and Missouri, and\r\nordered to be held in readiness for the defense of the western frontier,\r\nshould have been called on before any other requisition was made upon\r\nTennessee, who has already more than her proportion in the field. Should\r\nan emergency hereafter arise making it necessary to have a greater force\r\non that frontier than was anticipated when the apportionment was made,\r\nit will be easy to order the east Tennessee brigade there. All the\r\nvolunteers under the act are engaged for one year's service, unless\r\nsooner discharged. Taking this view of the subject, I regret that as\r\nsoon as the War Department had information of the requisition made by\r\nGeneral Gaines it had not at once notified the governors of the States\r\nthat the apportionment of the volunteers at first communicated to them\r\nwould not be departed from, and that of course those in the States\r\nnearest to the scene of threatened hostility would be first called on.\r\n\r\nI had written thus far when your letter of the 26th of July last,\r\naccompanied by one from General Wool of the 15th of July and one from\r\nGeneral Towsen of the 25th of July last, was handed to me. The letter\r\nfrom General Wool was unexpected. His guide was the requisition on\r\nthe State, and I can not well imagine how he could suppose that the\r\nDepartment would authorize a greater number of troops to be mustered and\r\npaid than he was specially directed to receive. He was apprised fully of\r\nthe apportionment which had been made of the 10,000 volunteers, and of\r\nthe considerations which induced us to require 1,000 from Florida, 2,000\r\nfrom Georgia, 2,000 from Alabama, and 2,500 from Tennessee. This force\r\nwas designated in this manner because it was in the country nearest to\r\nthe Seminoles, Creeks, and Cherokees, and in like manner near the force\r\ndesignated for the western frontier, except a fraction of about 430 men\r\nto be hereafter selected when it should be ascertained where it would be\r\nmost needed. It is therefore unaccountable to me why General Wool would\r\nreceive and muster into the service a greater number than has been\r\ncalled for and placed under his command, particularly as he knew that\r\nTennessee had already been called upon for more volunteers than her\r\nproportion in the general apportionment. He knows that the President\r\ncan only execute the law, and he ought to have recollected that if the\r\nofficers charged with the military operations contemplated by the law\r\nwere to use their own discretion in fixing the number of men to be\r\nreceived and mustered into the service there could be no certainty in\r\nthe amount of force which would be brought into the field. His guide\r\nwas the requisition upon Tennessee for 2,500, and he should never have\r\ndeparted from it.\r\n\r\nThe brave men whose patriotism brought them into the field ought to be\r\npaid, but I seriously doubt whether any of the money now appropriated\r\ncan be used for this purpose, as all the volunteers authorized by the\r\nact of Congress have been apportioned, and the appropriations should\r\nbe first applicable to their payment if they should be ordered into\r\nthe field. All that we can do is to bring the subject before the next\r\nCongress, which I trust will pass an act authorizing the payment. Those\r\nmen obeyed the summons of their country, and ought not to suffer for the\r\nindiscretion of those who caused more of them to turn out than could be\r\nreceived into the service. The excess would have been avoided had the\r\ngovernor of Tennessee apportioned his requisition to each county or\r\nregiment, so as to make the proper number. This, however, can now only\r\nbe regretted. I can not approve the mustering or reception into the\r\nservice of the excess further than it may have been done to secure them\r\nhereafter the justice which it will be in the power of Congress to\r\nextend to them. They ought to be paid for their travel and expense to,\r\nat, and from the place of rendezvous, and Congress will doubtless pass\r\nthe necessary law. Their promptness in tendering their services and\r\nequipping themselves for the field is a high evidence of patriotism,\r\nand the thanks of their country.\r\n\r\nI shall inclose a copy of this letter to General Wool, and write to the\r\ngovernors of Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana to withhold for the\r\npresent the quota called for under General Gaines's requisition, and if\r\nthey are concentrated to muster and discharge them and wait for further\r\norders.\r\n\r\nI am, yours, respectfully,\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 5, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAddressing to you the last annual message I shall ever present to the\r\nCongress of the United States, it is a source of the most heartfelt\r\nsatisfaction to be able to congratulate you on the high state of\r\nprosperity which our beloved country has attained. With no causes at\r\nhome or abroad to lessen the confidence with which we look to the future\r\nfor continuing proofs of the capacity of our free institutions to\r\nproduce all the fruits of good government, the general condition of our\r\naffairs may well excite our national pride.\r\n\r\nI can not avoid congratulating you, and my country particularly, on the\r\nsuccess of the efforts made during my Administration by the Executive\r\nand Legislature, in conformity with the sincere, constant, and earnest\r\ndesire of the people, to maintain peace and establish cordial relations\r\nwith all foreign powers. Our gratitude is due to the Supreme Ruler of\r\nthe Universe, and I invite you to unite with me in offering to Him\r\nfervent supplications that His providential care may ever be extended to\r\nthose who follow us, enabling them to avoid the dangers and the horrors\r\nof war consistently with a just and indispensable regard to the rights\r\nand honor of our country. But although the present state of our foreign\r\naffairs, standing, without important change, as they did when you\r\nseparated in July last, is flattering in the extreme, I regret to say\r\nthat many questions of an interesting character, at issue with other\r\npowers, are yet unadjusted. Amongst the most prominent of these is that\r\nof our northeastern boundary. With an undiminished confidence in the\r\nsincere desire of His Britannic Majesty's Government to adjust that\r\nquestion, I am not yet in possession of the precise grounds upon which\r\nit proposes a satisfactory adjustment.\r\n\r\nWith France our diplomatic relations have been resumed, and under\r\ncircumstances which attest the disposition of both Governments to\r\npreserve a mutually beneficial intercourse and foster those amicable\r\nfeelings which are so strongly required by the true interests of the two\r\ncountries. With Russia, Austria, Prussia, Naples, Sweden, and Denmark\r\nthe best understanding exists, and our commercial intercourse is\r\ngradually expanding itself with them. It is encouraged in all these\r\ncountries, except Naples, by their mutually advantageous and liberal\r\ntreaty stipulations with us.\r\n\r\nThe claims of our citizens on Portugal are admitted to be just, but\r\nprovision for the payment of them has been unfortunately delayed by\r\nfrequent political changes in that Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe blessings of peace have not been secured by Spain. Our connections\r\nwith that country are on the best footing, with the exception of the\r\nburdens still imposed upon our commerce with her possessions out of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe claims of American citizens for losses sustained at the bombardment\r\nof Antwerp have been presented to the Governments of Holland and\r\nBelgium, and will be pressed, in due season, to settlement.\r\n\r\nWith Brazil and all our neighbors of this continent we continue to\r\nmaintain relations of amity and concord, extending our commerce with\r\nthem as far as the resources of the people and the policy of their\r\nGovernments will permit. The just and long-standing claims of our\r\ncitizens upon some of them are yet sources of dissatisfaction and\r\ncomplaint. No danger is apprehended, however, that they will not be\r\npeacefully, although tardily, acknowledged and paid by all, unless the\r\nirritating effect of her struggle with Texas should unfortunately make\r\nour immediate neighbor, Mexico, an exception.\r\n\r\nIt is already known to you, by the correspondence between the two\r\nGovernments communicated at your last session, that our conduct in\r\nrelation to that struggle is regulated by the same principles that\r\ngoverned us in the dispute between Spain and Mexico herself, and I trust\r\nthat it will be found on the most severe scrutiny that our acts have\r\nstrictly corresponded with our professions. That the inhabitants of the\r\nUnited States should feel strong prepossessions for the one party is\r\nnot surprising. But this circumstance should of itself teach us great\r\ncaution, lest it lead us into the great error of suffering public policy\r\nto be regulated by partiality or prejudice; and there are considerations\r\nconnected with the possible result of this contest between the two\r\nparties of so much delicacy and importance to the United States that our\r\ncharacter requires that we should neither anticipate events nor attempt\r\nto control them. The known desire of the Texans to become a part of\r\nour system, although its gratification depends upon the reconcilement\r\nof various and conflicting interests, necessarily a work of time\r\nand uncertain in itself, is calculated to expose our conduct to\r\nmisconstruction in the eyes of the world. There are already those who,\r\nindifferent to principle themselves and prone to suspect the want of\r\nit in others, charge us with ambitious designs and insidious policy.\r\nYou will perceive by the accompanying documents that the extraordinary\r\nmission from Mexico has been terminated on the sole ground that the\r\nobligations of this Government to itself and to Mexico, under treaty\r\nstipulations, have compelled me to trust a discretionary authority to\r\na high officer of our Army to advance into territory claimed as part of\r\nTexas if necessary to protect our own or the neighboring frontier from\r\nIndian depredation. In the opinion of the Mexican functionary who has\r\njust left us, the honor of his country will be wounded by American\r\nsoldiers entering, with the most amicable avowed purposes, upon ground\r\nfrom which the followers of his Government have been expelled, and over\r\nwhich there is at present no certainty of a serious effort on its part\r\nbeing made to reestablish its dominion. The departure of this minister\r\nwas the more singular as he was apprised that the sufficiency of the\r\ncauses assigned for the advance of our troops by the commanding general\r\nhad been seriously doubted by me, and there was every reason to suppose\r\nthat the troops of the United States, their commander having had time to\r\nascertain the truth or falsehood of the information upon which they had\r\nbeen marched to Nacogdoches, would be either there in perfect accordance\r\nwith the principles admitted to be just in his conference with the\r\nSecretary of State by the Mexican minister himself, or were already\r\nwithdrawn in consequence of the impressive warnings their commanding\r\nofficer had received from the Department of War. It is hoped and\r\nbelieved that his Government will take a more dispassionate and just\r\nview of this subject, and not be disposed to construe a measure of\r\njustifiable precaution, made necessary by its known inability in\r\nexecution of the stipulations of our treaty to act upon the frontier,\r\ninto an encroachment upon its rights or a stain upon its honor.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the ancient complaints of injustice made on behalf of\r\nour citizens are disregarded, and new causes of dissatisfaction have\r\narisen, some of them of a character requiring prompt remonstrance and\r\nample and immediate redress. I trust, however, by tempering firmness\r\nwith courtesy and acting with great forbearance upon every incident that\r\nhas occurred or that may happen, to do and to obtain justice, and thus\r\navoid the necessity of again bringing this subject to the view of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIt is my duty to remind you that no provision has been made to execute\r\nour treaty with Mexico for tracing the boundary line between the two\r\ncountries. Whatever may be the prospect of Mexico's being soon able\r\nto execute the treaty on its part, it is proper that we should be in\r\nanticipation prepared at all times to perform our obligations, without\r\nregard to the probable condition of those with whom we have contracted\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe result of the confidential inquiries made into the condition and\r\nprospects of the newly declared Texan Government will be communicated\r\nto you in the course of the session.\r\n\r\nCommercial treaties promising great advantages to our enterprising\r\nmerchants and navigators have been formed with the distant Governments\r\nof Muscat and Siam. The ratifications have been exchanged, but have\r\nnot reached the Department of State. Copies of the treaties will be\r\ntransmitted to you if received before, or published if arriving after,\r\nthe close of the present session of Congress.\r\n\r\nNothing has occurred to interrupt the good understanding that has long\r\nexisted with the Barbary Powers, nor to check the good will which is\r\ngradually growing up from our intercourse with the dominions of the\r\nGovernment of the distinguished chief of the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nInformation has been received at the Department of State that a treaty\r\nwith the Emperor of Morocco has just been negotiated, which, I hope,\r\nwill be received in time to be laid before the Senate previous to the\r\nclose of the session.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive from the report of the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nthat the financial means of the country continue to keep pace with its\r\nimprovement in all other respects. The receipts into the Treasury during\r\nthe present year will amount to about $47,691,898; those from customs\r\nbeing estimated at $22,523,151, those from lands at about $24,000,000,\r\nand the residue from miscellaneous sources. The expenditures for all\r\nobjects during the year are estimated not to exceed $32,000,000, which\r\nwill leave a balance in the Treasury for public purposes on the 1st day\r\nof January next of about $41,723,959. This sum, with the exception of\r\n$5,000,000, will be transferred to the several States in accordance with\r\nthe provisions of the act regulating the deposits of the public money.\r\n\r\nThe unexpended balances of appropriation on the 1st day of January next\r\nare estimated at $14,636,062, exceeding by $9,636,062 the amount which\r\nwill be left in the deposit banks, subject to the draft of the Treasurer\r\nof the United States, after the contemplated transfers to the several\r\nStates are made. If, therefore, the future receipts should not be\r\nsufficient to meet these outstanding and future appropriations, there\r\nmay be soon a necessity to use a portion of the funds deposited with\r\nthe States.\r\n\r\nThe consequences apprehended when the deposit act of the last session\r\nreceived a reluctant approval have been measurably realized. Though an\r\nact merely for the deposit of the surplus moneys of the United States in\r\nthe State treasuries for safe-keeping until they may be wanted for the\r\nservice of the General Government, it has been extensively spoken of\r\nas an act to give the money to the several States, and they have been\r\nadvised to use it as a gift, without regard to the means of refunding\r\nit when called for. Such a suggestion has doubtless been made without\r\na due consideration of the obligations of the deposit act, and without\r\na proper attention to the various principles and interests which are\r\naffected by it. It is manifest that the law itself can not sanction\r\nsuch a suggestion, and that as it now stands the States have no more\r\nauthority to receive and use these deposits without intending to return\r\nthem than any deposit bank or any individual temporarily charged with\r\nthe safe-keeping or application of the public money would now have for\r\nconverting the same to their private use without the consent and against\r\nthe will of the Government. But independently of the violation of public\r\nfaith and moral obligation which are involved in this suggestion when\r\nexamined in reference to the terms of the present deposit act, it\r\nis believed that the considerations which should govern the future\r\nlegislation of Congress on this subject will be equally conclusive\r\nagainst the adoption of any measure recognizing the principles on\r\nwhich the suggestion has been made.\r\n\r\nConsidering the intimate connection of the subject with the financial\r\ninterests of the country and its great importance in whatever aspect\r\nit can be viewed, I have bestowed upon it the most anxious reflection,\r\nand feel it to be my duty to state to Congress such thoughts as have\r\noccurred to me, to aid their deliberation in treating it in the manner\r\nbest calculated to conduce to the common good.\r\n\r\nThe experience of other nations admonished us to hasten the\r\nextinguishment of the public debt; but it will be in vain that we have\r\ncongratulated each other upon the disappearance of this evil if we do\r\nnot guard against the equally great one of promoting the unnecessary\r\naccumulation of public revenue. No political maxim is better established\r\nthan that which tells us that an improvident expenditure of money is the\r\nparent of profligacy, and that no people can hope to perpetuate their\r\nliberties who long acquiesce in a policy which taxes them for objects\r\nnot necessary to the legitimate and real wants of their Government.\r\nFlattering as is the condition of our country at the present period,\r\nbecause of its unexampled advance in all the steps of social and\r\npolitical improvement, it can not be disguised that there is a lurking\r\ndanger already apparent in the neglect of this warning truth, and that\r\nthe time has arrived when the representatives of the people should be\r\nemployed in devising some more appropriate remedy than now exists to\r\navert it.\r\n\r\nUnder our present revenue system there is every probability that there\r\nwill continue to be a surplus beyond the wants of the Government, and it\r\nhas become our duty to decide whether such a result be consistent with\r\nthe true objects of our Government.\r\n\r\nShould a surplus be permitted to accumulate beyond the appropriations,\r\nit must be retained in the Treasury, as it now is, or distributed among\r\nthe people or the States.\r\n\r\nTo retain it in the Treasury unemployed in any way is impracticable; it\r\nis, besides, against the genius of our free institutions to lock up in\r\nvaults the treasure of the nation. To take from the people the right of\r\nbearing arms and put their weapons of defense in the hands of a standing\r\narmy would be scarcely more dangerous to their liberties than to permit\r\nthe Government to accumulate immense amounts of treasure beyond the\r\nsupplies necessary to its legitimate wants. Such a treasure would\r\ndoubtless be employed at some time, as it has been in other countries,\r\nwhen opportunity tempted ambition.\r\n\r\nTo collect it merely for distribution to the States would seem to be\r\nhighly impolitic, if not as dangerous as the proposition to retain it\r\nin the Treasury. The shortest reflection must satisfy everyone that to\r\nrequire the people to pay taxes to the Government merely that they may\r\nbe paid back again is sporting with the substantial interests of the\r\ncountry, and no system which produces such a result can be expected to\r\nreceive the public countenance. Nothing could be gained by it even if\r\neach individual who contributed a portion of the tax could receive back\r\npromptly the same portion. But it is apparent that no system of the kind\r\ncan ever be enforced which will not absorb a considerable portion of\r\nthe money to be distributed in salaries and commissions to the agents\r\nemployed in the process and in the various losses and depreciations\r\nwhich arise from other causes, and the practical effect of such an\r\nattempt must ever be to burden the people with taxes, not for purposes\r\nbeneficial to them, but to swell the profits of deposit banks and\r\nsupport a band of useless public officers.\r\n\r\nA distribution to the people is impracticable and unjust in other\r\nrespects. It would be taking one man's property and giving it to\r\nanother. Such would be the unavoidable result of a rule of equality\r\n(and none other is spoken of or would be likely to be adopted), inasmuch\r\nas there is no mode by which the amount of the individual contributions\r\nof our citizens to the public revenue can be ascertained. We know\r\nthat they contribute _unequally_, and a rule, therefore, that would\r\ndistribute to them _equally_ would be liable to all the objections\r\nwhich apply to the principle of an equal division of property. To make\r\nthe General Government the instrument of carrying this odious principle\r\ninto effect would be at once to destroy the means of its usefulness and\r\nchange the character designed for it by the framers of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nBut the more extended and injurious consequences likely to result\r\nfrom a policy which would collect a surplus revenue for the purpose of\r\ndistributing it may be forcibly illustrated by an examination of the\r\neffects already produced by the present deposit act. This act, although\r\ncertainly designed to secure the safe-keeping of the public revenue,\r\nis not entirely free in its tendencies from any of the objections which\r\napply to this principle of distribution. The Government had without\r\nnecessity received from the people a large surplus, which, instead\r\nof being employed as heretofore and returned to them by means of the\r\npublic expenditure, was deposited with sundry banks. The banks proceeded\r\nto make loans upon this surplus, and thus converted it into banking\r\ncapital, and in this manner it has tended to multiply bank charters\r\nand has had a great agency in producing a spirit of wild speculation.\r\nThe possession and use of the property out of which this surplus was\r\ncreated belonged to the people, but the Government has transferred its\r\npossession to incorporated banks, whose interest and effort it is to\r\nmake large profits out of its use. This process need only be stated\r\nto show its injustice and bad policy.\r\n\r\nAnd the same observations apply to the influence which is produced by\r\nthe steps necessary to collect as well as to distribute such a revenue.\r\nAbout three-fifths of all the duties on imports are paid in the city\r\nof New York, but it is obvious that the means to pay those duties are\r\ndrawn from every quarter of the Union. Every citizen in every State who\r\npurchases and consumes an article which has paid a duty at that port\r\ncontributes to the accumulating mass. The surplus collected there must\r\ntherefore be made up of moneys or property withdrawn from other points\r\nand other States. Thus the wealth and business of every region from\r\nwhich these surplus funds proceed must be to some extent injured, while\r\nthat of the place where the funds are concentrated and are employed in\r\nbanking are proportionably extended. But both in making the transfer\r\nof the funds which are first necessary to pay the duties and collect\r\nthe surplus and in making the retransfer which becomes necessary when\r\nthe time arrives for the distribution of that surplus there is a\r\nconsiderable period when the funds can not be brought into use, and it\r\nis manifest that, besides the loss inevitable from such an operation,\r\nits tendency is to produce fluctuations in the business of the country,\r\nwhich are always productive of speculation and detrimental to the\r\ninterests of regular trade. Argument can scarcely be necessary to\r\nshow that a measure of this character ought not to receive further\r\nlegislative encouragement.\r\n\r\nBy examining the practical operation of the ratio for distribution\r\nadopted in the deposit bill of the last session we shall discover other\r\nfeatures that appear equally objectionable. Let it be assumed, for the\r\nsake of argument, that the surplus moneys to be deposited with the\r\nStates have been collected and belong to them in the ratio of their\r\nfederal representative population--an assumption founded upon the fact\r\nthat any deficiencies in our future revenue from imposts and public\r\nlands must be made up by direct taxes collected from the States in that\r\nratio. It is proposed to distribute this surplus--say $30,000,000--not\r\naccording to the ratio in which it has been collected and belongs to\r\nthe people of the States, but in that of their votes in the colleges of\r\nelectors of President and Vice-President. The effect of a distribution\r\nupon that ratio is shown by the annexed table, marked A.\r\n\r\nBy an examination of that table it will be perceived that in the\r\ndistribution of a surplus of $30,000,000 upon that basis there is a\r\ngreat departure from the principle which regards representation as the\r\ntrue measure of taxation, and it will be found that the tendency of that\r\ndeparture will be to increase whatever inequalities have been supposed\r\nto attend the operation of our federal system in respect to its bearings\r\nupon the different interests of the Union. In making the basis of\r\nrepresentation the basis of taxation the framers of the Constitution\r\nintended to equalize the burdens which are necessary to support the\r\nGovernment, and the adoption of that ratio, while it accomplished this\r\nobject, was also the means of adjusting other great topics arising out\r\nof the conflicting views respecting the political equality of the\r\nvarious members of the Confederacy. Whatever, therefore, disturbs the\r\nliberal spirit of the compromises which established a rule of taxation\r\nso just and equitable, and which experience has proved to be so well\r\nadapted to the genius and habits of our people, should be received with\r\nthe greatest caution and distrust.\r\n\r\nA bare inspection in the annexed table of the differences produced\r\nby the ratio used in the deposit act compared with the results of a\r\ndistribution according to the ratio of direct taxation must satisfy\r\nevery unprejudiced mind that the former ratio contravenes the spirit of\r\nthe Constitution and produces a degree of injustice in the operations of\r\nthe Federal Government which would be fatal to the hope of perpetuating\r\nit. By the ratio of direct taxation, for example, the State of Delaware\r\nin the collection of $30,000,000 of revenue would pay into the Treasury\r\n$188,716, and in a distribution of $30,000,000 she would receive back\r\nfrom the Government, according to the ratio of the deposit bill, the\r\nsum of $306,122; and similar results would follow the comparison between\r\nthe small and the large States throughout the Union, thus realizing to\r\nthe small States an advantage which would be doubtless as unacceptable\r\nto them as a motive for incorporating the principle in any system\r\nwhich would produce it as it would be inconsistent with the rights and\r\nexpectations of the large States. It was certainly the intention of that\r\nprovision of the Constitution which declares that \"all duties, imposts,\r\nand excises\" shall \"be uniform throughout the United States\" to make the\r\nburdens of taxation fall equally upon the people in whatever State of\r\nthe Union they may reside. But what would be the value of such a uniform\r\nrule if the moneys raised by it could be immediately returned by a\r\ndifferent one which will give to the people of some States much more\r\nand to those of others much less than their fair proportions? Were the\r\nFederal Government to exempt in express terms the imports, products,\r\nand manufactures of some portions of the country from all duties while\r\nit imposed heavy ones on others, the injustice could not be greater. It\r\nwould be easy to show how by the operation of such a principle the large\r\nStates of the Union would not only have to contribute their just share\r\ntoward the support of the Federal Government, but also have to bear in\r\nsome degree the taxes necessary to support the governments of their\r\nsmaller sisters; but it is deemed unnecessary to state the details\r\nwhere the general principle is so obvious.\r\n\r\nA system liable to such objections can never be supposed to have\r\nbeen sanctioned by the framers of the Constitution when they conferred\r\non Congress the taxing power, and I feel persuaded that a mature\r\nexamination of the subject will satisfy everyone that there are\r\ninsurmountable difficulties in the operation of any plan which can\r\nbe devised of collecting revenue for the purpose of distributing it.\r\nCongress is only authorized to levy taxes \"_to pay the debts and provide\r\nfor the common defense and general welfare of the United States_.\" There\r\nis no such provision as would authorize Congress to collect together the\r\nproperty of the country, under the name of revenue, for the purpose of\r\ndividing it equally or unequally among the States or the people. Indeed,\r\nit is not probable that such an idea ever occurred to the States when\r\nthey adopted the Constitution. But however this may be, the only safe\r\nrule for us in interpreting the powers granted to the Federal Government\r\nis to regard the absence of express authority to touch a subject so\r\nimportant and delicate as this is as equivalent to a prohibition.\r\n\r\nEven if our powers were less doubtful in this respect as the\r\nConstitution now stands, there are considerations afforded by recent\r\nexperience which would seem to make it our duty to avoid a resort to\r\nsuch a system.\r\n\r\nAll will admit that the simplicity and economy of the State governments\r\nmainly depend on the fact that money has to be supplied to support them\r\nby the same men, or their agents, who vote it away in appropriations.\r\nHence when there are extravagant and wasteful appropriations there must\r\nbe a corresponding increase of taxes, and the people, becoming awakened,\r\nwill necessarily scrutinize the character of measures which thus\r\nincrease their burdens. By the watchful eye of self-interest the agents\r\nof the people in the State governments are repressed and kept within\r\nthe limits of a just economy. But if the necessity of levying the\r\ntaxes be taken from those who make the appropriations and thrown upon\r\na more distant and less responsible set of public agents, who have\r\npower to approach the people by an indirect and stealthy taxation,\r\nthere is reason to fear that prodigality will soon supersede those\r\ncharacteristics which have thus far made us look with so much pride and\r\nconfidence to the State governments as the mainstay of our Union and\r\nliberties. The State legislatures, instead of studying to restrict their\r\nState expenditures to the smallest possible sum, will claim credit\r\nfor their profusion, and harass the General Government for increased\r\nsupplies. Practically there would soon be but one taxing power, and\r\nthat vested in a body of men far removed from the people, in which the\r\nfarming and mechanic interests would scarcely be represented. The States\r\nwould gradually lose their purity as well as their independence; they\r\nwould not dare to murmur at the proceedings of the General Government,\r\nlest they should lose their supplies; all would be merged in a practical\r\nconsolidation, cemented by widespread corruption, which could only\r\nbe eradicated by one of those bloody revolutions which occasionally\r\noverthrow the despotic systems of the Old World. In all the other\r\naspects in which I have been able to look at the effect of such a\r\nprinciple of distribution upon the best interests of the country I\r\ncan see nothing to compensate for the disadvantages to which I have\r\nadverted. If we consider the protective duties, which are in a great\r\ndegree the source of the surplus revenue, beneficial to one section of\r\nthe Union and prejudicial to another, there is no corrective for the\r\nevil in such a plan of distribution. On the contrary, there is reason to\r\nfear that all the complaints which have sprung from this cause would be\r\naggravated. Everyone must be sensible that a distribution of the surplus\r\nmust beget a disposition to cherish the means which create it, and any\r\nsystem, therefore, into which it enters must have a powerful tendency to\r\nincrease rather than diminish the tariff. If it were even admitted that\r\nthe advantages of such a system could be made equal to all the sections\r\nof the Union, the reasons already so urgently calling for a reduction of\r\nthe revenue would nevertheless lose none of their force, for it will\r\nalways be improbable that an intelligent and virtuous community can\r\nconsent to raise a surplus for the mere purpose of dividing it,\r\ndiminished as it must inevitably be by the expenses of the various\r\nmachinery necessary to the process.\r\n\r\nThe safest and simplest mode of obviating all the difficulties which\r\nhave been mentioned is to collect only revenue enough to meet the wants\r\nof the Government, and let the people keep the balance of their property\r\nin their own hands, to be used for their own profit. Each State will\r\nthen support its own government and contribute its due share toward the\r\nsupport of the General Government. There would be no surplus to cramp\r\nand lessen the resources of individual wealth and enterprise, and the\r\nbanks would be left to their ordinary means. Whatever agitations and\r\nfluctuations might arise from our unfortunate paper system, they could\r\nnever be attributed, justly or unjustly, to the action of the Federal\r\nGovernment. There would be some guaranty that the spirit of wild\r\nspeculation which seeks to convert the surplus revenue into banking\r\ncapital would be effectually checked, and that the scenes of\r\ndemoralization which are now so prevalent through the land would\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nWithout desiring to conceal that the experience and observation of the\r\nlast two years have operated a partial change in my views upon this\r\ninteresting subject, it is nevertheless regretted that the suggestions\r\nmade by me in my annual messages of 1829 and 1830 have been greatly\r\nmisunderstood. At that time the great struggle was begun against that\r\nlatitudinarian construction of the Constitution which authorizes the\r\nunlimited appropriation of the revenues of the Union to internal\r\nimprovements within the States, tending to invest in the hands and place\r\nunder the control of the General Government all the principal roads and\r\ncanals of the country, in violation of State rights and in derogation\r\nof State authority. At the same time the condition of the manufacturing\r\ninterest was such as to create an apprehension that the duties on\r\nimports could not without extensive mischief be reduced in season to\r\nprevent the accumulation of a considerable surplus after the payment\r\nof the national debt. In view of the dangers of such a surplus, and in\r\npreference to its application to internal improvements in derogation of\r\nthe rights and powers of the States, the suggestion of an amendment\r\nof the Constitution to authorize its distribution was made. It was an\r\nalternative for what were deemed greater evils--a temporary resort to\r\nrelieve an overburdened treasury until the Government could, without\r\na sudden and destructive revulsion in the business of the country,\r\ngradually return to the just principle of raising no more revenue from\r\nthe people in taxes than is necessary for its economical support. Even\r\nthat alternative was not spoken of but in connection with an amendment\r\nof the Constitution. No temporary inconvenience can justify the exercise\r\nof a prohibited power or a power not granted by that instrument, and\r\nit was from a conviction that the power to distribute even a temporary\r\nsurplus of revenue is of that character that it was suggested only in\r\nconnection with an appeal to the source of all legal power in the\r\nGeneral Government, the States which have established it. No such\r\nappeal has been taken, and in my opinion a distribution of the surplus\r\nrevenue by Congress either to the States or the people is to be\r\nconsidered as among the prohibitions of the Constitution. As already\r\nintimated, my views have undergone a change so far as to be convinced\r\nthat no alteration of the Constitution in this respect is wise or\r\nexpedient. The influence of an accumulating surplus upon the legislation\r\nof the General Government and the States, its effect upon the credit\r\nsystem of the country, producing dangerous extensions and ruinous\r\ncontractions, fluctuations in the price of property, rash speculation,\r\nidleness, extravagance, and a deterioration of morals, have taught us\r\nthe important lesson that any transient mischief which may attend the\r\nreduction of our revenue to the wants of our Government is to be borne\r\nin preference to an overflowing treasury.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to call your attention to another subject intimately\r\nassociated with the preceding one--the currency of the country.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from the whole context of the Constitution, as well as\r\nthe history of the times which gave birth to it, that it was the purpose\r\nof the Convention to establish a currency consisting of the precious\r\nmetals. These, from their peculiar properties which rendered them the\r\nstandard of value in all other countries, were adopted in this as well\r\nto establish its commercial standard in reference to foreign countries\r\nby a permanent rule as to exclude the use of a mutable medium of\r\nexchange, such as of certain agricultural commodities recognized by\r\nthe statutes of some States as a tender for debts, or the still more\r\npernicious expedient of a paper currency. The last, from the experience\r\nof the evils of the issues of paper during the Revolution, had become so\r\njustly obnoxious as not only to suggest the clause in the Constitution\r\nforbidding the emission of bills of credit by the States, but also to\r\nproduce that vote in the Convention which negatived the proposition to\r\ngrant power to Congress to charter corporations--a proposition well\r\nunderstood at the time as intended to authorize the establishment of a\r\nnational bank, which was to issue a currency of bank notes on a capital\r\nto be created to some extent out of Government stocks. Although this\r\nproposition was refused by a direct vote of the Convention, the object\r\nwas afterwards in effect obtained by its ingenious advocates through a\r\nstrained construction of the Constitution. The debts of the Revolution\r\nwere funded at prices which formed no equivalent compared with the\r\nnominal amount of the stock, and under circumstances which exposed the\r\nmotives of some of those who participated in the passage of the act\r\nto distrust.\r\n\r\nThe facts that the value of the stock was greatly enhanced by the\r\ncreation of the bank, that it was well understood that such would be\r\nthe case, and that some of the advocates of the measure were largely\r\nbenefited by it belong to the history of the times, and are well\r\ncalculated to diminish the respect which might otherwise have been\r\ndue to the action of the Congress which created the institution.\r\n\r\nOn the establishment of a national bank it became the interest of its\r\ncreditors that gold should be superseded by the paper of the bank as a\r\ngeneral currency. A value was soon attached to the gold coins which made\r\ntheir exportation to foreign countries as a mercantile commodity more\r\nprofitable than their retention and use at home as money. It followed\r\nas a matter of course, if not designed by those who established the\r\nbank, that the bank became in effect a substitute for the Mint of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nSuch was the origin of a national-bank currency, and such the beginning\r\nof those difficulties which now appear in the excessive issues of the\r\nbanks incorporated by the various States.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may not be possible by any legislative means within our\r\npower to change at once the system which has thus been introduced, and\r\nhas received the acquiescence of all portions of the country, it is\r\ncertainly our duty to do all that is consistent with our constitutional\r\nobligations in preventing the mischiefs which are threatened by its\r\nundue extension. That the efforts of the fathers of our Government to\r\nguard against it by a constitutional provision were founded on an\r\nintimate knowledge of the subject has been frequently attested by the\r\nbitter experience of the country. The same causes which led them to\r\nrefuse their sanction to a power authorizing the establishment of\r\nincorporations for banking purposes now exist in a much stronger degree\r\nto urge us to exert the utmost vigilance in calling into action the\r\nmeans necessary to correct the evils resulting from the unfortunate\r\nexercise of the power, and it is to be hoped that the opportunity for\r\neffecting this great good will be improved before the country witnesses\r\nnew scenes of embarrassment and distress.\r\n\r\nVariableness must ever be the characteristic of a currency of which the\r\nprecious metals are not the chief ingredient, or which can be expanded\r\nor contracted without regard to the principles that regulate the value\r\nof those metals as a standard in the general trade of the world. With us\r\nbank issues constitute such a currency, and must ever do so until they\r\nare made dependent on those just proportions of gold and silver as a\r\ncirculating medium which experience has proved to be necessary not only\r\nin this but in all other commercial countries. Where those proportions\r\nare not infused into the circulation and do not control it, it is\r\nmanifest that prices must vary according to the tide of bank issues,\r\nand the value and stability of property must stand exposed to all the\r\nuncertainty which attends the administration of institutions that are\r\nconstantly liable to the temptation of an interest distinct from that\r\nof the community in which they are established.\r\n\r\nThe progress of an expansion, or rather a depreciation, of the currency\r\nby excessive bank issues is always attended by a loss to the laboring\r\nclasses. This portion of the community have neither time nor opportunity\r\nto watch the ebbs and flows of the money market. Engaged from day to day\r\nin their useful toils, they do not perceive that although their wages\r\nare nominally the same, or even somewhat higher, they are greatly\r\nreduced in fact by the rapid increase of a spurious currency, which, as\r\nit appears to make money abound, they are at first inclined to consider\r\na blessing. It is not so with the speculator, by whom this operation\r\nis better understood, and is made to contribute to his advantage. It is\r\nnot until the prices of the necessaries of life become so dear that the\r\nlaboring classes can not supply their wants out of their wages that the\r\nwages rise and gradually reach a justly proportioned rate to that of the\r\nproducts of their labor. When thus, by the depreciation in consequence\r\nof the quantity of paper in circulation, wages as well as prices become\r\nexorbitant, it is soon found that the whole effect of the adulteration\r\nis a tariff on our home industry for the benefit of the countries where\r\ngold and silver circulate and maintain uniformity and moderation in\r\nprices. It is then perceived that the enhancement of the price of land\r\nand labor produces a corresponding increase in the price of products\r\nuntil these products do not sustain a competition with similar ones in\r\nother countries, and thus both manufactured and agricultural productions\r\ncease to bear exportation from the country of the spurious currency,\r\nbecause they can not be sold for cost. This is the process by which\r\nspecie is banished by the paper of the banks. Their vaults are soon\r\nexhausted to pay for foreign commodities. The next step is a stoppage\r\nof specie payment--a total degradation of paper as a currency--unusual\r\ndepression of prices, the ruin of debtors, and the accumulation of\r\nproperty in the hands of creditors and cautious capitalists.\r\n\r\nIt was in view of these evils, together with the dangerous power wielded\r\nby the Bank of the United States and its repugnance to our Constitution,\r\nthat I was induced to exert the power conferred upon me by the American\r\npeople to prevent the continuance of that institution. But although\r\nvarious dangers to our republican institutions have been obviated by\r\nthe failure of that bank to extort from the Government a renewal of\r\nits charter, it is obvious that little has been accomplished except a\r\nsalutary change of public opinion toward restoring to the country the\r\nsound currency provided for in the Constitution. In the acts of several\r\nof the States prohibiting the circulation of small notes, and the\r\nauxiliary enactments of Congress at the last session forbidding their\r\nreception or payment on public account, the true policy of the country\r\nhas been advanced and a larger portion of the precious metals infused\r\ninto our circulating medium. These measures will probably be followed\r\nup in due time by the enactment of State laws banishing from\r\ncirculation bank notes of still higher denominations, and the object\r\nmay be materially promoted by further acts of Congress forbidding the\r\nemployment as fiscal agents of such banks as continue to issue notes of\r\nlow denominations and throw impediments in the way of the circulation\r\nof gold and silver.\r\n\r\nThe effects of an extension of bank credits and overissues of bank\r\npaper have been strikingly illustrated in the sales of the public lands.\r\nFrom the returns made by the various registers and receivers in the\r\nearly part of last summer it was perceived that the receipts arising\r\nfrom the sales of the public lands were increasing to an unprecedented\r\namount. In effect, however, these receipts amounted to nothing more\r\nthan credits in bank. The banks lent out their notes to speculators.\r\nThey were paid to the receivers and immediately returned to the banks,\r\nto be lent out again and again, being mere instruments to transfer to\r\nspeculators the most valuable public land and pay the Government by a\r\ncredit on the books of the banks. Those credits on the books of some of\r\nthe Western banks, usually called deposits, were already greatly beyond\r\ntheir immediate means of payment, and were rapidly increasing. Indeed,\r\neach speculation furnished means for another; for no sooner had one\r\nindividual or company paid in the notes than they were immediately\r\nlent to another for a like purpose, and the banks were extending their\r\nbusiness and their issues so largely as to alarm considerate men and\r\nrender it doubtful whether these bank credits if permitted to accumulate\r\nwould ultimately be of the least value to the Government. The spirit of\r\nexpansion and speculation was not confined to the deposit banks, but\r\npervaded the whole multitude of banks throughout the Union and was\r\ngiving rise to new institutions to aggravate the evil.\r\n\r\nThe safety of the public funds and the interest of the people generally\r\nrequired that these operations should be checked; and it became the duty\r\nof every branch of the General and State Governments to adopt all\r\nlegitimate and proper means to produce that salutary effect. Under this\r\nview of my duty I directed the issuing of the order which will be laid\r\nbefore you by the Secretary of the Treasury, requiring payment for the\r\npublic lands sold to be made in specie, with an exception until the\r\n15th of the present month in favor of actual settlers. This measure\r\nhas produced many salutary consequences. It checked the career of the\r\nWestern banks and gave them additional strength in anticipation of the\r\npressure which has since pervaded our Eastern as well as the European\r\ncommercial cities. By preventing the extension of the credit system it\r\nmeasurably cut off the means of speculation and retarded its progress\r\nin monopolizing the most valuable of the public lands. It has tended\r\nto save the new States from a nonresident proprietorship, one of\r\nthe greatest obstacles to the advancement of a new country and the\r\nprosperity of an old one. It has tended to keep open the public lands\r\nfor entry by emigrants at Government prices instead of their being\r\ncompelled to purchase of speculators at double or triple prices. And\r\nit is conveying into the interior large sums in silver and gold, there\r\nto enter permanently into the currency of the country and place it on a\r\nfirmer foundation. It is confidently believed that the country will find\r\nin the motives which induced that order and the happy consequences which\r\nwill have ensued much to commend and nothing to condemn.\r\n\r\nIt remains for Congress if they approve the policy which dictated\r\nthis order to follow it up in its various bearings. Much good, in my\r\njudgment, would be produced by prohibiting sales of the public lands\r\nexcept to actual settlers at a reasonable reduction of price, and to\r\nlimit the quantity which shall be sold to them. Although it is believed\r\nthe General Government never ought to receive anything but the\r\nconstitutional currency in exchange for the public lands, that point\r\nwould be of less importance if the lands were sold for immediate\r\nsettlement and cultivation. Indeed, there is scarcely a mischief arising\r\nout of our present land system, including the accumulating surplus of\r\nrevenues, which would not be remedied at once by a restriction on land\r\nsales to actual settlers; and it promises other advantages to the\r\ncountry in general and to the new States in particular which can\r\nnot fail to receive the most profound consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nExperience continues to realize the expectations entertained as to the\r\ncapacity of the State banks to perform the duties of fiscal agents for\r\nthe Government at the time of the removal of the deposits. It was\r\nalleged by the advocates of the Bank of the United States that the State\r\nbanks, whatever might be the regulations of the Treasury Department,\r\ncould not make the transfers required by the Government or negotiate the\r\ndomestic exchanges of the country. It is now well ascertained that the\r\nreal domestic exchanges performed through discounts by the United States\r\nBank and its twenty-five branches were at least one-third less than\r\nthose of the deposit banks for an equal period of time; and if a\r\ncomparison be instituted between the amounts of service rendered by\r\nthese institutions on the broader basis which has been used by the\r\nadvocates of the United States Bank in estimating what they consider\r\nthe domestic exchanges transacted by it, the result will be still more\r\nfavorable to the deposit banks.\r\n\r\nThe whole amount of public money transferred by the Bank of the United\r\nStates in 1832 was $16,000,000. The amount transferred and actually\r\npaid by the deposit banks in the year ending the 1st of October last\r\nwas $39,319,899; the amount transferred and paid between that period\r\nand the 6th of November was $5,399,000, and the amount of transfer\r\nwarrants outstanding on that day was $14,450,000, making an aggregate\r\nof $59,168,894. These enormous sums of money first mentioned have been\r\ntransferred with the greatest promptitude and regularity, and the rates\r\nat which the exchanges have been negotiated previously to the passage of\r\nthe deposit act were generally below those charged by the Bank of the\r\nUnited States. Independently of these services, which are far greater\r\nthan those rendered by the United States Bank and its twenty-five\r\nbranches, a number of the deposit banks have, with a commendable zeal\r\nto aid in the improvement of the currency, imported from abroad, at\r\ntheir own expense, large sums of the precious metals for coinage and\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner have nearly all the predictions turned out in respect\r\nto the effect of the removal of the deposits--a step unquestionably\r\nnecessary to prevent the evils which it was foreseen the bank itself\r\nwould endeavor to create in a final struggle to procure a renewal of\r\nits charter. It may be thus, too, in some degree with the further steps\r\nwhich may be taken to prevent the excessive issue of other bank paper,\r\nbut it is to be hoped that nothing will now deter the Federal and State\r\nauthorities from the firm and vigorous performance of their duties to\r\nthemselves and to the people in this respect.\r\n\r\nIn reducing the revenue to the wants of the Government your particular\r\nattention is invited to those articles which constitute the necessaries\r\nof life. The duty on salt was laid as a war tax, and was no doubt\r\ncontinued to assist in providing for the payment of the war debt.\r\nThere is no article the release of which from taxation would be felt so\r\ngenerally and so beneficially. To this may be added all kinds of fuel\r\nand provisions. Justice and benevolence unite in favor of releasing the\r\npoor of our cities from burdens which are not necessary to the support\r\nof our Government and tend only to increase the wants of the destitute.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nand the accompanying documents that the Bank of the United States has\r\nmade no payment on account of the stock held by the Government in that\r\ninstitution, although urged to pay any portion which might suit its\r\nconvenience, and that it has given no information when payment may be\r\nexpected. Nor, although repeatedly requested, has it furnished the\r\ninformation in relation to its condition which Congress authorized the\r\nSecretary to collect at their last session. Such measures as are within\r\nthe power of the Executive have been taken to ascertain the value of\r\nthe stock and procure the payment as early as possible.\r\n\r\nThe conduct and present condition of that bank and the great amount\r\nof capital vested in it by the United States require your careful\r\nattention. Its charter expired on the 3d day of March last, and it has\r\nnow no power but that given in the twenty-first section, \"to use the\r\ncorporate name, style, and capacity for the purpose of suits for the\r\nfinal settlement and liquidation of the affairs and accounts of the\r\ncorporation, and for the sale and disposition of their estate--real,\r\npersonal, and mixed--but not for any other purpose or in any other\r\nmanner whatsoever, nor for a period exceeding two years after the\r\nexpiration of the said term of incorporation.\" Before the expiration\r\nof the charter the stockholders of the bank obtained an act of\r\nincorporation from the legislature of Pennsylvania, excluding only the\r\nUnited States. Instead of proceeding to wind up their concerns and pay\r\nover to the United States the amount due on account of the stock held\r\nby them, the president and directors of the old bank appear to have\r\ntransferred the books, papers, notes, obligations, and most or all of\r\nits property to this new corporation, which entered upon business as\r\na continuation of the old concern. Amongst other acts of questionable\r\nvalidity, the notes of the expired corporation are known to have been\r\nused as its own and again put in circulation. That the old bank had no\r\nright to issue or reissue its notes after the expiration of its charter\r\ncan not be denied, and that it could not confer any such right on its\r\nsubstitute any more than exercise it itself is equally plain. In law and\r\nhonesty the notes of the bank in circulation at the expiration of its\r\ncharter should have been called in by public advertisement, paid up as\r\npresented, and, together with those on hand, canceled and destroyed.\r\nTheir reissue is sanctioned by no law and warranted by no necessity.\r\nIf the United States be responsible in their stock for the payment of\r\nthese notes, their reissue by the new corporation for their own profit\r\nis a fraud on the Government. If the United States is not responsible,\r\nthen there is no legal responsibility in any quarter, and it is a fraud\r\non the country. They are the redeemed notes of a dissolved partnership,\r\nbut, contrary to the wishes of the retiring partner and without his\r\nconsent, are again reissued and circulated.\r\n\r\nIt is the high and peculiar duty of Congress to decide whether any\r\nfurther legislation be necessary for the security of the large amount of\r\npublic property now held and in use by the new bank, and for vindicating\r\nthe rights of the Government and compelling a speedy and honest\r\nsettlement with all the creditors of the old bank, public and private,\r\nor whether the subject shall be left to the power now possessed by the\r\nExecutive and judiciary. It remains to be seen whether the persons\r\nwho as managers of the old bank undertook to control the Government,\r\nretained the public dividends, shut their doors upon a committee of\r\nthe House of Representatives, and filled the country with panic to\r\naccomplish their own sinister objects may now as managers of a new bank\r\ncontinue with impunity to flood the country with a spurious currency,\r\nuse the seven millions of Government stock for their own profit, and\r\nrefuse to the United States all information as to the present condition\r\nof their own property and the prospect of recovering it into their\r\nown possession.\r\n\r\nThe lessons taught by the Bank of the United States can not well be lost\r\nupon the American people. They will take care never again to place so\r\ntremendous a power in irresponsible hands, and it will be fortunate if\r\nthey seriously consider the consequences which are likely to result on a\r\nsmaller scale from the facility with which corporate powers are granted\r\nby their State governments.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the law of the last session regulating the deposit\r\nbanks operates onerously and unjustly upon them in many respects, and\r\nit is hoped that Congress, on proper representations, will adopt the\r\nmodifications which are necessary to prevent this consequence.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War _ad interim_ and the accompanying\r\ndocuments, all which are herewith laid before you, will give you a full\r\nview of the diversified and important operations of that Department\r\nduring the past year.\r\n\r\nThe military movements rendered necessary by the aggressions of the\r\nhostile portions of the Seminole and Creek tribes of Indians, and by\r\nother circumstances, have required the active employment of nearly our\r\nwhole regular force, including the Marine Corps, and of large bodies of\r\nmilitia and volunteers. With all these events so far as they were known\r\nat the seat of Government before the termination of your last session\r\nyou are already acquainted, and it is therefore only needful in this\r\nplace to lay before you a brief summary of what has since occurred.\r\n\r\nThe war with the Seminoles during the summer was on our part chiefly\r\nconfined to the protection of our frontier settlements from the\r\nincursions of the enemy, and, as a necessary and important means for the\r\naccomplishment of that end, to the maintenance of the posts previously\r\nestablished. In the course of this duty several actions took place,\r\nin which the bravery and discipline of both officers and men were\r\nconspicuously displayed, and which I have deemed it proper to notice\r\nin respect to the former by the granting of brevet rank for gallant\r\nservices in the field. But as the force of the Indians was not so far\r\nweakened by these partial successes as to lead them to submit, and\r\nas their savage inroads were frequently repeated, early measures were\r\ntaken for placing at the disposal of Governor Call, who as commander in\r\nchief of the Territorial militia had been temporarily invested with the\r\ncommand, an ample force for the purpose of resuming offensive operations\r\nin the most efficient manner so soon as the season should permit.\r\nMajor-General Jesup was also directed, on the conclusion of his duties\r\nin the Creek country, to repair to Florida and assume the command.\r\n\r\nThe result of the first movement made by the forces under the direction\r\nof Governor Call in October last, as detailed in the accompanying\r\npapers, excited much surprise and disappointment. A full explanation has\r\nbeen required of the causes which led to the failure of that movement,\r\nbut has not yet been received. In the meantime, as it was feared that\r\nthe health of Governor Call, who was understood to have suffered much\r\nfrom sickness, might not be adequate to the crisis, and as Major-General\r\nJesup was known to have reached Florida, that officer was directed to\r\nassume the command, and to prosecute all needful operations with the\r\nutmost promptitude and vigor. From the force at his disposal and the\r\ndispositions he has made and is instructed to make, and from the very\r\nefficient measures which it is since ascertained have been taken by\r\nGovernor Call, there is reason to hope that they will soon be enabled to\r\nreduce the enemy to subjection. In the meantime, as you will perceive\r\nfrom the report of the Secretary, there is urgent necessity for further\r\nappropriations to suppress these hostilities.\r\n\r\nHappily for the interests of humanity, the hostilities with the Creeks\r\nwere brought to a close soon after your adjournment, without that\r\neffusion of blood which at one time was apprehended as inevitable.\r\nThe unconditional submission of the hostile party was followed by their\r\nspeedy removal to the country assigned them west of the Mississippi.\r\nThe inquiry as to alleged frauds in the purchase of the reservations\r\nof these Indians and the causes of their hostilities, requested by the\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives of the 1st of July last\r\nto be made by the President, is now going on through the agency of\r\ncommissioners appointed for that purpose. Their report may be expected\r\nduring your present session.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties apprehended in the Cherokee country have been\r\nprevented, and the peace and safety of that region and its vicinity\r\neffectually secured, by the timely measures taken by the War Department,\r\nand still continued.\r\n\r\nThe discretionary authority given to General Gaines to cross the Sabine\r\nand to occupy a position as far west as Nacogdoches, in case he should\r\ndeem such a step necessary to the protection of the frontier and to the\r\nfulfillment of the stipulations contained in our treaty with Mexico, and\r\nthe movement subsequently made by that officer have been alluded to in a\r\nformer part of this message. At the date of the latest intelligence from\r\nNacogdoches our troops were yet at that station, but the officer who has\r\nsucceeded General Gaines has recently been advised that from the facts\r\nknown at the seat of Government there would seem to be no adequate\r\ncause for any longer maintaining that position, and he was accordingly\r\ninstructed, in case the troops were not already withdrawn under the\r\ndiscretionary powers before possessed by him, to give the requisite\r\norders for that purpose on the receipt of the instructions, unless he\r\nshall then have in his possession such information as shall satisfy him\r\nthat the maintenance of the post is essential to the protection of our\r\nfrontiers and to the due execution of our treaty stipulations, as\r\npreviously explained to him.\r\n\r\nWhilst the necessities existing during the present year for the service\r\nof militia and volunteers have furnished new proofs of the patriotism of\r\nour fellow-citizens, they have also strongly illustrated the importance\r\nof an increase in the rank and file of the Regular Army. The views\r\nof this subject submitted by the Secretary of War in his report meet\r\nmy entire concurrence, and are earnestly commended to the deliberate\r\nattention of Congress. In this connection it is also proper to remind\r\nyou that the defects in our present militia system are every day\r\nrendered more apparent. The duty of making further provision by law\r\nfor organizing, arming, and disciplining this arm of defense has been\r\nso repeatedly presented to Congress by myself and my predecessors that\r\nI deem it sufficient on this occasion to refer to the last annual\r\nmessage and to former Executive communications in which the subject\r\nhas been discussed.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the reports of the officers charged with mustering into\r\nservice the volunteers called for under the act of Congress of the last\r\nsession that more presented themselves at the place of rendezvous in\r\nTennessee than were sufficient to meet the requisition which had been\r\nmade by the Secretary of War upon the governor of that State. This was\r\noccasioned by the omission of the governor to apportion the requisition\r\nto the different regiments of militia so as to obtain the proper number\r\nof troops and no more. It seems but just to the patriotic citizens who\r\nrepaired to the general rendezvous under circumstances authorizing them\r\nto believe that their services were needed and would be accepted that\r\nthe expenses incurred by them while absent from their homes should be\r\npaid by the Government. I accordingly recommend that a law to this\r\neffect be passed by Congress, giving them a compensation which will\r\ncover their expenses on the march to and from the place of rendezvous\r\nand while there; in connection with which it will also be proper to make\r\nprovision for such other equitable claims growing out of the service of\r\nthe militia as may not be embraced in the existing laws.\r\n\r\nOn the unexpected breaking out of hostilities in Florida, Alabama,\r\nand Georgia it became necessary in some cases to take the property\r\nof individuals for public use. Provision should be made by law for\r\nindemnifying the owners; and I would also respectfully suggest whether\r\nsome provision may not be made, consistently with the principles of our\r\nGovernment, for the relief of the sufferers by Indian depredations or\r\nby the operations of our own troops.\r\n\r\nNo time was lost after the making of the requisite appropriations\r\nin resuming the great national work of completing the unfinished\r\nfortifications on our seaboard and of placing them in a proper state of\r\ndefense. In consequence, however, of the very late day at which those\r\nbills were passed, but little progress could be made during the season\r\nwhich has just closed. A very large amount of the moneys granted at your\r\nlast session accordingly remains unexpended; but as the work will be\r\nagain resumed at the earliest moment in the coming spring, the balance\r\nof the existing appropriations, and in several cases which will be\r\nlaid before you, with the proper estimates, further sums for the like\r\nobjects, may be usefully expended during the next year.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of an increase in the Engineer Corps and for a\r\nreorganization of the Topographical Corps, submitted to you in my last\r\nannual message, derive additional strength from the great embarrassments\r\nexperienced during the present year in those branches of the service,\r\nand under which they are now suffering. Several of the most important\r\nsurveys and constructions directed by recent laws have been suspended\r\nin consequence of the want of adequate force in these corps.\r\n\r\nThe like observations may be applied to the Ordnance Corps and to the\r\ngeneral staff, the operations of which as they are now organized must\r\neither be frequently interrupted or performed by officers taken from\r\nthe line of the Army, to the great prejudice of the service.\r\n\r\nFor a general view of the condition of the Military Academy and of other\r\nbranches of the military service not already noticed, as well as for\r\nfuller illustrations of those which have been mentioned, I refer you to\r\nthe accompanying documents, and among the various proposals contained\r\ntherein for legislative action I would particularly notice the\r\nsuggestion of the Secretary of War for the revision of the pay of the\r\nArmy as entitled to your favorable regard.\r\n\r\nThe national policy, founded alike in interest and in humanity, so long\r\nand so steadily pursued by this Government for the removal of the Indian\r\ntribes originally settled on this side of the Mississippi to the west of\r\nthat river, may be said to have been consummated by the conclusion of\r\nthe late treaty with the Cherokees. The measures taken in the execution\r\nof that treaty and in relation to our Indian affairs generally will\r\nfully appear by referring to the accompanying papers. Without dwelling\r\non the numerous and important topics embraced in them, I again invite\r\nyour attention to the importance of providing a well-digested and\r\ncomprehensive system for the protection, supervision, and improvement of\r\nthe various tribes now planted in the Indian country. The suggestions\r\nsubmitted by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and enforced by the\r\nSecretary, on this subject, and also in regard to the establishment of\r\nadditional military posts in the Indian country, are entitled to your\r\nprofound consideration. Both measures are necessary, for the double\r\npurpose of protecting the Indians from intestine war, and in other\r\nrespects complying with our engagements to them, and of securing our\r\nwestern frontier against incursions which otherwise will assuredly be\r\nmade on it. The best hopes of humanity in regard to the aboriginal race,\r\nthe welfare of our rapidly extending settlements, and the honor of the\r\nUnited States are all deeply involved in the relations existing between\r\nthis Government and the emigrating tribes. I trust, therefore, that the\r\nvarious matters submitted in the accompanying documents in respect to\r\nthose relations will receive your early and mature deliberation, and\r\nthat it may issue in the adoption of legislative measures adapted to\r\nthe circumstances and duties of the present crisis.\r\n\r\nYou are referred to the report of the Secretary of the Navy for a\r\nsatisfactory view of the operations of the Department under his charge\r\nduring the present year. In the construction of vessels at the different\r\nnavy-yards and in the employment of our ships and squadrons at sea that\r\nbranch of the service has been actively and usefully employed. While\r\nthe situation of our commercial interests in the West Indies required a\r\ngreater number than usual of armed vessels to be kept on that station,\r\nit is gratifying to perceive that the protection due to our commerce in\r\nother quarters of the world has not proved insufficient. Every effort\r\nhas been made to facilitate the equipment of the exploring expedition\r\nauthorized by the act of the last session, but all the preparation\r\nnecessary to enable it to sail has not yet been completed. No means\r\nwill be spared by the Government to fit out the expedition on a scale\r\ncorresponding with the liberal appropriations for the purpose and with\r\nthe elevated character of the objects which are to be effected by it.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to renew the recommendation made in my last annual message\r\nrespecting the enlistment of boys in our naval service, and to urge upon\r\nyour attention the necessity of further appropriations to increase the\r\nnumber of ships afloat and to enlarge generally the capacity and force\r\nof the Navy. The increase of our commerce and our position in regard\r\nto the other powers of the world will always make it our policy and\r\ninterest to cherish the great naval resources of our country.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General presents a gratifying picture of\r\nthe condition of the Post-Office Department. Its revenues for the year\r\nending the 30th June last were $3,398,455.19, showing an increase of\r\nrevenue over that of the preceding year of $404,878.53, or more than\r\n13 per cent. The expenditures for the same year were $2,755,623.76,\r\nexhibiting a surplus of $642,831.43. The Department has been redeemed\r\nfrom embarrassment and debt, has accumulated a surplus exceeding half a\r\nmillion of dollars, has largely extended and is preparing still further\r\nto extend the mail service, and recommends a reduction of postages equal\r\nto about 20 per cent. It is practicing upon the great principle which\r\nshould control every branch of our Government of rendering to the\r\npublic the greatest good possible with the least possible taxation\r\nto the people.\r\n\r\nThe scale of postages suggested by the Postmaster-General recommends\r\nitself, not only by the reduction it proposes, but by the simplicity\r\nof its arrangement, its conformity with the Federal currency, and the\r\nimprovement it will introduce into the accounts of the Department and\r\nits agents.\r\n\r\nYour particular attention is invited to the subject of mail contracts\r\nwith railroad companies. The present laws providing for the making of\r\ncontracts are based upon the presumption that competition among bidders\r\nwill secure the service at a fair price; but on most of the railroad\r\nlines there is no competition in that kind of transportation, and\r\nadvertising is therefore useless. No contract can now be made with\r\nthem except such as shall be negotiated before the time of offering or\r\nafterwards, and the power of the Postmaster-General to pay them high\r\nprices is practically without limitation. It would be a relief to him\r\nand no doubt would conduce to the public interest to prescribe by law\r\nsome equitable basis upon which such contracts shall rest, and restrict\r\nhim by a fixed rule of allowance. Under a liberal act of that sort he\r\nwould undoubtedly be able to secure the services of most of the railroad\r\ncompanies, and the interest of the Department would be thus advanced.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence between the people of the United States and the\r\nEuropean nations, and particularly with the British Islands, has become\r\nvery extensive, and requires the interposition of Congress to give it\r\nsecurity. No obstacle is perceived to an interchange of mails between\r\nNew York and Liverpool or other foreign ports, as proposed by the\r\nPostmaster-General. On the contrary, it promises, by the security it\r\nwill afford, to facilitate commercial transactions and give rise to an\r\nenlarged intercourse among the people of different nations, which can\r\nnot but have a happy effect. Through the city of New York most of\r\nthe correspondence between the Canadas and Europe is now carried on,\r\nand urgent representations have been received from the head of the\r\nprovincial post-office asking the interposition of the United States\r\nto guard it from the accidents and losses to which it is now subjected.\r\nSome legislation appears to be called for as well by our own interest\r\nas by comity to the adjoining British provinces.\r\n\r\nThe expediency of providing a fireproof building for the important books\r\nand papers of the Post-Office Department is worthy of consideration. In\r\nthe present condition of our Treasury it is neither necessary nor wise\r\nto leave essential public interests exposed to so much danger when they\r\ncan so readily be made secure. There are weighty considerations in the\r\nlocation of a new building for that Department in favor of placing it\r\nnear the other executive buildings.\r\n\r\nThe important subjects of a survey of the coast and the manufacture of\r\na standard of weights and measures for the different custom-houses have\r\nbeen in progress for some years under the general direction of the\r\nExecutive and the immediate superintendence of a gentleman possessing\r\nhigh scientific attainments. At the last session of Congress the making\r\nof a set of weights and measures for each State in the Union was added\r\nto the others by a joint resolution.\r\n\r\nThe care and correspondence as to all these subjects have been devolved\r\non the Treasury Department during the last year. A special report from\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury will soon be communicated to Congress,\r\nwhich will show what has been accomplished as to the whole, the number\r\nand compensation of the persons now employed in these duties, and the\r\nprogress expected to be made during the ensuing year, with a copy of the\r\nvarious correspondence deemed necessary to throw light on the subjects\r\nwhich seem to require additional legislation. Claims have been made for\r\nretrospective allowances in behalf of the superintendent and some of\r\nhis assistants, which I did not feel justified in granting. Other\r\nclaims have been made for large increases in compensation, which, under\r\nall the circumstances of the several cases, I declined making without\r\nthe express sanction of Congress. In order to obtain that sanction\r\nthe subject was at the last session, on my suggestion and by request\r\nof the immediate superintendent, submitted by the Treasury Department\r\nto the Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives. But no\r\nlegislative action having taken place, the early attention of Congress\r\nis now invited to the enactment of some express and detailed provisions\r\nin relation to the various claims made for the past, and to the\r\ncompensation and allowances deemed proper for the future.\r\n\r\nIt is further respectfully recommended that, such being the\r\ninconvenience of attention to these duties by the Chief Magistrate,\r\nand such the great pressure of business on the Treasury Department,\r\nthe general supervision of the coast survey and the completion of the\r\nweights and measures, if the works are kept united, should be devolved\r\non a board of officers organized specially for that purpose, or on the\r\nNavy Board attached to the Navy Department.\r\n\r\nAll my experience and reflection confirm the conviction I have so\r\noften expressed to Congress in favor of an amendment of the Constitution\r\nwhich will prevent in any event the election of the President and\r\nVice-President of the United States devolving on the House of\r\nRepresentatives and the Senate, and I therefore beg leave again to\r\nsolicit your attention to the subject. There were various other\r\nsuggestions in my last annual message not acted upon, particularly\r\nthat relating to the want of uniformity in the laws of the District\r\nof Columbia, that are deemed worthy of your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this paper I think it due to the various Executive\r\nDepartments to bear testimony to their prosperous condition and to the\r\nability and integrity with which they have been conducted. It has been\r\nmy aim to enforce in all of them a vigilant and faithful discharge of\r\nthe public business, and it is gratifying to me to believe that there\r\nis no just cause of complaint from any quarter at the manner in which\r\nthey have fulfilled the objects of their creation.\r\n\r\nHaving now finished the observations deemed proper on this the last\r\noccasion I shall have of communicating with the two Houses of Congress\r\nat their meeting, I can not omit an expression of the gratitude which\r\nis due to the great body of my fellow-citizens, in whose partiality and\r\nindulgence I have found encouragement and support in the many difficult\r\nand trying scenes through which it has been my lot to pass during my\r\npublic career. Though deeply sensible that my exertions have not been\r\ncrowned with a success corresponding to the degree of favor bestowed\r\nupon me, I am sure that they will be considered as having been\r\ndirected by an earnest desire to promote the good of my country, and I\r\nam consoled by the persuasion that whatever errors have been committed\r\nwill find a corrective in the intelligence and patriotism of those who\r\nwill succeed us. All that has occurred during my Administration is\r\ncalculated to inspire me with increased confidence in the stability of\r\nour institutions; and should I be spared to enter upon that retirement\r\nwhich is so suitable to my age and infirm health and so much desired\r\nby me in other respects, I shall not cease to invoke that beneficent\r\nBeing to whose providence we are already so signally indebted for the\r\ncontinuance of His blessings on our beloved country.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.--_Statement of distribution of surplus revenue of $30,000,000 among\r\nthe several States, agreeably to the number of electoral votes for\r\nPresident and according to the constitutional mode of direct taxation\r\nby representative population, and the difference arising from those two\r\nmodes of distribution, as per census of 1830_.\r\n\r\n\r\n   S  Representative Elect- Share      Share      Difference  Difference\r\n   t  population     oral   according  according  in favor    in favor\r\n   a                 vote   to system  to         of direct   of\r\n   t                        of direct  electoral  tax         electoral\r\n   e                        taxation   vote       mode        vote mode\r\n\r\n  ME    399,454      10    $999,371   $1,020,408               $21,037\r\n  NH    269,327       7     673,813      714,286                40,473\r\n  MA    610,408      14   1,527,144    1,428,571    $98,573\r\n  RI     97,192       4     243,159      408,163               165,004\r\n  CT    297,665       8     744,711      816,327                71,616\r\n  VT    280,652       7     702,147      714,286                12,139\r\n  NY  1,918,578      42   4,799,978    4,285,714    514,264\r\n  NJ    319,921       8     800,392      816,427                15,935\r\n  PA  1,348,072      30   3,372,662    3,061,225    311,437\r\n  DE     75,431       3     188,716      306,122               117,406\r\n  MD    405,842      10   1,015,352    1,020,408                 5,056\r\n  VA  1,023,502      23   2,560 640    2,346,939    213,701\r\n  NC    639,747      15   1,600,546    1,530,612     69,934\r\n  SC    455,025      11   1,138,400    1,122,449     15,951\r\n  GA    429,811      11   1,075,319    1,122,449                47,130\r\n  AL    262,307       7     656,751      714,286                57,535\r\n  MS    110,357       4     276,096      408,163               132,067\r\n  LA    171,904       5     430,076      510,204                80,128\r\n  TN    625,263      15   1,564,309    1,530,612     33,697\r\n  KY    621,832      15   1,555,725    1,530,612     25,113\r\n  OH    937,901      21   2,346,479    2,142,858    203,621\r\n  IN    343,030       9     858,206      918,368                60,162\r\n  IL    157,146       5     393,154      510,204               117,050\r\n  MO    130,419       4     326,288      408,163                81,875\r\n  AR     28,557       3      71,445      306,122               234,677\r\n  MI     31,625       3      79,121      306,102               227,001\r\n  Total\r\n     11,991,168     294  30,000,000   30,000,000  1,486,291  1,486,291\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: State names abbreviated to reduce column width.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 6, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to Congress copies of my correspondence with Mrs.\r\nMadison, produced by the resolution adopted at the last session by the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives on the decease of her venerated\r\nhusband. The occasion seems to be appropriate to present a letter from\r\nher on the subject of the publication of a work of great political\r\ninterest and ability, carefully prepared by Mr. Madison's own hand,\r\nunder circumstances that give it claims to be considered as little\r\nless than official.\r\n\r\nCongress has already, at considerable expense, published in a\r\nvariety of forms the naked journals of the Revolutionary Congress\r\nand of the Convention that formed the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. I am persuaded that the work of Mr. Madison, considering the\r\nauthor, the subject-matter of it, and the circumstances under which\r\nit was prepared--long withheld from the public, as it has been,\r\nby those motives of personal kindness and delicacy that gave tone\r\nto his intercourse with his fellow-men, until he and all who had\r\nbeen participators with him in the scenes he describes have passed\r\naway--well deserves to become the property of the nation, and can not\r\nfail, if published and disseminated at the public charge, to confer\r\nthe most important of all benefits on the present and all succeeding\r\ngenerations--accurate knowledge of the principles of their Government\r\nand the circumstances under which they were recommended and embodied\r\nin the Constitution for adoption.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_July 9, 1836_.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State has the honor to report to the President that\r\nthere is no resolution of Congress on the death of Mr. Madison on\r\nfile in the Department of State. By application at the offices of the\r\nSecretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House of Representatives the\r\ninclosed certified copy of a set of resolutions has been procured.\r\nThese resolutions, being joint, should have been enrolled, signed\r\nby the presiding officers of the two Houses, and submitted for the\r\nExecutive approbation. By referring to the proceedings on the death\r\nof General Washington such a course appears to have been thought\r\nrequisite, but in this case it has been deemed unnecessary or has\r\nbeen omitted accidentally. The value of the public expression of\r\nsympathy would be so much diminished by postponement to the next\r\nsession that the Secretary has thought it best to present the papers,\r\nincomplete as they are, as the basis of such a letter as the President\r\nmay think proper to direct to Mrs. Madison.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 9, 1836_.\r\n\r\nMrs. D.P. MADISON,\r\n\r\n_Montpelier, Va_.\r\n\r\nMADAM: It appearing to have been the intention of Congress to make me\r\nthe organ of assuring you of the profound respect entertained by both\r\nits branches for your person and character, and of their sincere\r\ncondolence in the late afflicting dispensation of Providence, which has\r\nat once deprived you of a beloved companion and your country of one\r\nof its most valued citizens, I perform that duty by transmitting the\r\ndocuments herewith inclosed.\r\n\r\nNo expression of my own sensibility at the loss sustained by yourself\r\nand the nation could add to the consolation to be derived from these\r\nhigh evidences of the public sympathy. Be assured, madam, that there is\r\nnot one of your countrymen who feels more poignantly the stroke which\r\nhas fallen upon you or who will cherish with a more endearing constancy\r\nthe memory of the virtues, the services, and the purity of the\r\nillustrious man whose glorious and patriotic life has been just\r\nterminated by a tranquil death.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, madam, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States having communicated to the two\r\nHouses of Congress the melancholy intelligence of the death of their\r\nillustrious and beloved fellow-citizen, James Madison, of Virginia,\r\nlate President of the United States, and the two Houses sharing in\r\nthe general grief which this distressing event must produce:\r\n\r\n_Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America in Congress assembled_, That the chairs\r\nof the President of the Senate and of the Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives be shrouded in black during the present session,\r\nand that the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and the members and officers of both Houses wear\r\nthe usual badge of mourning for thirty days.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That it be recommended to the people of the United States\r\nto wear crape on the left arm, as mourning, for thirty days.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the President of the United States be requested to\r\ntransmit a copy of these resolutions to Mrs. Madison, and to assure her\r\nof the profound respect of the two Houses of Congress for her person and\r\ncharacter and of their sincere condolence on the late afflicting\r\ndispensation of Providence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTPELIER, _August 20, 1836_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nI received, sir, in due time, your letter conveying to me the\r\nresolutions Congress were pleased to adopt on the occasion of the death\r\nof my beloved husband--a communication made the more grateful by the\r\nkind expression of your sympathy which it contained.\r\n\r\nThe high and just estimation of my husband by my countrymen and friends\r\nand their generous participation in the sorrow occasioned by our\r\nirretrievable loss, expressed through their supreme authorities and\r\notherwise, are the only solace of which my heart is susceptible on the\r\ndeparture of him who had never lost sight of that consistency, symmetry,\r\nand beauty of character in all its parts which secured to him the love\r\nand admiration of his country, and which must ever be the subject of\r\npeculiar and tender reverence to one whose happiness was derived from\r\ntheir daily and constant exercise.\r\n\r\nThe best return I can make for the sympathy of my country is to fulfill\r\nthe sacred trust his confidence reposed in me, that of placing before\r\nit and the world what his pen prepared for their use--a legacy the\r\nimportance of which is deeply impressed on my mind.\r\n\r\nWith great respect,\r\n\r\nD.P. MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTPELIER, _November 15, 1836_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: The will of my late husband, James Madison, contains the following\r\nprovision:\r\n\r\n\"Considering the peculiarity and magnitude of the occasion which\r\nproduced the Convention at Philadelphia in 1787, the characters who\r\ncomposed it, the Constitution which resulted from their deliberations,\r\nits effects during a trial of so many years on the prosperity of the\r\npeople living under it, and the interest it has inspired among the\r\nfriends of free government, it is not an unreasonable inference that a\r\ncareful and extended report of the proceedings and discussions of that\r\nbody, which were with closed doors, by a member who was constant in his\r\nattendance, will be particularly gratifying to the people of the United\r\nStates and to all who take an interest in the progress of political\r\nscience and the cause of true liberty.\"\r\n\r\nThis provision bears evidence of the value he set on his report of the\r\ndebates in the Convention, and he has charged legacies on them alone to\r\nthe amount of $1,200 for the benefit of literary institutions and for\r\nbenevolent purposes, leaving the residuary net proceeds for the use of\r\nhis widow.\r\n\r\nIn a paper written by him, and which it is proposed to annex as a\r\npreface to the Debates, he traces the formation of confederacies and of\r\nthe Articles of Confederation, its defects which caused and the steps\r\nwhich led to the Convention, his reasons for taking the debates and the\r\nmanner in which he executed the task, and his opinion of the framers of\r\nthe Constitution. From this I extract his description of the manner in\r\nwhich they were taken, as it guarantees their fullness and accuracy:\r\n\r\n\"In pursuance of the task I had assumed, I chose a seat in front of the\r\npresiding member, with the other members on my right and left hands.\r\nIn this favorable position for hearing all that passed I noted down,\r\nin terms legible and in abbreviations and marks intelligible to myself,\r\nwhat was read from the chair or spoken by the members, and losing not\r\na moment unnecessarily between the adjournment and reassembling of\r\nthe Convention, I was enabled to write out my daily notes during the\r\nsession, or within a few finishing days after its close, in the extent\r\nand form preserved in my own hand on my files.\r\n\r\n\"In the labor and correctness of this I was not a little aided by\r\npractice and by a familiarity with the style and the train of\r\nobservation and reasoning which characterized the principal speakers.\r\nIt happened also that I was not absent a single day, nor more than the\r\ncasual fraction of an hour in any day, so that I could not have lost\r\na single speech, unless a very short one.\"\r\n\r\nHowever prevailing the restraint which veiled during the life of Mr.\r\nMadison this record of the creation of our Constitution, the grave,\r\nwhich has closed over all those who participated in its formation, has\r\nseparated their acts from all that is personal to him or to them. His\r\nanxiety for their early publicity after this was removed may be inferred\r\nfrom his having them transcribed and revised by himself; and, it may be\r\nadded, the known wishes of his illustrious friend Thomas Jefferson and\r\nother distinguished patriots, the important light they would shed for\r\npresent as well as future usefulness, besides my desire to fulfill\r\nthe pecuniary obligations imposed by his will, urged their appearance\r\nwithout awaiting the preparation of his other works, and early measures\r\nwere accordingly adopted by me to ascertain from publishers in various\r\nparts of the Union the terms on which their publication could be\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nIt was also intended to publish with these debates those taken by him in\r\nthe Congress of the Confederation in 1782, 1783, and 1787, of which he\r\nwas then a member, and selections made by himself and prepared under\r\nhis eye from his letters narrating the proceedings of that body during\r\nthe periods of his service in it, prefixing the debates in 1776 on the\r\nDeclaration of Independence by Thomas Jefferson so as to embody all the\r\nmemorials in that shape known to exist. This exposé of the situation of\r\nthe country under the Confederation and the defects of the old system of\r\ngovernment evidenced in the proceedings under it seem to convey such\r\npreceding information as should accompany the debates on the formation\r\nof the Constitution by which it was superseded.\r\n\r\nThe proposals which have been received, so far from corresponding with\r\nthe expectations of Mr. Madison when he charged the first of these works\r\nwith those legacies, have evidenced that their publication could not be\r\nengaged in by me without advances of funds and involving of risks which\r\nI am not in a situation to make or incur.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, I have been induced to submit for your\r\nconsideration whether the publication of these debates be a matter of\r\nsufficient interest to the people of the United States to deserve to be\r\nbrought to the notice of Congress; and should such be the estimation of\r\nthe utility of these works by the representatives of the nation as to\r\ninduce them to relieve me individually from the obstacles which impede\r\nit, their general circulation will be insured and the people be\r\nremunerated by its more economical distribution among them.\r\n\r\nWith high respect and consideration,\r\n\r\nD.P. MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 6, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a report from the Commissioner of the Public\r\nBuildings, showing the progress made in the construction of the public\r\nbuildings which by the act of the 4th of July last the President was\r\nauthorized to cause to be erected.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 20, 1836.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: Herewith I transmit a report of the Postmaster-General, and\r\nrecommend the passage of such laws and the making of such appropriations\r\nas may be necessary to carry into effect the measures adopted by him for\r\nresuming the business of the Department under his charge and securing\r\nthe public property in the old Post-Office building.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that the building procured for the temporary use of the\r\nDepartment is far from being fireproof, and that the valuable books and\r\npapers saved from the recent conflagration will there be exposed to\r\nsimilar dangers. I therefore feel it my duty to recommend an immediate\r\nappropriation for the construction of a fireproof General Post-Office,\r\nthat the materials may be obtained within the present winter and the\r\nbuildings erected as rapidly as practicable.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_December 20, 1836_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: On the morning of the 15th instant I performed the painful duty\r\nof reporting to you orally the destruction of the General Post-Office\r\nbuilding by fire, and received your instructions to inquire into the\r\ncause and extent of the calamity, for the purpose of enabling you to\r\nmake a communication to Congress.\r\n\r\nA few hours afterwards I received, through the chairman of the Committee\r\non the Post-Office and Post-Roads of the House of Representatives, an\r\nofficial copy of a resolution adopted by that House, instructing the\r\ncommittee to institute a similar inquiry, and the chairman asked for\r\nsuch information as it was in my power to give. The investigation\r\ndirected by you was thus rendered unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe corporation of the city of Washington with honorable promptitude\r\noffered the Department the use of the west wing of the City Hall, now\r\noccupied by the mayor and councils and their officers and the officers\r\nof the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company. The proprietors of the medical\r\ncollege also tendered the use of their building on E street, and offers\r\nwere made of several other buildings in the central parts of the city.\r\nAn examination was made of such as promise by their magnitude to afford\r\nsufficient room for the force employed in the Department, but none\r\nwere found equal in the commodiousness of their interior structure and\r\nabundant room to Fuller's Hotel, opposite the buildings occupied by\r\nthe Treasury Department on Pennsylvania avenue. That building has been\r\nobtained on terms which the accompanying papers (marked 1 and 2) will\r\nfully exhibit. The business of the Department will be immediately\r\nresumed in that building.\r\n\r\nThe agreement with Mr. Fuller will make necessary an immediate\r\nappropriation by Congress, and upon that body will devolve also the duty\r\nof providing for the payment of the rent, if they shall approve of the\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime steps have been taken to secure all that is valuable in\r\nthe ruins of the Post-Office building, and to protect from the weather\r\nthe walls of so much of it as was occupied by the General Post-Office\r\nwhich stand firm.\r\n\r\nThe Department has no fund at command out of which the services\r\nnecessary in the accomplishment of these objects can be paid for, nor\r\nhas it the means to replace the furniture which has been lost and must\r\nbe immediately obtained to enable the clerks to proceed with their\r\ncurrent business.\r\n\r\nThese facts I deem it my duty to report to you, that you may recommend\r\nto Congress such measures thereupon as you may deem expedient.\r\n\r\nWith the highest respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nAMOS KENDALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 20, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration and action of the Senate,\r\ntreaties concluded with the Ioways and Sacs of Missouri, with the Sioux,\r\nwith the Sacs and Foxes, and with the Otoes and Missourias and Omahas,\r\nby which they have relinquished their rights in the lands lying between\r\nthe State of Missouri and the Missouri River, ceded in the first article\r\nof the treaty with them of July 15, 1830.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 20, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for their consideration in reference\r\nto its ratification, a treaty of peace and friendship between the United\r\nStates of America and the Emperor of Morocco, concluded at Meccanez on\r\nthe 16th of September, 1836, with a report of the Secretary of State and\r\nthe documents therein mentioned.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 21, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nDuring the last session information was given to Congress by the\r\nExecutive that measures had been taken to ascertain \"the political,\r\nmilitary, and civil condition of Texas.\" I now submit for your\r\nconsideration extracts from the report of the agent who had been\r\nappointed to collect it relative to the condition of that country.\r\n\r\nNo steps have been taken by the Executive toward the acknowledgment of\r\nthe independence of Texas, and the whole subject would have been left\r\nwithout further remark on the information now given to Congress were it\r\nnot that the two Houses at their last session, acting separately, passed\r\nresolutions \"that the independence of Texas ought to be acknowledged by\r\nthe United States whenever satisfactory information should be received\r\nthat it had in successful operation a civil government capable of\r\nperforming the duties and fulfilling the obligations of an independent\r\npower.\" This mark of interest in the question of the independence of\r\nTexas and indication of the views of Congress make it proper that I\r\nshould somewhat in detail present the considerations that have governed\r\nthe Executive in continuing to occupy the ground previously taken in\r\nthe contest between Mexico and Texas.\r\n\r\nThe acknowledgment of a new state as independent and entitled to a place\r\nin the family of nations is at all times an act of great delicacy and\r\nresponsibility, but more especially so when such state has forcibly\r\nseparated itself from another of which it had formed an integral part\r\nand which still claims dominion over it. A premature recognition under\r\nthese circumstances, if not looked upon as justifiable cause of war, is\r\nalways liable to be regarded as a proof of an unfriendly spirit to one\r\nof the contending parties. All questions relative to the government of\r\nforeign nations, whether of the Old or the New World, have been treated\r\nby the United States as questions of fact only, and our predecessors\r\nhave cautiously abstained from deciding upon them until the clearest\r\nevidence was in their possession to enable them not only to decide\r\ncorrectly, but to shield their decisions from every unworthy imputation.\r\nIn all the contests that have arisen out of the revolutions of France,\r\nout of the disputes relating to the crowns of Portugal and Spain, out of\r\nthe revolutionary movements of those Kingdoms, out of the separation of\r\nthe American possessions of both from the European Governments, and out\r\nof the numerous and constantly occurring struggles for dominion in\r\nSpanish America, so wisely consistent with our just principles has been\r\nthe action of our Government that we have under the most critical\r\ncircumstances avoided all censure and encountered no other evil than\r\nthat produced by a transient estrangement of good will in those against\r\nwhom we have been by force of evidence compelled to decide.\r\n\r\nIt has thus been made known to the world that the uniform policy and\r\npractice of the United States is to avoid all interference in disputes\r\nwhich merely relate to the internal government of other nations, and\r\neventually to recognize the authority of the prevailing party, without\r\nreference to our particular interests and views or to the merits of the\r\noriginal controversy. Public opinion here is so firmly established and\r\nwell understood in favor of this policy that no serious disagreement has\r\never arisen among ourselves in relation to it, although brought under\r\nreview in a variety of forms and at periods when the minds of the people\r\nwere greatly excited by the agitation of topics purely domestic in\r\ntheir character. Nor has any deliberate inquiry ever been instituted in\r\nCongress or in any of our legislative bodies as to whom belonged the\r\npower of originally recognizing a new State--a power the exercise of\r\nwhich is equivalent under some circumstances to a declaration of war; a\r\npower nowhere expressly delegated, and only granted in the Constitution\r\nas it is necessarily involved in some of the great powers given to\r\nCongress, in that given to the President and Senate to form treaties\r\nwith foreign powers and to appoint ambassadors and other public\r\nministers, and in that conferred upon the President to receive ministers\r\nfrom foreign nations.\r\n\r\nIn the preamble to the resolution of the House of Representatives\r\nit is distinctly intimated that the expediency of recognizing the\r\nindependence of Texas should be left to the decision of Congress.\r\nIn this view, on the ground of expediency, I am disposed to concur,\r\nand do not, therefore, consider it necessary to express any opinion\r\nas to the strict constitutional right of the Executive, either apart\r\nfrom or in conjunction with the Senate, over the subject. It is to be\r\npresumed that on no future occasion will a dispute arise, as none has\r\nheretofore occurred, between the Executive and Legislature in the\r\nexercise of the power of recognition. It will always be considered\r\nconsistent with the spirit of the Constitution, and most safe, that\r\nit should be exercised, when probably leading to war, with a previous\r\nunderstanding with that body by whom war can alone be declared, and by\r\nwhom all the provisions for sustaining its perils must be furnished.\r\nIts submission to Congress, which represents in one of its branches\r\nthe States of this Union and in the other the people of the United\r\nStates, where there may be reasonable ground to apprehend so grave\r\na consequence, would certainly afford the fullest satisfaction to our\r\nown country and a perfect guaranty to all other nations of the justice\r\nand prudence of the measures which might be adopted.\r\n\r\nIn making these suggestions it is not my purpose to relieve myself from\r\nthe responsibility of expressing my own opinions of the course the\r\ninterests of our country prescribe and its honor permits us to follow.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely to be imagined that a question of this character could be\r\npresented in relation to which it would be more difficult for the United\r\nStates to avoid exciting the suspicion and jealousy of other powers, and\r\nmaintain their established character for fair and impartial dealing. But\r\non this, as on every trying occasion, safety is to be found in a rigid\r\nadherence to principle.\r\n\r\nIn the contest between Spain and her revolted colonies we stood aloof\r\nand waited, not only until the ability of the new States to protect\r\nthemselves was fully established, but until the danger of their being\r\nagain subjugated had entirely passed away. Then, and not till then,\r\nwere they recognized. Such was our course in regard to Mexico herself.\r\nThe same policy was observed in all the disputes growing out of the\r\nseparation into distinct governments of those Spanish American States\r\nwho began or carried on the contest with the parent country united under\r\none form of government. We acknowledged the separate independence of\r\nNew Granada, of Venezuela, and of Ecuador only after their independent\r\nexistence was no longer a subject of dispute or was actually acquiesced\r\nin by those with whom they had been previously united. It is true that,\r\nwith regard to Texas, the civil authority of Mexico has been expelled,\r\nits invading army defeated, the chief of the Republic himself captured,\r\nand all present power to control the newly organized Government of Texas\r\nannihilated within its confines. But, on the other hand, there is, in\r\nappearance at least, an immense disparity of physical force on the side\r\nof Mexico. The Mexican Republic under another executive is rallying its\r\nforces under a new leader and menacing a fresh invasion to recover its\r\nlost dominion.\r\n\r\nUpon the issue of this threatened invasion the independence of Texas\r\nmay be considered as suspended, and were there nothing peculiar in the\r\nrelative situation of the United States and Texas our acknowledgment\r\nof its independence at such a crisis could scarcely be regarded as\r\nconsistent with that prudent reserve with which we have heretofore\r\nheld ourselves bound to treat all similar questions. But there are\r\ncircumstances in the relations of the two countries which require us to\r\nact on this occasion with even more than our wonted caution. Texas was\r\nonce claimed as a part of our property, and there are those among our\r\ncitizens who, always reluctant to abandon that claim, can not but regard\r\nwith solicitude the prospect of the reunion of the territory to this\r\ncountry. A large proportion of its civilized inhabitants are emigrants\r\nfrom the United States, speak the same language with ourselves, cherish\r\nthe same principles, political and religious, and are bound to many of\r\nour citizens by ties of friendship and kindred blood; and, more than\r\nall, it is known that the people of that country have instituted the\r\nsame form of government with our own, and have since the close of your\r\nlast session openly resolved, on the acknowledgment by us of their\r\nindependence, to seek admission into the Union as one of the Federal\r\nStates. This last circumstance is a matter of peculiar delicacy, and\r\nforces upon us considerations of the gravest character. The title of\r\nTexas to the territory she claims is identified with her independence.\r\nShe asks us to acknowledge that title to the territory, with an avowed\r\ndesign to treat immediately of its transfer to the United States. It\r\nbecomes us to beware of a too early movement, as it might subject us,\r\nhowever unjustly, to the imputation of seeking to establish the claim of\r\nour neighbors to a territory with a view to its subsequent acquisition\r\nby ourselves. Prudence, therefore, seems to dictate that we should\r\nstill stand aloof and maintain our present attitude, if not until\r\nMexico itself or one of the great foreign powers shall recognize the\r\nindependence of the new Government, at least until the lapse of time\r\nor the course of events shall have proved beyond cavil or dispute\r\nthe ability of the people of that country to maintain their separate\r\nsovereignty and to uphold the Government constituted by them. Neither\r\nof the contending parties can justly complain of this course. By\r\npursuing it we are but carrying out the long-established policy of\r\nour Government--a policy which has secured to us respect and influence\r\nabroad and inspired confidence at home.\r\n\r\nHaving thus discharged my duty, by presenting with simplicity and\r\ndirectness the views which after much reflection I have been led to\r\ntake of this important subject, I have only to add the expression of my\r\nconfidence that if Congress shall differ with me upon it their judgment\r\nwill be the result of dispassionate, prudent, and wise deliberation,\r\nwith the assurance that during the short time I shall continue connected\r\nwith the Government I shall promptly and cordially unite with you in\r\nsuch measures as may be deemed best fitted to increase the prosperity\r\nand perpetuate the peace of our favored country.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 26, 1836.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the Senate the report of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, giving all the information required by their resolution of the\r\n19th instant, calling for a list of the different appropriations which\r\nwill leave unexpended balances on the 1st day of January next.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 26, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI nominate William Gates, late major of the First Regiment of Artillery,\r\nfor reappointment in the Army, to be major in the Second Regiment of\r\nArtillery, to take rank from the 30th May, 1832, the date of his former\r\ncommission. This officer was stricken from the rolls of the Army by my\r\norder on the 7th of June last, upon a full consideration by me of the\r\nproceedings of a court of inquiry held at his request for the purpose of\r\ninvestigating his conduct during and subsequent to the attack on Fort\r\nBarnwell, at Volusia, in Florida, in April last, which court, after\r\nmature deliberation on the testimony before them, expressed the opinion\r\n\"that the effective force under the command of Major Gates was much\r\ngreater than the estimated force of the Indians who attacked him on the\r\nmorning of the 14th of April, 1836, and that therefore he was capable of\r\nmeeting the enemy in the field if necessary; also, that the bodies of\r\ntwo volunteers killed were improperly left exposed, and ought to have\r\nbeen brought in on the morning when they were killed, such exposure\r\nnecessarily operating injuriously on the garrison.\" He is now nominated\r\nfor a reappointment to the end that he may be brought to trial before\r\na court-martial, such a trial being solicited by him.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nBy the second section of the act \"to establish the northern boundary\r\nline of the State of Ohio, and to provide for the admission of the State\r\nof Michigan into the Union upon the conditions therein expressed,\"\r\napproved June 15, 1836, the constitution and State government which the\r\npeople of Michigan had formed for themselves was ratified and confirmed\r\nand the State of Michigan declared to be one of the United States of\r\nAmerica, and admitted into the Union upon an equal footing with the\r\noriginal States, but on the express condition that the said State should\r\nconsist of and have jurisdiction over all the territory included within\r\ncertain boundaries described in the act, and over none other. It was\r\nfurther enacted by the third section of the same law that, as a\r\ncompliance with the fundamental condition of admission, the boundaries\r\nof the State of Michigan, as thus described, declared, and established,\r\nshould \"receive the assent of a convention of delegates elected by the\r\npeople of said State for the sole purpose of giving the assent\" therein\r\nrequired; that as soon as such assent should be given the President of\r\nthe United States should announce the same by proclamation, and that\r\nthereupon, and without any further proceeding on the part of Congress,\r\nthe admission of the State into the Union as one of the United States\r\nof America should be considered as complete, and the Senators and\r\nRepresentatives in the Congress of the United States entitled to\r\ntake their seats without further delay.\r\n\r\nIn the month of November last I received a communication inclosing\r\nthe official proceedings of a convention assembled at Ann Arbor, in\r\nMichigan, on the 26th of September, 1836, all which (marked A) are\r\nherewith laid before you. It will be seen by these papers that the\r\nconvention therein referred to was elected by the people of Michigan\r\npursuant to an act of the State legislature passed on the 25th of July\r\nlast in consequence of the above-mentioned act of Congress, and that it\r\ndeclined giving its assent to the fundamental condition prescribed by\r\nCongress, and rejected the same.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th instant the accompanying paper (marked B), with its\r\ninclosure, containing the proceedings of a convention of delegates\r\nsubsequently elected and held in the State of Michigan, was presented\r\nto me. By these papers, which are also herewith submitted for your\r\nconsideration, it appears that elections were held in all the counties\r\nof the State, except two, on the 5th and 6th days of December instant,\r\nfor the purpose of electing a convention of delegates to give the\r\nassent required by Congress; that the delegates then elected assembled\r\nin convention on the 14th day of December instant, and that on the\r\nfollowing day the assent of the body to the fundamental condition\r\nabove stated was formally given.\r\n\r\nThis latter convention was not held or elected by virtue of any act of\r\nthe Territorial or State legislature; it originated from the people\r\nthemselves, and was chosen by them in pursuance of resolutions adopted\r\nin primary assemblies held in the respective counties. The act of\r\nCongress, however, does not prescribe by what authority the convention\r\nshall be ordered, or the time when or the manner in which it shall be\r\nchosen. Had these latter proceedings come to me during the recess of\r\nCongress, I should therefore have felt it my duty, on being satisfied\r\nthat they emanated from a convention of delegates elected in point\r\nof fact by the people of the State for the purpose required, to have\r\nissued my proclamation thereon as provided by law; but as the authority\r\nconferred on the President was evidently given to him under the\r\nexpectation that the assent of the convention might be laid before him\r\nduring the recess of Congress and to avoid the delay of a postponement\r\nuntil the meeting of that body, and as the circumstances which now\r\nattend the case are in other respects peculiar and such as could not\r\nhave been foreseen when the act of June 15, 1836, was passed, I deem\r\nit most agreeable to the intent of that law, and proper for other\r\nreasons, that the whole subject should be submitted to the decision of\r\nCongress. The importance of your early action upon it is too obvious\r\nto need remark.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 28, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 23d instant, I herewith transmit a report[22] from the Secretary\r\nof State, to whom the resolution was referred, containing all the\r\ninformation upon the subject which he is now able to communicate.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Relating to the bequest of James Smithson.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a report[23] of the Secretary of the Navy,\r\ncomplying with their resolution of the 24th of May, 1836.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 29, 1836.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Relating to the survey of the harbors south of the\r\nChesapeake.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 30, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of War\r\n_ad interim_, with certain accompanying papers[24] from the Engineer\r\nDepartment, required to complete the annual report from that\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Reports of the superintendents of the Cumberland road in\r\nIndiana and Illinois and of the improvement of the Ohio River above the\r\nFalls.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 30, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for your consideration and action, four treaties\r\nwith bands of Potawatamie Indians in Indiana, accompanied by a report\r\nfrom the War Department and sundry other papers.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 30, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for your consideration and action, a treaty with\r\nthe Menomonie tribe of Indians, accompanied by a report from the War\r\nDepartment.

The agent returned to the United States in\r\nSeptember last, and although the information collected by him is not as\r\nfull as could have been desired, yet it is sufficient to show that the\r\nprobability of an early execution of any of the projects which have been\r\nset on foot for the construction of the communication alluded to is not\r\nso great as to render it expedient to open a negotiation at present with\r\nany foreign government upon the subject.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 17, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI hereby submit to the House of Representatives certain communications\r\nfrom the Secretary of the Treasury and the attorney of the United States\r\nfor the District of Columbia. They relate to the difficulties which have\r\nbeen interposed under the existing laws in bringing to conviction and\r\npunishment the supposed incendiaries of the Treasury buildings in the\r\nyear 1833.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar circumstances of this case, so long concealed, and of\r\nthe flagrant frauds by persons disconnected with the Government, which\r\nwere still longer concealed, and to screen some of which forever was\r\nprobably a principal inducement to the burning of the buildings, lead\r\nme earnestly to recommend a revision of the laws on this subject.\r\nI do this with a wish not only to render the punishment hereafter more\r\nsevere for the wanton destruction of the public property, but to repeal\r\nentirely the statute of limitation in all criminal cases, except\r\nsmall misdemeanors, and in no event to allow a party to avail himself\r\nof its benefits during the period the commission of the crime was\r\nkept concealed or the persons on trial were not suspected of having\r\nperpetrated the offense.\r\n\r\nIt must be manifest to Congress that the exposed state of the public\r\nrecords here, without fireproof buildings, imperatively requires the\r\nmost ample remedies for their protection, and the greatest vigilance and\r\nfidelity in all officers, whether executive or judicial, in bringing to\r\ncondign punishment the real offenders.\r\n\r\nWithout these the public property is in that deplorable situation which\r\ndepends quite as much on accident and good fortune as the laws, for\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[The same message was sent to the Senate.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 17, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress herewith the copy of an act of the State of\r\nMissouri passed on the 16th ultimo, expressing the assent of that State\r\nto the several provisions of the act of Congress entitled \"An act to\r\nextend the western boundary of the State of Missouri to the Missouri\r\nRiver,\" approved June 7, 1836.

The chances of war, made inevitable by circumstances,\r\nreduced me to the condition of a prisoner, in which I still remain, as\r\nyou may have already learned. The disposition evinced by General Samuel\r\nHouston, the commander in chief of the Texan army, and by his successor,\r\nGeneral Thomas J. Rusk, for the termination of the war; the decision\r\nof the President and cabinet of Texas in favor of a proper compromise\r\nbetween the contending parties, and my own conviction, produced the\r\nconventions of which I send you copies inclosed, and the orders given\r\nby me to General Filisola, my second in command, to retire from the\r\nriver Brasos, where he was posted, to the other side of the river\r\nBravo del Norte.\r\n\r\nAs there was no doubt that General Filisola would religiously comply, as\r\nfar as concerned himself, the President and cabinet agreed that I should\r\nset off for Mexico, in order to fulfill the other engagements, and with\r\nthat intent I embarked on board the schooner _Invincible_, which was\r\nto carry me to the port of Vera Cruz. Unfortunately, however, some\r\nindiscreet persons raised a mob, which obliged the authorities to have\r\nme landed by force and brought back into strict captivity. This incident\r\nhas prevented me from going to Mexico, where I should otherwise have\r\narrived early in last month; and in consequence of it the Government of\r\nthat country, doubtless ignorant of what has occurred, has withdrawn the\r\ncommand of the army from General Filisola and has ordered his successor,\r\nGeneral Urrea, to continue its operations, in obedience to which order\r\nthat general is, according to the latest accounts, already at the river\r\nNueces. In vain have some reflecting and worthy men endeavored to\r\ndemonstrate the necessity of moderation and of my going to Mexico\r\naccording to the convention; but the excitement of the public mind has\r\nincreased with the return of the Mexican army to Texas. Such is the\r\nstate of things here at present. The continuation of the war and of its\r\ndisasters is therefore inevitable unless the voice of reason be heard in\r\nproper time from the mouth of some powerful individual. It appears to\r\nme that you, sir, have it in your power to perform this good office,\r\nby interfering in favor of the execution of the said convention, which\r\nshall be strictly fulfilled on my part. When I offered to treat with\r\nthis Government, I was convinced that it was useless for Mexico to\r\ncontinue the war. I have acquired exact information respecting this\r\ncountry which I did not possess four months ago. I have too much zeal\r\nfor the interests of my country to wish for anything which is not\r\ncompatible with them. Being always ready to sacrifice myself for its\r\nglory and advantage, I never would have hesitated to subject myself to\r\ntorments or death rather than consent to any compromise if Mexico could\r\nthereby have obtained the slightest benefit. I am firmly convinced that\r\nit is proper to terminate this question by political negotiation. That\r\nconviction alone determined me sincerely to agree to what has been\r\nstipulated, and in the same spirit I make to you this frank declaration.\r\nBe pleased, sir, to favor me by a like confidence on your part. Afford\r\nme the satisfaction of avoiding approaching evils and of contributing\r\nto that good which my heart advises. Let us enter into negotiations\r\nby which the friendship between your nation and the Mexican may be\r\nstrengthened, both being amicably engaged in giving being and stability\r\nto a people who are desirous of appearing in the political world, and\r\nwho, under the protection of the two nations, will attain its object\r\nwithin a few years.\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans are magnanimous when treated with consideration. I will\r\nclearly set before them the proper and humane reasons which require\r\nnoble and frank conduct on their part, and I doubt not that they will\r\nact thus as soon as they have been convinced.\r\n\r\nBy what I have here submitted you will see the sentiments which animate\r\nme, and with which I remain, your most humble and obedient servant,\r\n\r\nANTONIO LOPEZ DE SANTA ANNA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The President of the United States to the President of the Mexican\r\nRepublic_.\r\n\r\nHERMITAGE, _September 4, 1836_.\r\n\r\nGeneral ANTONIO LOPEZ DE SANTA ANNA.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the\r\n4th day of July last, which has been forwarded to me by General Samuel\r\nHouston, under cover of one from him, transmitted by an express from\r\nGeneral Gaines, who is in command of the United States forces on the\r\nTexan frontier. The great object of these communications appears to be\r\nto put an end to the disasters which necessarily attend the civil war\r\nnow raging in Texas, and asking the interposition of the United States\r\nin furthering so humane and desirable a purpose. That any well-intended\r\neffort of yours in aid of this object should have been defeated is\r\ncalculated to excite the regret of all who justly appreciate the\r\nblessings of peace, and who take an interest in the causes which\r\ncontribute to the prosperity of Mexico in her domestic as well as\r\nher foreign relations.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States is ever anxious to cultivate peace\r\nand friendship with all nations; but it proceeds on the principle that\r\nall nations have the right to alter, amend, or change their own\r\ngovernment as the sovereign power--the people--may direct. In this\r\nrespect it never interferes with the policy of other powers, nor can it\r\npermit any on the part of others with its internal policy. Consistently\r\nwith this principle, whatever we can do to restore peace between\r\ncontending nations or remove the causes of misunderstanding is\r\ncheerfully at the service of those who are willing to rely upon\r\nour good offices as a friend or mediator.\r\n\r\nIn reference, however, to the agreement which you, as the representative\r\nof Mexico, have made with Texas, and which invites the interposition of\r\nthe United States, you will at once see that we are forbidden by the\r\ncharacter of the communications made to us through the Mexican minister\r\nfrom considering it. That Government has notified us that as long as\r\nyou are a prisoner no act of yours will be regarded as binding by the\r\nMexican authorities. Under these circumstances it will be manifest to\r\nyou that good faith to Mexico, as well as the general principle to which\r\nI have adverted as forming the basis of our intercourse with all foreign\r\npowers, make it impossible for me to take any step like that you have\r\nanticipated. If, however, Mexico should signify her willingness to avail\r\nherself of our good offices in bringing about the desirable result you\r\nhave described, nothing could give me more pleasure than to devote my\r\nbest services to it. To be instrumental in terminating the evils of\r\ncivil war and in substituting in their stead the blessings of peace\r\nis a divine privilege. Every government and the people of all countries\r\nshould feel it their highest happiness to enjoy an opportunity of thus\r\nmanifesting their love of each other and their interest in the general\r\nprinciples which apply to them all as members of the common family\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nYour letter, and that of General Houston, commander in chief of\r\nthe Texan army, will be made the basis of an early interview with\r\nthe Mexican minister at Washington. They will hasten my return to\r\nWashington, to which place I will set out in a few days, expecting\r\nto reach it by the its of October. In the meantime I hope Mexico and\r\nTexas, feeling that war is the greatest of calamities, will pause before\r\nanother campaign is undertaken and can add to the number of those scenes\r\nof bloodshed which have already marked the progress of their contest and\r\nhave given so much pain to their Christian friends throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThis is sent under cover to General Houston, who will give it a safe\r\nconveyance to you.\r\n\r\nI am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 19, 1837.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a copy of the annual report of the Director of the\r\nMint, showing the operations of the institution during the past year and\r\nalso the progress made toward completion of the branch mints in North\r\nCarolina, Georgia, and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 20, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the act of Congress of the 3d of March, 1829, I\r\nherewith transmit to Congress the report of the board of inspectors of\r\nthe penitentiary of Washington, and beg leave to draw their attention to\r\nthe fact presented with the report, \"that the inspectors have received\r\nno compensation for their services for two years, viz, 1829 and 1830,\"\r\nand request that an appropriation be made for the same.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 21, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for your constitutional action, a report from the War\r\nDepartment, accompanied by a treaty with the Stockbridge and Munsee\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 21, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for your constitutional action, a report from the War\r\nDepartment, accompanied by a treaty with a portion of the New York\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 25, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 17th instant, I transmit a report[25] from the Secretary of State,\r\ntogether with the documents by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Relating to the condition of the political relations\r\nbetween the United States and Mexico, and to the condition of Texas.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 27, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith certain papers from the War Department, relative to\r\nthe improvement of Brunswick Harbor, Georgia.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 30, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House the copy of a letter addressed to\r\nme by the governor of the State of Maine on the 30th of June last,\r\ncommunicating sundry resolutions of the legislature of that State and\r\nclaiming the reimbursement of certain moneys paid to John and Phineas\r\nR.

The\r\nPresident begs leave to add that he trusts that all facilities will be\r\ngiven to this exploring expedition that Congress can bestow and the\r\nhonor of the nation demands.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Relating to the South Sea exploring expedition.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 6, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this session Congress was informed that our\r\nclaims upon Mexico had not been adjusted, but that notwithstanding the\r\nirritating effect upon her councils of the movements in Texas, I hoped,\r\nby great forbearance, to avoid the necessity of again bringing the\r\nsubject of them to your notice. That hope has been disappointed. Having\r\nin vain urged upon that Government the justice of those claims and my\r\nindispensable obligation to insist that there should be \"no further\r\ndelay in the acknowledgment, if not in the redress, of the injuries\r\ncomplained of,\" my duty requires that the whole subject should be\r\npresented, as it now is, for the action of Congress, whose exclusive\r\nright it is to decide on the further measures of redress to be employed.\r\nThe length of time since some of the injuries have been committed, the\r\nrepeated and unavailing applications for redress, the wanton character\r\nof some of the outrages upon the property and persons of our citizens,\r\nupon the officers and flag of the United States, independent of recent\r\ninsults to this Government and people by the late extraordinary Mexican\r\nminister, would justify in the eyes of all nations immediate war.\r\nThat remedy, however, should not be used by just and generous nations,\r\nconfiding in their strength for injuries committed, if it can be\r\nhonorably avoided; and it has occurred to me that, considering the\r\npresent embarrassed condition of that country, we should act with both\r\nwisdom and moderation by giving to Mexico one more opportunity to atone\r\nfor the past before we take redress into our own hands. To avoid all\r\nmisconception on the part of Mexico, as well as to protect our own\r\nnational character from reproach, this opportunity should be given with\r\nthe avowed design and full preparation to take immediate satisfaction if\r\nit should not be obtained on a repetition of the demand for it. To this\r\nend I recommend that an act be passed authorizing reprisals, and the use\r\nof the naval force of the United States by the Executive against Mexico\r\nto enforce them, in the event of a refusal by the Mexican Government to\r\ncome to an amicable adjustment of the matters in controversy between us\r\nupon another demand thereof made from on board one of our vessels of\r\nwar on the coast of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe documents herewith transmitted, with those accompanying my message\r\nin answer to a call of the House of Representatives of the 17th ultimo,\r\nwill enable Congress to judge of the propriety of the course heretofore\r\npursued and to decide upon the necessity of that now recommended.\r\n\r\nIf these views should fail to meet the concurrence of Congress, and that\r\nbody be able to find in the condition of the affairs between the two\r\ncountries, as disclosed by the accompanying documents, with those\r\nreferred to, any well-grounded reasons to hope that an adjustment of\r\nthe controversy between them can be effected without a resort to the\r\nmeasures I have felt it my duty to recommend, they may be assured of\r\nmy cooperation in any other course that shall be deemed honorable\r\nand proper.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 7, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit communications from the War Department relating to the treaty\r\nwith the Sacs and Foxes recently submitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 7, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the constitutional action of the Senate, a\r\nreport from the War Department, accompanied by a treaty with the Saganaw\r\ntribe of Chippewa Indians.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for your consideration and action, a treaty with certain\r\nPotawatamie Indians, accompanied by a report from the War Department.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 9, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress printed copies of the treaty of peace and\r\ncommerce between the United States and the Empire of Morocco, concluded\r\nat Meccanez on the 16th day of September last, and duly ratified by the\r\nrespective Governments.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 11, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives a letter addressed\r\nto me on the 30th ultimo by the governor of the State of New Hampshire,\r\ncommunicating several resolutions of the legislature of that\r\nCommonwealth and claiming the reimbursement of certain expenses incurred\r\nby that State in maintaining jurisdiction over that portion of its\r\nterritory north of the forty-fifth degree of north latitude, known\r\nby the name of Indian Stream, under circumstances explained in his\r\nexcellency's letter.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 13, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the Senate a report[27] from the Secretary of\r\nState, with accompanying papers, embracing a copy of the correspondence\r\nrequested by the resolution of the 7th instant, and such additional\r\ndocuments as were deemed necessary to a correct understanding of the\r\nwhole subject.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Relating to the seizure of slaves on board the brigs\r\n_Encomium_ and _Enterprise_ by the authorities of Bermuda and New\r\nProvidence.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _February 14, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a copy of the instructions, prepared under my\r\ndirection by the War Department, for the commissioners appointed by me,\r\nin pursuance of the request contained in the resolution adopted by the\r\nHouse of Representatives on the 1st of July last, to investigate the\r\ncauses of the hostilities then existing with the Creek Indians, and also\r\ncopies of the reports on that subject received from the commissioners.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 15, 1837.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the Senate a report of the Postmaster-General,\r\non the subject of the claims of Messrs.

This expectation I have reason to believe will be fulfilled,\r\nbut as it is necessary in the present state of the public service that\r\nthe vacancy should actually occur, and as it is doubtful whether Mr.\r\nButler can act under his present appointment after the expiration of\r\nthe present session of the Senate, I hereby nominate the said Benjamin\r\nF. Butler to be Secretary of War of the United States, to hold the said\r\noffice during the pleasure of the President until a successor duly\r\nappointed shall accept such office and enter on the duties thereof.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 3, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn my message to Congress of the 21st of December last I laid before\r\nthat body, without reserve, my views concerning the recognition of the\r\nindependence of Texas, with a report of the agent employed by the\r\nExecutive to obtain information in respect to the condition of that\r\ncountry. Since that time the subject has been repeatedly discussed in\r\nboth branches of the Legislature. These discussions have resulted in the\r\ninsertion of a clause in the general appropriation law passed by both\r\nHouses providing for the outfit and salary of a diplomatic agent to be\r\nsent to the Republic of Texas whenever the President of the United\r\nStates may receive satisfactory evidence that Texas is an independent\r\npower and shall deem it expedient to appoint such minister, and in the\r\nadoption of a resolution by the Senate, the constitutional advisers of\r\nthe Executive on the diplomatic intercourse of the United States with\r\nforeign powers, expressing the opinion that \"the State of Texas having\r\nestablished and maintained an independent government capable of\r\nperforming those duties, foreign and domestic, which appertain to\r\nindependent governments, and it appearing that there is no longer any\r\nreasonable prospect of the successful prosecution of the war by Mexico\r\nagainst said State, it is expedient and proper and in conformity with\r\nthe laws of nations and the practice of this Government in like cases\r\nthat the independent political existence of said State be acknowledged\r\nby the Government of the United States.\" Regarding these proceedings\r\nas a virtual decision of the question submitted by me to Congress,\r\nI think it my duty to acquiesce therein, and therefore I nominate Alcee\r\nLa Branche, of Louisiana, to be chargé d'affaires to the Republic\r\nof Texas.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGE.[29]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Pocket veto. This message was never sent to Congress, but\r\nwas deposited in the Department of State.]\r\n\r\nMARCH 3, 1837--11.45 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe bill from the Senate entitled \"An act designating and limiting the\r\nfunds receivable for the revenues of the United States\" came to my hands\r\nyesterday at 2 o'clock p. m. On perusing it I found its provisions so\r\ncomplex and uncertain that I deemed it necessary to obtain the opinion\r\nof the Attorney-General of the United States on several important\r\nquestions touching its construction and effect before I could decide\r\non the disposition to be made of it. The Attorney-General took up the\r\nsubject immediately, and his reply was reported to me this day at 5\r\no'clock p. m., and is hereunto annexed. As this officer, after a careful\r\nand laborious examination of the bill and a distinct expression of his\r\nopinion on the points proposed to him still came to the conclusion\r\nthat the construction of the bill, should it become a law, would yet\r\nbe a subject of much perplexity and doubt (a view of the bill entirely\r\ncoincident with my own), and as I can not think it proper, in a matter\r\nof such vital interest and of such constant application, to approve a\r\nbill so liable to diversity of interpretations, and more especially as\r\nI have not had time, amid the duties constantly pressing on me, to give\r\nthe subject that deliberate consideration which its importance demands,\r\nI am constrained to retain the bill, without acting definitively\r\nthereon; and to the end that my reasons for this step may be fully\r\nunderstood I shall cause this paper, with the opinion of the\r\nAttorney-General and the bill in question, to be deposited in the\r\nDepartment of State.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_March 3, 1837_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have had the honor to receive the several questions proposed to\r\nme by you on the bill which has just passed the two Houses of Congress,\r\nentitled \"An act designating and limiting the funds receivable for\r\nthe revenues of the United States,\" and which is now before you for\r\nconsideration. These questions may be arranged under three general\r\nheads, and in that order I shall proceed to reply to them.\r\n\r\nI. Will the proposed bill, if approved, repeal or alter the laws now in\r\nforce designating the currency required to be received in payment of the\r\npublic dues, for lands or otherwise?\r\n\r\nWill it compel the Treasury officers to receive the notes of\r\nspecie-paying banks having the characteristics described in its first\r\nand second sections?\r\n\r\nIn what respect does it differ from and how far will it change the joint\r\nresolution of April 30, 1816?\r\n\r\n_Answer_. In order to a correct reply to this question, and indeed to\r\nany other question arising on this obscurely penned bill, we must first\r\nobtain a general view of all its provisions.\r\n\r\nThe first section requires the Secretary of the Treasury to take\r\nmeasures for collecting the public revenue, first, in the legal currency\r\nof the United States (i.e., gold and silver), or, second, in the notes\r\nof such specie-paying banks as shall from time to time conform to\r\ncertain conditions in regard to small bills, described in the section.\r\nThis section does not expressly give the Secretary power to direct that\r\nany particular notes _shall_ be received for lands or for duties, but it\r\n_forbids_ the receipt of any paper currency other than such bank notes\r\nas are described in the section; and it requires the Secretary to adopt\r\nmeasures, in his discretion, to effectuate that prohibition.\r\n\r\nThe second section extends the prohibition still further, by forbidding\r\nthe receipt of any notes which the banks in which they are to be\r\ndeposited shall not, under the supervision and control of the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, agree to pass to the credit of the United States as\r\n_cash_; to which is added a proviso authorizing the Secretary to\r\nwithdraw the public deposits from any bank which shall refuse to receive\r\nas cash from the United States any notes receivable under the law which\r\nsuch bank receives in the ordinary course of business on general\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\nThe third and last section allows the receipt, as heretofore, of land\r\nscrip and Treasury certificates for public lands, and forbids the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury to make any discrimination in the funds\r\nreceivable (other than such as results from the receipt of land scrip\r\nor Treasury certificates) between the different branches of the public\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\nFrom this analysis of the bill it appears that, so far as regards bank\r\nnotes, the bill designates and limits then: receivableness for the\r\nrevenues of the United States, first, by forbidding the receipts of any\r\nexcept such as have all the characteristics described in the first and\r\nsecond sections of the bill, and, secondly, by restraining the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury from making any discrimination in this respect between\r\nthe different branches of the public revenue. In this way the bill\r\nperforms, to a certain extent, the office of \"designating and limiting\r\nthe funds receivable for the revenues of the United States,\" as\r\nmentioned in its title; but it would seem from what has been stated\r\nthat it is only in this way that any such office is performed. This\r\nimpression will be fully confirmed as we proceed.\r\n\r\nThe bill, should it be approved, will be supplementary to the laws now\r\nin force relating to the same subject, but as it contains no repealing\r\nclause no provision of those former laws, except such as may be plainly\r\nrepugnant to the present bill, will be repealed by it.\r\n\r\nThe existing laws embraced in the above question, and applicable to the\r\nsubject, are:\r\n\r\n_First. As to duties on goods imported_.--The seventy-fourth section\r\nof the collection law of the 2d of March, 1799, the first of which,\r\nreenacting in this respect the act of the 31st of July, 1789, provides\r\n\"that all duties and fees to be collected shall be _payable in money of\r\nthe United States or in foreign gold and silver coins_ at the following\r\nrates,\" etc. The residue of the section, as to rates, has been altered\r\nby subsequent laws, and the clause quoted was varied during the\r\nexistence of the Bank of the United States, the notes of which were\r\nexpressly made receivable in all payments to the United States, and\r\nduring the existence of the act making Treasury notes receivable by\r\nsuch act; but in no other respects has it ever been repealed.\r\n\r\n_Second. As to public lands.--_The general land law of the 10th of May,\r\n1800, section 5, provided that no lands should be sold, \"at either\r\npublic or private sale, for less than $2 per acre, and payment may be\r\nmade for the same by all purchasers _either in specie or in evidences of\r\nthe public debt of the United States,_ at the rates prescribed\" by a\r\nprior law. This provision was varied by the acts relative to Treasury\r\nnotes and the Bank of the United States in like manner as above\r\nmentioned. The second section of the general land law of the 24th of\r\nApril, 1820, abrogated the allowance of credits on the sale of public\r\nlands after the its day of July then next; required every purchaser at\r\npublic sale to make complete payment on the day of purchase, and the\r\npurchaser at private sale to produce to the register a receipt from the\r\nTreasurer of the United States or from the receiver of the district for\r\nthe amount of the purchase money. The proviso to the fourth section of\r\nthe same law enacted, in respect to reverted lands and lands remaining\r\nunsold, that they should not be sold for less price than $1.25 per acre,\r\n\"nor on any other terms than that of _cash_ payment.\" This latter act\r\nhas been further modified by the allowing Virginia land scrip to be\r\nreceived in payment for public lands.\r\n\r\n_Third. As to both duties and lands_.--The joint resolution of the 30th\r\nof April, 1816, provides that the Secretary of the Treasury \"be required\r\nand directed to adopt such measures as he may deem necessary to cause,\r\nas soon as may be, all duties, taxes, debts, or sums of money accruing\r\nor becoming payable to the United States to be collected and paid in the\r\nlegal currency of the United States, or Treasury notes, or notes of the\r\nBank of the United States, _as by law provided and declared_, or in\r\nnotes of banks which are payable and paid on demand in the said legal\r\ncurrency of the United States, and that from and after the 20th day of\r\nFebruary next no such duties, taxes, debts, or sums of money accruing or\r\nbecoming payable to the United States as aforesaid ought to be collected\r\nor received otherwise than in the legal currency of the United States,\r\nor Treasury notes, or notes of the Bank of the United States, or in\r\nnotes of banks which are payable and paid on demand in the legal\r\ncurrency of the United States.\" According to the opinion given by me as\r\na member of your Cabinet in the month of July last, and to which I still\r\nadhere, this resolution was mandatory only as it respected the legal\r\ncurrency of the United States, Treasury notes, and notes of the Bank\r\nof the United States, and in respect to the notes of the State banks,\r\nthough payable and paid in specie, was permissive merely in the\r\ndiscretion of the Secretary; and in accordance with this opinion has\r\nbeen the practical construction given to the resolution by the Treasury\r\nDepartment. It is known to you, however, that distinguished names have\r\nbeen vouched for the opinion that the resolution was mandatory as to the\r\nnotes of all specie-paying banks; that the debtor had the right, at his\r\noption, to make payment in such notes, and that if tendered by him the\r\nTreasury officers had no discretion to refuse them.\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that the laws now in force, so far as they _positively\r\nenjoin_ the receipt of any particular currency in payment of public\r\ndues, are confined to gold and silver, except that in certain cases\r\nVirginia land scrip and Treasury certificates are directed to be\r\nreceived on the sale of public lands. In my opinion, there is nothing in\r\nthe bill before me repugnant to those laws. The bill does not _expressly\r\n_ declare and enact that any particular species of currency _shall be\r\nreceivable _in payment of the public revenue. On the contrary, as the\r\nprovisions of the first and second sections are chiefly of a _negative_\r\ncharacter, I think they do not take away the power of the Secretary,\r\npreviously possessed under the acts of Congress, and as the agent of\r\nthe President, to _forbid_ the receipt of any bank notes which are not\r\nby some act of Congress expressly made absolutely receivable in payment\r\nof the public dues.\r\n\r\nThe above view will, I think, be confirmed by a closer examination\r\nof the bill. It sets out with the assumption that there is a currency\r\nestablished by law (i. e., gold and silver); and it further assumes that\r\nthe public revenue of all descriptions ought to be collected exclusively\r\nin such legal currency, or in bank notes of a certain character; and\r\ntherefore it provides that the Secretary of the Treasury _shall_ take\r\nmeasures to effect a collection of the revenue \"in the legal currency\r\nof the United States, _or_ in notes of banks which are payable and paid\r\non demand in the said legal currency,\" under certain restrictions,\r\nafterwards mentioned in the act.\r\n\r\nThe question then arises: Are bank notes having the requisite\r\ncharacteristics placed by the clause just quoted on the same footing\r\nwith the legal currency, so as to make it the duty of the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury to allow the receipt of them when tendered by the debtor?\r\nIn my judgment, such is not the effect of the provision.\r\n\r\nIf Congress had intended to make so important an alteration of the\r\nexisting law as to compel the receiving officers to take payment in the\r\nbank notes described in the bill, the natural phraseology would have\r\nbeen, \"in the legal currency of the United States _and_ in notes of\r\nbanks which are payable and paid in the legal currency,\" etc. And it is\r\nreasonable to presume that Congress would have used such, phraseology,\r\nor would have gone on to make a distinct provision expressly declaring\r\nthat such bank notes _should be receivable, _as was done in the bank\r\ncharters of 1790 and 1816, and as was also done by the acts relative to\r\nevidences of debt, Treasury notes, and Virginia land scrip. The form of\r\none of these provisions (the fourteenth section of the act incorporating\r\nthe late Bank of the United States) will illustrate the idea I desire\r\nto present:\r\n\r\n\"SEC. 14. _And be it further enacted, _That the bills or notes of the\r\nsaid corporation, originally made payable, or which shall have become\r\npayable, on demand, _shall be receivable _in all payments to the United\r\nStates, unless otherwise directed by act of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThe difference between the language there used and that employed in the\r\npresent bill is too obvious to require comment. It is true that the word\r\n\"or,\" when it occurs in wills and agreements, is sometimes construed to\r\nmean \"and,\" in order to give effect to the plain intent of the parties;\r\nand such a construction of the word may sometimes be given when it\r\noccurs in statutes, where the general intent of the lawmakers evidently\r\nrequires it. But this construction of the word in the present case is\r\nnot only unnecessary, but, in my opinion, repugnant to the whole scope\r\nof the bill, which, so far from commanding the public officers to\r\nreceive bank notes in cases not required by the existing laws,\r\nintroduces several new prohibitions on the receipt of such notes.\r\n\r\nNor do I think this one of those cases in which a choice is given to the\r\ndebtor to pay in one or other of two descriptions of currency, both of\r\nwhich are receivable by law. Such a choice was given by the land law of\r\nthe 10th of May, 1800, section 5, between specie and the evidences of\r\nthe public debt of the United States then receivable by law, and also\r\nby the joint resolution of the 30th of April, 1816, between \"the legal\r\ncurrency of the United States, or Treasury notes, or notes of the Bank\r\nof the United States, as by law provided and declared.\" The option given\r\nby that resolution continued in force so long as the laws providing and\r\ndeclaring that Treasury notes and notes of the Bank of the United States\r\nshould be receivable in payments to the United States, and ceased when\r\nthose laws expired. The distinction between that description of paper\r\ncurrency which is by law expressly made receivable in payment of public\r\ndues, and the notes of the State banks, which were only _permitted_ to\r\nbe received, is plainly marked in the resolution of 1816. While the\r\nformer are placed on the same footing with the legal currency, because\r\nby previous laws it had been so \"_provided and declared_\" the latter\r\nwere left to be received or not received, at the discretion of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, except that he was restricted from allowing\r\nany to be received which were not payable and paid on demand in the\r\nlegal currency. The bank notes spoken of in the bill before me, having\r\nnever been made receivable by law, must be regarded as belonging to the\r\nlatter class, and not to the former; and there can therefore be no\r\ngreater obligation under the present bill, should it become a law, to\r\nreceive them in payment than there was to receive the paper of the\r\nState banks under the resolution of 1816.\r\n\r\nAs to the difference between this bill and the joint resolution of 1816,\r\nthe bill differs from that resolution in the following particulars:\r\n\r\nFirst. It says nothing of Treasury notes and the notes of the Bank of\r\nthe United States, which by the resolution of 1816 are recognized as\r\nhaving been made receivable by laws then in force in payment of public\r\ndues of all descriptions.\r\n\r\nSecond. It abridges the discretion left with the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury by that resolution, by positively forbidding the receipt of\r\nbank notes not having the characteristics described in the first and\r\nsecond sections of the bill; whereas the receipt of some of the notes so\r\nforbidden might, under the resolution of 1816, have been allowed by the\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nThird. It forbids the making of any discrimination in respect to the\r\nreceipt of bank notes between the different branches of the public\r\nrevenue; whereas the Secretary of the Treasury, under the resolution of\r\n1816, was subject to no such restraint, and had the power to make the\r\ndiscrimination forbidden by the bill, except as to the notes of the Bank\r\nof the United States and Treasury notes.\r\n\r\nThis bill, if approved, will change the resolution of 1816, so far\r\nas it now remains in force, in the second and third particulars just\r\nmentioned, but in my opinion, as already suggested, will change it in\r\nno other respect.\r\n\r\nII. What is the extent of the supervision and control allowed by this\r\nbill to the Secretary of the Treasury over the notes to be received by\r\nthe deposit banks?\r\n\r\nAnd does it allow him to direct what particular notes shall or shall not\r\nbe received for lands or for duties?\r\n\r\n_Answer_. After maturely considering, so far as time has been\r\nallowed me, the several provisions of the bill, I think the following\r\nconclusions may fairly be drawn from them when taken in connection with\r\nthe laws now in force, and above referred to, and that should it become\r\na law they will probably express its legal effect.\r\n\r\nFirst. That the Secretary of the Treasury _can not direct _the receipt\r\nof any notes except such as are issued by banks which conform to the\r\nfirst section of the law and such as will be passed by the proper\r\ndeposit bank to the credit of the United States as _cash_.\r\n\r\nSecond. That he _may direct_ the receipt of notes issued by banks which\r\nconform to the first section, provided the deposit bank in which the\r\nnotes are to be deposited shall agree to credit them as cash.\r\n\r\nThird. That if the deposit bank in which the money is to be deposited\r\nshall refuse to receive as cash the notes designated by the Secretary,\r\nand which such bank receives in the ordinary course of business on\r\ngeneral deposit, he may withdraw the public deposits and select another\r\ndepository which will agree to receive them.\r\n\r\nFourth. That if he can not find a depository which will so agree, then\r\nthat the Secretary can not direct or authorize the receipt of any notes\r\nexcept such as the deposit bank primarily entitled to the deposits will\r\nagree to receive and deposit as cash.\r\n\r\nFifth. That although a deposit bank might be willing to receive from\r\nthe collectors and receivers, and to credit as _cash_, notes of certain\r\nbanks which conform to the first section, yet, for the reasons before\r\nstated, I am of opinion that the Secretary is not _obliged_ to allow the\r\nreceipt of such notes.\r\n\r\nSixth. The Secretary is forbidden to make any discrimination in\r\n_the funds receivable _\"between the different branches of the public\r\nrevenue,\" and therefore, though he may forbid the receipt of the notes\r\nof any particular bank or class of banks not excluded by the bill, and\r\nmay forbid the receipt of notes of denominations larger than those named\r\nin the bill, yet when he issues any such prohibition it must apply to\r\n_all_ the branches of the public revenue.\r\n\r\nSeventh. If I am right in the foregoing propositions, the result will be\r\nthat the proposed law will leave in the Secretary of the Treasury power\r\nto _prohibit_ the receipt of particular _notes provided his prohibition\r\napply to both lands and duties, _and power to _direct_ what particular\r\nnotes allowed by the law shall be received _provided he can find a\r\ndeposit bank which will agree to receive and [credit] them as cash_.\r\n\r\nIII. Are the deposit banks the sole judges under this bill of what\r\nnotes they will receive, or are they bound to receive the notes of every\r\nspecie-paying bank, chartered or unchartered, wherever situated, in any\r\npart of the United States?\r\n\r\n_Answer_. In my opinion the deposit banks, under the bill in question,\r\nwill be the sole judges of the notes to be received by them from any\r\ncollector or receiver of public money, and they will not be bound to\r\nreceive the notes of any other bank whose notes they may choose to\r\nreject, provided they apply the same rule to the United States which\r\nthey apply to their own depositors. In other words, the general rule as\r\nto what notes are to be received as cash, prescribed by each deposit\r\nbank for the regulation of its ordinary business, must be complied with\r\nby the collectors and receivers whose moneys are to be deposited with\r\nthat bank. But it will not therefore follow that those officers will be\r\nbound to receive what the bank generally receives, because, as already\r\nstated, they may refuse of their own accord, or under the direction of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, any bank notes not expressly directed by\r\nact of Congress to be received in payment of the public dues.\r\n\r\nI have thus answered the several questions proposed on the bill before\r\nme; and though I have been necessarily obliged to examine the subject\r\nwith much haste, I have no other doubts as to the soundness of the\r\nconstruction above given than such as belong to discussions of this\r\nnature and to a proper sense of the fallibility of human judgment. It\r\nis, however, my duty to remind you that very different opinions were\r\nexpressed in the course of the debates on the proposed law by some of\r\nthe members who took part therein. It would seem from these debates that\r\nthe bill, in some instances at least, was supported under the impression\r\nthat it would compel the Treasury officers to receive all bank notes\r\npossessing all the characteristics described in the first and second\r\nsections, and that the Secretary of the Treasury would have no power\r\nto forbid their receipt. It must be confessed that the language is\r\nsufficiently ambiguous to give some plausibility to such a construction,\r\nand that it seems to derive some support from the refusal of the House\r\nof Representatives to consider an amendment reported by the Committee of\r\nWays and Means of that House, which would substantially have given the\r\nbill, in explicit terms, the interpretation I have put on it, and have\r\nremoved the uncertainty which now pervades it. Under these circumstances\r\nit may reasonably be expected that the true meaning of the bill, should\r\nit be passed into a law, will become a subject of discussion and\r\ncontroversy, and probably remain involved in much perplexity and doubt\r\nuntil it shall have been settled by a judicial decision. How far these\r\nlatter considerations are to be regarded by you in your decision on the\r\nbill is a question which belongs to another place, and on which,\r\ntherefore, I forbear to enlarge in this communication. I have the honor\r\nto be, sir, with high respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nB.F.

BUTLER,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War ad interim_.\r\n\r\nP.S.--The proceedings and a portion of the documents accompany this.\r\nThe balance of the documents (except Nos. 204 and 209, which will be\r\nsent to-morrow) are in a separate package, and sent by the same mail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 14, 1837_.\r\n\r\nThe President has carefully examined the proceedings of the court of\r\ninquiry recently held at the city of Frederick, by virtue of Orders\r\nNos. 65 and 68, so far as the same relate to the causes of the delay in\r\nopening and prosecuting the campaign in Georgia and Alabama against the\r\nhostile Creek Indians in the year 1836, and has maturely considered the\r\nopinion of the court on this part of the subject referred to it.\r\n\r\nThe order constituting the court directs it, among other things--\r\n\r\n\r\n  To inquire and examine into the causes of the delay in opening and\r\n  prosecuting the campaign in Georgia and Alabama against the hostile\r\n  Creek Indians in the year 1836, and into every subject connected with\r\n  the military operations in the campaign aforesaid, and, after fully\r\n  investigating the same, to report the facts, together with its opinion\r\n  on the whole subject, for the information of the President.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears from the proceedings that after the testimony of nine\r\nwitnesses had been received by the court, and after more than one\r\nhundred documents bearing on the subject had also been produced in\r\nevidence, and after Major-General Scott had addressed the court on the\r\nsubject, the court proceeded to pronounce its opinion, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Upon a careful examination of the abundant testimony taken in the\r\n  foregoing case the court is of opinion that no delay which it was\r\n  practicable to have avoided was made by Major-General Scott in opening\r\n  the campaign against the Creek Indians. On the contrary, it appears\r\n  that he took the earliest measures to provide arms, munitions, and\r\n  provisions for his forces, who were found almost wholly destitute; and\r\n  as soon as arms could be put into the hands of the volunteers they\r\n  were, in succession, detached and placed in position to prevent the\r\n  enemy from retiring upon Florida, and whence they could move against\r\n  the main body of the enemy as soon as equipped for offensive\r\n  operations.\r\n\r\n  From the testimony of the governor of Georgia, of Major-General\r\n  Sanford, commander of the Georgia volunteers, and many other witnesses\r\n  of high rank and standing who were acquainted with the topography of\r\n  the country and the position and strength of the enemy, the court is\r\n  of opinion that the plan of campaign adopted by Major-General Scott\r\n  was well calculated to lead to successful results, and that it was\r\n  prosecuted by him, as far as practicable, with zeal and ability, until\r\n  recalled from the command upon representations made by Major-General\r\n  Jesup, his second in command, from Fort Mitchell, in a letter bearing\r\n  date the 20th of June, 1836, addressed to F.P. Blair, esq., at\r\n  Washington, marked \"private,\" containing a request that it be shown to\r\n  the President; which letter was exposed and brought to light by the\r\n  dignified and magnanimous act of the President in causing it to be\r\n  placed on file in the Department of War as an official document, and\r\n  which forms part of the proceedings. (See Document No. 214.) Conduct\r\n  so extraordinary and inexplicable on the part of Major-General Jesup,\r\n  in reference to the character of said letter, should, in the opinion\r\n  of the court, be investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing opinion is not accompanied by any report of the _facts_\r\nin the case, as required by the order constituting the court; on the\r\ncontrary, the facts are left to be gathered from the mass of oral and\r\ndocumentary evidence contained in the proceedings, and thus a most\r\nimportant part of the duty assigned to the court remains unexecuted.\r\nHad the court stated the facts of the case as established to its\r\nsatisfaction by the evidence before it, the President, on comparing\r\nsuch state of facts found by the court with its opinion, would have\r\ndistinctly understood the views entertained by the court in respect to\r\nthe degree of promptitude and energy which ought to be displayed in a\r\ncampaign against Indians--and one which the President's examination of\r\nthe evidence has not supplied, inasmuch as he has no means of knowing\r\nwhether the conclusions drawn by him from the evidence agree with those\r\nof the court.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the court is also argumentative, and wanting in\r\nrequisite precision, inasmuch as it states that \"no delay _which it\r\nwas practicable to have avoided was made by Major-General Scott_ in\r\nopening the campaign against the Creek Indians,\" etc.; thus leaving it\r\nto be inferred, but not distinctly finding, that there was some delay,\r\nand that it was made by some person other than Major-General Scott,\r\nwithout specifying in what such delay consisted, when it occurred, how\r\nlong it continued, nor by whom it was occasioned. Had the court found\r\na state of facts, as required by the order constituting it, the\r\nuncertainty now existing in this part of the opinion would have been\r\nobviated and the justice of the opinion itself readily determined.\r\n\r\nThat part of the opinion of the court which animadverts on the letter\r\naddressed by Major-General Jesup to F.P. Blair, esq., bearing date the\r\n20th of June, 1836, and which presents the same as a subject demanding\r\ninvestigation, appears to the President to be wholly unauthorized by the\r\norder constituting the court, and by which its jurisdiction was confined\r\nto an inquiry into the causes of the delay in opening and prosecuting\r\nthe campaign against the hostile Creeks and into such subjects as were\r\nconnected with the military operations in that campaign. The causes of\r\nthe recall of Major-General Scott from the command and the propriety\r\nor impropriety of the conduct of General Jesup in writing the letter\r\nreferred to were not submitted to the court as subjects of inquiry. The\r\ncourt itself appears to have been of this opinion, inasmuch as no notice\r\nwas given to General Jesup of the pendency of the proceedings, nor had\r\nhe any opportunity to cross-examine and interrogate the witnesses, nor\r\nto be heard in respect to his conduct in the matter remarked on by the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nFor the several reasons above assigned, the President disapproves the\r\nopinion of the court, and remits to it the proceedings in question, to\r\nthe end that the court may resume the consideration of the evidence and\r\nfrom the same, and from such further evidence as shall be taken (in\r\ncase the court shall deem it necessary to take further evidence), may\r\nascertain and report with distinctness and precision, especially as to\r\ntime, place, distances, and other circumstances, all the facts touching\r\nthe opening and prosecuting of the campaign in Georgia and Alabama\r\nagainst the hostile Creek Indians in the year 1836, and the military\r\noperations in the said campaign, and touching the delay, if any there\r\nwas, in the opening or prosecuting of said campaign, and the causes of\r\nsuch delay; and to the end, also, that the court, whilst confining its\r\nopinion to the subject-matters submitted to it, may fully and distinctly\r\nexpress its opinion on those matters for the information of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War _ad interim _will cause the proceedings of the\r\ncourt on the subject of the campaign against the Creek Indians, with the\r\ndocumentary evidence referred to therein and a copy of the foregoing\r\nopinion, to be transmitted to Major-General Alexander Macomb, president\r\nof the court, for the proper action thereon.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 18, 1837_.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the court of inquiry recently assembled and\r\nstill sitting at Frederick by virtue of Orders Nos. 65 and 68, so\r\nfar as the same relate to the causes of the failure of the campaign\r\nof Major-General Scott against the Seminole Indians in 1836, were\r\nheretofore submitted to the President, and the examination thereof\r\nsuspended in consequence of the necessary connection between the case\r\nof Major-General Scott and that of Major-General Gaines, also referred\r\nto the same court, and not yet reported on. Certain other proceedings\r\nof the same court having been since examined by the President, and\r\nhaving been found defective, and therefore remitted to the court for\r\nreconsideration, the President has deemed it proper, in order to\r\nexpedite the matter, to look into the first-mentioned proceedings for\r\nthe purpose of ascertaining whether or not the like defects existed\r\ntherein. On this inspection of the record he perceives that the court\r\nhas not reported, except in a few instances, the facts of the case, as\r\nrequired by the order constituting the court, and in those instances the\r\nfacts found by the court are stated in a very general form and without\r\nsufficient minuteness and precision; and he therefore remits the said\r\nproceedings to the court, to the end that the court may resume the\r\nconsideration of the evidence, and from the same, and from such further\r\nevidence as may be taken (in case the court shall deem it necessary to\r\ntake further evidence), may ascertain and report with distinctness\r\nand precision all the facts touching the subject to be inquired of,\r\nestablished to the satisfaction of the court by the evidence before it,\r\nand especially the times when and places where the several occurrences\r\nwhich are deemed material by the court in the formation of its opinion\r\nactually took place, with the amount of force on both sides at the\r\ndifferent periods of time embraced in the transactions, and the\r\npositions thereof, and such other circumstances as are deemed material\r\nby the court; together with its opinion on the whole subject, for the\r\ninformation of the President.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War _ad interim_ will cause the proceedings of the\r\ncourt in the case of Major-General Scott, first above mentioned, with\r\nthe documentary evidence referred to therein and a copy hereof, to be\r\ntransmitted to Major-General Alexander Macomb, president of the court,\r\nfor the proper action thereon.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAREWELL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1837.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: Being about to retire finally from public life, I beg\r\nleave to offer you my grateful thanks for the many proofs of kindness\r\nand confidence which I have received at your hands. It has been\r\nmy fortune in the discharge of public duties, civil and military,\r\nfrequently to have found myself in difficult and trying situations,\r\nwhere prompt decision and energetic action were necessary, and where the\r\ninterest of the country required that high responsibilities should be\r\nfearlessly encountered; and it is with the deepest emotions of gratitude\r\nthat I acknowledge the continued and unbroken confidence with which you\r\nhave sustained me in every trial. My public life has been a long one,\r\nand I can not hope that it has at all times been free from errors; but\r\nI have the consolation of knowing that if mistakes have been committed\r\nthey have not seriously injured the country I so anxiously endeavored to\r\nserve, and at the moment when I surrender my last public trust I leave\r\nthis great people prosperous and happy, in the full enjoyment of liberty\r\nand peace, and honored and respected by every nation of the world.\r\n\r\nIf my humble efforts have in any degree contributed to preserve to you\r\nthese blessings, I have been more than rewarded by the honors you have\r\nheaped upon me, and, above all, by the generous confidence with which\r\nyou have supported me in every peril, and with which you have continued\r\nto animate and cheer my path to the closing hour of my political life.\r\nThe time has now come when advanced age and a broken frame warn me to\r\nretire from public concerns, but the recollection of the many favors\r\nyou have bestowed upon me is engraven upon my heart, and I have felt\r\nthat I could not part from your service without making this public\r\nacknowledgment of the gratitude I owe you. And if I use the occasion\r\nto offer to you the counsels of age and experience, you will, I trust,\r\nreceive them with the same indulgent kindness which you have so often\r\nextended to me, and will at least see in them an earnest desire to\r\nperpetuate in this favored land the blessings of liberty and equal law.\r\n\r\nWe have now lived almost fifty years under the Constitution framed by\r\nthe sages and patriots of the Revolution. The conflicts in which the\r\nnations of Europe were engaged during a great part of this period, the\r\nspirit in which they waged war against each other, and our intimate\r\ncommercial connections with every part of the civilized world rendered\r\nit a time of much difficulty for the Government of the United States.\r\nWe have had our seasons of peace and of war, with all the evils which\r\nprecede or follow a state of hostility with powerful nations. We\r\nencountered these trials with our Constitution yet in its infancy, and\r\nunder the disadvantages which a new and untried government must always\r\nfeel when it is called upon to put forth its whole strength without the\r\nlights of experience to guide it or the weight of precedents to justify\r\nits measures. But we have passed triumphantly through all these\r\ndifficulties. Our Constitution is no longer a doubtful experiment,\r\nand at the end of nearly half a century we find that it has preserved\r\nunimpaired the liberties of the people, secured the rights of property,\r\nand that our country has improved and is flourishing beyond any former\r\nexample in the history of nations.\r\n\r\nIn our domestic concerns there is everything to encourage us, and if\r\nyou are true to yourselves nothing can impede your march to the highest\r\npoint of national prosperity. The States which had so long been retarded\r\nin their improvement by the Indian tribes residing in the midst of\r\nthem are at length relieved from the evil, and this unhappy race--the\r\noriginal dwellers in our land--are now placed in a situation where we\r\nmay well hope that they will share in the blessings of civilization\r\nand be saved from that degradation and destruction to which they were\r\nrapidly hastening while they remained in the States; and while the\r\nsafety and comfort of our own citizens have been greatly promoted by\r\ntheir removal, the philanthropist will rejoice that the remnant of that\r\nill-fated race has been at length placed beyond the reach of injury or\r\noppression, and that the paternal care of the General Government will\r\nhereafter watch over them and protect them.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to our relations with foreign powers, we find our condition\r\nequally gratifying. Actuated by the sincere desire to do justice to\r\nevery nation and to preserve the blessings of peace, our intercourse\r\nwith them has been conducted on the part of this Government in the\r\nspirit of frankness; and I take pleasure in saying that it has generally\r\nbeen met in a corresponding temper. Difficulties of old standing have\r\nbeen surmounted by friendly discussion and the mutual desire to be just,\r\nand the claims of our citizens, which had been long withheld, have at\r\nlength been acknowledged and adjusted and satisfactory arrangements made\r\nfor their final payment; and with a limited, and I trust a temporary,\r\nexception, our relations with every foreign power are now of the most\r\nfriendly character, our commerce continually expanding, and our flag\r\nrespected in every quarter of the world.\r\n\r\nThese cheering and grateful prospects and these multiplied favors we\r\nowe, under Providence, to the adoption of the Federal Constitution. It\r\nis no longer a question whether this great country can remain happily\r\nunited and flourish under our present form of government. Experience,\r\nthe unerring test of all human undertakings, has shown the wisdom and\r\nforesight of those who formed it, and has proved that in the union of\r\nthese States there is a sure foundation for the brightest hopes of\r\nfreedom and for the happiness of the people. At every hazard and by\r\nevery sacrifice this Union must be preserved.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of watching with jealous anxiety for the preservation of\r\nthe Union was earnestly pressed upon his fellow-citizens by the Father\r\nof his Country in his Farewell Address. He has there told us that \"while\r\nexperience shall not have demonstrated its impracticability, there will\r\nalways be reason to distrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter\r\nmay endeavor to weaken its bands;\" and he has cautioned us in the\r\nstrongest terms against the formation of parties on geographical\r\ndiscriminations, as one of the means which might disturb our Union\r\nand to which designing men would be likely to resort.\r\n\r\nThe lessons contained in this invaluable legacy of Washington to his\r\ncountrymen should be cherished in the heart of every citizen to the\r\nlatest generation; and perhaps at no period of time could they be more\r\nusefully remembered than at the present moment; for when we look upon\r\nthe scenes that are passing around us and dwell upon the pages of his\r\nparting address, his paternal counsels would seem to be not merely\r\nthe offspring of wisdom and foresight, but the voice of prophecy,\r\nforetelling events and warning us of the evil to come. Forty years have\r\npassed since this imperishable document was given to his countrymen. The\r\nFederal Constitution was then regarded by him as an experiment--and he\r\nso speaks of it in his Address--but an experiment upon the success of\r\nwhich the best hopes of his country depended; and we all know that he\r\nwas prepared to lay down his life, if necessary, to secure to it a full\r\nand a fair trial. The trial has been made. It has succeeded beyond the\r\nproudest hopes of those who framed it. Every quarter of this widely\r\nextended nation has felt its blessings and shared in the general\r\nprosperity produced by its adoption. But amid this general prosperity\r\nand splendid success the dangers of which he warned us are becoming\r\nevery day more evident, and the signs of evil are sufficiently apparent\r\nto awaken the deepest anxiety in the bosom of the patriot. We behold\r\nsystematic efforts publicly made to sow the seeds of discord between\r\ndifferent parts of the United States and to place party divisions\r\ndirectly upon geographical distinctions; to excite the _South_ against\r\nthe _North_ and the _North_ against the _South_, and to force into the\r\ncontroversy the most delicate and exciting topics--topics upon which it\r\nis impossible that a large portion of the Union can ever speak without\r\nstrong emotion. Appeals, too, are constantly made to sectional interests\r\nin order to influence the election of the Chief Magistrate, as if it\r\nwere desired that he should favor a particular quarter of the country\r\ninstead of fulfilling the duties of his station with impartial justice\r\nto all; and the possible dissolution of the Union has at length become\r\nan ordinary and familiar subject of discussion. Has the warning voice of\r\nWashington been forgotten, or have designs already been formed to sever\r\nthe Union? Let it not be supposed that I impute to all of those who have\r\ntaken an active part in these unwise and unprofitable discussions a want\r\nof patriotism or of public virtue. The honorable feeling of State\r\npride and local attachments finds a place in the bosoms of the most\r\nenlightened and pure. But while such men are conscious of their own\r\nintegrity and honesty of purpose, they ought never to forget that the\r\ncitizens of other States are their political brethren, and that however\r\nmistaken they may be in their views, the great body of them are equally\r\nhonest and upright with themselves. Mutual suspicions and reproaches may\r\nin time create mutual hostility, and artful and designing men will\r\nalways be found who are ready to foment these fatal divisions and to\r\ninflame the natural jealousies of different sections of the country.\r\nThe history of the world is full of such examples, and especially the\r\nhistory of republics.\r\n\r\nWhat have you to gain by division and dissension? Delude not yourselves\r\nwith the belief that a breach once made may be afterwards repaired.\r\nIf the Union is once severed, the line of separation will grow wider\r\nand wider, and the controversies which are now debated and settled\r\nin the halls of legislation will then be tried in fields of battle and\r\ndetermined by the sword. Neither should you deceive yourselves with\r\nthe hope that the first line of separation would be the permanent one,\r\nand that nothing but harmony and concord would be found in the new\r\nassociations formed upon the dissolution of this Union. Local interests\r\nwould still be found there, and unchastened ambition. And if the\r\nrecollection of common dangers, in which the people of these United\r\nStates stood side by side against the common foe, the memory of\r\nvictories won by their united valor, the prosperity and happiness they\r\nhave enjoyed under the present Constitution, the proud name they bear as\r\ncitizens of this great Republic--if all these recollections and proofs\r\nof common interest are not strong enough to bind us together as one\r\npeople, what tie will hold united the new divisions of empire when these\r\nbonds have been broken and this Union dissevered? The first line of\r\nseparation would not last for a single generation; new fragments would\r\nbe torn off, new leaders would spring up, and this great and glorious\r\nRepublic would soon be broken into a multitude of petty States, without\r\ncommerce, without credit, jealous of one another, armed for mutual\r\naggression, loaded with taxes to pay armies and leaders, seeking aid\r\nagainst each other from foreign powers, insulted and trampled upon by\r\nthe nations of Europe, until, harassed with conflicts and humbled and\r\ndebased in spirit, they would be ready to submit to the absolute\r\ndominion of any military adventurer and to surrender their liberty for\r\nthe sake of repose. It is impossible to look on the consequences that\r\nwould inevitably follow the destruction of this Government and not feel\r\nindignant when we hear cold calculations about the value of the Union\r\nand have so constantly before us a line of conduct so well calculated\r\nto weaken its ties.\r\n\r\nThere is too much at stake to allow pride or passion to influence your\r\ndecision. Never for a moment believe that the great body of the citizens\r\nof any State or States can deliberately intend to do wrong. They may,\r\nunder the influence of temporary excitement or misguided opinions,\r\ncommit mistakes; they may be misled for a time by the suggestions of\r\nself-interest; but in a community so enlightened and patriotic as the\r\npeople of the United States argument will soon make them sensible of\r\ntheir errors, and when convinced they will be ready to repair them. If\r\nthey have no higher or better motives to govern them, they will at least\r\nperceive that their own interest requires them to be just to others, as\r\nthey hope to receive justice at their hands.\r\n\r\nBut in order to maintain the Union unimpaired it is absolutely necessary\r\nthat the laws passed by the constituted authorities should be faithfully\r\nexecuted in every part of the country, and that every good citizen\r\nshould at all times stand ready to put down, with the combined force\r\nof the nation, every attempt at unlawful resistance, under whatever\r\npretext it may be made or whatever shape it may assume. Unconstitutional\r\nor oppressive laws may no doubt be passed by Congress, either from\r\nerroneous views or the want of due consideration; if they are within\r\nthe reach of judicial authority, the remedy is easy and peaceful; and\r\nif, from the character of the law, it is an abuse of power not within\r\nthe control of the judiciary, then free discussion and calm appeals to\r\nreason and to the justice of the people will not fail to redress the\r\nwrong. But until the law shall be declared void by the courts or\r\nrepealed by Congress no individual or combination of individuals can be\r\njustified in forcibly resisting its execution. It is impossible that any\r\ngovernment can continue to exist upon any other principles. It would\r\ncease to be a government and be unworthy of the name if it had not the\r\npower to enforce the execution of its own laws within its own sphere\r\nof action.\r\n\r\nIt is true that cases may be imagined disclosing such a settled purpose\r\nof usurpation and oppression on the part of the Government as would\r\njustify an appeal to arms. These, however, are extreme cases, which we\r\nhave no reason to apprehend in a government where the power is in the\r\nhands of a patriotic people. And no citizen who loves his country would\r\nin any case whatever resort to forcible resistance unless he clearly saw\r\nthat the time had come when a freeman should prefer death to submission;\r\nfor if such a struggle is once begun, and the citizens of one section\r\nof the country arrayed in arms against those of another in doubtful\r\nconflict, let the battle result as it may, there will be an end of the\r\nUnion and with it an end to the hopes of freedom. The victory of the\r\ninjured would not secure to them the blessings of liberty; it would\r\navenge their wrongs, but they would themselves share in the common ruin.\r\n\r\nBut the Constitution can not be maintained nor the Union preserved,\r\nin opposition to public feeling, by the mere exertion of the coercive\r\npowers confided to the General Government. The foundations must be\r\nlaid in the affections of the people, in the security it gives to life,\r\nliberty, character, and property in every quarter of the country, and in\r\nthe fraternal attachment which the citizens of the several States bear\r\nto one another as members of one political family, mutually contributing\r\nto promote the happiness of each other. Hence the citizens of every\r\nState should studiously avoid everything calculated to wound the\r\nsensibility or offend the just pride of the people of other States, and\r\nthey should frown upon any proceedings within their own borders likely\r\nto disturb the tranquillity of their political brethren in other\r\nportions of the Union. In a country so extensive as the United States,\r\nand with pursuits so varied, the internal regulations of the several\r\nStates must frequently differ from one another in important particulars,\r\nand this difference is unavoidably increased by the varying principles\r\nupon which the American colonies were originally planted--principles\r\nwhich had taken deep root in their social relations before the\r\nRevolution, and therefore of necessity influencing their policy\r\nsince they became free and independent States. But each State has the\r\nunquestionable right to regulate its own internal concerns according to\r\nits own pleasure, and while it does not interfere with the rights of\r\nthe people of other States or the rights of the Union, every State must\r\nbe the sole judge of the measures proper to secure the safety of its\r\ncitizens and promote their happiness; and all efforts on the part of\r\npeople of other States to cast odium upon their institutions, and all\r\nmeasures calculated to disturb their rights of property or to put in\r\njeopardy their peace and internal tranquillity, are in direct opposition\r\nto the spirit in which the Union was formed, and must endanger its\r\nsafety. Motives of philanthropy may be assigned for this unwarrantable\r\ninterference, and weak men may persuade themselves for a moment that\r\nthey are laboring in the cause of humanity and asserting the rights of\r\nthe human race; but everyone, upon sober reflection, will see that\r\nnothing but mischief can come from these improper assaults upon the\r\nfeelings and rights of others. Rest assured that the men found busy in\r\nthis work of discord are not worthy of your confidence, and deserve\r\nyour strongest reprobation.\r\n\r\nIn the legislation of Congress also, and in every measure of the General\r\nGovernment, justice to every portion of the United States should be\r\nfaithfully observed. No free government can stand without virtue in the\r\npeople and a lofty spirit of patriotism, and if the sordid feelings of\r\nmere selfishness shall usurp the place which ought to be filled by\r\npublic spirit, the legislation of Congress will soon be converted\r\ninto a scramble for personal and sectional advantages. Under our free\r\ninstitutions the citizens of every quarter of our country are capable of\r\nattaining a high degree of prosperity and happiness without seeking to\r\nprofit themselves at the expense of others; and every such attempt must\r\nin the end fail to succeed, for the people in every part of the United\r\nStates are too enlightened not to understand their own rights and\r\ninterests and to detect and defeat every effort to gain undue advantages\r\nover them; and when such designs are discovered it naturally provokes\r\nresentments which can not always be easily allayed. Justice--full and\r\nample justice--to every portion of the United States should be the\r\nruling principle of every freeman, and should guide the deliberations\r\nof every public body, whether it be State or national.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that there have always been those amongst us who wish\r\nto enlarge the powers of the General Government, and experience would\r\nseem to indicate that there is a tendency on the part of this Government\r\nto overstep the boundaries marked out for it by the Constitution. Its\r\nlegitimate authority is abundantly sufficient for all the purposes for\r\nwhich it was created and its powers being expressly enumerated, there\r\ncan be no justification for claiming anything beyond them. Every attempt\r\nto exercise power beyond these limits should be promptly and firmly\r\nopposed, for one evil example will lead to other measures still more\r\nmischievous; and if the principle of constructive powers or supposed\r\nadvantages or temporary circumstances shall ever be permitted to justify\r\nthe assumption of a power not given by the Constitution, the General\r\nGovernment will before long absorb all the powers of legislation, and\r\nyou will have in effect but one consolidated government. From the\r\nextent of our country, its diversified interests, different pursuits,\r\nand different habits, it is too obvious for argument that a single\r\nconsolidated government would be wholly inadequate to watch over and\r\nprotect its interests; and every friend of our free institutions should\r\nbe always prepared to maintain unimpaired and in full vigor the rights\r\nand sovereignty of the States and to confine the action of the General\r\nGovernment strictly to the sphere of its appropriate duties.\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no one of the powers conferred on the Federal\r\nGovernment so liable to abuse as the taxing power. The most productive\r\nand convenient sources of revenue were necessarily given to it, that it\r\nmight be able to perform the important duties imposed upon it; and the\r\ntaxes which it lays upon commerce being concealed from the real payer in\r\nthe price of the article, they do not so readily attract the attention\r\nof the people as smaller sums demanded from them directly by the\r\ntaxgatherer. But the tax imposed on goods enhances by so much the price\r\nof the commodity to the consumer, and as many of these duties are\r\nimposed on articles of necessity which are daily used by the great body\r\nof the people, the money raised by these imposts is drawn from their\r\npockets. Congress has no right under the Constitution to take money from\r\nthe people unless it is required to execute some one of the specific\r\npowers intrusted to the Government; and if they raise more than is\r\nnecessary for such purposes, it is an abuse of the power of taxation,\r\nand unjust and oppressive. It may indeed happen that the revenue will\r\nsometimes exceed the amount anticipated when the taxes were laid. When,\r\nhowever, this is ascertained, it is easy to reduce them, and in such a\r\ncase it is unquestionably the duty of the Government to reduce them, for\r\nno circumstances can justify it in assuming a power not given to it by\r\nthe Constitution nor in taking away the money of the people when it is\r\nnot needed for the legitimate wants of the Government.\r\n\r\nPlain as these principles appear to be, you will yet find there is a\r\nconstant effort to induce the General Government to go beyond the limits\r\nof its taxing power and to impose unnecessary burdens upon the people.\r\nMany powerful interests are continually at work to procure heavy duties\r\non commerce and to swell the revenue beyond the real necessities of the\r\npublic service, and the country has already felt the injurious effects\r\nof their combined influence. They succeeded in obtaining a tariff of\r\nduties bearing most oppressively on the agricultural and laboring\r\nclasses of society and producing a revenue that could not be usefully\r\nemployed within the range of the powers conferred upon Congress, and\r\nin order to fasten upon the people this unjust and unequal system of\r\ntaxation extravagant schemes of internal improvement were got up in\r\nvarious quarters to squander the money and to purchase support. Thus\r\none unconstitutional measure was intended to be upheld by another, and\r\nthe abuse of the power of taxation was to be maintained by usurping\r\nthe power of expending the money in internal improvements. You can\r\nnot have forgotten the severe and doubtful struggle through which we\r\npassed when the executive department of the Government by its veto\r\nendeavored to arrest this prodigal scheme of injustice and to bring\r\nback the legislation of Congress to the boundaries prescribed by the\r\nConstitution. The good sense and practical judgment of the people\r\nwhen the subject was brought before them sustained the course of the\r\nExecutive, and this plan of unconstitutional expenditures for the\r\npurposes of corrupt influence is, I trust, finally overthrown.\r\n\r\nThe result of this decision has been felt in the rapid extinguishment of\r\nthe public debt and the large accumulation of a surplus in the Treasury,\r\nnotwithstanding the tariff was reduced and is now very far below the\r\namount originally contemplated by its advocates. But, rely upon it, the\r\ndesign to collect an extravagant revenue and to burden you with taxes\r\nbeyond the economical wants of the Government is not yet abandoned. The\r\nvarious interests which have combined together to impose a heavy tariff\r\nand to produce an overflowing Treasury are too strong and have too\r\nmuch at stake to surrender the contest. The corporations and wealthy\r\nindividuals who are engaged in large manufacturing establishments desire\r\na high tariff to increase their gains. Designing politicians will\r\nsupport it to conciliate their favor and to obtain the means of profuse\r\nexpenditure for the purpose of purchasing influence in other quarters;\r\nand since the people have decided that the Federal Government can not be\r\npermitted to employ its income in internal improvements, efforts will be\r\nmade to seduce and mislead the citizens of the several States by holding\r\nout to them the deceitful prospect of benefits to be derived from a\r\nsurplus revenue collected by the General Government and annually divided\r\namong the States; and if, encouraged by these fallacious hopes, the\r\nStates should disregard the principles of economy which ought to\r\ncharacterize every republican government, and should indulge in lavish\r\nexpenditures exceeding their resources, they will before long find\r\nthemselves oppressed with debts which they are unable to pay, and the\r\ntemptation will become irresistible to support a high tariff in order\r\nto obtain a surplus for distribution. Do not allow yourselves, my\r\nfellow-citizens, to be misled on this subject. The Federal Government\r\ncan not collect a surplus for such purposes without violating the\r\nprinciples of the Constitution and assuming powers which have not been\r\ngranted. It is, moreover, a system of injustice, and if persisted in\r\nwill inevitably lead to corruption, and must end in ruin. The surplus\r\nrevenue will be drawn from the pockets of the people--from the farmer,\r\nthe mechanic, and the laboring classes of society; but who will receive\r\nit when distributed among the States, where it is to be disposed of by\r\nleading State politicians, who have friends to favor and political\r\npartisans to gratify? It will certainly not be returned to those who\r\npaid it and who have most need of it and are honestly entitled to\r\nit. There is but one safe rule, and that is to confine the General\r\nGovernment rigidly within the sphere of its appropriate duties. It\r\nhas no power to raise a revenue or impose taxes except for the purposes\r\nenumerated in the Constitution, and if its income is found to exceed\r\nthese wants it should be forthwith reduced and the burden of the people\r\nso far lightened.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the conflicts which have taken place between different\r\ninterests in the United States and the policy pursued since the adoption\r\nof our present form of Government, we find nothing that has produced\r\nsuch deep-seated evil as the course of legislation in relation to the\r\ncurrency. The Constitution of the United States unquestionably intended\r\nto secure to the people a circulating medium of gold and silver. But the\r\nestablishment of a national bank by Congress, with the privilege of\r\nissuing paper money receivable in the payment of the public dues, and\r\nthe unfortunate course of legislation in the several States upon the\r\nsame subject, drove from general circulation the constitutional currency\r\nand substituted one of paper in its place.\r\n\r\nIt was not easy for men engaged in the ordinary pursuits of business,\r\nwhose attention had not been particularly drawn to the subject, to\r\nforesee all the consequences of a currency exclusively of paper, and we\r\nought not on that account to be surprised at the facility with which\r\nlaws were obtained to carry into effect the paper system. Honest and\r\neven enlightened men are sometimes misled by the specious and plausible\r\nstatements of the designing. But experience has now proved the mischiefs\r\nand dangers of a paper currency, and it rests with you to determine\r\nwhether the proper remedy shall be applied.\r\n\r\nThe paper system being founded on public confidence and having of itself\r\nno intrinsic value, it is liable to great and sudden fluctuations,\r\nthereby rendering property insecure and the wages of labor unsteady and\r\nuncertain. The corporations which create the paper money can not be\r\nrelied upon to keep the circulating medium uniform in amount. In times\r\nof prosperity, when confidence is high, they are tempted by the prospect\r\nof gain or by the influence of those who hope to profit by it to extend\r\ntheir issues of paper beyond the bounds of discretion and the reasonable\r\ndemands of business; and when these issues have been pushed on from day\r\nto day, until public confidence is at length shaken, then a reaction\r\ntakes place, and they immediately withdraw the credits they have given,\r\nsuddenly curtail their issues, and produce an unexpected and ruinous\r\ncontraction of the circulating medium, which is felt by the whole\r\ncommunity. The banks by this means save themselves, and the mischievous\r\nconsequences of their imprudence or cupidity are visited upon the\r\npublic. Nor does the evil stop here. These ebbs and flows in the\r\ncurrency and these indiscreet extensions of credit naturally engender\r\na spirit of speculation injurious to the habits and character of\r\nthe people. We have already seen its effects in the wild spirit of\r\nspeculation in the public lands and various kinds of stock which within\r\nthe last year or two seized upon such a multitude of our citizens and\r\nthreatened to pervade all classes of society and to withdraw their\r\nattention from the sober pursuits of honest industry. It is not by\r\nencouraging this spirit that we shall best preserve public virtue\r\nand promote the true interests of our country; but if your currency\r\ncontinues as exclusively paper as it now is, it will foster this eager\r\ndesire to amass wealth without labor; it will multiply the number of\r\ndependents on bank accommodations and bank favors; the temptation to\r\nobtain money at any sacrifice will become stronger and stronger, and\r\ninevitably lead to corruption, which will find its way into your public\r\ncouncils and destroy at no distant day the purity of your Government.\r\nSome of the evils which arise from this system of paper press with\r\npeculiar hardship upon the class of society least able to bear it.\r\nA portion of this currency frequently becomes depreciated or worthless,\r\nand all of it is easily counterfeited in such a manner as to require\r\npeculiar skill and much experience to distinguish the counterfeit from\r\nthe genuine note. These frauds are most generally perpetrated in the\r\nsmaller notes, which are used in the daily transactions of ordinary\r\nbusiness, and the losses occasioned by them are commonly thrown upon the\r\nlaboring classes of society, whose situation and pursuits put it out of\r\ntheir power to guard themselves from these impositions, and whose daily\r\nwages are necessary for their subsistence. It is the duty of every\r\ngovernment so to regulate its currency as to protect this numerous\r\nclass, as far as practicable, from the impositions of avarice and\r\nfraud. It is more especially the duty of the United States, where the\r\nGovernment is emphatically the Government of the people, and where this\r\nrespectable portion of our citizens are so proudly distinguished from\r\nthe laboring classes of all other nations by their independent spirit,\r\ntheir love of liberty, their intelligence, and their high tone of moral\r\ncharacter. Their industry in peace is the source of our wealth and their\r\nbravery in war has covered us with glory; and the Government of the\r\nUnited States will but ill discharge its duties if it leaves them a prey\r\nto such dishonest impositions. Yet it is evident that their interests\r\ncan not be effectually protected unless silver and gold are restored\r\nto circulation.\r\n\r\nThese views alone of the paper currency are sufficient to call for\r\nimmediate reform; but there is another consideration which should still\r\nmore strongly press it upon your attention.\r\n\r\nRecent events have proved that the paper-money system of this country\r\nmay be used as an engine to undermine your free institutions, and that\r\nthose who desire to engross all power in the hands of the few and to\r\ngovern by corruption or force are aware of its power and prepared to\r\nemploy it. Your banks now furnish your only circulating medium, and\r\nmoney is plenty or scarce according to the quantity of notes issued by\r\nthem. While they have capitals not greatly disproportioned to each\r\nother, they are competitors in business, and no one of them can exercise\r\ndominion over the rest; and although in the present state of the\r\ncurrency these banks may and do operate injuriously upon the habits of\r\nbusiness, the pecuniary concerns, and the moral tone of society, yet,\r\nfrom their number and dispersed situation, they can not combine for the\r\npurposes of political influence, and whatever may be the dispositions\r\nof some of them their power of mischief must necessarily be confined\r\nto a narrow space and felt only in their immediate neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nBut when the charter for the Bank of the United States was obtained\r\nfrom Congress it perfected the schemes of the paper system and gave\r\nto its advocates the position they have struggled to obtain from the\r\ncommencement of the Federal Government to the present hour. The immense\r\ncapital and peculiar privileges bestowed upon it enabled it to exercise\r\ndespotic sway over the other banks in every part of the country. From\r\nits superior strength it could seriously injure, if not destroy, the\r\nbusiness of any one of them which might incur its resentment; and\r\nit openly claimed for itself the power of regulating the currency\r\nthroughout the United States. In other words, it asserted (and it\r\nundoubtedly possessed) the power to make money plenty or scarce at its\r\npleasure, at any time and in any quarter of the Union, by controlling\r\nthe issues of other banks and permitting an expansion or compelling\r\na general contraction of the circulating medium, according to its own\r\nwill. The other banking institutions were sensible of its strength, and\r\nthey soon generally became its obedient instruments, ready at all times\r\nto execute its mandates; and with the banks necessarily went also that\r\nnumerous class of persons in our commercial cities who depend altogether\r\non bank credits for their solvency and means of business, and who are\r\ntherefore obliged, for their own safety, to propitiate the favor of\r\nthe money power by distinguished zeal and devotion in its service.\r\nThe result of the ill-advised legislation which established this great\r\nmonopoly was to concentrate the whole moneyed power of the Union, with\r\nits boundless means of corruption and its numerous dependents, under the\r\ndirection and command of one acknowledged head, thus organizing this\r\nparticular interest as one body and securing to it unity and concert of\r\naction throughout the United States, and enabling it to bring forward\r\nupon any occasion its entire and undivided strength to support or defeat\r\nany measure of the Government. In the hands of this formidable power,\r\nthus perfectly organized, was also placed unlimited dominion over the\r\namount of the circulating medium, giving it the power to regulate the\r\nvalue of property and the fruits of labor in every quarter of the Union,\r\nand to bestow prosperity or bring ruin upon any city or section of the\r\ncountry as might best comport with its own interest or policy.\r\n\r\nWe are not left to conjecture how the moneyed power, thus organized and\r\nwith such a weapon in its hands, would be likely to use it. The distress\r\nand alarm which pervaded and agitated the whole country when the Bank\r\nof the United States waged war upon the people in order to compel them\r\nto submit to its demands can not yet be forgotten. The ruthless and\r\nunsparing temper with which whole cities and communities were oppressed,\r\nindividuals impoverished and ruined, and a scene of cheerful prosperity\r\nsuddenly changed into one of gloom and despondency ought to be indelibly\r\nimpressed on the memory of the people of the United States. If such was\r\nits power in a time of peace, what would it not have been in a season\r\nof war, with an enemy at your doors? No nation but the freemen of the\r\nUnited States could have come out victorious from such a contest; yet,\r\nif you had not conquered, the Government would have passed from the\r\nhands of the many to the hands of the few, and this organized money\r\npower from its secret conclave would have dictated the choice of your\r\nhighest officers and compelled you to make peace or war, as best suited\r\ntheir own wishes. The forms of your Government might for a time have\r\nremained, but its living spirit would have departed from it.\r\n\r\nThe distress and sufferings inflicted on the people by the bank are some\r\nof the fruits of that system of policy which is continually striving to\r\nenlarge the authority of the Federal Government beyond the limits fixed\r\nby the Constitution. The powers enumerated in that instrument do not\r\nconfer on Congress the right to establish such a corporation as the Bank\r\nof the United States, and the evil consequences which followed may warn\r\nus of the danger of departing from the true rule of construction and of\r\npermitting temporary circumstances or the hope of better promoting the\r\npublic welfare to influence in any degree our decisions upon the extent\r\nof the authority of the General Government. Let us abide by the\r\nConstitution as it is written, or amend it in the constitutional mode\r\nif it is found to be defective.\r\n\r\nThe severe lessons of experience will, I doubt not, be sufficient to\r\nprevent Congress from again chartering such a monopoly, even if the\r\nConstitution did not present an insuperable objection to it. But you\r\nmust remember, my fellow-citizens, that eternal vigilance by the people\r\nis the price of liberty, and that you must pay the price if you wish to\r\nsecure the blessing. It behooves you, therefore, to be watchful in your\r\nStates as well as in the Federal Government. The power which the moneyed\r\ninterest can exercise, when concentrated under a single head and with\r\nour present system of currency, was sufficiently demonstrated in the\r\nstruggle made by the Bank of the United States. Defeated in the General\r\nGovernment, the same class of intriguers and politicians will now resort\r\nto the States and endeavor to obtain there the same organization which\r\nthey failed to perpetuate in the Union; and with specious and deceitful\r\nplans of public advantages and State interests and State pride they will\r\nendeavor to establish in the different States one moneyed institution\r\nwith overgrown capital and exclusive privileges sufficient to enable it\r\nto control the operations of the other banks. Such an institution will\r\nbe pregnant with the same evils produced by the Bank of the United\r\nStates, although its sphere of action is more confined, and in the State\r\nin which it is chartered the money power will be able to embody its\r\nwhole strength and to move together with undivided force to accomplish\r\nany object it may wish to attain. You have already had abundant evidence\r\nof its power to inflict injury upon the agricultural, mechanical, and\r\nlaboring classes of society, and over those whose engagements in trade\r\nor speculation render them dependent on bank facilities the dominion of\r\nthe State monopoly will be absolute and their obedience unlimited. With\r\nsuch a bank and a paper currency the money power would in a few years\r\ngovern the State and control its measures, and if a sufficient number of\r\nStates can be induced to create such establishments the time will soon\r\ncome when it will again take the field against the United States and\r\nsucceed in perfecting and perpetuating its organization by a charter\r\nfrom Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the serious evils of our present system of banking that it\r\nenables one class of society--and that by no means a numerous one--by\r\nits control over the currency, to act injuriously upon the interests\r\nof all the others and to exercise more than its just proportion of\r\ninfluence in political affairs. The agricultural, the mechanical, and\r\nthe laboring classes have little or no share in the direction of the\r\ngreat moneyed corporations, and from their habits and the nature of\r\ntheir pursuits they are incapable of forming extensive combinations to\r\nact together with united force. Such concert of action may sometimes be\r\nproduced in a single city or in a small district of country by means of\r\npersonal communications with each other, but they have no regular or\r\nactive correspondence with those who are engaged in similar pursuits\r\nin distant places; they have but little patronage to give to the press,\r\nand exercise but a small share of influence over it; they have no crowd\r\nof dependents about them who hope to grow rich without labor by their\r\ncountenance and favor, and who are therefore always ready to execute\r\ntheir wishes. The planter, the farmer, the mechanic, and the laborer all\r\nknow that their success depends upon their own industry and economy, and\r\nthat they must not expect to become suddenly rich by the fruits of their\r\ntoil. Yet these classes of society form the great body of the people of\r\nthe United States; they are the bone and sinew of the country--men who\r\nlove liberty and desire nothing but equal rights and equal laws, and\r\nwho, moreover, hold the great mass of our national wealth, although it\r\nis distributed in moderate amounts among the millions of freemen who\r\npossess it. But with overwhelming numbers and wealth on their side they\r\nare in constant danger of losing their fair influence in the Government,\r\nand with difficulty maintain their just rights against the incessant\r\nefforts daily made to encroach upon them. The mischief springs from the\r\npower which the moneyed interest derives from a paper currency which\r\nthey are able to control, from the multitude of corporations with\r\nexclusive privileges which they have succeeded in obtaining in the\r\ndifferent States, and which are employed altogether for their benefit;\r\nand unless you become more watchful in your States and check this spirit\r\nof monopoly and thirst for exclusive privileges you will in the end find\r\nthat the most important powers of Government have been given or bartered\r\naway, and the control over your dearest interests has passed into the\r\nhands of these corporations.\r\n\r\nThe paper-money system and its natural associations--monopoly and\r\nexclusive privileges--have already struck their roots too deep in the\r\nsoil, and it will require all your efforts to check its further growth\r\nand to eradicate the evil. The men who profit by the abuses and desire\r\nto perpetuate them will continue to besiege the halls of legislation in\r\nthe General Government as well as in the States, and will seek by every\r\nartifice to mislead and deceive the public servants. It is to yourselves\r\nthat you must look for safety and the means of guarding and perpetuating\r\nyour free institutions. In your hands is rightfully placed the\r\nsovereignty of the country, and to you everyone placed in authority\r\nis ultimately responsible. It is always in your power to see that the\r\nwishes of the people are carried into faithful execution, and their\r\nwill, when once made known, must sooner or later be obeyed; and\r\nwhile the people remain, as I trust they ever will, uncorrupted and\r\nincorruptible, and continue watchful and jealous of their rights, the\r\nGovernment is safe, and the cause of freedom will continue to triumph\r\nover all its enemies.\r\n\r\nBut it will require steady and persevering exertions on your part to rid\r\nyourselves of the iniquities and mischiefs of the paper system and to\r\ncheck the spirit of monopoly and other abuses which have sprung up with\r\nit, and of which it is the main support. So many interests are united\r\nto resist all reform on this subject that you must not hope the conflict\r\nwill be a short one nor success easy. My humble efforts have not\r\nbeen spared during my administration of the Government to restore the\r\nconstitutional currency of gold and silver, and something, I trust, has\r\nbeen done toward the accomplishment of this most desirable object; but\r\nenough yet remains to require all your energy and perseverance. The\r\npower, however, is in your hands, and the remedy must and will be\r\napplied if you determine upon it.\r\n\r\nWhile I am thus endeavoring to press upon your attention the principles\r\nwhich I deem of vital importance in the domestic concerns of the\r\ncountry, I ought not to pass over without notice the important\r\nconsiderations which should govern your policy toward foreign powers.\r\nIt is unquestionably our true interest to cultivate the most friendly\r\nunderstanding with every nation and to avoid by every honorable means\r\nthe calamities of war, and we shall best attain this object by frankness\r\nand sincerity in our foreign intercourse, by the prompt and faithful\r\nexecution of treaties, and by justice and impartiality in our conduct\r\nto all. But no nation, however desirous of peace, can hope to escape\r\noccasional collisions with other powers, and the soundest dictates of\r\npolicy require that we should place ourselves in a condition to assert\r\nour rights if a resort to force should ever become necessary. Our local\r\nsituation, our long line of seacoast, indented by numerous bays, with\r\ndeep rivers opening into the interior, as well as our extended and still\r\nincreasing commerce, point to the Navy as our natural means of defense.\r\nIt will in the end be found to be the cheapest and most effectual, and\r\nnow is the time, in a season of peace and with an overflowing revenue,\r\nthat we can year after year add to its strength without increasing the\r\nburdens of the people. It is your true policy, for your Navy will not\r\nonly protect your rich and flourishing commerce in distant seas, but\r\nwill enable you to reach and annoy the enemy and will give to defense\r\nits greatest efficiency by meeting danger at a distance from home. It\r\nis impossible by any line of fortifications to guard every point from\r\nattack against a hostile force advancing from the ocean and selecting\r\nits object, but they are indispensable to protect cities from\r\nbombardment, dockyards and naval arsenals from destruction, to give\r\nshelter to merchant vessels in time of war and to single ships or\r\nweaker squadrons when pressed by superior force. Fortifications of this\r\ndescription can not be too soon completed and armed and placed in a\r\ncondition of the most perfect preparation. The abundant means we now\r\npossess can not be applied in any manner more useful to the country, and\r\nwhen this is done and our naval force sufficiently strengthened and our\r\nmilitia armed we need not fear that any nation will wantonly insult us\r\nor needlessly provoke hostilities. We shall more certainly preserve\r\npeace when it is well understood that we are prepared for war.\r\n\r\nIn presenting to you, my fellow-citizens, these parting counsels, I\r\nhave brought before you the leading principles upon which I endeavored\r\nto administer the Government in the high office with which you twice\r\nhonored me. Knowing that the path of freedom is continually beset by\r\nenemies who often assume the disguise of friends, I have devoted the\r\nlast hours of my public life to warn you of the dangers. The progress of\r\nthe United States under our free and happy institutions has surpassed\r\nthe most sanguine hopes of the founders of the Republic. Our growth\r\nhas been rapid beyond all former example in numbers, in wealth, in\r\nknowledge, and all the useful arts which contribute to the comforts and\r\nconvenience of man, and from the earliest ages of history to the present\r\nday there never have been thirteen millions of people associated in one\r\npolitical body who enjoyed so much freedom and happiness as the people\r\nof these United States. You have no longer any cause to fear danger from\r\nabroad; your strength and power are well known throughout the civilized\r\nworld, as well as the high and gallant bearing of your sons. It is\r\nfrom within, among yourselves--from cupidity, from corruption, from\r\ndisappointed ambition and inordinate thirst for power--that factions\r\nwill be formed and liberty endangered. It is against such designs,\r\nwhatever disguise the actors may assume, that you have especially to\r\nguard yourselves. You have the highest of human trusts committed to your\r\ncare. Providence has showered on this favored land blessings without\r\nnumber, and has chosen you as the guardians of freedom, to preserve it\r\nfor the benefit of the human race. May He who holds in His hands the\r\ndestinies of nations make you worthy of the favors He has bestowed and\r\nenable you, with pure hearts and pure hands and sleepless vigilance, to\r\nguard and defend to the end of time the great charge He has committed\r\nto your keeping.\r\n\r\nMy own race is nearly run; advanced age and failing health warn me that\r\nbefore long I must pass beyond the reach of human events and cease to\r\nfeel the vicissitudes of human affairs. I thank God that my life has\r\nbeen spent in a land of liberty and that He has given me a heart to love\r\nmy country with the affection of a son. And filled with gratitude for\r\nyour constant and unwavering kindness, I bid you a last and affectionate\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.",
