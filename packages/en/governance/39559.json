Houghton and Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1866 Carlyle said: \"The only man appointed by God to be His\r\nviceregent here on earth in these days, and knowing he was so appointed\r\nand bent with his whole soul on doing, and able to do God's work,\" is M.\r\nde Bismarck. If this be true, then M. de Bismarck has found a most\r\nvaluable ally and colleague in the present Premier of Russia. It is of\r\nthese two men, Prince Bismarck, and Prince Gortchakof, the Chancellor of\r\nGermany, and the Chancellor of all the Russias, that this book treats.\r\nThe author is M. Julian Klaczko, a Polish refugee, a man of cosmopolitan\r\nhabits, an accomplished and able writer, thoroughly acquainted with the\r\ncontemporaneous history of Europe, prejudiced against Prussia, an ardent\r\nfriend of Austria, and devoted to a conservative and monarchical form of\r\ngovernment. He was always the friend of Poland. In 1863 he defended\r\nDenmark in a series of able papers, which came out in the \"Revue des\r\ndeux Mondes,\" under the title of \"Studies of Contemporaneous Diplomacy.\"\r\nAfter the battle of Sadowa, he appeared as the friend of Austria in a\r\nwork entitled, \"The Preliminaries of Sadowa.\" Count de Beust summoned\r\nhim to Vienna, and attached him to the Foreign Office. Klaczko was then\r\nelected Deputy in the Polish province of Galicia. After 1870 he resigned\r\nhis posts and returned to France.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Two Chancellors\" he has given a condensed but graphic review of\r\nthe diplomatic history of Europe from 1855 to 1871, and a sketch of the\r\nlives of Prince Bismarck and Prince Gortchakof, the two most eminent men\r\nof the day. He also seeks to prove that the \"disaster\" of Sadowa,\r\nfollowed by the still greater one of Sedan, was brought about by the\r\nblind devotion of Prince Gortchakof to Prince Bismarck, aided largely,\r\nit is true, by the \"inconceivable vacillations and hallucinations of\r\nNapoleon III., the Dreamer of Ham.\" In a word, he seeks to establish\r\nthat the prodigious events of the last ten years are due to a conspiracy\r\nbetween Russia and Prussia. This is a one-sided, partial view, but is\r\npresented with such power as will almost persuade the reader that such\r\nmay have been the case. According to Klaczko's theories, Prussia has\r\ngrasped the substance and Russia the shadow, and the old chancellor of\r\nthe great empire of the North has been the dupe of his pupil of Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe great changes which will undoubtedly soon take place in the East,\r\nmake M. Klaczko's views as to the past and present relations between\r\nGermany and Russia of marked interest, and the student of\r\ncontemporaneous history will find in the \"Two Chancellors,\"\r\nnotwithstanding the peculiar views and strong prejudices of the writer,\r\none of the most instructive as well as interesting works that have\r\nappeared for many years. It has been issued in book form in Paris, and\r\nwidely circulated in Russia, where it has caused a profound sensation.\r\n\r\nIn the translation I have endeavored to reproduce as justly as possible\r\nthe words of M. Klaczko, whose style, though strong and forcible, is at\r\ntimes somewhat involved. With these few words in regard to the\r\nimportance of the subject and the character of the author, I leave to\r\nthe judgment of the reader the account of the momentous events which may\r\nbe truly said to have changed the political face of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            PAGE\r\n    I.\r\n\r\n    THE MISSIONS OF PRINCE GORTCHAKOF AND THE DEBUTS\r\n    OF M.

DE BISMARCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe good old Plutarch, in commencing his long and charming series of\r\nParallels with the account of the lives of Theseus and Romulus,\r\nexperiences some difficulty in justifying such an association of the two\r\nheroes; he can find in them only very vague traits of resemblance, and\r\nthese by no means striking. \"To strength they both joined great powers\r\nof mind, both carried off women by violence, and the one as well as the\r\nother was not exempted from domestic miseries; indeed, toward the end of\r\ntheir lives they both aroused the hatred of their fellow-citizens.\"[1]\r\nWithout doubt a writer of our day, wishing to give a comparative study\r\nof the two most prominent figures of contemporaneous politics, the\r\nchancellors of Russia and Germany, would only mislead in giving\r\nprominence to such points of resemblance. The association in this case\r\nis justifiable, for it suggests itself to every contemplative mind, to\r\nwhoever has meditated on the events of the last fifteen or twenty years.\r\nThe modern Plutarch who would undertake to write the lives of these two\r\nillustrious men, could, as it seems to us, easily resist the temptation\r\nof searching too deeply for, or forcing analogies in a subject where\r\nsimilarities abound and are so striking. Perhaps he would rather have to\r\nguard against necessary and tiresome repetitions in presence of a\r\ncommonalty of ideas and of a harmony of action such as history has\r\nrarely known in two ministers guiding two different empires.\r\n\r\nIt is not, the reader may be well assured, a work of this sort which the\r\nauthor has undertaken in the following pages. We have only given the\r\nmere sketch of a picture which, to be even in a slight degree full and\r\nsatisfactory, would have required much larger proportions, and above all\r\na much more skillful hand. Without pretending to present here new and\r\nunpublished materials, or indeed to reunite all those which are already\r\nknown, we have simply chosen a few, and tried to assort and arrange them\r\nso as to afford a better perspective. We have been obliged to renounce\r\nthe wish to give to the different parts an equality of design and depth\r\nof coloring, and we have not even bound ourselves to follow a very\r\nregular and methodical course in this narration. Before a subject so\r\nvast and presenting so many shades and shadows, we have thought that it\r\nwas permissible, that it was indeed occasionally useful, to vary the\r\npoints of observation and to present it in different aspects.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nLike the Odoiefski, the Obolenski, the Dolgorouki, and many aristocratic\r\nfamilies on the banks of the Moscova and the Neva, the Gortchakof also\r\npride themselves on their descent from the Rourik; to speak more\r\nplainly, they claim to trace their origin from one of the sons of\r\nMichael, Grand Duke of Tchernigof, put to death towards the middle of\r\nthe thirteenth century by the Mongolians of Batou Khan, since proclaimed\r\nmartyr of the faith, exalted, indeed, among the saints of the Orthodox\r\nChurch. One meets, nevertheless, with but few illustrious bearers of the\r\nname of Gortchakof in the gloomy and exciting annals of old Russia. In\r\nthe epoch which preceded the accession of the Romanof, there lived a\r\ncertain Peter Ivanovitch Gortchakof, the unfortunate commander of\r\nSmolenski, who surrendered this celebrated place to the Poles after two\r\nyears of energetic and desperate resistance. He was taken to Warsaw, and\r\nthere, in 1611, with the Czar Vassili, the two princes Schouyski,\r\nSehine, and a number of powerful _boiars_, he was forced to take part in\r\nthe famous \"_cortege_ of captives\" which the grand constable Zolkiweski\r\npresented one day--_honorificentissime_, says the chronicle of the\r\ntimes--to the king and the senate of the most serene republic. It was\r\nonly in the second half of the last century, under the reign of\r\nCatherine II., that a Prince Ivan Gortchakof succeeded (thanks\r\nespecially to his marriage with a sister of the opulent and courageous\r\nSouvorof) in again raising the glory of his old house, which has never\r\nsince ceased to distinguish itself in the different branches of state\r\nservice, principally in the career of arms. The France of to-day has\r\npreserved the memory of two Princes Gortchakof, two old soldiers of\r\nBorodino who distinguished themselves during the war of the Orient. The\r\none commanded the left wing of the Russian troops at the battles of\r\nAlma and Inkermann; the other, Prince Michael, was the generalissimo of\r\nthe armies of the czar in the Crimea, and rendered his name imperishable\r\nby the heroic defense of Sebastopol. Afterwards he governed the Kingdom\r\nof Poland as lieutenant of the emperor, and became therefore (strange\r\nexample of the vicissitudes of history!) the supreme representative of a\r\nharsh, foreign government in this same city of Warsaw, where one of his\r\nancestors had formerly figured in a memorable procession of the\r\nvanquished. However, if this circumstance ever occurred to Prince\r\nMichael, he drew therefrom none but suggestions worthy of his character;\r\nhe governed the conquered country with moderation and benevolence, and\r\nleft behind him the fame of a man as just in civil administration as he\r\nwas intrepid in war.\r\n\r\nThe cousin of Prince Michael and present chancellor of the empire,\r\nAlexander Mikhailovitch Gortchakof, was born in 1798, and was educated\r\nin that lyceum of Zarkoe-Zeloe which has its distinct place in the\r\npedagogic history of Russia. Founded by Catherine II. as a model\r\neducational establishment for the aristocratic youth of the empire, the\r\nlyceum shone with great _eclat_ under the reign of Alexander I.,\r\nalthough the Rollin and the Pestalozzi would certainly have had more\r\nthan one reservation to make with respect to a college which only\r\nmoulded its scholars for the world, and thought the vigorous classical\r\nstudies a burden too heavy to carry into the ethereal spheres of\r\npleasures and elegance. Almost all the professors of the establishment\r\nwere foreigners, men marked with the stamp of the eighteenth century,\r\nacute minds, slightly frivolous, and above all disciples of Voltaire.\r\nThe most eminent among them, the professor of French literature, he who\r\ninitiated the future chancellor into the language of Voltaire, of which\r\nhe so well knew the subtleties, was a Genevese, who, under the\r\ninoffensive name of M. de Boudry, concealed another of a terrible\r\nsignificance. M. de Boudry was the brother of Marat, that \"_sinistre\r\nconventionnel_.\"[2] The Empress Catherine, in order \"to end a scandal,\"\r\nhad forced this patronymic change on M. Marat, without, however,\r\nsucceeding in making him change his opinions, which always remained\r\n\"Jacobin.\" He died in final impenitence, cherishing an openly avowed\r\nadmiration for _the friend of the people_, unjustly calumniated. From\r\nthis education of very doubtful value, the young Gortchakof succeeded in\r\nextracting a strong and useful substance. He left Zarkoe-Zeloe with\r\nvarious and solid acquirements; a surprising matter, he was even a good\r\nLatinist, and this last fact has remained a cause of amazement to his\r\nfellow-scholars as well as to the generations who followed. It is\r\ncertain, however, that the chancellor could quote Horace with about the\r\nsame appropriateness as Louis XVIII. of sainted memory. One of his best\r\nknown dispatches ingeniously borrows from Suetonius an eloquent passage\r\non the distinction to be established between liberty and anarchy.\r\n\r\nNext to his classical attainments, that part of his youth which the\r\nchancellor loves especially to recall is that he was the fellow-scholar,\r\nand that he remained the friend, of the great national poet, Pouchkine,\r\na fact more to his honor inasmuch as this friendship has brought with\r\nit embarrassments at certain times. When, by the order of the Emperor\r\nAlexander I., in consequence of an offensive ode, which one is not now\r\nknown, the young singer of \"Rouslan\" and \"Loudmila\" was confined in an\r\nobscure village in the far interior of Russia, only two of his former\r\ncomrades at the lyceum had the courage to go to see and offer him their\r\ncondolence, and one of these intrepid youths was Prince Gortchakof. One\r\nfinds in the work of Pouchkine some verses written in a lively and\r\nplayful style, and which only derive their interest from the name of\r\nAlexander Mikhailovitch, to whom they are addressed. In one of these\r\njuvenile pieces, Pouchkine wishes his friend \"to have Cupid as an\r\ninseparable companion as far as the banks of the Styx, and to go to\r\nsleep on the bosom of Helen in the very boat of Charon.\" Thoughtless\r\nwishes, which human malignity would surely not have failed to carry out\r\nin the end, if very fortunately the chancellor had not been able to\r\npreserve his old days from every deceitful seduction, and to avoid even\r\nthe appearance of an arctic Ruy Gomez. The inspiration of the poet was\r\nhappier another time, when, speaking of their different vocations, he\r\npredicts for Alexander Mikhailovitch a splendid destiny, and calls him\r\n\"the beloved child of fortune.\"\r\n\r\nFortune was nevertheless slow to recognize its child, and to give him\r\nthe lot which he merited. Having early entered the department of foreign\r\naffairs, being attached to the _suite_ of M. de Nesselrode at the time\r\nof the Congresses of Laybach and Verona, Prince Gortchakof had already\r\nlong passed that period which Dante calls the _mezzo del cammin di\r\nvita_; and even when very near his fiftieth year, was still only a\r\nminister plenipotentiary at a little court in Germany. A fortunate event\r\nat last came to commend him to the kindness of his master, and to render\r\nhim distinguished in those diplomatic circles, in those regions \"free\r\nfrom tears, but filled with sighs,\" which in the language of diplomacy\r\nare called the secondary posts.\r\n\r\nIn a moment of paternal weakness, the Emperor Nicholas had one day\r\nconsented to the union of his daughter, the Grand Duchess Marie, with\r\nthe Duke of Leuchtenberg, \"the son of a Beauharnais, a Catholic officer\r\nin the service of the King of Bavaria,\" as was whispered with sadness in\r\nthe intimate circles of the winter palace. Nicholas was not the man to\r\nretract his given word, but not the less did he feel the sting of what\r\nhis surrounding court did not cease to call a _mesalliance_; and the\r\nbitterness increased when none of the foreign members of the imperial\r\nfamily came to take part in the brilliant festivities which preceded or\r\nfollowed the nuptial ceremony. Ill-luck would have it that soon\r\nafterwards a first cousin of the new imperial son-in-law and daughter of\r\nthe ex-King Jerome married a Russian grown rich in trade, a prince in\r\nthe valley of the Arno but scarcely a gentleman on the banks of the\r\nNeva,--a disagreeable accident, and which, according to the amazed\r\ncourtiers, made the autocrat of all the Russias _the relation of one of\r\nhis subjects_! It became necessary to efface all these unpleasant\r\nimpressions, and to take, by a brilliant alliance, an incontestable\r\nrevenge for so many vexations. It was hoped for a moment to be able to\r\nmarry the Grand Duchess Alexandra to an arch-duke of Austria, but it was\r\nnecessary to fall back on a prince of Darmstadt; for the Grand Duchess\r\nOlga, the most beautiful and the most beloved of the emperor's\r\ndaughters, had been chosen by the only prince royal then unengaged, the\r\npresumptive heir to the throne of Wuertemberg, of the old and illustrious\r\nhouse of Suabia.\r\n\r\nThe plan was not easily executed. The good Suabian people had little\r\nliking for it. A Russian marriage made it tremble for its constitutional\r\nliberties; and what was a graver matter, the old King William of\r\nWuertemberg, a good, liberal sovereign, but obstinate in all things,\r\nshowed himself rather reluctant, and at his own pleasure retarded the\r\nnegotiation. Other objections came from other sides still; but the\r\nRussian minister plenipotentiary at Stuttgart, the old fellow-scholar of\r\nPouchkine, knew how to overcome them all with consummate skill. By aid\r\nof art and address, he was able to establish the Grand Duchess Olga in\r\nthe royal family of Wuertemberg. The joy of the Emperor Nicholas was\r\ngreat and unreserved, and the winter palace sang the panegyrics of the\r\nwonderful diplomat. After such a success, Prince Gortchakof could well\r\ndemand to be promoted in his career, having approached nearer by several\r\nstrides towards that embassy of Vienna which was considered as the\r\nsupreme goal of ambition. He did nothing of this sort, however, and\r\nshowed an admirable patience,--the patience of the patriarch Jacob with\r\nLaban, son of Nahor. To the four years which he had already passed at\r\nStuttgart, Alexander Mikhailovitch declared himself ready to add another\r\nterm more prolonged if it were necessary. He promised the empress-mother\r\nto remain indefinitely by the side of the Grand Duchess Olga, to aid her\r\nas a guide and counselor in a foreign country and in the midst of\r\nsurroundings entirely new to her. Barren as the soil might be, he did\r\nnot despair of growing there under this ray of beauty and of grace,\r\nwhich came directly from the great boreal sun; and in truth he kept this\r\npost at Stuttgart for eight more long years. _Tenues grandia conamur!_\r\n\r\nHowever, any point of observation is good for one who understands how to\r\nadjust his glass and question the stars. The resident minister at\r\nStuttgart had extensive information and found means of informing his\r\ngovernment of many things quite outside the limits of the horizon of the\r\nlittle kingdom of Wuertemberg. Soon the year 1848 came with its terrible\r\ncatastrophes, with its great revolutionary earthquakes which added to\r\nthe experience of the most experienced, which lightened with a sudden\r\nglimmer the ignorant depths of human nature, and, in the words of\r\nMilton, lightened the darkness. Such a lesson of history was not without\r\nprofit, one can well believe, to the former scholar of Zarkoe-Zeloe. The\r\n_salons_ and the cabinets for a long time had had no secrets from him;\r\nhe now knew those of the forum and of the cross-roads. The vicinity of\r\nFrankfort, seat of the famous parliament, permitted him to study closely\r\nand fully the German agitation of this memorable epoch; he understood\r\nbeforehand the phases, by turns _naive_, burlesque, and odious, and was\r\nable to predict in good time the unfailing miscarriage of a revolution,\r\nthe subdued billows of which foamed for a day even in the streets of\r\nStuttgart, ordinarily so peaceful.\r\n\r\nIt was in the month of April, 1849. Preceding by twenty years the great\r\nwork of 1870, the parliament of Frankfort had just formed a German\r\nEmpire to the exclusion of Austria, and offered the crown to the King of\r\nPrussia, Frederick William IV. The King of Prussia hesitated, and ended\r\nby declining; the other German princes were still less willing to assent\r\nto a decree which implied their abdication; but this was by no means the\r\nplan of the German demagogy. It suddenly fell enthusiastically in love\r\nwith this constitution, which on the very eve before it had denounced as\r\nreactionary, fatal to the liberties of the people, and designed to\r\nimpose by force the Prussian vassalage decreed at Frankfort on different\r\nsovereigns of Germany. In Wuertemberg, the chamber of deputies voted a\r\npressing, imperious address in order to draw from the king the\r\nrecognition of the Emperor Frederick William IV. The monarch replied by\r\na refusal. The riot thundered on the public square, and the members of\r\nthe court were forced to seek refuge at Ludwigsburg, fleeing from an\r\nenraged capital. \"I will not submit to the House of Hohenzollern,\" the\r\nold King William of Wuertemberg had said to the deputation of the\r\nchamber. \"I owe it to my people and to myself. It is not for myself that\r\nI speak thus; I have but very few years to live. My duty to my country,\r\nmy House, my family, forces this course of action on me.\" Alexander\r\nMikhailovitch, touched by these agitating scenes, by this pathetic\r\nprotestation of the father-in-law of Olga, \"for the House, for the\r\nfamily of Wuertemberg,\" assuredly had then but little expectation that\r\none day, as Chancellor of the Russian Empire, he would become the most\r\nuseful auxiliary, the firmest aid of an aggressive, audacious policy,\r\ndestined to realize in every particular the plan of the rioters of\r\nStuttgart, and to make Queen Olga the vassal of Hohenzollern.\r\n\r\nThis was, however, nothing but the noisy prologue of a drama yet far\r\ndistant, and the year 1850 could indeed rejoice at seeing disappear in\r\nGermany the very last traces of an agitation which had done nothing but\r\nastonish Europe, instead of illuminating and warning it. Towards the end\r\nof this year, 1850, the German Confederacy was established anew under\r\nthe terms of the ancient treaty of Vienna. The _Bundestag_ again\r\ncommenced its peaceable deliberations, and Prince Gortchakof was quite\r\nnaturally appointed to represent the Russian Government at the Diet of\r\nFrankfort. Alexander Mikhailovitch henceforth had his marked place in a\r\ngreat centre of political affairs, where the personal merit of the\r\nminister borrowed a peculiar _eclat_ from the extraordinary fortune\r\nwhich the latest events had created for his august master. Russian\r\ninfluence, at all times very considerable with the ruling houses of\r\nGermany, had grown prodigiously, having reached its zenith, one will\r\nremember, after the disorders of February. Alone remaining sheltered\r\nfrom the revolutionary tempest which had swept over almost all the\r\nStates of the Continent, the empire of the czars appeared to be at that\r\ntime the firmest stronghold of the principles of order and conservatism.\r\n\"Humiliate yourselves, nations, God is with us!\" said the Emperor\r\nNicholas in a celebrated proclamation; and without being too much\r\noffended at language which made God in a manner the accessory to a great\r\nhuman boast, monarchical Europe had only acclamations for a prince who,\r\nafter all, worked with a remarkable disinterestedness for the\r\nreestablishment of the legitimate authorities, and for the maintenance\r\nof the equilibrium of the world.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is just to acknowledge that in these troubled years of\r\n1848-50, the autocrat of the North used his influence, as also his\r\nsword, only to strengthen the tottering thrones and to enforce respect\r\nfor the treaties. He effectively protected Denmark, towards which from\r\nthis epoch the rapacious hand of Germany was stretched, and he was the\r\nmost ardent in calling a meeting of the Powers, which ended by snatching\r\nfrom the Germans the coveted prey. He interposed directly in Hungary,\r\nand with his military forces helped put down a formidable insurrection\r\nthere, which had shaken to its foundations the ancient empire of\r\nHapsburg, undermined at the same time by intestine troubles and an\r\naggressive war which the kingdom of Piedmont had twice stirred up\r\nagainst it. Little favoring by his principles and interests this united\r\nGermany, \"of which the first thought was a thought of unjust extension,\r\nthe first cry a cry of war,\"[3] he later used all his power in bringing\r\nabout the reestablishment pure and simple, of the German Confederation\r\non the same basis as prior to 1848. The bonds of relationship and of\r\nfriendship which united him to the court of Berlin were never strong\r\nenough to make him abandon for a single instant the cause of the\r\nsovereignty of princes, and of the independence of the States; and in\r\nspite of the sincere affection which he bore \"his brother-in-law, the\r\npoet,\" he neither spared the King of Prussia, Frederick William IV., the\r\nevacuation of the Duchies, nor the hard conditions of Olmuetz. Defender\r\nof European right on the Eider and the Main, of monarchical right on the\r\nTheiss and Danube, peacemaker for Germany, and, so to say, wholesale\r\ndealer in justice for Europe, Nicholas had at this moment a true\r\ngreatness, an immense _prestige_, well merited on the whole, and which\r\nallowed no reflection on the agents charged with representing away from\r\nhome a policy of which no one dared contest the immovable firmness and\r\nthe perfect justice.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Nicholas, in accrediting Prince Gortchakof to the German\r\nConfederation, in an autograph letter dated 11th November, 1850,\r\nrecognized in the reunion of the Diet of Frankfort \"a pledge for the\r\nmaintenance of the general peace,\" and thus characterized by an able and\r\njudicious act, the honorable and salutary mission of this Diet in\r\nordering matters created by the treaties of 1815. However legitimate the\r\ngrievances of the liberal Germans were against the internal policy of\r\nthe _Bund_[4] and its tendencies, little favorable to the development\r\nof the constitutional _regime_, yet one cannot deny that, according to\r\nthe European point of view, and with regard to the equilibrium and the\r\ngeneral peace of the world, this was a marvelous conception, well fitted\r\nto preserve the independence of the States and to hinder any deep\r\nperturbation in the bosom of the Christian family. The chimerical and\r\nmercantile minds of the times, the leading men of Manchester and the\r\nrich publicists, with at least \"one idea a day,\" imagined that this was\r\nthe moment to declare \"war to war,\" to force a universal disarmament, to\r\nabolish military slavery; and to this effect they convoked noisy\r\ncongresses of peace in different parts of the world. They had, indeed,\r\nin a day of _naivete_, convoked one at Frankfort, without suspecting\r\nthat by their side, and in this very _Bundestag_ of such modest\r\nappearance, had sat for a long time a true and permanent congress of\r\npeace,--a congress which would do as much good as possible, and which,\r\nmoreover, would have the advantage of not being ridiculous.\r\n\r\nPlaced in the very centre of Europe, separating by its large and\r\nimmovable body the great military powers which form the border, so to\r\nspeak, of our old continent,--a power neutral by necessity and almost by\r\nlaw over those great plains, where in former times the destinies of\r\nempires were decided,--the German Confederation formed an _ensemble_ of\r\nStates sufficiently coherent and compact to repulse any shock from\r\nabroad, yet not strong enough to become aggressive itself and to menace\r\nthe security of its neighbors. Many years later, and when chancellor of\r\nthe empire, Prince Gortchakof, in a celebrated circular, rendered homage\r\nto this beneficial combination of the _Bund_, \"a combination purely and\r\nexclusively defensive,\" which permitted the localization of a war,\r\nbecome inevitable, \"instead of generalizing it and of giving to the\r\nstruggle a character and proportions beyond all human calculation, and\r\nwhich in any case would pile up ruins and cause torrents of blood to\r\nflow.\"[5]\r\n\r\nIn truth, if in this long half century which intervened between the\r\nCongress of Vienna and the ill-omened battle of Sadowa, the frontiers of\r\nthe States have changed so little in spite of so many and so great\r\nchanges in their political complexion; if the revolution of July, the\r\ncampaign of Belgium, and even the wars of the Crimea and Italy have been\r\ncarried on without noticeably disturbing the balance of the nations, or\r\ninjuring them in their independence, we are specially indebted to this\r\n_Bundestag_ so unappreciated, which by its very existence, by its\r\nposition, and the wheelwork of its completed mechanism, prevented any\r\nconflict from becoming a general conflagration. It is doubtful whether\r\nthe cause of humanity and civilization, or the very cause which the\r\nchancellor of Russia more specially represents with such facility and\r\n_eclat_, have gained in any considerable degree in seeing this old\r\n\"combination\" replaced in our time by another, more simple, it is true,\r\nbut, perhaps, also much less calculated to restore confidence.\r\n\r\nWhile acquitting himself zealously of the duties of his office in\r\nconnection with the Germanic Confederation, Alexander Mikhailovitch\r\ncontinued to occupy the post of minister plenipotentiary at Stuttgart.\r\nHe held it to be a matter of honor to fulfill to the end his\r\nconfidential and intimate mission by the side of the Grand Duchess Olga.\r\nHe divided his time between the free city on the Main, the seat of the\r\n_Bund_, and the little capital on the banks of the Neckar, where a warm\r\nand kind interest always greeted him. At Frankfort he took especial\r\npleasure in the society of his Prussian colleague, a young lieutenant in\r\nthe _Landwehr_,[6] an entire novice in the diplomatic career, although\r\nmarked out for such a prodigious destiny. There had been settled here\r\nfor many years a great Russian celebrity, a poet, who was at the same\r\ntime an influential courtier, and who could not be overlooked by a\r\ndiplomat with a love for intellectual enjoyments, and who had been a\r\nschool-fellow of Pouchkine. The good and mild Vassili Joukofski had\r\ncertainly none of the genius of Pouchkine, nor his independent and\r\nardent character. More properly a facile versifier and an ingenious\r\ntranslator than a creative and original mind, with a nature rather\r\neffeminate and contemplative, the formerly renowned author of \"Ondine\"\r\nhad early made his peace with the official society which the despotic\r\nwill of Nicholas had created, and had always sunned himself in the rays\r\nof imperial favor.\r\n\r\nDuring his long and pleasant career as poet at the court, he had not\r\nbeen without dignities and honors. He, however, had a mission much more\r\nimportant and honorable; he was charged with directing the education of\r\nthe heir-presumptive, Alexander, the present emperor, and of his brother\r\nthe Grand Duke Constantine. Joukofski devoted himself to this task with\r\nintelligence and ardor, and retained the affection of his two august\r\npupils to the end of his life. A proof of this fact is the\r\ncorrespondence which ensued and which he still maintained with them\r\nwhile at Frankfort. These letters were published quite recently. After\r\nhaving finished the education of the grand dukes, he made a voyage of\r\npleasure in Germany. At Duesseldorf he found a companion for life, much\r\nyounger than himself, but sharing all his tastes, even his charming\r\nweaknesses. He finally selected a home on the banks of the Main, at\r\nFrankfort.\r\n\r\nThus, as it happens to more than one of his compatriots, Joukofski,\r\nliving entirely in a foreign country, and being indeed manifestly\r\nunwilling to return to his native land, considered the Occident\r\nmiserably sunken and corrupted, and hoped only in \"holy Russia\" for the\r\nrenovation and safety of a world overrun and possessed by the demon of\r\nrevolution. The events of February only served to confirm him in these\r\ngloomy visions and to plunge him more and more into an uneasy mysticism,\r\nat times even irritating, but more often inoffensive and not devoid of a\r\ncertain unhealthy charm. The campaign of Hungary caused a momentary\r\ndiversion in his sad thoughts, and filled him with joy. It was not so\r\nmuch the glory with which the Russian army covered itself which pleased\r\nhis mind; it was not even the triumph attained by the Russian sword, the\r\nsword of St. Michael, over \"the impure beast:\" his prayers, his hopes\r\nwent far beyond. He hoped--thus he wrote to his imperial pupil that the\r\ngreat czar would profit by the power which God had given him and would\r\n\"solve a problem on which the crusades had stranded;\" that is to say,\r\nthat he should drive the infidel from Byzantium, and liberate the holy\r\nland. Mme. Joukofski, although born a Protestant, felt in unison with\r\nher melancholy husband. Her soul had need of a \"principle of authority,\"\r\nwhich failed her in the reformed confession, and which she sought one\r\nday in the Orthodox Church, to the great joy of the poet, without,\r\nhowever, being able to find there perfect rest.\r\n\r\nSometimes in the _salon_ of the Joukofski the conversations were\r\nstrangely varied and _bizarre_, on literature, politics, the glorious\r\ndestinies of holy Russia, the inanity of modern civilization, the\r\nnecessity of \"a new eruption of Christianity,\" and on many matters\r\ninvisible and \"ineffable.\" Occasionally there fell into the midst of\r\nthis _salon_, like a fantastic apparition, like a ghost from the world\r\nof spirits, a genius original and powerful in a very different way, but\r\nalso tormented and troubled differently from the good court poet and\r\nformer preceptor of the grand dukes. After having unveiled the hideous\r\nsores of Russian society with a vigorous, implacable hand, after having\r\npresented to his nation, in \"Les Ames Mortes\" and in \"L'Inspecteur,\" a\r\npicture whose vices were appalling with truth and life, Nicholas Gogol\r\nsuddenly gave up in despair civilization, progress, and liberty, and\r\nbetaking himself to adore that which he had burned, valued nothing but\r\nbarbarian Muscovy, saw no salvation but in despotism, thought himself in\r\na state of \"unpardonable\" sin, and went in search of divine pity which\r\nalways fled from him. Shortly afterwards he went from St. Petersburg to\r\nRome, then to Jerusalem, then to Paris, everywhere seeking appeasement\r\nfor his lacerated soul. Then he came from time to time to Joukofski, and\r\npassed whole weeks in his house, exhorting his friends to prayer, to\r\nrepentance, and to contemplation of the divine mysteries. There were\r\ndiscussions without end, without a truce, on the \"heathens of the\r\nOccident,\" on \"a crusade,\" which was drawing near, on the redemption of\r\nsinful humanity by a race not yet defiled, and which had kept its faith.\r\nAt several revivals the physicians were forced to interfere to put an\r\nend to a connection not without peril. One day Gogol was found, having\r\ndied of inanition, prostrate before the holy images, in the adoration of\r\nwhich he had lost all thought of himself.... May we be pardoned for this\r\nshort digression. It makes us acquainted with the state of the minds of\r\na certain Russian society towards the end of the reign of Nicholas, and\r\nadds a curious stroke to the picture of the origins of the war in the\r\nOrient. One delights, however, to think of Alexander Mikhailovitch in\r\nthis _salon_ of the Joukofski, on an evening for instance, during such\r\nan intellectual conflict with the poor Gogol. The diplomat, equally\r\ncultivated and skeptical, was certainly made to recognize the bright and\r\nbrilliant flashes which furrowed those driving clouds in a great,\r\ndisordered mind; and he was made to unravel more than one strong and\r\nthrilling thought from the midst of those strange ramblings concerning\r\nan imminent crusade and the near deliverance of Zion.\r\n\r\nWho would have thought it? It was these mystics, these men laboring\r\nunder hallucinations, who had the true presentiment and saw the signs of\r\nthe times! While Joukofski composed his \"Commentary on Holy Russia,\" and\r\nGogol mortified himself before the _icones_, the Emperor Nicholas\r\nrevolved in his mind the great thought of a crusade, and prepared in the\r\nmost profound secrecy the mission of Prince Menchikof. The fact that the\r\nmonarch who had done so much for preserving the peace and equilibrium of\r\nEurope had suddenly decided to throw such a fire-brand of war in the\r\nmidst of the continent scarcely consolidated, while on the other hand\r\nthe autocrat had awaited precisely this epoch of relative calm and of\r\nthe reestablishment of general order to announce his designs, in place\r\nof executing them boldly some years before during the revolutionary\r\ntempest which paralyzed almost all the Powers, his armies being already\r\nin the very heart of Hungary and commanding the banks of the\r\nDanube,--these facts will be for the impartial historian an evident\r\nproof of the good faith with which the czar undertook his fatal\r\ncampaign, of the mystical blindness which guided his spirit at this\r\ntime, and of the profound conviction which he had of the justice of his\r\ncause. Did Prince Gortchakof partake in the same measure of the\r\nillusions of his master? We doubt whether he did. We believe that, like\r\nthe Kisselef, the Meyendorf, the Brunnow, and all the distinguished\r\ndiplomats of Russia, without excepting the chancellor of the empire, the\r\nold Count Nesselrode, he was conscious of the great error toward which a\r\nproud prince, who allowed no objections and understood being \"his own\r\nminister of foreign affairs,\" was tending. That naturally did not\r\nprevent the Russian representative to the German Confederation from\r\nfulfilling his duty with all the zeal which circumstances so critical\r\nmade necessary, and from placing the various resources of his mind at\r\nthe service of his country in the sphere of action which was reserved\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nEvents did not make it of much importance. In the _Bundestag_ were\r\nconcentrated not only all the efforts of the secondary States of the\r\nconfederation, but there also were formed or conceived the projects,\r\nthe preparations, and even the desires of the two principal German\r\npowers, the assistance of which Russia on the one side and France and\r\nEngland on the other, were equally concerned in obtaining. Prince\r\nGortchakof could not complain of the turn affairs took in Germany.\r\nFrederick William IV. was faithful against every temptation. The czar\r\ncould count in any case on \"his brother-in-law, the poet;\" and Alexander\r\nMikhailovitch found an equally firm support in his colleague of Prussia,\r\nthe young officer of the _Landwehr_. The cabinet of Berlin consented\r\nfrom time to time to join in the representations which the allies sent\r\nto St. Petersburg, to sign in concert with them the same note, or one\r\nanalogous or concordant. But it did not take long to see that it only\r\ndid this to retard their movements, and to deter them from any energetic\r\nresolution. At decisive moments it stopped short, hesitated, and\r\npretended to preserve \"_la main libre_\" (_free Hand_). The other members\r\nof the _Bund_ were much more sympathetic and more frankly won over to\r\nthe Russian policy. They did not think the demands of the czar against\r\nTurkey at all exorbitant, and troubled themselves very little about the\r\npreservation of the \"sick man.\" They likewise desired to preserve \"_la\r\nmain libre_,\" closed their ranks in the famous conferences of Bamberg,\r\nand were at times all ready to draw their swords. In truth, Alexander\r\nMikhailovitch showed in the sequel, in the fatal year 1866, very little\r\ngratitude, very little distributive justice, for these poor secondary\r\nStates, so devoted, so serviceable, so immovably attached at the time of\r\nthe Oriental crisis.\r\n\r\nWhile at London and at Paris vehement comments were made in the\r\ncelebrated dispatches of Sir Hamilton Seymour, and the ambitious\r\nprojects of Russia were denounced there, at Hanover, at Dresden, at\r\nMunich, at Stuttgart, at Cassel, nothing but censure was heard against\r\nthe proceedings of the allies and their \"usurpations.\" At Berlin they\r\ngroaned all the more at seeing Christian monarchies undertake so\r\nardently the defense of the Crescent. A single Germanic power, however,\r\nat that time the largest it is true, maintained a different attitude; a\r\nsingle one thought the cause of the allies just, seemed, indeed, at\r\nmoments to be inclined to make common cause with them; and that power\r\nwas Austria,--Austria, but lately succored by the Russian arms; saved by\r\nthe strong and generous hand of the czar on the very brink of the abyss;\r\n\"saved\" by him from sudden dissolution. The astonishment, the\r\nstupefaction, the exasperation of the Emperor Nicholas knew no bounds.\r\nThe entire Russian nation shared his sentiments,--Alexander\r\nMikhailovitch like every patriotic Muscovite. \"The immense ingratitude\r\nof Austria\" became even then the unanimous cry,--the _siboleth_ of every\r\npolitical faith in the vast empire of the North; and so it has remained\r\neven to our days.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to lay stress upon this sentiment born in Russia in\r\nconsequence of the Oriental conflict, and to discuss the real causes for\r\nit; for this sentiment has produced incalculable effects. It has\r\ncontributed largely to the recent catastrophes; it has dictated more\r\nthan one extreme resolution to the cabinet of St. Petersburg; it has\r\nmade it abandon its venerable traditions,--its principles, consecrated\r\nby the experience of generations and seemingly immovable, having become,\r\nin a certain sense, the _arcana imperii_ of the descendants of Peter the\r\nGreat. To sum up, it has governed the general policy of the successor of\r\nNesselrode during the last twenty years.\r\n\r\nAssuredly Russia had the right to count on the recognition of Austria\r\nafter the signal and incontestable service which it had rendered her in\r\n1849. The armies which the czar then sent to the succor of the tottering\r\nempire of Hapsburg contributed powerfully to suppress a fatal, menacing\r\ninsurrection there; and if it is true that in order to obtain this\r\nsuccor it was sufficient to recall to the Czar Nicholas a word given\r\nlong before in a moment of confidential intimacy, the action does not\r\nbecome the less meritorious, and does so much the more honor to the\r\nheart of the autocrat.[7] It would be difficult to deny that this\r\nintervention in Hungary had not a generous and chivalric character which\r\nastonished the contemporaries and the clever. The clever ones, the\r\nstatesmen, who, at this troubled epoch of Europe, had still preserved\r\nenough liberal spirit to cast their eyes toward the Danube,--Lord\r\nPalmerston among others,--remained for a long time incredulous, and\r\nendeavored to divine the reward paid for the aid that was lent. Should\r\nnot the czar retain Galicia as a recompense for his assistance? Would he\r\nnot procure some positive assurance from the side of the Principalities?\r\nwas asked in the offices of Downing Street. Nothing of the sort\r\nhappened, however. The Russians left Austria without a reward, as they\r\nhad entered it without an _arriere-pensee_, and the troops of Paskevitch\r\nevacuated the country of the Carpathians unladen with booty. A young and\r\nardent orator in the Prussian chambers, with the name (as yet but little\r\nknown) de Bismarck,--the same who fifteen years later was to project\r\nstriking a _coup au coeur_ and arming the legions of Klapka,--admired at\r\nthis moment the brilliant action of the czar, and only expressed the\r\npatriotic regret that this magnanimous _role_ had not fallen to his own\r\ncountry, to Prussia. It was for Prussia to bring assistance to its elder\r\nbrother in Germany, to \"its former comrade in arms.\"[8] But it is\r\nallowable to suppose that, even with a king as loyal and poetic as\r\nFrederick William IV., affairs would have been conducted much less\r\nhandsomely than with the barbarian of the North, and that similar aid\r\nfrom Prussia would have cost the empire of Hapsburg a part of Silesia or\r\na part of its influence on the Main.\r\n\r\nShall we say, then, that in intervening in Hungary the Emperor of Russia\r\nacted from pure chivalry and platonic friendship, that he had no thought\r\nof personal interest and the good of his empire? Certainly not; and the\r\nczar had too much loyalty not to avow it frankly. He intervened in\r\nHungary, not only as the friend of the Hapsburg, not only as the\r\ndefender of the cause of order against cosmopolitan revolution; the most\r\npowerful motive in deciding him was the presence in the Hungarian army\r\nof Polish generals and officers, who intended to carry the war into the\r\ncountries subjected to Russian rule. In his manifest of the 8th May,\r\n1849, Nicholas expressed himself as follows: \"The insurrection sustained\r\nby the influence of _our traitors from Poland_, of the year 1831, has\r\ngiven to the Hungarian revolt an extension more and more _menacing_....\r\nHis majesty, the Emperor of Austria, has invited us to assist against\r\n_the common enemy_.... We have ordered our army under way to quell the\r\nrevolt, and to destroy the audacious anarchists, _who equally menace the\r\ntranquillity of our provinces_.\" The language was clear and frank, as\r\nwas fitting for a sovereign preserving the consciousness of his dignity.\r\nThis sovereign intended to render himself a service as well as his ally.\r\nHe was going to stifle in his neighbors' territory an incendiary fire\r\nwhich threatened to harm his own domains; and in the act of intervening,\r\nlet it be well understood, he at the same time acted in\r\nself-preservation.\r\n\r\nWell! it seems according to all justice that the gratitude should\r\ncorrespond to the service rendered, and that the law of preservation,\r\nthe supreme law of nature, should have equal force for the party under\r\nobligations as for the benefactor. There is no policy in the world, were\r\nit even taken from Holy Writ which could advise voluntary servitude;\r\nthere is no doctrine, however sublime one wishes to imagine it, which,\r\namong the duties of the confession, recommends suicide. Now, it was\r\nnothing less than absolute subjection, the ruin of its personality as a\r\ngreat European State, which the Russians demanded of Austria in\r\ndemanding its assent to their pretensions against the Orient. By\r\ngeography, by the spirit of races, by religion, the Russian enterprises\r\nwould strike a mortal blow at the empire of the Hapsburg, if this empire\r\nallowed them to triumph. A Danubian power, Austria should take care that\r\nthe Lower Danube remained neutral, and that it should not fall into the\r\nhands of a powerful neighbor, who would then become master of this great\r\nriver. A Sclavic power in its Oriental provinces, it ought to guard\r\nagainst being placed in immediate contact with an empire pan-Sclavic by\r\ntradition and by fatality, and it could not wish it to be planted in the\r\nPrincipalities, in Bosnia and Herzegovania. A Catholic power, it was\r\nforbidden to recognize the influence and the protectorate which the\r\northodox czar claimed over the Christians of the Grecian rite, of whom\r\nit counted several millions among its subjects. \"My conduct in the\r\nquestion of the Orient! Why it is written on a map?\" said Count Buol, to\r\nhis brother-in-law, M. de Meyendorf, the Russian ambassador. He added\r\nthat it was also written in history. \"I have made no innovation. I have\r\nonly inherited the political legacy of M. de Metternich.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, in a previous crisis, at the time of the Hellenic insurrection\r\nand the war of 1828, the grand chancellor of the court and of the empire\r\nhad defended this principle of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire with\r\na firmness which nothing could disturb. During eight years he had\r\ndefended it, braving the storm alone, not allowing himself to be\r\ndiscouraged either by the unpopularity then attaching to the Turkish\r\ncause or by the desertion of France. Why should the Russians hope that\r\nAustria would now desert this principle so vital for her, that she would\r\ndesert it at the very moment when it commenced to triumph over the\r\nindifference of the Occident, and counted France and England among its\r\nmost earnest champions?\r\n\r\nPlaced between a sentiment of gratitude very lively and real, as we have\r\nsaid, and a great political necessity, the government of Vienna has\r\ncertainly done for gratitude all that it owed. It lavished warnings,\r\nprayers, good offices, offers of mediation on the Emperor Nicholas.\r\nAustria pardoned Russia more than one want of respect, more than one\r\naction of ill humor; it pardoned her the more than airy tone in which it\r\nhad been disposed of in the effusions with Sir Hamilton Seymour,--the\r\nmanner in which a certain autograph letter of the Emperor Francis\r\nJoseph had been received at St. Petersburg,--the haughty, almost\r\ninsulting attitude of Count Orlof during his mission at Vienna. It did\r\nnot cease till the end to calm the irritation of the allies, to modify\r\nand alter their programme, to assert the conciliating disposition of the\r\nczar, to hope against all hope. It pleaded only for the return _in statu\r\nquo_, repudiating any idea of humiliating or weakening Russia; it\r\ndemanded nothing from her but the freedom of the Danube, the\r\nrenunciation of the protectorate, and refused to follow the allies in\r\ntheir demands concerning the Black Sea. Unfortunately, as it happens too\r\noften to him who wishes to be equitable and just towards all parties,\r\nthe Austrian government, by this conduct, ended by alienating France and\r\nEngland and exasperating the Russians. In the summer of 1854, at the\r\nvery moment when Prince Gortchakof exchanged his post at Frankfort for\r\nthat at Vienna, an eminent publicist, who was then, so to speak, the\r\nmouth-piece of the Occident, and of its generous spirits, almost\r\ndespaired of Austria, and cried with bitterness that over there, in the\r\n_Burg_, \"the Russian alliance was something as sacred as a religion, as\r\nfixed as propriety, and as popular as a fashion!\" In the spring of the\r\nfollowing year, the cabinets of Paris and of London resisted, as too\r\nfavorable to Russia, a new plan of arrangement presented by Count Buol,\r\nand the French government on this occasion reproached Austria, in the\r\n\"Moniteur Officiel,\" with offering an expedient rather than a solution.\r\n\r\nThe solution! The Emperor Francis Joseph certainly had it in his hands,\r\nand it perhaps depended only on him to render it as decisive and as\r\nradical as the most mortal enemies of Russia could wish. Why not\r\nconfess it? To see the bitter fruit _gathered_ by Austria in consequence\r\nof its honorable efforts during the Oriental crisis, and to see the\r\nimplacable hatred and the cruel disasters which fell to its lot because\r\nof its attitude then, one surprises one's self sometimes in regretting\r\nthat the cabinet of Vienna had so many scruples at this memorable epoch.\r\nOne almost reproaches it for not having given proof of that independence\r\nof heart which seems, alas! the forced, indispensable condition for the\r\nindependence of states. If Austria had wished to be a little less\r\ngrateful and a little less politic during this war of the Orient, she\r\nwould have resolutely joined herself to France and England, she would\r\nhave taken part in the struggle, and instead of letting the allies rove\r\nfor years around the borders of Russia, in the Black Sea and Baltic, she\r\nwould have opened for them the fields of Poland, and have entered there\r\nwith them. In place of \"tickling the soul of the Colossus or of filing\r\noff a nail,\"--as Russian publicists said later, and not without\r\njustice,--they should then have given him a _coup au coeur_,--one of\r\nthose blows that the great recluse of Varzin knows how to plan and give.\r\nThe cabinet of the Tuileries would not have refused to do this. In his\r\ndispatch of the 26th March, 1855, M. Drouyn de Lhuys laid down very\r\nskillfully the question of Poland; neither would the cabinet of St.\r\nJames have raised serious objections. As to the probable success of such\r\nan enterprise, it suffices to remember that Russia was at the end of its\r\nresources, and that Prussia had not yet re-formed its military\r\norganization, was not yet in possession of its \"instrument,\" and lastly\r\nthat in place of William the Conqueror, Frederick the Romantic occupied\r\nthe throne of the Hohenzollern. The mind is confounded before the\r\ncontemplation of the consequences which such a decision on the part of\r\nthe Emperor Francis Joseph might have caused. The face of the world\r\nwould have been changed; Austria would certainly not have seen Sadowa[9]\r\nin 1866; Europe would not have seen the dismemberment of Denmark, nor\r\nthe destruction of the _Bund_, nor the conquest of Alsace and Lorraine.\r\n\r\nIt was in the summer of 1854, as we have said above, that Prince\r\nGortchakof was sent to Vienna. He replaced there, first provisionally,\r\nand in the following spring, definitely, Baron de Meyendorf, whose\r\nsituation had become unpleasant in consequence of his ties of very near\r\nrelationship with the Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs. Alexander\r\nMikhailovitch at last held that post at Vienna to which he had so long a\r\ntime aspired, the post which, with that of London, was considered, under\r\nthe reign of Nicholas, as the highest in Russian diplomacy, like the\r\n_baton_ of a marshal in his career. But now how full this honor was of\r\nbitterness, and what patriotic pangs accompanied a distinction formerly\r\nardently wished for, to-day accepted through devotion to his sovereign\r\nand his country! On this ground, formerly so pleasant and smiling, the\r\nenvoy of the czar could everywhere see nothing but briers and thorns.\r\nIn this capital, renowned for its boisterous gayety and too frequent\r\nfrivolity, he received nothing but disastrous and distracting news. And\r\nthis \"Austrian ingratitude,\" which he had only had glimpses of and\r\ncombated from afar during his mission at Frankfort, he could now look in\r\nthe face--and smile at it! There is a grief greater than the _ricordare\r\ntempi felici nella miseria_; it is to see a dream of happiness turn into\r\na reality of misery, and one can easily understand what a treasure of\r\ngall this sojourn at Vienna must have heaped up in the wounded heart of\r\nthe Russian patriot.[10]\r\n\r\nIt is superfluous to lay stress upon the activity which the new envoy of\r\nthe czar displayed in this unhappy mission; to mention the infinite\r\nvariety of means which he placed at the service of his cause,\r\nespecially during the conferences of Vienna, which were opened after\r\nthe death of Nicholas and the accession of the Emperor Alexander II.\r\nThat was a moving sight and one which was truly not wanting in grandeur,\r\nthat of the two Gortchakof, one behind the ramparts of Sebastopol, the\r\nother before the council board of Vienna, both defending their country\r\nwith an equal tenacity, only yielding each inch of ground after a\r\ndesperate combat, forced into their last intrenchments, but honored even\r\nto the end by loyal and chivalrous adversaries. To-day an epoch \"of iron\r\nand of blood\" has accustomed us to the summary proceedings--we had\r\nalmost said executions--of Nikolsburg, of Ferrieres, of Versailles, and\r\nof Frankfort, and a martial law used by the diplomats in helmets has\r\nreplaced that which a former Europe, full of prejudices, loved to call\r\nthe right of nations. To-day it is difficult to resist a sentiment of\r\nastonishment, almost of incredulity, in re-reading the protocols of\r\nthese conferences of Vienna, where everything breathes decorum,\r\npoliteness, urbanity, and mutual respect. One thinks himself carried\r\nback to an idyllic age, one far from us, to a world of ancient\r\ngentlemen. M. Drouyn de Lhuys, Minister of Foreign Affairs in France,\r\nLord John Russell, until lately President of the Privy Council of\r\nEngland, did not think it beneath their dignity to go in person to\r\nVienna to discuss there with Prince Gortchakof the possible conditions\r\nof a peace. Russia had lost several great battles, the allied fleets had\r\nblockaded all its seas and even menaced its capital. That did not\r\nprevent the French and English plenipotentiaries from treating it with\r\nall deference, with all the respect which the diplomacy of this good\r\nold time could employ. They displayed a veritable art in the invention\r\nof euphemisms; they gave themselves pains to find the mildest mediums,\r\nthe most acceptable terms for the representative of a vanquished power.\r\nIndeed, that excellent Lord John Russell forced kindness so far as to\r\nrecall, and that in the face of M. Drouyn de Lhuys, that England had\r\nmade Louis XIV. submit to conditions much harder and more\r\nhumiliating.[11] That was, perhaps, the only instance of want of tact\r\nwhich one can find in the conferences of Vienna, and yet what was it but\r\na courteousness from an ally to an ally? As for Austria, it exhausted\r\nitself in finding means to spare the susceptibilities of Russia, and\r\nended by presenting a plan of arrangement which was judged inacceptable\r\nby the cabinets of London and Paris, and drew on it the reproach of the\r\n\"Moniteur Officiel,\" of which we have already spoken.\r\n\r\nNegotiations were broken off, and nothing could be done but to await the\r\nissue of the supreme combat under the walls of Sebastopol. The Russian\r\nplenipotentiary awaited it at his post in Vienna in the twofold anguish\r\nof a patriot and a relation. The bulwark of the Crimea fell, and Russia\r\nfound itself in the most critical situation. It was exhausted,--indeed\r\nmuch more exhausted than Europe then thought,--and the prolongation of\r\nthe war would have infallibly transported the hostilities to the plains\r\nof Poland. At this moment Austria intervened anew. It agreed to the\r\ndemands made by the allies at the conference of Vienna,--even that\r\nclause concerning the neutralization of the Black Sea, which it had\r\nhitherto resisted as too wounding to Russia. It was not possible to\r\nrefuse this satisfaction to the allies after the capture of Sebastopol.\r\nIn reality, these were the easiest conditions which have ever been\r\nimposed on a power at the close of a war so long, so bloody, and of such\r\nincontestable victories. Austria did more; it sent these conditions\r\nunder form of an ultimatum, declaring that it would make common cause\r\nwith the allies if they were not accepted; and Russia accepted them. To\r\nlook at it plainly, this was a service rendered to a young sovereign,\r\nwho, having inherited a disastrous war, thus found the means to spare at\r\nthe same time the memory of his predecessor and the pride of his people.\r\nHe could say now that he had only made peace because of a new adversary,\r\nwho had arisen at the side of the old ones, and whom his father did not\r\ncount on. In fact, it was said in Russia,--it was believed, indeed, so\r\nmuch was it in their interest to believe it. The Russian people were\r\nquickly reconciled with the conquerors of Alma and of Malakof. A single\r\npower remained in their eyes responsible for their disasters,--the power\r\nwhich during the whole war had rested on its arms. Even at this hour\r\nevery Russian heart boils with indignation at the thought of Austria, of\r\nits immense ingratitude and its great treason.\r\n\r\nAlexander Mikhailovitch shared these bitternesses, these popular\r\nrancors, and became the most energetic and openly avowed representative\r\nof them. In this respect he allowed his sentiments to burst forth with a\r\nfrankness which approached very nearly to ostentation. A remark uttered\r\nby him during the session of the Congress at Paris, is still cited at\r\nVienna: \"Austria is not a state, it is only a government.\" These words\r\npreceded him to St. Petersburg and made his fortune there. The popular\r\nvoice designated him as the future avenger, as the man destined to\r\nprepare for his nation a brilliant revenge; and the acute diplomat did\r\nnot trouble himself to controvert such an opinion. Already, however, at\r\nthis Congress of Paris certain tendencies, certain desires were\r\nrevealed, which gave hope, which even opened horizons entirely new. The\r\nname of Italy was pronounced there. Roumania itself found there an\r\nunexpected support. At this strange Congress, which definitely regulated\r\nthe conditions of a peace that France, England, and Austria had imposed\r\non Russia, Austria appeared gloomy and morose, England irritated and\r\nnervous. France and Russia alone exchanged between one another the most\r\nexquisite politeness and surprising cordialities. The sword of Napoleon\r\nIII. became the lance of Achilles, healing where it had just wounded,\r\nwounding where it had healed. \"There was balm of Gilead in it,\" and\r\nsupport in the sovereign of the Tuileries. The day after the Congress,\r\nin the month of April, 1856, the old Count Nesselrode asked to be\r\nretired on account of his age, and Prince Alexander Gortchakof became\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nDuring the four years which he had passed at Frankfort as representative\r\nof his government to the German Confederation, Prince Gortchakof, as we\r\nhave already seen, had made the acquaintance of, and maintained the\r\nmost intimate relations with a colleague, whose rare qualities of mind,\r\nas probably also those of the heart, he appreciated as no one else did.\r\nThe two friends were separated in the summer of 1854, when the Russian\r\nplenipotentiary went to fulfill his painful mission at Vienna. But they\r\ndid not delay in meeting anew, and found as before that perfect\r\ncongeniality of ideas and of sentiments, which, established since their\r\nfirst meeting in Frankfort, has never been interrupted, and has lasted\r\nfor twenty-five years: _grande mortalis aevi spatium_. This friend of\r\nPrince Gortchakof on the smiling banks of the Main, was no other than M.\r\nde Bismarck, the future chancellor of Germany.\r\n\r\nOtto-Edward-Leopold de Bismarck-Schoenhausen, born the 1st of April,\r\n1815, at Schoenhausen, hereditary estate of his family in the old Mark\r\nof Brandenburg, could not flatter himself with having, like his friend\r\nAlexander Mikhailovitch, blood of the Saints in his veins. His\r\nbiographers even observe with visible satisfaction, that at least two of\r\nhis ancestors were excommunicated by the Church and died in final\r\nimpenitence. What is more serious is that the most authorized historians\r\nof the Mark of Brandenburg, M. de Riedel among others, call into\r\nquestion the noble origin of the family. They show that the first of the\r\nline, of whom authentic documents of the fourteenth century speak, Rulo\r\nBismarck, was a member and on several occasions even provost of \"the\r\nguild of master tailors in cloth\" at Stendal, a small market town of the\r\nold Mark. The fact does not seem doubtful. But could not the citizens of\r\nStendal, just as well as those of certain cities in Tuscany, have\r\nforced every country noble, who wished to inhabit the city, to subscribe\r\nhimself in one of those guilds? This is the opinion of the tories in\r\nthis curious genealogical dispute. To hear them, the good citizens of\r\nStendal must have been on a par, in the fourteenth century, with the\r\ngreat citizens of Florence and of Pisa, and Rulo Bismarck must have been\r\nmaster tailor in cloth about as much as Dante, his contemporary, was an\r\napothecary. The whigs, on the contrary, the biographers in\r\nnational-liberal colors, take their part gayly, and one of them\r\ningeniously concludes, that in any case the ancestor Rulo ought \"to\r\ncontemplate with satisfaction and pride from the high heavens the\r\nsplendid imperial mantle which his descendant has made for King William\r\nout of the cloth of Europe.\"\r\n\r\nIn times relatively more modern, the House of Bismarck presents, like\r\nmany a noble country family of Brandenburg, an unbroken succession of\r\nmodest and faithful servants of the state, some soldiers, some employed\r\nin civil duties. The eighteenth century offers us two rather more\r\ncurious specimens, the grandfather and great uncle of the chancellor.\r\nOne was surnamed the _poet_, the other the _adventurer_. The _poet_,\r\nthis painful avowal must be made, composed his verses in the French\r\nlanguage. We have notably by him an \"_Eloge ou Monument erige\r\na la Memoire de Christine de Bismarck, nee de Schoenfeld, par\r\nCharles-Alexandre de Bismarck_,\" Berlin, 1774. It was to his dead wife\r\nthat the retired captain of cavalry thought necessary to elevate this\r\nmausoleum of words and of _Welche_ rhymes, full of the insipid\r\nsentimentality of the time. The _adventurer_ (Ludolf-August) is more\r\ndeserving of his name. He killed his servant in a fit of anger or\r\ndrunkenness, was pardoned, took service in Russia, became involved in\r\npolitical intrigues in Courland, and was forced to go to Siberia in\r\nexile. Pardoned again, he entered into Russian diplomacy, filled several\r\nmissions, and died commanding general at Poltava. Let us say in passing,\r\nthat this Ludolf was not the only one of his family to serve under the\r\nRussian flag, and thus the name of Bismarck has long been well known at\r\nSt. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThe whig biographers lay much stress on the fact, that the mother of the\r\nyoung Otto, \"an intelligent, ambitious, and rather cold woman,\" was a\r\n_bourgeoise_, a Miss Menken, of a family of _savans_ well known at\r\nLeipsic. They love to prove in this manner that the restorer of the\r\nempire was connected by his mother with the _bourgeoisie_, that studious\r\nand cultivated _bourgeoisie_ which is the great strength of\r\nGermany,--while claiming his right to the nobility and the army by his\r\nfather, retired captain of cavalry, and by his grandfather the _poet_.\r\nThose profound Germans have a weakness, it is known, for all symbolism.\r\nThey dignify very often with this name that which is nothing but a _jeu\r\nd'esprit_, in reality a play of words, and it is thus that they attach a\r\ncertain signification to the futile circumstance that the young Otto was\r\nconfirmed[12] at Berlin at the hands of Schleiermacher, the celebrated\r\nDoctor of Divinity, whose learning was much more respectable than his\r\nlife; \"in a manner and for a fleeting moment, it is true, but solemnly,\r\nthe young man called to a life of action _par excellence_, was brought\r\nin contact with our learned theology and our romantic philosophy.\" Nor\r\nhas it been forgotten to exalt the name of the \"gray cloister\" (_Grauer\r\nKloster_), which the lyceum at Berlin bore, where the future destroyer\r\nof convents studied, or to note the French origin of one of his\r\nprincipal professors, Doctor Bonnet, descendant of a Huguenot family\r\nwhich sought refuge in Brandenburg in consequence of the revocation of\r\nthe Edict of Nantes.\r\n\r\nAfter having finished his studies at the lyceum of the gray cloister,\r\nOtto de Bismarck went to the University of Goettingen, to the celebrated\r\n_Georgia Augusta_, in order to study. In reality, he did nothing but\r\nlead the life of the sons of the muse, who have the good or bad fortune\r\nto be at the same time sons of family, _cavalieri_; he cultivated\r\nnothing but hunting, riding, swimming, gymnastic exercises, and fencing.\r\nHe had more than twenty duels, and fully justified the glorious name of\r\n_Bursche_, which clung to him for a long time afterwards, even when he\r\nwas ambassador and minister. One easily understands that the Institutes\r\nand Pandects cannot be very thoroughly studied in the midst of so many\r\ncorporal exercises, and even the attempt to change the noisy _Georgia\r\nAugusta_ for the most quiet and sedate University of Berlin, was a\r\nremedy heroic rather than efficacious. Has M. de Bismarck ever regularly\r\npassed this \"state examination\" (_Staatsexamen_) which in Prussia is the\r\nindispensable condition for an appointment to any public function? A\r\ngrave question, which was discussed for a long time in Germany, and out\r\nof which a weapon has shaped itself for twenty years against the man,\r\nthe deputy, the ambassador, the president of the council. A fact worthy\r\nof notice, and one which well characterizes the formal and regulative\r\nmind of the nation: M. de Bismarck had already defied all Europe, and\r\ndismembered the Danish monarchy, when in the opposition journals of\r\nGermany, there appeared from time to time, like belated rockets,\r\nmalignant allusions to this problematical state examination! Since the\r\nepoch of Sadowa only have these malicious jibes entirely ceased: Sadowa\r\ncaused many other irregularities to pass unnoticed, and assuredly much\r\ngraver ones.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps proper to inquire here what benefits M. de Bismarck reaped\r\nfrom his academic life, and to estimate, if but briefly, the cultivation\r\nand the peculiarities of his mind. It seems certain that M. de Bismarck\r\nis not a man of science and study, and that his liberal education shows\r\nmore than one gap. A pleasing contrast, the two chancellors, Russian and\r\nGerman, of whom one knew but a single lyceum and that one of very\r\ndoubtful merit, while the other attended the most renowned college\r\n(_gymnasium_) and _alma mater_ of learned Germany. Certainly the pupil\r\nof Zarkoe-Zeloe, as regards classical knowledge and true _humaniora_, is\r\nfar in advance of the lucky foster child of _Georgia Augusta_.\r\nNevertheless it is well to observe that M. de Bismarck fills and more\r\nthan fills a certain programme laid down one day by the _spirituel_ and\r\nregretted Saint-Marc Giradin for the well educated men of the world. \"I\r\ndo not require, said he, that they know Latin; I only ask that they have\r\nforgotten it.\" From his academic youth, there has always remained to\r\nthe chancellor of Germany a fund of culture of which he well knows the\r\nuse on occasion, and he understands in a sufficient degree, his Bible,\r\nhis Shakspere, his Goethe, and his Schiller, those four elements of all\r\neducation, even the most common one, in German countries,--precious and\r\nenviable quadrivium of the children of Arminius! Prince Gortchakof has\r\nthe refinements as well as the weaknesses of the man of letters; he\r\ntakes care of his \"_mot_,\" he corrects his phrase, he looks at and\r\nadmires himself in his compositions; it is known that he was one day\r\nsurnamed the _Narcissus of the inkstand_. By his tastes, by his\r\nexquisite sensibility, by his artistic instinct, he has a marked\r\nsuperiority over his former colleague of Frankfort. But the latter\r\nregains all this advantage as soon as one considers the original and\r\npersonal stamp which he knows how to give to his thoughts and to his\r\nspeech, as soon as one seeks the individuality, the breathing creator,\r\nthe _mens agitans molem_, that something mysterious and powerful which\r\nantique sculpture rendered so ingeniously by placing a flame on the\r\nforehead of certain of its statues.\r\n\r\nThe chancellor of Germany is not a lettered man in the strict and\r\nsomewhat vulgar acceptation of the world. He is, to speak correctly,\r\nneither an orator nor a writer. He does not understand developing a\r\ntheme well, graduating its arguments, arranging its transitions. He does\r\nnot construct his period and does not trouble himself about it. He has\r\ndifficulty in expressing himself, both on the tribune and also with the\r\npen. His style is harsh, occasionally very incorrect, as unacademical as\r\npossible. It is intricate, embarrassed, even trivial at moments. Every\r\npart guarded, and all reserve made, there is something of Cromwell in\r\nhis manner of expressing himself. But in an entirely different manner\r\nthan in Cromwell one is forced to admire in him those flashes of\r\nthought, those strong and unforeseen images, those penetrating words\r\nwhich strike, which impress themselves, and which are not forgotten.\r\nWhen quite lately in the midst of an argument, disconnected and\r\nembarrassed, concerning his conflict with Rome, he suddenly cried out:\r\n\"Be sure of one thing, gentlemen, _we will not go to Canossa_!\"[13] one\r\nshould remember that he knew how to comprise there, in a sort of\r\nmenacing _caeterum censeo_,[14] a whole world of memories and of\r\npassions. In a very different spirit, also in a time already far\r\ndistant, it is true, speaking one day--about twenty years have since\r\nflown--of the principles of revolution and contra-revolution, he said\r\nthat a parliamentary debate could never decide between these two\r\nprinciples: \"The decision will only come from God, from the God of\r\nbattles, _when he lets fall from his hand the iron dice of destiny_!\"\r\nOne thinks that he hears De Maistre in this last part of the phrase, and\r\nlike M. de Maistre the chancellor of Germany has had his passage decried\r\nby the _hangsman_; we wish to speak of this invocation to _iron_ and to\r\n_blood_, which must be replaced in its frame and put in its true\r\nlight,--to settle its date,--to appreciate all the relief by the side\r\nof the incontestable brutality. The invocation was made when those\r\nnational-liberals, to-day of such great servility towards him and with\r\nthe _obedience of a corpse_, wished to prevent him from reforming the\r\narmy, at the same time demanding him to complete the unity of Germany.\r\nThe man who felt the distant thunder of Sadowa and Sedan rumble in his\r\nsoul, launched at this moment to the orators the _defi_ which he has\r\nonly too well justified since, saying that it was not by speeches that\r\nGermany could be united: \"to consummate this unity, iron and blood are\r\nnecessary!\" This orator does not breathe at ease in the uniform which\r\nnever leaves him, and he advances only by fits and starts. He collects\r\nlaboriously the clouds of his rhetoric, but the spark ends by flashing\r\nand by illuminating the whole situation. To make himself understood he\r\nemploys the greatest or most familiar images, without choice, just as\r\nthey come; he borrows a quotation from Shakspere and from Goethe just as\r\nwell as from the Wasps of M. Alphonse Karr, or from a couplet of the\r\nvaudeville. One of his most happy, most memorable inspirations, he\r\nsuddenly drew one day from the libretto of the \"Freischuetz.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader will kindly permit us to recall this last episode, even at\r\nthe risk of delaying somewhat in some preliminary explanations of which\r\na German auditory, full of souvenirs of its \"Freischuetz,\" would have no\r\nneed. In this opera of Weber, Max, the good and unfortunate hunter,\r\nborrows a cartridge from Robin, the evil spirit, and immediately kills\r\nan eagle, one of whose feathers he proudly sticks in his cap. He then\r\nasks for some more cartridges, but Robin tells him that they are\r\n\"enchanted balls,\" and that in order to obtain them he must surrender\r\nhimself to the infernal spirits, and deliver his soul to them. Max draws\r\nback, and then Robin, sneering, tells him that he hesitates in vain,\r\nthat the bargain is made, and that he has already committed himself by\r\nthe ball he made use of: \"Do you think, then, that this eagle was a free\r\ngift?\" Well! when in 1849 the young orator of the Mark of Brandenburg\r\nhad to implore the Prussian chamber not to accept for the King of\r\nPrussia the imperial crown which the parliament of Frankfort offered\r\nhim, he ended by crying out: \"It is radicalism which offers this gift to\r\nthe king. Sooner or later this radicalism will stand upright before the\r\nking, will demand of him its recompense, and pointing to the emblem of\r\nthe eagle on that new imperial flag, it will say: _Did you think, then,\r\nthat this eagle was a free gift?_\" A striking image and equally deep and\r\ningenious! Yes, one cannot use with impunity the \"enchanted balls\" of\r\nrevolution, and one does not make a bargain with the popular demon,\r\nwithout leaving it some of his soul. Sooner or later there will stand\r\nupright before you the bad genius whose aid you have accepted, Robin of\r\nthe woods and the streets. He will come to receive your salute, and tell\r\nyou that he did not intend to have worked for the King of Prussia. This\r\nmagnificent oratorical burst of the young deputy of the Mark, the\r\nchancellor of Germany might have considered with benefit in more than\r\none decisive circumstance, for instance on the day when he overthrew the\r\nsecular throne, also the day when he gave the signal for the _combat of\r\ncivilization_.\r\n\r\nThe writer does not differ much from the orator, and, in speaking of the\r\nwriter, we think above all of those intimate and familiar letters which\r\nhave been published in the well known book of George Hesekiel, and which\r\nhave had a merited success in Germany. There is always the same\r\nobscurity, the same embarrassment of elocution, the same disorder, from\r\ntime to time passages of lively and original expressions, of astonishing\r\nfigures, of a bitter, harsh _humor_, which grinds and bites you with\r\ncruel pleasure. These letters are for the great part addressed to his\r\nsister, to \"dear Malvina\" (married to an Arnim), and we will borrow from\r\nthem more than once during the course of this study. One notices in them\r\ncertain descriptions of nature, of the brightness of the moon, of the\r\nNorth Sea, of the view of the Danube from the heights of Buda-Pesth,\r\nwhich are not wanting in coloring effect, and make up a picture. There\r\nis something of Heinrich Heine in these private _Reisebilder_, and it\r\nhas been remarked of them, that there is perhaps something of Hamlet\r\n(and what a Hamlet!) in the following passage, the only melancholy one\r\nwhich we have met with in the midst of so many sanguine and robust\r\nsallies. \"At the mercy of God! Everything is in reality but a question\r\nof time, peoples and individuals, wisdom and folly, peace and war. To\r\nthe living, everything upon earth is but hypocrisy and jugglery, and\r\nthis _mask of flesh having once fallen off_, the wise man and the fool\r\nresemble each other greatly, and it would be hard to distinguish between\r\nthe Prussian and the Austrian, _their skeletons being very carefully\r\nprepared_.\" These lines fell from the same hand, however, which, since\r\nthen, and assuredly by a very specific patriotism, has furnished so many\r\nthousand subjects to the preparers of skeletons!\r\n\r\nOne sees by these letters that M. de Bismarck handled at an early hour\r\nand with predilection this irony, in which he is without a master; a\r\ncold, crafty irony, and which too often approaches sneering. He used it\r\nlater in his speeches, in his conversations with ministers and\r\nambassadors, and even in diplomatic negotiations, in the most important,\r\nmost decisive moments of history. At such moments this irony sometimes\r\naffects a great frankness, sometimes a great politeness, but a frankness\r\nto make you fall on your knees before the first lie, however brazen, a\r\npoliteness to make you implore an incivility without forms as a\r\nveritable charity. One day, on the very eve of the war of 1866, Count\r\nKarolyi, ambassador of Austria, and acting in the name of his\r\ngovernment, summoned M. de Bismarck to declare categorically if he\r\nexpected to break the treaty of peace, the treaty of Gastein.[15] \"No,\"\r\nwas the reply, \"I have not that expectation; _but, if I had, would I\r\nanswer you differently_?\" There is an example of that frankness which\r\ndisconcerts, which confounds, and seems to cry in your ear with that\r\ndevil from the \"Inferno\":\r\n\r\n    \"Tu non pensavi ch'io loico fossi!\"\r\n\r\nAs to the murderous politeness, which sometimes clothes the sarcasm of\r\nM. de Bismarck, let us recall here the _mot_ which he launched later at\r\nthe negotiators of Versailles, coming to treat with him concerning the\r\nsurrender of famished Paris, and to offer him two hundred millions in\r\ncontributions. \"Oh,\" said he, \"_Paris is too great a personage_ that we\r\nshould treat it in such a shabby manner; let us do it the honor of a\r\nmilliard.\" That is truly an original turn which the rival of Heine\r\nthought to give to the _maxima reverentia_ which one owes to misfortune!\r\nWhen one is destined in a ripe age to exercise his _humor_ with such\r\nease at the cost of princes and of peoples, how is it possible when\r\nyoung not to jest pleasantly about that poor fellow of a peasant in\r\nPomerania who drank too much water? In one of his letters to his dear\r\nMalvina, the young country gentleman describes with a hilarious spirit\r\nan inundation which swept over his domain which is divided by a little\r\nbranch of the narrow river Hampel. This inundation severed him from all\r\nhis neighbors, carried off so and so many casks of _eau-de-vie_,\r\n\"introduced an anarchical interregnum from Schievelbein to Damm,\" and he\r\nends by this stroke: \"_I am proud to be able to say_, that in my little\r\nbranch of the Hampel a wagoner was drowned with his horse and his whole\r\nload of tar!\" How proud in a different degree was this gentleman one day\r\nwhen, Europe having become his domain, he saw disappearing in the midst\r\nof the billows, billows of blood this time, a whole army and its chief,\r\na whole empire and its emperor,--_currus Galliae et auriga ejus!_ That\r\ndid not prevent, at another time, the young country gentleman from\r\njumping bravely into the water to rescue his groom and gaining the medal\r\nfor saving life. During many years this medal was the only one to\r\ndecorate the broad chest of the Prussian minister at Frankfort. Asked\r\none day by a colleague to the _Bund_ about a decoration to which the\r\ndiplomatic corps is but little accustomed, he replied in the tone which\r\nhe alone possesses, that he sometimes happened to rescue a man,--in his\r\nleisure moments, be it understood. Probably, if he had been further\r\npressed, he was capable of adding that he only did it for exercise.\r\n\r\nThus, to resume, from the epoch of his apprenticeship at the gray\r\ncloister and _Georgia Augusta_, Otto de Bismarck carried a literary\r\nburden, which, without being either too heavy or too full, has\r\nnevertheless enabled him to make his tour of the political world with\r\nease and honor. And also since this epoch his mind disclosed the\r\nprecious qualities which still distinguish it; a vivid and powerful\r\nimagination, a rare happiness in his choice of expressions occasionally\r\ngrandiose, occasionally vulgar, but always striking; and lastly, a\r\n_humor_ which has no equal, and which, to speak with Jean Paul, is a\r\ntrue _sirocco_ to the soul. With all this no grace, no charm, no\r\ndistinction or delicacy,--not a generous accent, no sweet and\r\nsympathetic cord, a complete absence of that milk of human kindness of\r\nwhich the poet speaks, an absolute want of that charity which, according\r\nto the great Christian moralist, is like the heavenly perfume of the\r\nsoul. As to the art or rather handicraft, as to the work which consists\r\nin arranging his phrases, in connecting and disposing them so as to\r\nintroduce harmony and clearness in the different parts of speech, in\r\neffacing its asperities and inequalities, in one word as to the _style_,\r\nM. de Bismarck never learned it or always disdained it. If we dared to\r\napply to this style one of those trivial but expressive images of which\r\nhe himself offers us more than one example, we would willingly compare\r\nit to a certain strange drink, hardly credible, and which, according to\r\nhis biographers, the German chancellor has always liked: it consists of\r\na mixture of champagne and _porter_! The language is in imitation of the\r\ndrink: one finds in it the _piquant_, the sparkling, the exhilarating of\r\nthe _Ay_ together with the heaviness, the blackness, and above all the\r\nbitterness of the _stout_.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, that the man who one day was to impose on all the\r\nStates of Germany the severe bureaucratic and military laws of Prussia,\r\n\"to place Germany in the saddle,\" to use one of his _mots_, to press it\r\ninto the straight jacket of obligatory service,--even to indirectly\r\ntrain all Europe to new exercises, and to make it leave the plow for the\r\nsword, liberal occupations for the autumn and summer manoeuvres,--this\r\nman, for his part, has never been able to bind himself down to academic\r\nduties, neither to the regular work of the bureau, nor to the severe\r\ndiscipline of the soldier. He himself has acknowledged having heard but\r\n_two_ hours of lecture during his whole stay at _Georgia Augusta_. The\r\nuniversity course being ended, he tried several times the administrative\r\nor judiciary career; he tried it at Aix-la-Chapelle, at Potsdam, at\r\nGreifswalde, then again at Potsdam, and had to give it up every time,\r\ndisgusted by the monotonous labor of the bureau, or by quarrels with his\r\nsuperiors. On this subject is told the _piquant_ reply of the young\r\n_referendarius_ to a principal who had made him wait an hour in an\r\nantechamber: \"I came to request a short leave of absence; but during\r\nthis long hour I have had time to reflect, and I demand my dismission.\"\r\nThrice he made a trial of the military service, without arriving at a\r\nhigher grade than that of lieutenant in the _Landwehr_, a rank which he\r\nappreciated, however, and of which he loved to don the uniform on solemn\r\noccasions, even at the very time when he was already minister at\r\nFrankfort. The reader knows that the day of Sadowa brought him the\r\ninsignia of a general. Those ten or twelve years which had passed for M.\r\nde Bismarck since his disputed state examination to his entrance into\r\nthe Prussian chamber, the German biographers call by the fine name\r\n\"years of storm and trouble,\" which recalls one of the most brilliant\r\nepochs of their literature.[16] In truth they were stormy, filled with\r\nmiscarriages of more than one kind, with travels, financial\r\nembarrassments, perhaps also with an unrequited love. At least that is\r\nthe meaning one is inclined to give to the following passage from a\r\nletter addressed to his sister Malvina: \"I struggle in vain, I shall end\r\nby marrying ----; the world wishes it thus, and nothing seems more\r\nnatural, and then we will both be killed on the spot. She left me\r\ncoldly, it is true, but they all do that. It would not be so bad,\r\nhowever, if one could throw off his feelings with his shirts, no matter\r\nhow rarely one changes the latter.\"\r\n\r\nHe seems to have had a very sincere affection for this sister; he\r\noverwhelms her with the most tender names. Thus he calls her his little\r\ndear, his Malvina, his _Maldewinchen_, his good little Arnim; he even\r\ncalls her once (pardon him, O divinities of Walhalla) simply _and in\r\nFrench_, \"_ma soeur_.\" In all the letters of this epoch, dated for the\r\nmost part from the estates of Kniephof or Schoenhausen (it was not until\r\nlater that M. de Bismarck acquired the famous Varzin[17]), by the side\r\nof an always biting and harsh _humor_, one can perceive a certain\r\ndisenchantment; by the side of the cares of fortune appear from time to\r\ntime projects for the future, very modest, truly, and which seldom aim\r\nat politics. In 1846 he attached a certain importance at being made\r\nsurveyor of dikes in the district (_Deichhauptmann_). \"The position is\r\nnot remunerative, but it offers some interest in regard to Schoenhausen\r\nand other estates, for we would depend on it in a great measure if we\r\nwere again without water as in the past year.... Bernard (a friend)\r\ninsists on my going to Prussia (to Berlin). I would like to know what he\r\nexpects there. He affirms that by my disposition and my inclinations, I\r\nam made for the service of the state, and that sooner or later I will\r\nend by entering it.\" Suddenly, and on the very eve of the reunion of the\r\nfirst Prussian parliament, one is surprised by the plan of a voyage to\r\nthe Indias,--probably to make his fortune and establish himself\r\nthere,--and one thinks involuntarily of Cromwell wishing to embark for\r\nAmerica on the eve of the long parliament. Do not think, however, that\r\nthe days passed sadly and morosely at Kniephof and at Schoenhausen: one\r\nlives there, one overlives the life of _Juncker_ (country squire) and\r\nthe officers of the neighboring garrison are good and stout fellows, in\r\nwhose company one hunts and dances, \"one empties great bowls half filled\r\nwith champagne, half with porter;\" the guests are awakened in the\r\nmorning by pistols fired off close to their pillows; on entering the\r\n_salon_ the female cousins are frightened with four foxes, and honor is\r\npaid to the name given by the whole country to the proprietor of the\r\ndomain, the name of \"mad Bismarck\" (_der tolle Bismarck_). They are\r\nmadcaps, and blusterers, prompt to draw their swords, to fight with\r\npistol or steel, and they do not even avoid a pugilistic scene. One day\r\nin a smoking room at Berlin, the former pupil of _Georgia Augusta_ broke\r\nhis beer mug on the skull of a stranger disrespectful in his language\r\ntowards a member of the royal family; not, however, without having first\r\naddressed a charitable warning to the insolent speaker, nor without\r\nhaving afterwards, very sedately, very politely, asked of the waiter the\r\ncost of the damage.[18] This happened in 1850; M. de Bismarck had\r\nalready been deputy several years, and was on the point of becoming\r\nminister plenipotentiary to the Germanic Confederation.\r\n\r\n_Der tolle Bismarck_; it was not only at Kniephof and at Schoenhausen\r\nthat the future chancellor of Germany was thus called. The Berlinese\r\nthemselves had no other name for him for a long time, during all the\r\nparliamentary period of the young deputy of the Mark, since his maiden\r\nspeech and his first appearance on the tribune,--when having provoked\r\nan indescribable tumult by a violent attack against the liberals he\r\ndrew from his pocket a newspaper, and quietly commenced reading, while\r\nwaiting for the storm to calm,--up to his last speech on December 3,\r\n1850, which completed the exasperation of the chamber, but was worth a\r\ndiplomatic post to the orator. Success advances a little like the\r\naristocratic law of the Chinese: it is necessary to supply glory from\r\nthe rear and to throw lustre on the obscure antecedents of the favorite\r\nof fortune. This was, however, more to mistake the time and to misplace\r\nthe historical perspective, than to wish to assign to M. de Bismarck in\r\nthose years (1847-50) any important _role_ which he did not fill until\r\nfifteen years later. The truth is that this _role_ was not in this first\r\nperiod either of such eminence, or, above all, sufficiently respected to\r\nbe tempted to arrange itself in an abstract, inductive method. An active\r\nand restless member of the group of _Juncker_ in 1847, and of the great\r\n_party of the cross_ which was formed after the revolution of February,\r\nthe country gentleman of Schoenhausen was far from having in the bosom\r\nof this party the authority of a Gerlach and a Stahl, or the great\r\nposition of a similar feudal lord of Silesia or Pomerania. In spite of\r\nhis audacity, his impetuosity, and his _sang-froid_; in spite of his\r\nexceedingly happy sallies with an eloquence unequal and embarrassed in a\r\nvery different manner from to-day, M. de Bismarck was at this epoch\r\nnothing but the Hotspur, and the _enfant terrible_ of the sacred phalanx\r\nwhich defended the throne, the altar, and the conservative principles.\r\nHe was in a measure the General Temple of the ill-tempered\r\nlight-horsemen, a General Temple joined with the Marquis of Pire. At\r\nany rate he only passed for a successful Thadden-Triglaff, that brave M.\r\nThadden-Triglaff who declared that he desired the liberty of the press,\r\non condition, however, \"that there was a power by the side of each\r\njournal to hang up the pamphleteers.\" The speeches of M. de Bismarck,\r\nfriend and neighbor of this ingenious legislator of the press, were\r\noften not more reasonable. Did he not say one day, word for word, \"that\r\nall the great cities ought to be destroyed and razed to the ground, as\r\nthe eternal homes of revolution?\"\r\n\r\nThe Athenians of the Spree[19] laughed at these jests, repeated those\r\nwords full of _humor_, and above all admired a certain argument _ad\r\nhominem_ by means of a mug of beer. Occasionally also they criticised\r\nwith malice the advances made to the innocent, to the democrats, and\r\ndiverted themselves especially over the famous little branch of olive\r\nwhich the country squire of Schoenhausen showed one day to his colleague\r\nof the chamber, the very radical Doctor d'Ester. This branch, he told\r\nhim, he had cut in a recent excursion to Vaucluse, from the tomb of\r\nLaura and Petrarch. He put it carefully in his cigar case and thought of\r\npresenting it one day to the red gentlemen \"as a sign of\r\nreconciliation.\" It was in the strange destiny of this extraordinary man\r\nnot to be thought in earnest until the day when he became terrible. _Der\r\ntolle Bismarck_, the Germans said in 1850; at Frankfort the good Count\r\nRechberg called him scoffingly a _Bursche_, and he was considered a\r\npersonage worthy of laughter in the eyes of the French minister, a man\r\nof mind, however, even in 1864. The year after the legendary coast of\r\nBiarritz, he pursued with his projects the Emperor Napoleon III., who,\r\nresting on the arm of the author of \"Colomba,\" whispered from time to\r\ntime into the ear of the academician senator those words: \"He is crazy!\"\r\nFive years later the dreamer of Ham gave up his sword to the crazy man\r\nof the Mark.\r\n\r\n\"I belong,\"--such was the defiant declaration of M. de Bismarck in one\r\nof his first speeches in the chamber,--\"I belong to an opinion which\r\nglories in the reproaches of obscurantism, and of tendencies of the\r\nMiddle Age; I belong to that great multitude which is compared with\r\ndisdain to the most intelligent party of the nation.\" He wanted a\r\n_Christian State_. \"Without a religious basis,\" said he, \"a state is\r\nnothing but a fortuitous aggregation of interests, a sort of bastion in\r\na war of all against all; without this religious basis, all legislation,\r\ninstead of regenerating itself at the living sources of eternal truth,\r\nis only tossed about by human ideas as vague as changeable.\" It is for\r\nthis reason that he pronounced against the emancipation of the Jews, and\r\nrepulsed, above all, with horror the institution of civil marriage, a\r\ndegrading institution, and one which \"made the church the train-bearer\r\n(_Schleppentraeger_) of a subaltern bureaucracy.\"[20] He was as\r\n_intransigeant_ for the throne as for the altar: he set at defiance the\r\nprinciple of the sovereignty of the people; universal suffrage (which he\r\nhimself was to introduce one day into the whole German empire!) seemed\r\nto him a social danger and an outrage to good sense. He denied the\r\nrights of the nation; the crown alone had rights: the old Prussian\r\nspirit knew but that,--\"and this old Prussian spirit is a Bucephalus who\r\nwillingly allows his legitimate master to mount him, but who will throw\r\nto the ground every Sunday rider (_Sonntagsreiter_)!\"\r\n\r\nA resolute adversary of modern ideas, of constitutional theories, and of\r\nall that then formed the programme of the liberal party in Prussia, the\r\ndeputy of the Mark combated with the same energy the two great national\r\npassions of this party: the \"deliverance\" of Schleswig-Holstein and the\r\nunity of Germany. He deplored that \"the royal Prussian troops had gone\r\nto defend the revolution in Schleswig against the legitimate sovereign\r\nof that country, the King of Denmark;\" he asserted that they were making\r\na groundless quarrel with this king, that they sought a quarrel with him\r\n\"for no cause\" (_um des Kaisers Bart_), and he did not hesitate to\r\ndeclare before an angry chamber, that the war provoked in the Duchies of\r\nthe Elbe was \"an undertaking eminently iniquitous, frivolous,\r\ndisastrous, and revolutionary.\"[21] As to the unity of Germany, the\r\nyoung orator of the ultras repulsed it in the name of Right, of the\r\nsovereignty and of the independence of princes, as well as in the name\r\nof patriotism, be it understood. He was Prussian, a _specific_ Prussian,\r\na hardened Prussian (_stockpreusse_), and cared very little to unite\r\nthe good and firm substance \"with the dissolved elements (_das\r\nzerfahrene Wesen_) of the South.\" He called on the army: Does this army\r\nwish to exchange the old national colors, black and white, for this\r\nGerman tricolor, which was only known to it as the emblem of revolution?\r\nDoes it wish to exchange its old Dessauer march for the song of a\r\nProfessor Arndt on the _German fatherland_?\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of his speech against the imperial crown offered\r\nby the parliament of Frankfort, of the ingenious allusion borrowed from\r\nthe libretto of the \"Freischuetz.\" While refusing the imperial crown,\r\nFrederick William IV. did not the less endeavor, during the years 1849\r\nand 1850, to rescue some waifs from this wreck of unitarian ideas; he\r\ntried to group around himself, and with the aid of the liberals, a\r\nnotable part of the Germanic body, to create a sort of northern\r\nconfederation: \"restricted union\" became for a moment the _mot d'ordre_\r\nof a programme which General Radowitz was charged to place on the stage\r\nof the parliament of Erfurt. M. de Bismarck condemned without pity or\r\nweakness all these vain attempts; with the great theorician of his\r\nparty, the celebrated Professor Stahl, he pleaded for the return to the\r\n_statu quo_ prior to 1848. Like him he demanded \"that the overturned\r\ncolumn of right be replaced in Germany,\" that the _Bund_ be restored on\r\nlegal bases, according to the terms of the treaty of Vienna, and that no\r\ncessation should be made in placing Prussian politics on its guard\r\nagainst any \"course of Phaeton\" in a region of clouds and thunder.\r\n\r\nThe thunderbolt did not in truth delay in striking, and the \"course of\r\nPhaeton\" was brusquely arrested by the hand of that great Austrian\r\nminister, who himself only traversed, like a luminous meteor, the most\r\nelevated regions of power to disappear suddenly and to leave behind him\r\neternal regrets. Prince Felix de Schwarzenberg recalls in some respects\r\nthose statesmen of whom England lately offered the astounding example,\r\nthose Peterboroughs, those Bentincks, and those like them, who knew how\r\nto interrupt, almost suddenly, a life given up to pleasures and to the\r\nfrivolous follies of the world, to reveal themselves in a trice like\r\nveritable political geniuses, and to die before their time, after having\r\nexhausted the intoxication of easy good fortune and of glory, arduous in\r\na very different degree. It is known with what a firm and steady hand\r\nthe prince seized the helm of affairs in Austria, and in how short a\r\ntime he succeeded in lifting up a monarchy placed on the brink of an\r\nabyss. Was his conduct in every particular irreproachable; was it even\r\nprovident to the end? That is not the question for us. Let us limit\r\nourselves in saying that rarely has a minister met with more good luck\r\nin his short career, found so much assurance in success, and spoken in a\r\nloftier or prouder tone in vexatious necessities. This time Prince\r\nSchwarzenberg spoke with all the authority which right gave him. Perhaps\r\nhe spoke even too harshly, and Prussia seemed for a moment ready to pick\r\nup the glove. Frederick William IV. demanded of the chambers a credit of\r\nfourteen million thalers for the armament, and made a warlike speech.\r\nEurope became attentive, the national assembly of France was on the\r\npoint of ordering a new levy of troops, and, fatidical prelude of a\r\ntragedy which was not to be played till fifteen years later, in 1850 as\r\nin 1866, Louis Napoleon thought that he ought to encourage the cabinet\r\nof Berlin, encourage it with aid, and in direct opposition to the\r\ngeneral sentiment of the country! While the national assembly in France\r\npronounced itself very plainly for neutrality and the minister of\r\nforeign affairs was even inclined in favor of Austria, the president of\r\nthe republic sent an intimate friend to Berlin, M. de Persigny, with the\r\nmission to engage the King of Prussia as much as possible in the war.\r\nWar appeared inevitable. The troops were already disposed in two parts;\r\nthere had already been encounters between the advanced guards. All of a\r\nsudden, and before a menacing ultimatum from Vienna, strengthened by a\r\nfriendly notice from St. Petersburg, M. de Manteuffel, president of the\r\nPrussian council, proposed to that of Austria to hold an interview at\r\nOderberg, on the frontier of the two States. Some hours after having\r\nsent this proposition, he announced by telegraph (a proceeding then very\r\nrare), that, on positive orders from the king, he should go as far as\r\nOlmuetz, without waiting for the reply. He went there, and signed (29\r\nNovember, 1850) the preliminaries of peace, the famous \"punctuations\" by\r\nwhich Prussia yielded to the demands of Austria on every point.\r\n\r\nIt is not astonishing that such a profound humiliation,--preceded by a\r\nmeasure of distress up to that time unheard of in the annals of\r\ndiplomacy, and immediately followed by an Austrian dispatch which very\r\nuselessly did nothing but irritate the wound,[22]--filled liberal\r\nPrussia with grief and indignation. It was in vain that M. de Manteuffel\r\nendeavored to justify his conduct before the national mind. He affirmed\r\nthat he would rather be placed \"in front of conical balls than pointed\r\nspeeches\" (_lieber Spitzkugeln als spitze Reden_); the chamber of Berlin\r\nexpressed with passion the griefs of the country, and M. de Vincke\r\nclosed one of the most vehement philippics with these words: \"Down with\r\nthe ministry!\" A single orator dared to undertake the defense of the\r\nministry, and to make in the same moment the apotheosis of Austria.\r\nAlready in the preceding year M. de Bismarck had desired for his country\r\nthe _role_ of the Emperor Nicholas in Hungary. Since then he had never\r\nneglected an occasion to resent in behalf of the empire of the Hapsburg\r\nthe insults which German liberalism had heaped on him, and he remained\r\ntrue to this policy even in the most extraordinary circumstances, and in\r\nthe midst of the indescribable clamors of the assembly. He maintained\r\nthat there could be no possible or legitimate federation in Germany\r\nwithout Austria. One of the greatest griefs of the Teutons against\r\nAustria has been in all times its not forming a state purely German, its\r\ncontaining in its bosom different populations and of an \"inferior\" race.\r\nThis was the principal argument of the parliament of Frankfort in favor\r\nof the constitution of a Germany without the empire of the Hapsburg, and\r\nM. de Bismarck did not fail to reproduce it in 1866, in a memorable\r\ncircular. In 1850 the deputy of the Mark did not share this opinion; he\r\nwas convinced that \"Austria was a German power in the full force of the\r\nterm, although it also had the good fortune to exercise its dominion\r\nover foreign nationalities,\" and he boldly concluded that \"_Prussia\r\nshould subordinate itself to Austria_ to the end that they might combat\r\nin concert the menacing democracy.\" Truly, in recalling that session of\r\nthe Prussian chamber on the 3d December, 1850, one can, in the words of\r\nMontesquieu, observe the spectacle of the astounding vicissitudes of\r\nhistory; but the irony of fate commences to take its truly fantastic\r\nproportions, when one remembers that it was precisely this speech of the\r\n3d December, 1850, which decided the vocation of M. de Bismarck and\r\nopened to him the career of foreign affairs. Forced to consent to the\r\nrestoration of the _Bund_, and resigned to the preponderance of the\r\nempire of the Hapsburg, the Prussian government thought in truth that it\r\ncould give no better pledges of its disposition than in choosing for its\r\nplenipotentiary to the Germanic Confederation the ardent orator whose\r\ndevotion to the cause of the Hapsburg was even able to resist the proof\r\nof the humiliation of Olmuetz. And it was as the most decided partisan of\r\nAustria that the future conqueror of Sadowa made his entrance into the\r\narena of diplomacy!\r\n\r\nThe chamber was prorogued in consequence of this stormy discussion. The\r\nrupture with the national party was consummated, and M. de Manteuffel,\r\nwhose cold and bureaucratic mind sympathized in reality but very\r\nslightly with the ultras, thought it nevertheless useful to strengthen\r\nthe government by making them some advances. Several prominent posts in\r\nthe civil service were conferred on members of the extreme right: M. de\r\nKleist-Retzow, among others, held the presidency of the Rhenish\r\nprovinces. One could hardly dream of utilizing in the same manner the\r\ntalents of the former _referendarius_ of Potsdam and Greifswalde, who\r\nhad shown so little disposition and taste for the administrative career:\r\non account of the considerations already mentioned, it was first thought\r\nof sending him to Frankfort as first secretary of the legation, but with\r\nthe assurance of being made real representative at the end of some time.\r\nThis choice produced some surprise. It was an entirely new proceeding\r\n(they have become accustomed to it there and in other places since) to\r\nreward a deputy with a diplomatic mission for his attitude or his vote\r\nin the chamber. It was asked if the eccentric and impetuous cavalier of\r\nthe Mark would be the right man in the right place in the midst of such\r\ndelicate circumstances. The timid and overscrupulous M. de Manteuffel\r\nwas not without apprehension on this head, and the very ardor with which\r\nM. de Bismarck accepted the position only augmented the uneasiness of\r\nthe president of the council. King Frederick William IV., who personally\r\nhad a very high regard for the ardent \"Percy\" of the _party of the\r\ncross_, had nevertheless some doubts. \"Your majesty can try me,\" said\r\nthe aspirant for diplomacy; \"if matters go wrong, your majesty will be\r\nat perfect liberty to recall me at the end of six months or even\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\nIt was only, however, at the end of eight years that he was recalled by\r\nthe successor of Frederick William IV. And still, after the first days\r\nof his mission (June, 1851) he expressed himself thus in a confidential\r\nletter concerning the men and the affairs he was charged to deal with:\r\n\"Our relations here consist in distrust and mutual _espionage_. If we\r\nonly had something to spy out or to hide! But these are merely silly\r\ntrifles, for which these people torment their minds. These diplomats who\r\nretail with an air of importance their _bric-a-brac_, seem to me much\r\nmore ridiculous than a deputy of the second chamber draping himself in\r\nthe feeling of his dignity. If exterior events do not unexpectedly\r\narise, I know from to-day exactly what we shall have done in two, three,\r\nor five years, and what we can dispatch in twenty-four hours, if we wish\r\nto be sincere and reasonable for one day. I never doubted that all these\r\ngentlemen did their cooking in water; but a soup so watery and insipid\r\nthat it is impossible to find in it a trace of fat does not cease to\r\nastonish me.... I have made very rapid progress in the art of saying\r\nnothing with many words; I write several sheets of reports, plain and\r\nround, like the leading articles, and if, after having read them,\r\nManteuffel understands a jot, he is cleverer than I am. No one, not even\r\nthe most malicious of democrats can have any idea what nonsense and\r\ncharlatanisms diplomacy hides.\"\r\n\r\nSome years later, during the complications of the Orient, he wrote to\r\nhis sister Malvina: \"I am at a session of the _Bund_; a very highly\r\nhonored colleague is reading a very stupid speech on the anarchical\r\nsituation in Upper Lippe, and I think that I cannot better improve this\r\nopportunity than in pouring out before you my fraternal sentiments.\r\nThese knights of the _round table_ who surround me in this ground floor\r\nof the Taxis palace are very honorable men, but not at all amusing. The\r\ntable, twenty feet in diameter, is covered with a green cloth. Think of\r\nX---- and of Z---- in Berlin; they are entirely of the calibre of these\r\ngentlemen of the _Bundestag_. I have the habit of approaching all things\r\nwith a feeling of innocence which gapes. My disposition of mind is that\r\nof a careless lassitude after I have succeeded in bringing little by\r\nlittle the _Bund_ to the desolating consciousness of its profound\r\nnothingness. Do you remember the _Lied_ of Heine: _O Bund, o chien tu\r\nn'es pas sain_, etc.? Well! that _Lied_ will soon, and by a unanimous\r\nvote, be raised to the rank of national hymn of Germany.\"\r\n\r\nThe lassitude, the disgust as well as the contempt for the _Bund_\r\nincreased from year to year. In 1858 he thought of leaving the career\r\nforever. He had enough of \"this _regime_ of truffles, of dispatches and\r\nof grand crosses.\" He spoke of withdrawing \"under the guns of\r\nSchoenhausen,\" or still better of \"growing young by ten years, and once\r\nmore taking the offensive position of 1848 and 1849.\" He wished to\r\nfight, without being hindered by relations and official courtesies, to\r\nthrow off the uniform, and to \"go into politics in swimming drawers (_in\r\npolitischen Schwimmhosen_).\"\r\n\r\nWhat is there astonishing in it? Of all imaginable political men, M. de\r\nBismarck was certainly the least fitted to have a regard and liking for\r\na deliberative body essentially moderated and moderating, where\r\neverything was discussed in private, in elaborated speeches, thought\r\nover at length and still more freely discussed, and where the gashes and\r\nthrusts actually amounted to nothing. A great congress of peace could\r\nscarcely have any attraction for the ardent Percys whom the smallest\r\nconference of Bangor[23] caused, enraged, to jump out of their skins;\r\nand the _Bundestag_, as we have said, was a permanent congress of peace\r\ncalled to maintain the _statu quo_ and to remove every cause for\r\nconflict. The little incidents, the little manoeuvres and the little\r\nstruggles for influence were not wanting, it is true, in this company,\r\nmore than in any other; they served to maintain the good humor of the\r\nordinary diplomats, and were generally considered as useful stimulants\r\nfor the good management of affairs and good digestion of dinners. But\r\nthey must have seemed paltry in the eyes of a man of action and of\r\ncombat; they must have irritated, at times even exasperated him! To\r\nobserve the affairs of the world from this post on the Main, which\r\nallowed them to be grasped in their _ensemble_; to profit by abundant\r\ninformation, to compose therefrom brilliant dispatches, fit to instruct\r\nand above all to amuse an august master; to utter occasionally a very\r\n_spirituel_, very malicious _mot_, and to rejoice at it; to make others\r\nenjoy it, even to carry it perfectly warm to Stuttgart, and to confide\r\nits further expedition to a gracious Grand Duchess,--that was an\r\noccupation which might content Prince Gortchakof, even charm the leisure\r\nhours of a man educated in the school of Count Nesselrode and grown old\r\nin the career. But how was it possible to make such an existence\r\nagreeable to a cavalier of the Mark, improvised into a minister\r\nplenipotentiary, or to shut up in such a narrow circle, though a\r\npleasant one, a \"_fiance_ of Bellona,\" still foaming from battles\r\ndelivered without cessation for four years on a resounding stage! In\r\norder to find a fitting compensation in the new circle in which he was\r\nplaced, he needed at least some great European combination, some great\r\nnegotiation capable of exercising his faculties, and of making them\r\nknown,--and they talked to him of _bric-a-brac_, of Upper Lippe! A\r\nnegotiation as insignificant as that with the poor Augustenburg, brought\r\nto a happy end in 1852, could certainly not be counted among the\r\ntriumphs worthy of a Bismarck,[24] and this was nevertheless the single\r\nand pitiful \"bubble of fat\" which he was able to discover in the soup\r\ncooked during several years at Frankfort!\r\n\r\nIt is true that the question of the Orient did not delay in breaking\r\nout, and that at first it even seemed to open vast perspectives. Prussia\r\nwas well disposed towards Russia. The secondary States of Germany showed\r\nthemselves still more ardent, and sometimes even went so far as to have\r\nthe appearance of being willing to draw their swords; so much the worse\r\nfor Austria if she persisted in making common cause with the allies;\r\nthat might bring about important territorial modifications, and all to\r\nthe advantage of the House of Hohenzollern! And the representative of\r\nPrussia to the Germanic Confederation (\"his excellency the lieutenant,\"\r\nas he was then called on account of the Landwehr uniform which he liked\r\nto wear) gave a warm and firm support in this crisis to his colleague of\r\nRussia, who had become his most intimate friend. He was not, however,\r\nlong in seeing that the Germanic Confederation would not desert its\r\nneutrality; that the secondary States, in spite of all the agitations in\r\nthe conferences of Bamberg, would not take an active part either in one\r\nsense or in the other, and that the war would be localized in the Black\r\nSea and the Baltic. He conceived a profound disdain for the _Bund_, was\r\n\"conscious of its unfathomable nothingness,\" and hummed over the green\r\ncloth of the Taxis palace the _Lied_ of Heine on the Diet of Frankfort.\r\nIn addition, he experienced on this occasion a grief, which he never\r\nforgot, which he recalled many years afterwards in a confidential\r\ndispatch which has become celebrated. During the Oriental complications,\r\nhe wrote in 1859 to M. de Schleinitz, \"Austria overcame us at Frankfort\r\nin spite of all the commonalty of ideas and desires which we then had\r\nwith the secondary States. These States, after each oscillation, always\r\nindicate with the activity of the magnetized needle, the same point of\r\nattraction.\" Nothing more natural, however; it was not from the empire\r\nof the Hapsburg that Hanover and Saxony had to dread certain annexation,\r\nas events have since proved only too clearly. But the man who can one\r\nday desire the destruction of great cities, as the hot-beds of\r\nrevolutionary spirit, did not hesitate to condemn in his soul and\r\nconscience the small States as the inextinguishable hearths of the\r\n\"Austrian spirit.\"\r\n\r\nAustria, in truth, was not slow in taking in the thoughts and the\r\nresentments of the cavalier of the Mark the place which the revolution\r\nhad lately held there, and the ardent champion of Hapsburg in the\r\nchambers of Berlin became little by little their most bitter, most\r\nimplacable enemy in the _Bundestag_. Moreover, all the great men of\r\nPrussia, commencing with the great elector and Frederick II., and\r\nwithout excepting William I., have always had, as regards Austria, \"two\r\nsouls in their breasts\" like Faust, or, like Rebecca, \"two children\r\nconflicting with one another in her bosom;\" in a word, two principles,\r\none of which imbued them with an almost religious respect for the\r\nantique and illustrious imperial house, while the other urged them to\r\nconquest and spoliation at the cost of this very house. In the month of\r\nMay, 1849, the honest and poetical King Frederick William IV. declared\r\nto a deputation of ministers from the Germanic States,[25] \"that he\r\nshould consider that day as the most happy one of his life when he\r\nshould hold the wash basin (_Waschbecken_) at the coronation of a\r\nHapsburg as Emperor of Germany;\" that did not prevent him later from\r\nsmiling from time to time at the work of the parliament of Frankfort,\r\nand from working for the \"restricted union\" under the auspices of\r\nGeneral de Radowitz. And even M. de Bismarck was certainly very sincere\r\nas deputy of the Prussian parliament in his \"Austrian religion,\" when in\r\nthe name of conservative principles he undertook the energetic defense\r\nof the Hapsburg against the attacks of German liberalism; but he was now\r\nthe representative of his government in the Taxis palace, encountered\r\nAustria on its way to a struggle for influence with the secondary\r\nStates, to a struggle of interests concerning the affairs of the Orient,\r\nand he began to engage in an order of ideas, at the end of which he was\r\nto take up the policy of \"heart blow.\" It was thus that on the occasion\r\nof the war in the Orient and in the very city of Frankfort there arose\r\nin the hearts of the two future chancellors of Russia and of Germany\r\nthat hatred of Austria which was to have such fatal consequences, for,\r\nthat the reader may not be deceived, it was the connivance of these two\r\npolitical men,--the fatal ideology of the Emperor Napoleon III. aiding\r\nthem largely, it is just to add,--which rendered possible the\r\ncatastrophes of which our days have been the witnesses: the calamity of\r\nSadowa, and the destruction of the _Bund_, and the dismemberment of\r\nDenmark as well as of France! With Prince Gortchakof, this sentiment of\r\nhostility burst forth suddenly in consequence of an erroneous\r\nappreciation of events, but which his whole nation shared with him. With\r\nM. de Bismarck, the hatred of Austria had not an origin so spontaneous;\r\nit had not, for instance, as an origin, the grievances of Olmuetz, which\r\nthe deputy of the Mark had on the contrary been able to easily overcome;\r\nit was slow in forming, it developed, consolidated itself in consequence\r\nof a long and daily struggle in the heart of the _Bund_, in consequence\r\nof an experience acquired at the end of several years of vain attempts,\r\nand from the definite conviction that Hapsburg would never of its free\r\nwill, abandon the secondary States, and he defended them against every\r\neffort at absorption. Resuming the instruction which his sojourn of\r\neight years at Frankfort had given him, the representative of Prussia to\r\nthe Germanic Confederation wrote in 1859, in his often quoted dispatch\r\nto M. de Schleinitz, those remarkable words: \"I see in our federal\r\nrelations a fault which sooner or later we must cure _ferro et igne_.\"\r\n_Ferro et igne!_ that is the first version of the received text \"iron\r\nand blood,\" which one day the president of the council laid down in an\r\nofficial manner in a speech to the chamber.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the ancient \"Austrian religion\" underwent with its\r\nformer ardent confessor a transformation so radical, a no less curious\r\nchange was wrought in his mind in regard to several other articles of\r\nthe _credo_ of his party. Removed from the _melee_ and participating no\r\nlonger in the parliamentary struggles, he began to observe more coldly\r\ncertain questions important in those times, and to temper more than one\r\nantipathy of past days. Since 1852, on returning from a trip to Berlin,\r\nhe writes: \"There is something demoralizing in the air of the chamber;\r\nthe best men of the world become vain there and cling to the Tribune as\r\na woman to her toilet.... I find parliamentary intrigues hollow and\r\nunworthy of any notice. While one lives in their midst, one has\r\nillusions concerning them, and attaches to them I do not know how much\r\nimportance.... Every time that I arrive there from Frankfort, I\r\nexperience the feelings of a temperate man who falls among drunken\r\npeople.\" Many things in old times disgraceful and abhorred, take now a\r\nless repulsive aspect to the eyes of the statesmen maturing great\r\nprojects for the future. \"The chamber and the press can become the most\r\npowerful instruments of our external policy,\" wrote in 1856 the former\r\ndespiser of parliamentarism and friend of M. Thadden-Triglaff, and it is\r\nthus that one finds in the correspondence of these times the vague idea\r\nof a national representation of the _Zollverein_, even a pronounced\r\ndesire for universal suffrage itself, provided that these means could\r\nbecome the _instrumenta regni_. The example of the second empire\r\nexercised then an influence which the historian should carefully bear in\r\nmind. This system of absolutism tinged with popular passions, \"spotted\r\nwith red,\" to employ a characteristic expression of M. de Bismarck,\r\nseduced the imagination of more than one aspirant for _coups d'etat_ and\r\n_coups d'eclat_, and the former colleague of the Doctor d'Ester must\r\nhave opened his cigar case more than once and contemplated there the\r\nlittle sprig of olive plucked from the tomb of Petrarch and Laura.\r\n\r\nYet the goal seemed distant, and how veiled was the future, still\r\nindistinctly seen! It was not under King Frederick William IV., whose\r\nmind became more and more clouded, that he was permitted to think of\r\naction; even the accession of the regent, the present King William,\r\nseemed at first to make no change in the exterior situation. The new\r\nministers of the regent, the ministers of the _new era_, as was said\r\nthen, were honest doctrinarians who spoke of the development of conceded\r\nliberties and of the strengthening of the representative _regime_. The\r\ngood and _naif_, they even allowed William I. to proclaim solemnly one\r\nday that \"Prussia need only make _moral conquests_ in Germany!\"\r\nEvidently the _new era_ was not yet the era of M. de Bismarck. During\r\nthe years which passed after the war of the Orient until his embassy in\r\nRussia, one sees the representative of Prussia to the Germanic\r\nConfederation in constant motion, on continual journeys across Germany,\r\nFrance, Denmark, Sweden, Courland, and Upper Italy, seeking subjects for\r\ndistraction, or perhaps also subjects for observation, and each time\r\nreturning to Frankfort only to raise a difficulty, break some\r\n_bric-a-brac_, and to press to the utmost the nervous and bilious Count\r\nRechberg, Austrian representative and president of the _Bundestag_. His\r\nfrequent excursions to Paris caused him to have a presentiment of the\r\nevents which were preparing in Italy; he only became more aggressive,\r\nand there was a time when his recall was considered at Frankfort as\r\nindispensable for the maintenance of peace. It was at this moment that\r\nhe thought of definitely abandoning this career, of throwing off the\r\nuniform, and of going into politics in his \"swimming drawers.\" He\r\nconsented, however, to do it in \"a bear-skin and with caviar,\" as he\r\nexpressed himself in one of his letters; in other words called to\r\nexchange his post at Frankfort for that at St. Petersburg. One hoped\r\nthus to remove him from the burning ground, to \"put him on ice\" (another\r\nexpression of M. de Bismarck); as for himself, he perhaps attached other\r\nhopes to this removal, and in any case found consolation in seeing his\r\nformer colleague of Frankfort become principal minister of a great\r\nempire, and with whom he was always on such good terms. The 1st of\r\nApril, 1859, \"the anniversary of his birth,\" M. de Bismarck arrived in\r\nthe capital of Russia.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Plutarch, Theseus, _initio._\r\n\r\n[2] _Aus der Petersburger Gesellschaft_, vol. ii. p. 156.\r\n\r\n[3] Expressions from the Russian circular of the 6th July, 1848,\r\naddressed by Count Nesselrode to his agents in Germany.\r\n\r\n[4] The Germanic Confederation was formed in 1816. Frankfort was chosen\r\nas its seat, whither delegates were sent from all the States of Germany\r\nretaining sovereign rights. These delegates formed the assembly called\r\nthe Diet.\r\n\r\nThe assembly was composed of seventeen envoys, presided over by the\r\nrepresentative of Austria. There were however thirty-one States\r\nexclusive of the free cities, represented in the last period of the\r\nDiet's existence. The Diet was so constituted that each of the following\r\nStates or combination of States had one representative: Austria;\r\nPrussia; Bavaria; Kingdom of Saxony; Hanover; Wuertemberg; Grand Duchy of\r\nBaden; Electorate of Hesse; Grand Ducal Hesse; Denmark, for the Duchies\r\nof Holstein and Lauenburg; The Netherlands, for Limburg and Luxemburg;\r\nThe Duchies of Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and Saxe-Altenburg;\r\nBrunswick and Nassau; The two Mecklenburgs (Schwerin and Strelitz);\r\nOldenburg, Anhalt and two Schwarzburgs (Rudolstadt and Sonderhausen);\r\nLichtenstein, Reuss, Schaumburg Lippe, Lippe Detmold, Waldeck and Hesse\r\nHomburg; The free cities, Lubeck, Frankfort, Bremen and Hamburg.\r\n\r\nThe votes were equal. Sittings were secret.\r\n\r\nOn important occasions the assembly was resolved into what was called\r\nthe _plenum_, in which a greater number of votes were assigned to the\r\nchief States, and the total number of voices was then increased to\r\nseventy. In these cases a majority of three fourths was necessary for\r\nany question to be carried.\r\n\r\nThe leading idea with the founders of the Diet was the preservation of\r\ninternal tranquillity, the next, the formation of a league which should\r\ninspire other nations with respect.\r\n\r\nAmbassadors were accredited to the Diet.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[5] Russian circular of the 27th May, 1859, concerning the war in Italy.\r\n\r\n[6] This young lieutenant was M. de Bismarck.

In one of the confidential\r\nconversations, Francis spoke with sadness and apprehensions of the\r\nsickly and nervous state of his son and prospective successor, and\r\nbegged the czar to maintain towards that son the friendship which he had\r\nalways had for the father. \"Nicholas fell on his knees, and raising his\r\nright hand to heaven, swore to give to the successor of Francis all aid\r\nand succor he should ever need. The old Emperor of Austria was\r\nprofoundly touched, and placed his hands on the head of the kneeling\r\nczar as a token of benediction.\" This strange scene had no witness, but\r\neach of the two sovereigns narrated it some months later to a superior\r\nofficer who then commanded the division of the army stationed at\r\nMunchengraetz. This superior officer was no other than the Prince of\r\nWindischgraetz, who, later, in 1848, nominated and made generalissimo of\r\nthe Austrian army at the critical moment of the Hungarian insurrection,\r\ntook upon himself to recall to Nicholas, in a letter, the pledge\r\nformerly given at Munchengraetz. The czar replied by placing his whole\r\narmy at the disposition of his imperial and apostolic majesty.--Cf.\r\nHefter, _Geschichte Oesterreichs_, Prague, 1869, vol. i. pp. 68-69.\r\n\r\n[8] Session of the Prussian chamber of the 6th September, 1849.

There was then at Vienna,\r\nin the ministry of foreign affairs, a very original figure, an usher,\r\nthe memory of whom is not effaced at the Ballplatz. He bore the uncouth\r\nname of Kadernoschka; placed in the large waiting room before the\r\ncabinet of the minister, it was his duty to introduce the different\r\nvisitors to the chief. This M. Kadernoschka was an usher of great style:\r\nhe had been trained by the old Prince Metternich himself and loved to\r\nrecall that he had \"exercised his functions\" from the time of the famous\r\ncongress of 1815! One day, after a long interview with Prince\r\nGortchakof, Count Buol sees this good Kadernoschka entering with a more\r\nthan usually solemn air. He had a communication to make to his\r\nExcellency \"in the interest of the service!\" And Count Buol learns that\r\nthe Russian envoy, after having left his Excellency, had appeared\r\nentirely overcome and suffocating with anger,--that he had asked for a\r\nglass of water; that for half an hour he had walked up and down in the\r\nwaiting room, gesticulating with violence, talking to himself, and\r\ncrying from time to time in French: \"Oh! some day they shall pay me well\r\nfor that, they shall pay me for that!\"\r\n\r\n[11] Protocol of the conference of the 17th April, 1855.\r\n\r\n[12] A religious ceremony which, in the Protestant Church, corresponds\r\nin a certain degree to the first communion in the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\n[13] Referring to Henry IV., Emperor of Germany from 1056 to 1106, who\r\nhumbled himself before Pope Gregory VII. at Canossa in 1077.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[14] Referring to the closing words of Cato's speeches: _Caeterum censeo\r\nCarthaginem esse delendam_.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[15] Treaty of Gastein, 14th August, 1865, between Austria and Prussia\r\non the one side and Denmark on the other.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[16] _Sturm and Drang-Periode_, first period of Goethe and Schiller.\r\n\r\n[17] Varzin, the Tusculum of the German chancellor, is situated in\r\nPomerania, to the right of the Stettin-Danzig road, and about ten miles\r\nfrom Schlawe.

See also the\r\ninterpellation of M.

Still full of the conviction that they had made on\r\nDenmark a war \"eminently iniquitous, frivolous, and revolutionary,\" the\r\nPrussian plenipotentiary to the _Bund_ labored, in 1852, very actively\r\nin dissipating for the future a possible cause of perturbation, and\r\nnegotiated an Esau bargain with the Duke Christian-August Augustenburg,\r\nthe former upholder of _Schleswig-Holsteinism_, and eventual pretender\r\nto the Duchies. Thanks to the intervention of M. de Bismarck, the old\r\nduke signed for the sum of one million and a half rixdalers given by the\r\ngovernment of Copenhagen, a solemn act, by which he bound \"_himself and\r\nhis family_, on his princely word and honor, to undertake nothing which\r\ncould disturb the tranquillity of the Danish monarchy.\" That did not\r\nprevent the son of Christian from impudently insisting on his pretended\r\nrights in 1863, nor even M. de Bismarck from supporting them for a\r\ncertain time, up to the moment when the famous syndics of the crown cast\r\nthe doubt in the soul of the first minister at Berlin and proved to him\r\nthat the Duchies, belonging by right to no one, belonged to King William\r\nby the fact of conquest.\r\n\r\n[25] The minister of Nassau, Baron Max de Gagern was at the head of this\r\ndeputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nA NATIONAL MINISTER AND A FAULT-FINDING DIPLOMAT AT ST. PETERSBURG.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIn the prodigious development which advanced the empire of the czars\r\nafter the impulse which the genius of Peter the Great had given it, one\r\ncan certainly signalize more than one Russian minister of foreign\r\naffairs whose name has a right to be commemorated by history. For\r\ninstance, the mind of Count Panine was not an ordinary one, who\r\nconceived and caused to be accepted by different states the idea of\r\n_armed neutrality_ at sea, and this at an epoch when Russia scarcely\r\nbegan to be reckoned among the maritime powers of the second or third\r\nclass. If in this bold conception, as well as in the still more\r\ninteresting attempts of Panine to limit the absolute power of the czars\r\nby aristocratic institutions, the remote influence of an Italian origin\r\ncould be seen (the Panine descended from the Pagnini of Lucca), one\r\ncannot, however, overlook the perfectly indigenous, largely,\r\nautochthonal character of another famous minister of the same century,\r\nthat of the Chancellor Bestoujef, whose figure Rulhiere has drawn so\r\nvery originally. Bestoujef, who spoke perfectly, feigned stammering, and\r\nhad the courage to simulate this defect for seventeen years. In his\r\nconversations with foreign ambassadors he stammered in such a manner as\r\nnot to be understood. He also complained of being deaf, of not\r\nunderstanding all the _finesses_ of the French language, and had the\r\nsame thing repeated a thousand times. He was in the habit of writing\r\ndiplomatic notes with his own hand in a manner perfectly illegible. They\r\nwere sent back to him and sometimes he could decipher their meaning.\r\nHaving fallen into disgrace, Bestoujef immediately recovered his speech,\r\nhearing, and all the senses.\r\n\r\nVery different is the type which was presented during all of the first\r\nhalf of this century by the immediate predecessor of Prince Gortchakof,\r\nthe chancellor of the emperors Alexander I. and Nicholas. Connected with\r\nGermany by origin and the interests of his family, never even having\r\nlearned to speak the language of the country whose relations with other\r\npowers he watched over, Count Charles Robert de Nesselrode did not the\r\nless complete a long and laborious career to the satisfaction of his two\r\naugust masters, and figured with honor in congresses and conferences at\r\nthe side of Talleyrand and Metternich. Without having recourse to the\r\ntoo Asiatic subterfuges of a Bestoujef, Count Nesselrode knew and\r\npracticed all the allowable tricks of the profession, and few men\r\nequaled him in the art of preserving an air of dignity and ease in the\r\nmidst of the most embarrassing situations. He knew how to change his\r\nconduct without too great a change of language, and among other things\r\nmanaged in a very delicate manner the transition between the policy of\r\nthe czar Alexander I. (unfavorable to the Greeks) and the frankly\r\nphilhellenic sympathies of his successor. During the last Oriental\r\ncrisis he placed all the resources of a shrewd and subtle mind at the\r\nservice of a cause in which he saw nothing but grave dangers, and of\r\nwhich he ignored the national and religious side completely. Differing\r\nfrom Bestoujef, and much more European in this sense than in many\r\nothers, M. de Nesselrode lost in his disgrace or rather in his retreat,\r\nthe greater part of his faculties and his virtues, and above all caused\r\nan immense deception by his posthumous memoirs, composed in the decline\r\nof life and of a hopeless insignificance. But perhaps this was nothing\r\nbut a last trait of cleverness and diplomatic malice in order to deceive\r\non this point profane curiosity, and to leave behind him a work as empty\r\nand uninstructive as possible of a life so well filled.\r\n\r\nNot one, however, of the Russian statesmen who have just been named was\r\na great minister in the Occidental acceptation of the word. No one of\r\nthem (in order to make comparisons in absolute monarchies only) had the\r\nposition of a Duke de Choiseul in France during the last century, the\r\nauthority of a Prince Clement de Metternich in Austria in the present\r\ncentury, or even the notoriety and popularity which Prince Gortchakof\r\nactually enjoys in Russia itself. Bestoujef, Panine, Nesselrode were,\r\none may say, much better known abroad than in their own country, and\r\ntheir contemporaries were far from attributing to them the merit which\r\nposterity later saw in them, thanks to the posthumous revelations of the\r\narchives. No one of them was raised to power by a current of opinion,\r\nnor sustained in his position by public favor; not one of them\r\npretended to show an individuality, to impress a personal direction on\r\nthe affairs, which he conducted. This is because since Peter the Great\r\nto the present government, the _eclat_ of the imperial name in Russia\r\ncast into the shade every other name, and instead of being a favorite or\r\na great captain, every state servant was only the subaltern executor of\r\na single and absolute will. The external policy, above all, was then\r\nconsidered as the exclusive domain of the sovereign, and the very fixity\r\nof the system rendered in some degree secondary and unimportant the\r\nquestion of the persons charged with fulfilling it. In fact, from the\r\ntime of Peter the Great, the Russian government has always had in its\r\nrelations with Europe certain traditions approved by experience, and\r\ncertain sacred principles, from which it never deviated even in a small\r\ndegree. The minister of foreign affairs at St. Petersburg, whatever his\r\nname might be, always had to labor to augment Russian _prestige_ among\r\nthe Christian populations of the Orient, to guard the maintenance of the\r\nequilibrium of power between Austria and Prussia, and to extend the\r\ninfluence of his government among the secondary States of Germany. To\r\nthese rules, so to speak, elementary and invariable, of the external\r\nRussian policy, there was added from the year 1815 an international\r\nprinciple of preservation, a superior idea of solidarity between the\r\ngovernments for the defense of established order, the feeling of the\r\nduties and of the common interests created in the representatives of the\r\nmonarchical authority in opposition to subversive passions sprung from\r\nthe revolution, and it was this _ensemble_ of the views and convictions\r\nof the two emperors Alexander I. and Nicholas which Count Nesselrode\r\nhad, during almost half a century, to enforce, in all the acts and\r\ndocuments emanating from the chancellor's office at St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nIt has been the destiny of the successor of Count Nesselrode to break\r\nlittle by little with all this _ensemble_ of traditions and principles,\r\nand to inaugurate for the empire of the czars, in its external\r\nrelations, an entirely new policy. One may dispute the merit of this\r\npolicy, and dispute it the more widely as it is still far from having\r\nborne all its fruit. What is indisputable and astonishes at first sight,\r\nis that Prince Gortchakof has been able to attach his name to a change\r\nof system which is marked in the diplomatic annals of his country, and\r\nto create for himself, as minister of foreign affairs in Russia, a\r\nsituation entirely personal, an important position, such as none of his\r\npredecessors ever had. Alexander Mikhailovitch is not only the faithful\r\nservant of his august master, he is the veritable chief of his\r\ndepartment, the directing minister; he accepts boldly his part of the\r\nresponsibility, and above all his share of the _eclat_ in the different\r\ntransactions of Europe. An equally new phenomenon in Russia, this\r\nminister not only retains the favor of his sovereign, but also that of\r\nthe nation. He manages the public opinion of his country, he watches\r\nover it, sometimes he even flatters it, and it repays him. It has had\r\nsome moments of infatuation for Alexander Mikhailovitch, even some\r\nmoments of enthusiasm,--after the affairs of Poland; more than that, it\r\nhas in a measure brought forward and created him. This elevation of the\r\nplenipotentiary of Vienna to the high position left vacant by Count\r\nNesselrode in the month of April, 1856, was not without its results.\r\n\r\nIn 1815, on his triumphal return from the congress of Vienna, Alexander\r\ncould select as he wished from the celebrated men who then formed the\r\n_etat-major_ of Russian diplomacy, the least known and the most humble\r\nof this illustrious body. Passing over Capo d'Istria, Pozzo di Borgo,\r\nRibeaupierre, Razoumovsky, Stakelberg, d'Anstett, it was lawful for him\r\nto confide the direction of the external policy to a German gentleman of\r\nWestphalian origin, born at Lisbon, and Russian only by naturalization.\r\nIn 1856, after the congress of Paris, the choice of Prince Gortchakof\r\nfor the same position was, we will not say imposed, but certainly\r\nindicated to the Emperor Alexander II. by the voice of the people, or,\r\nif one likes it better, by that voice of the _salons_ which did not\r\ndelay at this moment in taking more and more a popular tone. And since\r\nhis _debut_ at the Hotel of the Place du Palais the former pupil of\r\nZarkoe-Zeloe distinguished himself by liberal ways and advances made in\r\na public spirit, which must have occasionally astonished his\r\npredecessor, still living and in possession of the honored title of\r\nchancellor. For the first time, a Russian minister had _mots_, not only\r\nfor the _salons_, but also for the lecture halls and the bureaux of\r\njournalists, words which went straight to the heart of the great lady\r\nand country gentleman, the humble student and proud officer of the\r\n_gardes_. His aphorism on Austria[26] went the rounds of all the\r\nRussias. Another aphorism, taken from a circular, soon transported the\r\nnation: the celebrated phrase, \"Russia does not sulk, but meditates,\"\r\nseemed to be dictated by the very soul of the people, and drew from it a\r\ncry of enthusiasm. It was then that one remembered the awakening of the\r\nRussian spirit after a long period of compression; the journals, the\r\nthoughtful periodicals, inaugurated their joyful _ebats_, the authors,\r\nthe literary men, began to have an importance hitherto unknown;\r\nAlexander Mikhailovitch, who always displayed a liking and sympathy for\r\nRussian literature, the former fellow scholar of Pouchkine, passed for a\r\npatriotic statesman in the eyes of Pogodine, Axakof, Katkof, etc. One\r\nperceived that he had a great hatred for Austria, a pronounced desire\r\nfor the French alliance, and the nation, which also shared equally and\r\neven in an exaggerated manner, these two sentiments, saluted in him the\r\nnational minister _par excellence_. A strange comparison, well made to\r\ndemonstrate the inanity of words and the instability of things on earth,\r\nis the manner in which the most decided partisan of the empire of the\r\nHapsburg, M. de Bismarck, the future conqueror of Sadowa, entered into\r\nthe _caenaculum_ of diplomats; and at the same time it was the implacable\r\nenemy of the Germans and the warm friend of the French whom, in 1856,\r\nthe Russians exalted above all in the person of their vice-chancellor,\r\nthe statesman who, later, by a policy of omission and commission, was to\r\nfavor as no one else did, the dismemberment of France and the\r\nconstitution of a Germany greater, more powerful, and more formidable\r\nthan the history of past centuries has ever known! It is true that by\r\nthe \"Germans\" the Russia of 1856 meant principally the Austrians,[27]\r\nand that in the France of that day it admired above all a certain\r\nabsolutism in the democratic instincts which showed itself touched with\r\nthe misfortunes of Italy, which professed to sympathize with Roumania,\r\nServia, Montenegro, and which had not yet pronounced the fatal name of\r\nPoland.\r\n\r\n\"Calm yourself,\" the emperor of the French said to M. de Cavour, in the\r\nmonth of April, 1856, after the closing of the congress of Paris,--\"Calm\r\nyourself; I have a presentiment that the present peace will not last\r\nlong.\"[28] Prince Gortchakof had without doubt the same presentiment,\r\nand perhaps others more positive in this respect. The thought of \"making\r\nwar for an idea,\" the thought of freeing Italy, had long been fixed in\r\nthe mind of Napoleon III.; at the moment of signing the treaty of Paris\r\n\"with an eagle's feather,\" he let his hidden and dreaming glance fall on\r\nthe classic plains of Lombardy. Now, for the enterprise which France\r\nmeditated against Austria, and in which it could scarcely count on an\r\nangry neutrality of England, it was thought useful to secure in good\r\nseason the friendship of Russia and Prussia. Prussia had emerged from\r\nthe Oriental crisis very much weakened with its policy \"of the free\r\nhand;\" England, Austria, and Turkey had even had little desire to admit\r\nit to the honors of the congress. The president of the council at\r\nBerlin, M. de Manteuffel, was obliged to wait long in the antechamber,\r\nwhile the plenipotentiaries of Europe were in full deliberation, and it\r\nwas only at the instance of the emperor of the French that the Prussian\r\nenvoy was at last admitted. Napoleon III. insisted absolutely, in 1856,\r\non allowing _that_ Prussia to retake its position in Europe which\r\nfourteen years later was to dethrone him! As for Russia, we have already\r\nspoken of the politenesses and cordialities of which Count Orlof was the\r\nrecipient from France during all the time of the congress. Since then,\r\nin the successive arrangements of the various difficulties which the\r\nexecution of some of the clauses of the treaty of Paris caused to arise\r\n(Belgrade, Isle of Serpents, navigation of the Danube, etc.), one saw\r\nthe arguments or interpretations of the Russian plenipotentiary\r\nsustained almost constantly by the plenipotentiary of France. In the\r\ndifferent and numerous conferences and commissions which followed in\r\nthese years, 1856-1859, for regulating the pending questions, the\r\ndistribution of the votes was almost invariably thus: England and\r\nAustria on one side, on the other France, Russia, and Prussia.[29]\r\n\r\nAlthough Prince Gortchakof acknowledged with good grace all these\r\nattentions of the cabinet of the Tuileries, he was not sufficiently\r\ncomplaisant to follow it in a campaign of remonstrances against the\r\ngovernment of Naples, a campaign undertaken in concert with the cabinet\r\nof Saint James, in consequence of the famous letters addressed to Lord\r\nAberdeen by M. Gladstone on the _regime_ of King Ferdinand II. A similar\r\nintermeddling in the internal affairs of an independent state did not\r\nseem very correct in the eyes of the successor of Count Nesselrode; but\r\nhe was the more forward in seconding the Emperor Napoleon III. in his\r\ngenerous designs every time that there was a question of ameliorating\r\nthe lot of the Christian populations in the Ottoman empire, of\r\naugmenting their autonomy, and, as was said then, of _reforming the\r\nTurk_. \"To reform the Turk,\" maliciously thought M. Thouvenel,\r\nambassador of France at Constantinople, \"it is necessary to begin by\r\nfirst impaling him;\" one commenced, however, by applying to him the\r\nquestion of _hatt-houmayoum_, by interrogating him concerning his\r\nintentions in favor of the rajahs of Bosnia, Bulgaria, and Herzegovina,\r\nand by thus annoying in a certain degree the cabinets of Vienna and\r\nLondon. Much greater was naturally the solicitude for the vassal States\r\nof the good padishah, for Moldavia, Wallachia, Servia, and Montenegro;\r\nthese States already had a demi-independence, they made it possible to\r\nrender it entire.\r\n\r\nThe little Prince of Montenegro, former _protege_ and servitor of the\r\nEmperor Nicholas, had come to visit the sovereign of France after the\r\npeace of Paris, and since his return had quarreled with the sultan, in\r\nconsequence of which the _Algesiras_ and _L'Impetueuse_ appeared before\r\nRagusa. French vessels in the waters of the Orient to menace Turkey, to\r\nthe great mortification of England and Austria, to the great rejoicings\r\nof Russia, all this scarcely two years after the war in the Crimea! The\r\nsight was surely not wanting in originality, and prepared the world for\r\na series of surprises. At about the same time, Servia expelled Prince\r\nAlexander Kara Georgevitch, and recalled to the throne the old Miloch\r\nObrenovitch. The Porte protested, England and Austria joined in this\r\nprotest; but, thanks to the combined efforts of Russia and France, they\r\nended by acknowledging the right of the national Servian assembly, whose\r\nprincipal grievance against the dethroned prince was his having shown\r\ntoo much sympathy for the allies in the war of 1853! The question of the\r\nDanubian Principalities presented an aspect serious, and also _piquant_.\r\nFrance and Russia had begged at the congress of Paris for the complete\r\nunion of Moldavia and Wallachia; the other Powers were opposed to it,\r\nand, weary of war, they had agreed to accept a combination which\r\ncompletely assimilated the administration in the two countries, while\r\nmaintaining their separation. It was, as later in Italy, the project of\r\nconfederation opposed to that of unity; but then there was also given on\r\nthe banks of the Danube the first example of that national strategy,\r\nwhich was soon to show itself on a larger scale in Tuscany and Emelia.\r\nThe twofold election of Prince Couza was in truth the first trial of\r\nthat popular diplomacy, which later, in Italian affairs, took pleasure\r\nin so often confounding the combinations of high plenipotentiaries and\r\nhigh contracting parties, and proclaimed in the face of the world a deed\r\naccomplished by the suffrage of the nation. The popular votes annulling\r\nthe arrangements of diplomacy, and the understanding of France and\r\nRussia to respect these votes, these are the two salient traits of the\r\npolicy in the years 1856-1859, a policy which the liberal opinion of\r\nEurope received with favor without being too much astonished at such a\r\nconcordance of views between the cabinets of the Tuileries and St.\r\nPetersburg on this very ground of the Orient, still warm with the\r\nbullets of the war; on this ground, from which Russia should have been,\r\nin the opinion of the allies of 1853, completely shut out, and where she\r\nnow regained influence and a footing, modestly it is true, and under the\r\nprotecting shadow of France.\r\n\r\nAt last the Italian complications came, and the government of the czar\r\nincreased the testimonials of his good relations with the cabinet of the\r\nTuileries. \"Our relations with France are _cordial_,\" replied Prince\r\nGortchakof to Lord Napier, charged by his government with sounding the\r\ndisposition of Russia in such grave matters. England then made earnest\r\nefforts to prevent the war in Italy from breaking out. Lord Cowley, sent\r\nwith a certain flourish on a mission to Vienna, exerted himself to\r\ndiscover the possible bases of an accommodation, and the cabinet of St.\r\nJames already flattered itself with the hope of having quelled the\r\ntempest, when Prince Gortchakof suddenly proposed a _congress_, and\r\npronounced that fatal word which then, as so often since, was only the\r\nsignal for a rupture. A congress! A treaty of peace before any\r\nhostility, the glory of the triumph without the peril of victory,--that\r\nwas the eternal _hysteron-proteron_ of the Napoleonic ideology, that was\r\nthe chimera pursued by the dreamer of Ham in the question of the Papacy,\r\nin the question of Poland, and of Denmark; and up to the catastrophe of\r\n1870, after the declaration of war, it is curious to see Prince\r\nGortchakof first suggest a remedy which imperial France was yet to\r\nrecommend so often for all the chronic evils of Europe.[30] The chief of\r\nthe English government, the old Earl of Derby, complained bitterly of\r\nthe horrible trick which the proposition emanating from St. Petersburg\r\nhad played him, and there has never been any doubt in England but that\r\nit was brought about by a telegram sent from Paris. Not less serviceable\r\nfor France did the Russian vice-chancellor show himself in his circular\r\nof the 27th May, 1859, when he endeavored to calm the warlike ardor of\r\nthe secondary States of Germany, and it was in this celebrated dispatch\r\nthat he made the judicious demonstration as well as the merited praise\r\nof the \"combination purely and exclusively defensive\" of the _Bund_, a\r\nsalutary combination which permitted the localization of a war become\r\ninevitable, \"in place of generalizing it and giving to the struggle a\r\ncharacter and proportions which escape all human foresight.\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon III. descended to the plains of Lombardy; Austria was\r\nvanquished at Magenta and Solferino, and Russia could enjoy its first\r\nrevenge on the ungrateful Hapsburg, who had \"betrayed\" it before\r\nSebastopol. The year after, in consequence of the annexation of Savoy,\r\nLord Russell made the solemn declaration to the parliament that his\r\ncountry \"should not separate itself from the rest of the nations of\r\nEurope; that it should always be ready to act with the different states,\r\nif it did not wish to dread to-day such an annexation, and to-morrow to\r\nhear another spoken of.\" That was the funeral oration of the\r\nAnglo-French alliance: four years after the war of the Crimea, France\r\nhad lost one and then the other of its two great allies in the crisis of\r\nthe Orient, and Russia did not care to complain. It did not protest\r\nagainst the annexation of Savoy; it even declared that it only saw in it\r\na \"regular transaction;\" but it profited by the moment to make its\r\nreentry into European politics, and bring back on the tapis the question\r\n... of the Ottoman empire! The 4th May, 1860, Prince Gortchakof\r\nconvoked in his cabinet the ambassadors of the great Powers in order to\r\nexamine with them the \"dolorous and precarious\" position of the\r\nChristians in Bosnia, Herzegovina and Bulgaria, and soon a circular of\r\nthe vice-chancellor (20th May) insisted on the reunion of a conference\r\nin order to alter the stipulations established by the treaty of Paris.\r\n\"The time of illusions is passed,\" Alexander Mikhailovitch wrote in this\r\ncircular; \"all hesitation every adjournment will bring grave\r\ninconvenience,\" and he even seized upon the recent liberation of Italy\r\nas an argument for the future independence of the populations who\r\nawakened all his solicitude: \"the events accomplished in the east of\r\nEurope have resounded in all the Orient _like an encouragement and like\r\na hope_!\" Thus, scarcely four years after the treaty of Paris, Russia\r\nbegan anew to speak to the world of the \"sick man,\" and to do it, it did\r\nnot shelter itself, as in the conferences and commissions of 1856-1859,\r\nunder the protection and language of France; it went all alone, and took\r\nthe initiative in the debate!\r\n\r\nThis was not enough: in that year alone, 1860, the cabinet of St.\r\nPetersburg regained almost all the ground lost since the war of the\r\nCrimea; that was a year of peculiar fortune for Russia, for it was a\r\nyear of universal distrust of France. The acquisition of Savoy, the\r\nstrange and profoundly immoral spectacle which the negotiations of this\r\ntreaty of Zurich offered, torn up even before being signed, the\r\nPiedmontese annexations in Italy, the expedition of Garibaldi to Sicily,\r\nthe \"new right\" of which the official journals in France spoke, and the\r\nfamous pamphlet on the \"Pope and Congress,\" had caused the alarm and\r\nawakened in the highest degree the uneasiness of Europe. Lord Palmerston\r\ndeclared \"that he would only be willing to give his hand to a former\r\nally in holding the other on the buckler of defense,\" and he armed his\r\n_volunteers_. Switzerland was violently agitated; the _National-Verein_\r\nswore to die for the defense of the Rhine, and even those honest and\r\npeaceful Belgians affirmed in an address to the king that \"if their\r\nindependence was menaced, they would submit to the most severe trials.\"\r\nAbove these popular frights the cabals of the sovereigns were agitated;\r\nthe German princes united at Baden, and the emperor of the French\r\nthought it opportune to surprise them in a measure in the midst of their\r\ndeliberations by making that \"rapid voyage\" from which the \"Moniteur\"\r\npromised \"very happy results.\" \"Nothing was wanting but the spontaneity\r\nof a proceeding so significant,\" added the official journal, \"to put an\r\nend to this unanimous concert of malicious rumors and false estimations.\r\nIn truth, the emperor, in explaining frankly to the sovereigns united at\r\nBaden how his policy never conflicted with right and justice, carried to\r\nminds equally distinguished and equally exempt from prejudices, the\r\nconviction which does not fail to be inspired by a true sentiment\r\nexpressed with loyalty.\" It appeared, however, that the conviction had\r\nnot worked completely on the prejudices, for, at the close of the\r\nreunion of Baden, there was another at Toeplitz, between the Emperor of\r\nAustria and the Prince Regent of Prussia, where they agreed on a third\r\nwhich was to be held at Warsaw with the Emperor of Russia,--and the\r\nczar accepted the _rendezvous_.\r\n\r\n\"It is not a coalition, it is a reconciliation which I am going to make\r\nat Warsaw,\" declared the Emperor Alexander II. to the French ambassador,\r\nthe Duke of Montebello, whose government was naturally much agitated by\r\nthe turn affairs were taking. In truth, conciliating expressions were\r\nnot wanting in the dispatch by which Prince Gortchakof \"invited the\r\nFrench government to let him know in what measure it thought that it\r\nwould be able to second the efforts which Russia was making to prevent\r\n_the crisis with which Europe was menaced_;\" but, however polite these\r\nforms were, they did not hide a necessity for explanation. The cabinet\r\nof the Tuileries replied by a memorandum in which it gave, above all,\r\n\"the categoric engagement not to give any support to Piedmont in case\r\nthat Austria should be attacked in Venetia.\" The cabinets of Vienna and\r\nBerlin made their remarks on several points of the French memorandum,\r\nand addressed them ... to the Russian vice-chancellor, who transmitted\r\nthem to Paris, with the request for new explanations more explicit and\r\nmore reassuring. Sum total, no positive result came from this meeting of\r\nthe three sovereigns of the North, who had for a moment caused very\r\ngrave apprehensions in France. This was because the Emperor Alexander\r\nhad gone to Warsaw only in a particular interest; he did not wish to\r\nmake a coalition nor a reconciliation there; he simply wished to show\r\nhis influence: to give a demonstration of his power. He was flattered at\r\nseeing these sovereigns, these German princes, coming to the former\r\ncapital of Poland to deliberate there on the general situation, and to\r\nreceive the word of command: that recalled the good days of the Emperor\r\nNicholas. On the other side, Russia was very much pleased at making\r\nFrance feel the whole price of its friendship, at making it understand\r\nthat its services had now a much greater value, perhaps even their\r\ntariff. The clever productions which emanated successively in these\r\nyears 1856-1860 from the chancellor's office at St. Petersburg,\r\nindicated in a very plastic manner the continually ascending advance of\r\nRussia since the peace of Paris. In the first of these celebrated\r\ncirculars, it declared \"that it did not sulk, but meditated;\" in the\r\nsecond, on the occasion of the Italian complications, it already emerged\r\n\"from the reserve which it had imposed on itself since the war of the\r\nCrimea.\" After the annexation of Savoy \"its conscience warned it of\r\nbeing any longer silent on the unhappy state of the Christians in the\r\nOrient, etc.\" At last, in the month of October, 1860, it was the\r\nmouth-piece of the general interests of Europe, the intermediary which\r\ndemanded explanations from the cabinets of the Tuileries. A modest\r\n_protege_ of France, and full of \"reserves\" until the war in Italy, it\r\nascends in 1859 to the rank of a \"precious friend,\" to become after the\r\ninterview of Warsaw the important and almost indispensable ally,--an\r\nally very resolute in not accepting a secondary _role_, in guarding its\r\nposition of marked influence, in taking for itself a large part in the\r\ngreat combinations of the future.\r\n\r\nAssuredly the desultory, undecisive, and eternally contradictory policy\r\nof the Emperor Napoleon III. played into the hands of Russia. But it is\r\njust to acknowledge that Prince Gortchakof allowed no chance of fortune\r\nto escape, and that without creating the events, he understood admirably\r\nhow to profit by them. The superiority of the statesman always reveals\r\nitself by the measure which he preserves in his \"cordiality\" and even in\r\nhis vengeance, by the foreseeing mind which he does not cease to\r\npreserve even in the midst of the allurements of success. It is not\r\ndoubtful for instance that the warnings of Russia after the battle of\r\nSolferino, the fears which it then suddenly expressed of not being able\r\nlonger to restrain Germany in its ardor to go to the rescue of Austria,\r\ncontributed greatly to the hasty peace of Villafranca, and, however\r\nfatal this event was as regards the interests of France and even of\r\nAustria, one cannot deny that Russia accomplished its purpose perfectly.\r\nIn fact, the complete execution of the programme \"of the Alps to the\r\nAdriatic\" would have probably given an entirely different turn to the\r\nItalian affairs, would certainly have rendered possible in the future a\r\nsincere reconciliation between France and Austria, while the half drawn\r\nsolution by the peace of Villafranca, leaving all the questions in\r\nsuspense, could only embitter the relations of the two belligerents, and\r\nrender the friendship of Russia more precious to France. On the other\r\nside, this campaign of Lombardy, while giving satisfaction to the\r\nMuscovite hatred sprung from the war of the Orient, was still far from\r\ndestroying one of the fundamental elements of the traditional policy of\r\nthe czars as regards Germany. In spite of the loss of Milan, Austria\r\npreserved its position intact in the centre of Europe, was a balance for\r\nPrussia, and the interview of Warsaw proved that the Russian influence\r\namong the Germanic States had certainly not decreased.\r\n\r\nNot less circumspect and skillful did the Russian vice-chancellor show\r\nhimself in not compromising too far in his connivances with the Emperor\r\nNapoleon III. during these years 1856-1860, certain general principles\r\nof preservation which had made the greatness and strength of the reign\r\nof Nicholas. Without doubt, in Servia, in the Danubian Principalities,\r\nAlexander Mikhailovitch was not of a vigorous orthodoxy, and allowed\r\npopular votes to annul there the arrangements stipulated by the\r\ntreaties; but in comparison with those countries of the Orient Russia\r\nhas always allowed itself many political licenses. In the affairs of the\r\nOccident, on the contrary, Prince Gortchakof took care to remain as far\r\nas possible in the traditions and not to overturn too much in the \"new\r\nright.\" He let the journals and periodicals of Moscow and St. Petersburg\r\nplume themselves at their ease on what Russia boldly contributed to the\r\ndeliverance of the peoples and to the triumph of nationalities; for\r\nhimself, in the documents dated at his office, he refrained carefully\r\nfrom all these neologisms and persevered in the terminology consecrated\r\nby the old diplomatic language. In these documents he had not spoken at\r\nall of the national aspirations nor of the popular votes, when Milan and\r\nSavoy changed masters; in the eyes of the Russian vice-chancellor, all\r\nthese were simply facts of war, \"regular transactions.\" Still less did\r\nhe care to make the revolutionary propaganda abroad and to associate\r\nhimself in the commerce of exportation which, according to a malicious\r\nremark of those days, Napoleon III. had undertaken with liberal ideas.\r\nHe declined categorically all participation in the remonstrances\r\naddressed to the King of Naples, and declared in his circular of the 22d\r\nSeptember, 1856, \"that to wish to obtain from a sovereign concessions as\r\nto the internal government of his states in a comminatory manner or by\r\nmenacing demonstrations, was to substitute one's self violently on one's\r\nown authority, to govern in his place, and to proclaim without disguise\r\nthe right of the strong over the weak.\" Lastly, in his famous note to\r\nPrince Gagarine of the 10th October, 1860, he took up the Sardinian\r\ngovernment roundly for its conduct in Emilia, Tuscany, the Duchies of\r\nParma and Modena, and strongly opposed the deposal of these princes and\r\nthe annexations of those provinces, which six years later he was to\r\ntolerate, even favor in Germany. \"It is no longer,\" he said in the\r\ndispatch to Prince Gagarine, \"a question of Italian interests, but of\r\ngeneral interests, common to all governments, it is a question which is\r\ndirectly connected with those eternal laws without which, neither order,\r\npeace, nor security can exist in Europe.\" Finally, he sneered at those\r\nJenners of politics who recommend the vaccination of anarchy to remove\r\nfrom it its pernicious character, and who pretend to remove the arms\r\nfrom the demagogy in appropriating to themselves its baggage; \"the\r\nnecessity in which the Sardinian government pretends to be situated in\r\ncombating anarchy does not justify it, since _it only moves with the\r\nrevolution to recover by it its heritage_.\" In a word, the Russian\r\nvice-chancellor profited with prodigious dexterity by the good\r\ndisposition of France and still more by its errors, without ever\r\nsacrificing the will, the decorum, and the principles of his own\r\ngovernment to it. He made use of the Emperor Napoleon III. without using\r\nhim too much, and above all without ever subjecting himself to an order\r\nof ideas in which Russia could find any deception. For the good of\r\nRussia, for the happiness of Europe, it would have been desirable for\r\nPrince Gortchakof to have observed later, in his intimacy with Prussia,\r\na little of that care and that intelligent egotism which he gave proof\r\nof in such a superior manner in his intimacy with France. \"To love,\r\nthere must be two,\" said the great theologian of the Middle Ages on the\r\nsubject that those centuries of faith called divine love, the relations\r\nof the human soul with its heavenly Creator. The precept is assuredly\r\nmuch more to be recommended in the much less mystical relations between\r\nthe powers of the earth, and the Russian vice-chancellor did not forget\r\nit during that first period of his ministry, during those years of\r\n\"cordiality\" with the cabinet of the Tuileries. It was only during the\r\nsecond period that the heart of Alexander Mikhailovitch began to control\r\nthe right of the state, and that the love for M. de Bismarck proved to\r\nbe stronger than the world, stronger even than Russia and its interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nWhile Prince Gortchakof thus reaped the fruits of his \"French\" policy,\r\namong which that of vengeance on Austria was surely not the least sweet\r\nor pleasant, his former colleague of Frankfort, having become\r\nrepresentative of Prussia at the court of Russia, was consumed at his\r\nside by the languishing fever of a man of action trammeled by foolish\r\nprobity. He had arrived at St. Petersburg in the spring of the year\r\n1859, three months after the famous birthday reception given to M. de\r\nHuebner by the Emperor Napoleon III.; the Italian complications were\r\nabout to break out, and the Russian vice-chancellor lent himself to all\r\nthose diplomatic tricks which, according to the desire of the cabinet of\r\nthe Tuileries, would drive the Emperor Francis Joseph to a declaration\r\nof war. The new plenipotentiary of Prussia at the court of St.\r\nPetersburg had not a moment of doubt concerning the bearing which his\r\ngovernment should observe in circumstances so propitious. It was from\r\nthis time (12th May, 1859) that his confidential dispatch to M. de\r\nSchleinitz dates, in which he recommends the rupture with the _Bund_,\r\nthe radical proceeding by sword and fire, _ferro et igne_. In the\r\npreceding year, during a journey to Paris, he had occasion to have an\r\ninterview with the Emperor of the French, and to recognize his good will\r\ntoward Prussia, and the unqualified wishes which were expressed in the\r\nTuileries for the greatness and the prosperity of the country of\r\nFrederick II. and of Bluecher. In the month of November of that same year\r\n1858, Napoleon III. had charged the Marquis Pepoli, then _en route_ for\r\nBerlin, to represent to the Hohenzollern all the advantages which he\r\nwould find in a rupture with Austria: \"In Germany,\" the Emperor of the\r\nFrench had said, \"Austria represents the past, Prussia represents the\r\nfuture; in linking itself to Austria, Prussia condemns itself to\r\nimmobility; it cannot be thus contented; it is called to a higher\r\nfortune; it should accomplish in Germany the great destinies which await\r\nit, and which Germany awaits from it.\"[31] Thus thought the future\r\nprisoner of Wilhelmshoehe on the eve of Magenta and Solferino, and \"his\r\nexcellency the lieutenant\" certainly found no objections in such a\r\nmagnificent programme. But those good ministers of the _new era_ at\r\nBerlin unfortunately had not the slightest notion of the \"new right,\"\r\nand up to the prince regent himself, they did not cease to speak of\r\nconquests purely _moral_. They even asked one another at Potsdam if they\r\nshould not assist Austria, and whether they did not have federal\r\nobligations towards the Emperor Francis Joseph! The Samson of the Mark\r\nstrove in vain against the ties which the \"Philistines of the Spree\"\r\nimposed on him, and the war in Italy became his Dalila: in fact, it was\r\nfrom this epoch that the renowned boldness of the present chancellor of\r\nGermany dates.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to study, in the confidential letters to Malvina, the\r\nstate of mind of M. de Bismarck during these years 1859-1860. At the\r\ncommencement of hostilities, and evidently despairing of seeing his\r\ngovernment adopt the line of conduct which he had not ceased to\r\nrecommend, he left his post, went to Moscow to visit the Kremlin, passed\r\nan agreeable day in a villa, so much more agreeable \"when one has the\r\nfeeling of being sheltered from the telegraph.\" The news of a great\r\nbattle fought in Lombardy (Magenta) caused him, nevertheless, to return\r\nto St. Petersburg. \"Perhaps there will be something for the diplomats to\r\ndo.\" At St. Petersburg, he learns of the strange desire at Berlin of\r\ninterceding for Austria, of mobilizing the federal armies, and from it\r\nhe conceived the greatest apprehensions for his country. He became ill.\r\nA very grave case of hepatitis endangered his life seriously. \"They\r\ncovered my body with innumerable cupping glasses large as saucers, with\r\nmustard poultices and quantities of blisters, and I was already half way\r\nto a better world when I began to convince my doctors that my nerves\r\nwere disordered by eight years of griefs and excitement without\r\nintermission (the eight years of Frankfort!), and that by continuing to\r\nweaken me, they would lead me into typhoid fever or imbecility. My good\r\nconstitution ended by conquering, thanks, above all, to several dozen\r\nbottles of good wine.\"\r\n\r\nHis good disposition did not the less remain dull and morose, and two\r\nmonths later he avowed that he would not have been sorry to have ended\r\nhis life then. Austria was vanquished, it is true; she had lost two\r\ngreat battles and one of the richest provinces; but Prussia had not\r\ndrawn any material, palpable advantage from this disaster of the\r\nHapsburg, and the cavalier of the Mark was not the man to cherish, like\r\nhis friend Alexander Mikhailovitch, a purely Platonic hatred. He\r\nconsoled himself, however, by the thought that the peace of Villafranca\r\nwas only a truce: \"to wish in the present state of affairs to seriously\r\nreconcile Austria with France, is to labor at the squaring of the\r\ncircle.\" \"I shall endeavor,\" he wrote at the approach of autumn, 1859,\r\n\"to cower in my bear-skin, and to bury myself in the snow; in the thaw\r\nof next May, I will see what remains of me and our affairs; if too\r\nlittle I shall definitely settle with politics.\" The following month of\r\nMay brought grave events; the annexation of Savoy became the signal for\r\nthe greatest distrust in Europe, of which we have spoken above: but the\r\ncabinet of Berlin persisted in its ancient course, and the prince regent\r\nhad, in July, an interview with the Emperor Francis Joseph at Toeplitz.\r\n\"I learn,\" wrote the representative of Prussia at the court of St.\r\nPetersburg with undisguised spite, \"that we have been shaved at\r\nToeplitz, splendidly shaved; we have let ourselves be taken in by the\r\nViennese good nature. And all that for nothing, not even the smallest\r\nplate of lentils.\" At last, in the month of October, after Castelfidardo\r\nand the conquest of the kingdom of Naples, the cabinet of Berlin\r\naddressed an energetic note to M. de Cavour, on the bearing of the House\r\nof Savoy on the Italian peninsula. The note established that \"it is\r\nsolely in the legal manner of reforms, and in respecting the existing\r\nrights, that a regular government is allowed to realize the legitimate\r\nwishes of nations,\" and closes by the following passage: \"Called to\r\nexpress ourselves on the acts and principles of the Sardinian\r\ngovernment, we can only deplore them profoundly, and we believe that we\r\nare fulfilling a rigorous duty by expressing in the most explicit and\r\nformal manner our disapprobation, both of those principles and of the\r\napplication which has been thought could be made of them.\" One can\r\nimagine what bad humor such _naivetes_ would cause to the future\r\ndestroyer of the _Bund_, to the future spoliator of Denmark, of Hanover,\r\nand so many other states. He again thought of leaving the career; he\r\nresolved in any case to \"cling to the situation of an observer,\" as\r\nregards the monstrous policy which was pursued at Berlin. He is\r\nperfectly astonished at the scandal which is caused on the banks of the\r\nSpree by the publication of the posthumous journal of M. de Varnhagen, a\r\njournal full of piquant revelations concerning the court of Prussia.\r\n\"Why be so indignant. Is it not taken from life? Varnhagen is vain and\r\n_mechant_, but who is not? Does it not all depend on the manner in which\r\nnature has ripened our lives? According to what we have suffered from\r\nthe bites of worms, from dampness, or from the sun, behold us sweet,\r\nsour, or rotten.\"\r\n\r\nThat did not hinder him, however, from carefully cultivating, during\r\nthese years 1859-1860, his relations with the political world of St.\r\nPetersburg from taking root there, and from attaching by a thousand ties\r\nthe fortune of his country to this friendship of Russia, of which he\r\nunderstood all the value. The position of the representatives of Prussia\r\nhas always been exceptional at St. Petersburg; thanks to the near\r\nrelationship of the two courts, they enjoyed in the winter palace a\r\nconfidence and intimacy which the envoys of other states scarcely ever\r\nobtained there. M. de Bismarck was able to add to these favorable\r\nconditions the influence of his personal merit, and the good reputation\r\nwhich he had acquired, in a Russian point of view, during his long\r\nsojourn at Frankfort. His former journeys in Courland had made him\r\nknown and liked by the German nobility of the Baltic Provinces, by the\r\nKeyserlingk, the Uxkuell, the Nolde, the Bruvern, etc., always so\r\ninfluential at court, in the chancellor's office, and in Russian\r\ndiplomacy. \"The first prophets of the future greatness of M. de\r\nBismarck,\" says an author very _au fait_ in the society of St.\r\nPetersburg, \"the first who predicted the providential mission which was\r\nreserved for him in Germany, were perhaps those barons of Courland and\r\nLivonia with whom the present chancellor of Germany had so often passed\r\nthe hunting season, shared their amusements, their banquets, and their\r\npolitical conversations.\"[32] The representative of Prussia at the court\r\nof St. Petersburg took care, however, not to give himself up too much to\r\nthis liking for the Courlanders and Livonians; he was careful to place\r\nin his affections, or at least in his demonstrations, the greatest part\r\nin Russian Russia, autochthonal Muscovy (_nastaiastchaia_). This\r\nenthusiasm for the customs and genius of the \"Scythians,\" this love for\r\nthe \"bear-skin and caviare,\" was it very sincere? We may perhaps doubt\r\nit; it is allowable to suppose that the man who, in the name of his\r\nGermanic superiority, has so often and boldly expressed his disdain for\r\nthe _Welches_ and Latins, feels at bottom a still greater contempt for\r\nthat Sclavic race which every good German makes rhyme with slave\r\n(_slave-esclave_).[33] However that may be, never did foreign\r\nambassador on the banks of the Neva have so much devotion as the\r\ncavalier of the Mark for the polar stars, or pushed as far as he did the\r\npassion of local color. He pushed it so far as to introduce into his\r\nhouse several little bears which (as formerly the foxes at Kniephof)\r\ncame, at the dinner hour, bounding into the dining hall, agreeably\r\nderanging the _convives_, licking the hand of their master, and \"biting\r\nthe calves of the servants' legs.\"[34] A worthy Nimrod, he never missed\r\nan expedition against the black king of the boreal forests; he did not\r\nfail to don on these occasions the Muscovite hunting costume, and the\r\nteam of horses _a la Russe_ has remained dear to him up to the present,\r\nand even in the streets of Berlin. He also affected to interest himself\r\ngreatly in the literary movement of the country; he had a Russian\r\nprofessor in his house, and he learned enough of it to be able to give\r\nhis orders to those people in their native idiom, even to delightfully\r\nsurprise one day the Emperor Alexander with some phrases pronounced in\r\nthe language of Pouchkine.\r\n\r\nThe Russians could not help giving a most cordial reception to a\r\ndiplomat who showed himself so taken with their usages and customs, with\r\ntheir pleasures and their \"peculiarities,\" and who, moreover, had the\r\nadvantage of succeeding to that good M. de Werther, whose reputation,\r\nneither there nor anywhere else, was exactly that of a too hilarious\r\ncharacter. On the contrary, they had never known on the banks of the\r\nNeva a Prussian as gay as this excellent M. de Bismarck, as good a\r\nfellow, as good a liver, having a loud laugh, coarse jests, and a witty\r\nspeech. He indulged in all sorts of pleasantries at the expense of the\r\n\"Philistines of the Spree,\" the \"old fogies of Potsdam,\" which gave him\r\nno small success: a minister plenipotentiary slandering his own\r\ngovernment, a grumbling, fault-finding diplomat in the very political\r\nsphere which he had the mission to represent and to second, that was an\r\noriginality which could be appreciated by a world always on the watch\r\nfor the _piquant_ and pleasing. He knew how to please the empress-mother\r\nHelen, whose influence at court was considerable, and whose warm support\r\nnever failed him in consequence, in the most grave moments of his career\r\nas minister. The emperor had conceived a great affection for him,\r\ninvited him regularly to his bear hunts, and did him the honor of\r\nadmitting him in his _cortege_ during his journeys to Warsaw and Breslau\r\nto meet the Prince Regent of Prussia. As for Prince Gortchakof, he\r\nenjoyed more than ever the society of his former colleague of Frankfort,\r\nand the _salons_ often repeated a malicious _mot, a mechant_ insinuation\r\nof which Austria generally had to bear the brunt, and the paternity of\r\nwhich they indifferently attributed first to one then to the other of\r\nthese two friends, grown inseparable, and whom spiteful intrigues\r\nnevertheless wished to separate! At the end of 1859, M. de Bismarck\r\nwrote in a confidential letter: \"Austria and its dear confederates are\r\nintriguing at Berlin to have me recalled from here: I am, however, very\r\namiable. God's will be done!\"\r\n\r\nAt Berlin, in the mean time, they began little by little to glide down a\r\ndeclivity, which would have caused Prussian politics to descend rapidly\r\nfrom the cloudy regions of the _new era_ upon that ground of realities\r\nand of action to which the tried friend of Alexander Mikhailovitch had\r\nso long invited them, and, curiously enough, it was precisely the\r\nmobilization of the Prussian army in 1859, the mobilization so condemned\r\nby M. de Bismarck, which was the immediate cause of this sudden revival\r\nfraught with incalculable consequences. It is fashionable now in France\r\nto represent the Prussian government as having meditated for half a\r\ncentury a war of revenge and conquest, slowly brightening their arms,\r\nand training a succession of generations for the decisive hour of\r\ncombat. There is nothing more false, however. Neither the government of\r\nFrederick William III., nor that of Frederick William IV. ever cherished\r\nwarlike projects, and even the humiliation of Olmuetz was not an\r\nincentive to the minister of war at Berlin. The two predecessors of\r\nWilliam I. only sacrificed to the military spirit just that which was\r\nnecessary to insure them a stand among the great Powers, to hold\r\nreviews, and to be able to speak of their faithful troops, and of their\r\nalways valiant swords; at bottom, they were not far from thinking like\r\nthe Grand Duke Constantine, the brother of the Emperor Nicholas, who one\r\nday said naively: \"I detest war, it spoils the armies!\" The swords of\r\nBluecher and Scharnhorst were sheathed since 1815; even the adoption of\r\nthe needle gun in 1847 was only an accident, rather a scientific\r\nexperiment; in 1848 and 1849, the Prussian troops did not shine with\r\nmarvelous _eclat_ in the war of the Duchies, and were even miserably\r\nheld in check by the undisciplined bands of the insurrection of Posen\r\nand Baden. The brother of the king, who had commanded the troops in\r\nBaden, was grievously moved at the sight which his soldiers then\r\npresented, and, having become regent of the kingdom (October, 1858), he\r\nimmediately turned his attention to military reform. Nevertheless it was\r\nonly the mobilization attempted during the Italian complications (in the\r\nsummer of 1859) which opened their eyes to all the grave inconveniences\r\nand incoherencies of the organization till then in force. Two superior\r\nmen, MM. de Moltke and de Roon, joined with the prince regent in\r\nremodeling the system from the very bottom. They displayed in it an\r\nintelligence, an energy, and a rapidity without equal in history; they\r\nknew how to profit by all the discoveries of science, and above all did\r\nnot let the great lesson escape them which a formidable civil war in\r\nNorth America soon taught, a war so rich in experiments and inventions\r\nof every kind. In spite of the obstacles which were thrown in their way\r\nwithout cessation from all sides, these two men, at the end of six\r\nyears, produced an armed force, entirely new, powerful, invincible; and\r\n\"the instrument,\" still rough and rudimentary in 1860, proved its ill\r\nomened \"perfection\" on the calamitous day of Sadowa! Not less erroneous\r\nis the opinion, very generally spread, however, that the Prussian people\r\nhad demanded of its government victories and aggrandizement; to refute\r\nthese perfectly gratuitous suppositions, it suffices to remember that\r\nthe different parliaments of Berlin did not cease to oppose military\r\nreform, and that they had on their side the almost unanimous voice of\r\nthe people. The ideas of German greatness, of German power, of the\r\nGerman mission, haunt the imagination of professors and authors much\r\nmore than that of the people; they were academic themes, choice morsels\r\nof rhetoric and opposition, still they are much more in vogue south of\r\nthe Main than north of this river,--and precisely there appears the\r\nastounding art of M. de Bismarck in having known how, to speak with\r\nMuenchausen, \"to condense mists into stones of size for a gigantic\r\nedifice,\" and to make of a dream of _savans_ a popular passion. The\r\nforce of will, the force of character, and in one word the genius, can\r\nstill, even in a century of democratic leveling and uniform mediocrity\r\nplay a _role_, of which our poor philosophy of history scarcely had a\r\nsuspicion, which drowns so skillfully all responsibility and initiative\r\nin the blind fatality of the \"masses,\" and, as a Teutonic proverb says,\r\ncannot distinguish the trees on account of looking at the forest. Take\r\nfrom the most recent history of Prussia three or four men who answer to\r\nthe names of William I., Moltke, Roon, and Bismarck, and the old\r\nBarbarossa would very probably up to the present time have continued his\r\nsecular sleep in the cave of the Kyffhaeuser.\r\n\r\nNature delights as well in analogies as in contrasts, and it is thus\r\nthat the antecedents of this prince regent, who to-day bears the name of\r\nWilliam I., Emperor of Germany, does not fail to present some similarity\r\nwith the past of the extraordinary man, who, at the destined hour, was\r\nto forge for him, _ferro et igne_, the imperial crown of Barbarossa. In\r\norder to be enlightened concerning these antecedents, it is necessary\r\nto turn to the posthumous \"Journal\" of M. Varnhagen von Ense,--the\r\nliberal, crabbed Dangeau, compromising in the highest degree, amiable as\r\na whole, of the court of Berlin,--the same \"Journal\" whose defense we\r\nhave seen M. de Bismarck undertake in a confidential letter, against the\r\nclamors which this publication had awakened in the capital of Prussia.\r\nThere is no doubt that Prince William made an energetic opposition to\r\nthe liberal desires which had signaled the _debuts_ of the reign of his\r\nbrother, King Frederick William IV. He had begun to work out at this\r\nepoch _memoirs for consulting_ which established his right of _veto_ in\r\nevery amendment of the fundamental laws of the state. The rumor of a\r\nformal protest in his name and in that of his descendants against every\r\nproject of constitution, found credit for a moment even in the heart of\r\nthe ministry; and under no conditions would he give his consent to the\r\nfeudal \"charter\" granted by his brother the 3d of February, 1847, except\r\non the express reservation that the States should not decide on the\r\nbudget, and should never occupy themselves with foreign affairs. And the\r\nunpopularity of the heir presumptive was great before the revolution of\r\n1848; during the fatal month of March of that year, it was against him\r\nespecially that the fury of the inhabitants of Berlin was let loose, who\r\nattributed to him (and wrongly) the order given to the troops to fire on\r\nthe people. He was then forced to leave the country on a \"mission\" to\r\nLondon, and the multitude did not forego the satisfaction of inscribing\r\non the palace of the fugitive the words of _national property_. Returned\r\nfrom England after the appeasement of the revolutionary effervescence,\r\nhe placed himself, in 1849, at the head of the troops to stifle in Baden\r\na ridiculous insurrection, and feigned \"important military operations,\"\r\nwhich kept him in the south of Germany, so as not to be present at the\r\nsolemn session of the 6th February, 1850, when King Frederick William\r\nIV. took his oath to the definite statute.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, however, especially towards the last years of the\r\ndisenchanted and morose reign of his brother, the Prince of Prussia\r\ncommenced to relax in his \"reactionary\" vigor, and especially made a\r\nsufficiently marked opposition to the \"pietist\" influences at the court\r\nof Potsdam. Affections and family considerations contributed also in\r\ncreating for the prince a peculiar situation. The esteem and tenderness\r\nwith which Frederick William IV. surrounded his wife did not always\r\nconsole her for the sterility with which she was afflicted, and the\r\nsight of a sister-in-law a happy mother of children destined for the\r\nthrone, probably to be called some day to occupy the throne, produced\r\ncoolness and irritation which the wife of the heir presumptive sharply\r\nresented. The Princess Augusta was not of a disposition to bear certain\r\nthrusts. Sprung from that House of Weimar which was always distinguished\r\nby its taste for arts and pleasure, she early had her own acquaintances,\r\nfriendships, and a bearing sufficiently different from the ordinary way\r\nof the court to resemble occasionally a divergence sought after with\r\nintention. The wishes of the Princess Augusta did not fail to finally\r\nexercise their influence on her husband, and the project, long nursed\r\nby the august couple, realized at last in 1857, of uniting their eldest\r\nson with the daughter of Queen Victoria, was regarded as the first\r\nconcession made to popular opinion. In fact, courtiers were not wanting\r\nat Potsdam, the terrible M. de Varnhagen tells us, who asked in their\r\nsoul and conscience if it were quite worthy of the House of Hohenzollern\r\nto ally itself by blood with a dynasty which was only half sovereign,\r\nand held in dependence by a house of commons! How the times and customs\r\nhave changed at this court of Potsdam which last year saw the heiress\r\npresumptive of the throne of Prussia and Germany, this same daughter of\r\nQueen Victoria, send affectionate telegrams to Doctor Strauss when\r\ndying, and render to the author of the \"Life of Jesus\" an homage _in\r\nextremis_ which transported with enthusiasm all the valiant cavaliers of\r\nthe _combat of civilization_!\r\n\r\nHabituated in a manner, and for several years already, to consider the\r\nbrother of the king as reconciled to modern ideas and favorable to the\r\ncause of progress, the nation was much less astonished than charmed to\r\nhear him, on his accepting the regency, use liberal and constitutional\r\nlanguage. A \"new era\" was to commence for Prussia; that word was almost\r\nofficially adopted to designate the change of system, and in a memorable\r\naddress, delivered on the 8th November, 1858, to the cabinet which he\r\nhad formed, the prince regent sketched the programme of a reparative\r\npolicy. He besought his councilors to bring about ameliorations in that\r\nwhich was arbitrary or contrary to the wants of the epoch. While\r\ndefending himself against a dangerous _laisser aller_ towards liberal\r\nideas, and expressing the will \"to courageously hinder that which has\r\nnot been promised,\" he did not the less proclaim the duty of keeping\r\nwith loyalty the contracted engagements, and of not hindering useful\r\nreforms. The address ended with the phrase become celebrated, and since\r\nthen so frequently cited, \"that Prussia should make '_moral conquests in\r\nGermany_.'\"\r\n\r\nThe harmony between the regent and the nation was not, however, of long\r\nduration; the relations were not slow in cooling and proceeding towards\r\na complete rupture, thanks especially to the projected reform of the\r\narmy. The prince had this reform at heart: the wants of 1859 had only\r\nconvinced him of the absolute urgency of a measure with which his mind\r\nhad been occupied for many years; but the deputies of the nation refused\r\nto follow him in this road, and opposed him tenaciously and firmly. They\r\ndid not understand the obstinacy which the prince displayed in a project\r\nwhich answered neither to the wants nor to the aspirations of the\r\ncountry, and they laughed at those who pretended that once in possession\r\nof his new \"instrument,\" the Hohenzollern, would _do great things_! They\r\nhad resisted judiciously, says a German author, the temptation of the\r\nparliament of Frankfort in 1849, and the provocation of Olmuetz in 1850;\r\nthey had let pass the opportunities which the wars of 1854 and 1859\r\npresented. The love of peace was absolute, there was a complete absence\r\nof ambition, they were perfectly resigned to the political situation\r\nwhich they occupied, and on the other side no one wished to admit that\r\na kingdom so peaceable could be menaced by neighbors. In such a state of\r\naffairs, every aggrandizement of the army drawing after it an increase\r\nof military and financial charges, already heavy enough for the\r\ncitizens, only seemed to the country an inconceivable caprice of its\r\nrulers.[35] The chambers refused the demanded credit; the government\r\nwent its way and continued its expenditures. The military question thus\r\nbecame a question of budget, and soon transformed itself into an\r\nirremediable constitutional conflict. Towards the end of 1861, no other\r\nremedy could be seen for the situation but a _coup d'etat_.\r\n\r\nNot less profound and irresistible was soon the change in the ideas of\r\nthe court of Potsdam, as regarded the external policy. In proportion as\r\nthe \"instrument\" perfected itself (and it perfected itself rapidly), one\r\nbegan to ask one's self about the most practical and fruitful employment\r\nfor it. One did not yet distinctly know what one wished, but one wished\r\nit with strength, with the strength which one drew from the battalions\r\nincreasing without cessation. Assuredly one always saw nothing but moral\r\nconquests in Germany, but one thought that a moral in action, aided\r\nsomewhat by needle guns, would give excellent results. The atmosphere\r\nwas charged with electricity and with the principles of nationality, and\r\nit was not only the professors and orators of the _National Verein_ who\r\nrecommended a \"united Germany with a Prussian point (_mit preussischer\r\nSpitze_).\" When, in the month of October, 1860, the envoy of Prussia,\r\nCount Brassier de Saint-Simon, read to Count Cavour the famous note of\r\nM. de Schleinitz against the Italian annexations, the president of the\r\nSardinian council listened in silence to the harangue, then expressed\r\nhis great regret at having displeased the government of Berlin on this\r\npoint, but declared that he consoled himself with the thought that\r\n\"Prussia would one day, thanks to Piedmont, profit by the example which\r\nhe had given it.\" In France, the journals of the democratic authority,\r\nthe devoted organs of the \"new right,\" did not cease to praise the\r\n\"Piedmontese mission\" of the House of Hohenzollern, and we have recalled\r\nabove the encouragements which Napoleon III. sent to Berlin after 1858.\r\nThe visit made by King William I.[36] to the Emperor of the French at\r\nCompiegne in the month of October, 1861, was in this respect a symptom\r\nmore significant, since none of the sovereigns of the North had till\r\nthen given this mark of courtesy to the choice of universal suffrage.\r\nStrange rumors began to spread concerning the alliance of the three\r\ncourts of the Tuileries, of St. Petersburg, and of Berlin, and they\r\ncontinued up to the month of March, 1863. Publications of mysterious\r\norigin, but which denoted a very specious knowledge of political\r\naffairs, spoke of the \"_great combination of states_ summing up in three\r\nraces,--the Roman, Germanic, and Sclavic,--to which corresponded three\r\ncentres of gravity, France, Prussia, and Russia, and of the definite\r\nestablishment of the peace of the world by means of a _triple alliance\r\nof universal monarchies_, in which their full expression (_Abschluss_)\r\nwould not only find the three principal races of the European system,\r\nbut also the three great Christian churches!\"[37] Lord Palmerston\r\ndeclared at this very epoch in parliament, with his Britannic\r\n_desinvolture_, \"that the situation seemed pregnant with at least half a\r\ndozen respectable wars;\" and in spite of the obscurity which still\r\ncovers the transactions of the years 1861-1862, it is not doubtful that\r\nNapoleon III. had then occasionally brought up in his scheming mind a\r\ncombination embracing at once the Orient and the Occident, a combination\r\nas vague as gigantic, and of which Prince Gortchakof prepared to profit\r\nwith his tried dexterity. Whatever these shadowy projects were, the\r\nHohenzollern had only to be satisfied with his sojourn at Compiegne,\r\nwhich he was to recall with a certain tenderness two years later in his\r\npolite reply to the invitation of the Congress. In October, 1861,\r\nNapoleon III., at Compiegne, probably made use of no other language than\r\nthat which he had used in 1858 at Berlin by the mediation of the Marquis\r\nPepoli, the fatidical language, \"on the great destinies which awaited\r\nPrussia in Germany, and which Germany expected from it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was thus that the difficulties from within and the facilities from\r\nwithout, the parliamentary conflicts in the interior and the political\r\nconstellations in the exterior united, towards the end of 1861, in\r\nequally urging the King of Prussia to energetic resolutions. A man of\r\nvigor was wanted for the vigorous actions which were projected, and the\r\nglances naturally fell on that grumbling diplomat at St. Petersburg,\r\nwho, for so many years already, had not ceased to criticise the\r\nministers of the _new era_, and to blame their conduct from without as\r\nwell as from within. In spite of the promise which he had given \"to\r\nconfine himself to his situation as an observer,\" M. de Bismarck had not\r\nfailed from time to time to give a thrust during those years 1860 and\r\n1861, and to repeat without cessation the precept of Strafford, the\r\nprecept of thorough (_a outrance!_). We see him during these years\r\nmaking very frequent journeys to Germany, seeking opportunities of\r\nmeeting the head of the state, of conversing with him on his ideas and\r\npresenting him various memoirs. In October, 1861, on the very eve of the\r\njourney to Compiegne, he submitted to him a little project, from which\r\nhe expected some success, and of which it is not so difficult in fact to\r\nimagine the tenor, when, above all, one takes care to study a\r\nconfidential letter written by him a few days before (18th September,\r\n1861), and directed entirely against a political programme which the\r\nconservative party in Prussia had published. In this curious letter he\r\nrises with violence against the _Bund_, \"the hot-bed of particularism,\"\r\ndemands \"a (_straffer_) firmer concentration of the armed forces of\r\nGermany, and a more natural configuration of the frontiers of the\r\nStates;\" but, above all, he puts his party on guard against _the\r\ndangerous fiction of a solidarity which would exist between all the\r\nconservative interests_. To triumph over this \"dangerous fiction\"\r\nstrongly rooted in certain minds, there was in truth the great\r\ndifficulty for the future minister of William I., his _omne tulit\r\npunctum_, for it is not so easy in this order of things to well\r\ndistinguish between reality and fiction; it is perhaps even perilous to\r\ndiscuss them, and a Retz would certainly have said of the conservative\r\ninterests what he so finely remarked of the right of peoples and of that\r\nof kings, \"that they never agree so well together as in silence.\" M. de\r\nBismarck was once more obliged to combat this \"fiction\" at Berlin as at\r\nSt. Petersburg, and if the mind as open as subtle of his friend\r\nAlexander Mikhailovitch allowed itself most often to be convinced\r\nwithout too much assistance, it was not the same with the Hohenzollern,\r\nwho, afterwards, on many an occasion, and in decisive moments, was to\r\nfeel the scruples, the shudders, and what Falstaff calls the \"tertian\r\nfevers of conscience.\"\r\n\r\nOn the return of William I. from Compiegne, the nomination of the\r\ncavalier of the Mark to the direction of affairs was already a\r\nwell-arranged and fixed matter. M. de Bismarck soon afterwards came to\r\nassist at the coronation of the king at Koenigsberg, and he only\r\nreturned to St. Petersburg to take leave definitely. At the beginning of\r\nthe month of May, 1862, he was again at Berlin; at the great military\r\nparade which was held in the capital on the occasion of the unveiling of\r\nthe statue of Count de Brandenburg (17th May), the political men, the\r\ndeputies, and the high functionaries of state looked upon him already as\r\nthe future \"Polignac\" of Prussia. The fears and the hopes which such a\r\nprovision excited were not, however, so soon to be realized, and the\r\nworld was somewhat perplexed in suddenly learning that M. de Bismarck\r\nwas to be appointed to the post in Paris. Did he still hesitate to take\r\ncharge of the burden of power, and did he in any case prefer to await\r\nthe result of the new elections which were to be held in Prussia? It is\r\nmore probable that before inaugurating his government of combat he\r\nwished to add some new conversations to those which were held at\r\nCompiegne, to take once again the measure of the man on whom a then\r\nuniversal belief made the destinies of Europe depend, and to prepare in\r\ngeneral the minds in France for the new policy which he was to\r\ninaugurate.\r\n\r\nHe only remained at Paris two months, during the two delightful months\r\nof May and June, but this short stay sufficed for him both to complete\r\nhis studies and to throw light on his religion. He had more than one\r\nconversation with the sovereign of France, whose profound ideas every\r\none exalted at this time, commented _ad infinitum_ on the smallest\r\nwords, admired even his silence, and whom he, however, the future\r\nconqueror of Sedan, did not hesitate in his confidential effusions to\r\ndefine even then as \"a great unrecognized incapacity.\" He saw also the\r\ninfluential men in the government, and in society, and strove to rally\r\nthem to his ideas and his projects. He did not conceal that his\r\nsovereign would not delay to appeal to him, and he exposed without a\r\n_detour_ the line of conduct which he would adopt on such an occurrence.\r\nWhat history will perhaps most admire in the present chancellor of\r\nGermany, will be the supreme art with which he sometimes handled the\r\ntruth: this man of genius has understood how to give to frankness\r\nitself all the political virtues of knavishness. Very artful and very\r\ncunning as to the means, he has nevertheless always been, as regards the\r\ngoal which he pursued, of a _desinvolture_, of an indiscretion without\r\nequal, and it was thus that he had at Paris in 1862 those astonishing\r\nand confidential conferences which only amused and which should have\r\nmade them reflect.[38]\r\n\r\nFrance,--said M. de Bismarck then and since, in 1862 as in 1864 and\r\n1865, every time that he conversed with any of the political men from\r\nthe banks of the Seine,--France would be wrong in taking umbrage at the\r\nincrease in Prussian influence, and, the case occurring, at its\r\nterritorial aggrandizement at the cost of the small States. Of what\r\nutility, of what help are then those small States, without a will,\r\nwithout strength, without an army? However far the designs and wants of\r\nPrussia could reach, they would necessarily stop at the Main; the line\r\nof the Main is its natural frontier; beyond that river, Austria will\r\nguard it, even its preponderance will increase, and there will thus\r\nalways be in Germany two powers balancing one another. Good order will\r\ngain, and certainly France will lose nothing there, it will even draw\r\nimmense advantages for its politics, for its movement in the world. In\r\nfact Prussia has an unfortunate, impossible configuration; _it wants a\r\nstomach_ on the side of Cassel and Nassau, _it has a dislocated\r\nshoulder_ on the side of Hanover, it is in the air, and this painful\r\nsituation necessarily condemns it to follow entirely the policy of\r\nVienna and St. Petersburg, to turn without rest in the orbit of the holy\r\nalliance. Better outlined, planted more solidly, having its members\r\ncomplete, it would be itself again, would have freedom of movements, the\r\n_freedom of alliances_, and what alliance more desirable for it than\r\nthat with the French Empire? More than one question pending to-day, and\r\nalmost unsolvable could have been settled then with perfect security:\r\nthat of Venice, that of the Orient,--who knows? perhaps even that of\r\nPoland! Finally, if the possible aggrandizements of Prussia seem to be\r\nexcessive, and to break the balance of strength what would prevent\r\nFrance from growing, from increasing itself in turn? Why should it not\r\ntake Belgium, and _destroy there a nest of demagogy_? The cabinet of\r\nBerlin would not oppose it; _suum cuique_, that is the antique and\r\nvenerable device of the Prussian monarchy.\r\n\r\nAll that said with liveliness, with spirit, with intelligence,\r\naccompanied by many an ingenious malicious remark, happy _mots_ on men\r\nand things, on that chamber of lords at Berlin, for instance, composed\r\nof respectable _old fogies_, and the chamber of deputies, equally\r\ncomposed of old fogies, but not respectable, and on an august personage,\r\nthe most respectable, but the greatest old fogy of all. M. de Bismarck\r\nhad at Paris during these two months almost the same success which had\r\naccompanied his three years' sojourn on the banks of the Neva. The\r\nimportant men, however, were careful not to overdo it; they readily\r\nrecognized in him all the qualities of a man of intellect, but they\r\ncould not make up their minds to consider him a _serious man_.\r\n\r\nIn the last days of the month of June, the new representative of Prussia\r\nat the court of the Tuileries undertook a pleasure trip in the south of\r\nFrance. He visited in turn Chambord, Bordeaux, Avignon, Luchon,\r\nToulouse, and made an excursion in the Pyrenees. \"The chateau of\r\nChambord,\" he wrote in a letter dated the 27th July, 1862, \"answers, by\r\nits isolation, to the destinies of its possessor. In the great\r\nporticoes, in the splendid halls, in which formerly the kings with their\r\nmistresses held their court and their hunts, the playthings of the child\r\nof the Duke of Bordeaux now form the only furniture. The _concierge_,\r\nwho served as my guide, took me for a legitimist, and _crushed_ a tear\r\nin showing me a little cannon of his prince. I paid him a franc more\r\nthan the tariff for this tear, although I feel but little desire to\r\nsubsidize Carlism.\" At Bordeaux he rejoiced in having been able to\r\n\"study _in the original_, and in the cellar of those great masters\r\ncalled Lafitte, Mouton, Pichon, Larose, Margaux, Branne, Armillac,\r\netc.,\" who are generally known in Germany only through bad translations.\r\nHe is delighted with his tour in the Pyrenees, but above all the Baths\r\nof Biarritz and St. Sebastian made him happy. He \"devotes himself there\r\nentirely to the sun and to the salt water,\" he forgets politics, and\r\nknows neither journals nor dispatches. It was at this moment (the end of\r\nSeptember, 1862) that he received from his sovereign the pressing call\r\nto go to Berlin. The elections had given a deplorable result, the\r\nimmense majority of the new chamber belonged to the _progressionists_.\r\nThey had not been able to decide at Berlin on the choice of the\r\npresident of the future ministry,--\"a cover for the government pot,\" as\r\nM. de Bismarck said; he was to fill those functions in the interim by\r\ntaking the portfolio of foreign affairs. Burned by the sun of the South\r\nand fortified by the waters of the Gulf, \"tanned and salted,\" the former\r\naspirant for the inspectorship of dikes in a district of the Mark,\r\nstarted for his country to fill there the first position in the state.\r\nHe only, so to speak, crossed Paris this time, but he remained there\r\nlong enough to leave a characteristic _mot_, which summed up his entire\r\nprogramme. \"Liberalism,\" said the designated chief of the Prussian\r\ngovernment, in taking leave in the bureaux of the Quai d'Orsay,\r\n\"liberalism is only nonsense which it is easy to bring to reason; but\r\nrevolution is a force, which it is necessary to know how to use.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] \"Austria is not a state, it is only a government.\"\r\n\r\n[27] As well as the Germans born or naturalized in Russia who encumbered\r\nthe different branches of the state service, and occupied in general a\r\nvery large and important position in the administration of the empire.\r\nOn his accession to the ministry, Alexander Mikhailovitch loudly\r\nsignified his intention of \"purging\" his department of all these\r\n\"intruders.\" Routine, however, and above all Sclavic idleness (which\r\nwillingly leaves to foreigners and to \"intruders\" all work demanding\r\nperseverance and application) were not slow in triumphing over the\r\nprinciple of nationality; the palingenesis of the minister, announced\r\nwith so much fuss, ended in a very insignificant change in the\r\n_personnel_ of the lower order, and the chancellor found among these\r\nGermans his two most devoted and capable aids: M. de Westmann, deceased\r\nlast May at Wiesbaden, and M. de Hamburger, quite recently made\r\nsecretary of state.\r\n\r\n[28] Letter of M. de Cavour to M. Castelli-Bianchi, _Storia\r\ndocumentata_, vol. viii. p. 622.\r\n\r\n[29] See, for this and all that follows concerning the relations of\r\nFrance and Russia in the years 1856-63, _Two Negotiations of\r\nContemporaneous Diplomacy; the Alliances since the Congress of Paris_,\r\nin the _Revue des deux Mondes_, of the 15th September, 1864.\r\n\r\n[30] It is true that, in a circular of the 27th May, 1859, the Russian\r\nvice-chancellor took care to give a commentary to his proposition, and\r\nto prove that the congress which he had planned looked to nothing\r\nchimerical. \"This congress,\" said he, \"_did not place any power in\r\npresence of the unknown_: its programme had been traced in advance. The\r\nfundamental idea which had presided at this combination, _prejudiced no\r\nessential interest_. _On one side, the state of territorial possession\r\nwas maintained_, and on the other there could come from the congress _a\r\nresult which had nothing excessive or unusual in the international\r\nrelations_.\" It would be well to re-read this remarkable circular, and\r\nto weigh every word of it. One will find in it the most curious and\r\nsubstantial criticism, made, so to speak, by anticipation, of the\r\ndifferent projects of the congress, those which later the Emperor\r\nNapoleon III. was to present to Europe, especially the eccentric project\r\nwhich surprised the world in the imperial speech of the 5th November,\r\n1863.\r\n\r\n[31] Massari, _Il Conte Cavour_, p. 268.\r\n\r\n[32] _Aus der Petersburger Gesellschaft_, vol. ii. p. 90.\r\n\r\n[33] In 1862, at the moment of definitely leaving his post at St.\r\nPetersburg, M. de Bismarck received the visit of a colleague, a foreign\r\ndiplomat. They were speaking of Russia, and the future chancellor of\r\nGermany said, among other things, \"I am in the habit, when leaving a\r\ncountry where I have lived long, to consecrate to it one of my watch\r\ncharms, on which I have engraved the final impression which it has left\r\nme; do you wish to know the impression which I carry from St.\r\nPetersburg?\" And he showed to the puzzled diplomat a little charm on\r\nwhich these words were engraved: \"_Russia is nothingness!_\"\r\n\r\n[34] M. de Bismarck has since presented these quadrupeds to the\r\nzoological garden of the former free city of Frankfort.\r\n\r\n[35] Constantin Roessler, _Graf Bismarck und die deutsche Nation_,\r\nBerlin, 1871.\r\n\r\n[36] Frederick William IV. having died the 2d January, 1861, the prince\r\nregent took from that day the name William I.\r\n\r\n[37] See the remarkable pamphlet entitled _Europa's Cabinete und\r\nAllianzen_, Leipzig, 1862. It is the work of a Russian diplomat,\r\ncelebrated in political literature, the same whose book on the\r\n_Pentarchie_ had such a loud echo under the monarchy of July.\r\n\r\n[38] See in the _Revue des deux Mondes_ of the 1st October, 1868, _Les\r\nPreliminaires de Sadowa_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nUNITED ACTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nHowever great one wishes to make the share of genius in the work of M.\r\nde Bismarck, one cannot deny that a great part also comes from the\r\nunforeseen, from an extraordinary combination of circumstances, in one\r\nword, from that goddess Fortune whom the _minnesinger_ of the Middle\r\nAges did not cease to praise in song, whom Dante himself did not fail to\r\nextol in the immortal verses, \"The course always luminous like a star in\r\nheaven, and the decree always hidden like a serpent in the grass.\"\r\nWithout doubt, one can admire the extreme audacity with which the\r\npresent chancellor of Germany has so often let fall from his hand the\r\n_iron dice of destiny_; one can even, to speak with the witty Abbe\r\nGaliani, suspect more than one cogged one in such a persistent \"_pair\r\nroyal of six_.\" It is not less true that in his long career as player,\r\nthe president of the council at Berlin has occasionally met, in the most\r\ndecisive moments, such marvelous luck as no human wisdom could foresee,\r\nthat no political subtlety could prepare, and in which the hardy\r\n_punter_ only had the merit, very considerable it is true, of not\r\nletting the vein exhaust itself or of using up the series. One of these\r\nmagnificent strokes of luck, one of these perfectly prodigious events\r\nfell to the lot of William I. on his accession to power, in the month\r\nof January, 1863. This event laid the first foundations of his future\r\ngreatness, it became the mainspring of his action in Europe, the\r\nArchimedean point from whence afterwards he raised up a world of daring\r\nprojects, and it is necessary to bear it well in mind.\r\n\r\nThe ideal which M. de Bismarck had before him in taking into his hands\r\nthe reins of state, was the aggrandizement, \"the rounding off\" of the\r\nmonarchy of Frederick II. He had made the premature avowal of it at the\r\ntime of his mission to Paris; he also declared it very frankly in the\r\nfirst sitting of the commission of the chamber at Berlin, scarcely a\r\nweek after having been made minister (29th September, 1862). He\r\ncertainly did not foresee in what measure he should realize this ideal,\r\nto what limits he could extend in Germany conquests which should cease\r\nto be \"moral;\" but he clearly foresaw that in this attempt he would find\r\na resolute adversary in Austria, and he made up his mind to it.[39] The\r\nonly question which engrossed him was the attitude which the other great\r\nPowers of Europe would maintain in view of certain events. Among them,\r\nhe did not count England; with his rare political sagacity, he had early\r\nappreciated to what state of domestication and mildness that excellent\r\nschool of Manchester had reduced the leopard formerly so fierce, and his\r\nconviction that proud Albion would not think of evil, and would even\r\nallow itself to be disgraced a little, was soon to be fully justified in\r\nthe piteous campaign of Denmark. \"England is far from entering into my\r\ncalculations,\" he said in 1862, in a familiar conversation, \"and do you\r\nknow when I ceased to count her? From the day when she renounced of her\r\nfree will the Ionian Islands; a Power which ceases to take and begins to\r\nsurrender is a used-up Power.\" France and Russia remained, and it was\r\nnot forbidden to think that, skillfully managed, these two states would\r\nfavor to a certain degree the Prussian designs, or at least would not\r\noppose them too strongly. On the banks of the Neva old grudges existed,\r\nsprung from the war of the Orient, imperfectly gratified by the war of\r\nLombardy; the old relations between the Gottorp and the Hohenzollern,\r\nalways cordial, had become more intimate than ever, thanks to the recent\r\nefforts of M. de Bismarck during his sojourn at St. Petersburg; finally,\r\nthere was his friend Alexander Mikhailovitch, former colleague of\r\nFrankfort, so prepossessed in favor of the new minister of King William\r\nI., so well united with him in the hatred against Austria, and also so\r\nwell warned against the \"dangerous fiction\" of a solidarity which should\r\nexist between all the conservative interests. On the banks of the Seine,\r\nin the Tuileries, still so much dreaded, there reigned a sovereign who,\r\nby dint of studying the general good of humanity, lost more and more the\r\nconsideration of the French state, and whose vague vacillating regard it\r\nwas not very difficult to dazzle, especially when one mirrored before\r\nhim the \"new right\" and the affranchisement of Venice. Moreover, since\r\nthe congress of Paris, there was established between the two cabinets\r\nof the Tuileries and St. Petersburg a \"cordiality\" which increased from\r\nday to day, and in which Prussia began to have a very large share: was\r\nthere not ground to hope for the latter, in the enterprise which it\r\nmeditated, a generous cooperation or at least a cordial neutrality of\r\nthe two Powers so friendly to one another, and so unsympathetic towards\r\nthe House of Hapsburg?\r\n\r\nAnd yet such an enterprise was so profoundly contrary to the well\r\nunderstood interests and to the firmly rooted traditions of Russia as\r\nwell as of France, the substitution in the centre of Europe of a great\r\nmilitary and conquering monarchy in the place of a pacific\r\nconfederation, and one \"purely defensive,\" presented such manifest\r\ninconveniences, even such evident dangers for the security and\r\nequilibrium of the world, that the president of the council at Berlin\r\ncould scarcely entertain as regards this matter too flattering hopes.\r\nThe bitter resentments at the winter palace, and the sweet dreams at the\r\npalace of the Tuileries, could not long prevail against the reality of\r\ngeography and the brutality of facts. Unless at Paris and St. Petersburg\r\nthere was a complete want of statesmen with a little political\r\ndiscernment in their minds, a little national history in their souls,\r\none might wager that the two governments, Russian and French, would not\r\nremain indifferent spectators to such a formidable overturning in the\r\nbalance of the Continent. From well-wishing, their neutrality would not\r\ndelay in becoming by degrees watchful and alarmed, would even change to\r\ndeclared hostility, as the Prussian successes became marked, and it was\r\nthis cordiality between the two empires, apparently so favorable to\r\nPrussia, which would then form another peril, facilitating prompt and\r\ndecisive action against the Hohenzollern. Such being the situation of\r\nEurope at the beginning of the year 1863, what the new minister of\r\nWilliam I. could wish for in his boldest combinations, invoke in his\r\nmost golden dreams, was some unforeseen incident, some extraordinary\r\nevent which should embroil in an irremediable manner the two emperors\r\nAlexander II. and Napoleon III., which should revive at St. Petersburg\r\nall the ancient rancor towards Vienna, which should permit Prussia to\r\nattach Russia to itself by ties stronger, more indissoluble, while\r\npreserving its necessary good relations with the cabinet of the\r\nTuileries. A chimera! the boldest constructor of hypotheses would have\r\ncertainly cried, before such demands; a problem of algebra and political\r\nalchemy unworthy of occupying a mind however frivolous! Well! chance,\r\nthat providence of the fortunate of earth, did not delay to cause an\r\nevent which realized to the profit of M. de Bismarck all the conditions\r\nof the indicated problem, which filled all the points of such a\r\nfantastic programme. \"If Italy did not exist, it would be necessary to\r\ninvent it,\" the president of the council at Berlin said later in 1865;\r\nin the month of January, 1863, he certainly did not think otherwise\r\nconcerning the Polish questions.\r\n\r\nHistory offers few examples of a fall so rapid, so humiliating, from the\r\nsublime to the odious and to the perverse, than was presented on the\r\nbanks of the Vistula by that lamentable drama which, after two years of\r\nbitter revolutions, reached its final catastrophe in this month of\r\nJanuary, 1863, as if to celebrate the joyful accession of M. de Bismarck\r\nto power. Certainly there was something very poetic and very exalted in\r\nthose first manifestations from Warsaw, when a people so long, so\r\ncruelly tried, knelt one day before the castle of the lieutenant of the\r\nking in mute complaint, holding only the image of Christ, and demanding\r\nonly \"its God and its country!\" The lieutenant of the king, who was no\r\nother than the old hero of Sebastopol, Prince Michael Gortchakof, had a\r\nhorror of a conflict so unequal, so strange; he appealed to St.\r\nPetersburg, and,--miracle of divine pity,--from that place, whence for\r\nthirty years only orders of blood and punishment had gone forth, there\r\ncame this time a word of clemency and reparation. A generous spirit then\r\nanimated the governing and intelligent classes in Russia, they were\r\nunder the influence of ideas of reform and emancipation, they desired\r\nthe esteem of Europe, the friendship of France, and they had the very\r\nsincere desire to be reconciled with Poland. The Emperor Alexander II.\r\nsent his brother to Warsaw; a patriot of rare vigor of mind and of\r\ncharacter took in hand the civil government; the instruction, the\r\njustice, the administration received a national impress; a modest but\r\ncertain autonomy was assured for the country. The precepts of the most\r\ncommon wisdom, the instinct of preservation, the terrible lessons of the\r\npast, should have all counseled the Poles to profit by this good\r\ndisposition of their sovereign, to put to proof the granted\r\ninstitutions, to accept with _empressement_ the hand stretched out to\r\nthem. In fact everything counseled them thus, but they bent to the\r\nanathema which the Holy Scriptures had long before pronounced against\r\nevery kingdom which allows itself to be guided by women and children.\r\nThe women and the youth of the schools resolved to continue to multiply\r\nthe manifestations which had succeeded so well, and which, in ceasing to\r\nbe spontaneous, became theatrical and sacrilegious. The European\r\ndemagogy hastened to transport to a ground so overturned its emblems,\r\nits words of disorder, its secret societies, and its _instrumenta\r\nregni_; from afar, from the midst of the Palais Royal came\r\nrecommendations \"to leave the Catholic mummeries and to make\r\nbarricades.\" The great conservative party showed itself cowardly there\r\nas elsewhere, as everywhere, as always; and, in wishing to save its\r\npopularity, it lost a whole population. One made a void around the\r\nbrother of the emperor, around the patriotic minister, and this void was\r\nnot slow in being filled by horror, by terror and crime. The government\r\nstruggled in vain against a shadowy organization which enveloped it on\r\nall sides; it took contradictory and violent measures. The demagogy\r\ngained its cause; it succeeded in throwing into a powerless, foolish\r\nrevolt an unhappy people which for a century seemed to have imposed on\r\nitself the task of astonishing the world by periodical resurrections,\r\nand of disheartening it at the same time by suicides, alas, not less\r\nperiodical!\r\n\r\nThis criminal folly of a nation could only be equaled by the\r\nheedlessness not less culpable with which Europe encouraged and fanned\r\nit. Europe, which had not dared to touch the Polish question during the\r\nwar of the Crimea, thought it opportune to sympathize, to trifle with it\r\nin this moment, the most ill-timed and the most desperate! Lord John\r\nRussell was the first to enter the lists. In 1861 he wrote the famous\r\ndespatch to Sir J. Hudson, and persuaded himself and England that by it\r\nhe had delivered Italy. The year afterwards, in the celebrated dispatch\r\nof Gotha, he conceived for Denmark a most original constitution in four\r\nparts, with four parliaments, and thus gave the signal for the\r\ndismemberment of the Scandinavian monarchy. This time he believed that\r\nhe ought to recommend parliamentary institutions for Poland; and to the\r\nobservation of the Russian ambassador that it would be difficult for the\r\nczar to favor on this point his Polish subjects over his own national\r\nones, he naively asked why he would not extend the same benefit to all\r\nthe Russias?[40] Count Rechberg, the fatal minister who then directed\r\nthe external affairs at Vienna, experienced on his part the desire of\r\nshowing himself compassionate; he accorded himself the malicious and\r\nvery costly pleasure of paying the cabinet of St. Petersburg, in Polish\r\ncoin, for the sympathies which this latter had shown for the Italian\r\ncause. As if Austria had not already suffered enough from the imaginary\r\ngrievances of the Muscovites as regards the pretended \"treason\" during\r\nthe war of the Crimea, it desired to give it very legitimate grievances\r\nby a very real \"connivance\"[41] in Gallicia; Gallicia became, in fact,\r\nthe refuge, the depot of arms, and the place of revictualing for the\r\ninsurgents of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt is just to acknowledge that the French government had long hesitated\r\nbefore starting on a way so perilous. From the first period of the\r\nPolish agitation, a note published in the \"Moniteur\" of the 23d April,\r\n1861, had put the press and public opinion on guard against \"the\r\nsupposition that the government of the emperor encouraged hopes which it\r\ncould not satisfy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The generous ideas of the czar,\" continued the note of the \"Moniteur,\"\r\n\"are a certain gauge of his desire of realizing the ameliorations of\r\nwhich the state of Poland admits, and we should wish that it be not\r\nhindered by irritating manifestations.\" The French government persevered\r\nin this sensible and perfectly amicable attitude towards the czar during\r\nthe years 1861 and 1862, in spite of the interest which the Parisian\r\npress did not cease to take in the \"dramatic\" events of Warsaw, in spite\r\nof several animated debates which were held in the English parliament,\r\nand which were rather addressed to France than to Russia. The Britannic\r\nstatesmen in fact had not thought it useless during those two years 1861\r\nand 1862 to slightly embarrass the cabinet of the Tuileries in its very\r\npronounced liking for the Russian alliance by the frequent and\r\nsympathetic evocation of the name of Poland. Lord Palmerston\r\nespecially, in a very _witty_ speech on the 4th April 1862, exalted the\r\nPoles, praised their \"indomitable, inextinguishable, inexhaustible\"\r\npatriotism, while not neglecting to recall to them the cruel deceptions\r\nwhich a French emperor had already caused them \"at another epoch.\"\r\nNapoleon III. always resisted the unguarded emotions at home, as well as\r\nthe selfish excitements from abroad. Even on the 5th February, after the\r\nbreaking out of the fatal revolt, M. Billault, the minister-orator in\r\nthe midst of the legislative body, harshly qualified the Polish\r\ninsurrection as the work of \"revolutionary passions,\" and insisted with\r\nforce on the danger of \"useless words and vain protestations;\" but the\r\nnoisy language of the English ministers, the enigmatical attitude of\r\nAustria, and lastly the military convention which M. de Bismarck\r\nconcluded with Russia (8th February, 1863), and which he made public,\r\nended by involving him. After having done so much for seven years to\r\ngain the Russian \"cordiality,\" after having sacrificed to it almost all\r\nthe fruits of the war of the Orient, Napoleon III. overturned brusquely\r\na scaffolding so laboriously constructed, and prepared to organize\r\nagainst the government of the czar a _great European remonstrance_ of\r\nwhich the first and terrible effect was naturally to increase in Poland\r\nthe torrent of blood and tears. The general cry at Warsaw was then that\r\nthe insurrection must last to justify the intervention of Europe,[42]\r\nthat it was necessary to let as much Polish blood flow as sympathetic\r\nink flowed from the chancellors' offices. One knows the deplorable\r\nissue of this great diplomatic campaign, which lasted nine months, and\r\nonly served to demonstrate the profound disagreement between the Powers\r\nof the East. The foreign intermeddling wounded the pride of Russia, and\r\nimpelled it to undertake against the Polish nationality a work of\r\ngeneral, methodical, implacable extermination, and one from which it has\r\nnever since desisted. However frivolous the diplomatic tourney of the\r\nOccidental Powers in favor of Poland was, the Russians did not the less\r\nthink that they had been menaced with a moment of extreme peril, and\r\nthat they had only escaped, thanks to the firmness of their \"national\"\r\nminister, to his patriotic courage, to his acute, dignified, and\r\nvigorous dispatches. Certainly the minister is, humanly speaking, very\r\nexcusable for not having protested against a belief so flattering: he\r\nlet it go, he let it be said that he had repulsed a new invasion and had\r\n\"overcome Europe:\" _scripsit et salvavit!_ He was made chancellor, he\r\nreceived enthusiastic ovations from his compatriots, he became the idol\r\nof the nation by the side of M. Katkof and the sanguinary Mouravief.\r\nDuring a whole year he did not attend a single banquet in the most\r\nobscure corner of Russia without these three names \"saviors and blessed\"\r\nbeing celebrated by speeches, feted in toasts, congratulated by\r\ntelegrams, and, whatever repugnance the descendant of the Rourik and the\r\nfoster child of the classical humanities must have felt in his spiritual\r\ntribunal at being thus constantly coupled with a fierce journalist and\r\nwith a frightful executioner, he made the sacrifice to his love for his\r\ncountry and for popularity. In his well meaning ardor to receive the\r\nhomage which came to him from all sides, he even so far forgot himself\r\none day as to thank with a stereotyped smile the German nobility of the\r\nBaltic provinces for a diploma as honorary citizen which had been sent\r\nhim, and the national party reproached him with a certain bitterness for\r\nthe \"culpable delight\" to which he gave way on this occasion. Alexander\r\nMikhailovitch had all the honors of the sad campaign of 1863; the\r\nprofits of it went to another, to the former colleague of Frankfort, to\r\nthe president of the council at Berlin, who was to find in it a solid\r\nand assured basis for all the great strategy in the future. We will show\r\nhow the balance sheet of the situation, which created, towards the end\r\nof 1863, the _great European remonstrance_ in the affairs of Poland,\r\npresented itself to the interests and the hopes of Prussia: the happy\r\nquiet of England was duly established; France and Russia were from this\r\ntime forward embroiled, and in an irreparable manner; the resentment\r\nagainst Austria had grown stronger than ever at St. Petersburg, and also\r\nthe Prussian minister had more than ever the right of counting on the\r\ngrateful friendship, on the devotion to any extent, of Prince\r\nGortchakof; lastly, it was not so difficult to foresee that after his\r\nsignal check of Warsaw the Caesar of the new right would hasten to cast\r\nhis glances on Venice, to wish to \"do something for Italy,\" and would\r\ntherefore favor more benevolently \"a young power of the North\" in its\r\nenterprises against the Hapsburg, to whom the Napoleonic ideology had\r\nlong since assigned \"a great destiny in Germany.\"\r\n\r\nIt would, however, do too much honor to human genius to credit M. de\r\nBismarck with a clear and precise view at first sight of all the\r\nfavorable, even prodigious consequences, which the fatal insurrection in\r\nPoland was to bring him. Many circumstances seemed rather to indicate\r\nthat, especially in the beginning, the Prussian minister only groped and\r\nsought his way in unfrequented paths. A curious matter, and which\r\nperhaps might give cause for reflection even to-day, M. de Bismarck, who\r\nhad certainly studied Russia well, who had lived there for several\r\nyears, and had just left it, seems to have very seriously doubted the\r\nstrength of this empire in 1863, and doubted it so far that he did not\r\neven think it capable of conquering in that miserable affray with the\r\nunhappy Polish youth! He expressed his fears on this point before the\r\nplenipotentiaries of England and Austria,[43] and went so far one day as\r\nto become very confidential on this subject to the vice-president of the\r\nPrussian chamber, M. Behrend. \"This question,\" said the minister of\r\nWilliam I., towards the middle of the month of February, \"can be solved\r\nin two ways: it is either necessary to stifle the insurrection promptly\r\nin concert with Russia, and to come before the Eastern Powers with an\r\naccomplished fact, or one can let the situation develop and aggravate\r\nitself; wait till the Russians are driven from the kingdom, or reduced\r\nto invoke aid, and then _proceed boldly and occupy the kingdom for\r\nPrussia_; at the end of three years all of it will be Germanized.... But\r\nthat is a ball-room plan which you propose to me, cried out the\r\nstupefied vice-president (the conversation took place at a court ball).\r\nNo, was the answer: I am speaking seriously of serious things. The\r\nRussians are tired of the kingdom, the Emperor Alexander himself told me\r\nat St. Petersburg.\"[44] This thought of recovering the line of the\r\nVistula, lost since Jena, haunted more than once the mind of M. de\r\nBismarck during the year 1863: let it be well understood, he did not\r\nwish to obtain the \"rectification of the frontier\" except with the\r\nconsent of the Emperor Alexander II., but he did not neglect the means\r\nwhich could force to a slight extent such a solution. One of the most\r\nintimate confidants of the minister, and now the representative of\r\nGermany to the court of King Victor Emmanuel, M. de Keudell, proprietor\r\nof vast domains in the kingdom of Poland, profited by his relations with\r\nthe prominent men of the unhappy country to advise them on several\r\noccasions to look to Berlin for help, to demand there, for instance, a\r\n_temporary_ Prussian occupation which would render them not liable to\r\nRussian duty! In looking carefully into the history of this fatal\r\ninsurrection, one will perhaps find there other Prussian agents, much\r\nmore obscure, but also much more compromising than M. de Keudell. Did\r\nthe president of the council at Berlin seriously hope to obtain so much\r\nfrom the \"lassitude\" of the Emperor Alexander and the friendship of the\r\nPrince Gortchakof?\r\n\r\nWhatever these hopes or _arriere-pensees_ were, M. de Bismarck used a\r\nrestless ardor in making evident from the time of his _debut_ his\r\nabsolute solidarity with the Russian vice-chancellor as opposed to the\r\nEast. He offered him a military convention in the most spontaneous, even\r\nimpetuous manner; he undertook his defense on every occasion, and did\r\nnot cease to aid him faithfully, ardently, in passages of diplomatic\r\narms with the cabinets of England, France, and Austria, experiencing\r\nwith pleasure the first fire of the notes of M. Drouyn de Lhuys,\r\nsupporting with joy the universal clamors of the press, responding with\r\nhaughtiness to the interpellations of his parliament. The great men of\r\nthe progressionist party understood nothing, on this occasion as on so\r\nmany others, of the policy of their \"Polignac;\" they thought it\r\ninopportune, perilous, and demanded where the German interest was in all\r\nthat? To which the Polignac replied one day in the chamber with this\r\nveiled and yet very significant image, that, \"Placed before the\r\nchess-board of diplomacy, _the profane spectator_ believes the game\r\nended at every new piece that he sees advanced, and can even fall into\r\nthe illusion that the player is changing his objective point.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly M. de Bismarck did not change his objective point at all, and\r\nalways had in mind the aggrandizement of Prussia; but it is evident that\r\nup to the autumn of that year, 1863, he had no well-fixed plan; he\r\n\"moved his pieces\" in different directions, and awaited the inspiration\r\nof chance to know from what side he should strike \"the blow,\"--from the\r\nMain, from the Vistula, or from the Elbe? He had aimed at Cassel for a\r\nmoment, and had thrown himself with some bluster into the constitutional\r\nconflict of this country with the elector; he had even given on this\r\noccasion the pleasing spectacle of a minister intervening in a\r\nneighboring state to force the prince there to the most strict\r\nobservation of parliamentary rule, while himself governing without\r\nregard for the constitution, and by means of taxes levied contrary to\r\nthe vote of the chamber. Without speaking of the adventurous projects\r\nwhich were cherished at Berlin touching a possible rectification of\r\nfrontier from the side of the Vistula, on the banks of the Elbe there\r\nwas the old, everlasting question of the Duchies, a question hushed up\r\nsince the treaty of London, but reawakened anew in 1859 in consequence\r\nof the events in Italy, and become even more dangerous since a famous\r\ndispatch, mortal for Denmark, which Lord John Russell, in a moment of\r\ninconceivable thoughtlessness, had issued from Gotha, the 24th\r\nSeptember, 1862,--precisely the day of M. de Bismarck's accession to the\r\nministry! The secondary States, the Diet of Frankfort, and M. de\r\nRechberg himself, had become very ardent, and vied with each other in\r\nGerman patriotism in this cause of Schleswig-Holstein, a cause which at\r\nbottom they thought to be chimerical, and by which they only wished to\r\nembarrass Prussia, to convince it of \"national lukewarmness.\" The\r\ntemptation became great to take at their word the secondary States, the\r\nDiet of Frankfort, even Austria, to unite them against Denmark in a war\r\nwhich would give Prussia the magnificent port of Kiel, and would permit\r\nit, moreover, to try the \"instrument\" which King William I. \"had been\r\nperfecting\" for four years, ... provided that the war could be\r\n_localized_, and that the European Powers would not put themselves in\r\nthe way as in 1848! The president of the council at Berlin did not\r\nentirely despair of succeeding by patient and wise manoeuvres. He\r\ncounted on the friendship of Prince Gortchakof, on different political\r\nconstellations, finally on the strange confusion, and, to speak with\r\nMontaigne, on \"the great hubbub of brains\" which certain principles of\r\nthe new right and of nationality had introduced into each chancellor's\r\noffice of the Continent. He said to himself occasionally, that in this\r\ngrave enterprise he would certainly have for a determined adversary only\r\nthat good Lord Russell, who, after his fatal dispatch of Gotha, had\r\nagain altered his mind, had even constituted himself the advocate, the\r\nprotector, and the _mentor_ of the unfortunate government of Copenhagen:\r\nsuch a partner did not greatly frighten the bold cavalier of the Mark.\r\n\r\nAt first, however, and as long as the negotiations on Poland lasted, the\r\ncavalier of the Mark thought that he ought to use prudence and simulate\r\nto the cabinet of Saint James extreme indifference on the subject of\r\nthis \"vexatious\" affair of the Duchies. Nothing is more instructive than\r\nto follow in the state papers, as well as in the documents communicated\r\nto the _Rigsraad_, the intimate and almost daily effusions by which M.\r\nde Bismarck had been able to persuade, up to the last hour, not only\r\nLord Russell and his envoy Sir A. Buchanan, but also M. de Quade, the\r\nDanish minister at the court of Berlin, that this question of\r\nSchleswig-Holstein was a _hobby_ of the secondary States and of Austria,\r\nthat Prussia was far from sharing those Teutonic effervescences and\r\nconcupiscences, and that it would do all that lay in its power to calm,\r\nto allay them. The 14th October, 1863, two weeks after the Diet of\r\nFrankfort had decreed the federal execution in Holstein, M. de Bismarck\r\nstipulated in a conversation with the envoy of Great Britain, Sir A.\r\nBuchanan, to _prevent this execution_, if Denmark accepted the English\r\nmediation.[45] Denmark accepted it, and Lord Russell could at last\r\nbreathe. Moreover, on the 6th November, 1863, M. Quade wrote from Berlin\r\nto his government: \"The first minister of Prussia, be it on account of\r\nhis personal views, or on account of the attitude taken by England, has\r\nput the affair in a position that _exceeds greatly all that one could\r\nhave hoped_. I am not certain whether the question is regarded at Vienna\r\nwith the same clearness and the same warmth (warmth for the interests of\r\nDenmark!) as it is here.\" Thus Sir A. Buchanan and M. Quade still judged\r\nthe situation on the 6th November. But they were not slow in being\r\nbrusquely awakened from their illusions by a despairing dispatch from\r\nthe principal secretary of state, dated the 9th November, and couched in\r\nthese terms: \"If the information which reaches me is exact, M. de\r\nBismarck no longer offers any objection (_n'oppose plus aucune\r\nobjection_) to the federal execution in Holstein; the government of her\r\nmajesty can only leave to Germany the responsibility of exposing Europe\r\nto a general war.\" The information was unfortunately only too correct,\r\nand the vexations of the good Johnny commenced.\r\n\r\nTwo important facts had taken place in the interval of three weeks which\r\nhad passed since the conversation of the 14th October; in this interval,\r\nthe cabinet of Saint James had abandoned to the Russian government the\r\naffairs of Poland, and the Emperor Napoleon III. had launched into the\r\nworld a fantastic project of a congress _for the arrangement of all the\r\npending questions_! Charmed in the highest degree with the aid which M.\r\nde Bismarck lent him in this month of October in the Danish\r\ndifficulties, the principal secretary of state had at last decided to\r\nmake him the sacrifice so often demanded, of the Polish question, even\r\nto recall by telegraph a courier, bearer of a very comminatory note\r\naddressed to the government at St. Petersburg, and to replace this\r\nmissive by a most humble dispatch, which renounced all ulterior\r\ncontroversy on this subject (20th October).[46] On his part, the\r\nEmperor of the French, kept informed of these intrigues, profoundly\r\nvexed at this abandonment by England, and not being able to resolve to\r\naccept his check, nor, above all, to make the avowal of it without\r\nceremony before the legislative body, had thought (5th November) of that\r\ncall for a general congress which only increased the uneasiness of\r\nEurope, and especially inspired the chief of the foreign office with\r\nunspeakable fears. Not content with replying to the invitation of the\r\ncabinet of the Tuileries by a most bitter and offensive note, Lord John\r\nRussell bestirred himself to preserve the foreign courts from the\r\ncontagion of the French idea; he almost entirely lost from view the\r\ndangers of Denmark, and only cared to combat the project of Napoleon\r\nIII., a project assuredly without vitality, and which, in order to die\r\nits natural death, had no need of such a display of British forces. The\r\npresident of the Prussian council thought that the moment had come to\r\nbegin his game. The last shadow of an Eastern understanding disappeared;\r\nonly the alliance of Russia and Prussia remained intact, unshaken, in\r\nthe midst of the general disorder of the cabinets. No European concerted\r\naction for the protection of Denmark was to be feared. M. de Bismarck\r\ncould now \"no longer have any objection\" to the federal execution in\r\nHolstein; and soon an unhoped-for event, one of those magnificent\r\nstrokes of fortune, such as the minister of William I. has so often met\r\nwith in his marvelous career, proved that he was decidedly in luck. The\r\nsudden death of King Frederick VII. (15th November, 1863) has something\r\nso tragical, so fatal to the destinies of Denmark, that it makes one\r\nthink of one of the most disconsolate sayings that antiquity has\r\nbequeathed to us, that mournful cry of the historian: \"_Non esse curae\r\ndeis securitatem nostram, esse ultionem._\"\r\n\r\nThis death gave in truth an entirely new turn to the Teutonic demands\r\ntowards the unfortunate Scandinavian monarchy. Germany did not content\r\nitself with a federal execution in Holstein; it pretended not to\r\nrecognize the sovereignty of the new king, Christian IX., in the\r\nDuchies, and wished to enthrone there that intriguing and treacherous\r\nfamily of Augustenburg from whom M. de Bismarck himself had lately\r\nobtained the retraxit for one million and a half _rixdalers_ paid by the\r\ngovernment of Copenhagen. And it was only from this moment that the\r\nplans of the minister of William I. seemed to be finally settled;\r\ndecidedly it was from the side of the Elbe that Prussia was to begin to\r\n\"round itself\" and complete its unity! The resolution once made, M. de\r\nBismarck carried it out with ardor, with audacity, with incomparable\r\nacuteness. This trial stroke was a master stroke; and the great\r\nMachiavelli would certainly have found a \"divine\" pleasure in\r\ncontemplating the address, or, as he would have said, the _virtu_ with\r\nwhich the cavalier of the Mark knew how, in the space of some weeks, to\r\nengross the attention of this poor Lord Russell; to encircle the Emperor\r\nNapoleon; to involve Austria in a distant expedition equally unjust and\r\nfoolish; to make use of and at the same time oust the _Bund_; to strike\r\nthe secondary States with terror and throw off their _protege_; lastly,\r\nto take into his own hands the holy cause of the German country, and,\r\naccording to the word of the Apostle, make himself all things to all\r\nmen!\r\n\r\nThe spectacle which Europe presented at the beginning of the year 1864,\r\nwas certainly one of the strangest and most painful that history has\r\nknown. Two great Powers, jealous of one another, and even destined to\r\nsoon fight in mortal combat for the spoils torn from their victim,--two\r\ngreat Powers, at once incited and cried down by a whole league of\r\nprinces and peoples of Germany, attacked a feeble state, but\r\nnevertheless an old and glorious monarchy, and one whose existence was\r\nproclaimed by all the cabinets to be necessary to the balance of\r\nnations; they attacked it under the most futile pretext, in the name of\r\na cause which the very chief of the coalition had formerly qualified as\r\n\"eminently iniquitous, frivolous, disastrous, and revolutionary.\" It\r\nwas, moreover, to punish King Christian IX. for his disobedience to the\r\n_Bund_ that Prussia and Austria had charged themselves with this work of\r\n\"justice;\" and this work they inaugurated with a formal declaration of\r\ntheir own disobedience to the same _Bund_; they acted \"as proxies for\r\nGermany,\" and entire Germany protested against the usurpation of the\r\nmandate! All these monstrous things Europe saw and let pass, this same\r\nEurope which, in 1848 at the time of the first German aggression against\r\nthe Scandinavian monarchy, had not failed in its duty, and had fulfilled\r\nit nobly in spite of the great revolutionary tempest which might have\r\nserved it as an excuse. The Powers were then unanimous in defending the\r\nweak against the oppressor; the Emperor Nicholas was in accord on this\r\npoint with the Republic of General Cavaignac, and it was only the\r\ndiplomats improvised by the \"surprise\" of February who had not shown at\r\nthis time a sufficient knowledge of the conditions necessary for the\r\nequilibrium of the world. It has been reserved for the most tried\r\nstatesmen, for chancellors grown old in the tradition and respect for\r\ntreaties, for the representatives of regular and strong monarchies, to\r\nallow the consummation of a revolutionary work which the Bastide and\r\nPetetin would have thought their duty not to admit![47] Without doubt it\r\nis, above all, England who will bear before posterity the shame of the\r\nruin of Denmark, for she it was who had taken in hand the cause of the\r\nScandinavian kingdom, who had counseled, guided, reprimanded up to the\r\nlast day, and who had solemnly declared _that in the moment of danger it\r\n(Denmark) should not fight alone_; it would, however, be unjust to\r\npretend to completely exonerate the rest of the European Powers. More\r\nthan one thoughtful and honest mind assigned at that time to this\r\ndismemberment of a monarchy in the nineteenth century all the import\r\nthat another dismemberment had had in the preceding century, and foresaw\r\nfrom it with anxiety great overturnings and formidable catastrophes in\r\nthe future. The _naifs_, or, to speak with M. de Bismarck, the\r\n_profane_, could alone believe the game finished after this first stroke\r\ndealt to the right of nations, after this first exploit also of the\r\nmarvelous \"instrument\" which the Prussian government had employed so\r\nmany years and so much time to \"perfect.\"\r\n\r\nThe cannon of Missunde was for the cavalier of the Mark what the cannon\r\nof Toulon had formerly been for a certain officer of Corsica, and this\r\nshort campaign of the Duchies revealed many things to the future\r\nconqueror of Europe. He learned there that legitimate rights, sacred\r\ntreaties, stipulated minutes, the sworn faith and many other\r\nold-fashioned things reputed inassailable were much more feeble and\r\ndecaying than the poor fortresses erected by the Danes in the preceding\r\nages, and, if Moltke and Roon made in this war a perfectly satisfactory\r\ntrial of their needle gun, he could for his part prove the precious,\r\nunalterable qualities of his own instrument. It must be plainly said\r\nthat during the whole of this expedition against Denmark, Prince\r\nGortchakof did not cease to favor the Prussian minister by all means, to\r\ntender him with ardor, and very often privately, a helping hand at each\r\nnew difficulty. His aid was absolute and the more efficacious since it\r\ntook the appearance of a busy neutrality in search of a pacific\r\narrangement. It was thus that he aided the president of the council at\r\nBerlin in forcing into the stubborn head of Lord Russell the equally\r\nspecious and pleasing reasoning, that the occupation of Holstein by the\r\nfederal troops would become a title of validity in the hands of the new\r\nKing of Denmark. \"M. de Bismarck told me,\" Sir A. Buchanan wrote on the\r\n28th November, \"that a federal execution would prevent any revolutionary\r\nmovement in Holstein, and would be at the same time to a certain degree\r\nan _indirect recognition_ of King Christian IX. as Duke of Holstein on\r\nthe part of the Diet of Frankfort. His excellency affirmed that the\r\nalarming state of Germany forced him to proceed at once to the\r\nexecution; but he could not or would not explain to me how such an\r\nexecution could be a recognition of the sovereignty of King Christian,\r\nand could avoid the appearance of an occupation.\" Three days afterwards,\r\nthe 1st December, Lord Napier wrote on his part from St. Petersburg:\r\n\"The language of Prince Gortchakof makes me believe that he is\r\npersuaded that M. de Bismarck has _moderate views_ in this question. The\r\nvice-chancellor is disposed to consider a federal execution, if it is\r\nwell conducted, as a _preservative measure_. In his opinion, the federal\r\ntroops, acting according to judicious instructions, will assure order\r\nand maintain the necessary distinction between the legislative and the\r\ndynastic question.\" \"_I despoil, then I recognize!_\" said M. de Bismarck\r\nby a logic belonging to him alone,[48] but which Prince Gortchakof\r\nshared at this moment, and which the two friends soon tried to apply\r\nalso to Schleswig, after the chief of the foreign office had resigned\r\nhimself to it in Holstein. \"This morning the Russian vice-chancellor\r\nsuggested to me,\" again wrote Lord Napier from St. Petersburg under date\r\nof the 11th January, \"that one should bind Denmark to _admit_ the\r\noccupation of Schleswig by the forces of Austria and Prussia under title\r\nof a _guarantee_ given to these two Powers as regards the German\r\npopulation of the Duchy.\" Thus the state papers and the documents\r\ncommunicated to the _Rigsraad_ continue to instruct and edify us; one\r\ndoes not find there a single insinuation or \"suggestion\" sent from the\r\nbanks of the Spree against Denmark which was not at once reverberated on\r\nthe banks of the Neva. And yet Denmark has always been the friend and\r\nthe _protege_ of the empire of the czars! More than any other Power in\r\nthe world, Russia was interested in preserving the liberty of the\r\nBaltic, in not letting the port of Kiel fall into the hands of Germany;\r\nmore than any other Power, also, it was interested in remembering that\r\nCourland and Livonia talked German much more purely and harmoniously\r\nthan Schleswig! Lastly, it was certainly the cause of the revolution\r\nagainst that of legitimate sovereignty which was engaged in this debate\r\non the Eider; the old Nesselrode had declared so in a celebrated\r\ncircular, and what would the Emperor Nicholas have said of such\r\ncomplacency for revolution on the part of a Russian chancellor?\r\nAlexander Mikhailovitch will yet cause the astonishment of history by\r\nthe immensity of his gratitude towards M. de Bismarck.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThus was inaugurated, concerning Poland and Denmark, that common action\r\nof the two ministers of Russia and Prussia, which was to continue for so\r\nmany years, and have such a considerable, such a disastrous influence on\r\nthe affairs of the Continent. With this year 1863 the second period of\r\nthe ministry of Prince Gortchakof commences, his second _term_, which\r\nwas assuredly much less open to discussion. To the French \"cordiality,\"\r\nproperly dosed and taken in fact as a tonic, which had prevailed till\r\nthen, the Prussian friendship, undeniably too passionate and too\r\nabsorbing, succeeded. In fact, in this second period, Alexander\r\nMikhailovitch no longer preserved that calm and reserved mind, and that\r\nintelligent egotism which made his fortune at the time of his intimacy\r\nwith the Emperor Napoleon III.; he embraced all the opinions, every\r\ncause of his formidable friend at Berlin, unfortunately without\r\npossessing his astonishing flexibility of mind, his marvelous art of\r\nturning and twisting. Nothing, for instance, equals the address with\r\nwhich M. de Bismarck can, if necessary, forget a disagreeable past, and,\r\nabove all, be unable to remember his wrong-doings toward others; in\r\nfact, he has a charming euphemism, he calls them _misunderstandings_.\r\nMore than once, from the height of the tribune, he has adorned with this\r\nname his long and outrageous conflict against parliament which he\r\nsustained up to the war of 1866 against Austria (a little\r\nmisunderstanding which cost 40,000 men their lives!). And how can one\r\nhelp admiring the affection, the enthusiasm, which he has inspired in\r\nthat excellent Lord Russell, certainly the statesman whom he ridiculed\r\nand ill-treated the most in 1863, during the Danish contention? As for\r\nhis Polish quarrels with the Eastern Powers in the same year (1863), he\r\nwas the more ready to forget them as those very Powers felt that a great\r\nact of folly had been committed. He dictated to King William a most\r\npolite reply, full of tender souvenirs of Compiegne, in answer to the\r\nletter of Napoleon III. concerning the congress, and toward the end of\r\nthe year he was already in touching accord with the cabinet of the\r\nTuileries concerning the treaty of London, a treaty which guaranteed the\r\nentireness of the Danish monarchy, and which a circular of M. Drouyn de\r\nLhuys now qualified as an _impotent work_! As regards Austria, he soon\r\ngranted it full indulgence for its Polish error in the spring, and even\r\nforgave the very reprehensible enterprise which it attempted in the\r\nmonth of August at Frankfort, on _the day of the princes_. In the month\r\nof November he had already made it his companion and accomplice in the\r\nwars of the Duchies. Prince Gortchakof appeared in a very different\r\nlight; he was never willing to pardon France and Austria for their\r\nintermeddling in the affairs of Poland, and remained immovable to every\r\nattempt at reconciliation. He knew no intimacy except with the cabinet\r\nof Berlin, and his former colleague of Frankfort became his only\r\nconfidant and ally. The famous aphorism of 1856 then underwent an\r\nimportant modification; beginning with 1863, the Russian chancellor\r\nbegan to sulk while continuing to _meditate_, and the Achaeans have paid\r\ndearly for this spite of Achilles. The \"sulks\" of Alexander\r\nMikhailovitch have been almost as fatal for Europe as the dreams of\r\nNapoleon III.\r\n\r\nThis Napoleonic policy regarding the affairs of Germany, at once\r\nreasonable and chimerical, ingenious and ingenuous, which he sincerely\r\nthought would work good, and which only accumulated disasters and ruin,\r\nseemed like a dream, a real _summer night's dream_. One day they had a\r\nsublime vision at the Tuileries: Italy was completed in its unity,\r\nAustria reexalted, Prussia rendered more homogeneous, Germany more\r\nsatisfied, Europe regenerated, and France consolidated and glorious. All\r\nthis only depended on a single hypothesis, but a hypothesis which did\r\nnot exist, on a battle fought and won by the brave _Kaiserliks_ always\r\ninured against this Prussian _Landwehr_ which for half a century had not\r\nsmelt powder, and it was on this frail skiff, on this \"nut-shell,\" as\r\nthe Puck of Midsummer Night's Dream had said, that the fortune of Caesar\r\nand that of France was embarked! In fact, at this moment, all the world\r\nbelieved in the incomparable military superiority of Austria over its\r\nbold rival in Germany; no one admitted the possibility of a Prussian\r\nvictory, still less a victory as decisive, as startling as that at\r\nSadowa. \"That was,\" M. Rouher said later, in a memorable session of the\r\nlegislative body,--\"that was an event which Austria, which France, which\r\nthe military man, which the simple citizen had all considered as\r\nunlikely; for there was an universal presumption that Austria would be\r\nvictorious and that Prussia would pay, and pay dearly, the price of its\r\nimprudence.\" This presumption, very real and universal at that time,\r\nremained the sole excuse of Napoleon III. before history, for that\r\nlamentable phantasmagoria which was announced to the world by the speech\r\nof Auxerre in the month of May, 1866, but whose origin goes back as far\r\nas the convention of September and the first journey of M. de Bismarck\r\nto France after his campaign in Denmark in the autumn of 1864.[49]\r\n\r\n\"I have at least one superiority over my conqueror,\" the Emperor of\r\nAustria, Francis I., said to M. de Talleyrand, the negotiator of the\r\npeace of Presburg, with a dignity not without keenness; \"I can reenter\r\nmy capital after such a disaster, while it would be difficult for your\r\nmaster, in spite of all his genius, to do the same thing in a similar\r\nsituation.\" This curious _mot_ displayed in a striking manner the\r\nprofound, incurable vice of all Caesarism. No more than the conqueror of\r\nAusterlitz, could Napoleon III. accept a check; he was obliged _to do\r\ngreat things_, condemned to success and prestige. Soon after the\r\nmisadventures and the miscalculations in the affairs of Poland, of\r\nDenmark, and of the congress, he was forced to look out for a revenge,\r\nhe cast his glances from north to south, \"struck an attitude\" by means\r\nof the convention of September, which seemed to be the preface of a new\r\nand great work. He was isolated in Europe, incensed against England,\r\nvery much embarrassed in regard to Russia, more than cool with Austria,\r\nand it was with a certain inward trepidation that one saw M. de Bismarck\r\nhasten to France (October, 1864) at the first news of the convention\r\nconcluded with the cabinet of Turin. Evidently \"something was to be done\r\nfor Italy;\" without rancor, as without prejudices, the president of the\r\nPrussian council came to renew the conversations broken off two years\r\nbefore at the time of his short mission to Paris.\r\n\r\nHe added nothing to the truth; he only affirmed that his alliance with\r\nthe Hapsburg in the war against Denmark had been a simple incident, and\r\nhe allowed to be clearly seen his desire to keep for Prussia the\r\ncountries recently conquered on the Elbe in the name of the Germanic\r\nConfederation. For the rest, he only varied the ancient theme on the\r\ninevitable imminent duel between Berlin and Vienna, on the advantages\r\nwhich Italy might gather from it, on the advantage that would accrue to\r\nFrance, having Prussia, with a better defined and firmer outline, as its\r\nnatural, unfailing ally in all the questions of _civilization_ and\r\n_progress_. Such expressions, coming from a minister who had shown his\r\ncharacter in the campaign of the Duchies, now met an auditory much more\r\nattentive than that of 1862. Without yet taking him for a perfectly\r\n_serious_ man, they began to recognize in him the qualities of a useful\r\nman, of a man of the future, whom Italy should cultivate with care, whom\r\nFrance, for its part, should watch carefully, encourage, and manage. The\r\nleaders of the imperial democracy, Prince Napoleon first of all, showed\r\nthemselves especially taken with the prospectives which were opened to\r\nthem. A distinguished member of this group, a diplomat reputed to be\r\nacute above all, and whose name even allied him to the Italian cause,\r\nwas sought out in his retreat and placed at the head of the mission at\r\nBerlin, elevated now to an embassy. Another member of the \"party of\r\naction,\" equally unattached for some time, a former ambassador at Rome,\r\nwas not long in being recalled into the councils of the empire: by the\r\nside of M. Rouher, he was destined to form there a useful counterpoise\r\nto the slightly \"antiquated\" ideas of M. Drouyn de Lhuys. Finally, on\r\nthe other side of the Alps, at Turin, a general, well known for his\r\n\"Prussomania,\" had taken in hand the direction of political affairs on\r\nthe 23d September. Each of these personages,--M. Benedetti, M. de La\r\nValette, General La Marmora,--will have his _role_ and his day in the\r\ngreat drama of 1866.\r\n\r\nAt this time, however, in the autumn of 1864, no plan was fixed or even\r\ndiscussed: one had only come as yet to simple confidences, to vague and\r\nfleeting conversations, to that which, in diplomatic language, one had\r\nnot even dared to call an exchange of ideas; but the impression which\r\nthe Prussian minister obtained from this rapid journey to France was\r\nsufficiently encouraging for him soon to launch that circular of the\r\n24th December, 1864, which became the point of departure for his action\r\nagainst Austria. It was in this circular, in fact, that M. de Bismarck\r\nbroached for the first time the question of the countries of the Elbe,\r\nwhich he well knew to be a question of war. Six months before, in the\r\nperemptory declaration made the 28th May, 1864, in the midst of the\r\nconference of London, Austria and Prussia had demanded the \"reunion of\r\nthe Duchies of Schleswig and of Holstein in a single state under the\r\nsovereignty of the hereditary Prince of Augustenburg,\" and the cabinet\r\nof Berlin took care to add then that this prince had, \"in the eyes of\r\nGermany, _the greatest right_ to the succession; that his recognition by\r\nthe _Bund_ was consequently assured, and that, moreover, he would\r\nreunite the _indubitable suffrages_ of the great majority of the\r\npopulation of this country.\" Quite different were the sentiments of the\r\nPrussian minister towards the end of the same year, some time after his\r\nreturn from Paris. In a circular dispatch addressed to the German\r\ncourts, the president of the council of Berlin declared now (24th\r\nDecember, 1864) that grave doubts assailed his mind touching the titles\r\nof the Duke of Augustenburg, that several serious competitors, such as\r\nthe Princes of Oldenburg and Hesse, had arisen in the interval;[50]\r\nthat in the midst of such multiplied and such confused claims he was\r\nperplexed; that his conscience was not sufficiently enlightened on this\r\npoint of right; that he felt the need of meditating and of \"consulting\r\nthe legists!\"\r\n\r\nThe world knows the magnificent decree which the \"legists\"--the syndics\r\nof the crown--did not delay in pronouncing, as well as the conclusions\r\nwhich the scrupulous minister conscientiously drew from them. There were\r\njudges at Berlin, and they proved it in overruling all parties, in\r\ndeclaring them all badly grounded in their pretensions: Hesse,\r\nOldenburg, Brandenburg, Sonderburg, Augustenburg, none of them had the\r\nright of succession to Schleswig-Holstein. The King of Denmark alone had\r\nthe titles! But as the King of Denmark had been forced by the war to\r\nabandon the provinces of the Elbe to the sovereigns of Prussia and\r\nAustria, M. de Bismarck concluded therefrom that the two monarchs could\r\ndispose of their \"property\" as they wished, without any intervention of\r\nthe _Bund_, and he demanded of the Emperor Francis Joseph the cession of\r\nhis part of the conquest for ready cash. The Prussian minister made\r\nthis impudent demand in an arrogant dispatch, full of menaces, dated the\r\n11th July, 1865, from Carlsbad, from the very place where the old King\r\nWilliam had come to enjoy the Austrian hospitality during the season.\r\nThe alarm was great for some weeks. M. de Bismarck made no mystery of\r\nthe negotiations which he entered upon with Italy; he said to M. de\r\nGramont \"that far from dreading the war, he desired it by all means;\"\r\nsome days after, he even declared to M. de Pfordten, president of the\r\ncouncil of Bavaria, \"that Austria could not sustain a campaign, that it\r\nwould suffice to strike a single blow, to fight a single and great\r\nbattle from the side of Silesia to obtain satisfaction of the Hapsburg.\"\r\nIn reality, he only wished to sound the ground and to make a careful\r\nexamination. At this moment he was not yet sufficiently sure of the\r\ndisposition of the Emperor Napoleon to dare to risk the great cast; he\r\nalso wanted time to persuade the pious Hohenzollern to pronounce the\r\n\"God wills it!\" of a fratricidal war. He had to content himself with\r\nthat convention of Gastein (14th August, 1865) which was only a\r\nprovisional arrangement, yet the first breach made in the rights of the\r\n_Bund_, and like an indirect consecration of the conclusions which he\r\nhad pretended, to draw from the decree pronounced by the famous syndics\r\nof the crown.\r\n\r\nThe very day on which he signed this equivocal transaction at Gastein,\r\nM. de Bismarck wrote his wife a short note as follows: \"For several days\r\nI have not found a moment of leisure to write you. Count Blome is again\r\nhere, and we are doing our best to preserve peace and stop up the\r\ncrevices of the building. Day before yesterday I devoted an entire day\r\nto hunting. I think that I wrote you that I returned disgusted from my\r\nfirst expedition; this time I at least killed a roe, but I saw nothing\r\nelse during the three hours that I devoted without cessation to\r\nexperiments on all sorts of insects, and the noisy activity of the\r\ncascade below me drew from my heart the cry: '_Little brook, leave there\r\nthy murmur._'[51] After all, it was a very good shot made across the\r\nprecipice. The animal, killed instantly, fell with its four feet in the\r\nair from a height of several church steeples into the torrent at my\r\nfeet.\" After all, he no more missed the shot than when he slew, in order\r\nthat he might no longer be the cherished candidate of the _Bund_, the\r\npoor Augustenburg, and made the little Duchy of Lauenberg fall into the\r\nPrussian game-bag! This fact of the chase and of diplomacy even had an\r\nextraordinary reecho in Germany, in France, and even as far as Lord\r\nRussell, who experienced the shock. The principal secretary of state\r\ninsisted on the honor of associating himself with M. Drouyn de Lhuys in\r\na very eloquent protest against the arrangements made at Gastein, and\r\nthe iron-clad squadron of England, which had not appeared in the Baltic\r\nsince the war of Denmark, came this time at least to pay a courteous\r\nvisit to the French fleet at Cherbourg. There, however, the\r\ndemonstration of the two Powers of the East limited itself; M. de\r\nBismarck could enjoy in peace his triumph and the title of count which\r\nthe fortunate campaign of 1865 brought him.\r\n\r\nIs it admissible to depart from the gravity of history to describe still\r\nanother incident of Gastein, a little _genre_ picture of manners which\r\nwas much talked of at this epoch, and even became the object of\r\nconfidential explanations between the president of the Prussian council\r\nand a devoted friend, all extremely devout? And why not, since the\r\nletter of M. de Bismarck to M. Andre (de Roman) concerning Mlle. Pauline\r\nLucca is one of the most curious pages of his familiar correspondence,\r\nif it throws light in a very picturesque manner on that vast and bald\r\nforehead on which the hand of King William had just placed the coronet\r\nof a count. Well, in the midst of those political negotiations and the\r\ndeer hunts, M. de Bismarck found time at Gastein to be photographed in a\r\nromantic attitude with Mlle. Lucca, first _cantatrice_ of the royal\r\nopera at Berlin. The photographs caused a certain scandal on the banks\r\nof the Spree; the leaders of _the party of the cross_ were especially\r\nmoved at the thermal license which the former Levite of the tabernacle,\r\nthe fervent disciple of MM. Stahl and de Gerlach, took. M. Andre (de\r\nRoman) was perfectly willing to accept the _role_ of Nathan in the\r\nBible, and, in a sermon written in entire confidence, he did not limit\r\nhimself to talking of the Bethsabea of the opera; he also spoke some\r\nwell-chosen words touching the reparation by arms which the first\r\nminister of Prussia had but lately wished to impose on the good Doctor\r\nVirchow, the very learned and very peaceful discoverer of _trichina_. M.\r\nAndre found that that was not the conduct of a true Christian; he did\r\nnot conceal that his old friends sighed at not seeing their Eliakim\r\nassist at divine service, and even began to be rather uneasy at the\r\nstate of his soul. It was to such a sermon that M. de Bismarck replied\r\nby the confidential letter which follows, and which a lucky indiscretion\r\nhas since given to the public, a letter assuredly very characteristic,\r\nand which makes one think once more of Cromwell, whose memory has been\r\nso often called forth in the course of this study:--\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR ANDRE,[52]--Although my time is very much restricted, I\r\n     cannot, however, refuse to reply to a summons addressed to me\r\n     by an upright heart, and in the name of Christ. I am\r\n     profoundly pained at scandalizing Christians who have faith,\r\n     but I have the certainty that it is an inevitable\r\n     circumstance in my position. I will not yet speak of the\r\n     parties who are necessarily opposed to me in politics, and\r\n     who not the less count in their midst a great number of\r\n     Christians, who have far preceded me in the way of salvation,\r\n     and with whom, nevertheless, I am obliged to be in conflict\r\n     on account of matters which, in my estimation as well as\r\n     theirs, are terrestrial; I appeal only to what you yourself\r\n     said: 'That nothing that is omitted or committed in the\r\n     elevated regions remains hidden.' Where is the man who, in a\r\n     similar situation, would not cause scandal, rightly or\r\n     wrongly? I will grant you much more still, for your\r\n     expression 'does not remain hidden' is not exact. Would to\r\n     God that apart from the sin the world knows I had not upon my\r\n     soul others which remain unknown, and for which I can only\r\n     hope for pardon in my faith in the blood of Christ! As a\r\n     statesman, I even think that I use far too much\r\n     consideration; according to my idea I am rather cowardly, and\r\n     that perhaps because it is not so easy in the questions\r\n     which come before me to arrive always at that clearness at\r\n     the bottom of which confidence in God exists. He who\r\n     reproaches me with being a political man without conscience,\r\n     wrongs me; he should first commence by himself testing his\r\n     conscience on the field of battle. As regards the matter of\r\n     Virchow, I have long since passed the age in which, on\r\n     similar questions, one seeks counsel from flesh and blood. If\r\n     I expose my life for a cause, I do it not only in this faith\r\n     which I have fortified by a long and painful combat, but also\r\n     by fervent and humble prayer before God; this faith, the word\r\n     of man cannot shake, not even the word of a friend in the\r\n     Lord, and of a servant of the church. It is not true that I\r\n     have never attended a church. For just seven months, I have\r\n     been either absent from Berlin or ill; who then can have made\r\n     the observation on my negligence? I willingly agree that it\r\n     has often happened, much less for want of time than for\r\n     considerations of health, especially in the winter; I am\r\n     always ready to give more detailed explanations to all those\r\n     who consider it their vocation to be my judges in this\r\n     matter: as for you, you will believe me without other details\r\n     of medicine. As to the Lucca photograph, you would probably\r\n     judge less severely, if you knew to what chance it owes its\r\n     origin. Besides, Mlle. Lucca, although a _cantatrice_, is a\r\n     lady whom the world has never, any more than it has me,\r\n     reproached with illicit relations. Nevertheless, I would have\r\n     certainly taken care to keep away from the glass pointed at\r\n     us, if I had in a tranquil moment reflected on the scandal\r\n     which so many faithful friends would find in this jest. You\r\n     see by the details into which I enter that I consider your\r\n     letter as well meant, and that I do not dream in any way of\r\n     placing myself above the judgment of those who share with me\r\n     the same faith; but I expect from your friendship and from\r\n     your Christian knowledge which you commend to others, in\r\n     future circumstances, more indulgence and charity in their\r\n     judgments: all of us have need of them. I am of the great\r\n     number of sinners to whom the glory of God is wanting; I do\r\n     not hope the less with them that in His mercy, He will not\r\n     withdraw from me the staff of the humble faith by the aid of\r\n     which I seek to find my way in the midst of the doubts and\r\n     dangers of my position; this confidence, however, should not\r\n     render me deaf to the reproaches of friends, nor impatient at\r\n     proud and harsh judgments.\"\r\n\r\nLet us lock up the hair shirt with the discipline; let us only think of\r\nthe diplomat in tunic and helmet, of the \"iron count\" (_der eiserne\r\nGraf_), as his people soon called him, and let us look at the\r\ndisposition of France towards him at the moment when, after having left\r\nthe rugged valley of Gastein, he prepared to visit the delightful region\r\nof Biarritz, to salute, interrogate, divine, and ... cast down the\r\nsphinx!\r\n\r\nIn the councils of the empire the debates had become from day to day\r\nsharper between the ancients and the moderns, between those zealous for\r\nthe new right and the partisans of a more circumspect and traditional\r\npolicy, in proportion as the Austro-Prussian conflict had grown more\r\nbitter and aggravated. The ardent ones would have willingly concluded an\r\noffensive and defensive alliance with Prussia. They showed the\r\nirresistible movement which was drawing Germany towards unity, and the\r\nadvantages which France would reap by favoring this evolution in place\r\nof opposing it, by attaching to itself by the ties of an eternal\r\nrecognition the Piedmont of Germany, as it had already done with that of\r\nthe peninsula. Passionate friends of Italy, and still more violent\r\nadversaries of Austria, this bulwark of the reaction, of legitimacy and\r\nof temporal power, they cherished in the kingdom of Frederick the Great\r\nthe incontestable representative of civilization, and trembled at seeing\r\nit going toward certain defeat in an unequal contest with the\r\n_Kaiserliks_. To hear them, the united action of France, Italy, and\r\nPrussia was not too much to preserve the cause of progress and to place\r\nEurope on new and immovable bases. Why, however, should not Belgium be\r\nthe legitimate recompense of the French efforts in favor of Germany, as\r\nSavoy had been in consequence of the constitution of the kingdom of\r\nItaly, and how decline a combination in which each of the three nations\r\nrepresenting _par excellence_ modern ideas on the Continent was called\r\nto complete its respective unity?\r\n\r\nVery different was in this respect the sentiment of the \"ancients,\" the\r\nstatesmen of the old school, of a whole political group of which M.\r\nDrouyn de Lhuys was in the cabinet the most authorized and clearsighted,\r\nif not the firmest. First casting aside all desire for Belgium, as a\r\ncertain cause of a formidable conflict with England, they asserted the\r\nabsolute impossibility of finding for France a compensation, however\r\nsmall it might be, in proportion to the injury which the unification of\r\nGermany would cause it. Without misunderstanding the Germanic\r\naspirations for a federal reform, for a more homogeneous and united\r\nconstitution, they asked what obligation France was under to hasten such\r\na work, and if in any case it were not more desirable that such a\r\ntransformation should be accomplished by the enlightened and pacific\r\nclasses, by the federal diet, even by Austria,--always respecting\r\nacquired rights and particular sovereignties,--rather than by a power\r\npeculiarly military, bureaucratic, and centralistic? Was not that also\r\nthe almost general wish of the other side of the Rhine, of the dynasties\r\nas well as of the chambers, of the princes as well as of the peoples,\r\nand had not the pretension of Prussia, among others, of confiscating for\r\nits own profit the conquest of Denmark aroused the consciences of all of\r\nthem? Only the press of France and Italy which persisted in speaking of\r\n\"the Piedmontese mission\" of the Hohenzollern; on the banks of the Main\r\nand Elbe, every one rejected this pretended mission, and even the\r\n_National-Verein_, brought into contempt some time before while\r\ndemanding \"a united Germany with a Prussian point,\" did not the less\r\nrepudiate M. de Bismarck, and declared him unworthy of taking in hand so\r\nholy a cause. As to the danger of seeing Prussia succumb in the\r\nconflict, and thus render the Hapsburg all powerful in Germany, there\r\nwas a very simple means of preventing such an eventuality, that was to\r\nrefuse the government of Berlin any aid in the enterprise which it\r\nmeditated. However bold in truth M. de Bismarck was, it was not doubtful\r\nthat he would never dare to defy Austria and its allies of the _Bund_ in\r\nthe face of a formal veto of France, which at the same time would take\r\nfrom him all hope of aid from Italy.[53] The plan to follow in such\r\nevents seemed then as clearly indicated as singularly easy. Without\r\nmixing directly in German affairs, without wounding at all the Teutonic\r\nsusceptibilities, one could oppose an insuperable barrier to Prussian\r\nambition; one had only to maintain the _statu quo_. Such a policy would\r\ninevitably have the warm support of England, and would encourage the\r\nresistance of Austria and the secondary States. Without doubt, the\r\nVenetian question would be thus warded off; but, besides that, the peace\r\nof Europe and the greatness of France were well worth \"the pearl of the\r\nAdriatic;\" it was not forbidden to have great hopes for the city of\r\nlagoons from the progress of time, and from the good relations preserved\r\nand augmented between France and Austria.\r\n\r\nGenerally silent in the midst of these contradictory debates, loving,\r\nmoreover, to plan beneath the passions and agitations of his surrounding\r\ncounselors in the serenity of a calm and meditative intelligence, the\r\nEmperor Napoleon III. slowly ripened a project which seemed to him to\r\nsufficiently take into consideration the different arguments of the two\r\nsides, and which, moreover, well answered the recommendation made by him\r\nat about the same time to his minister of foreign affairs, _inertia\r\nsapientia_! Italy naturally was of more real interest to him than to M.\r\nDrouyn de Lhuys; that was a passion, perhaps indeed a youthful contract,\r\nand it was even so with the Empress Eugenie, who had become ardent for\r\nthe affranchisement of Venice since the entry of M. de La Valette to the\r\nministry, also since the day when M. the Cavalier Nigra had turned some\r\ncouplets full of graceful allusions to a gondola which she had had made\r\nfor the lake of Fontainbleau. Not less inveterate, but much more fatal,\r\nwas Louis Napoleon's liking for the country of Bluecher and Scharnhorst;\r\nthe \"great destinies\" of the monarchy of Brandenburg in Germany formed\r\none of the articles of his cosmopolitan faith. \"_The geographical\r\nposition of Prussia is badly defined!_\" as he cried out the following\r\nyear, at a solemn moment, and in a document too much forgotten.[54] He\r\ncertainly did not intend to destroy the empire of Hapsburg, and allow\r\nthe Hohenzollern to rule from the Sound to the Adriatic, as such a\r\ncourse would have readily recognized the _intransigeans_ and the\r\nknow-nothings of the principle of nationality. A strong appreciator of\r\nlogic in the affairs of states, and in that (in that alone, perhaps!)\r\ntruly French spirit, the former prisoner of Ham would have willingly\r\nconstructed an essentially Protestant Prussia opposed to a traditionally\r\nCatholic Austria in the centre of Germany, leaving for the secondary\r\nStates an intermediary and fluctuating situation in a religious as well\r\nas in a political point of view. An augmented and rounded Prussia on\r\nthe Elbe and the Baltic, and thus rendered \"stronger and more\r\nhomogeneous in the North,\" seemed to him a useful combination, almost\r\nindispensable, counterbalancing Russia, and it was perfectly just that\r\nin exchange for new and vast Protestant territories, which it would\r\nacquire, the monarchy of Frederick II. should lose Silesia, a Catholic\r\ncountry and former patrimony of Hapsburg, that it should also renounce\r\nthe Catholic provinces of the Rhine, situated too far outside of its\r\nnatural orbit. \"One would thus maintain for Austria its great position\r\nin Germany,\" above all its position as a great Catholic state, and the\r\nreturn of Silesia would be for the Emperor Francis Joseph an ample\r\ncompensation for the Venetian province which he would cede to King\r\nVictor Emmanuel. For the secondary States of the Confederation, one\r\nwould mediatize for their profit several of the little unimportant\r\nprinces; one would add to them, perhaps, as a new member of the _Bund_,\r\na new State composed entirely of Rhenish provinces taken from Prussia;\r\none would assure for them, in any case, \"a closer union, a more powerful\r\norganization, a more important _role_,\" which the great leaders of the\r\nparty of Wuerzburg, the advocates of the _triad_, MM. de Beust, de\r\nPfordten, and de Dalwigk, did not cease to demand. A curious fact, in\r\nthese vast projects which embraced the world and which tended to\r\ndetermine and to satisfy the \"legitimate wants\" of Italy, Prussia,\r\nAustria, the Germanic Confederation, the only obscure question, and\r\nnever decided in the mind of the French sovereign, was that of the\r\ncompensations which, in the presence of this universal alteration, he\r\ncould claim for his own country. He did not dare to touch the problem\r\nof Belgium; it would be, he declared very honestly, \"an act of\r\nbrigandage.\"[55] Neither did he deceive himself on the impossibility of\r\nannexing important Germanic territories; generally he stopped at the\r\nidea of a simple rectification of frontiers on the side of the Saar and\r\nthe Palatinate, and of the neutralization of the German line of\r\nfortresses on the Rhine. Even reduced to these modest proportions, the\r\nend did not seem to him to be less worthy of being ardently pursued, in\r\nview of the very great and moral satisfaction France would find in the\r\nachievement of its work in Italy, and in the rational ordering of\r\naffairs in Germany.\r\n\r\nMoreover, that which, in the situation in which he was engaged,\r\nespecially flattered his instincts, generous at bottom and vaguely\r\nhumanitarian, was that he hoped to reap considerable advantages for his\r\nown country, for the entire universe, without any necessity of drawing\r\nthe sword, without spilling a drop of blood, \"by moral force only,\" by\r\nthe ascendancy of the name of France. He was resolved to \"remain in a\r\nwatchful neutrality,\" not to leave it except in the extreme case of the\r\ntoo complete victories of one of the belligerents menacing \"the\r\noverthrow of the equilibrium and the modification of the map of Europe\r\nfor the benefit of a single Power.\" He proclaimed it very loudly, on all\r\noccasions, and gloried in such \"disinterested\" policy,--a very strange\r\npolicy, however, and which, according to the very judicious _mot_ of\r\nPrince Napoleon, declared itself in advance _hostile to the conqueror_.\r\n\"You have changed the address of your letter,\" said with fine raillery\r\nthe conqueror of Austerlitz to the Prussian envoy who brought him the\r\ncongratulations of his sovereign; the nephew of Napoleon I. acted in\r\nsuch a manner that he could not change the address, alienating in\r\nadvance the still unknown conqueror. It is true that he believed he knew\r\nhim, that, with all the world, he saw him in the Emperor of Austria, and\r\nthat he counted on making with him preventive arrangements. Moreover,\r\neven should the army of William I. show itself much superior to the\r\ngeneral opinion one had of it,--and, more perspicacious in that than his\r\nfollowers, he fully admitted such an eventuality,--still he only saw in\r\nthis case a long and fatiguing conflict which would exhaust the two\r\nparties and would allow him more easily to intervene as judge of the\r\ncombat and as protector of the right. He thus hoped, in any case, at his\r\ntime and at his convenience, to be able to pronounce a word of peace, of\r\nequity, and of equilibrium, and he was convinced that \"this word would\r\nbe heard.\" It was important for the moment that Prussia should begin the\r\ncombat, and to decide it in its favor it would be necessary for it to\r\nprocure the alliance of Italy. It was also necessary to carefully avoid\r\nwith the court of Berlin an untimely debate on the combinations and\r\ncompensations to come; the least insistence on this delicate point might\r\nwound the patriotic feelings of William I., cool his warlike ardor,\r\ndestroy in the embryo a world of great things, _novus rerum ordo_! It\r\nwas better to ask nothing, to promise nothing, to compromise nothing.\r\nMoreover, what use in demanding notes of a bankrupt, taking sureties\r\nfrom one whose fate seemed so little assured, and whom, according to all\r\nprobabilities, one would soon have to protect, to defend against too\r\nhard conditions which its Austrian conqueror would wish to impose on it?\r\n\r\nSo complicated and specious as was the strategy planned by the Emperor\r\nof the French, there is no doubt that M. de Bismarck penetrated it from\r\nthe beginning, that he divined it, foresaw it in some way, even before\r\nit was completely fixed in the mind of its author, and we have on this\r\nsubject a most striking proof. In the month of August, 1865, at the time\r\nwhen the first conferences were held between the two governments of\r\nPrussia and Italy against Austria, which were soon to interrupt the\r\nbrusque conclusion of the armistice of Gastein, M. Nigra wrote to\r\nGeneral La Marmora, being evidently inspired by the observations of his\r\nPrussian colleague at Paris, Count Goltz: \"The cabinet of Berlin would\r\nnot wish that, war once declared and begun, France should come, like the\r\nNeptune of Virgil, to dictate peace, lay down conditions, or convoke a\r\ncongress at Paris.\"[56] Thus all is foreseen in those few lines written\r\nlong before Biarritz, all up to that congress which a Napoleon III.\r\nwould naturally not fail to extol one day or another, and which he in\r\nfact was to advance in the month of May, 1866. \"The difficulty consists,\r\nthen,\" continues M. Nigra in his dispatch, \"in obtaining from France a\r\npromise of absolute neutrality. Will, or can, the Emperor Napoleon make\r\nthis promise? _Will he give it in writing as Prussia wishes it?_\" This\r\npromise of _absolute_ neutrality M. de Bismarck certainly did not obtain\r\nat Biarritz (October, 1865), still less was there a question of any\r\nengagement _in writing_; but he learned there from august lips that\r\nItaly was right in wishing to \"complete its unity,\" that it should not\r\nfail to profit by the first favorable occasion,--that France, for its\r\npart, was resolved to respect Germany, not to contradict on the other\r\nside of the Rhine the \"national aspirations.\" Unless the map of Europe\r\nwas to be modified to its detriment, France would preserve the\r\nneutrality, and this neutrality would not be other than \"favorable\" to a\r\ncombination in which the interests of Italy were engaged. It is\r\nallowable to recall a reminiscence which is like a fragment of the\r\nconversations of Biarritz in this curious declaration, made six months\r\nafterwards by the president of the council of Prussia to General\r\nGovone,[57] \"that apart from the profit which he might find in it, and\r\nwith no _regard for principles_, the Emperor of the French would sooner\r\napprove the great war for the German nationality than the war for the\r\nDuchies of the Elbe!\"\r\n\r\nWhat, during his sojourn at Biarritz, could hardly have escaped a\r\nsagacious observer like M. de Bismarck, was the hold which his profound\r\nattachment for the country of Cavour and Manin had on the mind of Louis\r\nNapoleon; there was the key to the position, the real word of the\r\nSphinx, and that certainty acquired, compensated in the eyes of the\r\nPrussian minister for many still disquieting doubts, made him pass over\r\nmany a reticence of the august, taciturn man.[58] For certain reasons,\r\nhe could even congratulate himself on the reserve which he preserved\r\ntowards him, on the care which he took to avoid a discussion in detail;\r\nthat released him on his part from any precise engagement, from any\r\npremature offer; it allowed him to confine himself to generalities, to\r\nmake fantastic journeys over spaces and centuries,--and he neglected\r\nnothing. He spoke of Belgium and a part of Switzerland as the necessary\r\nand legitimate complement of French unity,--of the common action of\r\nFrance and Germany for the cause of progress and humanity,--of a future\r\naccord between Paris, Berlin, and Florence, even London and Washington,\r\nto conduct the destinies of Europe, to regulate those of the entire\r\nworld, to lead, for instance, Russia to its real vocation in Asia and\r\nAustria to its civilizing mission on the Danube. How many times was seen\r\non this henceforward historical coast of the Gulf of Biscay, the Emperor\r\nNapoleon slowly walking and leaning on the arm of Prosper Merimee, while\r\nthe president of the Prussian council followed him at a respectful\r\ndistance, haranguing, gesticulating, and generally receiving for reply\r\nonly a dull and slightly incredulous look, and how the thought remains\r\nto-day sadly fixed on this strange group of the romantic Caesar, the\r\nromancing Cesarean and the terrible realist who, very obsequious at\r\nthis moment towards his imperial host, four years later was to harshly\r\nassign him the prison of Wilhelmshoehe! From time to time Napoleon III.\r\ncaused the author of \"Colomba\" to understand by a furtive pressure of\r\nthe arm how amusing he found this diplomat with the futile imagination,\r\nthis representative of a more than problematical Power, who so cleverly\r\ndismembered Europe and distributed the kingdoms. \"He is crazy!\" he even\r\nwhispered one day in the ear of his companion; but, before recriminating\r\na remark so cruelly expiated since, one can well recall the following\r\npassage of a dispatch which General Govone wrote the year after: \"In\r\nspeaking to me of Count Bismarck, M. Benedetti told me that he was, so\r\nto speak, a _maniacal_ diplomat,\"[59] and M. Benedetti took care to add\r\nthat he had long known his man, that he had \"followed\" him for nearly\r\nfifteen years!\r\n\r\nIs it not necessary in fact to be a little _maniacal_, to have that\r\n\"little grain of folly\" which Moliere attributes to all great men, and\r\nwhich Boerhaave believes he finds in every great genius,[60] to launch\r\nthe monarchy of Brandenburg into an adventure so eminently perilous as\r\nthat of 1866? The minister of William I. remarked correctly, however, at\r\nParis, that he would perhaps meet a second Olmuetz, and his biographers\r\nquote a characteristic speech of his, \"that death on the scaffold is\r\nunder certain circumstances neither the most dishonorable nor the worst\r\nof deaths.\" In a diplomatic point of view, his only assurance was the\r\nprofound love of Napoleon III. for the Italian cause, and after as\r\nbefore Biarritz the \"Neptune of Virgil\" arose, always menacing, free to\r\npronounce his _quos ego_: the war once declared and begun, France could\r\nalways dictate peace, lay down the conditions or convoke a congress. The\r\nwhole point, then, was not to allow the benevolent neutrality of\r\nNapoleon III. the time to work those infallible changes; all that was\r\nnecessary was to act quickly and well, to strike a blow at the beginning\r\nwhich should dictate peace to Vienna and respect to Paris; victory was\r\nonly possible at this price! But, however, there has always been luck\r\nand misfortune in the affairs of this world,--\"the all powerful God is\r\ncapricious,\" according to the singular expression of M. de Bismarck at\r\none of the most solemn moments,[61]--how far could one count on an army\r\nformed only a few years before, and which, as well as its chiefs, had\r\nnever gone through a great campaign? An extraordinary circumstance in\r\ntruth, and one which will never cease to be an astonishing fact in\r\nhistory, of the two eminent men who took upon themselves more especially\r\nthe terrible responsibility of commencing the combat, neither of them\r\nhad had a superior command, or had made his name illustrious on a\r\nhistorical field of battle! Before 1864, the only campaign in which\r\nGeneral Moltke had ever assisted was that of Syria between the Turks and\r\nthe Egyptians; in 1864 he had borne arms against his own country in that\r\ninvasion of Denmark which was certainly not calculated to produce\r\nTurennes and Bonapartes. General de Roon had formed a part in 1832 of a\r\n\"corps of observation\" which watched the French besieging Antwerp, and\r\nhad only distinguished himself since by books of military geography.\r\n\"After all that we have heard said of these officers,\" General Govone\r\nwrote from Berlin on the 2d April, 1866, \"the army is not enthusiastic\r\nfor the war against Austria; there is rather in its ranks sympathy for\r\nthe Austrian army. I know well that the war, once declared, the army\r\nwill be electrified, and will do its duty bravely; but it is neither a\r\nspur nor a support for the policy which Count de Bismarck wishes to make\r\nprevail.\"[62]\r\n\r\nAs to public opinion in Germany, as to the national sentiment of the\r\nblond children of Arminius, far from finding there a \"spur and support,\"\r\nthe Prussian minister only met with repugnance and imprecations. All the\r\nNapoleonic ideology was necessary to see in the conflict which was\r\npreparing \"the great war for German nationality,\" all the blindness of\r\nthe authoritative and democratic press in France was necessary to\r\nassimilate the enterprise of M. de Bismarck on the other side of the\r\nRhine to the work of Cavour in the peninsula. The German nationality was\r\nneither oppressed nor threatened from any quarter; none of the States of\r\nthe _Bund_ groaned under a foreign dominion; the ruling houses in\r\nHanover, Saxony, Wuertemberg, Bavaria, etc., were indigenous, antique and\r\nglorious, popular and liberal dynasties; the larger part of these\r\ncountries enjoyed a constitutional and parliamentary system unknown at\r\nBerlin; the cities of Frankfort, Hamburg, Lubeck, Bremen were even\r\nrepublics! To-day, when success has obscured the conscience and even the\r\nmemory of contemporary generations, and when a sad philosophy of history\r\nis always on the point of justifying the present by falsifying the past,\r\none is prepared to recognize the \"providential,\" irresistible movement\r\nwhich drew Germany towards Prussian unity, and to almost call with M. de\r\nBismarck the campaign of 1866 \"a simple misunderstanding.\" The truth is\r\nthat this campaign was a civil war, a fratricidal combat, and it was not\r\nonly the Prussian people which repudiated the thought and even cursed\r\nits author on the eve of Sadowa. On the eve of Sadowa, the principal\r\ncities of the kingdom, Cologne, Magdeburg, Stittin, Minden, etc., sent\r\naddresses to the sovereign in favor of peace and against \"a baleful\r\npolicy of the cabinet,\" the great corporation of merchants of\r\nKoenigsberg, the city of Kant, even decided to no longer celebrate the\r\nking's birthday. On his arrival at Berlin, General Govone wrote: \"Not\r\nonly the upper classes, but even the middle classes are against or\r\nunfavorable to the war. This aversion shows itself in the popular\r\njournals; there is no hatred of Austria. More than that, although the\r\nchamber has neither great prestige nor great popularity, the debates\r\nstill create adversaries for Count de Bismarck.\" Two months later, and\r\nat the approach of hostilities, he wrote: \"Unfortunately the public mind\r\nin Prussia does not awaken in a perceptible manner, even face to face\r\nwith a situation so decisive, so vital for the country.\"[63]\r\n\r\nIt is true that none of these obstacles were of a nature to disturb the\r\npresident of the council at Berlin in his resolutions, nor to retard the\r\ncourse which was traced out. On the contrary there were quite other\r\ndifficulties and falterings against which he stumbled in the court\r\nitself, with the old fogies of Potsdam, especially with his sovereign,\r\nand in many a circumstance the \"iron count\" could well say, like a\r\ncertain cardinal, \"that the cabinet of the king and his _petit-coucher_\r\nembarrassed him more than all Europe.\" In spite of the faith of William\r\nI. in his \"mission from above,\" in spite of the equally strong\r\nresolution to preserve at any price his good port of Kiel, he did not\r\nthe less look upon an open conflict with the Emperor of Austria, an act\r\nof hostility declared against this German sovereign who bore the\r\nvenerated name of Hapsburg, as the last of extremities, and he did not\r\nwish to have recourse to it until after having exhausted all the means\r\nof an amiable settlement. For the extreme case, and in opposition to\r\nNapoleon III., he also greatly preferred the little war for the Duchies\r\nto \"the great war for German nationality;\" but what he disliked above\r\nall things, was the idea of a compact with Italy, a veritable compact,\r\noffensive and defensive, in place of a \"generic\" treaty with a vague\r\ndeclaration of _alliance and friendship_, and only destined, as one had\r\npersuaded him from the first, to make Austria reflect and bring it to an\r\nadjustment. He, the loyal Hohenzollern, to make war on a Hapsburg on\r\njoint and equal terms with a _Welche_,--he, the Lord's anointed, the old\r\ncombatant of the holy alliance, to become the brother in arms of a\r\nVictor Emmanuel, that representative of revolution, that usurper who had\r\noverthrown so many legitimate princes, besieged and dethroned his own\r\nnephew, and made Garibaldi in a red shirt sit near him, in the coach of\r\nthe king!\r\n\r\nThe faltering and compunctions on this point were very sincere.\r\nNotwithstanding what has been said, nothing less than the marvelous art\r\nof M. de Bismarck was necessary to triumph in the end over these\r\n\"syncopes\" of the mission, to operate on these tumors of the conscience.\r\n\"There is my doctor!\" said the old monarch of Prussia one day to a\r\nRussian princess who congratulated him on his good health, pointing to\r\nhis first minister.[64] The difficulty of _gaining over the king_, of\r\ntriumphing over his _superstitions_, over the _old ideas_, over his\r\n_legitimist scruples_,--these words were continually on the lips of M.\r\nde Bismarck in the confidential interviews of the spring of 1866, which\r\nthe valuable reports of General Govone have so fortunately preserved for\r\nposterity. Assuredly, in studying those reports, as well as the other\r\ndispatches which M. le Marquis La Marmora wished very much to deliver to\r\nthe public, one can enjoy the spectacle of a comedy in five different\r\nacts, all doing little honor to human nature; one can ask who bears away\r\nthe palm in duplicity of language, and in _aes triplex_ of the forehead,\r\nthe grandsons of Machiavelli or the heirs of the Teutonic order; one can\r\nadmire there how, to use an ingenuous expression of the Italian\r\nnegotiator, the Southern _viper_ attempts to _bite the charlatan_ of the\r\nNorth, and the charlatan puts his foot on the viper.[65] What, however,\r\nis the most curious and the most instructive in these documents is the\r\nquantity of matters which the president of the Prussian council\r\nsucceeded in this short space of some months in teaching his august\r\nmaster, a still greater quantity than he had made him forget. Without\r\ndoubt, one of the most remarkable of these forgetfulnesses is a certain\r\n_word of honor_ given in _June_, 1866, by a very august personage to the\r\nEmperor Francis Joseph, _that there was no treaty signed with\r\nItaly_,[66] when that treaty, a treaty of offensive and defensive\r\nalliance in good and due form, already counted at this moment two months\r\nof existence, which had been signed at Berlin the 8th April by the\r\nrespective plenipotentiaries, ratified by the King of Italy at Florence\r\non the 14th, and then ratified on the 20th by the King of Prussia at\r\nBerlin.\r\n\r\nBy the side of official Italy, the minister of William I. had taken care\r\nto equally attach discontented Italy, which murmured in the shallows of\r\nthe young monarchy, and General La Marmora complains on several\r\noccasions, in his interesting book, \"of the intimate and cordial\r\nrelations which the minister of Prussia at Florence, Count d'Usedom,\r\nentertained with some members of the party of action,\" and whose\r\nuntoward advice it followed only too often. On his part, the consul of\r\nPrussia at Bucharest held in hand (February, 1866) the thread of a\r\nconspiracy which was to bring about the fall of the Prince Couza, and\r\nmake a considerable difference in the action of the government at\r\nBerlin. \"Liberalism is childishness which it is easy to bring to reason;\r\nbut revolution is a force of which it is necessary to know how to avail\r\none's self,\" the cavalier of the Mark one day said at Paris, and he did\r\nnot delay to prove the two truths of his aphorism. It is known that his\r\nrelations with Mazzini were kept up a long time even after Sadowa,[67]\r\nand the engagements contracted in 1866 towards Prussia by the Magyar\r\nchiefs have since influenced, influence still at the present time, and\r\nmuch more than is generally thought, the external policy of the empire\r\nof the Hapsburg. It was also in the conventicles of the men of the\r\nEuropean revolution where the fantastic plan of campaign was worked out,\r\nwhich M. d'Usedom wished to force on General La Marmora in his famous\r\ndispatch of the 17th June;[68] in it he recommended making war\r\nthoroughly, to overturn the quadrilateral, to march along the Adriatic,\r\nto penetrate into Hungary, which would at once rise at the name of\r\nGaribaldi: \"we will thus strike Austria, not at the extremities, but at\r\nthe heart!\" As to the endeavor to form, under the orders of the refugee\r\nGeneral Klapka, a legion composed of deserters from the Austrian army,\r\nthe president of the Prussian council greatly wished to affirm before\r\nthe chambers of Berlin, in his celebrated speech of the 16th January,\r\n1874, that he had _rejected with energy all those projects at the\r\nbeginning of the war_. \"It was not until after the battle of Sadowa, at\r\nthe moment when the Emperor Napoleon III., by a telegraphic dispatch,\r\nhad caused the possibility of his intervention to be seen,--it was not\r\ntill then, and as an act of legitimate defense, that I did not order but\r\nonly tolerated the formation of this Hungarian legion.\" Unfortunately,\r\nthe dates are not quite in accord with the declarations of the present\r\nchancellor of Germany. The battle of Sadowa was fought the 3d July; but\r\non the 12th June, M. de Bismarck let the Italian government know that it\r\nhad definitely accepted the aid of the Sclavic and Hungarian\r\ndefections,[69] and it is established by evidence that, long before\r\nSadowa, even before any beginning of war, the Prussian government had\r\nhad recourse to a means which, according to the chancellor's own\r\nexpressions, \"would excite to revolt and treason the Magyar and\r\nDalmatian regiments of the Austrian army.\" Let us not forget, however,\r\nthat, while treating with Mazzini and M. Klapka, the minister of William\r\nI. was not sparing in denouncing to Europe the Jacobin spirit of the\r\nHouse of Hapsburg: \"The king, our august master,\" said a Prussian\r\ndispatch of the 26th January, 1866, \"is grievously affected at seeing in\r\nthe Duchies of the Elbe, and under the aegis of the Austrian eagle,\r\nrevolutionary tendencies, hostile to all thrones. If at Vienna they\r\nbelieve that they can tranquilly assist in this transformation of a race\r\ndistinguished up to the present time by its conservative sentiments into\r\na hot-bed of revolutionary agitations, we cannot do it for our part, and\r\nwe are decided not to do it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of such dark intrigues, and of negotiations more or\r\nless regular, of preparations for war and a continual exchange of notes,\r\nof parliamentary conflicts and of almost continual daily combats with\r\nthe \"old fogies\" of the court, that the first six months of the year\r\n1866 passed for the president of the council at Berlin, and rarely has a\r\nstatesman lived through a more troubled or disturbed period. The waves\r\nof events first cast him ashore, then threw him back again, and seemed\r\nto remove him farther than ever from his goal. The revolution in\r\nRoumania, and the election of Prince Hohenzollern by the people of\r\nBucharest, was, for instance, a great stroke of fortune, for this\r\nincident brusquely shut a door through which, in the opinion of more\r\nthan one politician at that time, the Venetian question might have\r\nresulted in peace,[70] and it was through efforts of the French, who\r\nhad contributed to the installation of the young Prussian prince on the\r\nbanks of the Danube! However, immediately after, M. de Bismarck was\r\nagain aroused from his security by vague rumors of conferences between\r\nAustria and France, touching the city of Saint Mark. He, at least,\r\nprofited by them to persuade the king to sign the secret treaty of the\r\n8th April with the government of Florence; but soon the offer of\r\ndisarming, made by the cabinet of Vienna, the debates in the midst of\r\nthe legislative body, and the manifestations of public opinion in\r\nFrance, more and more favorable to the cause of peace, produced a\r\ndespairing lull, and again gave courage to the numerous partisans of\r\nAustria at the court of William I. The Emperor Napoleon III. then\r\nrendered to the Prussian minister the signal service of again putting in\r\nmotion the great political machine which began to slacken. He made the\r\nspeech of Auxerre (6th May), and defied, with scorn, the treaties of\r\n1815. That did not, however, prevent him from immediately baffling all\r\nthe plans of M. de Bismarck, by the sudden proposition of a congress,\r\nand, at this new occurrence, which seemed to compromise everything, the\r\npresident of the council at Berlin spoke _for the first time_ of\r\ncompensations for France. \"I am much less German than Prussian,\" he said\r\nto General Govone; \"I would not have any difficulty in ceding to France\r\nthe whole country comprised between the Rhine and Mosel, but the king\r\nwould have very grave scruples.\"[71] Let it be well understood, he would\r\nin return demand of the French government an active cooperation in the\r\nwar. But what did not enter at all into the views of Napoleon III. was,\r\nthat the state of opinion in France did not even permit it to be thought\r\nof. In the interim, he learned that new negotiations had just been\r\nentered on between Austria and France concerning Venice, and that on the\r\nother side the king was making, without his knowledge, propositions to\r\nthe Emperor Francis Joseph for an amicable arrangement: William I.\r\nalways preferred the little question of the Duchies to the great war for\r\nthe German nationality! One can surmise what must have been at this\r\nmoment the state of mind of the minister who, for so many months,\r\ncomplained before the Count de Barral, Italian plenipotentiary at\r\nBerlin, of being betrayed by his agents at London, at Florence, and at\r\nParis. Moreover, he considered his life in danger since an attack made\r\non his person the 7th May; he was not without uneasiness about his\r\nsojourn at Paris during the congress in which he was going to take part,\r\nand which he dreaded for so many other reasons. \"He does not go out\r\nunaccompanied,\" wrote the Count de Barral, the 1st June, \"and agents of\r\nFrench police will come as far as the frontier to follow him during the\r\nwhole journey.\"[72]\r\n\r\nThe journey did not take place, as is known; Prussia, in the words of M.\r\nd'Usedom, was \"rescued from the congress,\" and Prince Gortchakof\r\ncontributed largely to this work of salvation. Always a ready friend, he\r\nwas the first to think that the projected conference had no \"practical\r\naim\" with the reservations which Austria wished to bring to it,[73] and\r\nthus gave the signal for the general overthrow. From that time M. de\r\nBismarck set himself to \"work on the mind of his royal master,\" and he\r\nended by freeing him from all _scruples_. \"His majesty,\" Count de Barral\r\ntelegraphed even on the 23d May from Berlin, \"was very much _moved_ at\r\nthe situation, of which he spoke with great tears in his eyes.\" Two\r\nweeks later, the 8th June, the king wept no longer, but \"he still had in\r\nhis voice something sad, indicating clearly the decision of a resigned\r\nman, who believed that he could not act differently. His majesty told me\r\nthat he had full confidence in the justice of his cause. I have a clear\r\nconscience,\" he added, with a moved air, and placing his hand on his\r\nheart; \"for a long time I have been accused of wishing war for ambitious\r\nviews, but now the whole world knows who is the aggressor.\"[74]\r\n\r\n\"I will return _via_ Vienna or Munich, or I will charge with the last\r\nsquadron, which will never return,\" M. de Bismarck said to a foreign\r\nambassador, at the moment of leaving Berlin for the head-quarters, the\r\n30th June, 1866. Two days later he was already at Jitschin, on the field\r\nstill smoking from a great battle which had just been fought there. \"I\r\nhave just arrived,\" he wrote to his wife from Jitschin; \"the ground is\r\nstill heaped up with corpses, horses, and arms. Our victories are much\r\ngreater than we thought.... Send me some French romances to read, but\r\nnot more than one at a time. May God keep you!\" This was written the 2d\r\nJuly, 1866; the next day the battle of Sadowa was fought; the next day\r\nGermany was at the feet of this singular lover of _French romances_; and\r\nthe Emperor Napoleon III. was sadly awakened from his own romance, from\r\nhis long humanitarian dream. Like the Titania of the \"Midsummer Night's\r\nDream,\" imperial France saw all at once that, in a state of\r\ninconceivable hallucination, she had caressed a monster.\r\n\r\nAnd while so many events were taking place on the world's stage, great,\r\nmarvelous, and terrible events, Russia continued to sulk and meditate;\r\nit meditated in the perpetual adoration of Prussia. One seeks in vain\r\nfor a trace of its action in the events which, nevertheless, concerned\r\nin so high a degree its interests, its family alliances, its secular\r\ntraditions. \"Since I have been in Russia,\" wrote M. Benedetti to his\r\nchief in the spring of the year 1866, \"let me mention that I have always\r\nremarked, not without surprise, the indifference with which the cabinet\r\nof St. Petersburg seems to me, from the beginning, to watch the\r\npretensions of Prussia and the eventuality of a conflict between the two\r\ngreat Germanic Powers; and what I have not been less struck with is the\r\n_constant security_ in which I have found M. de Bismarck as to the\r\nattitude and the intentions of the Empire of the North.\" Russia was\r\nsilent in 1865 during the crisis of Gastein; in the month of May, 1866,\r\nit only accepted the invitation to the congress to make them despair\r\nand to discourage the other Powers from it; it was absent from the\r\ndeliberations of Nikolsburg and of Prague; it left to France the care of\r\nmaking efforts for the South of Germany, for Saxony; it even left it the\r\nhonor of stipulating a clause in favor of unhappy Denmark, the country\r\nof the future empress! One moment, it is true, M. d'Oubril, the Russian\r\nambassador at Berlin, a diplomat of the old school, had shown himself\r\nvery much alarmed at the victories and conquests of the Hohenzollern; he\r\nwas ordered in all haste to St. Petersburg, and \"returned from there in\r\na few weeks entirely reassured, and affecting a satisfaction which was\r\nnot disturbed a single instant either by the reverses of the German\r\nprinces allied with the House of Russia, or by the developments which\r\nPrussia made in its military power.\"[75] Prince Gortchakof did not\r\nsacrifice to the old idols of the right of nations and of the balance of\r\npower; he did not share certain prejudices touching the \"solidarity\r\nwhich should exist among all the conservative interests;\" and he had too\r\nlofty a soul to be jealous of a good neighbor. Moreover, had he not too\r\n\"vanquished Europe,\" three years previously, in the memorable campaign\r\nof Poland? Some august personages, some princesses and grand duchesses,\r\nhad said in vain, with the women of the Bible, that Saul killed his\r\nthousands, but David tens of thousands; they had in vain showed their\r\ndespoiled relations and their confiscated patrimonies; Alexander\r\nMikhailovitch did not envy the young laurels of his former colleague of\r\nFrankfort, become Chancellor of the Confederation of the North. He\r\nrejoiced in seeing Austria severely punished and France well mortified;\r\nfor the rest, he thought that nothing was changed, and that there was\r\nonly one more great chancellor in this century.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[39] See the celebrated circular dispatch of M. de Bismarck of the 24th\r\nJanuary, 1863, in which he gives an account of the curious interviews\r\nwhich he had with the ambassador of Austria, Count Karolyi, in the last\r\nmonths of the year 1862, soon after his accession to power.\r\n\r\n[40] \"Why, then, should not representative institutions be accorded at\r\nthe same time to the kingdom of Poland and to the empire of\r\nRussia?\"--Dispatch of Lord John Russell to Lord Napier, 10th April,\r\n1863.\r\n\r\n[41] \"This _connivance_ of Austria was not the least remarkable event in\r\nthe history of this insurrection.\"--Confidential dispatch of M. de\r\nTengoborski to M. d'Oubril, 4th February, 1863.\r\n\r\n[42] \"The Polish insurrection, on which its duration impressed a\r\nnational character,\" the Emperor Napoleon III. said in his speech of the\r\n5th November, 1863.\r\n\r\n[43] \"On former occasions, M. de Bismarck always spoke to me of the\r\nprobability that the Russian army would be too weak to suppress the\r\ninsurrection.\"--Dispatch of Sir A.

Inclosure.\r\nMinute of conversation between M. de Bismarck and Sir A.

Drouyn de\r\nLhuys, become prudent, and with reason would not send his note until\r\nafter that of England had reached Prince Gortchakof. Lord Russell then\r\nwrote his dispatch; it was read at the council, approved by Lord\r\nPalmerston, and a copy of it was given to the minister of foreign\r\naffairs of France. Lord Napier had already been advised to inform Prince\r\nGortchakof of an \"important communication\" which he would soon have the\r\nhonor to transmit to him, and the Duke of Montebello was also instructed\r\nby the French government to support his colleague of Great Britain in\r\nhis solemn declaration; already the debated document had left for its\r\ndestination, and was on its way to St. Petersburg, ... when suddenly, and\r\nto the unspeakable astonishment of the persons initiated, a telegram\r\nbrusquely stopped in Germany the bearer of the note; another telegram\r\ninformed Lord Napier that no further attention should be given to the\r\n\"important communication.\" For during the interval Count Bernstorff had\r\nread at the foreign office a Prussian dispatch in which M. de Bismarck\r\nadvised the principal secretary of state to take care how he\r\nproceeded,--for, if the czar were declared deprived of his rights over\r\nPoland for his violation of the treaty of Vienna, the German governments\r\ncould also declare on their part the King of Denmark deprived of his\r\nsovereignty over the Duchies of the Elbe for not having fulfilled all\r\nthe engagements of the treaty of London. Lord John Russell recalled the\r\ncourier and tore up the note.--_Vide_ in the _Revue des deux Mondes_ of\r\nthe 1st January, 1865, \"Two Negotiations of Contemporaneous Diplomacy;\r\nM. de Bismarck and the Northern Alliance.\"\r\n\r\n[47] \"In 1848 Denmark had demanded the protection of France; M.

Summoned by the\r\nconference of London to present his pretensions, M. de Bismarck (28th\r\nMay, 1864) could not do otherwise than to follow Austria, and to\r\npronounce himself for the Duke of Augustenburg. The 2d June, at the\r\nreunion succeeding the conference (the telegraph had had time to work),\r\nthe Russian plenipotentiary declared unexpectedly that the emperor, his\r\naugust master, \"desiring to facilitate as far as he could the\r\narrangements to be concluded,\" had ceded his eventual rights, as chief\r\nof the House Holstein-Gottorp, to his relative, ... the Grand Duke of\r\nOldenburg! The 18th June, another relative of the Emperor Alexander II.,\r\nPrince Frederick William of Hesse, also asserted his rights to the\r\nsuccession at the conference of London. This is an example of the\r\nnumerous and discreet services which Prince Gortchakof knew how to\r\nrender to his friend of Berlin in the sad campaign of the Duchies.\r\n\r\n[51] Verse of a German song.\r\n\r\n[52] We have taken care to preserve in the translation the character of\r\nedifying obscurity which distinguishes the original.\r\n\r\n[53] \"What can one say now, if France had shown itself opposed to these\r\nproceedings (the treaty of Italy with Prussia), we could not run the\r\nrisk of finding ourselves face to face with an Austro-Franco alliance.\r\nPrussia was as solicitous as we, perhaps even more, with the attitude\r\nwhich France would take in case of a war of Prussia and Italy against\r\nAustria.\"--La Marmora, _Un po piu di luce_, p. 80.

Leaning his\r\nelbow on a writing table, on which \"two bottles with candles in their\r\nnecks did service as lights,\"[76] M. de Bismarck had asked M. Thiers for\r\npermission to smoke a cigar, while he rested from the negotiations\r\npursued during the whole day concerning the armistice and the peace, and\r\nentered into a conversation full of _abandon_ and gossip on the events\r\nof the war. Among other things he related that the Emperor Napoleon\r\nIII., having retired to a little garden after the capitulation of Sedan,\r\ngrew pale at seeing him arrive armed with two pistols in his belt: \"He\r\nthought me capable of an action in bad taste.\" One would scarcely be\r\ndeceived in supposing that the man who since the attack of Blind had\r\nnot ceased to show a very nervous solicitude for his person,[77]\r\nattributed here in this circumstance, and surely very ungenerously, to\r\nthe unhappy monarch sentiments which were far from his mind. However\r\nthat may be, the Prussian minister took pleasure during whole hours in\r\nthe reminiscences and stories in which he showed all his brilliancy of\r\nmind; and on his part M. Thiers, scarcely returned from that journey of\r\nforty days, during which he had twice crossed Europe and negotiated with\r\nso many sovereigns and ministers, was not behind hand with _piquant_\r\nanecdotes and ingenious ideas. He thought, however, that it was\r\nnecessary to recall, after some time, the serious matters which brought\r\nhim to the head-quarters; but M. de Bismarck,--this \"savage full of\r\ngenius,\" as the French statesman soon called him in his effusions at the\r\nbishop's palace at Orleans,--seemed to wish to prolong as much as\r\npossible a delightful chat, and, taking the hand of M. Thiers, he cried\r\nout, \"Allow me, I beg of you; allow me, it is so pleasant to be a little\r\nwhile with civilization!\" The _civilization_, allowed at last to plead\r\nhis cause anew, did not the less find the old \"iron count\" in the\r\naffable and fluent talker of a few moments before: the arts had\r\ndecidedly in no respect softened the political manners of the _savage_.\r\nThen M. Thiers remembered the favorable disposition which he had found\r\nin Russia, and he thought it useful to make the most of it in a moment\r\nso critical. During his sojourn at St. Petersburg, he had addressed to\r\nthe delegation of Tours a telegraphic dispatch singularly hopeful. \"He\r\nhad every cause,\" he said, \"to be very much satisfied with his reception\r\nby the emperor, the imperial family, Prince Gortchakof, and the other\r\ndignitaries as well as with that of Russian society in general. The\r\nemperor and his chancellor had expressed themselves warmly against the\r\nexorbitant conditions of peace laid down by Prussia; they had declared\r\nthat Russia would never give its consent to conditions which were not\r\nequitable; that, in consequence, the consent of the other Powers would\r\nlikewise be wanting; the exactions of Prussia would only be from the\r\neffect of force, and would not rest on any sanction.\"[78] Without\r\nentering into such developments, M. Thiers spoke this time in general\r\nterms of the marks of solicitude which \"his friend Prince Gortchakof\"\r\nhad given him, and ended by stating that Russia had become alarmed and\r\nirritated. At these words, M. de Bismarck got up and rang: \"Bring the\r\nportfolio that contains the papers of Russia.\" The portfolio having been\r\nbrought, \"Read,\" said he; \"here are thirty letters from St. Petersburg.\"\r\nM. Thiers did not fail to profit by the permission: he read, he\r\nunderstood, and he was disabused.\r\n\r\nYet, it would not have been difficult for the illustrious historian of\r\nthe Consulate and the Empire to have spared himself this cruel\r\ndeception, to have avoided, also, more than one false step in his rapid\r\ncourse across Europe, if he had only wished to consult competent men or\r\neven paid them the least attention. M. de Beust, for instance, was\r\nperfectly able to enlighten him on the real relations between Russia and\r\nPrussia; but it was especially M. Benedetti who could have told him the\r\nprecise and already old date of the understanding agreed upon by the two\r\ncourts of Berlin and St. Petersburg in view of a war with France, as\r\nwell as the very extraordinary circumstances which had accompanied this\r\nunderstanding. Let us briefly recall here those circumstances,\r\nendeavoring to free them as much as possible from certain obscurities\r\nwith which the interested parties continue to surround them, and let us\r\nreturn once more to the day after Sadowa, to the public or secret\r\ntransactions which followed this dreadful day. The greater part of the\r\npolitical combinations which were to be so fatal to France in the war of\r\n1870, were contrived and consolidated during that equally gloomy and\r\nturbulent period, during the two months of July and August of the year\r\n1866.\r\n\r\n\"None of the questions which touch us can be solved without the consent\r\nof France,\" the Emperor Napoleon III. had declared the 11th June, 1866,\r\nin a solemn document produced before the legislative body; and among\r\nthose questions any \"modification of the map of Europe to the exclusive\r\nprofit of a great Power\" was naturally placed in the first rank. But,\r\nusing that equally immense as unhoped-for victory of the 3d July, 1866,\r\nPrussia intended changing the map to its exclusive profit. In place of\r\n\"maintaining for Austria its great position in Germany,\" as the imperial\r\nletter of the 11th June had demanded, Prussia demanded that the empire\r\nof the Hapsburg should be totally excluded from the Germanic\r\nConfederation; in place of according to the secondary States \"a more\r\nimportant _role_, a more powerful organization,\" it aspired to the\r\ncomplete hegemony over all Germany, and furthermore wished to complete\r\nlarge annexations in the countries occupied by its troops. In fomenting\r\nthis war which was to end in such unforeseen results, the imperial\r\npolicy had above all pursued two ends,--the affranchisement of Venice,\r\nand the equitable settlement of affairs in Germany. Venice was ceded,\r\nceded even before the commencement of hostilities, and in accepting this\r\ncession, in announcing in the \"Moniteur\" this \"important event\" after\r\nthe great disaster of General Benedeck, the Emperor Napoleon, in the\r\njudgment of his minister of foreign affairs, was the more bound not to\r\nallow Austria and its allies to be overwhelmed as it concerned the vital\r\ninterests of France itself. The minister demanded, in consequence, his\r\naugust master to convoke the legislative body, to send to the frontier\r\nof the East an army of observation of 80,000 men whom Marshal Randon\r\nwould bring together very quickly, and to declare to Prussia that they\r\nwould occupy the left bank of the Rhine, if it was not moderate in its\r\ndemands towards the vanquished, and if it realized territorial\r\nacquisitions of a nature to destroy the equilibrium of Europe.\r\n\r\nAssuredly, after the terrible experiences of the year 1870, these very\r\nlegitimate doubts as to the efficaciousness of the measures proposed by\r\nM. Drouyn de Lhuys in the month of July, 1866, can be raised; it is\r\nnevertheless well to remember that the prestige of France was still\r\ngreat and almost intact; that in a week Austria could bring back from\r\nItaly 120,000 or 130,000 soldiers still fresh from the victory of\r\nCustozza, and that the troops of General Moltke already began to\r\nexperience the natural consequences of the whole war, although\r\nfortunate. \"Prussia is victorious,\" wrote the ambassador of France at\r\nthe court of Vienna, \"but it is exhausted. From the Rhine to Berlin\r\nthere are not 15,000 men to be met with. You can be master of the\r\nsituation by means of a simple military demonstration, and you can do it\r\nin all security, for Prussia is incapable at this moment of accepting a\r\nwar with France. Let the emperor make a simple military demonstration,\r\nand he will be astonished at the facility with which he will become,\r\nwithout striking a blow, arbiter and master of the situation.\" In the\r\nconfidential letters addressed by M. de Bismarck to his wife during this\r\ncampaign, there are some traces of anxiety which at this moment assailed\r\nhis mind, especially of his efforts to talk sense to the overexcited,\r\n\"to the good people who do not see farther than their noses, _and swim\r\nat their ease on the foaming wave of the phrase_.\" Six days after\r\nSadowa, on the way to Vienna, he wrote from Hohenmauth: \"Do you still\r\nremember, my heart, that we passed by here nineteen years ago, in going\r\nfrom Prague to Vienna? No mirror then showed us the future, neither did\r\nit in 1852, when I crossed this iron line with the good Lynar!... As for\r\nus, all is well, and we will have a peace which is worth something, if\r\nwe do not exaggerate our demands and do not think that we have conquered\r\nthe world. Unfortunately we are as quick to get drunk as to despair, and\r\nI have the unthankful task of pouring water in the foaming wine, and to\r\nshow that _we are not alone in Europe_ and that we have three\r\nneighbors.\" Lastly, in his celebrated speech of the 16th January, 1874,\r\nin the Reichstag, the chancellor of Germany, in speaking of those\r\ndecisive days, made the important avowal, that, \"if France had then had\r\nonly a few available troops, a small body of French troops would have\r\nsufficed to make quite a respectable army by joining the numerous corps\r\nof South Germany, which on their part could furnish excellent materials\r\nwhose organization alone was defective. Such an army _would have first\r\nplaced us in the prime necessity of covering Berlin, and of abandoning\r\nall our successes in Austria_.\" Let us add to that that Germany was\r\nstill effervescent against the \"fratricidal\" policy of Prussia, that the\r\nproceedings and the exactions of Generals Vogel de Falkenstein and\r\nManteuffel had exasperated the minds of all on the banks of the Main:\r\nthere was a single instant, very fleeting also, it is true, when the\r\nappearance of the French on the Rhine would not have wounded the\r\nTeutonic susceptibilities, would have even been saluted with joy!\r\n\"Sire,\" said to the Emperor Napoleon III. one of the most eminent\r\nministers of the Germanic Confederation,--\"sire, a simple military\r\ndemonstration on your part can save Europe, and Germany will also\r\npreserve an eternal recollection of it. If you let this moment pass, _in\r\nfour years from now_ you will be forced to make war against Prussia, and\r\nthen you will have all Germany against you.\"\r\n\r\nBut the fright caused by the prodigious victories of Prussia was too\r\ngreat in the Tuileries to allow the preservation of the _sang froid_\r\nwhich the circumstances so imperiously demanded. The needle gun was also\r\na revelation which, by turns, exalted or depreciated beyond measure by\r\nauthorities reputed competent, contributed not a little to increase the\r\nperplexities springing up on all sides; lastly, doubts arose even as to\r\nthe possibility of getting together the 80,000 men of whom the minister\r\nof war spoke. The fatal expedition to Mexico had swallowed up almost all\r\nthe arms, and almost all the troops of France! They were forced to make\r\nthe strange avowal that they had desired with ardor, favored, provoked\r\nthe greatest European complications without even asking if, at the\r\ncritical and foreseen moment of the rupture of the equilibrium of the\r\nworld, they would be in a condition to make even a simple military\r\ndemonstration. The _party of action_ in the councils of the empire would\r\nthen have had a good chance to praise Prussia as the powerful agent of\r\ncivilization and progress, to rise against the tendencies, always\r\nAustrian, of the bureaux of the Quai d'Orsay, and to recommend more than\r\never an alliance with M. de Bismarck: it was necessary to give him\r\n_carte blanche_ in Germany, and to complete French unity in acquiring\r\nBelgium. M. Drouyn de Lhuys did not take the trouble to demonstrate the\r\ninanity, the temerity of such suggestions, and he asked, not without\r\nbitterness, how France, which they declared incapable of placing on foot\r\neven a corps of observation on the Rhine, would be strong enough to\r\nattack Antwerp, provoke England, and end by probably arraying against\r\nitself all the Powers of Europe, among whom Prussia would not be the\r\nlast? He was not behind hand in recriminations; he showed the officious\r\nand culpable zeal which had been used in order to incite war, the\r\nconsequences of which he, for his part, had never ceased to dread, as\r\nthey had taken care to place no limit to the _license_ allowed to one of\r\nthe parties, the most redoubtable, the most skillful, and from which it\r\nwas most essential to take sureties in advance. On the side from which\r\nit was never threatened, it had neglected no precaution; in case of the\r\nvictory of Austria, Venetia would have nevertheless been acquired by\r\nItaly. \"In my opinion,\" ingenuously added the minister, \"in a French\r\npoint of view it is a bad result; but the emperor insisted on it, above\r\nall, and I have procured it for him.\" It was certainly the least that\r\ncould be asked, he thought, that they should allow him to obtain, on the\r\nother hand, compensations, _French this time_, which alone could justify\r\nbefore the nation the kindnesses shown to Prussia.\r\n\r\nThe debates were long and very violent for several days, and different\r\ninfluences worked in the most opposite directions. The party of the\r\n_Palais Royal_ was not the only one, however, to preach the abandonment\r\nof the conqueror of Sadowa; in a certain measure it found its adherents\r\namong statesmen the most moderate in their opinions, and ordinarily the\r\nmost calm in their judgments. M. Rouher was one of the first to oppose\r\nany armed demonstration on the Eastern frontier, and soon we even hear\r\nhim speak of a _necessary and fruitful_ alliance between France and\r\nPrussia! \"Austria,\" thought another important member of the privy\r\ncouncil, \"only inspires to-day that interest, so near to indifference,\r\nwhich one feels for the strong become weak through their fault, not\r\nhaving foreseen or prepared themselves. _Up to the present time, all is\r\nfor the best!_\"[79] While M. Magne thus pronounced the _vae victis_ on\r\nthe empire of the Hapsburg,--without thinking that four years later,\r\nalas! Europe would use almost the same expressions in regard to France\r\nitself,--an august woman, a sister of the King of Wuertemberg, and a near\r\nrelative of the imperial family of France, used different language. \"You\r\ncherish strange illusions,\" said she; \"your prestige has diminished more\r\nin these last two weeks than during the whole duration of your reign.\r\nYou allow the weak to be destroyed, you let the insolence and brutality\r\nof your nearest neighbor grow beyond measure; you accept a gift, and you\r\ndo not even know how to address a kind word to him who gives it. I\r\nregret that you do not believe me disinterested in the question, and\r\nthat you do not see the fatal danger of _a_ powerful Germany and _a_\r\npowerful Italy. The _dynasty_ is menaced, and it will suffer the\r\nconsequences. Do not believe that the misfortune which overwhelms me in\r\nthe disaster of my country makes me unjust or distrustful. Venice ceded,\r\nit would be necessary to succor Austria, to march to the Rhine, impose\r\nyour conditions! To let Austria be slaughtered is more than a crime, it\r\nis an error!\" Error or crime, the decision on this point had been\r\nalready reached, before this warm appeal from the Queen of Holland\r\nreached the Tuileries.[80] Napoleon III. was very ill at this epoch,\r\nstruggling against the first advances of a cruel disease which never\r\nforsook him,--in consequence less than ever inclined to vigorous\r\nresolutions; and, on the 10th July, after a grand council of ministers\r\nheld at Paris in presence of the emperor, the Prince de Metternich was\r\nobliged to telegraph to Vienna that France would only interfere in the\r\nconflict through its diplomats.\r\n\r\nYet there was something more efficacious, more loyal in any case, in\r\ntrying only a vain isolated mediation, full of perilous reticence and\r\nselfish calculations: that was simply to agree on a harmony of action\r\namong the Powers on a question certainly eminently \"European,\" and which\r\ninterested the equilibrium of the world in so high a degree. A word from\r\nFrance in the sense indicated \"would certainly have been listened to,\"\r\nto borrow an expression from the imperial letter of the 11th June, for\r\nit was Prince Gortchakof himself who spoke at this moment of the\r\nnecessity of a general congress.[81] Threatened with the first and\r\nviolent commotion caused by the sudden undermining of Austria at the\r\nsight of so many relations and cousins of his august master menaced with\r\nspoliation and ruin, the Russian chancellor had in truth given this true\r\ndescription of the situation. So devoted as he was to his former\r\ncolleague of Frankfort, so fascinated by his genius, Alexander\r\nMikhailovitch had not yet sufficiently cast aside the old Adam, the\r\n_attache_ of the suite of Count Nesselrode at the reunions of Laybach\r\nand Verona, to admit in a trice that such a considerable transformation\r\nof the public right could be effected without the knowledge of Europe\r\nand without its consent. Why did the cabinet of the Tuileries not\r\nappreciate the solution offered by the Russian chancellor? Why did it\r\nnot try to provoke a concerted action of the Powers in view of an\r\noverturning so menacing for the balance of the states? Why did it not\r\nsee that in treating separately with M. de Bismarck it only made the\r\ngame for the conqueror? In spite of all his triumphs, even in spite of\r\nall his audacity, the Prussian minister would have been slightly\r\nembarrassed in asking before the areopagus of the Powers for the almost\r\ncomplete abolition of the treaties of 1815, the dethronement of the old\r\nHouse of the Guelphs, or the expulsion of the empire of the Hapsburg\r\nfrom the bosom of Germany; and one will see in the sequel the cleverness\r\nwhich he used in escaping from such a necessity and in making France an\r\naccomplice in the eclipse of Europe. Strange fatality of the Napoleonic\r\nideology! The dreamer of Ham had passed all his reign in proposing\r\ncongresses, in invoking them at the most inopportune moments, under the\r\nleast propitious circumstances, and he neglected to apply this panacea,\r\nso celebrated and recommended, on the only occasion where it was\r\ndemanded by good sense and good right, in the only crisis in which it\r\ncould become useful and salutary! The not less surprising good luck of\r\nthe minister of William I., who was \"saved from the congress,\" according\r\nto the _mot_ of Count d'Usedom, and saved on two occasions in the space\r\nof some weeks: in the month of June, thanks to the kindness of Prince\r\nGortchakof, and in the month of July, thanks to the infatuation of\r\nFrance! They were not ignorant at the Tuileries of the desire manifested\r\nin a moment of happy inspiration by Alexander Mikhailovitch; but the\r\ntreaties of 1815 had been so eloquently \"cursed\" in the speech of\r\nAuxerre, they had announced with so much noise the \"important event\" of\r\nVenice and had illuminated Paris! As always, they clung to the\r\n_prestige_, to the glory of appearing as the \"Neptune of Virgil,\" in the\r\neyes of the profane, and they hoped more than ever to obtain some good\r\nGod-send by again obliging the \"Piedmont of Germany.\" Consequently M.\r\nBenedetti received the order to present himself at the head-quarters in\r\nMoravia, to offer to M. de Bismarck French mediation, and to \"sound\"\r\nhim on the advantages that in justice he could scarcely fail to accord\r\nto the ardent mediator.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more curious than the language used by the minister of\r\nPrussia to the ambassador of France at those first conversations in\r\nMoravia! M. de Bismarck began by renewing the fantasies of Biarritz, and\r\nit was the very opposite of a Tilsit who appeared to form plans at the\r\nhead-quarters at Bruenn: the son of Frederick William III., conquered at\r\nJena, seemed to wish to offer to the nephew of Napoleon I. to share the\r\nworld with him, to share it to the detriment of Russia and England! \"He\r\nendeavored to prove to me,\" wrote M. Benedetti on the 15th July, \"that\r\nthe reverses of Austria allowed France and Prussia to modify their\r\nterritorial situation, and to solve at the present time the greater part\r\nof the difficulties which will continue to menace the peace of Europe. I\r\nreminded him that treaties existed, and that the war which he desired to\r\nprevent would be the first result of such a policy. M. de Bismarck\r\nanswered me, that I misunderstood, that France and Prussia, united and\r\nresolved to remodel their respective frontiers by binding one another by\r\nsolemn engagements, were henceforward in a position to regulate together\r\nthese questions, without fear of meeting an armed resistance _either on\r\nthe part of England or on the part of Russia_.\" In other words,--and\r\nthese words were likewise employed in the report of M. Benedetti,--the\r\nPrussian minister believed that \"he could free himself from the\r\nobligation to submit to the control of Europe,\" thanks to a separate\r\nagreement with France. As to the means to bring about this precious\r\nagreement, it was perfectly simple: France had only to seek its fortune\r\nalong the Meuse and the Escaut. \"I do not tell your excellency anything\r\nnew,\" wrote M. Benedetti to his chief, some days after, from Nikolsburg,\r\nin announcing to him that M. de Bismarck was of the opinion \"that we\r\nshould seek compensation in Belgium, and that he offered to act in\r\nconcert with us.\" He did not, however, utterly repel the idea of giving\r\nFrance its share on the Rhine, not, for instance, in the Prussian\r\nterritories, where it would be difficult to persuade King William to\r\nrenounce any portion of his possession; \"but something could perhaps be\r\nfound in the Palatinate,\" that is, in Bavaria. He was always \"much more\r\nPrussian than German,\" and reasonable terms could be made with the\r\nWalhalla.\r\n\r\nThe French government fell into the trap which was thus set, and it then\r\naided Prussia in _freeing itself from all control of Europe_, in working\r\nat these preliminaries of Nikolsburg, signed the 26th July, and which\r\nsealed the exclusion of Austria from Germany, and constituted a\r\nconfederation of the North, under the hegemony of the Hohenzollern. This\r\ngrave attack on public right and the equilibrium of the world once\r\nconceded, and the war virtually ended, one began to talk of\r\ncompensations. In a letter addressed to M. de Goltz, and dated from Vichy\r\nthe 3d August, M. Drouyn de Lhuys declared that the emperor, his august\r\nmaster, \"had not wished to complicate the difficulties of a work of\r\n_European interest_ in treating _prematurely_ with Prussia\" on\r\nterritorial questions; but the moment seemed finally come to consider\r\nthese questions, all the more as they were preparing to obtain large\r\nannexations north of the Main. \"The king,\" M. de Bismarck had written to\r\nM. de Goltz the 10th July,--\"the king cares less for the constitution of\r\na political northern confederation, and _above all desires annexations_;\r\nhe would rather abdicate than return without an important territorial\r\nacquisition.\"[82] In fact, besides the Duchies of the Elbe, the\r\nabandonment of which had been stipulated at Nikolsburg, Prussia still\r\nwished to absorb the free cities, Cassel, Hanover, even Saxony, and at\r\nthe Tuileries they hoped to measure the French demands according to the\r\nnumber of souls and of square leagues that William the Conqueror should\r\ndemand for himself. \"The great war for German nationality,\" which the\r\npopular Caesar had recommended at Biarritz, turned in a measure into \"this\r\nhuman cattle market,\" so blamed at the congress of Vienna, at the\r\n\"execrated\" treaties of 1815,--and how is it possible not to acknowledge\r\nthat France played a _role_ there unworthy of itself? It was for it to\r\ndeny at once the new and the old right, the principle of national will as\r\nwell as that of the legitimacy of princes; it wished, moreover, to\r\nrealize an illicit gain and a paltry sum on the occasion of a great\r\nuniversal calamity, and, to speak with the English humorist, to profit by\r\nthe eruption of Vesuvius to boil an egg! M. de Bismarck uttered at this\r\nmoment a cruel _mot_, but which was not entirely unmerited. \"France,\"\r\nsaid he to a former minister of the Germanic Confederation,--\"France\r\n_follows a Trinkgeld policy_ (_la France fait une politique de\r\npour-boire_).\"\r\n\r\nA letter written by M. Rouher on the 6th August, 1866, and since found\r\namong the papers of the Tuileries,[83] makes us see the strange\r\nillusions which the French government then cherished, and the ambassador\r\nof Prussia at Paris did his best to sustain. \"M. de Goltz finds our\r\npretension legitimate in principle,\" wrote the minister of state; \"he\r\nconsiders that satisfaction ought to be given to the only wish of our\r\ncountry to constitute between France and Prussia _a necessary and\r\nfruitful alliance_.\" The embarrassment is solely to determine the sum of\r\nthe demands that should be put forward. \"The empress would demand much\r\nor nothing, in order not to compromise our final pretensions.\" As for M.\r\nRouher, he thinks that \"public opinion would have _food_ and\r\n_direction_, if to-morrow we could say officially, Prussia consents that\r\nwe retake the frontiers of 1814, and thus efface the consequences of\r\nWaterloo.\" Let it be well understood, the minister of state does not\r\nadmit \"that this rectification would serve as a receipt for the future!\"\r\n\"Without doubt, new facts must develop in order that new pretensions\r\narise, but these facts will certainly be developed. Germany is only in\r\nthe first of those numerous oscillations which it will undergo before\r\nfinding its new position. Let us be more ready, in the future, to better\r\nprofit by events; opportunities will not be wanting. The States south of\r\nthe Main, especially, will be, in a few years from now, an apple of\r\ndiscord or a matter for a compromise. M. de Goltz does not dissimulate\r\nat present the covetousness as regards this group of confederates.\"\r\nThus, at the very moment that they boasted of \"saving\" the States of the\r\nSouth, of establishing on the other side of the Rhine a new political\r\ncombination which the minister of state was soon to adorn with the\r\nfamous name of _three fragments_, and to declare, marvelously reassuring\r\nfor France, they already waited for an opportunity to abandon this\r\ncombination, and to traffic for it \"at a reasonable price!\"\r\n\r\nHow naive to think that after Sadowa and Nikolsburg, the ruin of Austria\r\nconsummated, Germany completely subjected, all intervention of Europe\r\nchecked, and the military weakness of France proclaimed to all the\r\nwinds,[84] that one would find Prussia accessible to those arrangements\r\nwhich it had not wished to make before its immense victories, at the\r\nmoment of its greatest perplexities, and in the midst of the anguish of\r\na crisis which all the world agreed in proclaiming perilous in the\r\nextreme! Even on the 8th June, on the eve of the war, M. Benedetti thus\r\nsummed up the state of public opinion in Prussia in regard to France:\r\n\"The apprehensions which we inspire everywhere in Germany still exist,\r\nand they will awaken unanimously and violently at the least sign which\r\nwould allow our intention of enlarging our boundaries towards the East\r\nto be guessed. The king, like the most humble of his subjects, would not\r\nbear at this moment the suggestion of the probability of a sacrifice on\r\nthe Rhine. The crown prince, so profoundly convinced of the dangers of\r\nthe policy of which he is the witness, declared, not long ago, to one of\r\nmy colleagues, with extreme vivacity, that he preferred war to cession,\r\nif it was only the little county of Glatz.\"[85] And it was the same\r\ndiplomat who had so appreciated the situation before the campaign of\r\nBohemia, it was this same ambassador who now took upon himself to\r\npresent to M. de Bismarck the demands of the cabinet of the Tuileries,\r\nwho even submitted to him on the 5th August a project for a secret\r\ntreaty, implying the abandonment to France of all the left bank of the\r\nRhine, without excepting the great fortress of Mayence! \"In view of the\r\nimportant acquisitions which the peace assures to the Prussian\r\ngovernment,\" said M. Benedetti, \"I was of the opinion that a territorial\r\nremodeling would hereafter be necessary for our security; I have\r\ninstigated nothing, I have still less guaranteed the success; I have\r\nonly allowed myself to hope for it, provided that our language were firm\r\nand our attitude resolute.\" Was firmness wanting, or was too much of it\r\nshown? In any case, M. de Bismarck asserts that he replied in a tone\r\nwhich certainly showed no irresolution. \"Very well,\" he replied to the\r\npressing entreaties of the ambassador, \"then we will have war. But let\r\nhis majesty well observe, that such a war could become in certain\r\neventualities _a_ war with a revolution, and that in presence of\r\nrevolutionary dangers, the German dynasties would prove to be much more\r\nfirmly established than that of Napoleon.\"[86]\r\n\r\nThat was not, however, the last remark of the Prussian minister.\r\nPerfectly decided not to admit the discussion on the subject of the\r\nRhine, he took care, nevertheless, not to completely discourage the\r\nFrench ambassador, and to continue a game with him which later, in his\r\ncircular of the 29th July, 1870, he called by the name, unknown until\r\nthen in the diplomatic dictionary, of _dilatory negotiations_. He spoke\r\nof his liking for Napoleon III., of his great ambition to solve in\r\nconcert with him the important problems of the future. \"Prussia needs an\r\nalliance with a great Power;\" that was his inmost conviction; he did not\r\ncease to preach it to the king his august master,--and what alliance\r\nmore desirable, in a point of view of progress and of civilization, than\r\nthat with the French empire? He thus returned to his recent effusions of\r\nBruenn and Nikolsburg; he insinuated \"that _other arrangements_ could be\r\nmade which would satisfy the respective interests of the two\r\ncountries,\"[87] and he strengthened M. Benedetti in his design to return\r\nto Paris and to expose the situation.\r\n\r\nAt Paris the conflict of Powers was carried on with vigor between the\r\nminister of foreign affairs and the ambassador of Prussia, M. de Goltz,\r\nably seconded by the _party of action_, to which the arrival of M.\r\nBenedetti (11th August) brought considerable support. M. Drouyn de Lhuys\r\nwas not at all surprised at the _Prussian ingratitude_, as M. Benedetti\r\nhad expressed it in one of his last dispatches,[88] but, by a logic\r\nwhich escapes us, he did not the less rejoice at seeing the French\r\ndemands at last stated, \"They can be taken up again in good time.\" He\r\nhad no doubt of the use that they would soon make on the banks of the\r\nSpree of the project of the treaty of the 5th August! He hoped, besides,\r\nthat the final refusal given at Berlin would cause the ardent promoters\r\nof dangerous intrigues to reflect that it would prevent certain\r\nengagements for the future which he apprehended above all. M. de Goltz\r\nsuddenly told him that he had come to an agreement with the emperor\r\nconcerning the annexations to be effected by William I. in Northern\r\nGermany, and a letter addressed the 12th August by the chief of state to\r\nthe Marquis de La Valette cut short all controversy with Prussia. \"It\r\nresults from my conversation with Benedetti,\" wrote Napoleon III. to the\r\nminister of the interior, \"that we will have all Germany against us for\r\na small profit; it is important not to let public opinion be mistaken on\r\nthis point.\" The misfortune was only that the imperial government\r\nallowed itself at this moment to be misled on a very dangerous point,\r\nand that Belgium became for it, from that time, the object of a\r\nnegotiation as deceptive as fatal, and from which later, at the\r\nbeginning of the war of 1870, it in vain endeavored to elude the\r\ncrushing responsibility.\r\n\r\nThat M. de Bismarck was, from the beginning, the great tempter of the\r\nimperial government, and the tempter repulsed even for a long time, in\r\nthese shadowy projects concerning the country of the Meuse and the\r\nEscaut, is a truth which to-day cannot be doubted, the authentic\r\ndocuments published lately suffice to convince the most incredulous\r\nmind. It was not only in his conversations with General Govone that the\r\npresident of the Prussian council indicated on several occasions, and\r\nvery clearly, Belgium and certain parts of Switzerland as the most\r\nproper territories to \"indemnify France:\" long before the spring of the\r\nyear 1866, even long before the interview of Biarritz, M. de Bismarck\r\nhad tried to _sell the bear-skin_, as Napoleon III. said to him one day.\r\nGeneral La Marmora, who understood it a long time, adds that \"the bear\r\nwas neither in the Alps nor in the Carpathians; he was very well (_stava\r\nbenone_) and he neither wished to die nor to be caged up.\"[89] Such\r\nsuggestions were, without doubt, of a nature to startle the _party of\r\naction_ in the councils of the empire, they were, however, eagerly\r\nreceived by it; but scornfully checked, up to that point, by M. Drouyn\r\nde Lhuys, treated as \"projects of brigandage\" by the chief of the state,\r\nthey had to await that hour of _patriotic anguish_ which marked the\r\narrival of Benedetti, to be at last taken into serious consideration.\r\n\r\nCertainly the ambassador of France at the court of Berlin had, in this\r\nyear 1866, a very difficult and painful situation, we had almost said a\r\npathetic one. He had worked with ardor, with passion, to bring about\r\nthis _connubio_ of Italy and Prussia, which seemed to him to be an\r\nimmense good fortune for the imperial policy, a brilliant victory gained\r\nover the old order of things to the profit of the \"new right\" and\r\nNapoleonic ideas. In the fear, very well founded besides, of seeing this\r\nwork miscarry and Prussia draw back, if one spoke to it of eventual\r\ncompensations and preventive engagements, he had not ceased to dissuade\r\nhis government from any attempt of this kind, and to lay stress upon the\r\nfierce, intractable, and suspicious patriotism of the House of\r\nHohenzollern, even to the point of being sometimes suspected at the\r\nHotel of the Quai d'Orsay of somewhat exaggerating the colors, and of\r\nmaking a certain devil blacker and more German than he really was. The\r\nwork had at last succeeded; succeeded beyond all expectations; succeeded\r\nin inspiring fear, in suddenly convincing M. Benedetti \"that a\r\nterritorial remodeling was henceforth necessary to the security of\r\nFrance.\" This remodeling he had flattered himself for a moment with\r\nhaving obtained on the Rhine: \"He had not guaranteed the success, but he\r\nhad allowed himself to _hope_ for it.\" Refused with firmness, if not\r\nwith pride, \"and having taken the measure of Prussian ingratitude,\" he\r\nwas nevertheless soon given to hope what the minister of William I. had\r\ninsinuated to him, \"that other proper arrangements could be made to\r\nsatisfy the respective interests of the two countries,\" and he had\r\ngrasped at the expedient which was thus pictured before his eyes, with\r\nso much the more feverish energy as he saw in it a new triumph for the\r\nmodern right and the principles dear to his party. Anxious to repair the\r\nconsequences of a policy to which for his part he had contributed more\r\nthan any other to make it successful; recognizing, however, the\r\ndifficulties, if not the impossibility, for the court of Berlin to cede\r\nany portion of the German soil, and always convinced of the sincere\r\ndesire of M. de Bismarck \"to indemnify France,\"[90] at this decisive\r\nhour he made himself, at the side of Napoleon III., the interpreter of\r\nthe ideas which he had gathered from the head-quarters at Bruenn, and\r\npleaded with warmth for this necessary and fruitful alliance with\r\nPrussia, which, extolled for a long time by the Palais Royal, had\r\nrecently deluded even the well balanced mind of M. Rouher.\r\n\r\nLet it be well understood, there was no question of immediate action, of\r\nwhich, indeed, the military situation of the country allowed no thought;\r\nthe question was simply of an agreement and a solidarity to be\r\nestablished for future eventualities, for the time more or less distant,\r\nbut inevitable, when Prussia should think of crowning its work, of\r\nfreeing the Main, of extending its rule from the Baltic to the\r\nAlps,--this question was of _boldly taking stand on the ground of\r\nnationalities_! \"If France boldly takes its stand on the ground of\r\nnationalities,\" said a curious note found among the papers of the\r\nTuileries, and which incontestably sums up the ideas of the party of\r\naction at this epoch,[91] \"it is necessary to establish now that there\r\nexists no Belgian nationality, and to fix this essential point with\r\nPrussia. As the cabinet of Berlin seemed to be, on the other hand,\r\ndisposed to enter with France into arrangements which would suit France,\r\nthere would be time to negotiate a secret act which should bind the two\r\nparties. Without pretending that this act was a perfectly sure\r\nguarantee, it would have the double advantage of compromising Prussia,\r\nand would be for it a gage of the sincerity of the policy or of the\r\nintentions of the Emperor.... To be certain of finding at Berlin a\r\nconfidence which is necessary for the maintenance of an intimate\r\nunderstanding, we must try to dissipate the apprehensions which have\r\nalways been entertained, which have been reawakened, and even\r\noverexcited by our last communications. This result cannot be obtained\r\nby words; an act is necessary, and one which will regulate the ulterior\r\nlot of Belgium in concert with Prussia, in proving at Berlin that the\r\nemperor seeks elsewhere than on the Rhine the extension necessary for\r\nFrance since the events of which Germany was the theatre. We must at\r\nleast have a relative certainty that the Prussian government will not\r\noppose our aggrandizement in the North.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIt was with the mission of negotiating a _secret act_, binding the two\r\nparties in the sense indicated by the note which we have just given,\r\nthat M. Benedetti left Paris towards the end of the month of August. The\r\nact was to provide for an offensive and defensive alliance between the\r\ntwo states, and, in exchange for the recognition of the changes already\r\naccomplished or still to be accomplished in Germany, to assure to\r\nNapoleon III. the diplomatic aid of Prussia for the acquisition of\r\nLuxemburg, and its _armed_ aid at the moment when France should judge it\r\nopportune to annex Belgium. Immediately on his arrival at his post the\r\nFrench ambassador went resolutely to work: he carried on the negotiation\r\n_without the knowledge of his immediate chief_, and only referred to the\r\nemperor and the minister of state.[92] He begged the president of the\r\ncouncil of Prussia to regard the propositions of the 5th August, those\r\nrelative to the left bank of the Rhine, as null and void, as a joke of\r\nM. Drouyn de Lhuys during the sickness of his august master, and\r\nsubmitted to him a new project in five articles concerning Belgium. It\r\nmatters little that the ambassador of France had with him the minute of\r\nit which he had written in the cabinet of the Prussian minister, at his\r\nrequest, and, \"in some measure at his dictation;\" it is certain that\r\nBenedetti acted according to the instructions from Paris,[93] and that\r\nM. de Bismarck on his part did not decline such overtures. He had even\r\nmade observations on some of the terms employed in the draft, and\r\ninsisted on introducing several changes in the text. The project thus\r\namended was sent to Paris, and returned anew to Berlin with\r\nrectifications made by the emperor and M. Rouher. On the banks of the\r\nSeine, in the councils of the small number initiated in the secret,\r\nthey were full of expectation and cheerfulness; they debated the\r\nquestion of the successor of M. Drouyn de Lhuys, and the opinions were\r\ndivided between M. La Valette and M. Benedetti; they exchanged ideas\r\nwhich were soon expressed in a sadly celebrated document, and they\r\nrejoiced at seeing \"the treaties of 1815 destroyed, the coalition of the\r\nthree Powers of the North broken, and Prussia made sufficiently\r\nindependent and sufficiently compact to ignore its former\r\ntraditions.\"[94] All of a sudden a discouraging dispatch from the\r\nambassador of France at the court of Berlin (29th August) troubled their\r\nminds, and they had again some apprehensions on the subject of the\r\n\"necessary and fruitful alliance\" which they flattered themselves with\r\nhaving established.\r\n\r\nThe conferences had continued up to the last days of the month of\r\nAugust, and M. de Bismarck had lent himself with good grace to the\r\n_dilatory negotiations_. In the mean time, the peace of Prague, the\r\ndefinite peace with Austria, was signed (26th August); the States of the\r\nSouth had adhered one after the other to the stipulations of Nikolsburg,\r\nand solemnly recognized the confederation of the North, as well as the\r\nterritorial acquisitions of Prussia. The secret act concerning Belgium\r\nwas in the hands of the minister of William I., and only needed to be\r\nfairly copied and signed, but at this moment M. Benedetti suddenly met\r\nwith strange inconceivable distrusts which did not fail to wound him\r\ndeeply. M. de Bismarck hesitated, spoke to him of his fears \"that the\r\nEmperor Napoleon would wish to make use of such a negotiation to create\r\nsuspicion between Prussia and England.\" The stupefaction of the French\r\nambassador was extreme. \"What degree of confidence can we on our side\r\naccord to those open to such suspicions?\" he asked in his dispatch of\r\nthe 29th August.[95] The proceeding seemed to him unjustifiable, and, in\r\norder not to be tempted to qualify it, he judged it opportune \"to go for\r\na fortnight to Carlsbad where he would hold himself ready to return to\r\nBerlin on receipt of the first telegram which M. de Bismarck should\r\naddress to him.\" Slightly moved at this circumstance, the court of the\r\nTuileries was not the less obstinate in believing in the _secret act_\r\nwhich was preparing at Berlin; it dismissed M. Drouyn de Lhuys, and long\r\nbefore the arrival of his successor from Constantinople, M. de Moustier,\r\nthey hastened to publish that famous circular of the 16th September,\r\nwhich bore the signature of the minister of the interior, M. de La\r\nValette, and was one more pledge given to the conqueror of Sadowa. The\r\nmanifest praised the theory of combinations and affirmed that \"Prussia,\r\nenlarged, free henceforth from any solidarity, would assure the\r\nindependence of Germany;\" as to the most secret hopes, scarcely an\r\nallusion was made to them: \"France can only desire territorial\r\naggrandizements which do not alter its powerful cohesion.\" Nothing\r\nhappened, however, and M. Benedetti waited in vain under the elms and\r\nthe beautiful firs of Carlsbad: M. de Bismarck gave no sign of life. He\r\nhad gone to Varzin, from whence he did not return until the month of\r\nDecember. The _dilatory negotiations_ had borne all their fruit in the\r\nmonth of August, and the French government would have been too happy if\r\nall those shadowy intrigues had remained for it only a simple deception:\r\nthey became its chastisement.\r\n\r\nM. de Benedetti had, however, pretended to know his man, to have\r\n_followed_ him for fifteen years! He had followed him in any case during\r\nthe negotiations of the spring which brought about the treaty between\r\nPrussia and Italy; he had then contemplated the magnificent tilt between\r\nthe _viper_ and the _charlatan_, and himself very judiciously judged a\r\nsituation in which the plenipotentiaries of the two countries had\r\nsurpassed one another in miracles of the true Punic faith. \"M. de\r\nBismarck and General Govone distrusted and still distrust one another,\"\r\nM. Benedetti wrote in his dispatch of the 27th of March, 1866. \"It is\r\nfeared at Florence that, finding itself in possession of _an act which\r\nplaces Italy in a certain degree at its discretion_, Prussia will make\r\nknown the stipulations of it at Vienna and will persuade the Austrian\r\ncabinet, by intimidation, to peacefully make the coveted concessions. At\r\nBerlin, they fear that Italy, if they promised to negotiate on these\r\nbases, will directly inform Austria before concluding any treaty, and\r\nwill thus try to obtain from it the abandonment of Venice.\" After a\r\nsimilar experience _in anima vili_, how could M. Benedetti have left on\r\nthe table of the president of the council of Berlin his compromising\r\nautograph on the subject of Belgium, _an act which in a certain degree\r\nplaced France at the mercy of Prussia_? How could he be astonished at\r\nseeing his interlocutor \"open to certain suspicion,\" and did he not on\r\nthe contrary make the same calculations for his own account and profit?\r\nIt was, however, very foolish to suppose that M. de Bismarck had the\r\nwill to do unto others that which he declared he did not wish others to\r\ndo unto him! And the ambassador of France would have scarcely been wrong\r\nin crediting this charitable thought to his interlocutor, however\r\nunevangelical, for the amusing or rather the sad part of the\r\naffair,--the true humor of all this imbroglio, as the Bardolph of\r\nShakspere would say,--is that the cavalier of the Mark had already\r\nexecuted precisely the manoeuvre, indifferently chivalric surely, of\r\nwhich he pretended to suspect Napoleon III., and that the thing was done\r\nat the moment when he demanded if they had nothing in their hands and\r\npockets. They had left in his hands two very secret and dangerous\r\ndocuments, the two plans of the treaties on the Rhine and Belgium,[96]\r\nand he took care not to avail himself of them immediately at the expense\r\nof the interested parties, whom he had every interest to attach to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe preliminaries of Nikolsburg, the reader will remember, had\r\nstipulated that the States of the South should remain outside of the new\r\nconfederation directed by Prussia, and that they should form among\r\nthemselves a restricted union. That was the great success obtained by\r\nthe French mediation, the salutary combination of the _three fragments_,\r\nmuch more favorable to the interests of France, according to its\r\nopinion, than that of the former _Bund_, the ill-omened creation of\r\n1815. It is true that among the persons initiated in the secret of\r\nBenedetti's mission, \"this group of confederates\" was only regarded as\r\n\"a matter of business for a reasonable profit;\" in waiting, however,\r\nthey \"saved\" the South, and M. Drouyn de Lhuys honestly exerted himself,\r\nin this month of August, 1866, to aid the unhappy plenipotentiaries of\r\nBavaria, of Wuertemberg, of Hesse, etc., who had gone to seek a definite\r\npeace at Berlin. M. de Bismarck had first frightened them by his fiscal\r\nand territorial demands; they had invoked and obtained the support of\r\nthe emperor, and in the Tuileries they flattered themselves with having\r\nin truth persuaded the minister of William I. to more equitable\r\nsentiments. Still, on the 24th August, M. Drouyn de Lhuys wrote to his\r\nagent in Bavaria: \"I am happy to think that our last step has not been\r\nwithout influence on the result of a negotiation which is ending in a\r\nmore satisfactory manner than the cabinet of Munich had at first thought\r\npossible;\" and it was not only M. Benedetti who took to himself in this\r\nmatter the credit of playing the fine _role_ of moderator.[97] The truth\r\nis, that if M. de Bismarck ended by becoming more moderate and even\r\namicable towards the Southern States, he had very different motives than\r\nthe desire of being agreeable to the cabinet of the Tuileries. He had\r\nsimply shown to \"the group of confederates\" the project of the treaty of\r\nthe 5th August; he had made them see that the French government, at the\r\nsame time when it seemed to protect, sought to extend itself together\r\nwith Prussia at their expense, and demanded portions of the Palatinate\r\nand of Hesse. In place of demanding from them the sacrifices which they\r\nfeared, the minister of William I. offered to defend them against the\r\n\"hereditary enemy.\" There was no hesitation: the States of the South\r\nsurrendered, and Prussia concluded with them (from the 17th to the 23d\r\nAugust) _secret_ treaties of offensive and defensive alliance. The\r\ncontracting parties guaranteed reciprocally the integrity of their\r\nrespective territories, and the States of the South engaged to place, in\r\ncase of war, all their military forces at the disposal of the King of\r\nPrussia. The \"matter of business,\" on which M. Rouher had counted, was\r\nhenceforward out of the market; the line of the Main found itself free\r\nbefore it had been traced on the official map of Europe, and from the\r\nmonth of August, 1866, M. de Bismarck could count on the armed\r\ncooperation of all Germany.[98]\r\n\r\nThe military conventions with the States of the South were kept\r\nrigorously secret for a long time, and it was not till the spring of the\r\nfollowing year that M. de Bismarck found it convenient to give them a\r\ncrafty publicity in reply to the speech of the minister of state on the\r\n_three fragments_. Up to that time M. Benedetti had been ignorant of\r\nthem, like other mortals, but he had shown himself more clear-sighted as\r\nregards another very grave event, contemporary with these conventions\r\nconcluded with the South, and he recognized from the beginning the\r\nominous bearing of the mission of General Manteuffel to St. Petersburg\r\nin the month of August, 1866. It must not be forgotten that at the\r\nbottom of the \"new policy\" which during this month they were flattering\r\nthemselves with having inaugurated at the Tuileries by a cordial\r\nunderstanding with the court of Berlin, a Russian problem was agitating.\r\nWould the monarchy of Brandenburg, \"rendered sufficiently independent\r\nand sufficiently compact to loosen itself from its traditions, free\r\nhenceforward from all solidarity,\" decide to break its secular and\r\nhitherto unrelaxed ties with the empire of the czars? That was the true\r\nand vital question of the future. \"Prussia must have an alliance with a\r\ngreat Power,\" the minister of William I. did not cease to reiterate at\r\nthis epoch; but, as Austria was destroyed, and England had long since\r\ncondemned itself to widowhood, only France and Russia remained, between\r\nwhom the lucky conqueror of Sadowa had then the position of the Don Juan\r\nof Mozart, between Dona Anna and Dona Elvira. Surprised in the darkness,\r\nimposed upon in a moment of deplorable misunderstanding, the proud and\r\npassionate Dona Anna occasionally cast glances of defiance and\r\n_venganza_, oftener, alas! looks still ardent from the last embrace, and\r\nbetraying the secret flame, which even said very plainly, that she\r\nwould go still farther, provided there was reparation, provided that a\r\nmarriage followed, if it was only a clandestine marriage. Russia was\r\nDona Elvira, the former, the _legitimate_ ally a little vexed at recent\r\nneglect, even very gravely injured in family interests, but always\r\nloving, always fascinated, and only waiting for a kind word to forget\r\nall and to throw herself into the arms of the fickle one. We only speak\r\nbriefly of Zerline, of Italy, a cunning and lively soubrette, intruding\r\nherself everywhere, in love, she also, the poor little thing, with the\r\nirresistible seducer, and often treated very cavalierly, happy,\r\nnevertheless, to be pinched privately, and to say that she also was\r\n\"protected by a great lord.\"\r\n\r\nSuch being the situation in this decisive month, the ambassador of\r\nFrance to the court of Berlin experienced a violent shock in learning\r\none day of the sudden departure for St. Petersburg of General\r\nManteuffel, the general-diplomat, more diplomat than general, the\r\nconfidant, _par excellence_, of King William, and always the man for\r\nprivate missions. \"I have asked M. de Bismarck,\" M. Benedetti hastened\r\nto write to Paris, \"what I should think of this mission, confided to a\r\ngeneral commanding troops in the campaign. After having pretended that\r\nhe thought he had informed me of it, M. de Bismarck assured me that he\r\nhad told M. de Goltz, in order that he might instruct you.\" Strictly\r\nspeaking, one finds it natural that the king wished to plead before his\r\nimperial nephew the extenuating circumstances of a painful situation,\r\nwhich forced him to take the goods and the crowns of several very near\r\nrelations of the House of Romanoff; but the French ambassador was above\r\nall struck by the circumstance that the journey of M. de Manteuffel had\r\nbeen decided the day after he had delivered his project of the treaty.\r\n\"I asked the president of the council,\" he continues in the same\r\ndispatch, \"if this general officer had been informed of our overture; he\r\nanswered that he had had no occasion to make him a party to it, but that\r\nhe could not guarantee to me that the king had not told him the\r\nsubstance. I should add, as I have told you by telegraph, that I gave a\r\ncopy of our project to M. de Bismarck on Sunday morning, and that\r\nGeneral Manteuffel, who had scarcely removed his head-quarters to\r\nFrankfort, was called to Berlin in the following night.\" Towards the end\r\nof the month of August, when M. de Bismarck for the first time showed\r\nhis hesitation in signing the secret act concerning Belgium, M.\r\nBenedetti wrote, in a letter to M. Rouher, concerning the mission that\r\nM. de Manteuffel continued to fill at St. Petersburg. \"They have\r\nelsewhere obtained assurances which dispense with our aid,\" said he; \"if\r\nthey decline our alliance, it is because they are already provided, or\r\non the eve of being.\"[99]\r\n\r\nGeneral Manteuffel remained several weeks at St. Petersburg; he stayed\r\nthere long enough to dissipate a certain sadness caused by the recent\r\nmisfortunes of the Houses of Hanover, Cassel, Nassau, etc., all allied\r\nby blood to the imperial family of Russia, also long enough to\r\ncommunicate such projects and show autographs by which they had\r\ntreacherously endeavored to turn the Hohenzollern from his loyal,\r\nunalterable affection for his relative of the North. Thanks to all these\r\nproceedings, and all these attentions, the good harmony between the two\r\ncourts became greater than ever; they easily explained the past, and\r\narranged for the future, and the ambassador of France at the court of\r\nBerlin was not deceived in designating, from this moment, the \"bear,\"\r\nwhose skin the general-diplomat had gone to sell on the banks of the\r\nNeva. To speak in the words of the Marquis La Marmora, it was a bear of\r\nthe Balkans, which had not been well for a long time, and which the\r\nEmperor Nicholas had declared _sick_ twenty years before. One will see\r\nin the sequel that Alexander Mikhailovitch did not the less miss the\r\ndeer at the general hunt in 1870, that he scarcely succeeded in getting\r\nfor himself a handful of hair well fitted to adorn his helmet; that\r\ntakes nothing from the merit of the perspicacity which the unfortunate\r\nnegotiator of the _secret_ act concerning Belgium had given proof of on\r\nthis occasion. M. Benedetti early foresaw the desolating truth, which,\r\nfor M. Thiers, was not visible until very late, at the bottom of this\r\n_Russian box_ which M. de Bismarck allowed him one evening, at\r\nVersailles, to rummage with a liberality which was certainly not free\r\nfrom malice.\r\n\r\nIn endeavoring, after the great disaster of the campaign of Bohemia, to\r\nobtain from Prussia compensations first on the Rhine, then on the Meuse,\r\nthe Emperor Napoleon III., in those months of July and August, 1866, had\r\nonly facilitated for M. de Bismarck the two great political\r\ncombinations which were since, in 1870, of such prodigious use: the\r\narmed cooperation of the Southern States, and the moral aid of Russia in\r\ncase of a war with France. The chief fault, however, of the Napoleonic\r\npolicy the day after Sadowa, was to have so well served Prussia in its\r\ndesire to escape from all control on the part of Europe, and to have\r\ngiven its sanction from the very first to such an immense derangement of\r\nthe equilibrium of the world, without the cause being brought before the\r\nareopagus of nations. This forgetfulness of the duties towards the great\r\nChristian family of states was only too quickly and too cruelly avenged,\r\nalas! and Prince Gortchakof, in 1870, only followed a recent and\r\nlamentable example in allowing France and Germany to decide their\r\nquarrel in the lists, in hindering all common action of the Powers, all\r\nEuropean concert. \"I see no Europe!\" cried M. de Beust, in 1870, in a\r\ncelebrated dispatch, and no one thought of disputing this dolorous\r\naffirmation. A few only observed with sadness that the eclipse had\r\nalready lasted several years, that it dated from the preliminaries of\r\nNikolsburg and from the treaty of Prague.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[76] This detail, as well as those which follow, are taken from the\r\nnarration made by M. Thiers himself, some days later, to the diocese of\r\nOrleans, and gathered together by M. A. Boucher in his interesting\r\n_Story of the Invasion_ (Orleans, 1871), pp. 318-325.\r\n\r\n[77] \"He (M. de Bismarck) only goes out accompanied, and agents of\r\nFrench police will come as far as the frontier to follow him during the\r\nwhole journey,\" announced M. de Barral from Berlin, the 1st June, 1866,\r\nthree days after the assault by Blind. M. Jules Favre (_History of the\r\nGovernment of the National Defense_, vol. i. p. 163-164) speaks of the\r\nuneasiness manifested by the minister of William I. at the interview at\r\nthe castle of _Haute-Maison_, at Montry: \"We are very badly off here;\r\nyour _Franc-tireurs_ can take aim at me through the windows.\" One can\r\nalso recall the language of the German chancellor in the Prussian\r\nchambers concerning the assault by Kulmann.\r\n\r\n[78] According to the analysis of Lord Lyons, to whom M. de Chaudordy\r\ncommunicated this telegram.--Dispatch of Lord Lyons, of the 6th October,\r\n1870. It is curious to compare with this singular telegram of M. Thiers\r\nthe opinion expressed by Prince Gortchakof before the English\r\nambassador, \"that the conditions indicated in the circular of M. de\r\nBismarck of the 16th September could only be modified by military\r\nevents, and that nothing authorized such a conjecture.\"--Dispatch of Sir\r\nA. Buchanan of the 17th October. Now the conditions indicated in the\r\nPrussian circular of the 16th September were already _Alsace and Metz_.\r\n\r\n[79] Confidential note of M. Magne for the emperor.--_Papers and\r\nCorrespondence of the Imperial Family_, vol. i. p. 240.\r\n\r\n[80] The letter addressed to the minister of France at the Hague and\r\nplaced under the eyes of the emperor, was re-found at the Tuileries\r\nafter the 4th September.--_Papers and Correspondence of the Imperial\r\nFamily_, vol. i. p. 14.\r\n\r\n[81] This, however, was only a short desire on the part of Prince\r\nGortchakof, a design without consequence, and of which we find the only\r\nauthentic trace in an obscure phrase of a dispatch of the French\r\nambassador at Berlin. Vide Benedetti, _My Mission in Prussia_, p. 226.\r\n\r\n[82] Dispatch in cipher intercepted by the Austrians and published in\r\nconnection with the war of 1866 by the Austrian staff.\r\n\r\n[83] _Papers and Correspondence of the Imperial Family_, vol. ii. pp.\r\n225, 228. The editors pretend that this letter was addressed to M. de\r\nMoustier, which is entirely erroneous, M. de Moustier being then at\r\nConstantinople. We are inclined to believe that the receiver was M.\r\nConti, who had accompanied the emperor to Vichy. It will be remembered\r\nthat Napoleon III., very unwell and suffering during this whole epoch,\r\nhad gone the 27th July to Vichy, where M. Drouyn de Lhuys went to see\r\nhim for a short time; the chief of the state could not, however, prolong\r\nhis sojourn in the watering-place, and returned to Paris on the 8th\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n[84] \"For some time it has been too often said that France _is not\r\nready_.\"--Confidential note of M. Magne of the 20th July (_Papers and\r\nCorrespondence of the Imperial Family_, vol. i. p. 241). M. de Goltz had\r\nearly discovered this secret, and had not ceased to recommend to M. de\r\nBismarck a firm attitude as regarded France.\r\n\r\n[85] _My Mission in Prussia_, pp. 171-172. M. Drouyn de Lhuys, who had\r\nalready obtained from Austria the cession, in any case, of Venetia,\r\ninsisted at this moment more strongly than ever that they should also\r\ntake pledges in advance from Prussia, \"the most formidable, the most\r\nactive of the parties.\" M. Benedetti did not cease to oppose such a\r\nproceeding, fearing that Prussia would renounce in this case all idea of\r\nwar against Austria, and this dispatch of the 8th July was in reality\r\nonly a new plea in favor of the _laisser-aller_ without conditions which\r\nshould be granted to M. de Bismarck.\r\n\r\n[86] Benedetti, _My Mission in Prussia_, pp. 177 and 178. _Moniteur\r\nprussien_ (_Reichsanzeiger_) of the 21st October, 1871.\r\n\r\n[87] _My Mission in Prussia_, p. 181. This assertion of M. Benedetti is\r\nfully confirmed by the note found among the papers of the Tuileries, of\r\nwhich we will speak farther on.\r\n\r\n[88] \"Prussia will disregard what justice and foresight demand, and will\r\ngive us at the same time the measure of its ingratitude, if it refuses\r\nus the guarantees which the extension of its frontiers obliges us to\r\nclaim.\"--Dispatch of M. Benedetti, the 5th August, 1866, found at the\r\ncastle of Cercay among the papers of M. Rouher, and published in the\r\n_Moniteur prussien_ of the 21st October, 1871. Towards the same epoch,\r\nthey spoke also of the ingratitude of Italy. \"The unjustifiable\r\ningratitude of Italy irritates the calmest minds,\" wrote M. Magne in his\r\nconfidential note by order of the emperor, dated the 20th July. The\r\ncabinet of Florence in truth created in France at this moment unheard of\r\nembarrassments by susceptibilities and demands which, to say the least,\r\nwere very ill-timed. After having been beaten on land and sea, at\r\nCustozza and at Lissa, and having received as a recompense the\r\nmagnificent gift of Venetia, the Italians made pretensions to Tyrol!\r\nThere was even an instant when the emperor thought \"of renouncing the\r\nfatal gift made him, and of declaring, by an official act, that he gave\r\nback to Austria its parole.\" See the curious note of M. Rouher written\r\nby order of the emperor, _Papers and Correspondence of the Imperial\r\nFamily_, vol. ii. pp. 229 and 23.\r\n\r\n[89] La Marmora, _Un po piu di luce_, p. 117. Report of General Govone,\r\n3d June, 1866. _Ibid._ p. 275.\r\n\r\n[90] \"All the efforts which he (M. de Bismarck) has without cessation\r\nmade to bring about an agreement with us prove sufficiently that, in his\r\nopinion, it was essential to indemnify France.\"--_My Mission in\r\nPrussia_, p. 192. Thus thought the ex-ambassador of France, even in\r\n1871!\r\n\r\n[91] _Papers and Correspondence of the Imperial Family_, vol. i. pp. 16,\r\n17. The editors thought that they recognized in this note the\r\nhandwriting of M. Conti, chief of the emperor's cabinet.\r\n\r\n[92] \"On my departure from Paris, towards the middle of August,\" says M.\r\nBenedetti, in his book, _My Mission in Prussia_, p. 194, \"M. Drouyn de\r\nLhuys had offered his resignation, and I supposed that his successor\r\nwould be M. Moustier, who was then ambassador at Constantinople. At this\r\nmoment there was no minister of foreign affairs. In this state of\r\nthings, I thought it _proper_ to address to the minister of state, M.\r\nRouher, the letter in which I announced my interview with M. de\r\nBismarck, and which accompanied the plan of treaty relative to Belgium.\"\r\nM. Drouyn de Lhuys had not tendered his resignation towards the middle\r\nof August; right or wrong, he believed at this epoch that he was \"doing\r\nan act of honesty and disinterestedness in remaining,\" and his portfolio\r\nwas not taken from him till 1st September, 1866. Up to that date M.\r\nDrouyn de Lhuys had not ceased to direct the department; the ambassador\r\nhimself quotes in his book several dispatches exchanged with him, on\r\ngrave questions, dated 21st and 25th August (pp. 204, 223), and M.\r\nBenedetti has singular ideas on the hierarchical duties, believing that\r\nit is _proper_ for an agent to evade the control of his immediate chief\r\nin view of his near retirement. The conclusion of the passage quoted in\r\nthe book of M. Benedetti is not less curious: \"M. Rouher,\" says he, \"has\r\nnot laid before the ministry, having never taken the direction of it,\r\nthe correspondence which I, during several days, exchanged with him. If\r\nI gave it here, I should not know how to refer the reader, that he might\r\nverify the text of it, to the depot of the archives, as I am authorized\r\nto do with all the documents which I put before his eyes.\" What of that?\r\nOnce decided to make revelations, M. Benedetti could have well produced\r\nthis correspondence with M. Rouher on such a disputed subject, while\r\nconscientiously warning the reader that he could not find the originals\r\nat the depot of the archives. (It is known that the originals were\r\nseized by the Prussians, with a great number of other important\r\ndocuments, in the castle of M. Rouher, at Cercay.) While throwing \"a\r\nlittle more light\" on all the unnatural obscurities, let us also observe\r\nthat it is wrongfully, but with a design easy to divine, that the\r\ncelebrated circular of M. de Bismarck, of the 29th July, 1870 (at the\r\nbeginning of the war), had assigned to this plan of the secret treaty\r\nconcerning Belgium a much later date, the year 1867, the epoch after the\r\narrangement of the affair of Luxemburg. This allegation does not\r\nwithstand a first examination and a simple comparison of the parts\r\ndelivered to the public. The shadowy negotiation on the subject of\r\nBelgium was held in the second half of the month of August, 1866, as M.\r\nBenedetti says.\r\n\r\n[93] The _Moniteur prussien_ of the 21st October, 1871, gives (from the\r\ndocuments seized at Cercay) extracts from the instructions sent from\r\nParis the 16th August to M. Benedetti concerning the secret treaty. A\r\npassage from these instructions contains \"the designation of the persons\r\nto whom this negotiation was to be confined.\"\r\n\r\n[94] Quoted from the circular of M. de La Valette of the 16th September,\r\n1862.\r\n\r\n[95] These details, as well as those which follow, are taken from the\r\npapers seized at Cercay and published in the _Moniteur prussien_ of the\r\n21st October, 1871.\r\n\r\n[96] The two plans of the treaties have since been published by the\r\nPrussian journals of the 29th July and 8th August, 1870. The Prussian\r\ngovernment is now in possession of two French autographs of the plan\r\nconcerning Belgium; the one which M. Benedetti left with M. de Bismarck\r\nin the month of August, 1866, the other likewise from the hand of M.\r\nBenedetti, with marginal notes by Napoleon III. and M. Rouher; this\r\nlatter document was seized at Cercay. For the description and other\r\ndetails, see the _Moniteur prussien_ of the 21st October, 1871, and the\r\narticle from the _North German Gazette_ on the subject of the affair La\r\nMarmora.\r\n\r\n[97] Private letter from M. Benedetti to the Duke of Gramont, dated 22d\r\nAugust, 1866. _My Mission in Prussia_, p. 192.\r\n\r\n[98] Albert Sorel, _Diplomatic History of the Franco-German War_, vol.\r\ni. pp. 29, 30.\r\n\r\n[99] Papers seized at Cercay, _Moniteur prussien_ of the 21st October,\r\n1871.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nORIENT AND OCCIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\"They have provided themselves elsewhere,\" the French ambassador at the\r\ncourt of William I. sadly wrote, in the last days of the month of\r\nAugust, 1866, on seeing Prussia so brusquely break off the _dilatory\r\nnegotiations_ concerning Belgium; and it is just to add that he has\r\nnever since ceased to clearly appreciate the situation, and to keep his\r\ncountry constantly on its guard as regards the confidential harmony and\r\nabsolute agreement between the two courts of Berlin and St. Petersburg\r\nafter the mission of General Manteuffel. If he nevertheless endeavored\r\nfor some time to obtain a compensation for his country,--a very modest\r\none, it is true, and consonant with the new fortune of France,--if,\r\nduring the first months of the year 1867, he particularly flattered\r\nhimself with obtaining from the kindness of M. de Bismarck the\r\npermission to buy Luxemburg from the King of Holland, if he even once\r\nwent so far, during a hasty journey to Paris, as to affirm, in a\r\nconfidential conversation, that he already had the fortress of Alzette\r\n\"in his pocket,\" it was not that he thought it possible to return to the\r\nbeautiful dream of the head-quarters of Bruenn, and to effect that\r\n\"necessary and fruitful alliance with Prussia\" with which at a certain\r\nmoment some sanguine minds on the banks of the Seine had been deluded.\r\nHe was only persuaded that the conqueror of Sadowa would not envy France\r\nthis paltry atonement of Luxemburg, that he would even find it worth\r\nwhile to \"indemnify\" the Emperor Napoleon III. so cheaply, so that, in\r\nthe words of the poet, \"the lion would only gape before such a little\r\nmorsel.\" The lion roared, however, shook his mane with fury, and\r\nsignified harshly that it had done forever with any _politique de\r\npour-boire_. But even this only confirmed M. Benedetti in the opinion\r\nthat they had provided themselves elsewhere, and that henceforward they\r\nwere on the verge of great trouble. He thought rightly that M. de\r\nBismarck must be very sure of the support, in any case, of his former\r\ncolleague of Frankfort, to refuse to France even this moderate prize\r\n(_aubaine_), and to give it on this occasion \"the measure of its\r\ningratitude.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time with the affair of Luxemburg, the events in Crete\r\nshowed in their turn to the cabinets of Vienna and the Tuileries how far\r\nPrince Gortchakof was already pledged to M. de Bismarck, and how\r\nresolved to sacrifice to his friendship with Prussia the most brilliant\r\nprospects. Whoever reads attentively the curious exchange of notes which\r\nthe troubles of Crete had caused, will see that, during the entire epoch\r\nfrom the month of November, 1866, to the month of March, 1867, the two\r\ngovernments of Austria and France had sought to sound the designs of the\r\ncourt of St. Petersburg, and to make very significant advances to it.\r\nThe insurrection of the Candiots, one will remember, in the autumn of\r\n1866, surprised and moved Europe, scarcely recovered from the violent\r\nshock of Sadowa. Immoderately exaggerated by the journalists, who were\r\nmore or less interested, after having excited lively sympathy in Russia,\r\nthe insurrection ended by seriously occupying the attention of the\r\nchancellors, and seemed for a moment destined to bring before the\r\ncabinets the whole question of the Orient in its appalling _ensemble_.\r\nCertain cabinets did not even seem greatly dismayed at the contingency:\r\ninstead of conforming with the constant traditions of diplomacy in the\r\nOttoman affairs, instead of quelling the disturbance and lessening as\r\nmuch as possible its proportions and bearings, M. de Moustier thought\r\nthat he ought \"to find means to pacify the Orient,\" and busied himself\r\n\"in convoking a sort of _consultation of doctors_ to learn the opinion\r\nof each one concerning the remedy to be applied to the evil.\"[100] Still\r\nmore astonishing was the language used by the government of Vienna, by\r\nthe Power which up to that time and always had contented itself with\r\nsustaining Turkey _per fas et nefas_, without demanding anything from\r\nit, no more for the immediate subjects of the sultan than for the\r\ntributary provinces. Resolutely breaking with these habits of the past,\r\nM. de Beust, who had at this time just undertaken the direction of\r\naffairs in Austria, wrote on the 10th November, 1866, to his ambassador\r\nat Paris that, while desiring to preserve the throne of the sultan,\r\n\"Austria could not refuse its sympathies and its support in a certain\r\ndegree to the Christian peoples of Turkey who have at times just\r\ndemands to make, and who are connected with some of the peoples of the\r\nAustrian empire by close ties of blood and religion.\" Questioned some\r\ndays later (28th November) by the envoy of Russia at the court of\r\nVienna, the Austrian minister did not hesitate to reply that he was\r\ndisposed to favor amongst the Christians of the Orient \"the development\r\nof their autonomy and the establishment of a limited self-government by\r\na bond of vassalage.\" Lastly, in a remarkable dispatch addressed to\r\nPrince Metternich and dated the 1st January, 1867, M. de Beust proposed\r\n\"a revision of the treaty of Paris of the 30th March, 1856, and\r\nsubsequent acts,\" announcing in advance his desire to make over, in the\r\narrangement to intervene, the greater part to Russia. He had no trouble\r\nin showing that \"the remedies through which they had sought, in the\r\ncourse of the last few years, to maintain the _statu quo_ in the Orient,\r\nhad shown themselves insufficient to subdue the difficulties which grew\r\nwith each day.\" \"The physiognomy of the Orient taken as a whole,\"\r\ncontinued the dispatch, \"shows itself to-day under an essentially\r\ndifferent aspect from that which it had in 1856, and the stipulations of\r\nthat epoch, exceeded as they are on more than one important point by\r\nafter events, no longer answer to the necessities of the actual\r\nsituation.\" In a word, M. de Beust looked to nothing less than to a\r\njoint intervention of the European Powers in the affairs of Turkey,\r\nwithout concealing that in such a situation, \"there would be an\r\nopportunity to take into consideration, in a fitting degree, the natural\r\n_role_ which the commonalty of religious institutions would secure for\r\nRussia in the Orient,\" and clearly showing the necessity of relieving\r\nthe empire of the czars of the onerous conditions which were imposed\r\nupon it in the Black Sea, \"in order to secure for himself by a\r\nconciliating attitude the sincere cooperation of this Power in the\r\nquestions of the Levant.\"\r\n\r\nIt was truly a bold plan; it did not even fail to violently shock the\r\nFrench feelings. Was it not in truth to erase with a single stroke a\r\npast of ten years, to lose all the fruit of the Crimean war? They had\r\nsome repugnance in avowing to themselves that the treaty of 1856 had not\r\nexisted for a long time, alas! since the day when the French government\r\nhad broken by its gratuitous kindness towards Russia this cluster of the\r\nthree great Occidental Powers which alone could assure its efficacious\r\nexecution. Since then the act had gradually become void, had been\r\nviolated in the majority of the stipulations; and the conference of\r\nParis, charged nominally with watching over the observance of the\r\ntreaty, was always restricted, as the Austrian dispatch observed, \"in\r\ngiving its sanction to facts accomplished outside of its sphere of\r\naction, and which were not in harmony with the agreements placed under\r\nits protection.\" However, on the day after Sadowa, Prince Gortchakof did\r\nnot fail to seize the first opportunity to begin to prepare the epitaph\r\nof the treaty of Paris. \"Our august master,\" said the Russian chancellor\r\nin a document dated the 20th August, 1866, and marked by fine\r\nirony,--\"our august master does not intend to insist on the general\r\nengagements of the treaties _which have no value except by reason of\r\nthe accord existing between the great Powers in order to make them\r\nrespected_, and which to-day have received, by _the want of this joint\r\nwill_, too frequent and too severe blows not to be rendered _invalid_.\"\r\nIt was exactly this _collective will_ which M. de Beust expected to\r\nrevive and strengthen in projecting the revision of the act of 1856.\r\nAccording to his opinion, the treaty of Paris had not attained its\r\npurpose, which was to insure the entireness and the vitality of the\r\nOttoman empire. On one side the Occidental Powers have imposed on Russia\r\non the banks of the Euxine a restriction of its rights of sovereignty\r\nwhich a great empire could not definitely accept, and from which sooner\r\nor later it would seek to free itself. On the other side, and as regards\r\nthe Christian population of the Levant, they contented themselves with\r\npromulgating a firman promising reforms, and leaving Turkey to itself,\r\ninstead of reserving for Europe the right to watch over the Ottoman\r\ngovernment with a gentle but continued vigilance, so that it should\r\nfulfill its duties toward the rajahs, and by a wise and honest\r\nadministration become independent and strong. The treaty of Paris had\r\nonly, thought the Austrian minister, given to Russia what the Crimean\r\nwar ought to have refused it above all,--the monopoly of influence over\r\nthe rajahs; this monopoly it continued to exercise as in the past, in a\r\nhidden manner, it is true, but so much the more dangerously as it\r\nrecognized no competition. M. de Beust wished to reestablish the\r\ncompetition, or rather he wished to establish a general agreement \"to\r\nmake the Christian populations of the sultan _the debtors of all\r\nEurope_, in giving them, by the care of all the guaranteeing courts,\r\nautonomous institutions according to the diversity of religions and\r\nraces,\"[101] and he hesitated the less to make to this vast conception\r\nthe sacrifice of the article of the treaty of Paris touching the\r\nneutralization of the Black Sea which Austria had combated from the\r\nbeginning, and to which it had only given its adherence at the last\r\nmoment to humor the Occidental Powers and put an end to the Crimean war,\r\nthe events of which had since demonstrated its complete inefficacy. It\r\nwas under the influence of the disaster of Sinopa that France and\r\nEngland had hoped to restrain the naval forces of the czar in the\r\nEuxine. They had thus thought to shelter Constantinople from a blow from\r\nthe Russian hand; but on this point, as on so many others, the\r\nphysiognomy of the Orient had essentially changed. Russia no longer\r\nmeditated a _coup de main_: it advanced more slowly, but much more\r\nsurely, towards its goal. The pacification of the Caucasus[102] the\r\nirremediable weakness of the Porte and the daily increasing discontent\r\nof the rajahs, as impatient of the Turkish yoke as they were devoted to\r\ntheir sole protector, the czar, were worth to it all the vessels of the\r\nBlack Sea. \"However, have they really freed Constantinople from all\r\ndanger on that side?\" asked the Austrian minister. \"Supposing that\r\nRussia decides to construct vessels in the Sea of Asoph, will war be\r\ndeclared to hinder it?\" And the cabinet of Vienna concluded by these\r\ncharacteristic words: \"The question of _amour-propre_ should not be\r\ndecisive in view of the immense interests which are at stake to-day.\" In\r\nfact, they could not insist too much on this truth: the clause on the\r\nsubject of the Euxine had been for a long time only a \"question of\r\n_amour-propre_\" between the Occidental Powers and Russia; nor could one\r\ndeny that M. de Beust saw far and justly in his dispatch of the 1st\r\nJanuary, 1867. On the day after Sadowa, he sought to reconstitute\r\nEurope, to regain it, if we are allowed to express ourselves thus, and\r\nhe knew how to fix the price of it.\r\n\r\nIn a different direction, France exerted itself on its part to accede to\r\nthe views of the cabinet of St. Petersburg in concentrating its efforts\r\nprincipally on the question of the hour, on this Candian insurrection,\r\nof which public opinion in Russia had so ardently espoused the cause. M.\r\nde Moustier proposed to Prince Gortchakof \"an understanding on the\r\neventualities which might arise in the Orient,\" and, after having\r\nalready spoken of a \"consultation of doctors,\" in a dispatch addressed\r\nto the ambassador of France at Constantinople (7th December, 1866) he\r\neven pronounced the words \"heroic remedies.\" By this always medical\r\neuphemism, one understood, at Paris, the annexation of the isle of Crete\r\nto Greece, \"the only possible issue,\" Prince Gortchakof had affirmed,\r\nthe 16th November, 1866, \"if the Powers will leave expedients and\r\npalliatives, which up to the present time have only increased for the\r\nfuture the present difficulties.\" The marriage of the young King of the\r\nGreeks, George I., with the Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna, was then\r\na decided matter, and at the Tuileries one demanded nothing better than\r\nto make the isle of Crete the \"dowry\" of the Russian princess. In fact\r\nthey would not have felt any inconvenience, it seems, in increasing this\r\ndowry with Epirus and Thessaly: that was going very far, much farther\r\neven than could be desired by Russia, which had no interest in \"allowing\r\nsuch an extension of Greece that it might become a powerful state.\"[103]\r\nIt was the reconciliation between France and Russia that gave birth to\r\nthe plan of a common proceeding to demand of the Turkish government the\r\nrealization of the internal reforms, and the cession of Crete, disguised\r\nunder the proposition of a plebiscite, a proceeding which was\r\neffectively realized in the month of March, 1867, and to which Austria,\r\nPrussia, and Italy rallied. Without doubt there was still a great deal\r\nof vagueness, and above all of desultoriness in the situation which\r\nbegan to take a form at this moment, and it was to be regretted that\r\nFrance and Austria had not previously agreed to be of one mind on the\r\nnature of the offers which they intended to make to Russia; but the\r\noffers were very real and very great, we cannot deny that; and it only\r\ndepended on the successor of Count Nesselrode to arrange, to adjust, and\r\nto turn them to the profit and the glory of his august master. England\r\ncould not oppose serious obstacles to the joint will of France, Russia,\r\nand Austria, in the affairs of the Levant; it was already resigned, and\r\ncertainly the fruit which Prince Gortchakof saw ripening in the spring\r\nof 1867, although not having all the attraction of forbidden fruit, was\r\nnevertheless good and savory, very different from that which, four years\r\nlater, he was to pick up in the ashes of Sedan.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the governments of France and Austria did not mean to\r\nmake a gratuitous gift; it was understood that, in exchange for these\r\nvery large concessions in the Orient, they should obtain the support of\r\nthe cabinet of St. Petersburg in the menacing complications of the\r\nOccident, and many circumstances seemed to plead in favor of such a\r\ncombination. After all, and exclusive of the vengeance taken on \"the\r\nungrateful\" empire of the Hapsburg, Russia could not greatly rejoice at\r\nthe work of M. de Bismarck. Without mentioning several relations of the\r\nimperial family whom the Hohenzollern dethroned and despoiled with\r\nfirmness tempered with a few tears, there was in general in the\r\nproceedings and principles inaugurated on the Elbe and the Main a strong\r\nrevolutionary taint which could hardly please a court which did not\r\ncease to protect the shadow of Nicholas. The gravest, however, was that\r\nthe victory of Sadowa had just brusquely disturbed and even threatened\r\nto ruin entirely the secular system of the Russian policy in regard to\r\nthe affairs of Germany.\r\n\r\nIn fact, since Peter the Great, especially since Catherine II., Russia\r\nhad always labored to obtain a preponderant influence among the\r\ndifferent German courts: its czars have more than once acted with a high\r\nhand and used high words in the Teutonic troubles. \"The Romanof enjoys\r\nwith us a birthright acknowledged by his brothers, our sovereigns of the\r\n_Bund_,\" a celebrated publicist of the other side of the Rhine exclaimed\r\nwith bitterness one day, and the attitude of the secondary States during\r\nthe Crimean war truly did not weaken the justice of this expression. But\r\nit was this work of several reigns, and of a thought hitherto immutable,\r\nthat Russia saw placed in question by the foreseen results of the\r\ncampaign of Bohemia. The North of Germany was already escaping its\r\ninfluence, and the \"_naif_\" ones alone could deceive themselves on the\r\nfortune reserved for the South in a very near future. \"From the month of\r\nSeptember, 1866, the cabinet of Berlin had, in a circular which was\r\ndesignedly made public, claimed for the confederation of the North and\r\nthe States of the South alone, to the exclusion of all the other Powers,\r\nwithout excepting Austria, the right to bind their relations as closely\r\nas they wished, thus giving to Article IV. of the treaty of Prague, an\r\ninterpretation of which it did not admit. In the speeches which he had\r\ndelivered at the opening of the Prussian chambers and of the Northern\r\nparliament, the king himself, while addressing them _to Germany, to the\r\nbrotherly peoples, to the country which the Alps and the Baltic bound_,\r\nhad given utterance to allusions which made, according to the expression\r\nof the official journals, the hearts of all patriots tremble.\"[104] On\r\nhis part, M. de Bismarck had cried out in the midst of the same\r\nparliament, using these gambling terms which are so common in his\r\nlanguage and so characteristic of his temperament: \"Our stake has become\r\ngreater in consequence of our victories; we have now more to lose, but\r\nthe game is still far from being completely won!\" By means of a combined\r\nand resolute action of Europe; the absorption of all Germany by Prussia\r\nwas only a question of time and of management; Russia, even less than\r\nFrance, would find its reward in it. France only saw uniting in a more\r\ncompact and menacing body a confederation of kingdoms and principalities\r\nwhich already before had been either hostile, or at least opposed to it.\r\nRussia, on the contrary, lost an entire league of states, whose fidelity\r\nand devotion had never wavered, who formed for it a sort of continuous\r\n_enceinte_ on the side of an occasionally unsympathetic Occident; in\r\ntheir place was to arise a formidable Power, restless and invading from\r\nthe very start, called sooner or later by the necessity of history, by\r\nthe fatality of race, to represent and to oppose the Germanic to the\r\nSclavic idea. At every other epoch of the empire of the czars, in the\r\ngood old time of Count Nesselrode, for instance,--when, in place of a\r\npolicy of spite and propaganda on the banks of the Neva, they maintained\r\na policy of conservation and equilibrium,--the conduct of a Russian\r\nchancellor in such an occurrence would not have been doubtful: a\r\ncoalition of Russia, of France, and of Austria would have been formed on\r\nthe day after Sadowa for the safety of Europe, and it is not saying too\r\nmuch to affirm that, in the spring of the year 1867, Alexander\r\nMikhailovitch held in his hands the destinies of the world.\r\n\r\nThus compelled to make his choice, Prince Gortchakof was unwilling to\r\ndecline the French and Austrian advances in the question of the Orient;\r\non the contrary, he hastened to echo them loudly, and sometimes even\r\nrose on this occasion to a lyricism not often heard in the chancellors'\r\noffices. He was charmed with the new minister of Austria, and filled all\r\nthe country with a rather forced enthusiasm. \"M. de Beust,\" he wrote to\r\nhis ambassador in London, \"inaugurates a new era in the policy of\r\nAustria, an era of large and elevated views; he is the first statesman\r\nof this country and of our epoch who courageously endeavors to leave the\r\nground of petty rivalries.\" As regards France, he endeavored especially\r\nto indicate plainly that the initiative came from it, and \"while begging\r\nthe Emperor Napoleon III. to recall the interviews which the Emperor\r\nAlexander had had with him at Stuttgart\" (in 1860), he seemed to wish to\r\nassign to the present conferences an extraordinary character of gravity\r\nand generality. \"His imperial majesty,\" continued the Russian\r\nchancellor, in his dispatch of the 16th November, 1866, to M. de\r\nBudberg, \"has received with satisfaction the overtures which M. le\r\nMarquis de Moustier has made us in view of an understanding between the\r\nFrench cabinet and ours on the eventualities which might arise in the\r\nOrient. The general principles which the French minister of foreign\r\naffairs has propounded, the assurances which he has given us, have in\r\nthe eyes of our august master a very especial value, since they emanate\r\nfrom the direct thought of the Emperor Napoleon, and since it was by the\r\nexpress order of his majesty that M. le Marquis de Moustier has\r\nbroached these questions.\" The animation and spirits of Alexander\r\nMikhailovitch increase daily: he even ended by talking Latin and by\r\nconfounding the poor Turkish envoy with a classical quotation. \"Here,\"\r\nhe wrote in the month of February, 1867, \"is what I have said to\r\nComnenos-Bey: the isle of Crete is lost to you; after six months of such\r\na bitter struggle, reconciliation is no longer possible. Even admitting\r\nthat you succeeded in reestablishing there for some time the authority\r\nof the sultan, it would only be on a heap of ruins and a mountain of\r\ncorpses. Tacitus long ago told us of the danger there is in this reign\r\nof silence which succeeds devastation: _Solitudinem faciunt, pacem\r\nappellant_.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it did not take long to see that while holding out hopes\r\nto France and Austria for the success of their Oriental movement, and\r\neven endeavoring to compromise them in this direction as much as\r\npossible,[105] the Russian chancellor was extremely careful to maintain\r\nhis intimate accord with his former colleague of Frankfort, and not to\r\noppose him in his ideas in the affairs of the Occident. Very ardent for\r\nthe cause of the plebiscite in Crete, he showed on the contrary an\r\nabsolute indifference on the subject of an analogous cause on the Eider,\r\notherwise legitimate, however, guaranteed by solemn treaties,[106] and\r\nwhich interested to such a high degree the noble and unfortunate country\r\nof the future empress. He preserved a not less significant silence as\r\nregarded the publication made in the month of March, 1867, by M. de\r\nBismarck, of the conventions with the Southern States, conventions which\r\nbound to Prussia the military forces of Germany, and abolished, in fact,\r\n\"the international independent situation\" which the preliminaries of\r\nNikolsburg had stipulated for Bavaria and Wuertemberg.[107] Alexander\r\nMikhailovitch held Wuertemberg as cheaply as Denmark, the throne of Queen\r\nOlga, as the cradle of the Princess Dagmar. In the mean time the affair\r\nof Luxemburg arose, and the French government could measure the degree\r\nof benevolence with which it had succeeded in inspiring the cabinet of\r\nSt. Petersburg by its \"heroic remedies\" as regards Turkey. The Russian\r\nchancellor was surely right and very sincere in his desire for peace,\r\nbut he had not for the position of France the regards which England\r\nitself thought just to show it; he seemed, above all, engaged in not\r\ngiving umbrage to his illustrious friend of Berlin. While also\r\nglorifying M. de Beust for his \"courageous endeavor to have done with\r\npetty rivalries,\" the Russian government did not fail to encourage at\r\nthe same time, in the most dangerous and provoking manner, the violent\r\nSclavic opposition in the empire of the Hapsburg by means of that famous\r\n_congress_ of Moscow, of which we shall speak later. Other deceptions\r\nstill, less known to the public, but not less sharp, probably added to\r\nall these disappointments, for Austria as well as France did not delay\r\nin making their retreat from this shifting ground of the Orient and\r\njoining in with England in thenceforward firmly maintaining the rights\r\nof the sultan. The \"consultation of doctors\" had a final end, and the\r\nlegendary _sick man_ was none the worse for it; but all was then decided\r\nfor the terrible eventualities of the future.\r\n\r\n\"There exists an understanding between St. Petersburg and Berlin,\" M.\r\nBenedetti again avowed in the year after (5th January, 1868), while\r\nspeaking of the so often mentioned mission of General Manteuffel as the\r\npoint of departure of this agreement which did not cease to harass him.\r\n\"Was it not, in fact, from this moment,\" he asked, \"that the two courts\r\nindicate more plainly their policy, Russia in the Orient and in the\r\nSclavic Provinces of Austria, Prussia in Germany, without even a cloud\r\narising between them? Firmly united on all questions, they have, each\r\nfor itself, pursued their designs with a confidence which proves that\r\nthey have stipulated mutual guarantees.\" And the ambassador adds that\r\nthis conviction begins to impress itself on many minds, especially on\r\nLord Loftus, his English colleague, for a long time very incredulous on\r\nthis matter. \"His manner of seeing is sensibly modified, and he is not\r\nless persuaded than other members of the diplomatic corps that final\r\narrangements had been made between the two governments of King William\r\nand the Emperor Alexander. I have, for my part, found the permanent\r\ndemonstration of it, if I may so express myself, in the firmly fixed\r\nresolution, which has never changed, of the cabinet of Berlin, to\r\ninaugurate German unity for its own especial benefit, without allowing\r\nitself to be moved for an instant by the possibility of a conflict with\r\nFrance. I have also seen the proof of it in the care with which M. de\r\nBismarck avoids explaining himself on the question of the Orient. When\r\none asks him, he replies that he never reads the correspondence of the\r\nministers of the king at Constantinople; and your excellency will not\r\nhave forgotten with what complaisance he has always lent himself to the\r\nviews of Prince Gortchakof.\" M. Benedetti also notices \"the new impulse\r\ngiven since last summer to the Pan-Sclavic propaganda;\" he shows very\r\nclearly the vast designs and far-reaching hopes of the cabinet of St.\r\nPetersburg, in its connivance with Prussia, and gives a higher and\r\njuster idea in general of the Russian policy at this epoch than certain\r\nill-advised panegyrists of our day, who, to prove that Prince Gortchakof\r\nhas filled his _role_ as completely as possible, and with all desirable\r\nsuccess, can devise nothing better than to lessen and depreciate this\r\npart.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIt is the characteristic of all conventional praise to exaggerate not\r\nonly the tone, but even to deceive itself sometimes in the amount; there\r\nis perfume and ashes in incense, said the ancients, and there is\r\nsomething equivocal also in the usual manner of congratulating the\r\nRussian chancellor on his \"triumph\" in the question of the Euxine. To\r\npretend that Prince Gortchakof did not favor the audacious designs of\r\nPrussia in order to free Russia from its bonds in the Black Sea, that he\r\ndelivered Europe in advance to Prince Bismarck in the sole hope of some\r\nday repudiating to his advantage the act of 1856, is in truth to pay as\r\nlittle honor to his genius as to his patriotism. Certainly the eminent\r\nstatesman whose \"prophetic glance\" the grandchildren of Washington[108]\r\ncelebrated at St. Petersburg in the year of Sadowa, supplicating the\r\neternal God, \"who had made the sun stand still for Joshua,\" also to\r\nsuspend the course of life for Alexander Mikhailovitch, \"so that the\r\neyes of the world might long remain fixed on him,\"[109] the consummate\r\ndiplomat who, in the spring of 1867, slighted the important advances\r\nmade by the cabinets of Vienna and the Tuileries,--certainly this\r\nminister did not fail at this moment to put aside with a disdainful\r\nsmile, the petty hypothesis, that in the approaching and foreseen\r\noverturning of Europe, there would be assigned to Russia as its sole\r\nvictory and conquest, the abolition of any wounding article of a treaty\r\nwhich events had long before rendered \"invalid.\" It was not for such a\r\n\"plate of lentils,\" to use the language of M. de Bismarck, that Prince\r\nGortchakof intended to cede to the Hohenzollern the fixed _birthright_\r\nof the Romanof; he did not think of abandoning the Occident for such a\r\nridiculous price: he looked higher, and expected to have the lion's\r\nshare in the quarry to come. Fortune has deceived his hopes, defeated\r\nhis calculations, and forced him to bend to many unforeseen necessities;\r\nbut, if it is puerile to allow him to have made virtues of all these\r\nvexatious necessities, and to form for him a sort of aureole of\r\nlightnings and thunderbolts of the war of 1870, history, in its\r\nimpartiality, must not the less take into consideration the intentions\r\nof Prince Gortchakof, which were as great as the events themselves, and,\r\nwithout denying his defeat, nevertheless accord him the full benefit _in\r\nmagnis voluisse_.\r\n\r\nThey cherished, in fact, great, gigantic projects on the banks of the\r\nMoscova and the Neva, in all this agitated and feverish epoch which\r\nseparated Sedan from Sadowa; they deluded themselves with enchanting\r\ndreams; they divided the world between Sclavians and Germans, and the\r\n\"national\" minister responded to the ardent wishes of the entire nation\r\nin making the Prussian alliance the pivot of its policy, in seeing in it\r\nthe absolute condition and the sure pledge of a future of glory and\r\nprosperity for Russia. We must look back on the universal mental\r\nagitation in consequence of the equally prodigious and unforeseen\r\nvictory of Prussia in 1866, on the innumerable fantastic plans which\r\nwere then suddenly formed for the reconstruction of empires and races;\r\nit is necessary to recall this endless flight of Minervas all armed,\r\nwhom the blow of the German Vulcan's hammer caused to spring forth from\r\nso many cracked heads who thought themselves Olympian,--the general\r\n_remoulding_ which our poor philosophy of history, at once so cutting\r\nand so malleable, undergoes in the twinkling of an eye,--to appreciate\r\njustly the current of strange and impetuous ideas which then seized the\r\npeople of Peter the Great and of Catherine II. \"An irresistible power\r\nforces the people to reunite in great masses, making the secondary\r\nStates disappear, and this tendency is perhaps inspired by a sort of\r\nprovidential prevision of the destinies of the world.\" This, on the day\r\nafter Sadowa, was the expression of an official document of\r\nincontestable authority, a diplomatic manifest which announced _urbi et\r\norbi_ the profoundest thoughts of the imperial government of\r\nFrance.[110] How can one be astonished, then, that the children of\r\nRourik followed the same reasoning, and asked themselves with candor if\r\nthe battle of Koenigsgraetz did not entirely deliver Central Europe to\r\nthe Hohenzollern and Oriental Europe to the Romanof? After some moments\r\nof hesitation and surprise, Muscovite patriotism resolved therefore, to\r\ntake no umbrage at the ambition of King William I., but it immediately\r\nproclaimed that Russia also had a mission to fulfill, an \"idea\" to\r\nrealize, and that the sun of national unities and grand combinations\r\nshone for all the world.\r\n\r\nThere was in the old capital of the czars a celebrated journal whose\r\npower has since greatly declined, and which, although now an ordinary\r\npaper only, but still important, then exercised a preponderant, tyrannic\r\ninfluence, from the Dwina to the Ural: it was occasionally called, and\r\nwithout malice, \"the first power in the state after the emperor.\" From\r\nthe time of the fatal insurrections of Poland, the \"Gazette of Moscow\"\r\nwas in truth the monitor of the popular passions of Holy Russia, the\r\noffice from whence the word of command for public opinion went forth\r\ninto the vast empire of the North, and it often issued formal\r\ninstructions for the directing ministers at St. Petersburg. Even at this\r\ntime the all-powerful organ of M. Katkof made itself the mouth-piece of\r\nthe nation, and imperiously traced the programme of the policy of the\r\nfuture. Only a short time after the conclusion of the peace of Prague,\r\nthe journal of Moscow laid down \"as an incontestable truth, that the\r\nmarch of events has produced interests which invite the two Powers of\r\nRussia and Prussia to ally themselves still more actively than in the\r\npast;\" it affirmed, moreover, that overtures on this point had been made\r\nby M. de Bismarck, \"overtures the more acceptable as Prussia has no\r\ninterests in the Orient; on this question, the cabinet of Berlin could\r\ntake, in concert with Russia, such an attitude as suited it.\" The theme\r\nwas again taken up and developed under many a form and in many an\r\narticle, until a leader of the 17th February, 1867, impressed on it the\r\ngreat consecration of a speculative and humanitarian principle.\r\n\r\n\"The new era is at last sketched,\" one reads there, \"and for us Russians\r\nit has a peculiar bearing. This era is truly ours; it calls to life a\r\nnew world kept until now in the shadow and expectation of its destinies,\r\nthe Graeco-Sclavic world. After centuries passed in resignation and\r\nservitude, this world at last reaches the moment of renovation; what has\r\nso long been forgotten and down-trodden, comes back to the light and\r\nprepares for action. The present generations will see great changes,\r\ngreat facts, and great formations. Already on the peninsula of the\r\nBalkan, and under the worm-eaten couch of Ottoman tyranny, three groups\r\nof lively and strong nationalities are being formed, the Hellenic,\r\nSclavic, and Roumanian groups. Closely bound among themselves by the\r\ncommonalty of their faith and their historical destinies, these three\r\ngroups are equally connected with Russia by all the ties of religion and\r\nnational life. These three groups of nations once reconstructed, Russia\r\nwill reveal itself in an entirely different light. It will no longer be\r\nalone in the world; in place of a sombre, Asiatic power, as it now seems\r\nto be, it will become a moral force indispensable to Europe, a\r\nGraeco-Sclavic civilization completing the Latin-German civilization,\r\nwhich without it would remain imperfect and inert in its sterile\r\nexclusiveness.\" Soon after descending from these rather abstract heights\r\nto the more practical ground of ways and means, the fiery apostle of the\r\n_new era_ exclaimed on the 7th April: \"If France sustains by arms and by\r\nits political influence the _renaissance_ of the Latin races, if Prussia\r\nacts in the same manner _vis-a-vis_ to Germany, why, then, should not\r\nRussia, the only independent Sclavic Power, sustain the Sclavic races,\r\nand should it not prevent foreign Powers from placing obstacles in the\r\nway of their political development? Russia should employ all its powers\r\nto introduce in its neighbors of the South a transformation similar to\r\nthat which took place in Central and Occidental Europe; _vis-a-vis_ the\r\nSclavians it should take, without the least hesitation, the role which\r\nFrance has taken in regard to the Latin races and Prussia _vis-a-vis_\r\nthe German world. The task is a noble one, for _it is exempt from\r\negotism_: it is beneficial, for it will achieve the triumph of the\r\nprinciple of nationalities, and will give a solid basis to the modern\r\nequilibrium of Europe; it is worthy of Russia and of its greatness; it\r\nis immense, and we have the firm conviction that Russia will fulfill\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nIt was under the stimulant of such theories, hopes, and passions, that,\r\nin the spring of the year 1867, the strange _ethnological exposition of\r\nMoscow_[111] was instituted, which soon became the pretext for a great\r\ndemonstration from without, sufficiently inoffensive in appearance to\r\nremove all diplomatic embarrassment, well calculated, however, to\r\nproduce its effect on _naif_ and inflammable minds, to fascinate\r\nunfortunate, disinherited people, richer in imagination than in culture.\r\nCertainly, true science would draw very little profit from this\r\nprojected reunion in the _manege_ of Moscow of all the Sclavic \"types\"\r\nwith their costumes, their arms, their domestic utensils, and their\r\nflora; but the undertaking was considered not the less worthy of the\r\nmost august protection. The emperor and the empress offered considerable\r\nsums to defray the costs of the work, the Grand Duke Vladimir accepted\r\nthe honorary presidency of it, the high dignitaries of the court and the\r\nchurch charged themselves with its direction. Warm appeals were\r\naddressed to the Sclavians of Austria and Turkey, to their different\r\nhistorical, geographical, or other learned societies, to add by\r\nnumerous contributions to the magnificence of the exposition, and a\r\ncloud of emissaries collected in the countries of the Danube and of the\r\nBalkan in search of adhesion, samples, and \"types.\" Committees were\r\nformed in different parts of the empire, in order to worthily prepare\r\nthe reception of the \"Sclavic guests,\" who did not fail to swarm to the\r\n\"national jubilee,\" and soon a _congress_ was spoken of, in which should\r\nbe discussed the wants and the interests of so many \"brother peoples,\"\r\nthe hopes and the griefs of the great common country, of the _ideal_\r\ncountry. It was the moment, it is necessary to recall it, when the\r\nCretan insurrection, always persistent, stirred up by Greece, and\r\nexaggerated by the journals too little or too well informed, kept the\r\nChristian populations of Turkey in alarm and on their guard; the moment,\r\nalso, when the Czechen of Bohemia; urging on in consequence almost all\r\nthe Sclavians of Austria, protested against the Cisleithan constitution,\r\nand refused to sit in the representative chambers of the empire. The\r\n_Kremlin_ thus became the _mons sacer_ of the _intransigeans_ of the two\r\nbanks of the Leitha, the _congress of Moscow_ had all the appearance of\r\nan _opposition parliament_ opposed to the Reichsrath of Vienna, and the\r\nlanguage held by the authorized organs of the cabinet of St. Petersburg\r\nwas not calculated to calm the susceptibilities of the interested\r\ngovernments, nor to dissuade vexatious manifestations. Speaking of the\r\npious _pilgrims_ of Turkey and Austria who were preparing to visit\r\nMoscow, \"that holy Mecca of the Sclavians,\" the \"Correspondance Russe,\"\r\nthe ministerial journal _par excellence_,[112] thus expressed itself in\r\nthe month of April, 1867: \"One cannot reasonably demand of us that we\r\nabjure our past. We will let, then, our guests believe that they have\r\ncome to a sister nation _from whom they have everything to expect_ and\r\nnothing to fear; _we will listen to their grievances_, and the recital\r\nof their evils can only tighten the ties which unite us with them. If\r\nnow they intend to establish a comparison between their political state\r\nand ours, _we will not be foolish enough_ to prove to them that they are\r\nin the most favorable conditions of Sclavic development. These\r\nconditions, we believe, on the contrary, to be bad; we have said so a\r\nhundred times, and we can well say so again.\"\r\n\r\nWithout doubt the Russian intrigues in the countries of the Danube and\r\nthe Balkan were not of very recent invention; they even dated back very\r\nfar in the past, from the reign of the great Catherine. Underhandedly\r\nand secretly, the Pan-Sclavic propaganda had been encouraged or\r\nprotected for nearly a century; but it was for the first time, in this\r\nsummer of 1867, that the government of St. Petersburg thus loftily\r\nassumed the responsibility of such a propaganda, and unfurled in its\r\nstates the flags of Saints Cyrille and Methode. In an empire where all\r\nis watched, regulated, and commanded from the throne, where nothing is\r\ndone spontaneously, where all is arranged and _devised_, \"foreign\r\nSclavians,\" subjects of two neighboring and \"friendly\" Powers, were\r\nadmitted, encouraged to come to expose their grievances, to bring\r\ncomplaints against their respective governments, to demand assistance\r\nand deliverance in the name of a new right of nations, of a principle\r\nlately discovered of great combinations and national unities. _They were\r\nnot foolish enough_ to dismiss these foreign \"deputies,\" to counsel\r\nreason and resignation to them; on the contrary they spoke to them of a\r\n\"better and approaching condition,\" they took them through all the\r\ncities of the empire amidst enthusiastic manifestations directed by the\r\ncolonels and archimandrites, they overwhelmed them with testimonies of\r\nsympathy, ovations and demonstrations, in which the army, the\r\nmagistrates, and all the higher official world took part. Generals,\r\nadmirals, and ministers presided at banquets where the disaster of\r\nSadowa was celebrated as a providential and happy event by the subjects\r\nof the Emperor Francis Joseph, where appeals were addressed to the czar\r\n\"to revenge the secular outrages of the White Mountain and of Kossovo,\r\nand to plant the Russian banner on the Dardanelles, and on the basilica\r\nof St. Sophia.\" The shock given by such demonstrations to a whole race,\r\nto a whole religious world, was profound and prolonged, and certainly\r\nthe contemporaneous annals have rarely known a period as _incorrect_ in\r\npoint of view of international right and of the usages of the\r\nchancellors' offices as that which had for its starting point the\r\ncongress of Moscow and for its end the conference of Paris on the\r\nsubject of Greece. It was a strange one in truth, this epoch, with such\r\npresidents of the council as Ratazzi, Bratiano, Koumondouros, with\r\ngeneralissimos like Garibaldi, Petropoulaki, and \"Philip the\r\nBulgarian;\" with these expeditions of Mentana, of Sistow, of the\r\n_Arcadion_ and _Enosis_; with these agitations, to mention all, German,\r\nItalian, Czech, Croatian, Roumanian, Servian, Bulgarian, Grecian, and\r\nPan-Sclavic. Without entering farther into the tiresome history of these\r\ncomplex and not yet explained events, it suffices, in order to\r\nappreciate the general character of them and to comprehend their close\r\nties, to re-read with all the attention which it merits the report,\r\nalready mentioned, of the ambassador of France to the court of Berlin,\r\ndated the 5th January, 1868. \"M. de Bismarck must have,\" wrote M.\r\nBenedetti, \"a disturbed Italy, in permanent disagreement with France, to\r\nconstrain us to maintain forces more or less considerable in the States\r\nof the Holy See, to be able, if necessary, to excite, by the aid of the\r\nrevolutionary party, a violent rupture between the government of the\r\nemperor and that of King Victor Emmanuel, to neutralize, in a word, our\r\nliberty on the Rhine.... And I would not be surprised if M. de Bismarck\r\nwere the instigator of the new impulse given since last summer to the\r\nPan-Sclavic propaganda; he finds in it the immediate advantage of\r\ndisturbing Austria by Russia. Russia will assuredly show itself less\r\nenterprising, and Prussia on its part will not encourage it (Russia) to\r\nrenew the question of the Orient, for the simple reason that it itself\r\n(Prussia) would gain no advantage in it, if it did not think it\r\nindispensable to pay with this price for the liberty which it claims in\r\nGermany. The uncertainty of the situation only tightens every day the\r\nties which unite Prussia with Russia and solidifies the ambitions of the\r\none in Germany with those of the other in the Orient.\"\r\n\r\nA _permanent committee for the interests of Sclavic unity_ was formed on\r\nthe day after the congress of Moscow, under the auspices of a grand\r\nduke, and his action was not slow in making itself felt among the\r\nRuthenes, the Czechen, the Croatians of Austria; but it was especially\r\nin the tributary or subject provinces of the Ottoman Porte that the\r\nagitation became as chronic as it was perilous. The unfortunate Turk was\r\nassailed on all sides: one day it was the Vladika of Montenegro who\r\ndemanded of him in a menacing tone some port of the Adriatic, another\r\nday the Prince of Servia demanded the evacuation of some fortress,\r\nenforcing his request with extraordinary armaments. Numerous convoys of\r\narms arrived from Russia in the Danubian Provinces under the false\r\ndesignation of material for the construction of railroads,[113] while\r\nthe Greek ships of war did not cease to wish to rekindle with all their\r\nstrength in the isle of Crete an insurrection about to be extinguished\r\nand which, in truth, never was of very great extent. It was the epoch of\r\n\"committees of aid\" and \"liberating bands\" now overrunning the States of\r\nthe Pope with the cry \"_Roma o Morte!_\" now making incursions in\r\nThessaly to revenge \"the outraged manes of Phocion and Philopoemon,\" or\r\nagain freeing five times in the space of a year the Danube from the side\r\nof Roumania only to awaken in the Balkans \"the lion with the golden\r\nmane!\" \"To-day it is our duty, brothers, to prove to European diplomacy\r\nthat descendants of the terrible Krum still exist; the lion with the\r\ngolden mane and the trumpet of war call you.\" Thus read in the month of\r\nAugust, 1868, a proclamation dated from the \"Balkans,\" and signed\r\n\"_Provisional Government_.\"[114] \"It is a fact,\" wrote on the 6th\r\nFebruary, 1868, in a curious report addressed to Count de Beust by the\r\nagent of Austria in the Principalities, Baron d'Eder,--\"it is a fact\r\nthat at Bucharest, as in the different cities on the banks of the\r\nDanube, there exist Bulgarian committees; their object is to provoke\r\ntroubles in Bulgaria, to aid them, to give them more extended\r\nproportions than those of the past year. Only quite lately they were\r\npersuaded here that on the return of pleasant weather serious\r\ncomplications would break out in Occidental Europe which would permit\r\nRussia to declare war against Turkey, and, foreseeing these events, they\r\nhave made preparations to influence with energy the Bulgarian rising.\r\nAlthough the government of the Principalities is in the hands of a party\r\n(radical) traditionally hostile to Russia, it has nevertheless for some\r\ntime inclined towards this Power, and expects from it the realization of\r\nits efforts and its hopes. The journals of the opposition (conservative)\r\ncombat these Russophile tendencies of the government; they reproach it\r\nwith acting in concert with Prussia and with preparing difficulties for\r\nAustria in case of a conflict between France and Prussia. The journals\r\nof the government reply by saying that the national party is from\r\nprinciple the adversary of no Power, and that there is no reason for\r\ncombating Russia from the moment that this Power defends the cause of\r\nright and of oppressed nationalities.\"\r\n\r\nAssuredly it would be unjust to throw on the Russian government the\r\nresponsibility of all the disorderly agitations of this epoch in the\r\nSclavic-Graeco-Roumanian world, but it is not the less true that it did\r\nnothing to stop or even disown them. In looking over the parliamentary\r\ndocuments of this time,--the different blue, red, green, and yellow\r\nbooks of the years 1867-1869,--one is struck at meeting at every step\r\nrepeated and energetic representations, addressed by the cabinets of\r\nLondon, of the Tuileries, and of Vienna to Servia, Roumania, and to\r\nGreece concerning their military preparations, the clandestine shipments\r\nof arms and marauding bands, while the cabinets of St. Petersburg and\r\nBerlin carefully abstained from any proceeding of this sort. By a\r\npiquant change of things here below, which must have astonished the\r\nNesselrode and the Kamptz in their heavenly abode, the Occidental Powers\r\nnow, England and France, to whom also Austria joined itself, denounced\r\nto the world the revolutionary practices of the European demagogic\r\nparty, while Prussia kept silent, and Russia refused to deny the fact or\r\nto plead extenuating circumstances for it. The excuses for the\r\ngovernment of Athens Prince Gortchakof kindly found in the Hellenic\r\nconstitution: \"This constitution,\" said he, \"gives to all Greeks full\r\nliberty to leave their own country and to take part in any conflict such\r\nas existed in Crete;\"[115] and that was truly an original spectacle,\r\nthat of a minister of an autocracy displaying before an old whig like\r\nLord Clarendon the inexorable conditions of a parliamentary and legal\r\n_regime_. The Porte, it will be remembered, wished to know nothing of a\r\nlegality which destroyed it; it ended by losing patience, by addressing\r\nan _ultimatum_ to the government of Athens, and a conference assembled\r\nat Paris \"to seek for means to smooth over the difference between Turkey\r\nand Greece.\" Some good people apprehended an embarrassed attitude on the\r\npart of the Russian chancellor before such areopagus, they even believed\r\nhim capable of trammeling the labors of this reunion: this was to ignore\r\nthe resources of a mind as crafty as cultivated, and which profited by\r\nthe occasion to venture his famous _mot_ on Saturn. \"I remember,\" he\r\nwrote to Baron Brunnow, at London, 13th January, 1869, \"that there are\r\nsome persons who accuse Russia of wishing to render the conference\r\nabortive. One is not ignorant that the conference emanates from the mind\r\nof the emperor. The fable of Saturn has no application in the wanderings\r\nof the policy of the imperial cabinet.\" Alexander Mikhailovitch was not\r\nat the end of his boldness; he became bitter, almost aggressive; he\r\nspoke of the \"excitement from without,\" of a \"process of progress,\" of\r\nthe \"distrust which was attached to every step of Russia,\" and went so\r\nfar as to denounce a great conspiracy contrived by the Occidental Powers\r\nagainst the peace of the Levant. \"It is impossible for us not to\r\nremark,\" he said, in a dispatch to Baron de Brunnow, of the 17th\r\nDecember, 1868, \"that this discordant note is not the only one which has\r\ncome to _disturb the echoes of the Orient_. It is thus that we have\r\nfirst seen Servia become the end in view of an agitation which,\r\noriginated with the press, ended by gaining over diplomacy; Prince\r\nMichael Obrenovitch was suspected, and nothing less than his tragic end\r\nwas necessary to disarm the hostilities directed against him. Soon\r\nafter, accusations were directed against the government of the united\r\nPrincipalities: the Bulgarian bands became a motive for incrimination,\r\nit was reproached with having tolerated them, it was accused with having\r\nencouraged them. This complication was scarcely removed, before a new\r\ncrisis arose in the relations of Turkey with Greece, a crisis still more\r\ngrave and more dangerous to the general peace.\" Decidedly, in absence of\r\nthe \"fable of Saturn,\" that of the wolf and the lamb had its application\r\nin the wanderings of the policy of the imperial cabinet of St.\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nThe conference of Paris succeeded, nevertheless, in its efforts; the\r\nGraeco-Turkish difference was smoothed over, and with the spring of the\r\nyear 1869 the cold wind of the propaganda whistled less strongly in the\r\nvalleys of the Danube and the gorges of the Balkan. There was a sort of\r\nlull; but the combustible matters still remained heaped up, ready to\r\ncatch fire from the first spark. The radicals of Roumania were not the\r\nonly ones to foresee an offensive action of Russia in the Orient as soon\r\nas serious complications should break out in Occidental Europe; that was\r\nan almost universal conviction, and one which the children of Rourik\r\nshared the very first. The end of the year 1869 was signaled by an\r\nincident which did not fail to gravely impress all serious minds. They\r\ncelebrated at St. Petersburg the centennial of the institution of the\r\nOrder of St. George, the great military order of Russia, and of which\r\nthe first class is only conferred on him who gains a brilliant victory.\r\nThe Emperor Alexander II. sent this distinction to King William I., to\r\nthe conqueror of Sadowa and the former champion of 1814. \"Accept it,\" he\r\ntelegraphed him, \"as a new proof of the friendship which unites us, a\r\nfriendship founded on the souvenir of that great epoch when our united\r\narmies fought for a sacred cause which was common to us.\" And the King\r\nof Prussia soon replied by telegraph: \"Profoundly touched, and _with\r\ntears in my eyes_, I thank you for the honor which you have done me, and\r\nwhich I did not expect; but what pleases me still more are the\r\nexpressions by which you have announced it to me. I see, in truth, in\r\nthese expressions a new proof of your friendship and your remembrance of\r\nthe great epoch when our united armies fought for the same sacred\r\ncause.\"[116]\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the same year, and while the conference of Paris\r\nwas still sitting, there died at Nice a faithful servant of the\r\nsultan's, one of the last great statesmen of Turkey. Before descending\r\ninto the tomb, Fuad-Pacha traced with a faltering hand a memorial for\r\nhis august master, which he said was his political testament. The\r\ndocument was to remain secret, and, in fact, only came to light quite\r\nrecently.[117] \"When this writing is placed before the eyes of your\r\nmajesty,\" one reads in it, \"I will no longer be in this world. You can\r\ntherefore listen to me without distrust, and you should imbue yourself\r\nwith this great and grievous truth, that _the Empire of the Osmanlis is\r\nin danger_.\" And after having reviewed the different states of the\r\nContinent, and marked out the conflict more or less near, but\r\ninevitable, between France and Prussia, Fuad-Pacha concluded by these\r\nwords: \"An intestine dissension in Europe, and _a Bismarck in Russia_,\r\nand the face of the world will be changed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nGod alone could contemplate his finished work, and say \"that it was\r\ngood;\" our poor humanity rarely tastes such a pure enjoyment, and the\r\n_party of action_ in the councils of the second empire scarcely\r\nexperienced it in consequence of the events of 1866, which it had so\r\npowerfully contributed to create. The ambassador of France at the court\r\nof Berlin was among the number of the disabused; the achievement of\r\nItalian unity only consoled him, very imperfectly in truth, for the\r\nprofound blow which the calamity of Sadowa had given his own country.\r\nHis disenchantment was great; but there is nothing like a great and\r\ngrievous deception to sharpen and refine a mind naturally sagacious; and\r\nif Pascal has spoken of a second ignorance, that which comes after\r\nknowledge, there is also for certain diplomats a second knowledge, and\r\nlike a second sight after a passing blindness. One cannot praise too\r\nhighly the eminent qualities of observation and of judgment which M.\r\nBenedetti showed during the last four years of his embassy at Berlin,\r\nand, for this epoch of 1867 to 1870, history will fully confirm the\r\ntestimony which he once thought proper to testify of himself, while\r\nprotesting before his chief,[118] that during his mission in Prussia he\r\nhad been \"an active, correct, and far-seeing agent.\"\r\n\r\nFrom 1867, in fact, the ambassador worked with patriotic zeal to\r\nenlighten his government on the state of affairs in Europe, and to\r\nadvise it to make a strong resolution, either to resign itself frankly\r\nto the inevitable, or to prepare in good time for a conflict very\r\nimminent and full of great perils. He represented Prussia as working\r\nwithout cessation to unite all Germany, at the risk of provoking a\r\nconflict with France, inclining only too often to consider such a\r\nconflict as the surest and most direct means of arriving at its ends. In\r\nsuch a case, he guarded against giving them the least hope from the\r\n_particularists_ of the South. \"At the beginning of a national war,\" he\r\nsaid, \"the most obstinate among them will only be extinguished by the\r\nmasses who will regard the struggle, whatever may be the circumstances\r\nin the midst of which it will break out, as a war of aggression of\r\nFrance against their country; and if the fortune of arms were favorable\r\nto them, their demands would know no limits.\" He also noticed \"the most\r\nactive propaganda\" which M. de Bismarck maintained in the countries the\r\nother side of the Main: \"With the exception of some journals in the pay\r\nof the governments (of Munich and Stuttgart), or belonging to the\r\nultra-radical party, the press seconds him in all the Southern States.\"\r\nHe also sent word to Paris that the minister of William I. continued\r\nhis negotiations with the revolutionary party in Italy; that he received\r\nagents of Garibaldi, unknown to the regular government of King Victor\r\nEmmanuel, the personal friend of the Emperor Napoleon III., who, at the\r\ntime of the complications of Mentana, had only sounded Prussia in order\r\nto know \"in what measure it could lend it its aid.\"[119] He was also the\r\nfirst to give warning concerning the shadowy practices with Prim and the\r\nSpanish candidature of the Hohenzollern. Lastly, one has already seen\r\nthat he had recognized from the beginning the alarming character and\r\ntrue bearing of the mission of General Manteuffel to Russia.\r\n\r\n\"However difficult it may be for a great country like France to trace in\r\nadvance its line of conduct in the actual state of things,\" said M.\r\nBenedetti to his government at the beginning of the year 1868, \"and\r\nhowever great may be the part which it expects to take in unforeseen\r\ncontingencies, the union of Germany under a military government strongly\r\norganized, and which in certain respects has of parliamentary _regime_\r\nonly external forms, constitutes, however, a fact which touches too\r\nclosely our national security to allow us to dispense with preparations,\r\nand to solve, without longer delay, the following question: Would such\r\nan event endanger the independence or the position of France in Europe,\r\nand would not this danger be conjured up only by war? If the government\r\nof the emperor thinks that France has nothing to fear from such a\r\nradical alteration in the relations of the states situated in the centre\r\nof the Continent, it will be desirable, in my opinion, in the interest\r\nof the maintenance of peace and public prosperity, to shape entirely and\r\nwithout reserve our attitude according to this conviction. If the\r\ncontrary opinion is entertained, let us prepare for war without\r\ncessation, and let us be well assured in advance of what aid Austria can\r\nbe to us; let us shape our conduct so as to solve one after the other\r\nthe questions of the Orient and that of Italy; all our united forces\r\nwill not be too great to render us victorious on the Rhine.\"\r\n\r\nEspecially in his manner of judging of the accord established between\r\nthe two courts of Berlin and St. Petersburg, M. Benedetti showed a\r\njustness and superiority of judgment truly remarkable. He had the merit\r\nof foreseeing the understanding from the first moment, and of positively\r\nbelieving in it until the last. In the month of September, 1869, the\r\nEmperor of the French had thought of appointing as ambassador to the\r\nczar one of his most intimate friends, one of his most devoted\r\ncooperators of the 2d December, a general renowned for his bravery and\r\nintelligence, a grand equerry. It was sufficient to indicate that they\r\nwished to enter into relations as intimate and direct as possible, and\r\nin spite of the exchange of telegrams at the festival of St. George,\r\nthey were already, at the beginning of the year 1870, full of hope; they\r\nbelieved that _the affair was progressing of itself_.[120] The French\r\ngeneral, an able man, however, was very quickly taken to the bear hunts,\r\nto journeys on sledges, and shown many other marks of august kindness,\r\nwhich he had the modesty to credit to the policy of his master, in place\r\nof attributing them with much more reason to his very real and in truth\r\nvery fascinating personal charms. The conviction of the grand equerry\r\nwas shared by those surrounding him, especially by his aides-de-camp,\r\nwho did not delay to praise in their confidential letters addressed to\r\nParis, \"the great results obtained\" by their chief, and to speak of \"his\r\ngrowing favor with the Emperor of all the Russias,\" in terms very strong\r\nand much more military than diplomatic.[121] Without being imposed upon\r\nby all these recitals, full of cheerfulness, M. Benedetti did not the\r\nless persist in his well founded conviction; even on the 30th June,\r\n1870, on the very eve of the war, he expressed it in a lucid dispatch,\r\nfrom which we will have more than one instructive passage to quote.\r\nSpeaking of the recent interview (1st-4th June) of the Emperor Alexander\r\nand the King of Prussia at Ems, the ambassador supposes that M. de\r\nBismarck had shown himself then, as generally, on one side favorable to\r\nthe policy of the cabinet of St. Petersburg in the Orient, and that on\r\nthe other he endeavored to excite the susceptibility of the czar in the\r\nquestions which agitate the national sentiment in Russia as regards\r\nAustria, Galicia, etc. \"While the minister will have undertaken to\r\nreassure the emperor on the first of these two points and to alarm him\r\non the other, the king will have displayed that good grace of which he\r\nhas always known how to make such a marvelous use to capture the\r\nsympathies of his august nephew, and I do not doubt, for my part, that\r\nthey have left impressions in conformity with his desire. But whatever\r\nmay have been the means which they employed, their object must have been\r\nto strengthen the emperor in the sentiments which they have been able to\r\ninspire in him, and they have attained it more or less.\"\r\n\r\nM. Benedetti was, however, far from admitting an official arrangement\r\ndrawn up in due form between the two courts, and above all far from\r\nbelieving that the minister of Prussia had in all sincerity and candor\r\nmade the cession and abandonment of the Oriental heritage to the hands\r\nof his former colleague of Frankfort, and it is precisely in such\r\nestimates that the uncommon perspicacity of the French diplomat shows\r\nitself. M. de Bismarck could for the necessities of the moment, simulate\r\nindifference regarding the affairs of the Levant, affirm that he \"never\r\nread the correspondence of Constantinople,\" and even consider the\r\npretensions of Russia \"to introduce a certain unity in the intellectual\r\ndevelopment of the Sclavians, legitimate;\"[122] but the extreme care\r\nwhich he used at the same time to maintain the most intimate relations\r\nwith the Hungarians, his allies of 1866, should have already enlightened\r\nthe zealots of Moscow concerning the inanity of their dream of a\r\ndivision of the world between the sons of Teut and those of Rourik. \"The\r\nHungarians regard us, us Prussians, as their mediate protectors against\r\nVienna in the future,\" wrote, in a confidential dispatch, Baron de\r\nWerther in the month of June, 1867, on his return from the coronation of\r\nBuda, to reassure the cabinet of Berlin on the recent enthusiasm of the\r\nMagyars reconciled with their \"king;\" it is not only against Vienna, it\r\nis still much more against Moscow and St. Petersburg, against any\r\nSclavic preponderance on the banks of the Danube, that the children of\r\nArpad will in the future have aid from the Hohenzollern. \"Prussia has no\r\nrightful interests in the Orient,\" M. de Bismarck was pleased to say in\r\nthe years 1867-1870, and the organ of M. de Katkof did not cease to\r\nrepeat this remark so often commented on; but from the day when Prussia\r\nidentified itself with Germany, or rather incorporated itself in it, it\r\nremained charged, under pain of forfeiture, with the Germanic interests\r\nand influences in the countries of the Danube and of the Balkan, and the\r\ninterest then became greater, much greater, than that of France and\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAll this was very well understood by the ambassador of France to the\r\ncourt of Berlin, and from time to time keenly exposed in the dispatches\r\nwhich he addressed to his government during the last years of his\r\nmission in Prussia. Writing, in his report of the 5th January, 1868, of\r\nthe complaisance with which the chancellor of the confederation of the\r\nNorth always lent himself to the views of Prince Gortchakof, M.\r\nBenedetti added, however: \"He (M. de Bismarck) persuades himself without\r\ndoubt that other Powers have an interest of the first order in\r\npreserving the Ottoman empire from the covetousness of Russia, and he\r\nabandons the care of it to them; he knows, moreover, that _nothing can\r\nbe definitely accomplished there without the aid or the adhesion of\r\nGermany, if Germany is united and strong_; he believes, then, that he\r\ncan, for the present, and without peril, himself sharpen the ambition of\r\nthe cabinet of St. Petersburg, provided that he obtains in return for\r\nthis condescension a kind withdrawal from everything which he undertakes\r\nin Germany.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the Orient,\" wrote the ambassador some time after (4th February,\r\n1868), \"M. de Bismarck is careful to preserve a position which does not\r\nbind him in any way, and permits him, according to the necessities of\r\nhis own designs, to give the hand to Russia, or to ally himself with\r\nOccidental Powers; but he can only preserve this position by abstaining\r\nfrom any proceeding which would compromise him with the friends or the\r\nadversaries of Turkey.\" This reasoning was not long in being fully\r\njustified by the attitude of Prussia, during the conference of Paris, on\r\nthe subject of Greece (January, 1869). The cabinet of Berlin did not\r\nshare in the ardor of Alexander Mikhailovitch; it did not defend, as he\r\ndid, persecuted innocence in the person of \"the young Roumania,\" and of\r\nthe Servian _Omladina_, and above all was careful to denounce the great\r\nconspiracy of England, France, and Austria against the peace of the\r\nLevant. In reality the minister of Prussia did not wish the death of the\r\njust Osmanli, still less the collapse of Hungary, the advance guard of\r\nthe Germanic \"mission\" in the East;[123] and his sympathies for a\r\n\"certain ideal unity\" of the Sclavians grew cold in proportion as the\r\nhour of the real unity of Germany approached. \"Any conflict in the\r\nOrient will put it under the influence of Russia,\" wrote the French\r\ndiplomat the 27th January, 1870, \"and he will seek to excite it; he\r\ntried it last year at the beginning of the Graeco-Turkish trouble.\r\n_Russia is a card in his game_ for the eventualities which may arise on\r\nthe Rhine, _and he is particularly careful not to change the roles_, not\r\nto become himself a card in the game of the cabinet of St. Petersburg.\"\r\n\r\nSome months after, on the very eve of the war with France (30th June,\r\n1870), M. Benedetti, while thinking that the ties between Russia and\r\nPrussia could only have been drawn closer in the recent interview of\r\nEms, concluded by the following observations: \"It must not be supposed,\r\nhowever, that M. de Bismarck thinks it opportune to connect his policy\r\nclosely with that of the Russian cabinet. In my opinion, he has not\r\ncontracted and is not disposed to make any engagement which might, while\r\ncompromising Prussia in the complications of which Turkey will become\r\nthe scene, draw France and England closer together, and create\r\ndifficulties for him or weaken him on the Rhine. The kind feelings of\r\nthe chancellor of the confederation of the North for Russia will never\r\nbe of a nature to limit his liberty of action; _he promises in fact\r\nmore than he means to do_, or, in other words, he seeks the alliance\r\nwith the cabinet of St. Petersburg to gain for himself the benefit of it\r\nin case of a conflict in the Occident, but with the well-fixed\r\nresolution never to engage the resources or the forces of Germany in the\r\nOrient. I have also always been persuaded that no official arrangement\r\nhas been concluded between the two courts, and we can certainly believe\r\nthat they did not consider that at Ems.\"\r\n\r\nEverything, in fact, leads us to believe that neither a treaty was\r\nsigned there, nor conditions discussed; the commonalty of views and the\r\nharmony of hearts dispensed with a fatiguing discussion of details.\r\nMoreover, it would have been very difficult, in all the useless cases,\r\nto make stipulations _en regle_ for the eventualities, the time of whose\r\nappearance is not known, of which it is impossible to calculate the\r\ndistant consequences, or even the immediate effects. They contented\r\nthemselves with the conviction that they had no opposite interests;\r\nthat, on the contrary, they were congenial and sympathetic, and that it\r\nwas understood that at the propitious moment each one would be for\r\nhimself and God for all. It must also be acknowledged that the Russians,\r\nin their views concerning the Orient, are not exempt from certain\r\n_mirages_. Europe credits them with much more method than they have in\r\nreality: the sentiment is profound and tenacious, but the plans are as\r\nwavering as they are different and vague. One might say that this great\r\npeople suffer in this regard rather from a fascination and almost a\r\nfatality which prevents them from pursuing a systematic conquest; it\r\nadvances on the phantom which possesses it only to make it recoil. It\r\nis a matter worthy of notice that Russia is never so far removed from\r\nthe goal as when it undertakes to force the _denoument_. In 1829, a few\r\nhalting places only separated its armies from Constantinople, and they\r\nturned back. It lost, in 1854, all the fruit of its campaign in Hungary,\r\nand of its ascendency in consequence of the catastrophe of February,\r\nwhile its prospects were never as brilliant as on the day when the\r\ntreaty of Paris expected to close the Black Sea to it. It lost\r\nSebastopol, but it gained the Caucasus and a whole world on the banks of\r\nthe Amour and the Syr-Daria. The temptation became then very natural in\r\npresence of the formidable conflict which since 1867 was preparing in\r\nthe centre of Europe, rather to await events than to wish to regulate\r\nthem and to prescribe their course. In a war between the two strongest\r\nPowers of the Continent, which promised to be as long as desperate, and\r\nwhich in the end might well equally exhaust the two adversaries and draw\r\nseveral other states into the lists, Russia--thus they surely thought on\r\nthe banks of the Neva--would always find the opportunity and the means\r\nof saying its word and securing its booty. Such a line of conduct seemed\r\nentirely marked out for a chancellor to whom so much good fortune had\r\nalready come while \"meditating;\" it recommended itself to a policy which\r\nonly measured the infinity of its aspirations by the uncertainty of\r\npossible events. The infinity of desires accommodates itself in case one\r\ncan do nothing better with the indefinite in the designs, and nothing at\r\ntimes gives such a false impression of depth as emptiness.\r\n\r\nIt was cruelly ironic of the founder of German unity to choose in each\r\nof his successive enterprises an accomplice who was to become his victim\r\nin the following undertaking; but he showed, also, his great superiority\r\nin having had each time a very clear aim, a well-defined object marked\r\nout, and, so to speak, tangible, while his partners allowed themselves\r\nto be drawn in, one after the other, in the perilous game, under the\r\nimpulse of abstract principles, vague desires, and cloudy combinations.\r\nAt the time of the invasion of the Duchies and his first attempt against\r\nthe equilibrium of Europe, M. de Bismarck was certainly not at a loss to\r\nshow his aim: the prey was in reach of his hands, and the roadstead of\r\nKiel spread itself in all its splendor before whoever had eyes to see;\r\nbut M. de Rechberg is still seeking for it to-day, and to make the\r\nmotives of his cooperation in this work of iniquity acceptable. \"He\r\ntried to master the demagogic passions, to gain the ascendency over the\r\nrevolution,\"--these are the pompous and sonorous phrases taken from the\r\n\"doctrine\" with which later the former Austrian minister was to seek to\r\ncover up before the Austro-Hungarian delegations his fatal and pitiful\r\npolicy of 1863. At Biarritz, the president of the Prussian council\r\ndemanded in very clear terms the line of the Main for his country, while\r\nthe dreamer of Ham recommended \"the great war for the German\r\nnationality,\" and let his undecided glance fall first on the right bank\r\nof the Rhine and Mayence, then on the limits of 1814, and only fixed it\r\non the winged lion of St. Mark. From 1867 to 1870, the chancellor of the\r\nNorthern Confederation resolutely made preparations for the unification\r\nof Germany and the conquest of Alsace and Lorraine, leaving to his\r\nformer colleague of Frankfort perfect leisure \"to awaken the echoes of\r\nthe Orient,\" and to demand of them the key to the approaching destinies\r\nof Russia. In each of these fatidical circumstances, the same great\r\n_realist_ is always leading the ideologists to different degrees and to\r\ndifferent titles: it is always the same Fortinbras of Shakspere,--the\r\n_fort en bras_ of Germany,--proclaiming his dominion where the\r\ndoctrinary, melancholy, or word-making Hamlets have only lost their way\r\nin chimerical and puerile machinations, and, before a \"murder which\r\ncries out to heaven,\" find no other words than,--the time is out of\r\njoint!\r\n\r\n\"Russia cannot feel any alarm at the power of Prussia,\"[124] said Prince\r\nGortchakof, in reply to the representations which were made him from the\r\nbeginning of the Hohenzollern affair on \"the danger which would result\r\nto Russia from the aggrandizement of Prussia, and from the extension of\r\nits influence in Europe.\" As to the Spanish candidature of the Prussian\r\nprince, the chancellor recalled that \"when Prince Charles of\r\nHohenzollern became (in 1866) sovereign of Roumania, with the support of\r\nFrance and in spite of Russia, this latter had limited itself to\r\nremonstrances, and had then accepted the fact, he did not see why to-day\r\nPrussia could be more responsible for the election of another member of\r\nthe royal family to the throne of Spain.\" Thus spoke the minister of the\r\nczar at the very beginning of the conflict, the 8th July, 1870, before\r\nthe renunciation of Prince Anthony, before any exhibition of anger on\r\nthe part of the cabinet of the Tuileries, and at the moment when Europe\r\nstill thought well of the legitimate susceptibilities of France.\r\nHowever, when the hour of blindness and giddiness came, and when the\r\ngovernment of Napoleon III. lost all the profit of a great diplomatic\r\nsuccess by its provoking language before the legislative body, by its\r\ndemands of Ems, and its fatal declaration of war (15th July), illusions\r\ncould no longer be cherished concerning the true sentiments of the\r\ncabinet of St. Petersburg. \"With all due deference to General Fleury,\"\r\nwrote with humor M. de Beust to Prince de Metternich, the 20th July,\r\n\"Russia perseveres in its alliance with Prussia so far, that in certain\r\neventualities the intervention of the Muscovite arms must be looked upon\r\nnot as probable, but as _certain_.\" Soon after the declarations of war\r\nof the 15th July, the Russian government had addressed to Vienna the\r\nvery clear and categorical notice that it would not allow Austria to\r\nmake common cause with France. General Fleury was even soon to think\r\nhimself lucky with having at least made sure that this invalidating\r\nclause touching the empire of the Hapsburg was not explicitly mentioned\r\nin the declaration of neutrality which the Emperor Alexander II.\r\npublished the 23d July.[125]\r\n\r\n\"Russia has done us much harm,\" said the Duke de Gramont, in regard to\r\nthis interdicting command to Austria.[126] It weighed equally on the\r\ncourt of Copenhagen and forced it to neutrality, in spite of all the\r\nenthusiasm of the unfortunate Scandinavian people for an alliance with\r\nwhich was connected a French plan of a landing in the North, an\r\nenterprise of the greatest strategical interest, General Trochu said,\r\nwho was to have taken part in it. \"Russia,\" thought with an official\r\njournal of the country, the ambassador of the United States at St.\r\nPetersburg, \"has contributed more to the neutrality than any other\r\nnation; by its menaces it has forced Austria not to move, and it has\r\nsucceeded, by the influence of the emperor and the hereditary prince, in\r\nhindering Denmark from taking part with France.\"[127] England, it is\r\njust to add, powerfully seconded in all this the Russian chancellor. It\r\nwas more prejudiced than ever against France, thanks to the recent and\r\nterrible revelations of M. de Bismarck concerning the _dilatory\r\nnegotiations_ in August, 1866, on the subject of Belgium. It was evident\r\nthat for the pleasure of Prince Gortchakof the conflagration came much\r\ntoo soon. The military preparations of Russia were not made; even the\r\nperfectly \"moral\" action on the Sclavic world had undergone a rest since\r\nthe conference on the subject of Greece. M. de Bismarck had not exactly\r\nconsulted the convenience of his colleague on the Neva. As M. Benedetti\r\nhad predicted, he had taken care not to invert the _roles_ and thought\r\nonly of his own convenience and opportunities; but Alexander\r\nMikhailovitch did not the less apply himself to play his _role_\r\naccording to his strength. A sagacious observer, the ambassador of the\r\nUnited States, already mentioned, wrote about this time from St.\r\nPetersburg to his government: \"The general opinion here seems to be\r\nthat, if Russia were ready, it would declare war and try to gain certain\r\nadvantages from it.... The government is making great efforts to prepare\r\nfor future events. The cartridge factories work night and day. An order\r\nfor a hundred Gattling cannon has just been sent to America.\" They\r\narmed, they deterred or intimidated the probable allies of France,\r\nthinking thus to equalize for the moment the chances between the two\r\nbelligerents,[128] and they still hoped to find more than one favorable\r\nopportunity in the midst of the numerous events of a war which Napoleon\r\nIII. himself proclaimed must be \"long and difficult.\"\r\n\r\nThe terrible disasters of France in the beginning of the campaign\r\nsuddenly arrested the imaginations in their flight and dissipated the\r\nsublime vision of a \"new Graeco-Sclavic world,\" which since 1867 had\r\nhaunted the minds of those on the banks of the Moscova and the Neva.\r\nWith the marvelous political and _realistic_ aptitude which\r\ndistinguishes it, the Russian nation soon understood that for the moment\r\nany crusade in the Orient was impossible, that the destiny of the world\r\nwas being decided at the foot of the Vosges, and that it must attend to\r\nthe most urgent and reasonable claims. A curious phenomenon, the\r\npeninsula of the Balkan was never as relatively quiet, as little\r\ntormented by the \"great idea\" as during these years 1870-1871, during\r\nthis \"intestine dissension in Europe\" which Fuad-Pacha when dying had so\r\nfeared for the empire of the Osmanlis. Towards the end of the month of\r\nAugust, still before the catastrophe of Sedan, public opinion in Russia\r\ncared only for the displeasing article of the treaty of Paris on the\r\nsubject of the Euxine. \"Russia,\" said an influential journal of St.\r\nPetersburg,[129] \"has not hindered the forced unification of Germany,\r\nand, in its turn, _it does not dream of the forced unification of the\r\nSclavians_; but it has the right to demand that its position on the\r\nBlack Sea and the banks of the Danube be ameliorated. We hope that its\r\nlegitimate demands will be taken into consideration in the European\r\ncongress which will probably follow the present war.\" A European\r\ncongress! that was in truth the only logical issue, however unreassuring\r\nin such grave events, disturbers of the equilibrium of the world; and it\r\nmust render this justice to the greater part of the Russias, that they\r\nhave the true appreciation of the situation, and aspire to a _role_ as\r\nlegitimate as honorable. They wish to attain a satisfaction of\r\n_amour-propre_; but they did not wish to sacrifice France and the\r\ngeneral interests of the Continent to it; the little question was in\r\ntheir eyes only the corollary of the great. At Constantinople one did\r\nnot augur otherwise from the line of conduct which the cabinet of St.\r\nPetersburg undoubtedly pursued, although dreading it. On the 2d\r\nSeptember, Mr. Joy Morris, minister of the United States to the Porte,\r\nwrote to his government that the general conviction on the Bosphorus was\r\nthat Russia would profit by the crisis to bring about the revision of\r\nthe treaty of 1856. \"It would be strange if it did not succeed in it,\"\r\nadded the \"Yankee\" diplomat, \"seeking, as it will, to obtain honorable\r\nconditions of peace for France, and exercising a dominating influence on\r\nthe regulations of the terms of peace.\" Unfortunately, and for the first\r\ntime in his long and popular reign at the chancellor's palace, the\r\n\"national minister\" divorced himself on this occasion from the sentiment\r\nof the nation, and in place of acting as \"a good European,\" according to\r\nthe favorite expression of M. de Talleyrand, he sought above all to show\r\nhimself the good friend of his former colleague of Frankfort. He took\r\ncare to renounce the question of the Black Sea,--he owed his country\r\nthis little consolation after such great mistakes,--but he resolved to\r\nseparate two causes which public opinion in Russia demanded to have\r\nunited; and it demanded it with an idea much more politic than generous,\r\nin an instinct much more sensible for the vital interests of the future\r\nthan for the satisfaction more or less lively of the present moment. He\r\nthought that he could not better serve the Russian cause on the Euxine,\r\nthan in injuring as much as possible the cause of Europe in Alsace and\r\nLorraine, and he endeavored above all to let France and Prussia fight\r\nout their quarrel in single combat. Immediately after the first French\r\ndisasters, he seized with _empressement_ the ingeniously perfidious idea\r\nof the _league of neutrals_, originally an Italian idea, naturalized in\r\nEngland by Earl Granville, and soon became in the hands of the Russian\r\nchancellor, as was very acutely remarked, the most efficacious means to\r\n\"organize impotence in Europe.\" M. de Beust had vainly essayed, _while\r\nadopting the principle_ of the English proposition (19th August) to\r\nchange the character of it, to make it the point of departure of a\r\nconcerted intervention; he demanded \"efforts not separated, but common\r\nin view of a mediation,\" in place of a ridiculous conception which only\r\n\"leagued\" the states to prevent any collective proceeding. \"The\r\ncombination which the minister of Austria then suggested,\" wrote on this\r\nsubject a judicious historian, \"was repeated again and again by him\r\nduring the whole duration of the war. If it had been adopted, it would\r\nhave changed the course of things. One can say that it is for this\r\nreason that Europe did not adopt it.\"[130]\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that Prince Gortchakof especially opposed it from\r\nthe first day to the last. There was a moment when England itself felt\r\nsome qualms of conscience and showed a wish for mediation. That was at\r\nthe beginning of the month of October, after a circular of M. de\r\nBismarck had announced to Europe the conditions of peace of Germany,\r\nwhich were Alsace and Lorraine. \"The ambassador of Prussia communicated\r\nthis circular to the Russian government, and Prince Gortchakof abstained\r\nfrom making his impressions known. Sir A. Buchanan said to him then,\r\nthat at London they were disposed to be governed in a certain measure by\r\nwhat was done at St. Petersburg. The chancellor replied simply that\r\nPrussia, not having asked of him his opinion, he had not given it.[131]\r\nEarl Granville had the, for him, extraordinary courage to return again\r\nto the charge, and Sir A. Buchanan read to the Russian chancellor a\r\nmemorandum timidly asking \"if it would not be possible for England and\r\nRussia to arrive at an agreement concerning the conditions under which\r\npeace could be concluded, and then to make, with the other neutral\r\nPowers, an appeal to the humanity of the King of Prussia, also\r\nrecommending moderation to the French government.\" Prince Gortchakof\r\ngave to those overtures a dry and disdainful reception. Prussia, said\r\nhe, has indicated its conditions of peace; a victory alone can modify\r\nthem, and this victory is not probable. Confidential conversations\r\nbetween England and Russia will be then without object; common\r\nrepresentations would always have a more or less menacing character.\r\nIsolated action of each of the neutral Powers before the King of Prussia\r\nis preferable.[132] Isolated action! Alexander Mikhailovitch was not\r\nmoved, and for Russia this action was summed up in several personal\r\nletters addressed by the august nephew to his royal uncle, very\r\ncharming letters, which recommended peace, justice, humanity, and\r\nmoderation, and to which the conqueror of Sedan always replied\r\naffectionately, with a moved heart and with tears in his eyes, pleading\r\nhis duties to his allies, his armies, his people, and his\r\nfrontiers.[133] It was this \"policy of euphemism,\" as the historian has\r\nso well called it, which they did not cease to practice, during the\r\nentire war, on the banks of the Neva, towards General Fleury as well as\r\ntowards M. Thiers and M. de Gabriac, and the last word as well as the\r\nfirst thought of \"action\" of Prince Gortchakof was to leave France alone\r\nwith its conqueror, alone till exhaustion, _usque ad finem_. It is known\r\nin what terms this end was announced at St. Petersburg. \"It is with\r\ninexpressible feeling and returning thanks to God,\" the Emperor of\r\nGermany telegraphed from Versailles to the Emperor of Russia, on the\r\n26th February, 1871, \"that I announce to you that the preliminaries of\r\npeace have just been signed. Prussia will never forget that it owes to\r\nyou that the war has not taken extreme dimensions. May God bless you for\r\nit. Your grateful friend for life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Long and disastrous\" was this war, alas! as the unhappy Caesar had well\r\npredicted, long enough at least to let Europe measure all the depth of\r\nits abasement, and \"to give it all the time to blush at nothing,\"\r\naccording to the strong expression of the poet. Still more humiliating,\r\nperhaps, than this abasement, is the thought of the perfect similarity\r\nof the two terrible catastrophes which succeeded one another in the\r\ninterval of scarcely four years; in producing its second tragedy so soon\r\nafter the first, destiny was sufficiently disdainful to our generation\r\nnot to even change the procedure or bestow any care on the imagination.\r\nThe work of 1870 was only the exact copy of that of 1866. You will take\r\nthe Orient, M. de Bismarck said at St. Petersburg, through General\r\nManteuffel, as on the shore of Biarritz he had told the Emperor Napoleon\r\nIII. to take Belgium, always making the same gift of the property which\r\ndid not belong to him, the same gracious gift of the fruit defended by\r\nthe dragon. The dreamers of Moscow believed in a _new era_, in a new\r\n\"Graeco-Sclavic-Roumanian world,\" as Napoleon III. had thought of a\r\nEurope remodeled after the principle of nationalities. \"Russia will not\r\nfeel any alarm at the power of Prussia,\" Prince Gortchakof declared at\r\nthe beginning of the Hohenzollern affair, exactly as the zealots of the\r\n_new right_ had affirmed of France on the eve of the campaign of\r\nBohemia. In both of the terrible years they had counted on the events\r\nand opportunities of a war, slow and of divers fortunes; they had even\r\nmade it a study to derisively equalize the chances of the belligerents,\r\nand the surprise and the fright were not less great at St. Petersburg\r\nafter Reichshoffen and Sedan than it had been at Paris after Nahod and\r\nSadowa. The military preparations were wanting in Russia in 1870, as in\r\nFrance in 1866, and after the one as after the other of the calamities\r\nwhich desolated and overturned the world, they had only egotistical and\r\npetty thoughts; they prevented designedly any collective intervention,\r\nthey aided Prussia in _freeing itself from all European control_; in a\r\nword they sacrificed the policy of justice, preservation, and\r\nequilibrium to a calculation as false as sordid, and which the great\r\nhumorist of Varzin had one day called the _politique de pour-boire_.\r\n\r\nThe Russian chancellor, it is just to acknowledge, was happier after\r\nSedan than Napoleon III. had been after Sadowa: he had his Luxemburg, he\r\ncould proclaim the abrogation of Article II. of the treaty of Paris,\r\n\"the abrogation of a theoretical principle without immediate\r\napplication,\" as he himself said in an official document.[134] One knows\r\nthe judgment which at that time the cabinets gave on this \"conquest\"\r\npurely nominal in reality, and extremely small in any case in proportion\r\nto all those which Alexander Mikhailovitch had allowed to his former\r\ncolleague of Frankfort. He succeeded, but not by legitimate means, by\r\nthat action of _eclat_ and equity which one had hoped for in Russia,\r\ndreaded at Constantinople; he did not provoke the revision of the treaty\r\nof 1856, in \"seeking to obtain honorable conditions of peace for France\r\nand in exercising a dominating influence on the regulation of the terms\r\nof peace.\"[135] He chose precisely \"the psychological moment\" of the\r\ndefeats of France, of the disorder of Europe and of the gloomy shock to\r\npublic right, to give it in his turn a humiliating blow, a _telum\r\nimbelle_, but not _sine ictu_. He freed himself and his own chief from\r\nan engagement contracted with the Powers, as he had freed his friend of\r\nBerlin from any control of Europe. \"The procedure of Russia,\" said Earl\r\nGranville, in his remarkable dispatch of the 10th November to Sir A.\r\nBuchanan, \"breaks all the treaties: the object of a treaty is to bind\r\nthe contracting parties one to the other; according to the Russian\r\ndoctrine, each party submits all to his own authority, and holds himself\r\nbound only to himself.\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1868, an eminent man whom the disasters of\r\nhis country were soon to restore to the political life which the second\r\nempire closed to him, rose even here[136] with passionate eloquence\r\nagainst \"the growing mistrust of this elementary right which honor and\r\ngood public sense have called the faith of treaties.\" \"We see,\" said he,\r\n\"creating itself every day under our eyes, a fruitful jurisprudence\r\nwhose rapid development does not astonish those who know what force\r\nfalse principles borrow from and lend in turn to the passions which they\r\nfavor. Only a few years ago they imposed on this unilateral resilition\r\nof reciprocal treaties some conditions which made the usage of them more\r\nlegitimate, or at least more rare and less perilous. They still wished\r\ngreatly to admit that, in case one state should want to repudiate a\r\ntreaty signed by representatives regularly accredited, it should be\r\nnecessary that in its interior one of those great overturnings of\r\ninstitutions, persons, and things should be effected which is called a\r\nrevolution. A revolution was a sheriff's summons by which a nation made\r\nknown to whom it should concern its intention to put itself into\r\nbankruptcy and to no longer pay its debts. This was, it seems to me, a\r\nsufficiently great facility, but the last form of new right does not\r\nfind it sufficient to its taste. The formality of a revolution is\r\nembarrassing and costly to carry out. A change of ministry, or, better\r\nstill, a vote of parliament causes less inconvenience. Nothing more will\r\nbe necessary henceforward in order that a convention in which God,\r\nhonor, and conscience have been taken to witness the past year be\r\ntrampled under foot the following year.\"\r\n\r\nWell! we have lived through enough, since the time when an honest\r\nconscience uttered this cry of alarm, to see foreign jurisprudence arise\r\nwithout even the formality of a revolution, of a change of ministry or a\r\nvote of parliament, to hear it proclaimed by the minister of a regular\r\nabsolute monarchy, by a Russian chancellor. It is true that the Italians\r\nalso then hastened to profit by the misfortunes of France, to break in\r\ntheir turn a solemn engagement made with it in a public document, that\r\nin 1870 they had even anticipated Prince Gortchakof in a proceeding well\r\nknown to them; but it was not from a government born yesterday that the\r\nsuccessor of Count Nesselrode should have borrowed the procedures. There\r\nwas a day when Alexander Mikhailovitch reproached this very government\r\nwith _moving with the revolution to reap the heritage of it_.[137]\r\nSince then he has also moved with the revolution,--with one of the most\r\naudacious, most violent revolutions which has ever overturned thrones\r\nand kingdoms; he has reaped no heritage from it, it is true (it is only\r\ntoo often so in life, as one knows), he only accepted from it a gracious\r\nlegacy, a legitimate donation, a modest gift in fact, and out of\r\nproportion to services rendered, but which was not the less sullied with\r\nundue influences, and which injured the right of the third parties, the\r\nright of nations.\r\n\r\nHow otherwise great and glorious might have been the \"conquests\" of\r\nAlexander Mikhailovitch, if, inspiring himself, in the month of October,\r\n1870, with the legitimate ambition of the Russian people, the \"national\r\nminister\" had brought about a concerted action of Europe in order to\r\nproduce peace between France and Germany, and to regulate the troubled\r\naffairs of the Continent! \"We have always been of the opinion,\" wrote M.\r\nde Beust, on the 10th September, to St. Petersburg, \"that it is for\r\nRussia to take the initiative.\" Its great influence abroad, its security\r\nin the interior, its good relations with the conqueror, assigned to it\r\nin truth such an initiative, and certainly neither Austria, Italy, nor\r\nEngland would have hesitated to range themselves under its banner. There\r\nwas no necessity for a menacing intervention, nor even for that armed\r\nneutrality which M. Disraeli recommended:[138] the wish firmly expressed\r\nby all the Powers of the Continent would have fully sufficed. They could\r\nhave thus limited the losses of France, given to Germany a less\r\nformidable organization, more in harmony with the aspirations and\r\nliberal occupations of our century,--the great vassals of the new\r\nemperor would not have failed to lend their aid to it,--a general\r\ndisarmament would have given to a generation cruelly tried, and which\r\nnow cannot even rest in its sterility, a reparative and a fruitful work.\r\nAnd who would dare to doubt that after such services Russia would not\r\nhave obtained of Europe the grateful abrogation of that onerous article\r\nof the treaty of 1856? France would certainly not have thought of\r\nopposing it; Austria would not have maintained a clause which it had\r\ncombated from the beginning, and which, four years before, it had\r\nsolemnly declared to be \"only a question of _amour-propre_,\" whose\r\ngravest interests demanded the sacrifice; as to England, it is well\r\nknown that in course of time it accommodates itself to everything. How\r\nmuch such a benefit procured for humanity by a monarchical government,\r\nabsolute indeed, would have given force to the cause of order and\r\npreservation, of rejuvenation of monarchical principles! with what\r\nprestige it would have surrounded the Russian people; what imperishable\r\nsplendor it would have attached to the name of Alexander II! The call of\r\ndestiny was very manifest; the _role_ as plain as easy: the successor of\r\nCount Nesselrode shrunk from it. It was only a sin of omission, if you\r\nwill, but of that sort which the sublime lover of justice Alighieri did\r\nnot pardon when they were committed against his ideal of _justitia et\r\npax_. On such a sin he inflicted the name of _il gran rifiuto_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[100] Dispatch of Count de Muelinen to Baron de Beust, 30th December,\r\n1866.\r\n\r\n[101] Dispatch of M. de Beust to Baron de Prokesch at Constantinople,\r\nJanuary 22, 1867.\r\n\r\n[102] \"What alarms me the most, is the considerable change which the\r\npacification of the provinces of the Caucasus has given to the situation\r\nof Russia.

Germany\r\ncelebrated the _fete_ of its new emperor with transports of joy, the\r\nmore noisy and sincere since the monarch had waited for this anniversary\r\nto ratify a last convention with the government of Versailles, a\r\nconvention which assured the anticipated payment of the fifth milliard\r\nof the French ransom, and the very early return of the troops of\r\noccupation from the other side of the Vosges. The great accounts with\r\n_the hereditary enemy_ thus definitely settled, the conqueror of Sedan\r\nthought, on his part, of acquitting himself of a little debt of the\r\nheart: he resolved to carry to the Emperor Alexander II. the expression\r\nof his lively gratitude for the loyal aid which he had lent him during a\r\nmemorable period of trials and combats. Long foreseen, from time to time\r\nannounced and put off, the journey to St. Petersburg was at length\r\nundertaken at the beginning of pleasant weather, and M. de Bismarck took\r\ncare to state precisely on this occasion the date as well as the\r\ncharacter of the close association of interests established between\r\nRussia and Prussia, and which became so fatal to the Occident. \"The\r\ncommonalty of views,\"--thus the official organ of the German chancellor\r\nexpressed itself,[139]--\"which brought about the alliance of Prussia and\r\nRussia in 1863, at the time of the Polish insurrection, was the point of\r\ndeparture for this present policy of the two states, which, on the\r\noccasion of the great events of the last years, has affirmed its power.\r\nSince the attitude of Russia in the question of Schleswig-Holstein, up\r\nto the important proofs of sympathy given to Germany by the Emperor\r\nAlexander during the last war, all has concurred to render this alliance\r\nstill more firm.\"\r\n\r\nBy a sort of historical fiction which confounds the reason not a little,\r\nbut which a sovereign will imposes on acts and even public monuments in\r\nRussia, the campaign of 1870 did not cease to be exalted in the official\r\nspheres of the empire of the czars as the continuation of the work of\r\n1814, as the final episode of \"that great epoch when the united armies\r\nof Russia and Prussia fought for a sacred cause which was common to them\r\nboth.\"[140] At the Kremlin, in the splendid hall consecrated by the\r\nEmperor Nicholas to the military glories of the country, and which is\r\nthe _arc de l'Etoile_ of Holy Russia, the foreign tourist is astonished\r\nto see glittering now in letters of gold on the marble the names of\r\nMoltke, of Roon, and other captains of Germany who shone in the last war\r\nagainst France.[141] And the conqueror of Sedan might imagine that he\r\nwas still in the midst of his subjects in traversing in 1873 the vast\r\nMuscovite plains: from the frontier to the Gulf of Finland the journey\r\nwas an uninterrupted succession of triumphs and ovations. At each depot\r\nwhere the imperial train stopped a guard of honor was in waiting, and\r\nplayed the German national song; the czar came to meet his august guest\r\nto Gatchina, and the 27th April the two sovereigns entered the capital\r\nof Peter the Great. The skies were gloomy and cold, and the sun refused\r\nto lighten \"the city of wet streets and dry hearts,\" as one of its poets\r\nhas called it; but human industry did all that was possible to supply\r\nthe place of nature, and make amends for the irreparable outrage of the\r\nclimate. \"All the green-houses of the capital, without excepting those\r\nof the imperial gardens,\" says an eye-witness,[142] \"were literally\r\ndevastated to improvise around the gates and windows a spring which,\r\nretarded in our North, only arrived with summer,\" and the rich carpets\r\nsuspended from the ledges or stretched along the edifices gave to the\r\nboreal city the joyous aspect of the city of lagoons. \"The perspective\r\nof Izmailovsky, the perspective of Voznessensky, the Grande-Morskaia,\r\nformed a sort of continuous alley of draperies of the Russian, German,\r\nand Prussian colors. On a great number of balconies, one saw in the\r\nmidst of the verdure and the flowers the busts of the two monarchs\r\ncrowned with laurel. The facade of the great stable Preobrajensky was\r\nornamented with a number of standards surrounding a colossal cross of\r\nthat military order of Saint George of which his majesty the Emperor\r\nWilliam is the oldest knight and the only grand ribbon.\" The crowd\r\npressed close to the passage of the guests from Berlin; the unreserved\r\nPrince de Bismarck and the taciturn Count de Moltke especially attracted\r\nthe eyes of the spectators.\r\n\r\nFor twelve days there was an endless succession of reviews, parades,\r\ntatoos, illuminations, balls, _raouts_, banquets, concerts, and gala\r\nrepresentations. Among the latter, the chroniclers mention the two\r\nsplendid ballets of the \"Roi Candaule\" and \"Don Quixotte.\" The people\r\nhad also their part in the rejoicings, especially on the evening of the\r\n29th April, at the gigantic festival of the Place du Palais. The two\r\nsovereigns were present at the immense balcony concert above the piazza\r\nof the castle. \"On their arrival, five electric suns all at once lighted\r\nthe square with such intensity that one could distinguish the features\r\nof all the spectators, and the orchestra struck up the national Prussian\r\nhymn. The total number of musicians was 1,550, in addition to 600\r\ntrumpets and 350 drums. After the hymn the \"March of King Frederick\r\nWilliam III.\" was played; then came a whole series of military marches,\r\nthe \"March of Steinmetz,\" the \"Watch on the Rhine,\" the \"March of the\r\nGarde of 1808,\" to the music of which the Russian regiments returned to\r\nSt. Petersburg after the campaign of Eylau, and the \"March of Paris,\"\r\nwhich the allied armies heard in olden times at the time of their\r\ntriumphal entry into the capital of France. The military prayer, \"God is\r\ngreat in Zion,\" also produced an immense effect.\" One can hardly explain\r\nhow, in the midst of music entirely consecrated to the gods Mars and\r\nVulcan, the sweet romance of Weber, entitled \"The Praise of Tears,\"\r\ncould be introduced, unless it was a discreet homage rendered to the\r\nwell known sensibility of the old Hohenzollern, and of which many\r\nspeeches, letters, or telegrams bear in history authentic traces. This\r\neasily impressionable character of the sovereign of Germany was visible\r\nas far as was necessary at St. Petersburg; it showed itself especially\r\nat the moment when the two monarchs made their adieux in the imperial\r\n_salons_ of the depot of Gatchina. In order not to succumb to his\r\nemotion, William I. had to leave the _salon_ brusquely; his head bent\r\nforward, his features contracted, he went out with hasty steps and\r\nreached the car _without turning round_.\r\n\r\nHowever, if during this sojourn of the Prussian guests on the banks of\r\nthe Neva all the honors were for the uncle of the czar, the curiosity of\r\nthe public, panting and almost feverish, willingly turned, one may be\r\nsure, to the extraordinary minister whose uniform of the white\r\ncurassiers set off his imposing stature--to this chancellor of Germany\r\nwho, in the short space of a lustrum, had founded an empire on the ruins\r\nof two others. One had not had time to forget at St. Petersburg the\r\ngrumbling diplomat, who from 1859 to 1862 astonished and amused the\r\nRussian society by his slanders against his own court, by his\r\npleasantries on the \"old fogies of Potsdam\" and the \"Philistines of the\r\nSpree,\" and who occasionally repeated the famous _mot_ of M.\r\nPrudhomme--the _mot_: \"_If I were the government!_\"--he who was to laugh\r\nat it the first. He was the government at this time, he was even the\r\nmaster of Europe; and his star had dimmed the star of a Hapsburg, of a\r\nNapoleon! The subject gave rise to more than one touching\r\nreconciliation, to many a _piquant_ reminiscence, and there was room\r\nalso for futile remarks for the _plerisque vana mirantibus_ of which the\r\nimmortal historian speaks in presence of any prodigious change of\r\nfortune. In presence of the man of the five milliards, the great ladies\r\nat the winter palace remembered a certain ambassadress ten years before,\r\nwho one day boldly declared that she could not pay forty silver roubles\r\nfor early asparagus, who another day avowed in all candor that she owed\r\nher new diamond ear-rings only to the exchange of a valuable snuff-box,\r\nan old gift of the Prince of Darmstadt.[143] The ambassadress was the\r\nwife of Prince de Bismarck, then baron, prince to-day, a good prince\r\ntoo, and having lost nothing of his former affability. He was easy,\r\nplayful, earnest, as at the time of his mission in Russia; he inquired\r\nfor friends, acquaintances, small or great people whom he had known\r\nformerly, and seemed to renew relations and conversations as if\r\ninterrupted only yesterday. The statesman disappeared entirely, to show\r\nonly the courtier and the man of the world, and it was only in his\r\nrelations with Prince Gortchakof, a sagacious observer tells us, that\r\nhe laid aside the foreign minister, and only appeared as the companion,\r\nalmost as the compatriot. He showed him the deference of an affectionate\r\nfriend towards his elder,--of a disciple towards the master, said the\r\nflatterers, without thinking of evil, without thinking, above all, on\r\nthe _discipulus supra magistrum_ of whom Alexander Mikhailovitch, a good\r\nLatinist himself, perhaps thought.\r\n\r\nThey often appeared thus in public, at numerous _fetes_ and receptions,\r\nside by side, the one towering above the crowd with his strongly-marked\r\nhead, the other also easily recognizable by his fine, _spirituel_, and\r\nrather sharp features. According to that ingenious court etiquette of\r\nwhich the good Homer has given the first precept, in making Diomede and\r\nGlaucus exchange their brilliant armor, the Russian minister wore the\r\ninsignia of the black Eagle of Prussia, and the Prussian minister the\r\ninsignia of St. Andrew of Russia,--and this exchange of ribbons\r\ninvoluntarily recalled the commonalty of ties which had for so long\r\nunited these illustrious diplomats. Such a cordial, unalterable\r\nunderstanding between two statesmen directing two different empires, was\r\nassuredly a rare phenomenon, well calculated to excite attention, and\r\nwhich, during the pompous solemnities of St. Petersburg, did not cease,\r\nin fact, to occupy reflective minds. They sought in vain in the past for\r\nthe example of a harmony of action as constant and glowing: certain\r\npolitical friendships celebrated in history, those among others of\r\nChoiseul and Kaunitz, of Dubois and Stanhope, or yet of Mazarin and\r\nCromwell, were only evoked an instant to be immediately recognized as\r\ndeceptive souvenirs, apparent analogies only. No one, however,\r\ndisregarded the considerable, decisive influence which the accord\r\nbetween the two chancellors has had on the recent destinies of Europe;\r\nnor did any one doubt the prodigious benefit which M. de Bismarck has\r\nbeen able to draw from this juncture in his bold enterprises: the\r\nopinions began to differ only when there was a question of settling the\r\naccounts of Russia, of fixing well the profits brought to the empire of\r\nthe czars by this association of ten years, the most turbulent ten years\r\nwhich the Continent has known since the day of Waterloo.\r\n\r\nAccording to the ideas of some, there was only advantage and gain for\r\nthe people of Rourik, in the situation created by the immense events of\r\nSadowa and Sedan. They showed the humiliating treaty of 1856 torn up,\r\nAustria punished for its \"treason\" at the time of the Crimean war,\r\nFrance sunken and weakened, England a resigned spectator of the progress\r\nof General Kaufman at Bokhara, and Russia recovering its ancient\r\nprestige, tasting in all quiet the vengeance, that pleasure of the gods\r\nand of the great favorites of the gods like Alexander Mikhailovitch. Is\r\nthere not in truth, was said, a marvelous fortune, an imposing unity in\r\nthe career of this minister who, at the conference of Vienna, had sworn\r\nto take revenge for the abasement of his country, and who has so well\r\nkept his word? Is there not a grand Nemesis in the successive\r\nchastisement of these proud \"allies\" who, in 1853, had undertaken the\r\ndefense of the crescent against the cross of St. Andrew, who, ten years\r\nlater, had dared to raise the question of Poland? At the present time\r\nAustria and France are rivals in flattering, obsequious conduct before\r\nthe so decried \"barbarian of the North,\" England solicits of him a\r\n_modus vivendi_ in central Asia; and this enviable and glorious position\r\nRussia has obtained without conflict, without sacrifices, only by\r\n_meditating_, developing its interior prosperity, and letting its\r\nneighbor act alone, its secular, tried friend, whose devotion has never\r\nbeen doubted. It is only just that Prussia should reap the fruits of its\r\nvalor and its fidelity, and the well known sentiments of the Emperor\r\nWilliam towards the czar, the family ties which have so long united the\r\ntwo courts; lastly, the destinies, so distinct and yet so connected, of\r\nthe two states, are certain gages of a future, permanent, and immovable\r\nunderstanding. How many times has Prussia solemnly declared that it has\r\nno interest in the Oriental question. The day when the question of the\r\nsuccession of the Osmanli arises, the Hohenzollern will prove his\r\ngratitude to the Romanof. The little jealousies and the little rivalries\r\nhave had their day, like the little states and the little artifices of\r\ninfluence and of the balance of power: the future is for a rational\r\npolicy based on the nature of things, the reality of geography, the\r\nhomogeneity of races; and this policy assigns to Russia and Germany\r\ntheir respective _roles_ and corollaries. In point of view of general\r\nprinciples, we can only rejoice that the sceptre of the Occident has\r\nescaped a turbulent, volcanic nation now making Jacobin, now\r\nultramontane propaganda, but always revolutionary, to pass into the\r\nhands of a well-ordered, hierarchical, and disciplined state, as it is.\r\nLastly, Sadowa and Sedan were Protestant victories over the first two\r\nCatholic Powers, and the contest in which M. de Bismarck engaged against\r\nthe Roman Curia is only the logical consequence of this great fact of\r\nhistory; but without even sharing certain ideas, widely spread however,\r\nof a possible fusion of the Protestant and Orthodox beliefs, it is not\r\nfor the church of Photius, in any case, to take umbrage at the mortal\r\nblow given to the Vatican.\r\n\r\nTo such justifications, in which neither convincing arguments nor sharp\r\ntouches were wanting, those dissenting opposed objections inspired by a\r\npatriotism equally sincere, but much less hopeful. Also admiring the\r\nfacility and promptitude with which Russia has arisen from its great\r\ndisaster of the Crimea, they pretended only that this great result had\r\nbeen obtained long before the advent of M. de Bismarck, long before any\r\nassociation with him, and that from the year 1860 the empire of the\r\nRourik had retaken the great position which it deserved in Europe, when\r\nthe sovereigns of Austria, Prussia, and so many of the princes of\r\nGermany had come to salute the czar at Warsaw, to recognize his moral\r\nsupremity, and that Napoleon III. on his part sought his friendship and\r\naccepted his arbitration. The great ability with which Prince Gortchakof\r\nused the \"French cordiality\" for the good of Russia, without giving up\r\nany essential interests, and without compromising the conservative and\r\ntraditional principles of his government, always remained one of his\r\ngreatest claims to the gratitude of his country, and it would have been\r\ndesirable had he preserved the same moderation, the same reserve, later\r\nin this intimacy with Prussia, which on the occasion of the Polish\r\ninsurrection had replaced the former understanding with the Tuileries.\r\nThe successor of Nesselrode exaggerated, without doubt, the bearing and\r\nthe danger of the famous _remonstrances_ on the subject of Poland, as\r\nwell as the nature of the services, very selfish as a whole, which his\r\nfriend of Berlin then rendered him; in any case, that was certainly not\r\na reason to pout at Europe after the affair had turned out to the\r\nstriking advantage of the Russian government, to pout at it during long\r\nyears, to wish no other ally than Prussia, and to persist, in respect to\r\nthis last Power, in the constant policy of let-go, let-do, and let-take.\r\n\r\nThis was in general the profound misfortune of the fifteen or twenty\r\nlast years,--thought these enlightened patriots,--that rancor and bad\r\nhumor had played such a great _role_ in the grave affairs of the world:\r\nsad sentiments surely, and from which the present chancellor of Germany\r\nhas alone been able to preserve himself! It was through anger at the\r\nconduct of the cabinet of St. Petersburg in the Italian question, that\r\nAustria took under its protection the insurgents of Poland; it was\r\nthrough bad humor towards England in the question of the congress that\r\nNapoleon III. abandoned the cause of Denmark, and Alexander\r\nMikhailovitch yielded to such motives more than to any others; he was\r\nthe first to practice this \"policy of spite\" with his imaginary\r\ngrievances against Austria in the war of the Orient, as he was also not\r\nthe last to cherish a certain \"_policy de pour-boire_\" with his _league\r\nof the neutrals_ which hindered any concerted action of the Powers.\r\nWhat happy opportunities for the preservation of Europe, for the glory\r\nof his nation and the splendor of his august master, has not the Russian\r\nchancellor let pass through love for Prussia: in the spring of 1867,\r\nwhen France and Austria offered him such large concessions in the\r\nOrient; in the autumn of 1870, when England and Austria solicited him to\r\ntake the initiative in the work of peace! What illusions also in that\r\nbelief, that Prince Gortchakof has sacrificed nothing during those ten\r\nyears of association with his formidable colleague! Was the port of\r\nKiel, the key of the Baltic, delivered into the hands of the Germans,\r\nnothing? Was that nothing, the dismemberment of the Danish monarchy, the\r\ncountry of the future empress? Was the vassalage of Queen Olga nothing?\r\nThe overturning and spoliation of so many reigning families allied by\r\nblood to the House of Romanof, the loss of the independence of these\r\nsecondary States always so devoted and so faithful to Russia? Lastly,\r\nwas this profound overturning of the ancient European equilibrium, and\r\nthe unmeasured, gigantic aggrandizement of a neighboring Power, nothing?\r\n\r\n\"Greatness is a relative thing, and a country can be diminished, while\r\nremaining the same, when new forces accumulate around it.\"[144] These\r\nwords, which Napoleon III. heard on the day after Sadowa, Russia could\r\nwell apply to itself, since the day of Sedan, for assuredly no one would\r\nwish to pretend that the abolition of Article III. of the treaty of\r\nParis is the equivalent of the forces accumulated by Prussia in the\r\ncentre of Europe. As to the _hopes_ in the Orient, they are very\r\ncontingent, like every speculation of heritage: the _sick man_ has\r\nalready so many times deceived the expectations of his doctors, one can\r\nno longer count the mortal crises which should have carried him off, and\r\nperhaps it is not Russia that should complain of this prolongation of\r\nthe agony. It is still a question in truth if Russia is now in a\r\nposition to take care of the succession, if it is sufficiently supplied\r\nwith implements for such a vast establishment; if, in a word, it has all\r\nits military and financial strength, as well as all the administrative\r\n_personnel_ indispensable to advantageously occupy the domains as\r\nvarious as extended. It cannot take possession of European provinces\r\nlike the countries along the Amour and Syr-Daria; it runs the risk of\r\nfinding more than one ungovernable Poland among those peoples of the\r\nDanube and the Balkan; and the unity of the law, the uniformity of the\r\n_svod_, will not be so easy to establish in the countries where, side by\r\nside, the most incongruous institutions have flourished from the\r\n_regime_ of the cimeter to that of the parliament. Will not the\r\ntransformation of Turkey transform, however, in turn the Muscovite\r\npeople, and will not history on this occasion be careful to repeat the\r\ngreat and pathetic lessons of _Graecia capta_? Will Russia still be\r\nRussia the day when it rules the Oriental peninsula, and can an empire\r\nbathed by the blue waves of the Bosphorus preserve its capital on the\r\nicy banks of Finland? Grave and obscure problems before which it is\r\nallowable to stop, to conceive apprehensions and doubts. What is not\r\ndoubtful, on the contrary, is that at the destined hour Prussia will\r\nmake its conditions and will stipulate its compensations. It will not be\r\na debt of gratitude which it will think of paying then, it will be a new\r\nbargain which it will make. Will it demand as the price of its consent,\r\nHolland, Jutland, or the German territories of Austria? the frontier of\r\nthe Vistula, or the provinces of the Baltic?\r\n\r\nBut who knows if this prolonged drama of Turkish decadence is not yet\r\ndestined to receive a _denoument_ little or not at all foreseen, yet\r\nvery original and nothing less than illogical. The publicists and the\r\npatriots of Berlin do not speak to-day of the mission of Austria in the\r\ncountries of the Danube and the Bosphorus, which they say is called by\r\nProvidence to strengthen in these countries German interests, to bring\r\nthere \"German culture.\" Since the great day of Sedan, especially,\r\nexhortations and summons are not wanting to this Power \"to seek its\r\ncentre of gravity elsewhere than at Vienna,\" in short, to justify its\r\nsecular name of _Ostreich_, and to become an empire of the East, in the\r\ntrue meaning of the word. A monarchy constantly menaced with the early\r\nloss of its Germanic possessions on the Leitha may at length be brought\r\nto try the experiment, when, above all, care is taken to present to it\r\nthis experiment as a necessity and as a virtue; a state which has never\r\nbeen strongly centralized, and which has always oscillated between\r\ndualism and a federal system more or less definite, will even have a\r\ngreat chance to appear to Europe as the most proper outline of this\r\nmedley of races, of religions, of institutions, which stretches from the\r\nIron Gates to the Golden Horn. An _empire of the East_ of Germanic\r\ntraditions and influences on the Bosphorus, more to the South a kingdom\r\nof Greece enlarged by Thessaly and Epirus, lastly, in the North a\r\nGermany completed in its unity by the Cisleithan provinces,--that will\r\nbe something to fully content the world, not excepting England. We must\r\nacknowledge, one solution of the formidable Ottoman question is like\r\nanother, and every hypothesis, every fantasy, has the right to appear,\r\nwhen one touches this fantastic world of the Orient, and that world not\r\nless mysterious and terrible which the great recluse of Varzin carries\r\nin his head.\r\n\r\nWhat, in any case, is not within the domain of hypothesis and fantasy,\r\nwhat unfortunately is only a too evident and palpable reality, is, that\r\nin place of this \"combination purely and exclusively defensive,\" as\r\nPrince Gortchakof one day so justly called the old _Bund_,--in place of\r\na league of peaceful states, all devoted friends of Russia, and forming\r\nfor it a continual succession of ramparts,--the empire of Alexander II.\r\nnow sees before it, firmly settled all along its frontier, a formidable\r\nPower, the strongest Power of the Continent, ambitious, avaricious,\r\nenterprising, and having henceforward the undoubted mission of defending\r\nagainst it what they have agreed to call the _interests of the\r\nOccident_. This Power can always excite the Polish question, if it\r\nwishes to, according to its wants, and quite differently than the\r\ncabinets of Paris and London would do it: has not the argument for such\r\na \"_coup au coeur_\" been very warmly sustained in 1871, by certain\r\nHungarian statesmen in the confidence of the Prussian minister? The\r\nconduct of the government of Berlin at the time of the last insurrection\r\nof Warsaw did not injure it in the future: the passionate speeches of M.\r\nde Bismarck in 1849 against the revolt of the Magyars did not prevent\r\nhim from arming, many years later, the legions of General Klapka. We\r\ncannot at least deny the Prussian plans in 1863 on the left bank of the\r\nVistula, \"the natural frontier;\" now, do not the friends of Berlin\r\noccasionally insinuate that this would be the most efficacious means to\r\nend the spirit of Polonism? They do not speak of the provinces of the\r\nBaltic, as before Sadowa they repudiated all thoughts of ever wishing to\r\nfree the Main; but the Teutonic effervescence from Courland and Livonia\r\ngoes on increasing, and to what grievous sacrifices will the\r\nHohenzollern not resign himself when he thinks that he hears a voice\r\nfrom above, the voice of \"German brothers?\"\r\n\r\nCertainly it would have made the prince regent tremble in 1858, if any\r\none had spoken to him then of a war against a Hapsburg, and of a\r\ncompanion in arms named Garibaldi; he ended, however, by accepting the\r\nhard necessity, and he gave the signal for a fratricidal combat, with\r\ngrief in his soul and tears in his eyes. Is it not puerile, however, to\r\nmeasure the destinies of nations by the life, more or less long, of this\r\nor that sovereign? An emperor can reign in Germany who has neither\r\naffection for, nor the remembrance of Alexander II.; he can raise up \"a\r\nPharaoh who knows not Joseph,\" to speak with Holy Writ, and then there\r\nis something stronger in the world than czar and emperor: the necessity\r\nof history, the fatality of race. A formidable race that of these\r\nconquerors of Sadowa and Sedan, whose invading and conquering minds have\r\nfrom the beginning survived all transformations and accommodated\r\nthemselves to all disguises! Humble, and at the same time presumptuous,\r\ntemperate and prolific, expansive and tenacious, practicing with\r\npersistence their old proverb, _ubi bene, ibi patria_, and nevertheless\r\nalways preserving a rough attachment for the _mother country_, the\r\nGermans infiltrate every country, penetrate all regions, disdain no\r\ncorner of the habitable world. They have their friends and relations on\r\nall the thrones and in all the offices of the world; they people the\r\nindustrial centres of Europe and the solitudes of the far West; they\r\ndecide the presidential elections in the United States; they furnish the\r\nlargest contingent of the high administrative _personnel_ in the empire\r\nof the czars, and the remembrance is still recent of that statistic of\r\nthe Russian army, which, in 100 superior officers, counts eighty of\r\nGerman origin.[145] So Germany appeared before the great strokes of\r\nfortune of 1866 and of 1870, before the era of _iron and blood_, before\r\nM. de Bismarck had awakened in it the secret of its strength, had said\r\nto it the magic word, _tu regere imperio populos_! Is it necessary to\r\nrecall now the hatred which the Germans have always borne against the\r\nSclavic name, the extermination which they lately vowed on the Elbe\r\nand the Oder; and does not the mind recoil in terror before a new\r\nconflict of the two races, to-day more probable than ever? It is\r\nallowable to treat all these apprehensions as boyish dreams, hollow\r\nthoughts of _literati_ and professors; but the eminent men, the serious\r\nmen, the _augures_ and _aruspices_ of politics, have they in our day\r\ntreated otherwise many a formidable problem? Have they not used the same\r\nlanguage on the question of Schleswig-Holstein and the German\r\npretensions to Alsace, in regard to the unity of Italy and the plans of\r\nthe _National Verein_? That would be a curious chapter of\r\ncontemporaneous history to write, that of the _Diplomats and\r\nProfessors_, and which could well show that of these two respectable\r\nbodies the most pedantic and the most ideological is not exactly the one\r\nwhich a vain people thinks.\r\n\r\nIs there not,--the same persons continue, more careful of the interests\r\nof the present and the future than of the unseasonable reminiscences of\r\nthe past,--is there not ideological force, for instance, in the manner\r\nof assimilating the two epochs of 1814 and 1870, and of saluting in\r\nField Marshal Moltke the continuator of the work of Koutouzof? At the\r\ntime of the memorable war of which the burning of Moscow had given the\r\nheroic signal, it was all Europe that arose against an insolent master\r\nand bore deliverance to states trodden and ground down by a universal\r\ndominion. Was it the same in the last conflagration? and can one not\r\nrather say that it was France, on the contrary, that fought at this\r\nmoment for the equilibrium of the world and the independence of\r\nkingdoms, trying to repair by a tardy and badly conceived effort a\r\nseries of culpable errors, but from which it was not the only one to\r\nsuffer? Different in their motives, the two epochs scarcely resemble\r\neach other more as to ways and means. It was \"a war by means of\r\nrevolutions\" that the Prussian minister had early announced to M.\r\nBenedetti, and he has kept his word; he had regards, attenuations,\r\n_comprehensions_ for the _commune_ difficult to justify; now he openly\r\nprotects the Republican _regime_ in France against any attempt at\r\nrestoration, thus sacrificing the monarchical principle and the highest\r\nconsiderations of European order to a purely selfish and vindictive\r\ncalculation. That is not the spirit which animated the allies of 1814;\r\nthe magnanimous Alexander I. especially understood differently the\r\nduties of sovereigns and the solidarity of conservative interests. And\r\nwhat a severe judgment would the Emperor Nicholas have given on every\r\n_ensemble_ of the policy of Berlin, on that regeneration of Germany\r\nwhich has not ceased to be the revolution from above, from the federal\r\nexecution in Holstein up to the arrest of the syndics of the crown; from\r\nthe destruction of the _Bund_ up to the overturning of the dynasty of\r\nthe Guelphs; from the formation of the Hungarian legions and the close\r\nrelations with Mazzini to the _Kulturkampf_ against the Catholic Church!\r\n\r\nThat we may not be deceived in fact, we can still say it is the\r\nrevolution alone which finds its profit in the war made to-day in\r\nGermany on Catholicism, and very great, very _naive_ is the illusion of\r\nthose who flatter themselves with seeing Protestant or Orthodox ideas,\r\nthe religious spirit in general, benefited by the losses of Papacy. It\r\nsuffices to cast a glance on the great battalions of the _Kulturkampf_\r\nto recognize their God; they bear on their banners very clearly the sign\r\nunder whose name they expect to conquer. Are these sincere Protestants,\r\nthese _evangelical men_ for whom the Gospel is a truth, who first rush\r\nto the assault or who only follow it with their wishes and their\r\nprayers? Assuredly not; all those who from the Reformation have not kept\r\nthe name in vain, but the strong doctrine, openly repudiate this\r\ndissension, while sighing in their souls. They have the just feeling\r\nthat in our epoch, so overturned, so profoundly disturbed by the genius\r\nof negation, religious interests are conjointly responsible between them\r\njust as well as conservative interests. Those eager for the combat, the\r\nzealots \"filled with the divine spirit,\" are precisely those who admit\r\nneither divinity nor spirit, who have no other positive religion than\r\npositivism; and it is not in them surely that Luther resuscitated would\r\nwish to recognize his children. The great adversary of Rome in the\r\nsixteenth century held on to the revelation, he held on to his Bible, to\r\nhis dogma of pardon: are not all these things very \"old-fashioned,\" and\r\nvery laughable in the eyes of the disciples of Strauss and Darwin? The\r\napostle of Wittemberg believed in justification through faith; the\r\napostles of Berlin believe in justification through success.\r\n\r\nIt is a grave matter,--at length conclude these men, alarmed in their\r\npatriotism and in their conservative sentiments,--an extremely perilous\r\nmatter for a great state to abandon, in its relations with the Powers,\r\ncertain established maxims, certain rules of conduct tried by long\r\nexperience, become in a manner the _arcana imperii_, and Napoleon III.\r\nhas just paid dearly for such a rupture with the ancient traditions in\r\nthe exterior policy of France. Russia had also, in regard to Europe,\r\nsacred traditions, which have made the greatness and the strength of the\r\npreceding reigns; under these reigns, they were jealous in defending the\r\nliberty of the Baltic, they watched over the maintenance of the\r\nequilibrium of strength between Austria and Prussia, they appreciated\r\nthe friendship and the devotion of the secondary States of Germany, and\r\nthey caused the monarchical principle to be everywhere respected as\r\nopposed to revolution. Then Russia never had to repent at having turned\r\naside from the ways hollowed out by the triumphal car of Peter the\r\nGreat, of Catherine II., of Alexander I., and of Nicholas!\r\n\r\nThus spoke the independent minds on the banks of the Neva while the\r\nofficial world there displayed all the northern magnificence in honor of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror: however, they only lent a reasoning and touching\r\nlanguage to a vague, but intense and profound sentiment which agitated\r\nthe very soul of Russia. With that habit of obedience and discipline\r\nthat one can often accuse of a servile instinct, but which with this\r\npeople is also sometimes a great and admirable patriotic instinct, the\r\nchildren of Rourik were careful not to cross the government in the\r\nbrilliant reception which it gave the Prussian; they limited themselves\r\nto remaining impassible witnesses of a spectacle which did not appeal to\r\ntheir inmost feelings. The press showed itself abstemious of\r\ndescriptions, more sparing still in reflections during these days of\r\n_fetes_ and festivals; the officials of Berlin only praised them with\r\nhaving maintained a _decorous_ tone. Such was also the tone of Russian\r\nsociety taken as a whole; the beautiful _perspectives_ of the imperial\r\nresidence appealed to the moral as well as to the physical man; flowers\r\nfrom hot-houses on the first floor, ice under foot! The guests were not\r\nthe last to see the contrast: with the exquisite perfumes of exotic\r\nplants, they breathed from time to time the sharp air of the country,\r\nthe rough North wind, and it was not M. de Bismarck himself who did not\r\nseem to feel the circumambient atmosphere. One found in him more\r\nvivacity and enjoyment than of dash and warmth; his words preserved a\r\nmeasuredness which was not usual with him, and seemed to designedly\r\navoid all _eclat_ and all light. A curious matter, during this sojourn\r\nof two weeks in the capital of Russia, the former grumbling diplomat did\r\nnot let any of his sallies and jokes escape, of which he is generally so\r\nprodigal,--none of those amazing indiscretions which are at once the\r\namusement and the horror of the _salons_ and the chancellors' offices.\r\nThey only gleaned a single sensational expression fallen from those lips\r\nwhich have so often pronounced the decree of destiny, the expression\r\n\"that he could not even admit the thought of being hostile to Russia.\"\r\nThe declaration seemed explicit and reassuring, and like a discreet\r\nreply to an apprehension which did not dare to show itself openly. The\r\nincredulous or fretful souls could not, however, desist from observing\r\nthat only ten years before such an assurance given to the empire of the\r\nczars by a minister of Prussia, would have seemed very superfluous,\r\nwould have even provoked smiles.\r\n\r\nHere ends the task which was imposed on us in undertaking this study.\r\nThe meeting of the two chancellors in the capital of Peter the Great, in\r\nthe spring of 1873, was like the epilogue of a common action which has\r\nlasted ten years, and which has contributed so much to change the face\r\nof the world. Since this epoch, Europe has known no tempest, although\r\noccasionally menacing and threatening clouds have not ceased to traverse\r\nits still obscured horizon. There were even glimmerings and indications\r\nthat the old and fatal agreement between the cabinets of Berlin and St.\r\nPetersburg was no longer as absolute as in the past, that it admitted\r\ncertain intermissions, or at least certain differences of opinions and\r\nappreciations. It is thus that the government of the czar refused to\r\nfollow the chancellor of Germany in his Spanish campaign, in his\r\nfeverish adhesion to the presidency of Marshal Serrano, and it did not\r\nseem doubtful that the personal intervention of Alexander II., strongly\r\nsupported by England in the past year, turned from France an iniquitous\r\naggression and a terrible calamity. Since that epoch, also, the adhesion\r\nof Austria to the official policy of the two Northern states has\r\ncome--we cannot emphasize it too much--either to complete or to\r\ncomplicate an association in which it becomes difficult to discover any\r\ncommon interests, and which, up to this day at least, has only found\r\nharmony in silence. The future alone can unveil the importance and the\r\nvirtue of this extolled alliance of three empires, as badly known as it\r\nis badly conceived, perhaps; but one will scarcely be deceived in\r\nsupposing that to-day, in this double and troubled household, it is M.\r\nde Bismarck who can think himself the happiest of the three.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[139] _Provincial Correspondence_ of the 1st May, 1873.\r\n\r\n[140] Telegram from the czar to King William I. of the 9th December,\r\n1869.

BENEDETTI TO THE EDITOR OF THE \"REVUE DES DEUX\r\n     MONDES.\" REPLY OF M. KLACZKO.\r\n\r\n                              PARIS, _24th September_, 1875.\r\n\r\n     TO THE EDITOR,--You published in the last number of the\r\n     \"Revue des deux Mondes,\" an article by M. Klaczko, which\r\n     forces me to ask you for an opportunity for a short\r\n     explanation. I surely would not wish to contest with any one\r\n     the right of estimating the events of which this author has\r\n     undertaken the anecdotal history, and of judging, as best one\r\n     can, of the part which I took in them; I call, on the\r\n     contrary, with all my heart, in my own interest as well as in\r\n     that of the government which I have had the honor to serve,\r\n     for the examination and the discussion; for it, as for me, I\r\n     can only be satisfied with the light which already flashes\r\n     from it, and with the errors which have been dissipated; but\r\n     the discussion is serious and useful only if it is loyal, and\r\n     it is loyal only when recounting fixed and undeniable facts.\r\n\r\n     Now, here is what I read in the article of M. Klaczko:\r\n     \"Certainly the ambassador of France at the court of Berlin\r\n     had, in this year 1866 a very difficult and painful position,\r\n     we had almost said a pathetic one. He had worked with\r\n     _ardor_, with _passion_, to bring about this _connubio_ of\r\n     Italy and Prussia, which seemed to him to be an immense good\r\n     fortune for the imperial policy, a brilliant victory gained\r\n     over the old order of things to the profit of the 'new right'\r\n     and Napoleonic ideas. In the fear, very well founded besides,\r\n     of seeing this work miscarry and Prussia draw back, if one\r\n     spoke to it of eventual compensations and preventive\r\n     engagements, he had not _ceased to dissuade_ his government\r\n     from any attempt of this kind.\" Pp. 210, 211. Already, at p.\r\n     206, in a note, M. Klaczko had said: \"M. Drouyn de Lhuys, who\r\n     had already obtained from Austria the cession, in any case,\r\n     of Venetia, insisted at this moment more strongly than ever,\r\n     that they should also take pledges in advance from Prussia,\r\n     'the most formidable, the most active of the parties.' M.\r\n     Benedetti _did not cease to oppose_ such a proceeding,\r\n     fearing that Prussia would renounce in this case all idea of\r\n     war against Austria.\"\r\n\r\n     Now, these allegations have no meaning, or they signify that\r\n     I was the real inspirer, if not the negotiator, without the\r\n     knowledge of my government, of the treaty of alliance\r\n     concluded in 1866 between Prussia and Italy; that I,\r\n     moreover, turned, by incessant efforts, M. Drouyn de Lhuys\r\n     from his intention of demanding of the Berlin government,\r\n     before the war against Austria, the pledges eventually\r\n     necessary for the security of France.\r\n\r\n     M. Klaczko neither corroborates these assertions by any known\r\n     fact, nor by the extract from an official document; he gives\r\n     no proof of them in any degree or in any way.\r\n\r\n     As to what concerns the Prusso-Italian treaty, he was\r\n     informed, however, since he continually quotes the\r\n     publication which I made in 1871, under the title, \"My\r\n     Mission in Prussia,\" that I repudiated any participation in\r\n     this act; he knew that I had claimed to have shown it, and it\r\n     is not sufficient to contradict me; in such a case it is\r\n     necessary to prove the contrary, to establish that, far from\r\n     having remained ignorant, as I maintained, of the accord\r\n     between Prussia and Italy, I had been the principal\r\n     instigator of it.\r\n\r\n     It is of importance to me that the readers of the \"Revue des\r\n     deux Mondes\" be enlightened; they have seen the article of M.\r\n     Klaczko, it is just to place under their eyes some words only\r\n     from the dispatches which I published.... I wrote on the 14th\r\n     March, 1866: \"The early arrival of an Italian officer,\r\n     General Govone, is announced, who comes to Berlin charged\r\n     with an important mission; this news ... has caused\r\n     considerable emotion. If it is confirmed, one will not fail\r\n     to believe that Prussia and Italy are negotiating a treaty of\r\n     alliance.\"\r\n\r\n     The third day after, I added: \"General Govone arrived day\r\n     before yesterday at Berlin. According to Count Bismarck and\r\n     the Italian minister, he is charged with a military mission,\r\n     and his journey will have simply for its object the study of\r\n     the perfection arrived at in the instruments of war.\"\r\n\r\n     Two days later, I was in a position to inform my government\r\n     exactly, and I said: \"I wrote you, announcing the arrival of\r\n     General Govone, that, according to M. de Bismarck and the\r\n     Italian minister, this envoy of the cabinet of Florence was\r\n     simply charged with studying the military condition of\r\n     Prussia. Forgetting, without doubt, what he had told me on\r\n     this point, M. de Bismarck informed me yesterday that General\r\n     Govone was authorized to conclude arrangements with the\r\n     Prussian government. The communications which he has made to\r\n     the president of the council substantiate this.\" In closing\r\n     this dispatch, I added: \"The legation of Italy observes\r\n     toward me absolute reserve. I do not know whether to regret\r\n     it. The confidences of M. de Bismarck, which I cannot,\r\n     however, decline, already place me in a sufficiently delicate\r\n     position.\"\r\n\r\n     At last, on the 27th March, when the plenipotentiaries had\r\n     already held several conferences, I wrote to M. Drouyn de\r\n     Lhuys: \"(M. de Bismarck) has spoken to me of his conferences\r\n     with General Govone and the Italian minister, ... and I am so\r\n     much the better in a position to inform you that M. de\r\n     Barral, Italian minister, _has_ AT LAST _decided on his part\r\n     not to hide from me entirely his proceedings and the\r\n     intentions of his government_.\"\r\n\r\n     One of two things, either M. Klaczko admits that my\r\n     correspondence was sincere, or he supposes that it was drawn\r\n     up with the design of dissimulating my conduct and the part\r\n     which I clandestinely took in the negotiation. In the first\r\n     case, no one will conceive how he can pretend that I labored\r\n     _with ardor and with passion to bring about this connubio of\r\n     Italy and Prussia_. In the second hypothesis matters are\r\n     changed, and I shall expect that M. Klaczko will be explained\r\n     as far as he goes by the expression of my opinion.\r\n\r\n     For the moment, I will invoke the only testimony that no one\r\n     can suspect, that of the Italian plenipotentiary. The\r\n     correspondence of General Govone was published after his\r\n     death and subsequently to \"My Mission in Prussia,\" through\r\n     the efforts of General La Marmora, who has omitted nothing.\r\n     In this correspondence, where all is told in detail, my name\r\n     is quoted twice, the first time in a telegram of the 28th\r\n     March, twelve days after the arrival of the Italian\r\n     plenipotentiary at Berlin, and here is what he says as\r\n     regards me: \"I think that I ought to announce to you that the\r\n     president (M. de Bismarck) keeps M. Benedetti exactly\r\n     advised.\"\r\n\r\n     In the letter in which my name appears for the second and\r\n     last time, dated the 6th April, on the very eve of the\r\n     signing of the treaty (the dates are valuable, and it is well\r\n     to retain them), General Govone mentions a visit which he\r\n     paid me, the first since his arrival at Berlin; and what did\r\n     I say to him concerning these negotiations? I quote\r\n     literally: \"Yesterday, after my visit to M. de Bismarck, I\r\n     saw M. Benedetti; he thought that it was preferable for us to\r\n     sign no treaty, but only to have a project all discussed and\r\n     ready to sign when the mobilization of Prussia should be\r\n     achieved.\"\r\n\r\n     Do these two extracts, Mr. Editor, authorize the belief that\r\n     I was the confidant and the counselor of the Italian envoy?\r\n     Do they not confirm, on the contrary, from point to point the\r\n     sincerity of my correspondence? In what has M. Klaczko\r\n     sought, where has he seen that I labored for the accord\r\n     between Italy and Prussia? Should he not have told us before\r\n     making such a grave assertion? Does he think to reproach me\r\n     for having endeavored to keep myself informed as to what was\r\n     passing, and for having instructed my government exactly?\r\n\r\n     As to the assertion of M. Klaczko, twice repeated in his\r\n     article, that I did not cease, before the war, to dissuade M.\r\n     Drouyn de Lhuys from speaking at Berlin of eventual\r\n     compensations and preventive engagements, from fear of seeing\r\n     Prussia give up the combat with Austria, I will reply by the\r\n     following extract from a letter which M. Drouyn de Lhuys\r\n     himself addressed to me on the 31st March, during the\r\n     negotiation opened between the two cabinets of Berlin and\r\n     Florence: \"I have read with pleasure,\" said he to me, \"the\r\n     private letters which you have written to me during the\r\n     present month. I beg leave to express to you all my thanks\r\n     for them. If I have received them without replying\r\n     immediately, it was because I had nothing to modify _in the\r\n     instructions_ which I have given you on different occasions.\r\n     We are still of the same opinions. While recognizing the\r\n     gravity of the new crisis in which we participate, we see, in\r\n     the contention which presents itself to-day, no sufficient\r\n     motive for us to depart from our attitude of neutrality. We\r\n     have explained ourselves frankly to the court of Prussia.\r\n     When we have been asked by the cabinet of Vienna, we have\r\n     firmly declared to it, that we wish to remain neutral,\r\n     although it has observed to us that our neutrality was more\r\n     favorable to Prussia than to Austria. _We await, then, the\r\n     armed conflict_, if it must break out, in the attitude in\r\n     which we really are. The king himself has acknowledged that\r\n     the present circumstances do not offer the bases of accord\r\n     that his majesty desires. The course of events, the nature\r\n     and the bearing of the interests which are involved, and the\r\n     dimensions which the war will take, as well as the questions\r\n     which it will give rise to, will _then_ determine the\r\n     elements of the understanding which can exist between Prussia\r\n     and us.\"\r\n\r\n     In this same letter, the whole of which can be read on page\r\n     77 of \"My Mission in Prussia,\" M. Drouyn de Lhuys wished\r\n     moreover to indicate to me the consideration which obliged us\r\n     to observe a reserved attitude in view of the efforts made by\r\n     Prussia, and by Italy, to act in concert, and he added at the\r\n     close: \"That is the whole truth concerning our opinions. I\r\n     approve, however, completely of your attitude and your\r\n     language, and I trust that you will continue to keep me\r\n     equally well informed of all the details of this crisis.\"\r\n\r\n     Would M. Drouyn de Lhuys have acknowledged the receipt of my\r\n     correspondence in these terms, if it was intended to deter\r\n     him from any plan of contracting eventual engagements with\r\n     Prussia, if there had existed between the minister and the\r\n     ambassador the disagreement the whole responsibility of which\r\n     M. Klaczko wishes to throw on me? I dwell no longer on this\r\n     subject, leaving to the penetration of your readers the task\r\n     of seeing things more clearly; I only wish you to remark\r\n     that, if M. Klaczko, as I suppose, has seen that letter\r\n     before writing his article, it becomes impossible to explain\r\n     the errors of it.\r\n\r\n     I regret to say, however, that I should have to criticise\r\n     almost all his work, if I wished to correct the defective\r\n     parts of it; but I do not intend to abuse my right of reply,\r\n     and I will go no farther. I will rectify, however, another\r\n     error on account of its particular importance. Replying to a\r\n     telegraphic question of M. Drouyn de Lhuys, I wrote him on\r\n     the 8th June, 1866, that no one in Prussia, from the king to\r\n     the most humble of his subjects, with the exception of M. de\r\n     Bismarck, would consent, in my opinion, to abandon to us any\r\n     part of the German territory on the Rhine. After having\r\n     quoted an extract from my dispatch, M. Klaczko adds: \"And\r\n     this is the same diplomat who had so well appreciated the\r\n     situation before the campaign of Bohemia, it is the same\r\n     ambassador _who now undertakes_ to present to M. de Bismarck\r\n     the demands of the cabinet of the Tuileries, who went so far\r\n     as to submit to him, on the 5th August, a plan of a secret\r\n     treaty implying the abandonment to France of the whole left\r\n     bank of the Rhine, without excepting the great fortress of\r\n     Mayence!\"\r\n\r\n     M. Klaczko mistakes. I did not take upon myself to make this\r\n     communication, and his allegation, deprived, moreover, of all\r\n     proof, astonishes me the more as he could have seen in \"My\r\n     Mission in Prussia,\" that affairs were not conducted in that\r\n     manner; that, on the contrary, while pointing out the serious\r\n     and new difficulties which seemed to oppose this project, I\r\n     demanded time to previously go to Paris to confer with the\r\n     government, and that I was _ordered_ to proceed. Did I do\r\n     well or badly in obeying? That is another question; but M.\r\n     Klaczko should all the more abstain from presenting this\r\n     incident in such a manner as to emphasize the consequences of\r\n     it, which have been grave and gloomy, as he is careful to\r\n     remember.\r\n\r\n     If it is thus that M. Klaczko understands the duties of the\r\n     historian, I can only express my surprise at it. He,\r\n     doubtless, did not perceive that party spirit and personal\r\n     sympathies have suggestions which loyalty disavows. I regret\r\n     it for a publicist who had accustomed the readers of the\r\n     \"Revue des deux Mondes\" to better prepared and more\r\n     impartially written studies. As far as I am concerned, you\r\n     will understand, Mr. Editor, that I could not sanction by my\r\n     silence assertions so destitute of foundation, and that M.\r\n     Klaczko has forced me to protest in spite of my very sincere\r\n     desire to avoid any polemics, and to maintain a reserve from\r\n     which it is painful for me to depart. This letter, however,\r\n     has no other object, and while asking you to insert it in the\r\n     next number of the \"Revue,\" I beg you to accept the assurance\r\n     of my highest regard.\r\n\r\n                                                  BENEDETTI.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. Benedetti's letter was communicated to M. Julian Klaczko, who\r\nreturned it to us with the following observations:--\r\n\r\n     M. le Comte Benedetti confounds two very different\r\n     negotiations which have been spoken of in our work, as well\r\n     as the two very distinct estimations of which they have been\r\n     the object on our part. It was only in the affair concerning\r\n     the treaty on Belgium, in the month of August, 1866, that the\r\n     conduct of M. Benedetti toward his minister seemed incorrect\r\n     to us; we have not passed the same judgment on his attitude\r\n     in the months of March and April of the same year, as regards\r\n     the secret treaty negotiated between M. de Bismarck and\r\n     General Govone; still less have we reproached him with having\r\n     been the inspirer of this treaty _without the knowledge of\r\n     his government_. We have only affirmed that his dispatches at\r\n     that time were of a nature to deter the French government\r\n     from any attempt at a prior engagement with Prussia in view\r\n     of the eventualities of the war.\r\n\r\n     M. Benedetti in truth did not cease to represent the court of\r\n     Berlin as inaccessible to any overture of this sort. Even on\r\n     the 8th June, 1866, on the eve of the war, he wrote: \"The\r\n     apprehensions which France inspires everywhere in Germany\r\n     still exist, and they will reawaken unanimously and violently\r\n     at the slightest indication which could reveal our intention\r\n     to extend ourselves toward the East.... The king, like the\r\n     most humble of his subjects, would not listen at this moment\r\n     to the possibility of a sacrifice (on the Rhine). The crown\r\n     prince, profoundly sensible of the dangers of the policy of\r\n     which he is the witness, declared, not long ago, to one of my\r\n     colleagues, with extreme vivacity, that he preferred war to\r\n     the cession of the little county of Glatz.\" (\"My Mission in\r\n     Prussia,\" pp. 171-172). In his other reports, as well as\r\n     throughout his whole book, M. Benedetti always returns to\r\n     this circumstance, that he never \"encouraged hopes\" on this\r\n     side, and that he \"sufficiently indicated that one would not\r\n     obtain in any case, with the consent of Prussia, territorial\r\n     concessions on the frontier of the East.\" (\"My Mission,\" p.\r\n     176).\r\n\r\n     That was, however, not the sentiment of the Italian\r\n     negotiators at the court of Berlin. M. de Barral, in a\r\n     telegram addressed the 6th May to General La Marmora, thus\r\n     expressed himself: \"They are busily occupied with\r\n     negotiations, we are assured, which are taking place between\r\n     France and Austria to indemnify Italy, and which will have\r\n     gone as far as the line of the Rhine to France. To the\r\n     observation which I made on the danger of such an offer by a\r\n     German Power, Bismarck replied to me by shrugging his\r\n     shoulders, indicating very clearly that, should the case\r\n     occur, he would not recoil from this means of\r\n     aggrandizement!\" On his side, General Govone, in his very\r\n     minute report of the 7th May, relates the same incident in a\r\n     fuller and much more explicit manner. \"M. de Bismarck wishes\r\n     to know the intentions and desires of the emperor; he has\r\n     spoken of them to M. de Barral; he told him to try to learn\r\n     something about them through M. Nigra; he has even given them\r\n     cause to believe that he will be disposed to abandon to him\r\n     the banks of the Rhine, having been informed by his agents\r\n     that the emperor was negotiating with Austria, and that\r\n     Austria would cede to him, so he believes, Venetia, and would\r\n     even invite him to take possession of the left bank of the\r\n     Rhine.\" M. de Barral, to whom he spoke, cried out: \"But\r\n     Austria should not thus compromise itself with Germany while\r\n     sacrificing countries which belong to the confederation!\" M.\r\n     de Bismarck made a gesture which seemed to say: \"I too would\r\n     cede them.\" Lastly, in his report of the 3d June, five days\r\n     before the dispatch of M. Benedetti concerning \"the king and\r\n     the most humble of his subjects,\" General Govone quotes the\r\n     following reply of M. de Bismarck to his demand whether one\r\n     could not find \"some geographical line\" to indemnify France?\r\n     \"There will be the Mosel (said M. de Bismarck). I am, he\r\n     added, much less German than Prussian, and I would have no\r\n     difficulty in conceding to France the cession of all the\r\n     country between the Mosel and the Rhine: the Palatinate,\r\n     Oldenburg, a part of the Prussian territory, etc. But the\r\n     king will have great scruples, and can only decide in a\r\n     supreme moment when it is a question of losing or winning\r\n     all. At any rate, to bring the mind of the king to any\r\n     arrangement with France, it will be necessary to know the\r\n     minimum (_il limite minimo_) of the pretensions of this\r\n     Power.\" (La Marmora, \"Un po piu di luce,\" p. 211, 221, 275).\r\n\r\n     Thus the Italian negotiators differed notably from M.\r\n     Benedetti in their opinion on this very grave point; in all\r\n     the confidential and evidently sincere relations which they\r\n     had with their own government, they considered a territorial\r\n     and previous arrangement between France and Prussia as a very\r\n     difficult thing, without doubt, but not impossible. We have\r\n     not discussed in our work the question whether it was General\r\n     Govone or M. Benedetti who had judged the situation best; we\r\n     have not even mentioned this divergence of opinions: we have\r\n     only asked how M. Benedetti could have believed that after\r\n     Sadowa and Nikolsburg he would find Prussia accessible to\r\n     arrangements which it had not wished to accept before its\r\n     immense victories and in the midst of an extremely perilous\r\n     crisis? How could he have undertaken on this 5th August[146]\r\n     to demand of M. de Bismarck for France all the left bank of\r\n     the Rhine without excepting the great fortress of Mayence,\r\n     when on the 8th June he was persuaded that one could not\r\n     obtain from Prussia even a territory of the value of the\r\n     county of Glatz? We have given the only possible explanation\r\n     of this contradiction, the only one, we dare affirm, which\r\n     has presented itself to the minds of all those who have\r\n     studied these events. Before the campaign of Bohemia, we\r\n     said, M. Benedetti did not think it possible to obtain\r\n     territorial concessions from Prussia, and had shown all the\r\n     more plainly the difficulties of such a demand which he\r\n     feared to see Prussia refuse and thus render its _connubio_\r\n     with Italy abortive, if they insisted prematurely, too firmly\r\n     on the point of compensations. He desired rather to count on\r\n     the military events to procure advantages for his country,\r\n     on \"the necessities to which the war might reduce the\r\n     Prussian government\" (\"My Mission,\" p. 172), for he did not\r\n     expect any more than the most ordinary of mortals the\r\n     startling blow of Sadowa. After Sadowa he was dismayed at the\r\n     success of the Hohenzollern; patriotic anguish for France\r\n     succeeded in his heart to the generous sympathies for Italy,\r\n     and, as he himself says, \"in view of the important\r\n     acquisitions of Prussia he was of the opinion that a\r\n     territorial remodeling was henceforward necessary for the\r\n     security of France.\" (\"My Mission,\" p. 177). This remodeling\r\n     he had _at first_ hoped to find on the Rhine, \"provided that\r\n     the language of his government was firm and its attitude\r\n     resolute\" (p. 178); he had then sought it on the Meuse and\r\n     the Escaut, and had allowed himself to be drawn into that\r\n     secret negotiation on Belgium which was to be so fatal to\r\n     France.\r\n\r\n     It was probably not the _patriotic anguish_ attributed by us\r\n     to M. Benedetti on the day after Sadowa, that could have\r\n     wounded his feelings. Could it be the Italian sympathies with\r\n     which we have credited him that awakened his\r\n     susceptibilities? But the pronounced liking for the country\r\n     and the cause of M. de Cavour has been the principal and\r\n     marked characteristic of the political life of the former\r\n     ambassador of France to the court of Berlin; in sight, and\r\n     with the knowledge, of every one, M. Benedetti has always\r\n     been reckoned among the most distinguished members of a party\r\n     which had great influence in the councils of the second\r\n     empire, a party which considered Italian unity as the most\r\n     glorious work of the reign, the most useful for France, and,\r\n     in its eyes, the _connubio_ of Italy and Prussia seemed an\r\n     immense good fortune for the imperial policy, a brilliant\r\n     victory gained over the old order of things, to the profit of\r\n     the \"new right\" and Napoleonic ideas! The diplomatic career\r\n     of M. Benedetti, even presents in this respect a character\r\n     of unity and indivisibility which will arouse the eternal\r\n     admiration of all Italian patriots. In 1860 he had negotiated\r\n     and brought to a successful end the treaty on Savoy and Nice,\r\n     in exchange for which the imperial government tore up the\r\n     treaty of Zurich, and sanctioned implicitly the annexations\r\n     of Tuscany and Emilia. In 1861 he was made minister\r\n     plenipotentiary of France to Turin, as if to console Italy\r\n     for the recent death of M. de Cavour, to reestablish in any\r\n     case beyond the Alps the friendly relations which the\r\n     invasion of the kingdom of Naples had for a moment strongly\r\n     compromised. In the summer of the following year (August,\r\n     1862), the harmony between France and Italy was again\r\n     troubled in consequence of Aspromonte, and of the circular of\r\n     General Durando, of the 10th September, which demanded the\r\n     evacuation of Rome. M. Thouvenel was then obliged to leave\r\n     the Hotel of the Quai d'Orsay, giving place to M. Drouyn de\r\n     Lhuys; and M. Benedetti, as well as his colleague of Rome, M.\r\n     de La Valette, hastened to give his resignation, in order to\r\n     mark with _eclat_ his disapprobation as regarded a system\r\n     become less favorable to the aspirations of Italy. He did not\r\n     reenter the career until two years later, the 7th October,\r\n     1864, after the convention of the 15th September had given\r\n     satisfaction to the wishes of the cabinet of Turin concerning\r\n     Rome, also after M. de Bismarck had passed by Paris and had\r\n     placed there the first beacons of the great combination\r\n     against Austria. The post at Berlin was then raised to an\r\n     embassy, and M. Benedetti became the holder of it. His former\r\n     colleague of Rome, M. de La Valette, did not delay to sit in\r\n     the councils of the empire, and at the same moment General La\r\n     Marmora, well known for his _Prussomania_, undertook the\r\n     direction of affairs at Turin. And from the beginning of the\r\n     year 1865, M. de Bismarck engaged in his first campaign\r\n     against Austria concerning the Duchies, and made his first\r\n     proceedings at Florence to combine an understanding with\r\n     Italy. The _connubio_ was not definitely consummated until\r\n     April, 1866, under the eyes of M. Benedetti.\r\n\r\n     No one that we know (and we less than any one) has reproached\r\n     M. Benedetti with having favored this _connubio without the\r\n     knowledge of his government_; but M. Benedetti will doubtless\r\n     not pretend that this understanding between Italy and Prussia\r\n     did not have all his sympathies. General Govone had no\r\n     confidences for him at Berlin, perhaps; it was M. Benedetti,\r\n     on the contrary, who made the Italian negotiator precious\r\n     confidences,--that one among others, \"that M. de Bismarck was\r\n     a sort of _maniac_, whom he (Benedetti) knew and had\r\n     _followed_ for nearly fifteen years.\"[147] He had advised\r\n     him, also, \"not to sign any treaty, but only to have a\r\n     project thoroughly discussed and ready to sign when the\r\n     mobilization of Prussia should be achieved.\" Would M.\r\n     Benedetti seek to persuade that by this advice he had wished\r\n     to hinder the _connubio_? No, assuredly, by such advice M.\r\n     Benedetti told General Govone to act only in earnest. It was\r\n     good counsel that he gave him. Now one does not give good\r\n     counsel for an affair which one wishes to see go under.\r\n     Moreover, it was not the Italians that it was necessary to\r\n     render favorable to the _connubio_; they inclined to it\r\n     naturally: the important part was to gain over the court of\r\n     Berlin, to triumph over its scruples, to reassure it, above\r\n     all, as to the intentions of France. \"I think that I should\r\n     announce to you,\" the Italian negotiator telegraphed on the\r\n     28th March to General La Marmora, \"that the president (M. de\r\n     Bismarck) keeps M. Benedetti exactly informed.\"[148] M. de\r\n     Bismarck would certainly not have thought of keeping M.\r\n     Benedetti so exactly informed, if he had credited him with an\r\n     aversion or even a lukewarmness for the Italian marriage.\r\n     Then, as since, in France as well as abroad, in the eyes of\r\n     the publicists as well as in the eyes of his own chiefs (as\r\n     we are going to prove immediately), the former ambassador of\r\n     France to the court of Berlin has always passed for the agent\r\n     of the imperial government who wished most ardently for the\r\n     success of the Italo-Prussian combination, and the book, \"My\r\n     Mission in Prussia,\" has not succeeded at all in shaking a\r\n     conviction which we do not fear to call general.\r\n\r\n     We would never have thought of intruding in such an important\r\n     debate our obscure person and our humble writings; but, since\r\n     M. Benedetti has kindly wished to recognize in the works\r\n     previously published by us in the \"Revue des deux Mondes,\"\r\n     \"studies better prepared and more impartially written,\" we\r\n     feel less hesitation in quoting one of those pages which we\r\n     consecrated even here seven years ago to that pathetic\r\n     episode of contemporaneous history. Speaking in our\r\n     \"Preliminaries of Sadowa,\" of the treaty negotiated between\r\n     M. de Bismarck and General Govone in the spring of 1866, we\r\n     expressed ourselves as follows: \"There was only one strong\r\n     mind like M. de Bismarck to enter into a compact with this\r\n     secretary of the dreaded kingdom who assisted his colleague\r\n     the Count de Barral; in the depths M. Benedetti appeared from\r\n     time to time. In this respect, we involuntarily stretch our\r\n     hand toward that volume of Machiavelli; we are seized with a\r\n     desire to re-read a chapter from the \"Legazioni.\" How happy\r\n     he would have been, the great Florentine, to contemplate his\r\n     three compatriots fighting with a _barbarian_! At Paris, one\r\n     only saw (in this treaty) the single, prodigious fact of a\r\n     pact concluded between a monarch by the grace of God, and a\r\n     king of the national will, and one went into ecstacies over\r\n     the skill of M. Benedetti. There was only one diplomat of the\r\n     new school who could perform such a miracle!\" Lastly, at the\r\n     beginning of the same study, in relating the circumstances\r\n     which in 1864 had brought on the political stage those\r\n     formerly disgraced by the affair Durando, we said: \"Without\r\n     doubt it cost M. Drouyn de Lhuys something to accept as a\r\n     colleague M. de La Valette, who made no secret of his desire\r\n     to take his department from him; it cost him still more,\r\n     probably, to allow such an open adversary as M. Benedetti to\r\n     be imposed on him as principal agent. Two years later, after\r\n     Sadowa, and on the day when he gave up his portfolio, the\r\n     same minister was yet to countersign another decree which\r\n     raised M. Benedetti to the dignity of the grand cross. Who\r\n     knows, however, whether, in the mind of M. Drouyn de Lhuys,\r\n     this second signature was not destined to avenge somewhat the\r\n     first? In truth, perhaps that was a peculiar trait of mind, a\r\n     Parthian trait, to distinguish so highly an agent for having\r\n     only too well served a policy the responsibility of which he\r\n     not the less repudiated.\"[149]\r\n\r\n     Did the former chiefs of the ex-ambassador of France to the\r\n     court of Berlin judge otherwise of it? M. Benedetti himself\r\n     furnishes us on this point with valuable testimony, which we\r\n     will take care not to neglect. He says (\"My Mission,\" p. 148)\r\n     that in January, 1870, M. Daru, then minister of foreign\r\n     affairs, had made, in a letter, allusion to the events of\r\n     1866, in terms which could not but strongly affect the\r\n     ambassador: \"The territorial state of Prussia,\" M. Daru had\r\n     written him, \"results from events which _perhaps_ it has not\r\n     depended on you to bring about.\" Thus, even four years after\r\n     Sadowa, they did not cease to attribute to M. Benedetti, to\r\n     the bureaux of the Quai d'Orsay, a notable part in these\r\n     gloomy events. The ambassador found it opportune to enlighten\r\n     his new chief on \"the _role_ which he played in this\r\n     circumstance,\" by a private letter dated the 27th January,\r\n     1870. \"I am not ignorant,\" we read there, \"of all that has\r\n     been said on this point; but, by a feeling which you will\r\n     appreciate, I do not doubt, I have never thought of declining\r\n     the share of responsibility which has been cast on me, and,\r\n     for this purpose, to set at right the errors too easily\r\n     gathered by a badly informed public.\" He affirmed, therefore,\r\n     that he was then \"an active, correct, foreseeing informer,\"\r\n     and he appeals to his correspondence deposited in the\r\n     archives of foreign affairs. \"I should add that I never, _and\r\n     in none of the missions which I have fulfilled_, have\r\n     undertaken other correspondences than those whose marks exist\r\n     in the department, or in the hands of your predecessors, and\r\n     that I never had, _in all the epochs of my career_, other\r\n     orders to execute than those that have been given me directly\r\n     through them.\" (\"My Mission,\" pp. 148-149). Yet that is not\r\n     sufficient for M. Benedetti, and in publishing this letter he\r\n     accompanies it (p. 150) with a triumphant commentary: \"I have\r\n     affirmed a fixed and indubitable fact in mentioning, in my\r\n     letter (to M. Daru), that I did not have the honor, _on any\r\n     occasion_ (these words are underlined by M. Benedetti\r\n     himself), to sustain a direct and confidential correspondence\r\n     with the emperor. He has deigned to grant me his confidence,\r\n     and occasionally to testify to me his satisfaction; he has\r\n     never ceased to transmit to me his orders by the mediation of\r\n     his minister of foreign affairs, with whom I have exclusively\r\n     corresponded. No one will suppose, I think, that I would\r\n     affirm this in such absolute terms as I have in writing to M.\r\n     Daru, my immediate chief, if I had not been fully\r\n     authorized.\"\r\n\r\n     Unfortunately some pages beyond (p. 194), M. Benedetti is\r\n     forced to acknowledge that, in his negotiation concerning the\r\n     secret treaty on Belgium, he exchanged a correspondence which\r\n     did not pass through the department for foreign affairs, and\r\n     which the directing minister of this department did not know\r\n     of. \"I thought it fitting,\" we read there, \"to address to the\r\n     minister of state, M. Rouher, the letter in which I announced\r\n     my interview with M. de Bismarck, and which accompanied the\r\n     plan of the treaty relating to Belgium. M. Rouher did not lay\r\n     before the ministry, not having then undertaken the direction\r\n     of it, the correspondence which during several days I\r\n     exchanged with him.\" It is true that, in order to palliate\r\n     this very grave irregularity, M. Benedetti pretends that M.\r\n     Drouyn de Lhuys had offered his resignation toward the middle\r\n     of August: \"At this moment there was no minister of foreign\r\n     affairs;\" but we have proved to him that M. Drouyn de Lhuys\r\n     did not lose his portfolio until the 1st September, 1866. Up\r\n     to that date, M. Drouyn de Lhuys had not ceased to direct the\r\n     department, with the desire of remaining there, and of\r\n     preventing the complete abandonment of the traditional French\r\n     policy. The ambassador himself quotes in his book several\r\n     dispatches exchanged with him on grave questions, up to the\r\n     date of the 21st and 25th August (pages 204 and 223); but M.\r\n     Benedetti thought _proper_ to be silent to his immediate\r\n     chief concerning the negotiation on the subject of the treaty\r\n     on Belgium, and only to inform the minister of state. This\r\n     negotiation not only had its beginning, but also its end (it\r\n     was broken off by M. de Bismarck the 29th August), _during\r\n     the ministry of M. Drouyn de Lhuys, and without his\r\n     knowledge_. This was then _one occasion_ when M. Benedetti\r\n     did not exclusively correspond with the minister of foreign\r\n     affairs! There was then _one epoch in the career_ of M.\r\n     Benedetti when he received orders which did not pass through\r\n     the Quai d'Orsay! And how suppose of the honorable M. Daru\r\n     that what had happened in the month of August, 1866, could\r\n     have also taken place in the months of March and April of the\r\n     same year?\r\n\r\n     M. Benedetti completely ignores in his protest this incident\r\n     of the treaty concerning Belgium; it is, however, the\r\n     culminating point, in fact the only grave point of the\r\n     debate, and the only one concerning which we allowed\r\n     ourselves to reproach him with having acted _without the\r\n     knowledge_, not of his government, but _of his minister_.\r\n     Would M. Benedetti perhaps find that this is an anecdotal\r\n     incident, incompatible with the dignity of history? He had in\r\n     fact first tried, in his letter published in the \"Moniteur,\"\r\n     the 29th July, 1870, to give to this deplorable event an\r\n     entirely anecdotal turn, to assign to the compromising\r\n     document a, so to say, spontaneous generation; he would have\r\n     wished to give only an exact account of the ideas of M. de\r\n     Bismarck, and \"consented to transcribe them in a manner under\r\n     his dictation.\" He could not long persist in such trifling;\r\n     he had to avow in his book that he had entered on a veritable\r\n     negotiation, and M. de Bismarck has since then taken\r\n     malicious pleasure in casting light on the different phases\r\n     of this negotiation, by different extracts taken from the\r\n     papers of Cercay and published in the \"Moniteur prussien,\" in\r\n     reply to the book of M. Benedetti. \"During my long career,\"\r\n     says M. Benedetti, in the preface of his book (p. 4), \"I have\r\n     been charged only on three different occasions with opening\r\n     negotiations having a fixed object, and leaving me with an\r\n     initiative part proportionate to the responsibility.\" He\r\n     enumerates these three negotiations and proves that he\r\n     conducted them all to a good end, but he takes good care not\r\n     to include in the number his negotiations on Belgium, in\r\n     which he was given an initiative part, and in which we will\r\n     also give him his proportional part of the responsibility.\r\n\r\n     We will also leave him the tone of his polemics; it is like\r\n     his diplomacy, _sui generis_, and we can say with M. de\r\n     Bismarck: \"M. Benedetti is too clever for us.\"\r\n\r\n                                             JULIAN KLACZKO.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE MISSION EXTRAORDINARY OF MR. FOX.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 16th April (according to the Russian calendar, the 4th),\r\n1866, an attempt was made on the life of Alexander II., Emperor of\r\nRussia. The would-be assassin was a Russian named Dmitry Karakozoff, a\r\nmember of the order of the Nihilists. The rescuer of the Czar was a\r\nnewly-emancipated serf, Ossip Ivanovitch Komissaroff by name. The facts\r\nof the attempted assassination are as follows: In the morning of that\r\nday Komissaroff started for the chapel built by Peter the Great on an\r\nisland in the Neva. The bridge between the main bank and the island had,\r\nhowever, been removed, and he therefore turned toward the palace quay.\r\nOn approaching the Summer Garden he joined the crowd of people waiting\r\nto see the Emperor pass. While trying to secure a favorable position,\r\nKomissaroff was attracted by a stranger who was attempting to force his\r\nway to the front, and who kept his right hand constantly in his coat\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nWhen the Emperor appeared, the man beside Komissaroff drew a pistol and\r\naimed it at his Majesty. He stood so near that the shot would\r\nundoubtedly have proved fatal, had not Komissaroff struck up his arm\r\nand caused the weapon to be discharged in the air. Karakozoff was\r\nseized, and after trial, was executed on the 15th September. Komissaroff\r\nwas made a nobleman, and had gifts and orders showered on him by the\r\nscore. Mr. Clay, our minister to Russia, delivered a congratulatory\r\naddress to the Emperor at a special audience, and the Emperor returned\r\nhis thanks to the President and the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Congress, remembering that Russia had given our nation\r\nits warmest sympathies and aid in our hour of peril, introduced a joint\r\nresolution, relative to the attempted assassination of the Emperor of\r\nRussia. The resolution was approved by President Johnson, and it was\r\nthen resolved to send a special envoy in a national vessel to carry to\r\nthe Emperor of Russia the congratulations at his providential escape.\r\nFor this delicate mission the Hon. Gustavus Vasa Fox, the Assistant\r\nSecretary of the Navy, was chosen. At his own request it was determined\r\nto send him in a monitor, a class of vessel which had never crossed the\r\nAtlantic, but in whose seaworthiness Mr. Fox trusted implicitly. For\r\nthis purpose the _Miantonomoh_, a two-turret monitor, to be accompanied\r\nby two wooden men-of-war, was selected. On June 5, 1866, Mr. Fox left\r\nSt. John, N. B., for Queenstown, arriving there on June 16th. Mr. Fox\r\nthen left the _Miantonomoh_, and made short trips through England,\r\nIreland, and France. He rejoined the squadron at Copenhagen on Saturday,\r\nJuly 21st, and after having been hospitably entertained by the king,\r\nleft on August 1st for Cronstadt. He arrived there on August 5th, and on\r\nthe following day he went to St. Petersburg and paid his respects to Mr.\r\nClay, the United States Minister there. On the 8th the mission was\r\nreceived at Peterhof by the Emperor, assisted by Prince Gortchakof. Mr.\r\nFox addressed the Emperor, who replied to him through Prince\r\nGortchakof. On August 9th his Majesty visited the ships at Cronstadt.\r\n\r\nFor more than a month a series of dinners and balls were given in honor\r\nof the mission, and Mr. Fox's progress throughout the country was a\r\nperfect ovation. He was made honorary citizen of all the large cities;\r\nhe received delegations of peasants, and was honored with rich presents\r\nfrom the Emperor. The tact and eminent social qualities which he\r\ndisplayed, made this altogether unique mission successful, and greatly\r\nstrengthened the warm ties which exist between the two countries. It\r\nwill be seen that M. Klaczko erroneously calls Mr. Fox \"assistant\r\nsecretary of state.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[146] We have said: \"How could he undertake to present to M. de Bismarck\r\nthe _demands of the cabinet of the Tuileries_?\" and M. Benedetti sees in\r\nthe word undertake the insinuation of an initiative. We have, however,\r\nvery explicitly said, _The demands of the cabinet of the Tuileries_, and\r\nwe immediately added M. Benedetti's own expressions: \"_I have provoked\r\nnothing_, still less have I guaranteed the success; I have only allowed\r\nmyself to _hope_ for it.\" None of our readers could mistake the meaning\r\nof our words, nor, above all, see therein the insinuation which M.\r\nBenedetti gratuitously credits us with.\r\n\r\n[147] \"_Del Conte Bismarck dice (M. de Benedetti) che e un diplomatico\r\nper cosi dire_ MANIACO; _che da quindici anni che to conosce e lo_\r\nSEGUE.\"--Report of General Govone, 6th April, 1866.
