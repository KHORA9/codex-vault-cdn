But in so far as this book\r\ndescribes the growth of Socialist theory in England, and the influence\r\nof Socialism on the political thought of the last thirty years, I hope\r\nit will appeal to a wider circle.\r\n\r\nI have described in my book the care with which the Fabian Tracts have\r\nbeen revised and edited by members of the Executive Committee. Two of my\r\ncolleagues, Sidney Webb and Bernard Shaw, have been good enough to\r\nrevise this volume in like manner, and I have to thank them for\r\ninnumerable corrections in style, countless suggestions of better words\r\nand phrases, and a number of amplifications and additions, some of which\r\nI have accepted without specific acknowledgment, whilst others for one\r\nreason or another are to be found in notes; and I am particularly\r\ngrateful to Bernard Shaw for two valuable memoranda on the history of\r\nFabian Economics, and on Guild Socialism, which are printed as an\r\nappendix.\r\n\r\nThe MS. or proofs have also been read by Mrs. Sidney Webb, Mrs. Bernard\r\nShaw, Sir Sydney Olivier, Graham Wallas, W. Stephen Sanders, and R.C.K.\r\nEnsor, to each of whom my cordial thanks are due for suggestions,\r\nadditions, and corrections.\r\n\r\nTo Miss Bertha Newcombe I am obliged for permission to reproduce the\r\ninteresting sketch which forms the frontispiece.\r\n\r\nE.R.P.\r\nTHE PENDICLE,\r\nLIMPSFIELD,\r\nSURREY,\r\n\r\n_January_, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I\r\n\r\nThe Sources of Fabian Socialism\r\n\r\n    The ideas of the early eighties--The epoch of Evolution--Sources of\r\n    Fabian ideas--Positivism--Henry George--John Stuart Mill--Robert\r\n    Owen--Karl Marx--The Democratic Federation--\"The Christian\r\n    Socialist\"--Thomas Davidson\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\nThe Foundations of the Society: 1883-4\r\n\r\n    Frank Podmore and Ghost-hunting--Thomas Davidson and his circle--The\r\n    preliminary meetings--The Fellowship of the New Life--Formation of\r\n    the Society--The career of the New Fellowship\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\nThe Early Days: 1884-6\r\n\r\n    The use of the word Socialism--Approval of the Democratic\r\n    Federation--Tract No. I--The Fabian Motto--Bernard Shaw joins--His\r\n    first Tract--The Industrial Remuneration Conference--Sidney Webb and\r\n    Sydney Olivier become members--Mrs. Annie Besant--Shaw's second\r\n    Tract--The Tory Gold controversy--\"What Socialism Is\"--The Fabian\r\n    Conference of 1886--Sidney Webb's first contribution, \"The\r\n    Government Organisation of Unemployed Labour\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\nThe Formation of Fabian Policy: 1886-9\r\n\r\n    The factors of success; priority of date; the men who made it--The\r\n    controversy over policy--The Fabian Parliamentary League--\"Facts for\r\n    Socialists\"--The adoption of the Basis--The seven Essayists in\r\n    command--Lord Haldane--The \"Essays\" as Lectures--How to train for\r\n    Public Life--Fabians on the London School Board--\"Facts for\r\n    Londoners\"--Municipal Socialism--\"The Eight Hours Bill\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\n\"Fabian Essays\" and the Lancashire Campaign: 1890-3\r\n\r\n    \"Fabian Essays\" published--Astonishing success--A new presentation\r\n    of Socialism--Reviewed after twenty-five years--Henry\r\n    Hutchinson--The Lancashire Campaign--Mrs. Besant withdraws--\"Fabian\r\n    News\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\n\"To your tents, O Israel\": 1894-1900\r\n\r\n    Progress of the Society--The Independent Labour Party--Local Fabian\r\n    Societies--University Fabian Societies--London Groups and Samuel\r\n    Butler--The first Fabian Conference--Tracts and Lectures--The 1892\r\n    Election Manifesto--The Newcastle Program--The Fair Wages\r\n    Policy--The \"Fortnightly\" article--The Intercepted Letter of 1906\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\n\"Fabianism and the Empire\": 1900-1\r\n\r\n    The Library and Book Boxes--Parish Councils--The Workmen's\r\n    Compensation Act--The Hutchinson Trust--The London School of\r\n    Economics--Educational Lectures--Electoral Policy--The controversy\r\n    over the South African War--The publication of \"Fabianism and the\r\n    Empire\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\nEducation: 1902-5, and the Labour Party: 1900-15\r\n\r\n    Housing--\"The Education muddle and the way out\"--Supporting the\r\n    Conservatives--The Education Acts of 1902 and 1903--Feeding School\r\n    Children--The Labour Representation Committee formed--The Fabian\r\n    Election Fund--Will Crooks elected in 1910--A Fabian Cabinet\r\n    Minister--Resignation of Graham Wallas--The younger generation: H.W.\r\n    Macrosty, J.F.

Ireland is\r\nstill a bone of contention between political parties: the Channel tunnel\r\nis no nearer completion: and then as now, when other topics are\r\nexhausted, the \"Spectator\" can fill up its columns with Thought\r\nTransference and Psychical Research.\r\n\r\nBut other problems which then were vital, are now almost forgotten.\r\nElectric lighting was a doubtful novelty: Mr. Bradlaugh's refusal to\r\ntake the oath excited a controversy which now seems incredible. Robert\r\nLouis Stevenson can no longer be adequately described as an\r\n\"accomplished writer,\" and the introduction of female clerks into the\r\npostal service by Mr. Fawcett has ceased to raise alarm lest the\r\ncourteous practice of always allowing ladies to be victors in an\r\nargument should perforce be abandoned.\r\n\r\nBut in September of the same year we find a cloud on the horizon, the\r\nprelude of a coming storm. The Trade Union Congress had just been held\r\nand the leaders of the working classes, with apparently but little\r\ndiscussion, had passed a resolution asking the Government to institute\r\nan enquiry with a view to relaxing the stringency of Poor Law\r\nadministration. This, said the \"Spectator,\" is beginning \"to tamper with\r\nnatural conditions,\" \"There is no logical halting-place between the\r\ntheory that it is the duty of the State to make the poor comfortable,\r\nand socialism.\"\r\n\r\nAnother factor in the thought of those days attracted but little\r\nattention in the Press, though there is a long article in the\r\n\"Spectator\" at the beginning of 1882 on \"the ever-increasing wonder\" of\r\nthat strange faith, \"Positivism.\" It is difficult for the present\r\ngeneration to realise how large a space in the minds of the young men of\r\nthe eighties was occupied by the religion invented by Auguste Comte. Of\r\nthis however more must be said on a later page.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most significant feature in the periodical literature of\r\nthe time is what it omits. April, 1882, is memorable for the death of\r\nCharles Darwin, incomparably the greatest of nineteenth-century\r\nEnglishmen, if greatness be measured by the effects of his work on the\r\nthought of the world. The \"Spectator\" printed a secondary article which\r\nshowed some appreciation of the event. But in the monthly reviews it\r\npassed practically unnoticed. It is true that Darwin was buried in\r\nWestminster Abbey, but even in 1882, twenty-three years after the\r\npublication of the \"Origin of Species,\" evolution was regarded as a\r\nsomewhat dubious theorem which respectable people were wise to ignore.\r\n\r\nIn the monthly reviews we find the same odd mixture of articles apposite\r\nto present problems, and articles utterly out of date. The organisation\r\nof agriculture is a perennial, and Lady Verney's \"Peasant Proprietorship\r\nin France\" (\"Contemporary,\" January, 1882), Mr. John Rae's \"Co-operative\r\nAgriculture in Germany\" (\"Contemporary,\" March, 1882), and Professor\r\nSedley Taylor's \"Profit-Sharing in Agriculture\" (\"Nineteenth Century,\"\r\nOctober, 1882) show that change in the methods of exploiting the soil is\r\nleaden-footed and lagging.\r\n\r\nProblems of another class, centring round \"the Family,\" present much the\r\nsame aspect now as they did thirty years ago. In his \"Infant Mortality\r\nand Married Women in Factories,\" Professor Stanley Jevons\r\n(\"Contemporary,\" January, 1882) proposes that mothers of children under\r\nthree years of age should be excluded from factories, and we are at\r\npresent perhaps even farther from general agreement whether any measure\r\non these lines ought to be adopted.\r\n\r\nBut when we read the articles on Socialism--more numerous than might be\r\nexpected at that early date--we are in another world. Mr. Samuel Smith,\r\nM.P., writing on \"Social Reform\" in the \"Nineteenth Century\" for May,\r\n1883, says that: \"Our country is still comparatively free from\r\nCommunism and Nihilism and similar destructive movements, but who can\r\ntell how long this will continue? We have a festering mass of human\r\nwretchedness in all our great towns, which is the natural hotbed of such\r\nanarchical movements: all the great continental countries are full of\r\nthis explosive material. Can we depend on our country keeping free from\r\nthe infection when we have far more poverty in our midst than the\r\nneighbouring European States?\" Emigration and temperance reform, he\r\nthinks, may avert the danger.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Samuel (later Canon) Barnett in the same review a month earlier\r\nadvocated Free Libraries and graduated taxation to pay for free\r\neducation, under the title of \"Practicable Socialism.\" In April, 1883,\r\nEmile de Lavelaye described with alarm the \"Progress of Socialism.\" \"On\r\nthe Continent,\" he wrote, \"Socialism is said to be everywhere.\" To it he\r\nattributed with remarkable inaccuracy, the agrarian movement in Ireland,\r\nand with it he connected the fact that Henry George's new book,\r\n\"Progress and Poverty,\" was selling by thousands \"in an ultra popular\r\nform\" in the back streets and alleys of England. And then he goes on to\r\nallude to Prince Bismarck's \"abominable proposition to create a fund for\r\npensioning invalid workmen by a monopoly of tobacco\"!\r\n\r\nThirty years ago politics were only intermittently concerned with social\r\nproblems. On the whole the view prevailed, at any rate amongst the\r\nleaders, that Government should interfere in such matters as little as\r\npossible. Pauperism was still to be stamped out by ruthless deterrence:\r\neducation had been only recently and reluctantly taken in hand: factory\r\ninspection alone was an accepted State function. Lord Beaconsfield was\r\ndead and he had forgotten his zeal for social justice long before he\r\nattained power. Gladstone, then in the zenith of his fame, never took\r\nany real interest in social questions as we now understand them. Lord\r\nSalisbury was an aristocrat and thought as an aristocrat. John Bright\r\nviewed industrial life from the standpoint of a Lancashire mill-owner.\r\nWilliam Edward Forster, the creator of national education, a Chartist in\r\nhis youth, had become the gaoler of Parnell and the protagonist of\r\ncoercion in Ireland. Joseph Chamberlain alone seemed to realise the\r\nsignificance of the social problem, and unhappily political events were\r\nsoon to deflect his career from what then seemed to be its appointed\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe political parties therefore offered very little attraction to the\r\nyoung men of the early eighties, who, viewing our social system with the\r\nfresh eyes of youth, saw its cruelties and its absurdities and judged\r\nthem, not as older men, by comparison with the worse cruelties and\r\ngreater absurdities of earlier days, but by the standard of common\r\nfairness and common sense, as set out in the lessons they had learned in\r\ntheir schools, their universities, and their churches.\r\n\r\nIt is nowadays not easy to recollect how wide was the intellectual gulf\r\nwhich separated the young generation of that period from their parents.\r\n\"The Origin of Species,\" published in 1859, inaugurated an intellectual\r\nrevolution such as the world had not known since Luther nailed his\r\nTheses to the door of All Saints' Church at Wittenberg. The older folk\r\nas a rule refused to accept or to consider the new doctrine. I recollect\r\na botanical Fellow of the Royal Society who, in 1875, told me that he\r\nhad no opinions on Darwin's hypothesis. The young men of the time I am\r\ndescribing grew up with the new ideas and accepted them as a matter of\r\ncourse. Herbert Spencer, then deemed the greatest of English thinkers,\r\nwas pointing out in portentous phraseology the enormous significance of\r\nEvolution. Professor Huxley, in brilliant essays, was turning to\r\nridicule the simple-minded credulity of Gladstone and his\r\ncontemporaries. Our parents, who read neither Spencer nor Huxley, lived\r\nin an intellectual world which bore no relation to our own; and cut\r\nadrift as we were from the intellectual moorings of our upbringings,\r\nrecognising, as we did, that the older men were useless as guides in\r\nreligion, in science, in philosophy because they knew not evolution, we\r\nalso felt instinctively that we could accept nothing on trust from those\r\nwho still believed that the early chapters of Genesis accurately\r\ndescribed the origin of the universe, and that we had to discover\r\nsomewhere for ourselves what were the true principles of the then\r\nrecently invented science of sociology.\r\n\r\nOne man there was who professed to offer us an answer, Auguste Comte. He\r\ntoo was pre-Darwinian, but his philosophy accepted science, future as\r\nwell as past. John Stuart Mill, whose word on his own subjects was then\r\nalmost law, wrote of him with respectful admiration. His followers were\r\nknown to number amongst them some of the ablest thinkers of the day. The\r\n\"Religion of Humanity\" offered solutions for all the problems that faced\r\nus. It suggested a new heaven, of a sort, and it proposed a new earth,\r\nfree from all the inequalities of wealth, the preventable suffering, the\r\nreckless waste of effort, which we saw around us. At any rate, it was\r\nworth examination; and most of the free-thinking men of that period read\r\nthe \"Positive Polity\" and the other writings of the founder, and spent\r\nsome Sunday mornings at the little conventicle in Lamb's Conduit Street,\r\nor attended on Sunday evenings the Newton Hall lectures of Frederic\r\nHarrison.\r\n\r\nFew could long endure the absurdities of a made-up theology and a\r\nmake-believe religion: and the Utopia designed by Comte was as\r\nimpracticable and unattractive as Utopias generally are. But the\r\ncritical and destructive part of the case was sound enough. Here was a\r\nman who challenged the existing order of society and pronounced it\r\nwrong. It was in his view based on conventions, on superstitions, on\r\nregulations which were all out of date; society should be reorganised in\r\nthe light of pure reason; the anarchy of competition must be brought to\r\nan end; mankind should recognise that order, good sense, science, and,\r\nhe added, religion freed from superstition, could turn the world into a\r\nplace where all might live together in comfort and happiness.\r\n\r\nPositivism proposed to attain its Utopia by moralising the capitalists,\r\nand herein it showed no advance on Christianity, which for nineteen\r\ncenturies had in vain preached social obligation to the rich. The new\r\ncreed could not succeed where the old, with all its tremendous\r\nsanctions, had completely failed. We wanted something fresh, some new\r\nmethod of dealing with the inequalities of wealth.\r\n\r\nEmile de Lavelaye was quite correct in attributing significance to the\r\npublication of \"Progress and Poverty,\" though the seed sown by Henry\r\nGeorge took root, not in the slums and alleys of our cities--no\r\nintellectual seed of any sort can germinate in the sickly, sunless\r\natmosphere of slums--but in the minds of people who had sufficient\r\nleisure and education to think of other things than breadwinning. Henry\r\nGeorge proposed to abolish poverty by political action: that was the new\r\ngospel which came from San Francisco in the early eighties. \"Progress\r\nand Poverty\" was published in America in 1879, and its author visited\r\nEngland at the end of 1881. Socialism hardly existed at that time in\r\nEnglish-speaking countries, but the early advocates of land taxation\r\nwere not then, as they usually are now, uncompromising individualists.\r\n\"Progress and Poverty\" gave an extraordinary impetus to the political\r\nthought of the time. It proposed to redress the wrongs suffered by the\r\nworking classes as a whole: the poverty it considered was the poverty of\r\nthe wage workers as a class, not the destitution of the unfortunate and\r\ndowntrodden individuals. It did not merely propose, like philanthropy\r\nand the Poor Law, to relieve the acute suffering of the outcasts of\r\ncivilisation, those condemned to wretchedness by the incapacity, the\r\nvice, the folly, or the sheer misfortune of themselves or their\r\nrelations. It suggested a method by which wealth would correspond\r\napproximately with worth; by which the reward of labour would go to\r\nthose that laboured; the idleness alike of rich and poor would cease;\r\nthe abundant wealth created by modern industry would be distributed with\r\nsomething like fairness and even equality, amongst those who contributed\r\nto its production. Above all, this tremendous revolution was to be\r\naccomplished by a political method, applicable by a majority of the\r\nvoters, and capable of being drafted as an Act of Parliament by any\r\ncompetent lawyer.\r\n\r\nTo George belongs the extraordinary merit of recognising the right way\r\nof social salvation. The Socialists of earlier days had proposed\r\nsegregated communities; the Co-operators had tried voluntary\r\nassociations; the Positivists advocated moral suasion; the Chartists\r\nfavoured force, physical or political; the Marxists talked revolution\r\nand remembered the Paris Commune. George wrote in a land where the\r\npeople ruled themselves, not only in fact but also in name. The United\r\nStates in the seventies was not yet dominated by trusts and controlled\r\nby millionaires. Indeed even now that domination and control, dangerous\r\nand disastrous as it often is, could not withstand for a moment any\r\nwidespread uprising of the popular will. Anyway, George recognised that\r\nin the Western States political institutions could be moulded to suit\r\nthe will of the electorate; he believed that the majority desired to\r\nseek their own well-being and this could not fail to be also the\r\nwell-being of the community as a whole. From Henry George I think it may\r\nbe taken that the early Fabians learned to associate the new gospel with\r\nthe old political method.\r\n\r\nBut when we came to consider the plan proposed by George we quickly saw\r\nthat it would not carry us far. Land may be the source of all wealth to\r\nthe mind of a settler in a new country. To those whose working day was\r\npassed in Threadneedle Street and Lombard Street, on the floor of the\r\nStock Exchange, and in the Bank of England, land appears to bear no\r\nrelation at all to wealth, and the allegation that the whole surplus of\r\nproduction goes automatically to the landowners is obviously untrue.\r\nGeorge's political economy was old-fashioned or absurd; and his solution\r\nof the problem of poverty could not withstand the simplest criticism.\r\nTaxation to extinction of the rent of English land would only affect a\r\nsmall fraction of England's wealth.\r\n\r\nThere was another remedy in the field. Socialism was talked about in the\r\nreviews: some of us knew that an obscure Socialist movement was stirring\r\ninto life in London. And above all John Stuart Mill had spoken very\r\nrespectfully of Socialism in his \"Political Economy,\" which then held\r\nunchallenged supremacy as an exposition of the science. If, he wrote,\r\n\"the choice were to be made between Communism[1] with all its chances,\r\nand the present state of society with all its sufferings and injustices,\r\nif the institution of private property necessarily carried with it as a\r\nconsequence that the produce of labour should be apportioned as we now\r\nsee it almost in inverse proportion to labour, the largest portions to\r\nthose who have never worked at all, the next largest to those whose work\r\nis almost nominal, and so in descending scale, the remuneration\r\ndwindling as the work grows harder and more disagreeable until the most\r\nfatiguing and exhausting bodily labour cannot count with certainty on\r\nbeing able to earn even the necessities of life; if this or Communism\r\nwere the alternative, all the difficulties, great or small, of Communism\r\nwould be but as dust in the balance.\"[2] And again in the next\r\nparagraph: \"We are too ignorant, either of what individual agency in its\r\nbest form or Socialism in its best form can accomplish, to be qualified\r\nto decide which of the two will be the ultimate form of human society.\"\r\n\r\nMore than thirty years had passed since this had been written, and\r\nwhilst the evils of private property, so vividly depicted by Mill,\r\nshowed no signs of mitigation, the remedies he anticipated had made no\r\nsubstantial progress. The co-operation of the Rochdale Pioneers had\r\nproved a magnificent success, but its sphere of operations was now\r\nclearly seen to be confined within narrow limits. Profit-sharing then as\r\nnow was a sickly plant barely kept alive by the laborious efforts of\r\nbenevolent professors. Mill's indictment of the capitalist system, in\r\nregard to its effects on social life, was so powerful, his treatment of\r\nthe primitive socialism and communism of his day so sympathetic, that it\r\nis surprising how little it prepared the way for the reception of the\r\nnew ideas. But to some of his readers, at any rate, it suggested that\r\nthere was an alternative to the capitalistic system, and that Socialism\r\nor Communism was worthy of examination.[3]\r\n\r\nThe Socialism of Robert Owen had made a profound impression on the\r\nworking people of England half a century earlier, but the tradition of\r\nit was confined to those who had heard its prophet. Owen, one of the\r\ngreatest men of his age, had no sense of art; his innumerable writings\r\nare unreadable; and both his later excursions into spiritualism, and the\r\nfailure of his communities and co-operative enterprises, had clouded his\r\nreputation amongst those outside the range of his personality. In later\r\nyears we often came across old men who had sat at his feet, and who\r\nrejoiced to hear once more something resembling his teachings: but I do\r\nnot think that, at the beginning, the Owenite tradition had any\r\ninfluence upon us.\r\n\r\nKarl Marx died in London on the 14th March, 1883, but nobody in England\r\nwas then aware that the greatest figure in international politics had\r\npassed away. It is true that Marx had taken a prominent part in founding\r\nthe International at that historic meeting in St. Martin's Town Hall on\r\nSeptember 28th, 1864. The real significance of that episode was\r\nover-rated at the time, and when the International disappeared from\r\nEuropean politics in 1872 the whole thing was forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn Germany Marxian Socialism was already a force, and it was attracting\r\nattention in England, as we have seen. But the personality of Marx must\r\nhave been antipathetic to the English workmen whom he knew, or else he\r\nfailed to make them understand his ideas: at any rate, his socialism\r\nfell on deaf ears, and it may be said to have made no lasting impression\r\non the leaders of English working-class thought. Though he was resident\r\nin England for thirty-four years, Marx remained a German to the last.\r\nHis writings were not translated into English at this period, and Mr.\r\nHyndman's \"England for All,\" published in 1881, which was the first\r\npresentation of his ideas in English, did not even mention his name.\r\nThis book was in fact an extremely moderate proposal to remedy\r\n\"something seriously amiss in the conditions of our everyday life,\" and\r\nthe immediate programme was no more than an eight hours working day,\r\nfree and compulsory education, compulsory construction of working-class\r\ndwellings, and cheap \"transport\" for working-class passengers. It was\r\nthe unauthorised programme of the Democratic Federation which had been\r\nfounded by Mr. Hyndman in 1881. \"Socialism Made Plain,\" the social and\r\npolitical Manifesto of the Democratic Federation (undated, but\r\napparently issued in 1883), is a much stronger document. It deals with\r\nthe distribution of the National Income, giving the workers' share as\r\n300 out of 1300 millions sterling, and demands that the workers should\r\n\"educate, agitate, organise\" in order to get their own. Evidently it\r\nattracted some attention, since we find that the second edition of a\r\npamphlet \"Reply\" by Samuel Smith, M.P., then a person of substantial\r\nimportance, was issued in January, 1884.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1883 Mr. Hyndman published his \"Historical Basis of\r\nSocialism in England,\" which for some time was the text-book of the\r\nDemocratic Federation, but this, of course, was too late to influence\r\nthe founders of the Fabian Society.\r\n\r\nWe were however aware of Marx, and I find that my copy of the French\r\nedition of \"Das Kapital\" is dated 8th October, 1883; but I do not think\r\nthat any of the original Fabians had read the book or had assimilated\r\nits ideas at the time the Society was founded.\r\n\r\nTo some of those who joined the Society in its early days Christian\r\nSocialism opened the way of salvation. The \"Christian Socialist\"[4] was\r\nestablished by a band of persons some of whom were not Socialist and\r\nothers not Christian. It claimed to be the spiritual child of the\r\nChristian Socialist movement of 1848-52, which again was Socialist only\r\non its critical side, and constructively was merely Co-operative\r\nProduction by voluntary associations of workmen. Under the guidance of\r\nthe Rev. Stewart D. Headlam[5] its policy of the revived movement was\r\nLand Reform, particularly on the lines of the Single Tax. The\r\nintroductory article boldly claims the name of Socialist, as used by\r\nMaurice and Kingsley: the July number contains a long article by Henry\r\nGeorge. In September a formal report is given of the work of the\r\nDemocratic Federation. In November Christianity and Socialism are said\r\nto be convertible terms, and in January, 1884, the clerical view of\r\nusury is set forth in an article on the morality of interest. In March\r\nMr. H.H. Champion explains \"surplus value,\" and in April we find a\r\nsympathetic review of the \"Historic Basis of Socialism.\" In April, 1885,\r\nappears a long and full report of a lecture by Bernard Shaw to the\r\nLiberal and Social Union. The greater part of the paper is filled with\r\nLand Nationalisation, Irish affairs--the land agitation in Ireland was\r\nthen at its height--and the propaganda of Henry George: whilst much\r\nspace is devoted to the religious aspect of the social problem. Sydney\r\nOlivier, before he joined the Fabian Society, was one of the managing\r\ngroup, and amongst others concerned in it were the Rev. C.L. Marson and\r\nthe Rev. W.E. Moll. At a later period a Christian Socialist Society was\r\nformed; but our concern here is with the factors which contributed to\r\nthe Fabian Society at its start, and it is not necessary to touch on\r\nother periods of the movement.\r\n\r\nThomas Davidson[6] was the occasion rather than the cause of the\r\nfounding of the Fabian Society. His socialism was ethical and individual\r\nrather than economic and political. He was spiritually a descendant of\r\nthe Utopians of Brook Farm and the Phalanstery, and what he yearned for\r\nwas something in the nature of a community of superior people withdrawn\r\nfrom the world because of its wickedness, and showing by example how a\r\nhigher life might be led. Probably his Scotch common sense recoiled from\r\ndefinitely taking the plunge: I am not aware that he ever actually\r\nproposed that his disciples should form a self-contained community. In a\r\nlecture to the New York Fellowship of the New Life, he said, \"I shall\r\nset out with two assumptions, first, that human life does not consist in\r\nmaterial possession; and second, that it does consist in free spiritual\r\nactivity, of which in this life at least material possession is an\r\nessential condition.\" There is nothing new in this: it is the common\r\nbasis of all religions and ethical systems. But it needs to be\r\nre-stated for each generation, and so stated as to suit each\r\nenvironment. At the time that I am describing Davidson's re-statement\r\nappealed to the small circle of his adherents, though the movement which\r\nhe started had results that he neither expected nor approved.\r\n\r\nI have now indicated the currents of thought which contributed to the\r\nformation of the Fabian Society, so far as I can recover them from\r\nmemory and a survey of the periodical literature of the period. I have\r\nnot included the writings of Ruskin, Socialist in outlook as some of\r\nthem undoubtedly are, because I think that the value of his social\r\nteachings was concealed from most of us at that time by reaction against\r\nhis religious mediævalism, and indifference to his gospel of art. Books\r\nso eminently adapted for young ladies at mid-Victorian schools did not\r\nappeal to modernists educated by Comte and Spencer.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The words Communism and Socialism were interchangeable at that\r\nperiod, e.g. the \"Manifesto of the Communist Party,\" by Karl Marx and\r\nFrederick Engels, 1848.\r\n\r\n[2] \"Political Economy,\" Book II, Chap. i, Sec. 3.\r\n\r\n[3] William Morris attributed to Mill his conversion to Socialism.

London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1907. Thomas Davidson was born\r\nin Aberdeenshire in 1840 of a peasant family; after a brilliant career\r\nat Aberdeen University he settled in America, but travelled much in\r\nEurope. His magnetic personality inspired attachment and admiration in\r\nall he came across. He lectured and wrote incessantly, founded Ethical\r\nSocieties and Schools, and published several volumes on philosophical\r\nsubjects, but his achievements were scarcely commensurate with his\r\nabilities. He died in 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\nThe Foundations of the Society: 1883-4\r\n\r\n   Frank Podmore and Ghost-hunting--Thomas Davidson and his circle--The\r\n   preliminary meetings--The Fellowship of the New Life--Formation of\r\n   the Society--The career of the New Fellowship.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1883 Thomas Davidson paid a short visit to London and\r\nheld several little meetings of young people, to whom he expounded his\r\nideas of a Vita Nuova, a Fellowship of the New Life. I attended the last\r\nof these meetings held in a bare room somewhere in Chelsea, on the\r\ninvitation of Frank Podmore,[7] whose acquaintance I had made a short\r\ntime previously. We had become friends through a common interest first\r\nin Spiritualism and subsequently in Psychical Research, and it was\r\nwhilst vainly watching for a ghost in a haunted house at Notting\r\nHill--the house was unoccupied: we had obtained the key from the agent,\r\nleft the door unlatched, and returned late at night in the foolish hope\r\nthat we might perceive something abnormal--that he first discussed with\r\nme the teachings of Henry George in \"Progress and Poverty,\" and we found\r\na common interest in social as well as psychical progress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a copyright photograph by Fredk. Hollyer, W_.\r\n\r\nFRANK PODMORE, ABOUT 1895]\r\n\r\nThe English organiser or secretary of the still unformed Davidsonian\r\nFellowship was Percival Chubb, then a young clerk in the Local\r\nGovernment Board, and subsequently a lecturer and head of an Ethical\r\nChurch in New York and St. Louis. Thomas Davidson was about to leave\r\nLondon; and the company he had gathered round him, desirous of further\r\ndiscussing his suggestions, decided to hold another meeting at my rooms.\r\nI was at that time a member of the Stock Exchange and lived in lodgings\r\nfurnished by myself.\r\n\r\nHere then on October 24th, 1883, was held the first of the fortnightly\r\nmeetings, which have been continued with scarcely a break, through nine\r\nmonths of every year, up to the present time. The company that assembled\r\nconsisted in part of the Davidsonian circle and in part of friends of my\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings at this meeting, recorded in the first minute book of\r\nthe Society in the handwriting of Percival Chubb, were as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"THE NEW LIFE\"\r\n\r\n   \"The first general meeting of persons interested in this movement was\r\n   held at Mr. Pease's rooms, 17 Osnaburgh Street, Regent's Park, on\r\n   Wednesday the 24th October, 1883. There were present: Miss Ford, Miss\r\n   Isabella Ford [of Leeds], Mrs. Hinton [widow of James Hinton], Miss\r\n   Haddon [her sister], Mr., Mrs., and Miss Robins, Maurice Adams, H.H.\r\n   Champion, Percival A. Chubb, H. Havelock Ellis, J.L. Joynes, Edward\r\n   R. Pease, Frank Podmore, R.B.P. Frost, and Hamilton Pullen.\r\n\r\n   \"The proceedings were begun by the reading of Mr. Thomas Davidson's\r\n   paper 'The New Life,' read by him at a former assemblage, and after\r\n   it of the Draft of a proposed constitution (Sketch No. 2). [This has\r\n   not been preserved.]\r\n\r\n   \"A general discussion followed on the question as to what was\r\n   possible of achievement in the way of founding a communistic society\r\n   whose members should lead the new higher life foreshadowed in the\r\n   paper just read. The idea of founding a community abroad was\r\n   generally discredited, and it was generally recognised that it would\r\n   not be possible to establish here in England any independent\r\n   community. What could be done perhaps would be for a number of\r\n   persons in sympathy with the main idea to unite for the purpose of\r\n   common living as far as possible on a communistic basis, realising\r\n   amongst themselves the higher life and making it a primary care to\r\n   provide a worthy education for the young. The members would pursue\r\n   their present callings in the world, but they would always aim to\r\n   make the community as far as practicable self-contained and\r\n   self-supporting, combining perhaps to carry on some common business\r\n   or businesses.\r\n\r\n   \"It was eventually arranged to further discuss the matter at another\r\n   meeting which was fixed for a fortnight hence (Wednesday, 7th\r\n   November). Mr. Podmore consented to ask Miss Owen [afterwards Mrs.\r\n   Laurence Oliphant] to attend then and narrate the experiences of the\r\n   New Harmony Community founded by [her grandfather] Robert Owen.\r\n\r\n   \"It was suggested--and the suggestion was approvingly received--that\r\n   undoubtedly the first thing to be done was for those present to\r\n   become thoroughly acquainted with each other. A general introduction\r\n   of each person to the rest of the company was made and the business\r\n   of the meeting being concluded conversation followed,\"\r\n\r\nOn November 7th, the second meeting was held, when a number of new\r\npeople attended, including Hubert Bland, who, I think, had been one of\r\nthe original Davidson group. Miss Owen was unable to be present, and a\r\ndraft constitution was discussed.\r\n\r\n   \"A question was then raised as to the method of conducting the\r\n   proceedings. The appointment of a chairman was proposed, and Mr.\r\n   Pease was appointed. It was suggested that resolutions should be\r\n   passed constituting a society, and, as far as those present were\r\n   concerned, designating its objects. Some exception was taken to this\r\n   course as being an undesirable formality not in harmony with the free\r\n   spirit of the undertaking, but meeting with general approval it was\r\n   followed.\r\n\r\n   \"After some discussion ... the following resolution was proposed and\r\n   agreed to:--\r\n\r\n   \"That an association be formed whose ultimate aim shall be the\r\n   reconstruction of Society in accordance with the highest moral\r\n   possibilities\"\r\n\r\nA Committee consisting of Messrs. Champion (who was not present), Ellis,\r\nJupp, Podmore, and Chubb, and, failing Champion, Pease was appointed to\r\ndraw up and submit proposals, and it was resolved for the future to meet\r\non Fridays, a practice which the Society has maintained ever since.\r\n\r\nThe meeting on November 23rd was attended by thirty-one people, and\r\nincluded Miss Dale Owen, William Clarke, and Frederick Keddell, the\r\nfirst Secretary of the Fabian Society.\r\n\r\nH.H. Champion[8] introduced the proposals of the Committee, including\r\nthe following resolution, which was carried apparently with unanimity:--\r\n\r\n   \"The members of the Society assert that the Competitive system\r\n   assures the happiness and comfort of the few at the expense of the\r\n   suffering of the many and that Society must be reconstituted in such\r\n   a manner as to secure the general welfare and happiness,\"\r\n\r\nThen the minutes go on, indicating already a rift in the Society: \"As\r\nthe resolution referred rather to the material or economic aims of the\r\nSociety and not to its primary spiritual aim, it was agreed that it\r\nshould stand as No. 3, and that another resolution setting forth the\r\nspiritual basis of the Fellowship shall be passed which shall stand as\r\nNo. 2.\"\r\n\r\nIt proved impossible to formulate then and there the spiritual basis of\r\nthe Society, and after several suggestions had been made a new committee\r\nwas appointed. Resolution No. 1 had already been deferred.\r\n\r\nThe next meeting was held on December 7th, when only fifteen were\r\npresent. Hubert Bland occupied the chair, and Dr. Burns-Gibson\r\nintroduced a definite plan as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"THE FELLOWSHIP OF NEW LIFE\r\n\r\n   _Object_.--The cultivation of a perfect character in each and all.\r\n\r\n   _Principle_.--The subordination of material things to spiritual.\r\n\r\n   _Fellowship_.--The sole and essential condition of fellowship\r\n   shall be a single-minded, sincere, and strenuous devotion to the\r\n   object and principle.\"\r\n\r\nFurther articles touched on the formation of a community, the\r\nsupplanting of the spirit of competition, the highest education of the\r\nyoung, simplicity of living, the importance of manual labour and\r\nreligious communion. Nine names were attached to this project, including\r\nthose of Percival Chubb, Havelock Ellis, and William Clarke, and it was\r\nannounced that a Fellowship would be formed on this basis, whether it\r\nwas accepted or rejected by the majority. These propositions were\r\ndiscussed and no decision was arrived at.\r\n\r\nUp to this point the minutes are recorded in the writing of Percival\r\nChubb. The next entry was made by Frank Podmore, and those after that by\r\nFrederick Keddell.\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at the birthday of the Fabian Society, and the minutes of\r\nthat meeting must be copied in full:--\r\n\r\n   \"Meeting held at 17 Osnaburgh Street, on Friday, 4th January, 1884.\r\n\r\n   \"Present: Mrs. Robins, Miss Robins, Miss Haddon, Miss C. Haddon,\r\n   Messrs. J. Hunter Watts, Hughes, Bland, Keddell, Pease, Stapleton,\r\n   Chubb, Burns-Gibson, Swan, Podmore, Estcourt, etc.\r\n\r\n   \"Mr. Bland took the chair at 8.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n   \"After the minutes of the previous meeting had been read and\r\n   confirmed Dr. Gibson moved the series of resolutions which had been\r\n   read to the Society at the previous meeting.\r\n\r\n   \"Mr. Podmore moved as an amendment the series of resolutions, copies\r\n   of which had been circulated amongst the members a few days\r\n   previously.\r\n\r\n   \"The amendment was carried by 10 votes to 4.\r\n\r\n   [Presumably the 4 included Burns-Gibson, Chubb, and Estcourt, who\r\n   signed the defeated resolutions.]\r\n\r\n   \"Mr. Podmore's proposals were then put forward as substantive\r\n   resolutions and considered seriatim.\r\n\r\n   \"Resolution I.--That the Society be called the Fabian Society (as Mr.\r\n   Podmore explained in allusion to the victorious policy of Fabius\r\n   Cunctator) was carried by 9 votes to 2.\r\n\r\n   \"Resolution II.--That the Society shall not at present pledge its\r\n   members to any more definite basis of agreement than that contained\r\n   in the resolution of 23rd November, 1883.\r\n\r\n   \"Carried unanimously.\r\n\r\n   \"Resolution III.--In place of Mr. Podmore's first proposal it was\r\n   eventually decided to modify the resolution of 7th November, 1883, by\r\n   inserting the words 'to help on' between the words 'shall be' and the\r\n   words 'the reconstruction.'\r\n\r\n   \"Resolution IV with certain omissions was agreed to unanimously,\r\n   viz.: That with the view of learning what practical measures to take\r\n   in this direction the Society should:\r\n\r\n   \"_(a)_ Hold meetings for discussion, the reading of papers,\r\n   hearing of reports, etc.\r\n\r\n   \"_(b)_ Delegate some of its members to attend meetings held on\r\n   social subjects, debates at Workmen's Clubs, etc., in order that such\r\n   members may in the first place report to the Society on the\r\n   proceedings, and in the second place put forward, as occasion serves,\r\n   the views of the Society.\r\n\r\n   \"_(c)_ Take measures in other ways, as, for example, by the\r\n   collection of articles from current literature, to obtain information\r\n   on all contemporary social movements and social needs.\r\n\r\n   \"Mr. Bland, Mr. Keddell, and Mr. Podmore were provisionally appointed\r\n   as an Executive Committee, to serve for three months, on the motion\r\n   of Mr. Pease. A collection was made to provide funds for past\r\n   expenses: the sum collected amounting to 13s. 9d.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that Mr. Bland on this occasion acted as treasurer, though\r\nthere is no record of the fact. He was annually re-elected treasurer and\r\na member of the Executive Committee until he retired from both positions\r\nin 1911.\r\n\r\nThus the Society was founded. Although it appeared to be the outcome of\r\na division of opinion, this was scarcely in fact the case. All those\r\npresent became members, and the relations between the Fabian Society and\r\nthe Fellowship of the New Life were always of a friendly character,\r\nthough in fact the two bodies had but little in common, and seldom came\r\ninto contact.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few words may be devoted to the Fellowship of the New Life, which\r\ncontinued to exist for fifteen years. Its chief achievement was the\r\npublication of a quarterly paper called \"Seedtime,\"[9] issued from July,\r\n1889, to February, 1898. The paper contains articles on Ethical\r\nSocialism, the Simple Life, Humanitarianism, the Education of Children,\r\nand similar subjects. The Society was conducted much on the same lines\r\nas the Fabian Society: fortnightly lectures were given in London and\r\nreported in \"Seedtime.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1893 we find in \"Seedtime\" an Annual Report recording 12 public\r\nmeetings, 4 social gatherings, a membership of 95, and receipts £73.\r\nDuring this year, 1892-3, J. Ramsay Macdonald, subsequently M.P. and\r\nSecretary and Chairman of the Labour Party, was Honorary Secretary, and\r\nfor some years he was on the Executive. In 1896 the membership was 115\r\nand the income £48.\r\n\r\nThe most persistent of the organisers of the New Fellowship was J.F.\r\nOakeshott, who was also for many years a member of the Fabian Executive.\r\nCorrie Grant, later a well-known Liberal M.P., H.S. Salt of the\r\nHumanitarian League, Edward Carpenter, and his brother Captain\r\nCarpenter, Herbert Rix, assistant secretary of the Royal Society,\r\nHavelock Ellis, and, both before and after her marriage, Mrs. Havelock\r\nEllis (who was Honorary Secretary for some years), are amongst the names\r\nwhich appear in the pages of \"Seedtime,\"\r\n\r\nMild attempts were made to carry out the Community idea by means of\r\nassociated colonies (e.g. the members residing near each other) and a\r\nco-operative residence at 49 Doughty Street, Bloomsbury; but close\r\nassociation, especially of persons with the strong and independent\r\nopinions of the average socialist, promotes discord, and against this\r\nthe high ideals of the New Fellowship proved no protection. Indeed it is\r\na common experience that the higher the ideal the fiercer the\r\nhostilities of the idealists.\r\n\r\nAt Thornton Heath, near Croydon, the Fellowship conducted for some time\r\na small printing business, and its concern for the right education for\r\nthe young found expression in a Kindergarten. Later on an Ethical Church\r\nand a Boys' Guild were established at Croydon.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards the Fellowship came to the conclusion that its work was\r\ndone, the last number of \"Seedtime\" was published, and in 1898 the\r\nSociety was dissolved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by G.C.

The resolutions already recorded,\r\nadvocating the reconstruction of society on a non-competitive basis with\r\nthe object of remedying the evils of poverty, embody the essence of\r\nSocialism, and our first publication, Tract No. 1, was so thorough-going\r\na statement of Socialism that it has been kept in print ever since. But\r\nneither in Tract No. 1 nor in Tract No. 2 does the word Socialism occur,\r\nand it is not till Tract No. 3, published in June, 1885, that we find\r\nthe words \"the Fabian Society having in view the advance of Socialism in\r\nEngland.\" At this stage it is clear that the Society was socialist\r\nwithout recognising itself as part of a world-wide movement, and it was\r\nonly subsequently that it adopted the word which alone adequately\r\nexpressed its ideas.\r\n\r\nAt the second meeting, on 25th January, 1884, reports were presented on\r\na lecture by Henry George and a Conference of the Democratic Federation\r\n(later the Social Democratic Federation); the rules were adopted, and\r\nMr. J.G. Stapleton read a paper on \"Social conditions in England with a\r\nview to social reconstruction or development.\" This was the first of the\r\nlong series of Fabian fortnightly lectures which have been continued\r\never since. On February 29th, after a paper on the Democratic\r\nFederation, Mr. Bland moved: \"That whilst not entirely agreeing with the\r\nstatements and phrases used in the pamphlets of the Democratic\r\nFederation, and in the speeches of Mr. Hyndman, this Society considers\r\nthat the Democratic Federation is doing good and useful work and is\r\nworthy of sympathy and support.\" This was carried nem. con. On March 7th\r\na pamphlet committee was nominated, and on March 21st the Executive was\r\nreappointed. On April 4th the Pamphlet Committee reported, and 2000\r\ncopies of \"Fabian Tract No. 1\" were ordered to be printed.\r\n\r\nThis four-page leaflet has now remained in print for over thirty years,\r\nand there is no reason to suppose that the demand for it will soon\r\ncease. According to tradition, it was drafted by W.L. Phillips, a\r\nhouse-painter, at that time the only \"genuine working man\" in our ranks.\r\nHe had been introduced to me by a Positivist friend, and was in his way\r\na remarkable man, ready at any time to talk of his experiences of\r\nliberating slaves by the \"Underground Railway\" in the United States. He\r\nworked with us cordially for several years and then gradually dropped\r\nout. The original edition of \"Why are the many poor?\" differs very\r\nlittle from that now in circulation. It was revised some years later by\r\nBernard Shaw, who cut down the rhetoric and sharpened the phraseology,\r\nbut the substance has not been changed. It is remarkable as containing a\r\nsneer at Christianity, the only one to be found in the publications of\r\nthe Society. Perhaps this was a rebound from excess of \"subordination of\r\nmaterial things to spiritual things\" insisted on by the Fellowship of\r\nthe New Life!\r\n\r\nThe tract had on its title page two mottoes, the second of which has\r\nplayed some part in the Society's history. They were produced, again\r\naccording to tradition, by Frank Podmore, and, though printed as\r\nquotations, are not to be discovered in any history:--\r\n\r\n   \"Wherefore it may not be gainsaid that the fruit of this man's long\r\n   taking of counsel--and (by the many so deemed) untimeous delays--was\r\n   the safe-holding for all men, his fellow-citizens, of the Common\r\n   Weal.\"\r\n\r\n   \"For the right moment you must wait, as Fabius did most patiently,\r\n   when warring against Hannibal, though many censured his delays; but\r\n   when the time comes you must strike hard, as Fabius did, or your\r\n   waiting will be in vain, and fruitless.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out by Mr. H.G. Wells, and by others before him,\r\nthat Fabius never did strike hard; and many have enquired when the\r\nright time for the Fabians to strike would come. In fact, we recognised\r\nat that time that we did not know what were the remedies for the evils\r\nof society as we saw them and that the right time for striking would not\r\ncome until we knew where to strike. Taken together as the two mottoes\r\nwere first printed, this meaning is obvious. The delay was to be for the\r\npurpose of \"taking counsel.\"\r\n\r\nTract No. 1, excellent as it is, shows a sense of the evil, but gives no\r\nindication of the remedy. Its contents are commonplace, and in no sense\r\ncharacteristic of the Society. The men who were to make its reputation\r\nhad not yet found it out, and at this stage our chief characteristic was\r\na lack of self-confidence unusual amongst revolutionaries. We had with\r\nconsiderable courage set out to reconstruct society, and we frankly\r\nconfessed that we did not know how to go about it.\r\n\r\nThe next meeting to which we need refer took place on May 16th. The\r\nminutes merely record that Mr. Rowland Estcourt read a paper on \"The\r\nFigures of Mr. Mallock,\" but a pencil note in the well-known handwriting\r\nof Bernard Shaw has been subsequently added: \"This meeting was made\r\nmemorable by the first appearance of Bernard Shaw.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 5th Bernard Shaw was elected a member, and at the following\r\nmeeting on September 19th his first contribution to the literature of\r\nthe Society, Pamphlet No. 2, was read. The influence of his intellectual\r\noutlook was immediate, and already the era of \"highest moral\r\npossibilities\" seems remote. Tract No. 2 was never reprinted and the\r\nnumber of copies in existence outside public libraries is small: it is\r\ntherefore worth reproducing in full.\r\n\r\n      THE FABIAN SOCIETY\r\n\r\n   17 Osnaburgh Street, Regent's Park\r\n   Fabian Tract No. 2\r\n\r\n   A MANIFESTO\r\n\r\n   \"For always in thine eyes, O liberty,\r\n   Shines that high light whereby the world is saved;\r\n   And though thou slay us, we will trust in thee.\"\r\n\r\n   London:\r\n   George Standring, 8 & 9 Finsbury Street, E.C. 1884.\r\n\r\n   A MANIFESTO\r\n\r\n   THE FABIANS are associated for spreading the following opinions held\r\n   by them and discussing their practical consequences.\r\n\r\n   That under existing circumstances wealth cannot be enjoyed without\r\n   dishonour or foregone without misery.\r\n\r\n   That it is the duty of each member of the State to provide for his or\r\n   her wants by his or her own Labour.\r\n\r\n   That a life interest in the Land and Capital of the nation is the\r\n   birthright of every individual born within its confines and that\r\n   access to this birthright should not depend upon the will of any\r\n   private person other than the person seeking it.\r\n\r\n   That the most striking result of our present system of farming out\r\n   the national Land and Capital to private persons has been the\r\n   division of Society into hostile classes, with large appetites and no\r\n   dinners at one extreme and large dinners and no appetites at the\r\n   other.\r\n\r\n   That the practice of entrusting the Land of the nation to private\r\n   persons in the hope that they will make the best of it has been\r\n   discredited by the consistency with which they have made the worst of\r\n   it; and that Nationalisation of the Land in some form is a public\r\n   duty.\r\n\r\n   That the pretensions of Capitalism to encourage Invention and to\r\n   distribute its benefits in the fairest way attainable, have been\r\n   discredited by the experience of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n   That, under the existing system of leaving the National Industry to\r\n   organise itself Competition has the effect of rendering adulteration,\r\n   dishonest dealing and inhumanity compulsory.\r\n\r\n   That since Competition amongst producers admittedly secures to the\r\n   public the most satisfactory products, the State should compete with\r\n   all its might in every department of production.\r\n\r\n   That such restraints upon Free Competition as the penalties for\r\n   infringing the Postal monopoly, and the withdrawal of workhouse and\r\n   prison labour from the markets, should be abolished.\r\n\r\n   That no branch of Industry should be carried on at a profit by the\r\n   central administration.\r\n\r\n   That the Public Revenue should be levied by a direct Tax; and that\r\n   the central administration should have no legal power to hold back\r\n   for the replenishment of the Public Treasury any portion of the\r\n   proceeds of Industries administered by them.\r\n\r\n   That the State should compete with private individuals--especially\r\n   with parents--in providing happy homes for children, so that every\r\n   child may have a refuge from the tyranny or neglect of its natural\r\n   custodians.\r\n\r\n   That Men no longer need special political privileges to protect them\r\n   against Women, and that the sexes should henceforth enjoy equal\r\n   political rights.\r\n\r\n   That no individual should enjoy any Privilege in consideration of\r\n   services rendered to the State by his or her parents or other\r\n   relations.\r\n\r\n   That the State should secure a liberal education and an equal share\r\n   in the National Industry to each of its units.\r\n\r\n   That the established Government has no more right to call itself the\r\n   State than the smoke of London has to call itself the weather.\r\n\r\n   That we had rather face a Civil War than such another century of\r\n   suffering as the present one has been.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy in the light of thirty years' experience to write at\r\nmuch length on these propositions. They are, of course, unqualified\r\n\"Shaw.\" The minutes state that each was discussed and separately\r\nadopted. Three propositions, the nature of which is not recorded, were\r\nat a second meeting rejected, while the proposition on heredity was\r\ndrafted and inserted by order of the meeting. I recollect demurring to\r\nthe last proposition, and being assured by the author that it was all\r\nright since in fact no such alternative would ever be offered!\r\n\r\nThe persistency of Mr. Shaw's social philosophy is remarkable. His\r\nlatest volume[10] deals with parents and children, the theme he touched\r\non in 1884; his social ideal is still a birthright life interest in\r\nnational wealth, and \"an equal share in national industry,\" the latter a\r\nphrase more suggestive than lucid. On the other hand, he, like the rest\r\nof us, was then by no means clear as to the distinction between\r\nAnarchism and Socialism. The old Radical prejudice in favour of direct\r\ntaxation, so that the State may never handle a penny not wrung from the\r\nreluctant and acutely conscious taxpayer, the doctrinaire objection to\r\nState monopolies, and the modern view that municipal enterprises had\r\nbetter be carried on at cost price, are somewhat inconsistently\r\ncommingled with the advocacy of universal State competition in industry.\r\nIt may further be noticed that we were as yet unconscious of the claims\r\nand aims of the working people. Our Manifesto covered a wide field, but\r\nit nowhere touches Co-operation or Trade Unionism, wages or hours of\r\nlabour. We were still playing with abstractions, Land and Capital,\r\nIndustry and Competition, the Individual and the State.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the first tracts another point may be mentioned. The\r\nSociety has stuck to the format adopted in these early days, and with a\r\nfew special exceptions all its publications have been issued in the same\r\nstyle, and with numbers running on consecutively. For all sorts of\r\npurposes the advantage of this continuity has been great.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn January 2nd, 1885, Bernard Shaw was elected to the Executive\r\nCommittee, and about the same time references to the Industrial\r\nRemuneration Conference appear in the minutes. This remarkable\r\ngathering, made possible by a gift of £1000 from Mr. Miller of\r\nEdinburgh, was summoned to spend three days in discussing the question,\r\n\"Has the increase of products of industry within the last hundred years\r\ntended most to the benefit of capitalists and employers or to that of\r\nthe working classes, whether artisans, labourers or others? And in what\r\nrelative proportions in any given period?\"\r\n\r\nThe second day was devoted to \"Remedies,\" and the third to the\r\nquestion, \"Would the more general distribution of capital or land or the\r\nState management of capital or land promote or impair the production of\r\nwealth and the welfare of the community?\" The Fabian Society appointed\r\ntwo delegates, J.G. Stapleton and Hubert Bland, but Bernard Shaw\r\napparently took the place of the latter.\r\n\r\nIt met on January 28th, at the Prince's Hall, Piccadilly. Mr. Arthur J.\r\nBalfour read a paper in which he made an observation worth recording:\r\n\"As will be readily believed, I am no Socialist, but to compare the work\r\nof such men as Mr. (Henry) George with that of such men, for instance,\r\nas Karl Marx, either in respect of its intellectual force, its\r\nconsistency, its command of reasoning in general, or of economic\r\nreasoning in particular, seems to me absurd.\"\r\n\r\nThe Conference was the first occasion in which the Fabian Society\r\nemerged from its drawing-room obscurity, and the speech of Bernard Shaw\r\non the third day was probably the first he delivered before an audience\r\nof more than local importance. One passage made an impression on his\r\nfriends and probably on the public. \"It was,\" he said, \"the desire of\r\nthe President that nothing should be said that might give pain to\r\nparticular classes. He was about to refer to a modern class, the\r\nburglars, but if there was a burglar present he begged him to believe\r\nthat he cast no reflection upon his profession, and that he was not\r\nunmindful of his great skill and enterprise: his risks--so much greater\r\nthan those of the most speculative capitalist, extending as they did to\r\nrisk of liberty and life--his abstinence; or finally of the great number\r\nof people to whom he gave employment, including criminal attorneys,\r\npolicemen, turnkeys, builders of gaols, and it might be the hangman. He\r\ndid not wish to hurt the feelings of shareholders ... or of landlords\r\n... any more than he wished to pain burglars. He would merely point out\r\nthat all three inflicted on the community an injury of precisely the\r\nsame nature.\"[11]\r\n\r\nIt may be added that Mr. Shaw was patted on the back by a subsequent\r\nspeaker, Mr. John Wilson, of the Durham Miners, for many years M.P. for\r\nMid-Durham, and by no means an habitual supporter of Socialists.\r\n\r\nThe stout volume in which the proceedings are published is now but\r\nseldom referred to, but it is a somewhat significant record of the\r\nintellectual unrest of the period, an indication that the governing\r\nclasses even at this early date in the history of English Socialism,\r\nwere prepared to consider its claims, and to give its proposals a\r\nrespectful hearing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe early debates in the Society were in the main on things abstract or\r\nUtopian. Social Reconstruction was a constant theme, Hubert Bland\r\noutlined \"Revolutionary Prospects\" in January, 1885, and Bernard Shaw in\r\nFebruary combated \"The proposed Abolition of the Currency.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 6th a new departure began: a Committee was appointed to collect\r\n\"facts concerning the working of the Poor Law,\" with special reference\r\nto alleged official attempts to disprove \"great distress amongst the\r\nworkers.\" It does not appear that the Report was ever completed.\r\n\r\nOn March 20th Sidney Webb read a paper on \"The Way Out,\" and on the 1st\r\nMay he was elected a member along with his Colonial Office colleague\r\nSydney Olivier. On May 15th is recorded the election of Harold Cox,\r\nsubsequently M.P., and now editor of the \"Edinburgh Review.\"\r\n\r\nThe Society was now finding its feet. On April 17th it had been\r\nresolved to send a delegate \"to examine into and report upon the South\r\nYorkshire Miners\"! And on the same day it was determined to get up a\r\nSoirée. This gathering, held in Gower Street, was memorable because it\r\nwas attended by Mrs. Annie Besant, then notorious as an advocate of\r\nAtheism and Malthusianism, the heroine of several famous law cases, and\r\na friend and colleague of Charles Bradlaugh. Mrs. Besant was elected a\r\nmember a few weeks later, and she completed the list of the seven who\r\nsubsequently wrote \"Fabian Essays,\" with the exception of Graham Wallas,\r\nwho did not join the Society until April, 1886.[12]\r\n\r\nBut although Sidney Webb had become a Fabian the scientific spirit was\r\nnot yet predominant. Bernard Shaw had, then as now, a strong objection\r\nto the peasant agriculture of his native land, and he submitted to the\r\nSociety a characteristic leaflet addressed: \"To provident Landlords and\r\nCapitalists, a suggestion and a warning.\" \"The Fabian Society,\" it says,\r\n\"having in view the advance of Socialism and the threatened subversion\r\nof the powers hitherto exercised by private proprietors of the national\r\nland and capital ventures plainly to warn all such proprietors that the\r\nestablishment of Socialism in England means nothing less than the\r\ncompulsion of all members of the upper class, without regard to sex or\r\ncondition, to work for their own living.\" The tract, which is a very\r\nbrief one, goes on to recommend the proprietary classes to \"support all\r\nundertakings having for their object the parcelling out of waste or\r\ninferior lands amongst the labouring class\" for sundry plausible\r\nreasons. At the foot of the title page, in the smallest of type, is the\r\nfollowing: \"Note.--Great care should be taken to keep this tract out of\r\nthe hands of radical workmen, Socialist demagogues and the like, as they\r\nare but too apt to conclude that schemes favourable to landlords cannot\r\nbe permanently advantageous to the working class.\" This elaborate joke\r\nwas, except for one amendment, adopted as drafted on June 5th, 1885, and\r\nthere is a tradition that it was favourably reviewed by a Conservative\r\nnewspaper!\r\n\r\nThe Society still met as a rule at 17 Osnaburgh Street, or in the rooms\r\nof Frank Podmore at 14 Dean's Yard, Westminster, but it was steadily\r\ngrowing and new members were elected at every meeting. Although most of\r\nthe members were young men of university education, the Society included\r\npeople of various ages. To us at any rate Mrs. James Hinton, widow of\r\nDr. Hinton, and her sisters, Miss Haddon and Miss Caroline Haddon,\r\nseemed to be at least elderly. Mrs. Robins, her husband (a successful\r\narchitect), and her daughter, who acted as \"assistant\" honorary\r\nsecretary for the first eighteen months, lent an air of prosperous\r\nrespectability to our earliest meetings. Mr. and Mrs. J. Glode\r\nStapleton, who were prominent members for some years, were remarkable\r\namongst us because they drove to our meetings in their own brougham! The\r\nworking classes, as before mentioned, had but a single representative.\r\nAnother prominent member at this period was Mrs. Charlotte M. Wilson,\r\nwife of a stock-broker living in Hampstead, who a short time later\r\n\"simplified\" into a cottage at the end of the Heath, called Wildwood\r\nFarm, now a part of the Garden Suburb Estate, where Fabians for many\r\nyears held the most delightful of their social gatherings. Mrs. Wilson\r\nwas elected to the Executive of five in December, 1884 (Mrs. Wilson, H.\r\nBland, E.R. Pease, G. Bernard Shaw and F. Keddell), but after some time\r\ndevoted herself entirely to the Anarchist movement, led by Prince\r\nKropotkin, and for some years edited their paper, \"Freedom.\" But she\r\nremained throughout a member of the Fabian Society, and twenty years\r\nlater she resumed her Fabian activity, as will be related in a later\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nAll this time the Socialist movement in England was coming into public\r\nnotice with startling rapidity. In January, 1884, \"Justice, the organ of\r\nthe Democratic Federation,\" was founded, and in August of that year the\r\nFederation made the first of its many changes of name, and became the\r\nSocial Democratic Federation or S.D.F. The public then believed, as the\r\nSocialists also necessarily believed, that Socialism would be so\r\nattractive to working-class electors that they would follow its banner\r\nas soon as it was raised, and the candidatures undertaken by the S.D.F.\r\nat the General Election in November, 1885, produced widespread alarm\r\namongst politicians of both parties. The following account of this\r\nepisode from Fabian Tract 41, \"The Early History of the Fabian Society,\"\r\nwas written by Bernard Shaw in 1892, and describes the events and our\r\nattitude at the time far more freshly and graphically than anything I\r\ncan write nearly thirty years later.\r\n\r\nAfter explaining why he preferred joining the Fabian Society rather than\r\nthe S.D.F., Mr. Shaw goes on (pp. 4-7):--\r\n\r\n   \"However, as I have said, in 1885 our differences [from other\r\n   Socialists] were latent or instinctive; and we denounced the\r\n   capitalists as thieves at the Industrial Remuneration Conference,\r\n   and, among ourselves, talked revolution, anarchism, labour notes\r\n   _versus_ pass-books, and all the rest of it, on the tacit assumption\r\n   that the object of our campaign, with its watchwords, 'EDUCATE,\r\n   AGITATE, ORGANIZE,' was to bring about a tremendous smash-up of\r\n   existing society, to be succeeded by complete Socialism. And this\r\n   meant that we had no true practical understanding either of existing\r\n   society or Socialism. Without being quite definitely aware of this,\r\n   we yet felt it to a certain extent all along; for it was at this\r\n   period that we contracted the invaluable habit of freely laughing at\r\n   ourselves which has always distinguished us, and which has saved us\r\n   from becoming hampered by the gushing enthusiasts who mistake their\r\n   own emotions for public movements. From the first, such people fled\r\n   after one glance at us, declaring that we were not serious. Our\r\n   preference for practical suggestions and criticisms, and our\r\n   impatience of all general expressions of sympathy with working-class\r\n   aspirations, not to mention our way of chaffing our opponents in\r\n   preference to denouncing them as enemies of the human race, repelled\r\n   from us some warm-hearted and eloquent Socialists, to whom it seemed\r\n   callous and cynical to be even commonly self-possessed in the\r\n   presence of the sufferings upon which Socialists make war. But there\r\n   was far too much equality and personal intimacy among the Fabians to\r\n   allow of any member presuming to get up and preach at the rest in the\r\n   fashion which the working-classes still tolerate submissively from\r\n   their leaders. We knew that a certain sort of oratory was useful for\r\n   'stoking up' public meetings; but we needed no stoking up, and, when\r\n   any orator tried the process on us, soon made him understand that he\r\n   was wasting his time and ours. I, for one, should be very sorry to\r\n   lower the intellectual standard of the Fabian by making the\r\n   atmosphere of its public discussions the least bit more congenial to\r\n   stale declamation than it is at present. If our debates are to be\r\n   kept wholesome, they cannot be too irreverent or too critical. And\r\n   the irreverence, which has become traditional with us, comes down\r\n   from those early days when we often talked such nonsense that we\r\n   could not help laughing at ourselves.\r\n\r\n   \"TORY GOLD AT THE 1885 ELECTION.\r\n\r\n   \"When I add that in 1885 we had only 40 members, you will be able to\r\n   form a sufficient notion of the Fabian Society in its nonage. In that\r\n   year there occurred an event which developed the latent differences\r\n   between ourselves and the Social-Democratic Federation. The\r\n   Federation said then, as it still says, that its policy is founded on\r\n   a recognition of the existence of a Class War. How far the fact of\r\n   the working classes being at war with the proprietary classes\r\n   justifies them in suspending the observance of the ordinary social\r\n   obligations in dealing with them was never settled; but at that time\r\n   we were decidedly less scrupulous than we are now in our ideas on the\r\n   subject; and we all said freely that as gunpowder destroyed the\r\n   feudal system, so the capitalist system could not long survive the\r\n   invention of dynamite. Not that we are dynamitards: indeed the\r\n   absurdity of the inference shows how innocent we were of any\r\n   practical acquaintance with explosives; but we thought that the\r\n   statement about gunpowder and feudalism was historically true, and\r\n   that it would do the capitalists good to remind them of it. Suddenly,\r\n   however, the Federation made a very startling practical application\r\n   of the Class War doctrine. They did not blow anybody up; but in the\r\n   general election of 1885 they ran two candidates in London--Mr.\r\n   Williams, in Hampstead, who got 27 votes, and Mr. Fielding, in\r\n   Kennington, who got 32 votes. And they made no secret of the fact\r\n   that the expenses of these elections had been paid by one of the\r\n   established political parties in order to split the vote of the\r\n   other. From the point of view of the abstract moralist there was\r\n   nothing to be said against the transaction; since it was evident that\r\n   Socialist statesmanship must for a long time to come consist largely\r\n   of taking advantage of the party dissensions between the\r\n   Unsocialists. It may easily happen to-morrow that the Liberal party\r\n   may offer to contribute to the expenses of a Fabian candidate in a\r\n   hopelessly Tory stronghold, in order to substantiate its pretensions\r\n   to encourage Labour representation. Under such circumstances it is\r\n   quite possible that we may say to the Fabian in question, Accept by\r\n   all means; and deliver propagandist addresses all over the place.\r\n   Suppose that the Liberal party offers to bear part of Mr. Sidney\r\n   Webb's expenses at the forthcoming County Council election at\r\n   Deptford, as they undoubtedly will, by means of the usual National\r\n   Liberal Club subscription, in the case of the poorer Labour\r\n   candidates. Mr. Webb, as a matter of personal preference for an\r\n   independence which he is fortunately able to afford, will refuse. But\r\n   suppose Mr. Webb were not in that fortunate position, as some Labour\r\n   candidates will not be! It is quite certain that not the smallest\r\n   odium would attach to the acceptance of a Liberal grant-in-aid. Now\r\n   the idea that taking Tory money is worse than taking Liberal money is\r\n   clearly a Liberal party idea and not a Social-Democratic one. In 1885\r\n   there was not the slightest excuse for regarding the Tory party as\r\n   any more hostile to Socialism than the Liberal party; and Mr.\r\n   Hyndman's classical quotation, _'Non olet'_--'It does not smell,'\r\n   meaning that there is no difference in the flavour of Tory and Whig\r\n   gold once it comes into the Socialist treasury, was a sufficient\r\n   retort to the accusations of moral corruption which were levelled at\r\n   him. But the Tory money job, as it was called, was none the less a\r\n   huge mistake in tactics. Before it took place, the Federation loomed\r\n   large in the imagination of the public and the political parties.\r\n   This is conclusively proved by the fact that the Tories thought that\r\n   the Socialists could take enough votes from the Liberals to make it\r\n   worth while to pay the expenses of two Socialist candidates in\r\n   London. The day after the election everyone knew that the Socialists\r\n   were an absolutely negligeable quantity there as far as voting power\r\n   was concerned. They had presented the Tory party with 57 votes, at a\r\n   cost of about £8 apiece. What was worse, they had shocked London\r\n   Radicalism, to which Tory money was an utter abomination. It is hard\r\n   to say which cut the more foolish figure, the Tories who had spent\r\n   their money for nothing, or the Socialists who had sacrificed their\r\n   reputation for worse than nothing.\r\n\r\n   \"The disaster was so obvious that there was an immediate falling off\r\n   from the Federation, on the one hand of the sane tacticians of the\r\n   movement, and on the other of those out-and-out Insurrectionists who\r\n   repudiated political action altogether, and were only too glad to be\r\n   able to point to a discreditable instance of it. Two resolutions were\r\n   passed, one by the Socialist League and the other by the Fabian\r\n   Society. Here is the Fabian resolution:\r\n\r\n   \"'That the conduct of the Council of the Social-Democratic Federation\r\n   in accepting money from the Tory party in payment of the election\r\n   expenses of Socialist candidates is calculated to disgrace the\r\n   Socialist movement in England,'--4th Dec., 1885.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of this resolution, passed by 15 votes to 4, was the first of\r\nthe very few splits which are recorded in the history of the Society.\r\nFrederick Keddell, the first honorary secretary, resigned and I took his\r\nplace, whilst a few weeks later Sidney Webb was elected to the vacancy\r\non the Executive.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 Socialism was prominently before the public. Unemployment\r\nreached a height which has never since been touched. Messrs. Hyndman,\r\nChampion, Burns, and Williams were actually tried for sedition, but\r\nhappily acquitted; and public opinion was justified in regarding\r\nSocialism rather as destructive and disorderly than as constructive,\r\nand, as is now often said, even too favourable to repressive\r\nlegislation. In these commotions the Society as a whole took no part,\r\nand its public activities were limited to a meeting at South Place\r\nChapel, on December 18th, 1885, addressed by Mrs. Besant.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1886, the Executive Committee was increased to seven by the\r\naddition of Mrs. Besant and Frank Podmore, and in April Tract No. 4,\r\n\"What Socialism Is,\" was approved for publication. It begins with a\r\nhistorical preface, touching on the Wars of the Roses, Tudor\r\nconfiscation of land, the enclosure of commons, the Industrial\r\nRevolution, and so on. Surplus value and the tendency of wages to a\r\nminimum are mentioned, and the valuable work of Trade\r\nUnionism--sometimes regarded by Guild Socialists and others nowadays as\r\na recent discovery--is alluded to: indeed the modern syndicalist\r\ndoctrine was anticipated: the workman, it is said, \"has been forced to\r\nsell himself for a mess of pottage and is consequently deprived of the\r\nguidance of his own life and the direction of his own labour.\" Socialist\r\nopinion abroad, it says, \"has taken shape in two distinct schools,\r\nCollectivist and Anarchist. English Socialism is not yet Anarchist or\r\nCollectivist, not yet definite enough in point of policy to be\r\nclassified. There is a mass of Socialist feeling not yet conscious of\r\nitself as Socialism. But when the conscious Socialists of England\r\ndiscover their position they also will probably fall into two parties: a\r\nCollectivist party supporting a strong central administration, and a\r\ncounterbalancing Anarchist party defending individual initiative against\r\nthat administration. In some such fashion progress and stability will\r\nprobably be secured under Socialism by the conflict of the uneradicable\r\nTory and Whig instincts in human nature.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that even in this period of turmoil the Society was\r\naltogether constitutional in its outlook; political parties of\r\nSocialists and Anarchists combining progress with stability were the\r\nfeatures of the future we foresaw.\r\n\r\nBy this time the Society was thoroughly aware of its relation to\r\ninternational socialism, and the remaining six pages of the tract are\r\noccupied by expositions of the alternatives above alluded to.\r\n\"Collectivism\" is summarised from Bebel's \"Woman in the Past, Present,\r\nand Future,\" and is a somewhat mechanical scheme of executive committees\r\nin each local commune or district representing each branch of industry,\r\nelected by universal suffrage for brief periods of office and paid at\r\nthe rate of ordinary workmen; and of a central Executive Committee\r\nchosen in like manner or else directly appointed by the local Communal\r\nCouncils. The second part consists of \"Anarchism, drawn up by C.M.\r\nWilson on behalf of the London Anarchists.\" This is a statement of\r\nabstract principles which frankly admits that \"Anarchists have no fears\r\nthat in discarding the Collectivist dream of the scientific regulation\r\nof industry and inventing no formulas for social conditions as yet\r\nunrealised, they are neglecting the essential for the visionary,\"\r\n\r\nThis tract was never reprinted, and, of course, it attracted no\r\nattention. It was however the first of the long series of Fabian tracts\r\nthat aimed at supplying information and thus carrying out the original\r\nobject of the Society, the education of its members and the systematic\r\nstudy of the reconstruction of the social system.\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1886 was occupied with arrangements for the Conference,\r\nwhich was held at South Place Chapel on June 9th, 10th, and 11th.\r\n\r\nHere again a quotation from Bernard Shaw's \"Early History of the Fabian\r\nSociety\" is the best description available:--\r\n\r\n   \"THE FABIAN CONFERENCE OF 1886.\r\n\r\n   \"You will now ask to be told what the Fabians had been doing all this\r\n   time. Well, I think it must be admitted that we were overlooked in\r\n   the excitements of the unemployed agitation, which had, moreover,\r\n   caused the Tory money affair to be forgotten. The Fabians were\r\n   disgracefully backward in open-air speaking. Up to quite a recent\r\n   date, Graham Wallas, myself, and Mrs. Besant were the only\r\n   representative open-air speakers in the Society, whereas the\r\n   Federation speakers, Burns, Hyndman, Andrew Hall, Tom Mann, Champion,\r\n   Burrows, with the Socialist Leaguers, were at it constantly. On the\r\n   whole, the Church Parades and the rest were not in our line; and we\r\n   were not wanted by the men who were organizing them. Our only\r\n   contribution to the agitation was a report which we printed in 1886,\r\n   which recommended experiments in tobacco culture, and even hinted at\r\n   compulsory military service, as means of absorbing some of the\r\n   unskilled unemployed, but which went carefully into the practical\r\n   conditions of relief works. Indeed, we are at present trying to\r\n   produce a new tract on the subject without finding ourselves able to\r\n   improve very materially on the old one in this respect. It was drawn\r\n   up by Bland, Hughes, Podmore, Stapleton, and Webb, and was the first\r\n   of our publications that contained any solid information. Its tone,\r\n   however, was moderate and its style somewhat conventional; and the\r\n   Society was still in so hot a temper on the social question that we\r\n   refused to adopt it as a regular Fabian tract, and only issued it as\r\n   a report printed for the information of members. Nevertheless we were\r\n   coming to our senses rapidly by this time. We signalized our\r\n   repudiation of political sectarianism in June, 1886, by inviting the\r\n   Radicals, the Secularists, and anyone else who would come, to a great\r\n   conference, modelled upon the Industrial Remuneration Conference, and\r\n   dealing with the Nationalization of Land and Capital. It fully\r\n   established the fact that we had nothing immediately practical to\r\n   impart to the Radicals and that they had nothing to impart to us.\r\n   The proceedings were fully reported for us; but we never had the\r\n   courage even to read the shorthand writer's report, which still\r\n   remains in MS. Before I refreshed my memory on the subject the other\r\n   day, I had a vague notion that the Conference cost a great deal of\r\n   money; that it did no good whatever; that Mr. Bradlaugh made a\r\n   speech; that Mrs. Fenwick Miller, who had nothing on earth to do with\r\n   us, was in the chair during part of the proceedings; and that the\r\n   most successful paper was by a strange gentleman whom we had taken on\r\n   trust as a Socialist, but who turned out to be an enthusiast on the\r\n   subject of building more harbours. I find, however, on looking up the\r\n   facts, that no less than fifty-three societies sent delegates; that\r\n   the guarantee fund for expenses was £100; and that the discussions\r\n   were kept going for three afternoons and three evenings. The\r\n   Federation boycotted us; but the 'Times' reported us.[13] Eighteen\r\n   papers were read, two of them by members of Parliament, and most of\r\n   the rest by well-known people. William Morris and Dr. Aveling read\r\n   papers as delegates from the Socialist League; the National Secular\r\n   Society sent Mr. Foote and Mr. [John M.] Robertson,[14] the latter\r\n   contributing a 'Scheme of Taxation' in which he anticipated much of\r\n   what was subsequently adopted as the Fabian program; Wordsworth\r\n   Donisthorpe took the field for Anarchism of the type advocated by the\r\n   authors of 'A Plea for Liberty'; Stewart Headlam spoke for Christian\r\n   Socialism and the Guild of St. Matthew; Dr. Pankhurst dealt with the\r\n   situation from the earlier Radical point of view; and various\r\n   Socialist papers were read by Mrs. Besant, Sidney Webb, and Edward\r\n   Carpenter, besides one by Stuart Glennie, who subsequently left us\r\n   because we fought shy of the Marriage Question when revising our\r\n   'Basis.' I mention all this in order to show you how much more\r\n   important this abortive Conference looked than the present one. Yet\r\n   all that can be said for it is that it made us known to the Radical\r\n   clubs and proved that we were able to manage a conference in a\r\n   businesslike way. It also, by the way, showed off our pretty\r\n   prospectus with the design by Crane at the top, our stylish-looking\r\n   blood-red invitation cards, and the other little smartnesses on which\r\n   we then prided ourselves. We used to be plentifully sneered at as\r\n   fops and arm-chair Socialists for our attention to these details; but\r\n   I think it was by no means the least of our merits that we always, as\r\n   far as our means permitted, tried to make our printed documents as\r\n   handsome as possible, and did our best to destroy the association\r\n   between revolutionary literature and slovenly printing on paper that\r\n   is nasty without being cheap. One effect of this was that we were\r\n   supposed to be much richer than we really were, because we generally\r\n   got better value and a finer show for our money than the other\r\n   Socialist societies.\"[15]\r\n\r\nThree members of Parliament, Charles Bradlaugh, William Saunders, and\r\nDr. G.B. Clark, took part. The Dr. Pankhurst mentioned was the husband\r\nof Mrs. Pankhurst, later the leader of the Women's Social and Political\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThe reference in the foregoing passage to the report on \"The Government\r\nOrganisation of Unemployed Labour,\" prepared concurrently with the\r\norganisation of the Conference, is by no means adequate. The Report\r\nattracted but little attention at the time, even in the Society itself,\r\nbut it is in fact the first typically Fabian publication, and the first\r\nin which Sidney Webb took part. Much subsequent experience has convinced\r\nme that whenever Webb is on a committee it may be assumed in default of\r\npositive evidence to the contrary that its report is his work. Webb\r\nhowever maintains that to the best of his recollection the work was\r\nshared between Podmore and himself, the simple arrangement being that\r\nPodmore wrote the first half and Webb the second. The tract is an\r\nattempt to deal with a pressing social problem on constructive lines. It\r\nsurveys the field, analyses the phenomena presented, and suggests\r\npracticable remedies. It is however a very cautious document. Webb was\r\nthen old as an economist, and very young as a Socialist; none of the\r\nrest of the Committee had the knowledge, if they had the will, to stand\r\nup to him. Therefore we find snippets from the theory of economic\r\n\"balance\" which was universally regarded as valid in those days.\r\n\r\n\"In practice the government obtains its technical skill by attracting\r\nmen from other employers, and its capital in a mobile form by attracting\r\nit from other possessors. It gets loans on the money market, which is\r\nthereby rendered more stringent; the rate of interest rises and the\r\nloans made to other borrowers are diminished,\"\r\n\r\nBut the particular interest of the Report at the present day is the fact\r\nthat it contains the germs of many ideas which more than twenty years\r\nlater formed the leading features of the Minority Report of the Poor Law\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nAt that time it was universally believed that the slum dwellers of\r\nLondon were mainly recruited by rural immigrants, and this\r\nerror--disproved several years later by the painstaking statistical\r\ninvestigations of Mr. (now Sir) H. Llewelyn Smith--vitiates much of the\r\nreasoning of the Report.\r\n\r\nAfter analysing the causes of unemployment on lines now familiar to all,\r\nand denouncing private charity with vehemence worthy of the Charity\r\nOrganisation Society, it recommends the revival of social life in our\r\nvillages in order to keep the country people from crowding into the\r\nslums. The Dock Companies are urged to organise their casual labour into\r\npermanently employed brigades: and it is suggested, as in the \"Minority\r\nReport,\" that \"the most really 'remunerative' form of 'relief' works for\r\nthe unemployed would often be a course of instruction in some new trade\r\nor handicraft\" Technical education is strongly recommended; Labour\r\nBureaux are advocated; State cultivation of tobacco is suggested as a\r\nmeans of employing labour on the land (private cultivation of tobacco\r\nwas until recently prohibited by law), as well as municipal drink\r\nsupply, State railways, and \"universal military (home) service\" as a\r\nmeans of promoting \"the growth of social consciousness,\"\r\n\r\nThe Report is unequal. An eloquent but irrelevant passage on the social\r\neffects of bringing the railway contractor's navvies to a rural village\r\nwas possibly contributed by Hubert Bland, whilst the conclusion, a\r\nmagniloquent eulogy of the moral value of Government service, written,\r\naccording to Webb's recollection, by Frank Podmore, is evidently the\r\nwork of a civil servant who has not got over the untamed enthusiasms of\r\nyouth!\r\n\r\nThe Report shows immature judgment, but also in parts remarkable\r\nforesight, and a complete realisation of the right scientific method.\r\nWith State tobacco farms and the public organisation of a corps of\r\nperipatetic State navvies, the childhood stage of the Fabian Society\r\nmay be said to conclude.\r\n\r\nMy own connection with the Society also changed. In the spring of 1886 I\r\ngave up my business on the Stock Exchange and in the summer went to\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, where I lived till the autumn of 1890. My account of\r\nthe Society for the next three years is therefore in the main derived\r\nfrom its records. Sydney Olivier succeeded me as \"Acting Secretary,\" but\r\nfor some months I was still nominally the secretary, a fact of much\r\nsignificance to my future, since it enabled me if I liked to deal with\r\ncorrespondence, and it was through a letter to the secretary of the\r\nSociety, answered by me from Newcastle, that I made the acquaintance of\r\nthe lady who three years later became my wife.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] \"Misalliance: with a treatise on parents and children,\" 1914.\r\n\r\n[11] Industrial Remuneration Conference. The Report, etc. Cassell, 1885,\r\np. 400.\r\n\r\n[12] William Clarke had attended some early meetings but dropped out and\r\nwas actually elected to the Society in February, 1886.\r\n\r\n[13] Presumably a \"Times\" reporter was present; but his report was not\r\npublished.\r\n\r\n[14] Later M.P. for Tyneside and a member of Mr. Asquith's Government.\r\n\r\n[15] Contemporary accounts of the conference can be found in the July\r\nnumbers of \"To-day\" and \"The Republican,\" the former by Mrs. Besant, and\r\nthe latter, a descriptive criticism, by the Editor and Printer, George\r\nStandring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\nThe Formation of Fabian Policy: 1886-9\r\n\r\n   The factors of success; priority of date; the men who made it--The\r\n   controversy over policy--The Fabian Parliamentary League--\"Facts for\r\n   Socialists\"--The adoption of the Basis--The seven Essayists in\r\n   command--Lord Haldane--The \"Essays\" as lectures--How to train for\r\n   Public Life--Fabians on the London School Board--\"Facts for\r\n   Londoners\"--Municipal Socialism--\"The Eight Hours Bill\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Society was now fully constituted, and for the next three years its\r\ndestiny was controlled by the seven who subsequently wrote \"Fabian\r\nEssays.\" But it was still a very small and quite obscure body. Mrs.\r\nBesant, alone of its leaders, was known beyond its circle, and at that\r\nperiod few outside the working classes regarded her with respect. The\r\nSociety still met, as a rule, at the house of one or other of the\r\nmembers, and to the founders, who numbered about 20, only about 67\r\nmembers had been added by June, 1886. The receipts for the year to\r\nMarch, 1886, were no More than £35 19s., but as the expenditure only\r\namounted to £27 6s. 6d., the Society had already adopted its lifelong\r\nhabit of paying its way punctually, though it must be confessed that a\r\ncomplaisant printer and a series of lucky windfalls have contributed to\r\nthat result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Elliott and Fry, W._\r\n\r\nSYDNEY OLIVIER, IN 1903]\r\n\r\nThe future success of the Society was dependent in the main on two\r\nfactors then already in existence. The first was its foundation before\r\nthere was any other definitely Socialist body in England. The Social\r\nDemocratic Federation did not adopt that name until August, 1884; the\r\nFabian Society can therefore claim technical priority, and consequently\r\nit has never had to seek acceptance by the rest of the Socialist\r\nmovement. At any later date it would have been impossible for a\r\nrelatively small middle-class society to obtain recognition as an\r\nacknowledged member of the Socialist confraternity. We were thus in a\r\nposition to welcome the formation of working-class Socialist societies,\r\nbut it is certain that in the early days they would never have welcomed\r\nus.\r\n\r\nRegret has been sometimes expressed, chiefly by foreign observers, that\r\nthe Society has maintained its separate identity. Why, it has been\r\nasked, did not the middle-class leaders of the Society devote their\r\nabilities directly to aiding the popular organisations, instead of\r\n\"keeping themselves to themselves\" like ultra-respectable suburbans?\r\n\r\nIf this had been possible I am convinced that the loss would have\r\nexceeded the gain, but in the early years it was not possible. The\r\nSocial Democrats of those days asserted that unquestioning belief in\r\nevery dogma attributed to Marx was essential to social salvation, and\r\nthat its only way was revolution, by which they meant, not the complete\r\ntransformation of society, but its transformation by means of rifles and\r\nbarricades; they were convinced that a successful repetition of the\r\nCommune of Paris was the only method by which their policy could\r\nprevail. The Fabians realised from the first that no such revolution was\r\nlikely to take place, and that constant talk about it was the worst\r\npossible way to commend Socialism to the British working class. And\r\nindeed a few years later it was necessary to establish a new\r\nworking-class Socialist Society, the Independent Labour Party, in order\r\nto get clear both of the tradition of revolutionary violence and of the\r\nvain repetition of Marxian formulas. If the smaller society had merged\r\nitself in the popular movement, its criticism, necessary, as it proved\r\nto be, to the success of Socialism in England, would have been voted\r\ndown, and its critics either silenced or expelled. Of this criticism I\r\nshall have more to say in another place.[16]\r\n\r\nBut there was another reason why this course would have been\r\nimpracticable. The Fabians were not suited either by ability,\r\ntemperament, or conditions to be leaders of a popular revolutionary\r\nparty. Mrs. Besant with her gift of splendid oratory and her long\r\nexperience of agitation was an exception, but her connection with the\r\nmovement lasted no more than five years. Of the others Shaw did not and\r\ndoes not now possess that unquestioning faith in recognised principles\r\nwhich is the stock-in-trade of political leadership:[17] and whilst Webb\r\nmight have been a first-class minister at the head of a department, his\r\nabilities would have been wasted as a leader in a minority. But there\r\nwas a more practical bar. The Fabians were mostly civil servants or\r\nclerks in private employ. The methods of agitation congenial to them\r\nwere compatible with their occupations: those of the Social Democrats\r\nwere not. Indeed in those days no question of amalgamation was ever\r\nmooted.\r\n\r\nBut it must be remembered by critics that so far as concerns the Fabian\r\nSociety, the absence of identity in organisation has never led to such\r\nhostility as has been common amongst Continental Socialists. Since the\r\nvote of censure in relation to the \"Tory Gold,\" the Fabian Society has\r\nnever interfered with the doings of its friendly rivals. The two\r\nSocieties have occasionally co-operated, but as a rule they have\r\nseverally carried on their own work, each recognising the value of many\r\nof the activities of the other, and on the whole confining mutual\r\ncriticism within reasonable limits.\r\n\r\nThe second and chief reason for the success of the Society was its good\r\nfortune in attaching to its service a group of young men, then\r\naltogether unknown, whose reputation has gradually spread, in two or\r\nthree cases, all over the world, and who have always been in the main\r\nidentified with Fabianism. Very rarely in the history of voluntary\r\norganisations has a group of such exceptional people come together\r\nalmost accidentally and worked unitedly together for so many years for\r\nthe furtherance of the principles in which they believed. Others have\r\nassisted according to their abilities and opportunities, but to the\r\nFabian Essayists belongs the credit of creating the Fabian Society.\r\n\r\nFor several years, and those perhaps the most important in the history\r\nof the Society, the period, in fact, of adolescence, the Society was\r\ngoverned by the seven Essayists, and chiefly by four or five of them.\r\nMrs. Besant had made her reputation in other fields, and belonged, in a\r\nsense, to an earlier generation; she was unrivalled as an expositor and\r\nan agitator, and naturally preferred the work that she did best. William\r\nClarke, also, was just a little of an outsider: he attended committees\r\nirregularly, and although he did what he was persuaded to do with\r\nremarkable force--he was an admirable lecturer and an efficient\r\njournalist--he had no initiative. He was solitary in his habits, and in\r\nhis latter years, overshadowed by ill-health, he became almost morose.\r\nHubert Bland, again, was always something of a critic. He was a Tory by\r\ninstinct wherever he was not a Socialist, and whilst thoroughly united\r\nwith the others for all purposes of the Society, he lived the rest of\r\nhis life apart. But the other four Essayists, Sidney Webb, Bernard Shaw,\r\nGraham Wallas, and Sydney Olivier, then and for many years afterwards\r\nmay be said to have worked and thought together in an intellectual\r\npartnership.[18] Webb and Olivier were colleagues in the Colonial\r\nOffice, and it is said that for some time the Fabian records--they were\r\nnot very bulky--were stored on a table in Downing Street. For many years\r\nthere were probably few evenings of the week and few holidays which two\r\nor more of them did not spend together.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 or early in 1886 a group which included those four and many\r\nothers formed a reading society for the discussion of Marx's \"Capital.\"\r\nThe meetings--I attended them until I left London--were held in\r\nHampstead, sometimes at the house of Mrs. Gilchrist, widow of the\r\nbiographer of Blake, sometimes at that of Mrs. C.M. Wilson, and finally\r\nat the Hampstead Public Library. Later on the Society was called \"The\r\nHampstead Historic,\" and its discussions, which continued for several\r\nyears, had much to do with settling the Fabian attitude towards Marxian\r\neconomics and historical theory.[19]\r\n\r\nIt was this exceptional group of leaders, all intimate friends, all\r\nloyal to each other, and to the cause they were associated to advocate,\r\nand all far above the average in vigour and ability, that in a few years\r\nturned an obscure drawing-room society into a factor in national\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the meeting on June 19th, 1886, at 94 Cornwall Gardens, Sydney\r\nOlivier assumed the duties of Secretary, and the minutes began to be\r\nwritten with less formality than before. It is recorded that \"Graham\r\nWallas read a paper on Personal Duty under the present system. A number\r\nof questions from Fabians more or less in trouble about their souls were\r\nanswered _ex cathedra_ by Mr. Wallas, after which the Society was given\r\nto understand by G.B. Shaw that Joseph the Fifth Monarchy Man could show\r\nthem a more excellent way. Joseph addressed the meeting for five\r\nminutes, on the subject of a community about to be established in\r\nBritish North America under the presidency of the Son of God. Sidney\r\nWebb, G. Bernard Shaw, Annie Besant, [the Rev.] C.L. Marson and Adolph\r\nSmith discussed the subject of the paper with especial reference to the\r\nquestion of buying cheap goods and of the employment of the surplus\r\nincome of pensioners, after which Graham Wallas replied and the meeting\r\ndispersed,\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Morris lectured on \"The Aims of Art\" on July 2nd, at a public\r\nmeeting at South Place Chapel, with Walter Crane in the chair; and\r\nBelfort Bax was the lecturer on July 17th.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting after the holidays was a memorable one, and a few\r\nwords of introduction are necessary.\r\n\r\nIn normal times it may be taken for granted that in addition to the\r\nGovernment and the Opposition there is at least one party of Rebels.\r\nGenerally there are more, since each section has its own rebels, down to\r\nthe tiniest. In the eighties the rebels were Communist Anarchists, and\r\nto us at any rate they seemed more portentous than the mixed crowd of\r\nsuffragettes and gentlemen from Oxford who before the war seemed to be\r\nleading the syndicalist rebels. Anarchist Communism was at any rate a\r\nconsistent and almost sublime doctrine. Its leaders, such as Prince\r\nKropotkin and Nicholas Tchaykovsky, were men of outstanding ability and\r\nunimpeachable character, and the rank and file, mostly refugees from\r\nEuropean oppression, had direct relations with similar parties abroad,\r\nthe exact extent and significance of which we could not calculate.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist League, founded in 1885 by William Morris, Dr. Edward\r\nAveling, and others, as the result of a quarrel, mainly personal, with\r\nthe leaders of the Social Democrats, soon developed its own doctrine,\r\nand whilst never until near its dissolution definitely anarchist, it was\r\nalways dominated by the artistic and anti-political temperament of\r\nMorris. Politically the Fabians were closer to the Social Democrats, but\r\ntheir hard dogmatism was repellent, whilst Morris had perhaps the most\r\nsympathetic and attractive personality of his day.\r\n\r\nThe crisis of the Society's policy is described in the following\r\npassage from Shaw's \"Early History,\":--\r\n\r\n   \"By 1886 we had already found that we were of one mind as to the\r\n   advisability of setting to work by the ordinary political methods and\r\n   having done with Anarchism and vague exhortations to Emancipate the\r\n   Workers. We had several hot debates on the subject with a section of\r\n   the Socialist League which called itself Anti-State Communist, a name\r\n   invented by Mr. Joseph Lane of that body. William Morris, who was\r\n   really a free democrat of the Kropotkin type, backed up Lane, and\r\n   went for us tooth and nail. Records of our warfare may be found in\r\n   the volumes of the extinct magazine called 'To-day,' which was then\r\n   edited by Hubert Bland; and they are by no means bad reading. We soon\r\n   began to see that at the debates the opposition to us came from\r\n   members of the Socialist League, who were present only as visitors.\r\n   The question was, how many followers had our one ascertained\r\n   Anarchist, Mrs. Wilson, among the silent Fabians. Bland and Mrs.\r\n   Besant brought this question to an issue on the 17th September, 1886,\r\n   at a meeting in Anderton's Hotel, by respectively seconding and\r\n   moving the following resolution:\r\n\r\n      \"'That it is advisable that Socialists should organize themselves as\r\n      a political party for the purpose of transferring into the hands of\r\n      the whole working community full control over the soil and the means\r\n      of production, as well as over the production and distribution of\r\n      wealth.'\r\n\r\n      \"To this a rider was moved by William Morris as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"'But whereas the first duty of Socialists is to educate the people\r\n      to understand what their present position is and what their future\r\n      might be, and to keep the principle of Socialism steadily before\r\n      them; and whereas no Parliamentary party can exist without compromise\r\n      and concession, which would hinder that education and obscure those\r\n      principles, it would be a false step for Socialists to attempt to\r\n      take part in the Parliamentary contest.'\r\n\r\n   \"I shall not attempt to describe the debate, in which Morris, Mrs.\r\n   Wilson, Davis, and Tochatti did battle with Burns, Mrs. Besant, Bland,\r\n   Shaw, Donald, and Rossiter: that is, with Fabian and S.D.F. combined.\r\n   Suffice it to say that the minutes of the meeting close with the\r\n   following significant note by the secretary:\r\n\r\n      \"'Subsequently to the meeting, the secretary received notice from\r\n      the manager of Anderton's Hotel that the Society could not be\r\n      accommodated there for any further meetings.'\r\n\r\n   Everybody voted, whether Fabian or not; and Mrs. Besant and Bland\r\n   carried their resolution by 47 to 19, Morris's rider being subsequently\r\n   rejected by 40 to 27.\"\r\n\r\nA short contemporary report written by Mrs. Besant was published in\r\n\"To-day\" for October, 1886, from which it appears that \"Invitations were\r\nsent out to all Socialist bodies in London,\" and that the irregularity\r\nof the proceedings alluded to by Shaw was intentional. The minutes of\r\nthe proceedings treat the meeting as in ordinary course, but it is plain\r\nfrom Mrs. Besant's report that it was an informal attempt to clear the\r\nair in the Socialist movement as well as in the Society itself.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid a breach with Mrs. Wilson and her Fabian sympathisers,\r\nit was resolved to form a Fabian Parliamentary League, which Fabians\r\ncould join or not as they pleased; its constitution, dated February,\r\n1887, is given in full in Tract No. 41; here it is only necessary to\r\nquote one passage which describes the policy of the League and of the\r\nSociety, a policy of deliberate possibilism:--\r\n\r\n   \"The League will take active part in all general and local elections.\r\n   Until a fitting opportunity arises for putting forward Socialist\r\n   candidates to form the nucleus of a Socialist party in Parliament, it\r\n   will confine itself to supporting those candidates who will go\r\n   furthest in the direction of Socialism. It will not ally itself\r\n   absolutely with any political party; it will jealously avoid being\r\n   made use of for party purposes; and it will be guided in its action\r\n   by the character, record, and pledges of the candidates before the\r\n   constituencies. In Municipal, School Board, Vestry, and other local\r\n   elections, the League will, as it finds itself strong enough, run\r\n   candidates of its own, and by placing trustworthy Socialists on\r\n   local representative bodies it will endeavour to secure the\r\n   recognition of the Socialist principle in all the details of local\r\n   government.\"\r\n\r\nIts history is narrated in the same Tract:--\r\n\r\n   \"Here you have the first sketch of the Fabian policy of to-day. The\r\n   Parliamentary League, however, was a short-lived affair. Mrs.\r\n   Wilson's followers faded away, either by getting converted or leaving\r\n   us. Indeed, it is a question with us to this day whether they did not\r\n   owe their existence solely to our own imaginations. Anyhow, it soon\r\n   became plain that the Society was solidly with the Executive on the\r\n   subject of political action, and that there was no need for any\r\n   separate organization at all. The League first faded into a Political\r\n   Committee of the Society, and then merged silently and painlessly\r\n   into the general body.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the lecturers of the autumn of 1886 were H.H. Champion on the\r\nUnemployed, Mrs. Besant on the Economic Position of Women, Percival\r\nChubb, Bernard Shaw on \"Socialism and the Family\"--a pencil note in the\r\nminute book in the lecturer's handwriting says, \"This was one of Shaw's\r\nmost outrageous performances\"--and, in the absence of the Rev. Stopford\r\nBrooke, another by Shaw on \"Why we do not act up to our principles,\"\r\n\r\nA new Tract was adopted in January, 1887. No. 5, \"Facts for Socialists,\"\r\nperhaps the most effective Socialist tract ever published in England. It\r\nhas sold steadily ever since it was issued: every few years it has been\r\nrevised and the figures brought up to date; the edition now on sale,\r\npublished in 1915, is the eleventh. The idea was not new. Statistics of\r\nthe distribution of our national income had been given, as previously\r\nmentioned, in one of the earliest manifestoes of the Democratic\r\nFederation. But in Tract 5 the exact facts were rubbed in with copious\r\nquotations from recognised authorities and illustrated by simple\r\ndiagrams. The full title of the tract was \"Facts for Socialists from the\r\nPolitical Economists and Statisticians,\" and the theme of it was to\r\nprove that every charge made by Socialism against the capitalist system\r\ncould be justified by the writings of the foremost professors of\r\neconomic science. It embodied another Fabian characteristic of\r\nconsiderable importance. Other Socialists then, and many Socialists now,\r\nendeavoured by all means to accentuate their differences from other\r\npeople. Not content with forming societies to advocate their policy,\r\nthey insisted that it was based on a science peculiar to themselves, the\r\nMarxian analysis of value, and the economic interpretation of history:\r\nthey strove too to dissociate themselves from others by the adoption of\r\npeculiar modes of address--such as the use of the words \"comrade\" and\r\n\"fraternal\"--and they were so convinced that no good thing could come\r\nout of the Galilee of capitalism that any countenance of capitalist\r\nparties or of the capitalist press was deemed an act of treachery.\r\n\r\nThe Fabians, on the other hand, tended to the view that \"we are all\r\nSocialists now.\" They held that the pronouncements of economic science\r\nmust be either right or wrong, and in any case science was not a matter\r\nof party; they endeavoured to show that on their opponents' own\r\nprinciples they were logically compelled to be Socialists and must\r\nnecessarily adopt Fabian solutions of social problems.\r\n\r\n\"Facts for Socialists\" was the work of Sidney Webb. No other member\r\npossessed anything like his knowledge of economics and statistics. It\r\nis, as its title implies, simply a mass of quotations from standard\r\nworks on Political Economy, strung together in order to prove that the\r\nbulk of the wealth annually produced goes to a small fraction of the\r\ncommunity in return either for small services or for none at all, and\r\nthat the poverty of the masses results, not as the individualists argue,\r\nfrom deficiencies of individual character, but, as John Stuart Mill had\r\ndeclared, from the excessive share of the national dividend that falls\r\nto the owners of land and capital.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the settlement, by a compromise in structure, of the conflict\r\nbetween the anarchists and the collectivists, the Society entered a\r\nperiod of calm, and the Executive issued a circular complaining of the\r\napathy of the members. Probably this is the first of the innumerable\r\noccasions on which it has been said that the Society had passed its\r\nprime. Moreover, the Executive Committee were blamed for \"some habits\"\r\nwhich had \"a discouraging effect\" on the rest of the Society, and it was\r\nresolved, for the first, but not the last time, to appoint a Committee\r\nto revise the Basis. The Committee consisted of the Executive and eight\r\nadded members, amongst whom may be mentioned Walter Crane, the Rev. S.D.\r\nHeadlam, and Graham Wallas. It is said that after many hours of\r\ndiscussion they arrived by compromise at an unanimous report, and that\r\ntheir draft was accepted by the Society without amendment. The report\r\nwas presented to a meeting on June 3rd, 1887, of which I, on a visit to\r\nLondon, was chairman. It is unfortunate that the record of this meeting,\r\nat which the existing Basis of the Society was adopted, is the only one,\r\nin the whole history of the Society, which is incomplete. Possibly the\r\ncolonial policy of the empire was disturbed, and the secretary occupied\r\nwith exceptional official duties. Anyway the minutes were left\r\nunfinished in June, were continued in October, and were never completed\r\nor recorded as confirmed. The proceedings relating to the Basis were\r\napparently never written. There is no doubt, however, that the Basis was\r\nadopted on this occasion, it is said, at an adjourned meeting, and in\r\nspite of many projects of revision it has with one addition--the phrase\r\nabout \"equal citizenship of women\"--remained the Basis of the Society to\r\nthe present time.[20]\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Basis has been often misunderstood. It is not a\r\nconfession of faith, or a statement of the whole content and meaning of\r\nSocialism. It is merely a test of admission, a minimum basis of\r\nagreement, acceptance of which is required from those who aspire to\r\nshare in the control of a Society which had set out to reconstruct our\r\nsocial system. The most memorable part of the discussion was the\r\nproposal of Mr. Stuart Glennie to add a clause relating to marriage and\r\nthe family. This was opposed by Mrs. Besant, then regarded as an\r\nextremist on that subject, and was defeated. In view of the large amount\r\nof business transacted before the discussion of the Basis began, the\r\ndebate cannot have been prolonged.\r\n\r\nIt is easy enough, nearly thirty years later, to criticise this\r\ndocument, to point out that it is purely economic, and unnecessarily\r\nrigid: that the phrase about compensation, which has been more discussed\r\nthan any other, is badly worded, and for practical purposes always\r\ndisregarded in the constructive proposals of the Society.[21] The best\r\ntestimony to the merits of the Basis is its survival--its acceptance by\r\nthe continuous stream of new members who have joined the Society--and it\r\nhas survived not because its upholders deemed it perfect, but because\r\nit has always been found impracticable to put on paper any alternative\r\non which even a few could agree. In fact, proposals to re-write the\r\nBasis have on several occasions been referred to Committees, but none of\r\nthe Committees has ever succeeded in presenting a report.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year the sole fruit of the Parliamentary League was\r\npublished. It is Tract No. 6, entitled \"The True Radical Programme\" and\r\nconsists of a declamatory criticism of the official Liberal-Radical\r\nProgramme announced at Nottingham in October, 1887, and a demand to\r\nreplace it by the True Radical Programme, namely, adult (in place of\r\nmanhood) suffrage, payment of Members of Parliament and election\r\nexpenses, taxation of unearned incomes, nationalisation of railways, the\r\neight hours day, and a few other items. \"The above programme,\" it says,\r\n\"is sufficient for the present to fill the hands of the True Radical\r\nParty--the New Labour Party--in a word, the Practical Socialist Party,\"\r\nIt is by no means so able and careful a production as the Report on the\r\nGovernment Organisation of Unemployed Labour.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1888, the seven Essayists were elected as the Executive\r\nCommittee, Graham Wallas and William Clarke taking the places of Frank\r\nPodmore and W.L. Phillips, who retired, and at the same meeting the\r\nParliamentary League was turned into the Political Committee of the\r\nSociety; and Tract 7, \"Capital and Land,\" was approved. This tract, the\r\nwork of Sydney Olivier, is a reasoned attack on Single Tax as a panacea,\r\nand in addition contains an estimate of the total realised wealth of the\r\ncountry, just as \"Facts for Socialists\" does of its income. This, too,\r\nhas been regularly revised and reprinted ever since and commands a\r\nsteady sale. It is now in its seventh edition.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the series of meetings, variously described as Public,\r\nOrdinary, and Private, was kept on regularly twice a month, with a break\r\nonly of two months from the middle of July. Most of the meetings were\r\nstill held in the houses of members, but as early as November, 1886, an\r\nordinary meeting was held at Willis's Rooms, King Street, St. James's,\r\nat that time an ultra-respectable rendezvous for societies of the most\r\nselect character, keeping up an old-fashioned ceremonial of crimson\r\ntablecloths, elaborate silver candlesticks, and impressively liveried\r\nfootmen. Having been turned out of Anderton's Hotel, the Society, on the\r\napplication of Olivier, was accepted solemnly at Willis's, probably\r\nbecause the managers regarded the mere fact of our venturing to approach\r\nthem as a certificate of high rank in the world of learned societies.\r\n\r\nOne meeting of this period is perhaps worthy of record. On 16th March,\r\n1888, Mr. R.B. Haldane, M.P., subsequently Secretary of State for War\r\nand Lord Chancellor, addressed the Society on \"Radical Remedies for\r\nEconomic Evils.\" In the pages of the \"Radical,\" Vol. II, No. 8, for\r\nMarch, 1888, can be found a vivid contemporary account of the\r\nproceedings from the pen of Mr. George Standring, entitled \"Butchered to\r\nMake a Fabian Holiday.\" After describing the criticism of the lecture by\r\nSidney Webb, Mrs. Besant, and Bernard Shaw the report proceeds:--\r\n\r\n\"The massacre was concluded by two other members of the Society and then\r\nthe chairman called on Mr. Haldane to reply. Hideous mockery! The\r\nchairman knew that Haldane was _dead_! He had seen him torn and tossed\r\nand trampled under foot. Perhaps he expected the ghost of the M.P. to\r\nrise and conclude the debate with frightful jabberings of fleshless\r\njaws and gestures of bony hands. Indeed I heard a rustling of papers as\r\nif one gathered his notes for a speech; but I felt unable to face the\r\ngrisly horror of a phantom replying to his assassins; so I fled.\"\r\n\r\nIt should be added that Mr. Standring did net become a member of the\r\nSociety until five years later.\r\n\r\nBy the summer of 1888 the leaders of the Society realised that they had\r\na message for the world, and they decided that the autumn should be\r\ndevoted to a connected series of lectures on the \"Basis and Prospects of\r\nSocialism\" which should subsequently be published.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence, however, that the Essayists supposed that they\r\nwere about to make an epoch in the history of Socialism. The meetings in\r\nthe summer had been occupied with lectures by Professor D.G. Ritchie on\r\nthe \"Evolution of Society,\" subsequently published as his well-known\r\nvolume \"Darwinism and Politics.\" Walter Crane on \"The Prospects of Art\r\nunder Socialism,\" Graham Wallas on \"The Co-operative Movement,\" and Miss\r\nClementina Black on \"Female Labour.\" At the last-named meeting, on June\r\n15th, a resolution was moved by H.H. Champion and seconded by Herbert\r\nBurrows (neither of them members) calling on the public to boycott\r\nBryant and May's matches on account of the low wages paid. This marks\r\nthe beginning of the period of Labour Unrest, which culminated in the\r\nDock Strike of the following year.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the autumn was held at Willis's Rooms on September\r\n21st, with the Rev. S.D. Headlam in the chair. The Secretary read a\r\nstatement indicating the scope of the course of the seven lectures\r\narranged for the Society's meetings during the autumn, after which the\r\nfirst paper, written by Sidney Webb on \"The Historical Aspect of the\r\nBasis of Socialism,\" was read by Hubert Bland. Webb had at that time\r\nstarted for a three months' visit to the United States, in which I\r\naccompanied him. Mr. Headlam was the chairman throughout the course,\r\nexcept on one occasion, and the lectures continued fortnightly to the\r\n21st December. It does not appear that any special effort was made to\r\nadvertise them. Each lecture was discussed by members of the Society and\r\nof the S.D.F., and with the exception of the Rev. Philip Wicksteed there\r\nis no evidence of the presence of any persons outside the movement then\r\nor subsequently known to fame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe preparation of \"Fabian Essays\" for publication occupied nearly a\r\nyear, and before dealing with it we must follow the history of the\r\nSociety during that period.\r\n\r\nThe first lecture in 1889 was by Edward Carpenter, whose paper,\r\n\"Civilisation: Its Cause and Cure,\" gives the title to perhaps his best\r\nknown volume of essays. Another interesting lecture was by William\r\nMorris, entitled \"How Shall We Live Then?\" and at the Annual Meeting in\r\nApril Sydney Olivier became the first historian of the Society with an\r\naddress on \"The Origin and Early History of the Fabian Society,\" for\r\nwhich he made the pencil notes on the minute book already mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe seven Essayists were re-elected to the Executive, and in the record\r\nof proceedings at the meeting there is no mention of the proposed volume\r\nof essays.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, possible to give some account of the organisation and\r\nactivities for the year ending in March, 1889, since the first printed\r\nAnnual Report covers that period. It is a four-page quarto document,\r\nonly a few copies of which are preserved. Of the Society itself but\r\nlittle is recorded--a list of lectures and the bare statement that the\r\nautumn series were to be published: the fact that 6500 Fabian Tracts had\r\nbeen distributed and a second edition of 5000 \"Facts for Socialists\"\r\nprinted: that 32 members had been elected and 6 had withdrawn--the total\r\nis not given--and that the deficit in the Society's funds had been\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\nA favourite saying of Sidney Webb's is that the activity of the Fabian\r\nSociety is the sum of the activities of its members. His report as\r\nSecretary of the work of the \"Lecture Committee\" states that a lecture\r\nlist with 33 names had been printed, and returns made by 31 lecturers\r\nrecorded 721 lectures during the year. Six courses of lectures on\r\nEconomics accounted for 52 of these. The \"Essays\" series of lectures was\r\nredelivered by special request in a room lent by King's College,\r\nCambridge, and also at Leicester. Most of the other lectures were given\r\nat London Radical Working Men's Clubs, then and for some years later a\r\nmuch bigger factor in politics than they have been in the twentieth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nBut an almost contemporary account of the life of Bernard Shaw, probably\r\nthe most active of the leaders, because the least fettered by his\r\noccupation, is given in Tract 41 under the heading:\r\n\r\n   \"HOW TO TRAIN FOR PUBLIC LIFE.\r\n\r\n   \"We had to study where we could and how we could. I need not repeat\r\n   the story of the Hampstead Historic Club, founded by a handful of us\r\n   to read Marx and Proudhon, and afterwards turned into a systematic\r\n   history class in which each student took his turn at being professor.\r\n   My own experience may be taken as typical. For some years I attended\r\n   the Hampstead Historic Club once a fortnight, and spent a night in\r\n   the alternate weeks at a private circle of economists which has since\r\n   blossomed into the British Economic Association--a circle where the\r\n   social question was left out, and the work kept on abstract\r\n   scientific lines. I made all my acquaintances think me madder than\r\n   usual by the pertinacity with which I attended debating societies and\r\n   haunted all sorts of hole-and-corner debates and public meetings and\r\n   made speeches at them. I was President of the Local Government Board\r\n   at an amateur Parliament where a Fabian ministry had to put its\r\n   proposals into black and white in the shape of Parliamentary Bills.\r\n   Every Sunday I lectured on some subject which I wanted to teach to\r\n   myself; and it was not until I had come to the point of being able to\r\n   deliver separate lectures, without notes, on Rent, Interest, Profits,\r\n   Wages, Toryism, Liberalism, Socialism, Communism, Anarchism,\r\n   Trade-Unionism, Co-operation, Democracy, the Division of Society into\r\n   Classes, and the Suitability of Human Nature to Systems of Just\r\n   Distribution, that I was able to handle Social-Democracy as it must\r\n   be handled before it can be preached in such a way as to present it\r\n   to every sort of man from his own particular point of view. In old\r\n   lecture lists of the Society you will find my name down for twelve\r\n   different lectures or so. Nowadays I have only one, for which the\r\n   secretary is good enough to invent four or five different names.\r\n   Sometimes I am asked for one of the old ones, to my great dismay, as\r\n   I forget all about them; but I get out of the difficulty by\r\n   delivering the new one under the old name, which does as well. I do\r\n   not hesitate to say that all our best lecturers have two or three old\r\n   lectures at the back of every single point in their best new\r\n   speeches; and this means that they have spent a certain number of\r\n   years plodding away at footling little meetings and dull discussions,\r\n   doggedly placing these before all private engagements, however\r\n   tempting. A man's Socialistic acquisitiveness must be keen enough to\r\n   make him actually prefer spending two or three nights a week in\r\n   speaking and debating, or in picking up social information even in\r\n   the most dingy and scrappy way, to going to the theatre, or dancing\r\n   or drinking, or even sweethearting, if he is to become a really\r\n   competent propagandist--unless, of course, his daily work is of such\r\n   a nature as to be in itself a training for political life; and that,\r\n   we know, is the case with very few of us indeed. It is at such\r\n   lecturing and debating work, and on squalid little committees and\r\n   ridiculous little delegations to conferences of the three tailors of\r\n   Tooley Street, with perhaps a deputation to the Mayor thrown in once\r\n   in a blue moon or so, that the ordinary Fabian workman or clerk must\r\n   qualify for his future seat on the Town Council, the School Board,\r\n   or perhaps in the Cabinet. It was in that way that Bradlaugh, for\r\n   instance, graduated from being a boy evangelist to being one of the\r\n   most formidable debaters in the House of Commons. And the only\r\n   opponents who have ever held their own against the Fabians in debate\r\n   have been men like Mr. Levy or Mr. Foote, who learnt in the same\r\n   school.\"\r\n\r\nBut lecturing was not the only activity of the Fabians. There were at\r\nthat time local Groups, each comprising one or a dozen constituencies in\r\nLondon and its suburbs. The Groups in a corporate capacity did little:\r\nbut the members are reported as taking part in local elections, County\r\nCouncil, School Board, and Vestry, in the meetings of the London Liberal\r\nand Radical Union, the National Liberal Federation, the Metropolitan\r\nRadical Federation, the Women's Liberal Federation, and so on. This was\r\nthe year of the first London County Council Election, when the\r\nProgressive Party, as it was subsequently named, won an unexpected\r\nvictory, which proved to be both lasting and momentous for the future of\r\nthe Metropolis. The only overt part taken by the Fabian Society was its\r\n\"Questions for Candidates,\" printed and widely circulated before the\r\nelection, which gave definiteness and point to the vague ideas of\r\nProgressivism then in the air. A large majority of the successful\r\ncandidates had concurred with this programme. A pamphlet by Sidney Webb,\r\nentitled \"Wanted a Programme,\" not published but printed privately, was\r\nwidely circulated in time for the meeting of the National Liberal\r\nFederation at Birmingham, and another by the same author, \"The Progress\r\nof Socialism,\" stated to be published by \"the Hampstead Society for the\r\nStudy of Socialism,\" is reported as in its second edition. This pamphlet\r\nwas later republished by the Fabian Society as Tract No. 15, \"English\r\nProgress Towards Social Democracy.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Besant and the Rev. Stewart Headlam, standing as Progressives,\r\nwere elected to the School Board in November, 1888, when Hubert Bland\r\nwas an unsuccessful candidate.\r\n\r\nFinally it may be mentioned that a Universities Committee, with Frank\r\nPodmore as Secretary for Oxford and G.W. Johnson for Cambridge, had\r\nbegun the \"permeation\" of the Universities, which has always been an\r\nimportant part of the propaganda of the Society.\r\n\r\nAt the Annual Meeting in April, 1889, the Essayists were re-elected as\r\nthe Executive Committee and Sydney Olivier as Honorary Secretary, but he\r\nonly retained the post till the end of the year. I returned to London in\r\nOctober, was promptly invited to resume the work, and took it over in\r\nJanuary, 1890.\r\n\r\nIn July another important tract was approved for publication. \"Facts for\r\nLondoners,\" No. 8 in the series, 55 pages of packed statistics sold for\r\n6d., was the largest publication the Society had yet attempted. It is,\r\nas its sub-title states: \"an exhaustive collection of statistical and\r\nother facts relating to the Metropolis, with suggestions for reform on\r\nSocialist principles.\" The latter were in no sense concealed: the\r\nSociety still waved the red flag in season and out. \"The Socialist\r\nProgramme of immediately practicable reforms for London cannot be wholly\r\ndissociated from the corresponding Programme for the kingdom.\" This is\r\nthe opening sentence, and it is followed by a page of explanation of the\r\noppression of the workers by the private appropriation of rent and\r\ninterest, and an outline of the proposed reforms, graduated and\r\ndifferentiated income tax, increased death duties, extension of the\r\nFactory Acts, reform of the Poor Law, payment of all public\r\nrepresentatives, adult suffrage, and several others.\r\n\r\nThen the tract settles down to business. London with its County Council\r\nonly a few months old was at length waking to self-consciousness: Mr.\r\nCharles Booth's \"Life and Labour in East London\"--subsequently issued as\r\nthe first part of his monumental work--had just been published; it was\r\nthe subject of a Fabian lecture by Sidney Webb on May 17th; and interest\r\nin the political, economic, and social institutions of the city was\r\ngeneral. The statistical facts were at that time practically unknown.\r\nThey had to be dug out, one by one, from obscure and often unpublished\r\nsources, and the work thus done by the Fabian Society led up in later\r\nyears to the admirable and far more voluminous statistical publications\r\nof the London County Council.\r\n\r\nThe tract deals with area and population; with rating, land values, and\r\nhousing, with water, trams, and docks, all at that time in the hands of\r\nprivate companies, with gas, markets, City Companies, libraries,\r\npublic-houses, cemeteries; and with the local government of London, Poor\r\nLaw Guardians and the poor, the School Board and the schools, the\r\nVestries, District Boards, the County Council, and the City Corporation.\r\nIt was the raw material of Municipal Socialism, and from this time forth\r\nthe Society recognised that the municipalisation of monopolies was a\r\ngenuine part of the Socialist programme, that the transfer from private\r\nexploiters to public management at the start, and ultimately by the\r\namortisation of the loans to public ownership, actually was _pro tanto_\r\nthe transfer from private to public ownership of land and capital, as\r\ndemanded by Socialists.\r\n\r\nHere, in passing, we may remark that there is a legend, current chiefly\r\nin the United States, that the wide extension of municipal ownership in\r\nGreat Britain is due to the advocacy of the Fabian Society. This is very\r\nfar from the truth. The great provincial municipalities took over the\r\nmanagement of their water and gas because they found municipal control\r\nalike convenient, beneficial to the citizens, and financially\r\nprofitable: Birmingham in the seventies was the Mecca of\r\nMunicipalisation, and in 1882 the Electric Lighting Act passed by Mr.\r\nJoseph Chamberlain was so careful of the interests of the public, so\r\nstrict in the limitations it put upon the possible profits to the\r\ninvestor, that electric lighting was blocked in England for some years,\r\nand the Act had to be modified in order that capital might be\r\nattracted.[22]\r\n\r\nWhat the Fabian Society did was to point out that Socialism did not\r\nnecessarily mean the control of all industry by a centralised State;\r\nthat to introduce Socialism did not necessarily require a revolution\r\nbecause much of it could be brought about piecemeal by the votes of the\r\nlocal electors. And secondly the Society complained that London was\r\nsingularly backward in municipal management: that the wealthiest city in\r\nthe world was handed over to the control of exploiters, who made profits\r\nfrom its gas, its water, its docks, and its tramways, whilst elsewhere\r\nthese monopolies were owned and worked by public authorities who\r\nobtained all the advantages for the people of the localities concerned.\r\nMoreover, it may be questioned whether the Fabian advocacy of\r\nmunicipalisation hastened or retarded that process in London. In\r\nprovincial towns municipalisation--the word of course was unknown--had\r\nbeen regarded as of no social or political significance. It was a\r\nbusiness matter, a local affair, a question of convenience. In London,\r\npartly owing to Fabian advocacy and partly because London had at last a\r\nsingle representative authority with a recognised party system, it\r\nbecame the battle ground of the parties: the claim of the Socialists\r\nawakened the Individualists to opposition: and the tramways of London\r\nwere held as a trench in the world-wide conflict between Socialism and\r\nits enemies, whose capture was hailed as an omen of progress by one\r\nside, and by the other deplored as the presage of defeat.\r\n\r\n\"Facts for Londoners\" was the work of Sidney Webb, but there is nothing\r\nin the tract to indicate this. The publications of the Society were\r\ncollective works, in that every member was expected to assist in them by\r\ncriticism and suggestion. Although several of the tracts were lectures\r\nor papers written by members for other purposes, and are so described,\r\nit was not until the issue in November, 1892, of Tract 42, \"Christian\r\nSocialism,\" by the Rev. S.D. Headlam, that the author's name is printed\r\non the title page. The reason for the innovation is obvious: this tract\r\nwas written by a Churchman for Christians, and whilst the Society as a\r\nwhole approved the conclusions, the premises commended themselves to but\r\na few. It was therefore necessary that the responsibility of the author\r\nshould be made clear.\r\n\r\nThe autumn of 1889 is memorable for the great strike of the London\r\nDockers, which broke out on August 14th, was led by John Burns, and was\r\nsettled mainly by Cardinal Manning on September 14th. The Fabian Society\r\nheld no meeting between July 19th and September 20th, and there is\r\nnothing in the minutes or the Annual Report to show that the Society as\r\nsuch took any part in the historic conflict. But many of the members as\r\nindividuals lent their aid to the Dockers in their great struggle, which\r\nonce for all put an end to the belief that hopeless disorganisation is a\r\nnecessary characteristic of unskilled labour.[23]\r\n\r\nArising out of the Dock Strike, the special demand of the Socialist\r\nsection of trade unionists for the next four or five years was a legal\r\neight hours day, and the Fabian Society now for the first time\r\nrecognised that it could render substantial assistance to the labour\r\nmovement by putting into a practicable shape any reform which was the\r\ncurrent demand of the day.\r\n\r\nAt the members' meeting on September 20 a committee was appointed to\r\nprepare an Eight Hours Bill for introduction into Parliament, and in\r\nNovember this was published as Tract No. 9. It consists of a Bill for\r\nParliament, drawn up in proper form, with explanatory notes. It provided\r\nthat eight hours should be the maximum working day for Government\r\nservants, for railway men, and for miners, and that other trades should\r\nbe brought in when a Secretary of State was satisfied that a majority of\r\nthe workers desired it. The tract had a large sale--20,000 had been\r\nprinted in six months--and it was specially useful because, in fact, it\r\nshowed the inherent difficulty of any scheme for universal limitation of\r\nthe hours of labour.\r\n\r\nThe Eight Hours Day agitation attained larger proportions than any other\r\nworking-class agitation in England since the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. For a number of years it was the subject of great annual\r\ndemonstrations in Hyde Park. It commended itself both to the practical\r\ntrade unionists, who had always aimed at a reduction in the hours of\r\nlabour, and to the theoretical socialists, who held that the exploiter's\r\nprofits came from the final hours of the day's work. The Fabian plan of\r\n\"Trade Option\" was regarded as too moderate, and demands were made for a\r\n\"Trade Exemption\" Bill, that is, a Bill enacting a universal Eight Hours\r\nDay, with power to any trade to vote its own exclusion. But the more\r\nthe subject was discussed, the more obvious the difficulties became,\r\nand at last it was recognised that each trade must be dealt with\r\nseparately. Considerable reductions of hours were meantime effected in\r\nparticular industries; an eight-hour day became the rule in the\r\nGovernment factories and dockyards; the Board of Trade was empowered to\r\ninsist on the reduction of unduly long hours of duty on railways;\r\nfinally in 1908 the Miners' Eight Hours Act became law; and the demand\r\nfor any general Bill faded away.\r\n\r\nThe autumn meetings were occupied by a course of lectures at Willis's\r\nRooms on \"A Century of Social Movements,\" by Frank Podmore, William\r\nClarke, Graham Wallas, Hubert Bland, and Mrs. Besant, and with the\r\nbeginning of the year 1890 we come to the publication of \"Fabian\r\nEssays,\" and a new chapter in the History of the Society.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] On this passage Shaw has written the following criticism, which I\r\nhave not adopted because on the whole I do not agree with it: \"I think\r\nthis is wrong, because the Fabians were at first as bellicose as the\r\nothers, and Marx had been under no delusion as to the Commune and did\r\nnot bequeath a tradition of its repetition. Bakunin was as popular a\r\nprophet as Marx. Many of us--Bland and Keddell among others--were\r\nmembers of the S.D.F., and I was constantly speaking for the S.D.F. and\r\nthe League. We did not keep ourselves to ourselves; we aided the working\r\nclass organisations in every possible way; and they were jolly glad to\r\nhave us. In fact the main difference between us was that we worked for\r\neverybody (permeation) and they worked for their own societies only. The\r\nreal reason that we segregated for purposes of thought and study was\r\nthat the workers could not go our pace or stand our social habits.\r\nHyndman and Morris and Helen Taylor and the other bourgeois S.D.F.-ers\r\nand Leaguers were too old for us; they were between forty and fifty when\r\nwe were between twenty and thirty.\"\r\n\r\n[17] On this passage Shaw comments, beginning with an expletive, and\r\nproceeding: \"I was the only one who had any principles. But surely the\r\nsecret of it is that we didn't really want to be demagogues, having\r\nother fish to fry, as our subsequent careers proved. Our decision not to\r\nstand for Parliament in 1892 was the turning point. I was offered some\r\nseats to contest--possibly Labour ones--but I always replied that they\r\nought to put up a bona fide working man. We lacked ambition.\"\r\n\r\n[18] See \"The Great Society,\" by Graham Wallas (Macmillan, 1914), p.\r\n260.\r\n\r\n[19] For a much fuller account of this subject, see Appendix I.

A\r\nbook, to be effective, must maintain a thesis, or at any rate must be a\r\nclosely integrated series of propositions, and, as a rule, thinkers\r\nstrong enough to move the world are too independent to pull together in\r\na team.\r\n\r\n\"Fabian Essays,\" the work of seven writers, all of them far above the\r\naverage in ability, some of them possessing individuality now recognised\r\nas exceptional, is a book and not a collection of essays. This resulted\r\nfrom two causes. The writers had for years known each other intimately\r\nand shared each other's thoughts; they had hammered out together the\r\npolicy which they announced; and they had moulded each other's opinions\r\nbefore they began to write. Secondly the book was planned in advance.\r\nIts scheme was arranged as a whole, and then the parts were allotted\r\nto each author, with an agreement as to the ground to be covered and the\r\nmethod to be adopted, in view of the harmonious whole which the authors\r\nhad designed. It is not often that circumstances permit of a result so\r\nhappy. \"Fabian Essays\" does not cover the whole field of Fabian\r\ndoctrine, and in later years schemes were often set on foot for a second\r\nvolume dealing with the application of the principles propounded in the\r\nfirst. But these schemes never even began to be successful. With the\r\npassage of time the seven essayists had drifted apart. Each was working\r\nat the lines of thought most congenial to himself; they were no longer\r\nyoung and unknown men; some of the seven were no longer available.\r\nAnyway, no second series of Essays ever approached completion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph By Savony of New York_\r\n\r\nMRS. ANNE BESANT, IN 1890]\r\n\r\nBernard Shaw was the editor, and those who have worked with him know\r\nthat he does not take lightly his editorial duties. He corrects his own\r\nwritings elaborately and repeatedly, and he does as much for everything\r\nwhich comes into his care. The high literary level maintained by the\r\nFabian tracts is largely the result of constant scrutiny and amendment,\r\nchiefly by Sidney Webb and Bernard Shaw, although the tract so corrected\r\nmay be published as the work of some other member.\r\n\r\nAlthough therefore all the authors of \"Fabian Essays\" were competent,\r\nand some of them practised writers, it may be assumed that every phrase\r\nwas considered, and every word weighed, by the editor before the book\r\nwent to press.[24]\r\n\r\nA circular inviting subscriptions for the book was sent out in the\r\nspring, and three hundred copies were subscribed in advance.\r\nArrangements with a publisher fortunately broke down because he declined\r\nto have the book printed at a \"fair house,\" and as Mrs. Besant was\r\nfamiliar with publishing--she then controlled, or perhaps _was_, the\r\nFreethought Publishing Company, of 63 Fleet Street--the Committee\r\nresolved on the bold course of printing and publishing the book\r\nthemselves. A frontispiece was designed by Walter Crane, a cover by Miss\r\nMay Morris, and just before Christmas, 1889, the book was issued to\r\nsubscribers and to the public.\r\n\r\nNone of us at that time was sufficiently experienced in the business of\r\nauthorship to appreciate the astonishing success of the venture. In a\r\nmonth the whole edition of 1000 copies was exhausted. With the exception\r\nof Mrs. Besant, whose fame was still equivocal, not one of the authors\r\nhad published any book of importance, held any public office, or was\r\nknown to the public beyond the circles of London political agitators.\r\nThe Society they controlled numbered only about 150 members. The subject\r\nof their volume was far less understood by the public than is\r\nSyndicalism at the present day. And yet a six-shilling book, published\r\nat a private dwelling-house and not advertised in the press, or taken\r\nround by travellers to the trade, sold almost as rapidly as if the\r\nauthors had been Cabinet Ministers.\r\n\r\nA second edition of 1000 copies was issued in March, 1890: in September\r\nMr. Walter Scott undertook the agency of a new shilling paper edition,\r\n5000 of which were sold before publication and some 20,000 more within a\r\nyear. In 1908 a sixpenny paper edition with a new preface by the editor\r\nwas issued by Walter Scott, of which 10,000 were disposed of in a few\r\nmonths, and in all some 46,000 copies of the book have been sold in\r\nEnglish editions alone. It is difficult to trace the number of foreign\r\neditions and translations. The authors made over to the Society all\r\ntheir rights in the volume, and permission for translation and for\r\npublication in the United States has always been freely given. In that\r\ncountry we can trace an edition in 1894, published by Charles E. Brown\r\nof Boston, with an Introduction by Edward Bellamy and a Preface of some\r\nlength on the Fabian Society and its work by William Clarke: and another\r\nedition in 1909, published by the Ball Publishing Company of Boston,\r\nalso with the Introduction on the Fabian Society. A Dutch translation by\r\nF.M. Wibaut was published in 1891; in 1806 the Essays, translated into\r\nNorwegian by Francis Wolff, appeared as a series of small books; and in\r\n1897 a German translation by Dora Lande was issued by G.H. Wigand of\r\nLeipzig.\r\n\r\nThe effect of \"Fabian Essays\" arose as much from what it left out as\r\nfrom what it contained. Only the fast-dwindling band of pioneer\r\nSocialists, who lived through the movement in its earliest days, can\r\nfully realise the environment of ideas from which \"Fabian Essays\" showed\r\na way of escape.\r\n\r\nThe Socialism of the Social Democratic Federation and the Socialist\r\nLeague, the two societies which had hitherto represented Socialism to\r\nthe general public, was altogether revolutionary. Socialism was to be\r\nthe result of an outbreak of violence, engineered by a great popular\r\norganisation like that of the Chartists or the Anti-Corn Law League, and\r\nthe Commune of Paris in 1871 was regarded as a premature attempt which\r\npointed the way to future success. The Socialist Government thus\r\nestablished was to reconstruct the social and industrial life of the\r\nnation according to a plan supposed to be outlined by Karl Marx. \"On the\r\nmorrow of the revolution\" all things would be new, and at a bound the\r\nnation was expected to reach something very like the millennium.\r\n\r\nThe case for this project was based, strange to say, not on any history\r\nbut on the Marxian analysis of the origin of the value of commodities,\r\nand no man who did not understand this analysis, or pretend to\r\nunderstand it, was fit to be called a \"comrade.\" The economic reasoning\r\nwhich \"proved\" this \"law\" was expressed in obscure and technical\r\nlanguage peculiar to the propagandists of the movement, and every page\r\nof Socialist writings was studded with the then strange words\r\n\"proletariat\" and \"bourgeoisie.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, the whole world, outside the socialist movement, was regarded as\r\nin a conspiracy of repression. Liberals (all capitalists), Tories (all\r\nlandlords), the Churches (all hypocrites), the rich (all idlers), and\r\nthe organised workers (all sycophants) were treated as if they fully\r\nunderstood and admitted the claims of the Socialists, and were\r\ndetermined for their own selfish ends to reject them at all costs.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Fabian propaganda had no doubt had some effect, especially\r\namongst the working-class Radicals of London, and although some of the\r\nSocialist writers and speakers, such as William Morris, did not at all\r\ntimes present to the public the picture of Socialism just outlined, it\r\nwill not be denied by anybody whose recollections reach back to this\r\nperiod that Socialism up to 1890 was generally regarded as\r\ninsurrectionary, dogmatic, Utopian, and almost incomprehensible.\r\n\r\n\"Fabian Essays\" presented the case for Socialism in plain language which\r\neverybody could understand. It based Socialism, not on the speculations\r\nof a German philosopher, but on the obvious evolution of society as we\r\nsee it around us. It accepted economic science as taught by the\r\naccredited British professors; it built up the edifice of Socialism on\r\nthe foundations of our existing political and social institutions: it\r\nproved that Socialism was but the next step in the development of\r\nsociety, rendered inevitable by the changes which followed from the\r\nindustrial revolution of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting after twenty-five years to re-read these essays and to\r\nobserve how far the ideas that inspired them are still valid, and how\r\nfar the prophecies made have been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nBernard Shaw contributed the first Essay on \"The Economic Basis of\r\nSocialism,\" and also a second, a paper read to the British Association\r\nin September, 1888, on the \"Transition to Social Democracy.\" His\r\ncharacteristic style retains its charm, although the abstract and purely\r\ndeductive economic analysis on which he relied no longer commends itself\r\nto the modern school of thought. Sidney Webb's \"Historic Basis\" is as\r\nreadable as ever, except where he quotes at length political programmes\r\nlong forgotten, and recounts the achievements of municipal socialism\r\nwith which we are all now familiar.\r\n\r\nWilliam Clarke in explaining the \"Industrial Basis\" assumed that the\r\nindustry would be rapidly dominated by trusts--then a new\r\nphenomenon--with results, the crushing out of all other forms of\r\nindustrial organisation, which are but little more evident to-day,\r\nthough we should no longer think worthy of record that the Standard Oil\r\nCompany declared a 10 per cent cash dividend in 1887!\r\n\r\nIf the Essays had been written in 1890 instead of 1888 the authors would\r\nhave acquired from the great Trade Union upheaval of 1889 a fuller\r\nappreciation of the importance of Trade Unionism than they possessed at\r\nthe earlier date. Working-class organisation has never been so prominent\r\nin London as in the industrial counties, and the captious comments on\r\nthe great Co-operative movement show that the authors of the Essays\r\nwere still youthful, and in some matters ignorant.[25]\r\n\r\nSydney Olivier's \"Moral Basis\" is, in parts, as obscure now as it was at\r\nfirst, and there are pages which can have conveyed but little to most of\r\nits innumerable readers. Graham Wallas treated of \"Property\" with\r\nmoderation rather than knowledge. Time has dealt hardly with Mrs.\r\nBesant's contribution. She anticipated, as the other Essayists did, that\r\nunemployment caused by labour-saving machinery would constantly\r\nincrease; and that State organisation of industries for the unemployed\r\nwould gradually supersede private enterprise. She apparently supposed\r\nthat the county councils all over England, then newly created, were\r\nsimilar in character to the London County Council, which had already\r\ninaugurated the Progressive policy destined in the next few years to do\r\nmuch for the advancement of practical socialism. The final paper on \"The\r\nOutlook,\" by Hubert Bland, is necessarily of the nature of prophecy, and\r\nin view of the difficulty of this art his attempt is perhaps less\r\nunsuccessful than might have been expected. He could foresee the advent\r\nneither of the Labour Party, mainly formed of Trade Unionists, nor of\r\nMr. Lloyd George and the policy he represents: he assumed that the rich\r\nwould grow richer and the poor poorer; that Liberals would unite with\r\nTories, as they have done in Australia, and would be confronted with a\r\nSocialist Party representing the dispossessed. Possibly the developments\r\nhe sketches are still to come, but that is a matter which cannot be\r\ndiscussed here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI can find no trace in the records of the Society that the first success\r\nof their publication occasioned any elation to the Essayists, and I\r\ncannot recollect any signs of it at the time. The Annual Report mentions\r\nthat a substantial profit was realised on the first edition, and states\r\nthat the authors had made over the copyright, \"valued at about £200,\" to\r\nthe Society; but these details are included in a paragraph headed\r\n\"Publications,\" and the Essays are not mentioned in the general sketch\r\nof the work of the year.\r\n\r\nIn fact the obvious results of the publication took some months to\r\nmaterialise, and the number of candidates for election to the Society\r\nshowed little increase during the spring. It is true that great changes\r\nwere made in the organisation of the Society at the Annual Meeting held\r\non March 28th, 1890, but these were in part due to other causes. The\r\nExecutive Committee was enlarged to fifteen, and as I happened to be\r\navailable I was appointed paid secretary, half time, at the modest\r\nsalary of £1 a week for the first year. The newly elected Executive\r\nincluded the seven Essayists, Robert E. Dell, now Paris correspondent\r\nfor several journals, W.S. De Mattos, for many years afterwards an\r\nindefatigable organiser for the Society, and now settled in British\r\nColumbia, the Rev. Stewart D. Headlam, Mrs. L.T. Mallet, then a\r\nprominent member of the Women's Liberal Association, J.F. Oakeshott, of\r\nthe Fellowship of the New Life, and myself.\r\n\r\nThe lectures of the early months of 1890 were a somewhat brilliant\r\nseries. Sidney Webb on the Eight Hours Bill; James Rowlands, M.P., on\r\nthe then favourite Liberal nostrum of Leasehold Enfranchisement (which\r\nthe Essayists demolished in a crushing debate); Dr. Bernard Bosanquet on\r\n\"The Antithesis between Individualism and Socialism Philosophically\r\nConsidered\"; Mrs. Besant on \"Socialism and the School Board Policy\"; Mr.\r\n(now Sir) H. Llewellyn Smith on \"The Causes and Effects of Immigration\r\nfrom Country to Town,\" in which he disproved the then universal opinion\r\nthat the unemployed of East London were immigrants from rural districts;\r\nSydney Olivier on \"Zola\"; William Morris on \"Gothic Architecture\"\r\n(replacing a lecture on Morris himself by Ernest Radford, who was absent\r\nthrough illness); Sergius Stepniak on \"Tolstoi, Tchernytchevsky, and the\r\nRussian School\"; Hubert Bland on \"Socialist Novels\"; and finally on July\r\n18th Bernard Shaw on \"Ibsen.\" This last may perhaps be regarded as the\r\nhigh-water mark in Fabian lectures. The minutes, which rarely stray\r\nbeyond bare facts, record that \"the paper was a long one,\" nearer two\r\nhours than one, if my memory is accurate, and add: \"The meeting was a\r\nvery large one and the lecture was well received.\" In fact the lecture\r\nwas the bulk of the volume \"The Quintessence of Ibsenism,\" which some\r\nregard as the finest of Bernard Shaw's works, and it is perhaps\r\nunnecessary to say that the effect on the packed audience was\r\noverwhelming. It was \"briefly discussed\" by a number of speakers, but\r\nthey seemed as out of place as a debate after an oratorio.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn June 16th Henry H. Hutchinson of Derby was elected a member, an event\r\nof much greater importance than at the time appeared. Mr. Hutchinson had\r\nbeen clerk to the Justices of Derby, and when we first knew him had\r\nretired, and was with his wife living a somewhat wandering life\r\naccompanied by a daughter, who also joined the Society a few months\r\nlater. He was not rich, but he was generous, and on July 29th it is\r\nrecorded in the minutes of the Executive that he had offered us £100 or\r\n£200, and approved the suggestion that it should be chiefly used for\r\nlectures in country centres.\r\n\r\nA fortnight later the \"Lancashire campaign\" was planned. It was\r\nthoroughly organised. An advanced agent was sent down, and abstracts of\r\nlectures were prepared and printed to facilitate accurate reports in the\r\npress. Complete lists of the forthcoming lectures--dates, places,\r\nsubjects, and lecturers--were printed. All the Essayists except Olivier\r\ntook part, and in addition Robert E. Dell, W.S. De Mattos, and the Rev.\r\nStewart Headlam. An account of the Society written by Bernard Shaw was\r\nreprinted from the \"Scottish Leader\" for September 4th, 1890, for the\r\nuse of the audience and the Press.\r\n\r\nA \"Report\" of the campaign was issued on November 4th, which says:--\r\n\r\n\"The campaign began on September 20th and ended on October 27th, when\r\nabout sixty lectures in all had been delivered ... not only in\r\nLancashire, at Manchester, Liverpool, Rochdale, Oldham, Preston,\r\nSalford, and the district round Manchester, but also at Barnsley,\r\nKendal, Carlisle, Sheffield, and Hebden Bridge.\r\n\r\n\"In thus making our first attack upon the stronghold of the old Unionism\r\nand the new Toryism, we would have been contented with a very small\r\nmeasure of success, and we are much more than contented with the results\r\nobtained. The lectures, except for a few days during the contest at\r\nEccles, were extremely well reported, and even the 'Manchester Guardian'\r\n(the 'Daily News' of the manufacturing districts) came out with an\r\napproving leader. The audiences throughout the campaign steadily\r\nincreased and followed the lectures with close and intelligent\r\nattention. In particular the members of Liberal working men's clubs\r\nconstantly declared that they had never heard 'the thing put so\r\nstraight' before, and complained that the ordinary party lecturers were\r\nafraid or unwilling to speak out. Men who frankly confessed that they\r\nhad hesitated before voting for the admission of our lecturers to their\r\nclubs were enthusiastic in welcoming our message as soon as they heard\r\nit. The vigorous propaganda in the manufacturing districts of the S.D.F.\r\nbranches has been chiefly carried on by means of outdoor meetings. Its\r\neffect upon working-class opinion, especially among unskilled labourers,\r\nhas been marked and important, but it has entirely failed to reach the\r\nworking-men politicians who form the rank and file of the Liberal\r\nAssociations and Clubs, or the 'well-dressed' Liberals who vaguely\r\ndesire social reform, but have been encouraged by their leaders to avoid\r\nall exact thought on the subject.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lectures were given chiefly in sets of four in consecutive weeks,\r\nmostly at Liberal and Radical Clubs: others were arranged by\r\nCo-operative Societies, and by branches of the S.D.F. and the Socialist\r\nLeague. The subjects were \"Socialism,\" \"Where Liberalism Fails,\"\r\n\"Co-operation and Labour,\" \"The Future of Women,\" \"The Eight Hours\r\nBill,\" \"The Politics of Labour,\" and so on. Those arranged by\r\nCo-operative Societies were, we are told, the least successful, but it\r\nis hoped \"that they will bring about a better feeling between Socialists\r\nand Co-operators,\" a state of things which on the side of the Socialists\r\nwas, as we have previously indicated, badly wanted. It should be noted\r\nthat much of the success of the campaign was due to friendly assistance\r\nfrom the head-quarters of the Co-operative Union and the National Reform\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that this campaign with the series of lectures on the\r\nsame lines which were continued for several years was an event of some\r\nimportance, not only in the history of the Fabian Society but also in\r\nEnglish politics. Hitherto the Socialism presented to the industrial\r\ndistricts of England, which are the backbone of Trade Unionism and\r\nCo-operation, to the men who are meant when we speak of the power and\r\nindependence of the working classes, was revolutionary and destructive,\r\nill-tempered and ungenerous. It had perhaps alarmed, but it had failed\r\nto attract them. It had made no real impression on the opinion of the\r\npeople. From this point a new movement began. It first took the form of\r\nlocal Fabian Societies. They were succeeded by and merged into branches\r\nof the Independent Labour Party, which adopted everything Fabian except\r\nits peculiar political tactics. A few years later the Labour Party\r\nfollowed, more than Fabian in its toleration in the matter of opinions,\r\nand virtually, though not formally, Fabian in its political policy. No\r\ndoubt something of the sort would have happened had there never been a\r\nLancashire campaign, but this campaign may be fairly described as the\r\nfirst step in an evolution, the end of which is not yet in sight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHer lectures in the Lancashire campaign and the formation of the\r\nbranches were Mrs. Besant's last contributions to the Socialist\r\nmovement. Early in November she suddenly and completely severed her\r\nconnection with the Society. She had become a convert to Theosophy,\r\nwhich at that time accepted the Buddhist doctrine that spiritual\r\nconditions alone mattered, and that spiritual life would flourish as\r\nwell in the slum amidst dirt and starvation as in the comfortable\r\ncottage, and much better than in the luxurious mansion.\r\nTwentieth-century theosophy has receded from that position, and now\r\nadvocates social amelioration, but Mrs. Besant thought otherwise in\r\n1890. Some twenty years later she lectured on several occasions to the\r\nSociety, and she joined her old friends at the dinner which celebrated\r\nthe thirtieth anniversary of its foundation, but in the interval her\r\nconnection with it completely ceased.\r\n\r\nThe Fabian Society and British Socialism owe much to Mrs. Besant for the\r\nassistance she gave it during five important years. Her splendid\r\neloquence, always at our service, has seldom been matched, and has never\r\nbeen surpassed by any of the innumerable speakers of the movement. She\r\nhad, when she joined us, an assured position amongst the working-class\r\nRadicals in London and throughout the country; and through her Socialism\r\nobtained a sympathetic hearing in places where less trusted speakers\r\nwould have been neglected. She was not then either a political thinker\r\nor an effective worker on committees, but she possessed the power of\r\nexpressing the ideas of other people far better than their originators,\r\nand she had at her command a certain amount of political machinery--such\r\nas an office at 63 Fleet Street, and a monthly magazine, \"Our\r\nCorner\"--which was very useful. Her departure was a serious loss, but it\r\ncame at a moment of rapid expansion, so rapid that her absence was\r\nscarcely felt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the Society itself the effect of the Essays and the Lancashire\r\nCampaign was considerable. As the Executive Committee report in April,\r\n1891: \"During the past year the Socialist movement has made conspicuous\r\nprogress in every respect, and a constantly increasing share of the work\r\nof its organisation and extension has fallen to the Fabian Society.\" The\r\nmembership increased from 173 to 361, and the subscription list--thanks\r\nin part to several large donations--from £126 to £520. Local Fabian\r\nSocieties had been formed at Belfast, Birmingham, Bombay, Bristol,\r\nHuddersfield, Hyde, Leeds, Manchester, Oldham, Plymouth, Tyneside, and\r\nWolverhampton, with a total membership of 350 or 400. The business in\r\ntracts had been enormous. Ten new tracts, four pamphlets and six\r\nleaflets, were published, and new editions of all but one of the old\r\nones had been printed. In all 335,000 tracts were printed and 98,349\r\ndistributed. The new tracts include \"The Workers' Political Programme,\"\r\n\"The New Reform Bill,\" \"English Progress Towards Social Democracy,\" \"The\r\nReform of Poor Law,\" and a leaflet, No. 13, \"What Socialism Is,\" which\r\nhas been in circulation ever since. It should be added that at this\r\nperiod our leaflets were given away freely, a form of propaganda which\r\nsoon proved too expensive for our resources.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1891, just before the end of the official year, appeared the\r\nfirst number of \"Fabian News,\" the monthly organ of the Society, which\r\nhas continued ever since. It replaced the printed circulars previously\r\nissued to the members, and was not intended to be anything else than a\r\nmeans of communicating with the members as to the work of the Society,\r\nand also in later years as to new books on subjects germane to its work.\r\nIt has been edited throughout by the Secretary, but everything of a\r\ncontentious character relating to the affairs of the Society has been\r\npublished by the express authority of the Executive Committee.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned that from this time forward the documents of the\r\nSociety are both fuller and more accessible than before. For the period\r\nup to the end of 1889 the only complete record is contained in the two\r\nminute books of the meetings. No regular minutes of Executive Committee\r\nmeetings were kept, and the Annual Reports were not printed until 1889.\r\nFrom 1890 onwards the meetings of every committee were regularly\r\nrecorded: the Annual Reports were printed in octavo and can be found in\r\nmany public libraries, whilst \"Fabian News\" contains full information of\r\nthe current doings of the Society. It will not therefore be necessary to\r\ntreat the later years with such attention to detail as has seemed\r\nappropriate to the earlier. The only \"sources\" for these are shabby\r\nnotebooks and the memories of a few men now rapidly approaching old age.\r\nThe later years can be investigated, if any subsequent enquirer desires\r\nto do so, in a dozen libraries in Great Britain and the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Van der Weyde_\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CLARKE, ABOUT 1895]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] Shaw demurs to this passage, and says that he did not revise the\r\npapers verbally, especially those by Mrs. Besant and Graham Wallas, but\r\nthat he suggested or made alterations in the others. I am still disposed\r\nto suspect that my statement is not far from the truth.\r\n\r\n[25] The opinions of some of the Essayists about co-operation were\r\napparently modified by some small meetings with leading co-operators on\r\nMarch 27th, April 17th, and May 22nd, 1889. Bernard Shaw tells me that\r\nhe thinks that they were held at Willis's Rooms, that he was in the\r\nchair, and that Mr. Benjamin Jones (whose name I find as a speaker at\r\nFabian Meetings about this period) played a prominent part on behalf of\r\nthe Co-operative Wholesale Society.\r\n\r\nThe first printed Annual Report presented on 5th April, 1889, mentions\r\nthat \"the Society is taking part in a 'Round Table Conference' to\r\nascertain amongst other objects how far the various Co-operative and\r\nSocialist bodies can act together politically,\" a problem, thirty years\r\nlater, still unsolved. It is a pity that the references to Co-operation\r\nin \"Fabian Essays\" were not modified in the light of the Conference\r\nwhich was held after the lectures were written but before they were\r\npublished. No record of the Conference seems to have been preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\n\"To your tents, O Israel\": 1894-1900\r\n\r\n   Progress of the Society--The Independent Labour Party--Local Fabian\r\n   Societies--University Fabian Societies--London Groups and Samuel\r\n   Butler--The first Fabian Conference--Tracts and Lectures--The 1892\r\n   Election Manifesto--The Newcastle Program--The Fair Wages Policy--The\r\n   \"Fortnightly\" article--The \"Intercepted Letter\" of 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next two or three years the Society made rapid progress. The\r\nmembership was 541 in 1892, 640 in 1893, and 681 in 1894. The\r\nexpenditure, £640 to March, 1891, rose to £1100 for 1892, and £1179 in\r\n1893. In both these years large sums--£350 and £450--were given by two\r\nmembers for the expenses of lectures in the provinces, and in provincial\r\nsocieties the growth was most marked. In March, 1892, 36 were recorded:\r\nthe report for 1893 gives 74, including Bombay and South Australia. This\r\nwas the high-water mark. The Independent Labour Party was founded in\r\nJanuary, 1893, at a Conference at which the Fabian Society of London and\r\nnine local Fabian Societies were represented, and from this time onward\r\nour provincial organisation declined until, in 1900, only four local and\r\nfour University Societies remained.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the parent society towards its branches has always been\r\nsomewhat unusual. In early days it made admission to its own ranks a\r\nmatter of some difficulty. A candidate resident in London had to secure\r\na proposer and seconder who could personally vouch for him and had to\r\nattend two meetings as a visitor. We regarded membership as something of\r\na privilege, and a candidate was required not only to sign the Basis,\r\nbut also to take some personal trouble as evidence of zeal and good\r\nfaith. To our provincial organisation the same principle was applied. If\r\nthe Socialists in any town desired to form a local society we gave them\r\nour blessing and received them gladly. But we did not urge the formation\r\nof branches on lukewarm adherents, and we always recognised that the\r\npeculiar political methods of the London Society, appropriate to a body\r\nof highly educated people, nearly all of them speakers, writers, or\r\nactive political workers, were unsuitable for the groups of earnest\r\nworkmen in the provinces who were influenced by our teaching. In fact\r\nthe local Fabian Societies, with rare exceptions, of which Liverpool was\r\nthe chief, were from the first \"I.L.P.\" in personnel and policy, and\r\nwere Fabian only in name.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat detached attitude, combined with the recognition of the\r\ndifferences between the parent society and its offspring, led to the\r\nadoption of a system of local autonomy. The parent society retained\r\ncomplete control over its own affairs. It was governed by a mass meeting\r\nof members, which in those days elected the Executive for the year. It\r\ndecided that a local Fabian Society might be formed anywhere outside\r\nLondon, by any body of people who accepted the Fabian Basis. The parent\r\nsociety would send them lecturers, supply them with literature and\r\n\"Fabian News,\" and report their doings in the \"News.\" But in other\r\nrespects complete autonomy was accorded. No fees were asked, or\r\nsubventions granted: no control over, or responsibility for, policy was\r\nclaimed. Just as the political policy of each Fabian was left to his\r\nown judgment, so we declined the impossible task of supervising or\r\nharmonising the political activities of our local societies. When the\r\nI.L.P. was founded in Bradford and set to work to organise Socialism on\r\nFabian lines, adopting practically everything of our policy, except the\r\nparticular methods which we had selected because they suited our\r\npersonal capacities, we recognised that provincial Fabianism had done\r\nits work. There was no room, except here and there, for an I.L.P. branch\r\nand a local F.S. in the same place. The men who were active in the one\r\nwere active also in the other. We made no effort to maintain our\r\norganisation against that of the I.L.P., and though a few societies\r\nsurvived for some years, and for a while two or three were formed every\r\nyear at such places as Tunbridge Wells, Maidstone, and Swindon, they\r\nwere bodies of small importance, and contributed scarcely anything to\r\nthe sum of Fabian activity. The only local Fabian Society which survived\r\nthe debacle was Liverpool, which has carried on work similar to that of\r\nthe London Society down to the present time. Its relations with the\r\nI.L.P. have always been harmonious, and, like the I.L.P., it has always\r\nmaintained an attitude of hostility towards the old political parties.\r\nIts work has been lecturing, the publication of tracts, and political\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\nThe University Fabian Societies are of a different character. Formed by\r\nand for undergraduates, but in some cases, especially at Oxford,\r\nmaintaining continuity by the assistance of older members in permanent\r\nresidence, such as Sidney Ball of St. John's, who has belonged to the\r\nOxford Society since its formation in 1895, they are necessarily\r\nfluctuating bodies, dependent for their success on the personality and\r\ninfluence of a few leading members. Their members have always been\r\nelected at once to the parent society in order that the connection may\r\nbe unbroken when they leave the University. Needless to say, only a\r\nsmall proportion become active members of the Society, but a few of the\r\nleading members of the movement have entered it in this way. Oxford,\r\nGlasgow, Aberystwyth, and latterly Cambridge have had flourishing\r\nsocieties for long periods, and quite a number of the higher grade civil\r\nservants and of the clergy and doctors in remote districts in Wales and\r\nScotland are or have been members. Moreover, the Society always retains\r\na scattering of members, mostly officials or teachers, in India, in the\r\nheart of Africa, in China, and South America, who joined it in their\r\nundergraduate days.\r\n\r\nAlmost from the first the Executive has endeavoured to organise the\r\nmembers in the London area into groups. The parent society grew up\r\nthrough years of drawing-room meetings; why should not the members\r\nresiding in Hampstead and Hammersmith, in Bloomsbury or Kensington do\r\nthe same? Further, the Society always laid much stress on local\r\npolitics: there were County Council and Borough Council, School Board\r\nand Poor Law Guardians elections in which policy could be influenced and\r\ncandidates promoted or supported.\r\n\r\nIn fact it is only in the years when London government was in the\r\nmelting-pot, or in times of special socialist activity, and in a few\r\ndistricts, such as Hampstead, where Fabians are numerous, and especially\r\nwhen one or more persons of persistence and energy are available, that\r\nthe groups have had a more than nominal existence. The drawing-room\r\nmeetings of the parent society attracted audiences until they outgrew\r\ndrawing-rooms, because of the exceptional quality of the men and women\r\nwho attended them and the novelty of the doctrines promulgated. These\r\nconditions were not repeated in each district of London, and in spite\r\nof constant paper planning, and not a little service by the older\r\nmembers, who spent their time and talents on tiny meetings in Paddington\r\nor Streatham, the London group system has never been a permanent\r\nsuccess. What has kept the Society together is the series of fortnightly\r\nmeetings carried on regularly from the first, which themselves fluctuate\r\nin popularity, but which have never wholly failed.[26]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now return to the point whence this digression started. Our local\r\nsocieties were then flourishing. They were vigorously supported from\r\nLondon. We had funds for the expenses of lecturers and many willing to\r\ngive the time. W.S. De Mattos was employed as lecture secretary, and\r\narranged in the year 1891-2 600 lectures, 300 of them in the provinces.\r\nIn all 3339 lectures by members during the year were recorded. All this\r\nactivity imparted for a time considerable vitality to the local\r\nsocieties, and on February 6th and 7th, 1892, the first (and for twenty\r\nyears the last) Annual Conference was held in London, at Essex Hall.\r\nOnly fourteen provincial societies were represented, but they claimed a\r\nmembership of about 1100, some four-fifths of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe Conference was chiefly memorable because it occasioned the\r\npreparation of the paper by Bernard Shaw, entitled \"The Fabian Society:\r\nWhat it has done and how it has done it,\" published later as Tract 41\r\nand renamed, when the passage of years rendered the title obsolete, \"The\r\nFabian Society: Its Early History,\" parts of which have already been\r\nquoted. This entertaining account of the Society, and brilliant defence\r\nof its policy as opposed to that of the Social Democratic Federation,\r\nwas read to a large audience on the Saturday evening, and made so great\r\nan impression that comment on it seemed futile and was abandoned. The\r\nConference on Sunday was chiefly occupied with the discussion of a\r\nproposal that the electors be advised to vote at the coming General\r\nElection in accordance with certain test questions, which was defeated\r\nby 23 to 21. A resolution to expel from the Society any member becoming\r\n\"an official of the Conservative, Liberal, Liberal Unionist, or National\r\nLeague parties\" was rejected by a large majority, for the first but by\r\nno means for the last time. The Conference was quite a success, but a\r\nyear later there was not sufficient eagerness in the provinces for a\r\nsecond, and the project was abandoned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmidst all this propaganda of the principles of Socialism the activity\r\nof the Society in local government was in no way relaxed. The output of\r\ntracts at this period was remarkable. In the year 1890-1, 10 new tracts\r\nwere published, 335,000 copies printed, and 98,349 sold or given away.\r\nIn 1891-2, 20 tracts, 16 of them leaflets of 4 pages, were published,\r\n308,300 printed, and 378,281 distributed, most of them leaflets. This\r\nwas the maximum. Next year only 272,660 were distributed, though the\r\nsales of penny tracts were larger. At this period the Society had a\r\nvirtual monopoly in the production of political pamphlets in which facts\r\nand figures were marshalled in support of propositions of reform in the\r\ndirection of Socialism. Immense trouble was taken to ensure accuracy and\r\nliterary excellence. Many of the tracts were prepared by Committees\r\nwhich held numerous meetings. Each of them was criticised in proof both\r\nby the Executive and by all the members of the Society. Every tract\r\nbefore publication had to be approved at a meeting of members, when the\r\nauthor or authors had to consider every criticism and justify, amend, or\r\ndelete the passage challenged.\r\n\r\nThe tracts published in these years included a series of \"Questions\" for\r\ncandidates for Parliament and all the local governing bodies embodying\r\nprogressive programmes of administration with possible reforms in the\r\nlaw--which the candidate was requested to answer by a local elector and\r\nwhich were used with much effect for some years--and a number of\r\nleaflets on Municipal Socialism, extracted from \"Facts for Londoners.\"\r\nIn 1891 the first edition of \"What to Read: A List of Books for Social\r\nReformers,\" classified in a somewhat elaborate fashion, was prepared by\r\nGraham Wallas, the fifth edition of which, issued as a separate volume\r\nin 1910, is still in print. \"Facts for Bristol,\" drafted by the\r\ngentleman who is now Sir Hartmann Just, K.C.M.G., C.B., was the only\r\nsuccessful attempt out of many to apply the method of \"Facts for\r\nLondoners\" to other cities.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to estimate how far the Progressive policy of\r\nLondon in the early nineties is to be attributed to the influence of the\r\nFabian Society. That must be left to the judgment of those who can form\r\nan impartial opinion. Something, however, the Society must have\r\ncontributed to create what was really a remarkable political phenomenon.\r\nLondon up to 1906 was Conservative in politics by an overwhelming\r\nmajority. In 1892 out of 59 seats the Liberals secured 23, but in 1895\r\nand 1900 they obtained no more than 8 at each election. All this time\r\nthe Progressive Party in the County Council, which came into office\r\nunexpectedly after the confused election in 1889 when the Council was\r\ncreated, maintained itself in power usually by overwhelming majorities,\r\nobtained at each succeeding triennial elections in the same\r\nconstituencies and with substantially the same electorate that returned\r\nConservatives to Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn the early nineties the Liberal and Radical Working Men's Clubs of\r\nLondon had a political importance which has since entirely disappeared.\r\nEvery Sunday for eight months in the year, and often on weekdays,\r\npolitical lectures were arranged, which were constantly given by\r\nFabians. For instance, in October, 1891, I find recorded in advance\r\ntwelve courses of two to five lectures each, nine of them at Clubs, and\r\nfifteen separate lectures at Clubs, all given by members of the Society.\r\nIn October, 1892, eleven courses and a dozen separate lectures by our\r\nmembers at Clubs are notified. These were all, or nearly all, arranged\r\nby the Fabian office, and it is needless to say that a number of others\r\nwere not so arranged or were not booked four or five weeks in advance.\r\nOur list of over a hundred lecturers, with their subjects and private\r\naddresses, was circulated in all directions and was constantly used by\r\nthe Clubs, as well as by all sorts of other societies which required\r\nspeakers.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in addition to \"Facts for Londoners,\" Sidney Webb published in\r\n1891 in Sonnenschein's \"Social Science Series\" a volume entitled \"The\r\nLondon Programme,\" which set out his policy, and that of the Society, on\r\nall the affairs of the metropolis. The Society had at this time much\r\ninfluence through the press. \"The London Programme\" had appeared as a\r\nseries of articles in the Liberal weekly \"The Speaker.\" The \"Star,\"\r\nfounded in 1888, was promptly \"collared,\" according to Bernard Shaw,[27]\r\nwho was its musical critic, and who wrote in it, so it was said, on\r\nevery subject under the sun except music! Mr. H.W. Massingham, assistant\r\neditor of the \"Star,\" was elected to the Society and its Executive\r\nsimultaneously in March, 1891, and in 1892 he became assistant editor of\r\nthe \"Daily Chronicle,\" under a sympathetic chief, Mr. A.E. Fletcher.\r\n\r\nMrs. Besant and the Rev. Stewart Headlam had been elected to the London\r\nSchool Board in 1888, and had there assisted a Trade Union\r\nrepresentative in getting adopted the first Fair Wages Clause in\r\nContracts. But in the first London County Council the Society, then a\r\ntiny body, was not represented.\r\n\r\nAt the second election in 1892 six of its members were elected to the\r\nCouncil and another was appointed an alderman. Six of these were members\r\nbest known to the public as Trade Unionists or in other organisations,\r\nbut Sidney Webb, who headed the poll at Deptford with 4088 votes, whilst\r\nhis Progressive colleague received 2503, and four other candidates only\r\n5583 votes between them, was a Fabian and nothing else. He had\r\nnecessarily to resign his appointment in the Colonial Office, and\r\nthenceforth was able to devote all his time to politics and literary\r\nwork. Webb was at once elected chairman of the Technical Education\r\nBoard, which up to 1904 had the management of all the education in the\r\ncounty, other than elementary, which came under public control. The\r\nsaying is attributed to him that according to the Act of Parliament\r\nTechnical Education could be defined as any education above elementary\r\nexcept Greek and Theology, and the Board under his chairmanship--he was\r\nchairman for eight years--did much to bring secondary and university\r\neducation within the reach of the working people of London. From 1892\r\nonwards there was always a group of Fabians on the London County\r\nCouncil, working in close alliance with the \"Labour Bench,\" the Trade\r\nUnionists who then formed a group of the Progressive Party under the\r\nleadership of John Burns. Under this silent but effective influence the\r\npolicy of the Progressives was largely identical with the immediate\r\nmunicipal policy of the Society itself, and the members of the Society\r\ntook a keen and continuous interest in the triennial elections and the\r\nwork of the Council.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll this concern in local administration did not interfere with the\r\ninterest taken by the Society in parliamentary politics, and one\r\nillustration of this may be mentioned. The Liberal Party has a\r\ntraditional feud with Landlordism, and at this period its favourite\r\npanacea was Leasehold Enfranchisement, that is, the enactment of a law\r\nempowering leaseholders of houses built on land let for ninety-nine\r\nyears, the common practice in London, to purchase the freehold at a\r\nvaluation. Many Conservatives had come round to the view that the\r\nbreaking up of large town estates and the creation of numerous\r\nfreeholders, would strengthen the forces upholding the rights of\r\nproperty, and there was every prospect that the Bill would be passed. A\r\nfew hours before the debate on April 29th, 1891, a leaflet (Tract No.\r\n22) was published explaining the futility of the proposal from the\r\nFabian standpoint, and a copy was sent to every member of Parliament. To\r\nthe astonishment of the Liberal leaders a group of Radicals, including\r\nthe present Lord Haldane and Sir Edward Grey, opposed the Bill, and it\r\nwas defeated by the narrow majority of 13 in a house numbering 354. A\r\nfew years later the proposal was dropped out of the Liberal programme,\r\nand the Leasehold Enfranchisement Association itself adopted a new name\r\nand a revised policy.\r\n\r\nBut the main object of the Fabians was to force on the Liberal Party a\r\nprogramme of constructive social reform. With few exceptions their\r\nmembers belonged or had belonged to that party, and it was not\r\ndifficult, now that London had learned the value of the Progressive\r\npolicy, to get resolutions accepted by Liberal Associations demanding\r\nthe adoption of a programme. Sidney Webb in 1888 printed privately a\r\npaper entitled \"Wanted a Programme: An Appeal to the Liberal Party,\" and\r\nsent it out widely amongst the Liberal leaders. The \"Star\" and the\r\n\"Daily Chronicle\" took care to publish these resolutions, and everything\r\nwas done, which skilful agitators knew, to make a popular demand for a\r\nsocial reform programme. We did what all active politicians in a\r\ndemocratic country must do; we decided what the people ought to want,\r\nand endeavoured to do two things, which after all are much the same\r\nthing, to make the people want it, and to make it appear that they\r\nwanted it. The result--how largely attributable to our efforts can\r\nhardly now be estimated--was the Newcastle Program, reluctantly blessed\r\nby Mr. Gladstone and adopted by the National Liberal Federation in\r\n1891.[28]\r\n\r\nThe General Election of 1892 was anticipated with vivid interest. Since\r\nthe election of 1886 English Socialism had come into being and Trade\r\nUnionism had been transformed by the rise of the Dockers, and the other\r\n\"new\" unions of unskilled labour. But a Labour Party was still in the\r\nfuture, and our Election Manifesto (Tract 40), issued in June, bluntly\r\ntells the working classes that until they form a party of their own they\r\nwill have to choose between the parties belonging to the other classes.\r\nThe Manifesto, written by Bernard Shaw, is a brilliant essay on labour\r\nin politics and a criticism of both the existing parties; it assures\r\nthe working classes that they could create their own party if they cared\r\nas much about politics as they cared for horse-racing (football was not\r\nin those days the typical sport); and it concludes by advising them to\r\nvote for the better, or against the worse, man, on the ground that\r\nprogress was made by steps, a step forward was better than a step\r\nbackward, and the only thing certain is the defeat of a party which\r\nsulks and does not vote at all. The Manifesto was widely circulated by\r\nthe then vigorous local societies, and no doubt had some effect, though\r\nthe intensity of the antipathy to Liberal Unionism on the one side and\r\nto Home Rule on the other left little chance for other considerations.\r\n\r\nSix members of the Society were candidates, but none of them belonged to\r\nthe group which had made its policy and conducted its campaign. In one\r\ncase, Ben Tillett at West Bradford, the Society took an active part in\r\nthe election, sending speakers and collecting £152 for the Returning\r\nOfficer's expenses. Of the six, J. Keir Hardie at West Ham alone was\r\nsuccessful, but Tillett did well at West Bradford, polling 2,749, only a\r\nfew hundred votes below the other two candidates, and preparing the\r\nfield for the harvest which F.W. Jowett reaped in 1906.\r\n\r\nThe result of the election, which took place in July, was regarded as a\r\njustification for the Fabian policy of social advance. In London, where\r\nLiberalism was strongly tainted with it, the result was \"as in 1885,\"\r\nthe year of Liberal victory, and the only Liberal seat lost was that of\r\nthe President of the Leasehold Enfranchisement Association! In the\r\nindustrial cities, and in Scotland, where Liberalism was still\r\nindividualist, the result was rather as in 1886, when Liberalism lost.\r\nIn London also \"by far the largest majorities were secured by Mr. John\r\nBurns and Mr. Keir Hardie, who stood as avowed Socialists, and by Mr.\r\nSydney Buxton, whose views are really scarcely less advanced than\r\ntheirs.\"[29]\r\n\r\nI have pointed out that Fabian policy began with State Socialism, and in\r\nquite early days added to it Municipal Socialism; but in 1888 the\r\nauthors of \"Fabian Essays\" appeared to be unconscious of Trade Unionism\r\nand hostile to the Co-operative movement. The Dock Strike of 1889 and\r\nthe lecturing in London clubs and to the artisans of the north pointed\r\nthe way to a new development. Moreover, in the summer of 1892 Sidney\r\nWebb had married Miss Beatrice Potter, author of an epoch-making little\r\nbook, \"The Co-operative Movement,\" and together they were at work on\r\ntheir famous \"History of Trade Unionism.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Questions\" for local governing bodies issued in 1892 were full of\r\nsuch matters as fair wages, shorter hours, and proper conditions for\r\nlabour, and it was speedily discovered that this line of advance was the\r\nbest suited to Fabian tactics because it was a series of skirmishes all\r\nover the country, in which scores and hundreds could take part. Each\r\nlocality had then or soon afterwards three or four elected local\r\ncouncils, and hardly any Fabian from one end of the country to the other\r\nwould be unable in one way or another to strike a blow or lift a finger\r\nfor the improvement of the conditions of publicly employed labour.\r\n\r\nBut the Government of Mr. Gladstone had not been in office for much more\r\nthan a year before a much more ambitious enterprise on this line was\r\nundertaken. In March, 1893, Sir Henry (then Mr.) Campbell-Bannerman had\r\npledged the Government to \"show themselves to be the best employers of\r\nlabour in the country\": \"we have ceased,\" he said, \"to believe in what\r\nare known as competition or starvation wages.\" That was a satisfactory\r\npromise, but enunciating a principle is one thing and carrying it into\r\neffect in scores of departments is another. Mr. Gladstone, of course,\r\nwas interested only in Home Rule. Permanent officials doubtless\r\nobstructed, as they usually do: and but a few members of the Cabinet\r\naccepted or understood the new obligation. The Fabian Society knew the\r\nGovernment departments from the inside, and it was easy for the\r\nExecutive to ascertain how labour was treated under each chief, what he\r\nhad done and what he had left undone. At that time legislative reforms\r\nwere difficult because the Government majority was both small and\r\nuncertain, whilst the whole time of Parliament was occupied by the\r\nnecessary but futile struggle to pass a Home Rule Bill for the Lords to\r\ndestroy. But administrative reforms were subject to no such limitations:\r\nwages and conditions of labour were determined by the department\r\nconcerned, and each minister could do what he chose for the workmen\r\nvirtually in his employment, except perhaps in the few cases, such as\r\nthe Post Office, where the sums involved were very large, when the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer had the same opportunity.\r\n\r\nBernard Shaw and Sidney Webb then decided that the time had come to make\r\nan attack on old-fashioned Liberalism on these lines. The \"Fortnightly\r\nReview\" accepted their paper, the Society gave the necessary sanction,\r\nand in November the article entitled \"To Your Tents, O Israel\" appeared.\r\nEach of the great departments of the State was examined in detail, and\r\nfor each was stated precisely what should be done to carry out the\r\npromise that the Government would be \"in the first flight of employers,\"\r\nand what in fact had been done, which indeed, with rare exceptions, was\r\nnothing. The \"Parish Councils Act\" and Sir William Harcourt's great\r\nBudget of 1894 were still in the future, and so far there was little to\r\nshow as results from the Liberal victory of the previous year. The case\r\nagainst the Government from the Labour standpoint was therefore\r\nunrelieved black, and the Society, in whose name the Manifesto appeared,\r\ncalled on the working classes to abandon Liberalism, to form a Trade\r\nUnion party of their own, to raise £30,000 and to finance fifty\r\ncandidates for Parliament. It is a curious coincidence that thirteen\r\nyears later, in 1906, the Party formed, as the Manifesto demanded, by\r\nthe big Trade Unions actually financed precisely fifty candidates and\r\nsucceeded in electing thirty of them.\r\n\r\nThe Manifesto led to the resignation of a few distinguished members,\r\nincluding Professor D.G. Ritchie, Mrs. Bateson, widow of the Master of\r\nSt. John's College, Cambridge, and more important than all the rest, Mr.\r\nH.W. Massingham. He was on the Continent when the Manifesto was in\r\npreparation; otherwise perhaps he might have come to accept it: for his\r\nreply, which was published in the same magazine a month later, was\r\nlittle more than a restatement of the case. \"The only sound\r\ninterpretation of a model employer,\" he said, \"is a man who pays trade\r\nunion rates of wages, observes trade union limit of hours, and deals\r\nwith 'fair' as opposed to 'unfair' houses. Apply all these tests and the\r\nGovernment unquestionably breaks down on every one of them.\" If this was\r\nall that an apologist for the Government could say, no wonder that the\r\nattack went home. The opponents of Home Rule were of course delighted to\r\nfind another weak spot in their adversary's defences; and the episode\r\nwas not soon forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn January the article was reprinted with much additional matter\r\ndrafted by Bernard Shaw. He showed in considerable detail how a Labour\r\nParty ought to be formed, and how, in fact, it was formed seven years\r\nlater. With our numerous and still flourishing local societies, and the\r\nnewly formed I.L.P., a large circulation for the tract was easily\r\nsecured. Thousands of working-class politicians read and remembered it,\r\nand it cannot be doubted that the \"Plan of Campaign for Labour,\" as it\r\nwas called, did much to prepare the ground for the Labour Party which\r\nwas founded so easily and flourished so vigorously in the first years of\r\nthe twentieth century.\r\n\r\nAt this point the policy of simple permeation of the Liberal Party may\r\nbe said to have come to an end. The \"Daily Chronicle,\" under the\r\ninfluence of Mr. Massingham, became bitterly hostile to the Fabians.\r\nThey could no longer plausibly pretend that they looked for the\r\nrealisation of their immediate aims through Liberalism. They still\r\npermeated, of course, since they made no attempt to form a party of\r\ntheir own, and they believed that only through existing organisations,\r\nTrade Unions on one side, the political parties on the other, could\r\nsufficient force be obtained to make progress within a reasonable time.\r\nIn one respect it must be confessed we shared an almost universal\r\ndelusion. When the Liberal Party was crushed at the election of 1895 we\r\nthought that its end had come in England as it has in other countries.\r\nConservatism is intelligible: Socialism we regarded as entirely\r\nreasonable. Between the two there seemed to be no logical resting place.\r\nWe had discovered long ago that the working classes were not going to\r\nrush into Socialism, but they appeared to be and were in fact growing up\r\nto it. The Liberalism of the decade 1895-1905 had measures in its\r\nprogramme, such as Irish Home Rule, but it had no policy, and it seemed\r\nincredible then, as it seems astonishing now, that a party with so\r\nlittle to offer could sweep the country, as it was swept by the Liberals\r\nin 1906. But nobody could have foreseen Mr. Lloyd George, and although\r\nthe victory of 1906 was not due to his leadership, no one can doubt that\r\nit is his vigorous initiative in the direction of Socialism which\r\nsecured for his party the renewed confidence of the country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwelve years later another attempt to get administrative reform from the\r\nLiberal Party was made on somewhat similar lines. The party had taken\r\noffice in December, 1905, and in the interval before the General\r\nElection of 1906 gave them their unprecedented majority, \"An Intercepted\r\nLetter,\" adopted at a members' meeting in December, was published in the\r\n\"National Review\" for January. It purported to be a circular letter\r\naddressed by the Prime Minister to his newly appointed colleagues,\r\ngiving each of them in turn advice how to run his department. In this\r\ncase there was no necessity to suggest administrative reforms only. The\r\nLiberals were certain of a majority, and they had no programme: they\r\nwere bound to win, not on their merits, but on the defects of their\r\nopponents. The Letter, written by Webb in a rollicking style, to which\r\nhe rarely condescends, touched on each of the great departments of\r\nGovernment, and advocated both the old policy of Trade Union hours and\r\nwages, for which the new Prime Minister had made himself in 1893\r\npersonally responsible, but also all sorts of progressive measures,\r\ngraduated and differentiated income-tax for the Treasury, Compulsory\r\nArbitration in Labour Disputes for the Home Office--we discovered the\r\nflaw in that project later--reform of Grants in Aid for the Local\r\nGovernment Board, Wages Boards for Agriculture, and so on. A few weeks\r\nlater the country had the General Election to think about, and the\r\nLetter was merely reprinted for private circulation amongst the members\r\nof the Society. But we took care that the new Ministers read it, and it\r\nserved to remind them of the demands which, after the election, the\r\nLabour Party, at last in being, would not let them again forget.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] Bernard Shaw has sent me the following note on this paragraph:--\r\n\r\nOne London group incident should be immortalized. It was in the W.C.\r\ngroup, which met in Gt. Ormond St. It consisted of two or three members\r\nwho used to discuss bi-metallism. I was a member geographically, but\r\nnever attended. One day I saw on the notice of meetings which I received\r\nan announcement that Samuel Butler would address the group on the\r\nauthorship of the Odyssey. Knowing that the group would have no notion\r\nof how great a man they were entertaining, I dashed down to the meeting;\r\ntook the chair; gave the audience (about five strong including Butler\r\nand myself) to understand that the occasion was a great one; and when we\r\nhad listened gravely to Samuel's demonstration that the Odyssey was\r\nwritten by Nausicaa, carried a general expression of enthusiastic\r\nagreement with Butler, who thanked us with old-fashioned gravity and\r\nwithdrew without giving a sign of his feelings at finding so small a\r\nmeeting of the famous Fabian Society. Considering how extraordinary a\r\nman Butler is now seen to have been, there is something tragic in the\r\nfact that the greatest genius among the long list of respectable\r\ndullards who have addressed us, never got beyond this absurd little\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n[27] Tract 41. \"The Fabian Society,\" p. 18.\r\n\r\n[28] Bernard Shaw has sent me the following note on this point:--\r\n\r\nThe exact facts of the launching of the Newcastle Program are these.\r\nWebb gave me the Program in his own handwriting as a string of\r\nresolutions. I, being then a permeative Fabian on the executive of the\r\nSouth St. Pancras Liberal and Radical Association (I had coolly walked\r\nin and demanded to be elected to the Association and Executive, which\r\nwas done on the spot by the astonished Association--ten strong or\r\nthereabouts) took them down to a meeting in Percy Hall, Percy Street,\r\nTottenham Court Road, where the late Mr. Beale, then Liberal candidate\r\nand subscription milch cow of the constituency (without the ghost of a\r\nchance), was to address as many of the ten as might turn up under the\r\nimpression that he was addressing a public meeting. There were certainly\r\nnot 20 present, perhaps not 10. I asked him to move the resolutions. He\r\nsaid they looked complicated, and that if I would move them he would\r\nsecond them. I moved them, turning over Webb's pages by batches and not\r\nreading most of them. Mr. Beale seconded. Passed unanimously. That night\r\nthey went down to The Star with a report of an admirable speech which\r\nMr. Beale was supposed to have delivered. Next day he found the National\r\nLiberal Club in an uproar at his revolutionary break-away. But he played\r\nup; buttoned his coat determinedly; said we lived in progressive times\r\nand must move with them; and carried it off. Then he took the report of\r\nhis speech to the United States and delivered several addresses founded\r\non it with great success. He died shortly after his last inevitable\r\ndefeat. He was an amiable and worthy man; and the devotion with which he\r\nfought so many forlorn hopes for his party should have earned him a safe\r\nseat. But that debt was never paid or even acknowledged; and he felt the\r\ningratitude very keenly.\r\n\r\n[29] \"Fabian News,\" August, 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\n\"Fabianism and the Empire\": 1900-1\r\n\r\n   The Library and Book Boxes--Parish Councils--The Workmen's\r\n   Compensation Act--The Hutchinson Trust--The London School of\r\n   Economics--Educational Lectures--Electoral Policy--The controversy\r\n   over the South African War--The publication of \"Fabianism and the\r\n   Empire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next few years were devoted to quieter work than that of the period\r\ndescribed in the previous chapter. The Conservative Party was in power,\r\nLiberalism, which had lost its great leader, and a year or two later\r\nlost also his successor, Lord Rosebery, was in so hopeless a minority\r\nthat its return to power in the near future seemed to be and was\r\nimpossible. It had been easy to permeate the Liberals, because most of\r\nour members were or had been connected with their party. It was\r\nimpossible to permeate Conservatism on similar lines, both because we\r\nwere not in touch with their organisation and because Conservatives in\r\ngeneral regarded our proposals with complete aversion. It was a time,\r\ntherefore, for educational rather than political activity, and to this\r\nthe Society devoted the greater part of its energies. Its work in this\r\nfield took various forms, some of which may be briefly described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Emery Walker_\r\n\r\nG. BERNARD SHAW, IN 1889]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had started a lending library in boxes for our local societies, and\r\nas these died away we offered the use of it to working-class\r\norganisations, and indeed to any organisation of readers or students.\r\nBooks were purchased from special funds, a collection of some 5000\r\nvolumes was ultimately formed, and for the last twenty years the Society\r\nhas kept in circulation anything up to 200 boxes of books on Socialism,\r\neconomics, history and social problems, which are lent for ten shillings\r\na year to Co-operative Societies, Trade Unions, Socialist Societies, and\r\nmiscellaneous organisations. The books are intended to be educational\r\nrather than directly propagandist, and each box is made up to suit the\r\ntaste, expressed or inferred, of the subscriber. Quarterly exchanges are\r\nallowed, but the twenty or thirty books in a box usually last a society\r\nfor a year. It is a remarkable fact that although boxes are lent freely\r\nto such slight organisations as reading classes, and are sent even to\r\nremote mining villages in Wales or Scotland, not a single box has ever\r\nbeen lost. Delays are frequent: books of course are often missing, but\r\nsooner or later every box sent out has been returned to the Society.\r\n\r\nAnother method of securing the circulation of good books on social\r\nsubjects has been frequently used. We prepare a list of recent and\r\nimportant publications treating of social problems and request each\r\nmember to report how many of them are in the Public Library of his\r\ndistrict, and further to apply for the purchase of such as are absent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Local Government Act of 1894, commonly called the Parish Councils\r\nAct, which constituted out of chaos a system of local government for\r\nrural England, gave the Society an opportunity for practising that part\r\nof its policy which includes the making the best use of all forms of\r\nexisting legislation. Mr. Herbert Samuel was at that time a friend,\r\nthough he was never a member, of the Society, and the first step in his\r\nsuccessful political career was his candidature for the typically rural\r\nSouthern Division of Oxfordshire. He was good enough to prepare for us\r\nnot only an admirable explanation of the Act, but also Questions for\r\nParish Councillors, for Rural District Councillors, and for Urban\r\nDistrict Councillors. Probably this was the first time that an analysis\r\nof a new Act of Parliament had been published at a penny. Anyway the\r\ndemand for it was considerable, and over 30,000 copies were sold in five\r\nmonths. Then it was revised, with the omission of temporary matter, and\r\nrepublished as \"Parish and District Councils: What they are and what\r\nthey can do,\" and in this form has gone through many editions, and is\r\nstill in print. The tract states that the secretary of the Society will\r\ngive advice on any obscure point in the law, and in this way the Society\r\nhas become an Information Bureau; hardly a week passed for many years\r\nafter the autumn of 1895 without a letter from some village or small\r\ntown asking questions as to housing, common rights, charities, the\r\nduties of chairmen of councils, the qualifications of candidates, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nSimilar tracts were published describing the powers and duties of the\r\nLondon County Council, the London Vestries, and the Metropolitan Borough\r\nCouncils, established in 1899, while one giving the powers of various\r\nlocal authorities for housing (No. 76, \"Houses for the People\") has gone\r\nthrough many editions and still has a steady sale.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Workmen's Compensation Act, 1897, afforded another opportunity for\r\nthis sort of work. Our penny tract (No. 82) describing the rights of the\r\nworkmen under the Act was reprinted thirteen times in eight months, and\r\nover 120,000 were sold in the first year of publication. This tract\r\noffered free advice to every purchaser, and the result has been an\r\nenormous amount of correspondence which during seventeen years has never\r\nentirely ceased. This work of providing expert advice on minor legal\r\nmatters has been a quiet service to the community constantly rendered by\r\nthe Society. The barristers amongst our members have freely given\r\nassistance in the more difficult matters. Occasionally the solicitors\r\namongst us have taken up cases where the plaintiff was specially\r\nhelpless.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1894, Henry Hutchinson, who had provided the funds for much of our\r\ncountry lecturing, died, and to our complete surprise it was found that\r\nhe had appointed Sidney Webb, whom he hardly knew personally, his\r\nexecutor, and had left the residue of his estate, between £9000 and\r\n£10,000, to five trustees--Sidney Webb, his daughter, myself, William\r\nClarke, and W.S. De Mattos--with directions that the whole sum be\r\nexpended within ten years. The two last named took but little part in\r\nadministering the trust, and Miss Hutchinson died only fifteen months\r\nlater, also leaving to her colleagues the residue of her estate,\r\nsomething under £1000, for similar purposes. The trustees--Mrs. Bernard\r\nShaw, Hubert Bland, and Frederick Whelen were appointed at later\r\ndates--resolved that the money in their charge should be used\r\nexclusively for special work, as otherwise the effect would be merely to\r\nrelieve the members of their obligation to pay for the maintenance of\r\ntheir Society. They decided to devote part of the funds to initiating\r\nthe London School of Economics and Political Science, because they\r\nconsidered that a thorough knowledge of these sciences was a necessity\r\nfor people concerned in social reconstruction, if that reconstruction\r\nwas to be carried out with prudence and wisdom: and in particular it was\r\nessential that all classes of public officials should have the\r\nopportunity of learning whatever can be known of economics and politics\r\ntaught on modern lines. Our old Universities provided lectures on\r\npolitical science as it was understood by Plato and Aristotle, by Hobbes\r\nand Bentham: they did not then--and indeed they do not now--teach how\r\nNew Zealand deals with strikes, how America legislates about trusts, how\r\nmunicipalities all over the world organise tramways.\r\n\r\nThe trustees, as I have said, originated the London School of Economics,\r\nbut from the first they associated others with themselves in its\r\nmanagement, and they made no attempt to retain any special share in its\r\ncontrol. Their object was to get taught the best science that could be\r\nobtained, confident that if their own political theories were right,\r\nscience would confirm them, and if they were wrong, it was better that\r\nthey should be discredited. The London School of Economics, though thus\r\nfounded, has never had any direct or organic connection with the Fabian\r\nSociety, and therefore any further account of its successful career\r\nwould be out of place in this volume. But it may be said that it has\r\ncertainly more than justified the hopes of its founders, or rather, to\r\nbe accurate, I should say, founder, since the other trustees were wholly\r\nguided by the initiative of Sidney Webb.\r\n\r\nBesides the School, and the Library connected with it, the Trust\r\npromoted for many years regular courses of Fabian educational lectures\r\non social and political subjects, such as Socialism, Trade Unionism,\r\nCo-operation, Poor Law, Economics, and Economic History. Lecturers were\r\nselected with care, and were in some cases given a maintenance allowance\r\nduring the preparation of their lectures. Then arrangements were made\r\nfor courses of four lectures each, on what may be called University\r\nExtension lines, in four or five centres in one part of the country. For\r\nexample, in the year 1896-7 180 lectures were given in fifty towns, half\r\nof them under the auspices of branches of the I.L.P., and the rest\r\norganised by Co-operative Societies, Liberal Associations, Trade Unions,\r\nand other bodies. Very careful syllabuses were prepared and widely\r\ncirculated, and the whole scheme was intended to be educational rather\r\nthan directly propagandist. The first lecturers engaged were J. Ramsay\r\nMacdonald and Miss Enid Stacy, whose premature death, a few years after\r\nher marriage to the Rev. Percy Widdrington, was a great loss to the\r\nmovement. This lecturing was maintained for many years. In 1900, shortly\r\nafter the creation there of County and District Councils, we\r\nexperimented upon Ireland, where J. Bruce Glasier and S.D. Shallard gave\r\na number of courses of lectures, without any very obvious results. In\r\n1902 W. Stephen Sanders took over the work, but the fund was coming to\r\nan end, and after 1904 subsidised lecturing virtually ceased.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn order to help working-class students who had the desire to study more\r\ncontinuously than by attendance at lectures, correspondence classes were\r\nstarted in the same class of subject as the lectures. A textbook was\r\nselected and divided into sections, to each of which an introduction was\r\nwritten, concluding with questions. Written answers were sent in and\r\ncorrected by the conductor of the class. This went on regularly until\r\n1900, when Ruskin College, Oxford, organised similar classes on a larger\r\nscale, and our services were no longer required.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn August, 1896, the triennial International Socialist Workers and Trade\r\nUnion Congress was held in London, at which the Society was represented\r\nby a numerous delegation. The chief business proved to be the expulsion\r\nof the Anarchists, who at this period attended these conferences and had\r\nto be got rid of before the appointed business could be carried on. The\r\nSociety prepared an important \"Report\" for circulation at the Congress,\r\none part of it advocating various reforms, no longer of any special\r\ninterest, and the other part consisting of a summary of the principles\r\nand policy of the Society, drafted by Bernard Shaw in a series of\r\nepigrammatic paragraphs. This document, still circulated as Tract 70, is\r\ninteresting both as a brief and vivid exposition of Fabianism and\r\nbecause it gave rise to another of the long series of fights on the\r\npolicy of political toleration. The passage chiefly objected to,\r\nwritten, of course, for foreigners, and therefore more detailed than\r\notherwise would be necessary, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"FABIAN ELECTORAL TACTICS.\r\n\r\n   \"The Fabian Society does not claim to be the people of England, or\r\n   even the Socialist party, and therefore does not seek direct\r\n   political representation by putting forward Fabian candidates at\r\n   elections. But it loses no opportunity of influencing elections, and\r\n   inducing constituencies to select Socialists as their candidates. No\r\n   person, however, can obtain the support of the Fabian Society or\r\n   escape its opposition, merely by calling himself a Socialist or\r\n   Social-Democrat. As there is no Second Ballot in England, frivolous\r\n   candidatures give great offence and discredit the party in whose name\r\n   they are undertaken, because any third candidate who is not well\r\n   supported will not only be beaten himself but may also involve in his\r\n   defeat the better of the two candidates competing with him. Under\r\n   such circumstances the Fabian Society throws its weight against the\r\n   third candidate, whether he calls himself a Socialist or not, in\r\n   order to secure the victory to the better of the two candidates\r\n   between whom the contest really lies. But when the third candidate is\r\n   not only a serious representative of Socialism, but can organise his\r\n   party well and is likely to poll sufficient votes to make even his\r\n   defeat a respectable demonstration of the strength and growth of\r\n   Socialism in the constituency, the Fabian Society supports him\r\n   resolutely under all circumstances and against all other parties.\"\r\n\r\nThis was an extreme statement of our position, because the Society has\r\nnever, so far as I am aware, taken any action which could be described\r\nas \"throwing its weight against\" a third candidate in a parliamentary\r\nelection. But it represented our policy as it might have been, if\r\noccasion had arisen to carry it to its logical conclusion.\r\n\r\nIt was opposed, not because it was an inaccurate statement of fact, but\r\nbecause a minority of the Society desired to change the policy it\r\ndescribed; and after the Congress was over an influential requisition\r\nwas got up by J. Ramsay Macdonald, who had been elected to the Executive\r\nCommittee in 1894, demanding that the tract be withdrawn from\r\ncirculation. The battle was joined at Clifford's Inn in October, and the\r\ninsurgents were defeated, after an exciting discussion, by 108 to 33.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is little to record of the years that followed. Graham Wallas, who\r\nhad been elected to the London School Board in 1894, resigned his seat\r\non the Executive in 1895; Bernard Shaw became a St. Pancras Vestryman\r\nwithout a contest in 1897, an event rather of literary[30] than\r\npolitical significance, and in 1898 he had a serious illness which kept\r\nhim out of the movement for nearly two years; whilst at the end of 1899\r\nSydney Olivier was appointed Colonial Secretary of Jamaica, and spent\r\nmost of the next fourteen years in the West Indies, latterly as Governor\r\nof Jamaica, until 1913, when he was recalled to London to be the\r\nSecretary of the Board of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nExternal events put an end to this period of quiescence, and the\r\nSociety, which was often derisively regarded as expert in the politics\r\nof the parish pump, an exponent of \"gas and water Socialism,\" was forced\r\nto consider its attitude towards the problems of Imperialism.\r\n\r\nWar was declared by President Kruger for the South African Republic on\r\nOctober 11th, 1899. Up to this point the whole of the Society, with very\r\nfew exceptions, had scouted the idea of war. \"The grievances alleged,\r\nthough some of them were real enough, were ludicrously unimportant in\r\ncomparison with our cognate home grievances. Nobody in his senses would\r\nhave contemplated a war on their account,\"[31] But when war had come the\r\nsituation was entirely altered. The majority of the Society recognised\r\nthat the British Empire had to win the war, and that no other conclusion\r\nto it was possible. Some of us had joined in the protest against the\r\nthreat of war: but when that protest was fruitless we declined to\r\ncontest the inevitable. A large section of the Liberal Party and nearly\r\nall other Socialists took another view. They appeared to believe, and\r\nsome of them even hoped, that the Boers might be successful and the\r\nBritish army be driven to the sea. The I.L.P. regarded the war as a\r\ntypical case of the then accepted theory of Socialism that war is always\r\ninstigated by capitalists for the purpose of obtaining profits. They\r\nopposed every step in the prosecution of the campaign, and criticised\r\nevery action of the British authorities.\r\n\r\nIn this matter the left and right wings of the Fabians joined hands in\r\nopposition to the centre. Members who came into the movement when\r\nMarxism was supreme, like Walter Crane, those who worked largely with\r\nthe I.L.P., such as J. Ramsay Macdonald, S.G. Hobson, and G.N. Barnes\r\n(later M.P. and Chairman of the Labour Party), were joined by others who\r\nwere then associated with the Liberals, such as Dr. F. Lawson Dodd, Will\r\nCrooks (later Labour M.P.), Clement Edwards (later Liberal M.P.), and\r\nDr. John Clifford. On the other side were the older leaders of the\r\nSociety, who took the view that the members had come together for the\r\npurpose of promoting Socialism, that the question at issue was one\r\n\"which Socialism cannot solve and does not touch,\"[32] and that whilst\r\neach member was entitled to hold and work for his own opinion, it was\r\nnot necessary for the Society in its corporate capacity to adopt a\r\nformal policy with the result of excluding the large minority which\r\nwould have objected to whatever decision was arrived at.\r\n\r\nThe first round in the contest was at a business meeting on October\r\n13th, 1899, when on the advice of the Executive the members present\r\nrejected a motion of urgency for the discussion of a resolution\r\nexpressing sympathy with the Boers.\r\n\r\nIt was however agreed that the matter could not end thus, and a members'\r\nmeeting was fixed for December 8th, at Clifford's Inn Hall, when S.G.\r\nHobson moved a long resolution declaring it essential that the attitude\r\nof the Society in regard to the war should be clearly asserted, and\r\nconcluding: \"The Fabian Society therefore formally dissociates itself\r\nfrom the Imperialism of Capitalism and vainglorious Nationalism and\r\npledges itself to support the expansion of the Empire only in so far as\r\nit may be compatible with the expansion of that higher social\r\norganisation which this Society was founded to promote.\"\r\n\r\nBernard Shaw, on behalf of the Executive Committee, moved a long\r\nreasoned amendment declaring that a parliamentary vote was not worth\r\nfighting about, demanding that at the conclusion of the war measures be\r\ntaken for securing the value of the Transvaal mines for the public, and\r\nthat the interests of the miners be safeguarded. The amendment was\r\nbarely relevant to the issue, and notwithstanding influential support it\r\nwas defeated by 58 to 27. Thereupon the \"previous question\" was moved\r\nand carried by 59 to 50. This inconclusive result revealed a great\r\ndiversity of opinion in the Society, and the Executive Committee, for\r\nthe first and, so far, the only time, availed itself of the rule which\r\nauthorised it to submit any question to a postal referendum of all the\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThe question submitted in February, 1900, was this: \"Are you in favour\r\nof an official pronouncement being made now by the Fabian Society on\r\nImperialism in relation to the War?\" and on the paper published in the\r\n\"News\" were printed four reasons on one side and five on the other,\r\ndrafted by those members of the Executive who advocated each policy. On\r\nthe one hand it was argued that the Society should resist aggressive\r\ncapitalism and militarism, thus putting itself into line with\r\ninternational socialism, and that expenditure on the war would postpone\r\nsocial reform. On the other it was contended that the question was\r\noutside the province of the Society, that a resolution by the Society\r\nwould carry no weight, would not stop the war, and might have a serious\r\neffect on the solidarity of the Society itself. The vote excited great\r\ninterest: an appeal to the electorate to vote Yes, worded with much\r\nmoderation, was issued by Walter Crane, S.G. Hobson, Charles\r\nCharrington, F. Lawson Dodd, J. Frederick Green, George N. Barnes, Will\r\nCrooks, Henry S. Salt, Dr. John Clifford, Mrs. Mallet, Clement Edwards,\r\nMrs. J.R. Macdonald and others; to which a reply was sent, signed only\r\nby members of the Executive, Bernard Shaw, Sidney Webb, Hubert Bland,\r\nJ.F. Oakeshott, H.W. Macrosty and one or two others. Finally a rejoinder\r\nby the signatories of the first circular was issued in the course of the\r\npoll which extended over nearly a month. The membership at the time was\r\nabout 800, of whom 50 lived abroad, and in all only 476 votes were cast,\r\n217 in favour of a pronouncement and 259 against.\r\n\r\nIt was said at the time, and has constantly been alleged since, that the\r\nSociety had voted its approval of the South African War and had\r\nsupported imperialist aggression and anti-democratic militarism. As will\r\nbe seen from the foregoing, no such statement is correct. A vote on the\r\npolicy of the Government would have given an overwhelming adverse\r\nmajority, but it would have destroyed the Society. In early days we had\r\ndrawn a clear line between Socialism and politics: we had put on one\r\nside such problems as Home Rule and Church Disestablishment as of the\r\nnature of red herrings, matters of no real importance in comparison with\r\nthe economic enfranchisement which we advocated. In the early eighties\r\nParliament spent futile and fruitless months discussing whether Mr.\r\nBradlaugh should take the oath, and whether an extension of the\r\nfranchise should or should not be accompanied by redistribution. We\r\nwanted to make the working classes pay less attention to these party\r\nquestions and more attention to their own social conditions. We thought,\r\nor at any rate said, that the Liberal and Conservative leaders kept the\r\nparty ball rolling in order to distract the workers from the iniquity of\r\nthe distribution of wealth. We insisted that Socialism was an economic\r\ndoctrine, and had nothing to do with other problems. Later on we\r\nrealised that the form of government is scarcely less important than its\r\ncontent: that the unit of administration, whether imperial, national, or\r\nlocal, is germane to the question of the services to be administered;\r\nthat if the governmental machine is to be used for industry, that\r\nmachine must be modern and efficient: and that in fact no clear line of\r\ndistinction can be drawn between the problems of constitutional\r\nstructure which concern Socialism and those, if any, which do not\r\nconcern it. In the case of the South African war it was mainly the\r\ninstinct of self-preservation that actuated us; it is certain that any\r\nother decision would have destroyed the Society. The passions of that\r\nperiod were extraordinarily bitter. The Pro-Boers were mobbed and howled\r\ndown, their actions were misrepresented, and their motives disparaged:\r\nthey retaliated by accusing the British troops of incredible atrocities,\r\nby rejoicing over every disaster which befell our arms, and by\r\nprophesying all sorts of calamities however the war ended. There was\r\nnever any question of the Society issuing a pronouncement justifying\r\nthe war. Only a very few of our members went as far as that. But many\r\nothers, all or nearly all who were now beginning to be called the \"old\r\ngang,\" on whom from first to last the initiative and stability of the\r\nSociety has depended, would have declined to be associated with what\r\nthey regarded as the anti-patriotic excesses of certain of the Liberals,\r\nand would have resigned their membership, or at any rate their official\r\npositions in the Society, had it adopted at that time the same policy as\r\nthe I.L.P. Happily tolerance prevailed, and although an attempt was made\r\nto get up a big secession, only about fifteen members resigned in a\r\ngroup when the result of the poll was declared. These, however, included\r\na few important names, J. Ramsay Macdonald and J. Frederick Green, of\r\nthe Executive Committee, George N. Barnes and Pete Curran, future Labour\r\nMembers of Parliament, Walter Crane, H.S. Salt, Mrs. J.R. Macdonald, and\r\nMrs. Pankhurst.\r\n\r\nAt the election of the Executive Committee in April, 1900, the Society\r\nby another vote confirmed the previous decision. All the old members\r\nwere re-elected, and those of the majority party polled the heaviest\r\nvotes. The two seats vacated by resignation were filled by \"Pro-Boers,\"\r\nand the only new candidate who supported the majority was defeated. It\r\nwas clear, therefore, that the voting was not strictly on party\r\nlines--one of the opposition, Charles Charrington, was fourth on the\r\npoll--but that the Society as a whole approved of the non-committal\r\npolicy. The Executive Committee had been elected since 1894 by a postal\r\nballot of the whole Society, and on this occasion 509 members, over 62\r\nper cent of the whole, recorded their votes.\r\n\r\nThe Executive had resolved at the beginning of the war to issue a tract\r\non Imperialism, and at the Annual Meeting in May, 1900, a resolution\r\nwas passed that it prepare for submission to the members \"a constructive\r\ncriticism from the Socialist standpoint of the actions and programmes of\r\nthe various political parties.\"\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, Bernard Shaw undertook the difficult job, for at this\r\nperiod all the official pronouncements of the Executive were drafted by\r\nhim. At the beginning of September it was announced as nearly ready, and\r\nlater in the month a proof was sent to every member for criticism, and a\r\nmeeting was called for the 25th to discuss it. This was the extreme\r\nexample of the practice at that time habitual, of inviting the\r\nco-operation of every member in our publications. No less than 134\r\nmembers returned amended proofs or wrote letters of criticism; and it is\r\nrecorded that only one of these was opposed to the whole thing, whilst\r\nonly nine preferred to have no manifesto at all; and another nine\r\nobjected to material portions. The great majority were cordial in\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nBernard Shaw is fond of posing as the most conceited of persons, but\r\nthose who have had to do with him in literary matters are aware that no\r\npose was ever more preposterous. When he has acted as the literary\r\nexpert of the Fabian Society he has considered every criticism with\r\nunruffled courtesy, and dealt with the many fools who always find their\r\nway into extreme parties, not according to their folly, but with the\r\ncareful consideration properly accorded to eminent wisdom. The business\r\nof examining over a hundred marked proofs of a document of 20,000 words,\r\nevery line of which was more or less controversial, was an immense one,\r\nbut the author gave every criticism its proper weight, and accepted\r\nevery useful amendment. Then came the meeting. It was held at Clifford's\r\nInn, and between 130 and 140 members were present, each of whom was\r\nentitled to move any amendment on any of the 20,000 words, or any\r\naddition to or deletion of them. Nearly three hours were occupied partly\r\nin discussing the controversial portion and partly with the general\r\nquestion of publication. Only eighteen voted for omitting the part about\r\nImperialism, and the minority against the publication numbered no more\r\nthan fourteen. By this time the controversy over the war had reached an\r\nintensity which those who cannot recollect it will find difficult to\r\nbelieve, and nobody but the author could have written an effective\r\ndocument on the war so skilfully as to satisfy the great majority of the\r\nsupporters of both parties in the Society. Bernard Shaw has accomplished\r\nmany difficult feats, but none of them, in my opinion, excels that of\r\ndrafting for the Society and carrying through the manifesto called\r\n\"Fabianism and the Empire.\"\r\n\r\nIt was published as a shilling volume by Grant Richards, and although it\r\nwas widely and favourably noticed in the Press the sales were only\r\nmoderate, just over 2000 copies to the end of the year. Some time later\r\nthe Society purchased the remainder of 1500 copies at 1d. and since sold\r\nthem at prices, rising as the stock declined, up to five shillings a\r\ncopy!\r\n\r\nThe theme of the manifesto is the overriding claim of efficiency not\r\nonly in our own government, and in our empire, but throughout the world.\r\nThe earth belongs to mankind, and the only valid moral right to national\r\nas well as individual possession is that the occupier is making adequate\r\nuse of it for the benefit of the world community. \"The problem before us\r\nis how the world can be ordered by Great Powers of practically\r\ninternational extent.... The partition of the greater part of the globe\r\namong such powers is, as a matter of fact that must be faced approvingly\r\nor deploringly, now only a question of time\" (p. 3). \"The notion that a\r\nnation has a right to do what it pleases with its own territory, without\r\nreference to the interests of the rest of the world is no more tenable\r\nfrom the International Socialist point of view--that is, from the point\r\nof view of the twentieth century--than the notion that a landlord has a\r\nright to do what he likes with his estate without reference to the\r\ninterests of his neighbours.... [In China] we are asserting and\r\nenforcing international rights of travel and trade. But the right to\r\ntrade is a very comprehensive one: it involves a right to insist on a\r\nsettled government which can keep the peace and enforce agreements. When\r\na native government of this order is impossible, the foreign trading\r\npower must set one up\" (pp. 44-5). \"The value of a State to the world\r\nlies in the quality of its civilisation, not in the magnitude of its\r\narmaments.... There is therefore no question of the steam-rollering of\r\nlittle States because they are little, any more than of their\r\nmaintenance in deference to romantic nationalism. The State which\r\nobstructs international civilisation will have to go, be it big or\r\nlittle. That which advances it should be defended by all the Western\r\nPowers. Thus huge China and little Monaco may share the same fate,\r\nlittle Switzerland and the vast United States the same fortune\" (p. 46).\r\n\r\nAs for South Africa, \"however ignorantly [our] politicians may argue\r\nabout it, reviling one another from the one side as brigands, and\r\ndefending themselves from the other with quibbles about waste-paper\r\ntreaties and childish slanders against a brave enemy, the fact remains\r\nthat a Great Power, consciously or unconsciously, must govern in the\r\ninterests of civilisation as a whole; and it is not to those interests\r\nthat such mighty forces as gold-fields, and the formidable armaments\r\nthat can be built upon them, should be wielded irresponsibly by small\r\ncommunities of frontiersmen. Theoretically they should be\r\ninternationalised, not British-Imperialised; but until the Federation of\r\nthe World becomes an accomplished fact we must accept the most\r\nresponsible Imperial federations available as a substitute for it\" (pp.\r\n23-4).\r\n\r\nAs however the Manifesto was designed for the general election, this\r\ntheme was only sketched, and the greater part was occupied with matters\r\nof a more immediately practicable character. The proposed partition of\r\nChina at that time seemed imminent, and our attention had been called to\r\nthe efficiency of the German State organisation of foreign trade in\r\ncomparison with the _laissez-faire_ policy which dominated our Foreign\r\nOffice. We regarded our overseas trade as a national asset, and urged\r\nthat the consular service should be revolutionised. \"Any person who\r\nthinks this application of Socialism to foreign trade through the\r\nconsular system impossible also thinks the survival of his country in\r\nthe age of the Powers impossible. No German thinks it impossible. If he\r\nhas not already achieved it, he intends to\" (pp. 10, 11). We must \"have\r\nin every foreign market an organ of commercially disinterested\r\nindustrial intelligence. A developed consulate would be such an organ.\"\r\n\"The consulate could itself act as broker, if necessary, and have a\r\nrevenue from commissions, of which, however, the salaries of its\r\nofficials should be strictly independent\" (pp. 10 and 8).\r\n\r\nThe present army should be replaced \"by giving to the whole male\r\npopulation an effective training in the use of arms without removing\r\nthem from civil life. This can be done without conscription or barrack\r\nlife\" by extending the half-time system to the age of 21 and training\r\nthe young men in the other half. From the millions of men thus trained\r\n\"we could obtain by voluntary enlistment a picked professional force of\r\nengineers, artillery, and cavalry, and as large a garrison for outlying\r\nprovinces as we chose to pay for, if we made it attractive by the\r\nfollowing reforms\": full civil rights, a living wage, adequate\r\nsuperannuation after long service, and salaries for officers on the\r\ncivil scale. The other reforms advocated included a minimum wage for\r\nlabour, grants in aid for housing, freedom for municipal trading,\r\nmunicipal public-houses, and reorganisation of the machinery of\r\neducation, as explained later. \"The moral of it all is that what the\r\nBritish Empire wants most urgently in its government is not\r\nConservatism, not Liberalism, not Imperialism, but brains and political\r\nscience\" (p. 93).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAHAM WALLAS, IN 1891]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[30] Shaw has \"vehemently protested\" against this phrase, saying that he\r\n\"put in six years of hard committee work to the astonishment of the\r\nvestrymen who had not expected (him) to be a man of business and a\r\nsticker at it.\" But I am still of opinion that the secondary effects of\r\nthose six years on his knowledge of affairs and the lessons he has drawn\r\nfrom them in his writings and speeches have been of greater value to his\r\ninnumerable readers and hearers than was his administrative diligence to\r\nthe Parish of St. Pancras.\r\n\r\n[31] \"Fabianism and the Empire,\" p. 26.\r\n\r\n[32] \"The Fabian Society and the War: reply by the majority of the\r\nExecutive Committee to the recent circular.\" (Circular on the referendum\r\nmentioned later.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\nEducation: 1902-5, and the Labour Party: 1900-15\r\n\r\n   Housing--\"The Education muddle and the way out\"--Supporting the\r\n   Conservatives--The Education Acts of 1902 and 1903--Feeding School\r\n   Children--The Labour Representation Committee formed--The Fabian\r\n   Election Fund--Will Crooks elected in 1910--A Fabian Cabinet\r\n   Minister--Resignation of Graham Wallas--The younger generation: H.W.\r\n   Macrosty, J.F.

The office first taken,\r\nin 1891, was at 276 Strand, in the island at that time formed by\r\nHolywell Street which ran between the churches of St. Clement Danes and\r\nSt. Martin's in the Fields. At the end of 1899 the London County Council\r\nacquired the property for the Kingsway and Aldwych clearance scheme, and\r\nwe found new quarters in a basement at Clement's Inn, a pleasant couple\r\nof rooms, with plenty of light, though sometimes maliciously\r\nmisdescribed as a cellar. At the end of 1908 we removed into three much\r\nmore spacious rooms at the same address, also in \"a dismal basement,\"\r\nwhere we remained until in 1914 the Society rented a house at 25 Tothill\r\nStreet, Westminster.\r\n\r\nAnother undertaking was a conference on Housing. Although the first\r\npublic effort of the Society was its conference at South Place Chapel in\r\n1886, this particular form of propaganda has never commended itself to\r\nthe Executive, chiefly no doubt because conferences, to which numerous\r\nrepresentative persons are invited, are most useful for promoting\r\nmoderate reforms which have already made themselves acceptable to the\r\nmembers and officials of local governing bodies. Such reforms the Fabian\r\nSociety does not regard as its special business; it prefers to pioneer;\r\nit is true that it uses its machinery for spreading a knowledge of local\r\ngovernment in all its forms, but that is mainly a matter of office\r\nroutine.\r\n\r\nHowever, for once we took up an already popular proposal. The Housing of\r\nthe Working Classes Act of 1890 was an admirable measure, but it was\r\nhedged about with obstacles which rendered it very difficult to work in\r\nurban areas and virtually useless in rural districts. We had drafted an\r\namending Bill for rural districts in 1895, which was read a first time\r\nin the House of Commons on the day of the vote on the supply of cordite,\r\nwhen the defeat of the Liberal Government led to the dissolution of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1890 was singular in one respect. Part III was headed\r\n\"Working-Class Lodging Houses,\" and was drafted accordingly, but the\r\ndefinition of lodging-houses was made to include cottages with not more\r\nthan half an acre of garden, thus enabling houses to be provided by\r\nlocal authorities in town and country, apart from clearances of\r\ninsanitary areas. For years this definition was overlooked, and very few\r\npeople were aware that cottages could be built in rural districts by the\r\nGuardians, and later by Rural District Councils. Our Leaflet No. 63,\r\n\"Parish Council Cottages,\" issued in 1895, was almost the first\r\npublication drawing attention to the subject, and with one exception no\r\nuse was made of these powers of the Act in rural districts before that\r\nyear. Our Tract 76, \"Houses for the People,\" published in 1897,\r\nexplained the Act in simple language, and was widely circulated.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 an amending Act, chiefly to simplify procedure in rural\r\ndistricts, was promised by the Government; and the conference we called\r\nwas intended to agitate for widening its scope and strengthening its\r\nprovisions. The papers, read by Clement Edwards (afterwards M.P.), Miss\r\nConstance Cochrane, Alderman Thompson, and others, were first discussed\r\nat a preliminary private meeting in December, and then submitted to the\r\nConference, which was held on March 1st, the day following the\r\nConference at which the Labour Party was established. By choosing this\r\ndate we secured a large number of delegates from Trade Unions, and these\r\nwere reinforced by numerous delegates from Vestries and other local\r\nauthorities, altogether numbering about 400. At the close of the\r\nproceedings a National Committee was formed with headquarters at the\r\nFabian Office, which had however only a short career. The Conference\r\npapers were printed as a bulky penny tract, \"The House Famine and How to\r\nRelieve It,\" which rapidly went through two editions. We also published\r\n\"Cottage Plans and Common Sense,\" by Raymond Unwin, which describes how\r\ncottages should be built--an anticipation of garden suburbs and\r\ntown-planning--and a compilation of everything which Parish Councils had\r\ndone and could do, including housing, prepared by Sidney Webb and\r\ncalled \"Five Years' Fruits of the Parish Councils Act,\" which in 1908\r\nwas revised and reissued as \"Parish Councils and Village Life.\" A speech\r\nby W.C. Steadman, M.P., who was a member of the Society, was printed\r\nunder the title \"Overcrowding and Its Remedy.\" Our agitation was not\r\nwithout results. The amending Acts of 1900, 1903, and 1909 have done\r\nmuch to remove the unnecessary administrative complexities of the Act of\r\n1890, but in fact the problem is still unsolved, and the scandalous\r\ncharacter of our housing, both urban and rural, remains perhaps the\r\nblackest blot in the record of British civilisation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Society had always been concerned in public education. Its first\r\nelectoral success was when Mrs. Besant and the Rev. Stewart Headlam were\r\nelected to the London School Board in 1888, and except for one interval\r\nof three years Mr. Headlam has sat on the School Board and its\r\nsuccessor, the London County Council, ever since. Sidney Webb was\r\nChairman or Vice-Chairman of the L.C.C. Technical Education Board from\r\nits foundation in 1893, almost continuously until the Board came to an\r\nend in 1904, after the London Education Act. Graham Wallas was elected\r\nto the School Board in 1894, and from 1897 onwards was Chairman of the\r\nSchool Management Committee; he had been re-elected in 1900, and was\r\ntherefore filling the most important administrative position on the\r\nBoard when the Education question was before the Society.\r\n\r\nThe educational scheme of the Society was not, however, the joint\r\nproduction of its experts. It was entirely the work of Sidney Webb.\r\nHeadlam and Wallas, and the members who took part, contributed their\r\nshare as critics, but as critics only, and for the most part as hostile\r\ncritics. It was in part a struggle between the County Councils and the\r\nSchool Boards and in part a controversy over the denominational schools.\r\nWallas opposed our proposals in the main because he regarded them as\r\ntoo favourable to sectarian education: Headlam was against them on both\r\nissues. They put up a vigorous fight, but they were beaten every time in\r\nthe Society, as the defenders of School Boards were beaten ultimately in\r\nParliament and in the country.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the controversy was taken in May, 1899, when a\r\nMembers' Meeting was held to discuss \"The Education Muddle and the Way\r\nOut,\" in the form of sixteen resolutions, six on \"General Principles\"\r\nand the remainder on \"Immediate Practicable Proposals.\" These were\r\nintroduced by Webb, and the \"General Principles,\" advocating the\r\ntransfer of education to the local government authority and the\r\nabolition of School Boards, were adopted. Amendments by Graham Wallas\r\nwere defeated by large majorities, and the discussion on the second\r\npart, the immediately practicable proposals, was adjourned.\r\n\r\nAt the adjourned meeting in November, 1899, the resolutions were put\r\naside and a draft tract was submitted. Graham Wallas again led the\r\nopposition, which was always unsuccessful, though serious shortcomings\r\nin the proposals were revealed and it was agreed to meet the criticisms\r\nwherever possible. Finally it was decided to appoint a Revision\r\nCommittee, on which Wallas was placed. Thirteen months passed before the\r\nscheme came before the Society again; in December the tract as amended\r\nwas submitted, and this time the chief critic was Mr. Headlam. On the\r\nmain question of principle he found only one supporter, and with minor\r\namendments the scheme was adopted.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to describe the Fabian plan, because it is\r\nsubstantially the system of administration, established by the Act of\r\n1902, under which present-day education is organised. The main\r\ndifference is that we presented a revolutionary proposal in an\r\nextremely moderate form and Mr. Arthur Balfour found himself able to\r\ncarry out our principles more thoroughly than we thought practically\r\npossible. Our tract advocated the abolition of all School Boards, but\r\nanticipated, incorrectly, that those of the twenty or thirty largest\r\ncities would be too strong to be destroyed: and whilst insisting that\r\nthe public must find all the money required to keep the voluntary\r\nschools in full efficiency, we only proposed that this should take the\r\nform of a large grant by County Councils and County Boroughs, whilst Mr.\r\nBalfour was able to make the Councils shoulder the cost.\r\n\r\nHow far the draughtsmen of the Bill were influenced by the Fabian scheme\r\ncannot here be estimated, but the authorities at Whitehall were so\r\nanxious to see it that they were supplied with proofs before\r\npublication; and the tract when published was greedily devoured by\r\nperplexed M.P.'s.\r\n\r\nIt must be recollected that the whole complex machinery of educational\r\nadministration was in the melting-pot, and nobody knew what was to come\r\nout of it. It had been assumed by nearly everybody that education was a\r\ndepartment of local government which demanded for its management a\r\nspecial class of representatives. The Liberal Party was attached to\r\nSchool Boards, because their creation had been one of the great party\r\nvictories of Mr. Gladstone's greatest Government, because they embodied\r\na triumph over the Church and the virtual establishment of nonconformity\r\nin control of half the elementary schools of the country. Socialists and\r\nthe vague labour section took the same view partly because they believed\r\ntheoretically in direct election for all purposes and partly because the\r\ncumulative vote, intended to secure representation to minorities, gave\r\nthem better chances of success at the polls than they then had in any\r\nother local election. The Board schools, with ample funds derived from\r\nthe rates, were far better than the so-called voluntary schools; but\r\nmore than half the children of the nation were educated in these\r\nschools, under-staffed, ill-equipped, and on the average in all respects\r\ninefficient. Every year that passed turned out thus its quota of poorly\r\neducated children. Something had to be done at once to provide more\r\nmoney for these inferior schools. It might be better that they should be\r\nabolished and State schools everywhere supplied, but this was a counsel\r\nof perfection, and there was no time to wait for it. Then again the\r\ndistinction between elementary education for the poor, managed by School\r\nBoards and by the voluntary school authorities, and other education\r\ncontrolled and subsidised by Town and County Councils, was disastrous,\r\nthe more so since a recent legal decision (the Cockerton case) had\r\nrestricted the limits of School Board education more narrowly than ever.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of projects might have been proposed for solving these complex\r\ndifficulties, projects drafted in the interests of the Church or the\r\nNonconformists, the voluntary schools or the schools of the local\r\nauthorities: but, in fact, the scheme proposed by Mr. Balfour followed\r\nalmost precisely the lines laid down in our tract, which was published\r\nin January, 1901, and of which 20,000 copies were quickly circulated.\r\n\r\nAt the Annual Meeting in May, 1901, a resolution was adopted, in spite\r\nof the vigorous opposition of Mr. Headlam, welcoming the Government Bill\r\nand suggesting various amendments to it. This Bill was withdrawn, to be\r\nreintroduced a year later as the Education Bill, 1902, which ultimately\r\nbecame law. This measure was considered at a meeting in May, 1902, and a\r\nlong series of resolutions welcoming the Bill and advocating amendments\r\non eighteen different points was carried in spite of vigorous\r\nopposition. Nearly all these amendments, the chief of which was directed\r\nto making the Bill compulsory where it was drafted as optional, were\r\nembodied in the Act.\r\n\r\nOur support of the Conservative Government in their education policy\r\ncaused much surprise and attracted not a little attention. We had been\r\nsuspected by other Socialists, not without excuse, of intrigues with the\r\nLiberals, and our attack on that party in 1893 was made exclusively in\r\nthe interests of Labour. Now when Liberals and Labour were united in\r\ndenouncing the Government, when Nonconformists who had deserted\r\nLiberalism on the Home Rule issue were returning in thousands to their\r\nold party, the Fabians, alone amongst progressives (except of course the\r\nIrish, who were keen to save the Roman Catholic schools), supported the\r\nGovernment in what was popularly regarded as a reactionary policy. Time\r\nhas vindicated our judgment. The theological squabbles which occupied so\r\nmuch of the energies of the School Boards are now forgotten because the\r\nrival sects are no longer represented on the Education Authorities, that\r\nis, the town and county councils. Education has been secularised in the\r\nsense that it is no longer governed by clerics, and though some Liberals\r\nnow desire to carry Mr. Balfour's policy still further, the Liberal\r\nParty in its ten years of office has never been able to affect any\r\nfurther change.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1902 did not apply to London, and in the great province ruled\r\nby its County Council the case for maintaining the separate existence of\r\nthe School Board was stronger than anywhere else. The London County\r\nCouncil itself was unwilling to undertake elementary education, and the\r\nSchool Board, like all other bodies in such circumstances, vehemently\r\nobjected to its own dissolution. The Board was efficient; its schools\r\nwere excellent; there was no evidence that the already overburdened\r\nCounty Council could properly carry on the work. On the other hand, the\r\nFabian Society was in a stronger position. The Chairman of the Technical\r\nEducation Board was something more than a self-constituted authority on\r\nthe organisation of education: and the other members of the Society were\r\nengaged on a contest on their home ground. Into the details of the\r\nresolutions submitted to the Fabian Society outlining a plan for London\r\neducation it is needless now to enter, except to say that Graham Wallas\r\non this issue supported, without enthusiasm, the policy of the Society.\r\nMr. Balfour made no fewer than three attempts to solve the problem, each\r\ntime approaching more nearly to the plan prepared by the Fabian Society.\r\nOn the third and eventually successful Bill thirteen amendments were\r\nformulated by the Society, eleven of which were adopted by the House of\r\nCommons, and finally, to quote our Annual Report, \"the Act only departed\r\nfrom our plan by giving to the Borough Councils the appointment of\r\ntwo-thirds of the managers of provided schools, while we desired the\r\nproportion to be one-half, and omitting a proposal that the Education\r\nAuthority should have compulsory powers to acquire sites for schools\r\nother than elementary.\"\r\n\r\nOn the County Council itself, which was strongly opposed to the Bill,\r\nMr. Webb conducted a skilful and successful campaign to defeat a policy\r\nof passive resistance which might have led to endless difficulties. But\r\nthat is outside the history of the Fabian Society.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that the Society did not content itself with merely\r\npassing resolutions. All these documents were printed by thousands and\r\nposted to members of Parliament and of education authorities up and\r\ndown the country: our members incessantly lectured and debated at\r\nLiberal Associations and Clubs, and indefatigably worked the London and\r\nProvincial presses; none of the resources of skilful propagandists was\r\nneglected which might shake the opposition to the Bills, or convince\r\nsome of the Liberal and Labour opponents that for once at any rate a\r\ngood thing might come from the Conservative Party.\r\n\r\nThe transfer of the control of all elementary schools to the local\r\nauthorities rendered at last possible the public feeding of school\r\nchildren, long before advocated by the Social Democratic Federation.\r\nThis had hitherto been regarded by the Fabian Society as impracticable;\r\nthough an eloquent and often quoted passage in Graham Wallas's\r\ncontribution to \"Fabian Essays\" describes the schools of the future with\r\n\"associated meals [served] on tables spread with flowers, in halls\r\nsurrounded with beautiful pictures, or even, as John Milton proposed,\r\nfilled with the sound of music.\" Our contribution towards this ideal was\r\nTract No. 120, \"After Bread Education: a Plan for the State Feeding of\r\nSchool Children,\" published in 1905, one of the few tracts for which\r\nHubert Bland was largely responsible, which advocated a reform carried\r\ninto law a year later.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1893, and even before, the Fabian Society had urged the Trade\r\nUnionists to form a Labour Party of their own, and earlier in the same\r\nyear the Independent Labour Party had been founded which was originally\r\nintended to achieve the object indicated by its name, but which quickly\r\nbecame a purely Socialist society. It carried on a vigorous and\r\nsuccessful propaganda amongst Trade Unionists, with the result that in\r\n1899 the Trade Union Congress passed a resolution directing its\r\nParliamentary Committee, in co-operation with the Socialist Societies,\r\nto call a conference in order \"to devise ways and means for securing an\r\nincreased number of Labour members in the next Parliament.\" In\r\naccordance with this resolution the Society was invited to appoint two\r\nrepresentatives to meet the delegates of the Parliamentary Committee and\r\nof the two other Socialist organisations. Bernard Shaw and myself were\r\nappointed, and we took part in the business of arranging for the\r\nConference. This was held on the last two days of February, 1900, and I\r\nwas appointed the one delegate to which the Society was by its numbers\r\nentitled. The \"Labour Representation Committee\" was duly formed, and it\r\nwas decided that the Executive Committee of twelve should include one\r\nelected by the Fabian Society. This Committee was constituted then and\r\nthere, and, as \"Fabian News\" reports, \"Edward R. Pease provisionally\r\nappointed himself, as the only Fabian delegate, to be on the Executive\r\nCommittee, and the Executive Committee has since confirmed the\r\nappointment.\" This little comedy was carried on for some years. The\r\nFabian Society was only entitled to send one delegate to the annual\r\nconference, but that delegate had the right of electing one member to\r\nthe Executive Committee, and I was appointed by my Committee to serve in\r\nboth capacities. But the incident embodies a moral. The Trade Unionists\r\non the Committee represented in the earlier years about 100,000 members\r\neach: I then represented some 700. But although it was often proposed to\r\namend the constitution by giving every vote an equal value, the Trade\r\nUnion leaders always defended the over-representation of the Socialists\r\n(the I.L.P. were also over-represented, though their case was not so\r\nextreme) partly because the Labour Representation Committee was founded\r\nas a federation of Socialists and Trade Unionists, and partly because\r\nSocialist Societies, consisting exclusively of persons keenly concerned\r\nin politics, were entitled to larger representation per head of\r\nmembership than Unions which were primarily non-political. But when we\r\nremember how attractive to the average man are broad generalisations\r\nlike \"one vote one value,\" and how plausible a case could be made out\r\nagainst discrimination in favour of Socialist Societies, it has always\r\nseemed to me a remarkable example of the practical common sense of\r\norganised labour that the old constitution has been preserved, in fact\r\nthough not precisely in form, to the present day. By the present\r\nconstitution the \"Socialist Section\" elects three members to the\r\nExecutive from nominations sent in advance; but as the I.L.P. always\r\nmakes two nominations, and the Fabian Society one, the alteration of the\r\nrule has not in fact made any change, and the over-representation of\r\nthis section is of course undiminished.\r\n\r\nSix months after the Labour Representation Committee was formed the\r\nSociety adopted a project drafted by Mr. S.G. Hobson for a Labour\r\nMembers' Guarantee Fund, and circulated it amongst the Unions affiliated\r\nto the Committee. The proposal was submitted by its author on behalf of\r\nthe Society to the Labour Representation Conference of 1901, but an\r\namendment both approving of the scheme and declaring that the time was\r\nnot ripe for it was carried. A year later however the Conference\r\nunanimously agreed to establish its Parliamentary Fund by which salaries\r\nfor their M.P.'s were provided until Parliament itself undertook the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nFor several years after this the Fabian Society did not greatly concern\r\nitself with the Labour Party. I attended the Annual Conferences and took\r\na regular part in the work of the Executive Committee, but my\r\ncolleagues of the Fabian Society as a whole showed little interest in\r\nthe new body. In a sense, it was not in our line. Its object was to\r\npromote Labour Representation in Parliament, and the Fabian Society had\r\nnever run, and had never intended to run, candidates for Parliament or\r\nfor any local authority. We had made appeals for election funds on a\r\ngood many occasions and had succeeded once or twice in collecting\r\nsubstantial sums, but this was a very different matter from accepting\r\nresponsibility for a candidate and his election expenses. Therefore, for\r\na good while, we remained in a position of benevolent passivity.\r\n\r\nThe Labour Representation Committee was founded as a Group, not as a\r\nParty, and one of the two members elected under its auspices at the\r\nGeneral Election of 1900 ran as a Liberal. In 1903 it transformed itself\r\ninto a Party, and then began the somewhat strange anomaly that the\r\nFabian Society as a whole was affiliated to the Labour Party, whilst\r\nsome of its members were Liberal Members of Parliament. It is true that\r\nthe Trade Unions affiliated to the party were in the same position:\r\ntheir members also were sometimes official Liberals and even Liberal\r\nM.P.'s. The Labour Party itself never complained of the anomaly in the\r\nposition of the Society or questioned its collective loyalty. And the\r\nLiberals in our Society never took any action hostile to the Labour\r\nParty, or indeed, so far as I know, supported any of the proposals\r\noccasionally made that we should disaffiliate from it. These proposals\r\nalways came from \"Fabian reformers,\" the younger men who wanted to\r\ncreate a revolution in the Society. And so little was their policy\r\nmatured that in several cases the same member first tried to get the\r\nSociety to expel all members who worked with any party other than the\r\nLabour Party, and a short time later moved that the Society should\r\nleave the Labour Party altogether. Or perhaps it was the other way\r\nround. Logical consistency is usually incompatible with political\r\nsuccess: compromise runs smooth, whilst principle jams. But the lesser\r\nsort of critic, on the look out for a grievance, can always apply a\r\nprinciple to a compromise, point out that it does not fit, and that\r\ndifficulties may arise. In the case in question they have in fact rarely\r\narisen, and such as have occurred have been easily surmounted. It is not\r\nnecessary to record here all the proposals put forward from time to time\r\nthat the Society should disaffiliate from the Labour Party, or on the\r\nother hand, that it should expel, directly or indirectly, all members\r\nwho did not confine their political activities to co-operating with the\r\nLabour Party. It may be assumed that one or other of these proposals was\r\nmade every few years after the Labour Party was constituted, and that in\r\nevery case it was defeated, as a rule, by a substantial majority.\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party won three remarkable victories in the period between\r\nthe General Election of 1900 and that of 1906. In 1902 Mr. David\r\nShackleton was returned unopposed for a Liberal seat, the Clitheroe\r\nDivision of Lancashire; in 1903 Mr. (now the Right Hon.) Will Crooks, an\r\nold member of our Society, captured Woolwich from the Conservatives by a\r\nmajority of 3229, amidst a scene of enthusiasm which none who were\r\npresent will ever forget: and five months later Mr. (now the Right Hon.)\r\nArthur Henderson, who later became a member of our Society, beat both\r\nLiberal and Tory opponents at the Barnard Castle Division of Durham.\r\n\r\nWhen the election campaign of 1906 began the Labour Party put fifty\r\ncandidates into the field and succeeded in carrying no fewer than\r\ntwenty-nine of them, whilst another joined the party after his\r\nelection. Four of these were members of the Fabian Society, and in\r\naddition three Fabians were successful as Liberals, including Percy\r\nAlden, then a member of our Executive Committee.\r\n\r\nWhilst the election was in progress Mr. H.G. Wells began the Fabian\r\nreform movement which is described in the next chapter. At that time he\r\ndid not bring the Labour Party into his scheme of reconstruction, but\r\nsome of the members of his Committee were then ardent adherents of that\r\nparty, and they persuaded his Committee to report in favour of the\r\nSociety's choosing \"in harmonious co-operation with other Socialist and\r\nLabour bodies, Parliamentary Candidates of its own. Constituencies for\r\nsuch candidates should be selected, a special election fund raised and\r\nelection campaigns organised.\"\r\n\r\nThe result was that a resolution proposed by the Executive Committee was\r\ncarried early in March, 1907, directing the appointment of a Committee\r\nto report on \"the best means of promoting local Socialist societies of\r\nthe Fabian type with the object of increasing Socialist representation\r\nin Parliament as a party co-operating as far as possible with the Labour\r\nParty whilst remaining independent of that and of all other Parties.\"\r\n\r\nThis, it will be observed, is a different proposition, and one which\r\nresulted in a lot of talk and nothing else. Bernard Shaw had the idea\r\nthat there might be county constituencies in the South of England, where\r\nindependent middle-class Socialists could win when Labour candidates had\r\nno chance. No such constituency has ever been discovered and the Fabian\r\nscheme has never even begun to be realised.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1908, the Committee's Report was considered and adopted, the\r\nimportant item being the decision to send a circular to every member\r\ninviting promises to an election fund of at least £5,000, contributions\r\nto be spread over five years. This ultimately resulted in promises\r\namounting to £2637--a much larger sum than the Society had ever had at\r\nits command--and with this substantial fund in prospect the Society was\r\nin a position to begin the business of electioneering.\r\n\r\nA favourable opportunity soon presented itself. A vacancy at the little\r\ntown of Taunton was not to be fought by the Liberals, while the\r\nConservative candidate, the Hon. W. (now Viscount) Peel, was a London\r\nCounty Councillor, bitterly opposed even to the mild collectivism of the\r\nLondon Progressives, Frank Smith, a member both of the Society and the\r\nLondon County Council, was willing to fight, the Labour Party Executive\r\ncordially approved, and the members promptly paid up the first\r\ninstalment of their promises. The election cost £316, of which the\r\nSociety paid £275, and although our candidate was beaten by 1976 votes\r\nto 1085, the result was not contrary to our anticipations.\r\n\r\nDuring 1909 the Executive Committee resolved to run two candidates, both\r\nalready nominated by the I.L.P., who willingly transferred to us the\r\nresponsibility for their election expenses. W. Stephen Sanders had been\r\nthird on the poll out of six candidates who fought in 1906 for the two\r\nseats at Portsmouth, and as he had polled 8172 votes, more than either\r\nConservative, it was reasonably hoped that the Liberals would leave one\r\nof the seats to him. Harry Snell at Huddersfield was opposing both\r\nparties, but had a fair chance of winning. At the General Election of\r\nJanuary, 1910, neither of these candidates was successful, Sanders,\r\nopposed by Lord Charles Beresford with an irresistible shipbuilding\r\nprogramme, only obtaining 3529 votes, whilst at Huddersfield Snell was\r\nsecond on the poll, but 1472 behind the Liberal. Elsewhere, however, the\r\nmembers of the Society did well, no less than eight securing seats, four\r\nfor the Labour Party and four as Liberals.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1910, we won our first electoral victory. Will Crooks had\r\nlost his seat at Woolwich in January by 295 votes. It was decided to\r\ntake over his candidature from the Coopers' Union, a very small society\r\nwhich only nominally financed it, and also to support Harry Snell again\r\nat Huddersfield. Will Crooks was victorious by 236 votes, but Harry\r\nSnell failed to reduce the Liberal majority. Elsewhere members of the\r\nSociety were very successful. In all eight secured seats for the Labour\r\nParty and four for the Liberals, amongst the latter Mr. (now Sir) L.G.\r\nChiozza Money, then a member of the Executive Committee.\r\n\r\nThis brings the electoral record of the Society up to the present time,\r\nexcept that it should be mentioned that Mr. Arthur Henderson, M.P., who\r\nbecame a member of the Society in 1912, was in 1915 both Secretary of\r\nthe Labour Party Executive and Chairman of the party in the House of\r\nCommons, until he relinquished the latter position on joining the\r\nCoalition Cabinet as Minister for Education, being thus actually the\r\nfirst member of a Socialist society to attain Cabinet rank in this\r\ncountry during his membership.\r\n\r\nDuring these later years the Fabian Society with its increased numbers\r\nwas entitled to several delegates at the annual conference of the Labour\r\nParty, and it frequently took part in the business by putting motions or\r\namendments on the agenda paper. All talk of forming a Fabian Socialist\r\nParty had died away, and the Executive Committee had shown itself far\r\nmore appreciative of the importance of the Labour Party than in earlier\r\nyears. I continued to represent the Society on the Executive Committee\r\nuntil the end of 1913, when I retired, and the new General Secretary, W.\r\nStephen Sanders, took my place. When in December, 1915, he accepted a\r\ncommission for the period of the war, as a recruiting officer, Sidney\r\nWebb was appointed to fill the vacancy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe account of the part taken by the Society in the work of the Labour\r\nParty has carried us far beyond the period previously described, and a\r\nshort space must now be devoted to the years which intervened between\r\nthe Education episode and the outburst of activity to be described in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\nSocial progress advances in waves, and outbursts of energy are always\r\nsucceeded by depressions. Up to 1899 the Society slowly grew in\r\nmembership until this reached 861. Then it slowly declined to 730 in\r\n1904. This was symptomatic of a general lack of interest in Socialism.\r\nThe lectures and meetings were poorly attended, and the really important\r\ndebates which decided our educational policy were conducted by only a\r\nfew dozen members. Twenty years had passed since the Society was\r\nfounded. Of the Essayists Bernard Shaw, Sidney Webb, Hubert Bland, and\r\nwhen in England, Sydney Olivier were still leaders of the Society, and\r\nso until January, 1904, was Graham Wallas, who then resigned his\r\nmembership on account of his disagreement with the tract on Tariff\r\nReform, but really, as his letter published in \"Fabian News\" indicated,\r\nbecause in the long controversy over education policy he had found\r\nhimself constantly in the position of a hostile critic. It should be\r\nadded that his resignation has been followed by none of those personal\r\nand political disagreements which so commonly accompany the severance of\r\nold associations. Mr. Wallas has remained a Fabian in all except name.\r\nHis friendship with his old colleagues has been unbroken, and he has\r\nalways been willing to assist the Society out of his abundant stores of\r\nspecial knowledge both by lecturing at its meetings and by taking part\r\nin conferences and even by attending quite small meetings of special\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nIn all these years a large number of younger members had come forward,\r\nnone of them of quite the same calibre as the Essayists, but many of\r\nthem contributing much to the sum total of the Society's influence. Of\r\nthese perhaps the most active was Henry W. Macrosty,[33] who sat on the\r\nExecutive from 1895 till 1907, when he retired on account of the\r\npressure of official duties. During and indeed before his period of\r\noffice Mr. Macrosty was constantly engaged in research and writing for\r\nthe Society. He prepared the Eight Hours Bill which approached nearest\r\nto practicability (Tract 48, \"Eight Hours by Law,\" 1893); in 1898 he\r\nwrote for the Society \"State Arbitration and the Living Wage\" (Tract\r\n83); in 1899, Tract 88, \"The Growth of Monopoly in English Industry\"; in\r\n1905 \"The Revival of Agriculture, a national policy for Great Britain,\"\r\nthe last named an extraordinarily farsighted anticipation of the chief\r\nreforms which were advocated with such vigour by the Liberal Party, and\r\nindeed by all parties in the years preceding the great war. In the same\r\nyear his \"State Control of Trusts\" was published as Tract 124. As I have\r\nbefore explained, a great part of the published work of the Society has\r\nbeen prepared co-operatively, and in this process Mr. Macrosty always\r\ntook an active part. He had a considerable share in drafting the\r\ninnumerable documents issued in connection with the education\r\ncontroversy, and indeed participated in all the activities of the\r\nExecutive until his retirement.\r\n\r\nScarcely less active was Joseph F. Oakeshott, who has been already\r\nmentioned in connection with the Fellowship of the New Life. He joined\r\nthe Executive when it was first enlarged in 1890, and sat until 1902. A\r\nSomerset House official, like Macrosty, he was strong on statistics, and\r\nfor many years he undertook the constant revisions of the figures of\r\nnational income, in the various editions of our \"Facts for Socialists,\"\r\n\r\nHis \"Democratic Budget\" (Tract 39) was our first attempt to apply\r\nSocialism to taxation: and his \"Humanising of the Poor Law\" (Tract 54),\r\npublished in 1894, set out the policy which in recent years has been\r\nwidely adopted by the better Boards of Guardians.\r\n\r\nJohn W. Martin sat on the Executive from 1894 to 1899, wrote Tract No.\r\n52, \"State Education at Home and Abroad\" (1894), and did a lot of\r\nvaluable lecturing, both here and in America, where he married the\r\nleading exponent of Fabianism and editor of a monthly called \"The\r\nAmerican Fabian,\" and, settling in New York, has since, under the name\r\nof John Martin, played a considerable part in the educational and\r\nprogressive politics of his adopted city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI will conclude this chapter with a short account of some of the\r\napplications of Socialism to particular problems which were studied by\r\nthe Society in or about this period of its history.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 and 1898 a good deal of time was devoted to working out a scheme\r\nfor the municipalisation of the Drink Trade. This was before the\r\npublication of \"The Temperance Problem and Social Reform,\" by Joseph\r\nRowntree and Arthur Sherwell, in 1899, a volume which was the first to\r\ntreat the subject scientifically on a large scale. I took the lead on\r\nthe question, and finally two tracts were published in 1898, \"Liquor\r\nLicensing at Home and Abroad\" (No. 85), giving a sketch of the facts,\r\nand \"Municipal Drink Traffic\" (No. 86), which set out a scheme drafted\r\nby me, but substantially modified as the result of discussions by the\r\nExecutive Committee and by meetings of members. This is one of the few\r\ncauses taken up by the Society which has made but little progress in\r\npopular favour in the seventeen years that have elapsed since we adopted\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOld Age Pensions, proposed in 1890 by Sidney Webb in Tract 17, \"Reform\r\nof the Poor Law,\" was definitely advocated in Tract No. 73, \"The Case\r\nfor State Pensions in Old Age,\" written in 1896 by George Turner, one of\r\nthe cleverest of the younger members. The Society did not make itself\r\nresponsible for the scheme he proposed, universal pensions for all, and\r\nthe Old Age Pensions Act of 1908 adopted another plan.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 and 1900 we devoted much time to the working out of further\r\nschemes of municipalisation in the form of a series of leaflets, Nos. 90\r\nto 97. We applied the principle to Milk, Pawnshops, Slaughterhouses,\r\nBakeries, Fire Insurance, and Steamboats. These were written by various\r\nmembers, and are all careful little studies of the subject, but they\r\nwere not issued in a convenient form, and none of the schemes advocated\r\nhas yet been generally carried out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Tariff Reform agitation could not pass unnoticed, and for a time\r\nBernard Shaw showed a certain inclination to toy with it. A tract\r\nadvocating Free Trade was actually set up, but got no further. Finally\r\nShaw drafted \"Fabianism and the Fiscal Question An Alternative Policy\"\r\n(Tract 116), which we adopted with practical unanimity, though it was\r\nthe occasion of the resignation of Graham Wallas.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps the least successful of the many pronouncements written\r\nby Bernard Shaw on behalf of the Society. A subtle and argumentative\r\ncriticism of Mr. Chamberlain's policy on one side and of the Free Trade\r\nrejoinder on the other is neither simple nor decisive enough for the\r\ngeneral reader: and the alternatives advocated--reorganisation of the\r\nconsular service in the interests of export trade, free ocean transit\r\nfor the purpose of consolidating the Empire and nationalisation of\r\nrailways as a necessary corollary together with improved technical\r\neducation--were too futurist, and appealed directly to too small and\r\nconservative a class, to attract much attention in the heat of a vital\r\ncontroversy. The writer had no anticipation of the triumph of\r\nLiberalism, then so near, and Evidently expected that Mr. Chamberlain\r\nwould carry the country for his policy. The tract was also issued in a\r\nshilling edition on superior paper with a preface by the author, and it\r\nis the only one of his publications which has failed to sell freely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt this period we had a number of Committees appointed to investigate\r\nvarious problems, and one of them, which had for its reference the\r\nBirth-rate and Infant Mortality, produced a report of more that\r\ntemporary significance. When the Society was formed the Malthusian\r\nhypothesis held the field unchallenged and the stock argument against\r\nSocialism was that it would lead to universal misery by removing the\r\nbeneficent checks on the growth of population, imposed by starvation\r\nand disease upon the lowest stratum of society. Since the year 1876 the\r\nbirth-rate had declined, and gradually the fear of over-population,\r\nwhich had saddened the lives of such men as John Stuart Mill, began to\r\ngive way to the much less terrifying but still substantial fear of\r\nunder-population, caused either by race degeneracy or race suicide. At\r\nthat period the former of the two was the accepted explanation, and only\r\nby vague hints did scientific statisticians indicate that there might be\r\nor perhaps must be something else than \"natural\" causes for the decline.\r\nTo the Society it seemed an all-important question. Was our race to\r\nperish by sterility, and if so, was sterility due to wealth and luxury\r\nor to poverty and disease? Or was the cause of the decline a voluntary\r\nlimitation of families? We determined, as a first step, to form some\r\nsort of statistical estimate of the extent of voluntary restriction. We\r\nthought, and, as the event proved, thought rightly, that our members\r\nwould be willing to assist us in this delicate enquiry. They were a\r\nsample of the population, selected in a manner which bore no sort of\r\nrelation to the question at issue, and if we could get returns from them\r\nindicating their personal practice in the matter, we might have some\r\nclue to the facts. It turned out that the result was far more startling\r\nand far more conclusive than we suspected.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1905, carefully drafted enquiry forms were sent out to all\r\nmembers of the Society except unmarried women, so arranged as to allow\r\nexact answers to be given to the questions without disclosure of the\r\nname or handwriting of the deponent. Of the 634 posted 460 were returned\r\nor accounted for, and only two members signified objection to the\r\nenquiry. After deduction of bachelors and others not relevant, we\r\nobtained particulars of 316 marriages. I prepared an elaborate\r\nstatistical report, which showed that in the period 1890-1899 out of 120\r\nmarriages only 6 fertile marriages were recorded in which no restriction\r\nhad been adopted. This was the first and possibly is the only\r\nstatistical enquiry yet made on the subject, and although the number of\r\ncases was minute in proportion to the population, the evidence afforded\r\nby that sample was sufficient to be conclusive, that at any rate a\r\ncause, and probably the chief cause, of the fall in the birth-rate was\r\nvoluntary limitation of families.\r\n\r\nThe method of publication presented some difficulty, and finally it was\r\ndecided, in order to secure the most generally impressive publicity, to\r\nask Sidney Webb to collect the other available evidence and to make an\r\narticle out of the whole, to be published over his name. It appeared as\r\ntwo special articles in \"The Times\" for October 11th and 18th, 1906, and\r\nwas subsequently reprinted by us as Tract 131, \"The Decline of the\r\nBirth-rate.\"\r\n\r\nOther Committees at this period discussed Agriculture, Poor Law, Local\r\nGovernment Areas, Public Control of Electricity, and Feeding of School\r\nChildren. Reports on all these subjects were issued as tracts, some of\r\nwhich have been mentioned already in connection with their authors, H.W.\r\nMacrosty and Hubert Bland, whilst others will be referred to in a future\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a copyright photograph by Lambert Weston and Son,\r\nFolkestone_\r\n\r\nH.G. WELLS, IN 1908 At the door of his house at Sandgate]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] Born 1865. Clerk in the Exchequer and Audit Dept. 1884, Assistant\r\nDirector of the Census of Production 1908. Author of \"Trusts and the\r\nState\" (1901) and \"The Trust Movement in British Industry\" (1907).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\nThe Episode of Mr. Wells: 1906-8\r\n\r\n   His lecture on administrative areas--\"Faults of the Fabian\"--The\r\n   Enquiry Committee--The Report, and the Reply--The real issue, Wells\r\n   v. Shaw--The women intervene--The Basis altered--The new\r\n   Executive--Mr. Wells withdraws--His work for Socialism--The writing\r\n   of Fabian Tracts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long controversy introduced by Mr. H.G. Wells attracted much public\r\nattention to the Fabian Society, added greatly to its numbers, and for a\r\ntime made it more of a popular institution than it had been before or\r\nhas been since. But, in fact, its main permanent interest arises from\r\nthe persons who played the leading parts. The real question at issue was\r\none neither of Socialist theory nor of Socialist policy. In so far as\r\nthese entered in, Mr. Wells preached to willing listeners, and the only\r\ndifference of opinion was as to the relative stress to be laid on\r\nparticular points. When the episode was over, the chief change made in\r\nFabian policy was one which Mr. Wells did not initiate, and which as\r\nsoon as it was actually adopted he virtually repudiated.[34] The\r\nsubstance of the controversy was whether the members desired to hand\r\nover their Society to be managed by Mr. Wells alone, or whether they\r\npreferred to retain their old leaders and only to accept Mr. Wells as\r\none amongst the rest.\r\n\r\nMr. Wells became a member in February, 1903, and in March gave his first\r\nlecture to the Society on a very technical subject, \"The Question of\r\nScientific Administrative Areas in Relation to Municipal Undertakings,\"\r\na paper subsequently published as an appendix to \"Mankind in the\r\nMaking.\"\r\n\r\nIt was probably his first appearance on a public platform; and as a\r\nlecture it was by no means a success, because he read his paper in a low\r\nmonotonous voice, addressed to a corner of the hall. If Mr. Wells had\r\nbeen by nature or practice as effective in speaking as he is in writing\r\nthe fate of the Fabian Society might have been different. He was\r\nseverely handicapped in his contest with the skilled debaters of the\r\n\"Old Gang,\" and though after a short time he learnt the art up to a\r\npoint, he was never really at home on a platform, and since the Fabian\r\nepisode he has confined himself for the most part to controversy in\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nThe next contribution of Mr. Wells to Fabian propaganda was on January\r\n12th, 1906. This date had been fixed for his paper next referred to, but\r\nin view of the General Election then in progress he read in its place\r\nhis admirable article entitled \"This Misery of Boots,\" which was\r\nsubsequently issued as a special Fabian publication.\r\n\r\nOn February 9th the great controversy began by the paper entitled\r\n\"Faults of the Fabian,\" read by Mr. Wells to a members' meeting, and\r\nsubsequently issued as a private document to all the members of the\r\nSociety. It was couched altogether in a friendly tone, expressed cordial\r\nappreciation of the record of the Society, but criticised it for lack of\r\nimaginative megalomania. It was \"still half a drawing-room society,\"\r\nlodged in \"an underground apartment,\" or \"cellar,\" with one secretary\r\nand one assistant. \"The first of the faults of the Fabian, then, is that\r\nit is small, and the second that strikes me is that, even for its\r\nsmallness, it is needlessly poor.\" The task undertaken by the Fabians\r\n\"is nothing less than the alteration of the economic basis of society.\r\nMeasure with your eye this little meeting, this little hall: look at\r\nthat little stall of not very powerful tracts: think of the scattered\r\nmembers, one here, one there.... Then go out into the Strand. Note the\r\nsize of the buildings and business places, note the glare of the\r\nadvertisements, note the abundance of traffic and the multitude of\r\npeople.... That is the world whose very foundations you are attempting\r\nto change. How does this little dribble of activities look then?\"\r\n\r\nThe paper goes on to complain that the Society did not advertise itself,\r\nmade the election of new members difficult, and maintained a Basis\r\n\"ill-written and old-fashioned, harsh and bad in tone, assertive and\r\nunwise.\" The self-effacive habits and insidious methods of the Society\r\nwere next criticised, and the writer exclaimed, \"Make Socialists and you\r\nwill achieve Socialism; there is no other plan.\" The history of the\r\nFabian motto was made use of to enforce the view that victory can only\r\nbe gained by straight fighters like Scipio, whilst Fabius, however\r\nsuccessful at first, ended his career as a stumbling-block to progress.\r\nTo effect the desired expansion the writer proposed to raise an income\r\nof £1000 a year, to increase the staff, to prepare literature for the\r\nconversion of unbelievers, and to get a number of young men and women,\r\nsome paid and some unpaid, to carry on the propaganda and the\r\nadministrative work. \"Unless I am the most unsubstantial of dreamers,\r\nsuch a propaganda as I am now putting before you ought to carry our\r\nnumbers up towards ten thousand within a year or so of its\r\ncommencement.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of the meeting it was unanimously agreed \"that the\r\nExecutive Committee be instructed to appoint a Committee consisting of\r\nmembers and non-members of the Executive to consider what measures\r\nshould be taken to increase the scope, influence, income, and activity\r\nof the Society.\" Further, a temporary amendment was made to the rules\r\ndeferring the Annual Meeting and Executive election until after the\r\nCommittee had reported.\r\n\r\n\"The Executive Committee,\" says \"Fabian News,\" \"was of opinion that a\r\nlarge Committee including both the Executive and an equal number of\r\nunofficial members should be appointed. But as Mr. Wells, the author of\r\nthe proposal, was resolutely opposed to this plan, the Executive decided\r\nthat in the circumstances it was best to fall in with his wishes, and\r\nthey accordingly appointed only those members, both Executive and other,\r\nwhom Mr. Wells nominated and who were willing to serve.\"\r\n\r\nThe Committee thus appointed consisted of the Rev. Stewart Headlam, Mrs.\r\nBernard Shaw, and G.R.S. Taylor of the Executive; Dr. Stanton Coit, W.A.\r\nColegate, Dr. Haden Guest, Sydney Olivier, Mrs. Pember Reeves, H.G.\r\nWells, and Mrs. Wells.\r\n\r\nThe Committee held its first sitting on February 28th, but its report\r\nwas not completed and presented to the Executive until the following\r\nOctober, Mr. Wells having in the interval visited the United States.\r\n\r\n\"Faults of the Fabian,\" written before the election of 1906, gave little\r\nindication that its author anticipated the sudden outburst of interest\r\nin Socialism which followed the astonishing success of the Labour Party\r\nat the polls. When Keir Hardie was chosen as leader of the party, it was\r\nrecognised that Socialism was no longer the creed of a few fanatics, but\r\na political force supported, actively or passively, by the great\r\norganisations of Labour throughout the country, able to fight, and\r\nsometimes to beat both the older parties. A new era in politics had\r\nbegun. The Tories had been defeated before by Mr. Gladstone's unrivalled\r\npersonality. Now they were defeated, as they had not been for\r\nthree-quarters of a century, by a party none of whose leaders possessed\r\nan outstanding personality, and by a programme which contained no item\r\nwith any popular appeal. Everybody was thinking and talking politics;\r\nevery political conversation began or ended with that unknown factor,\r\nthe new Labour Party; every discussion of the Labour Party involved a\r\ndiscussion of Socialism.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Mr. Wells with the intuition of genius in fact foresaw what was\r\nabout to happen: perhaps it was only chance. Anyway his proposal for an\r\nenlarged and invigorated society came at the precise moment, when the\r\nrealisation of his project was in fact possible; and, of course, his own\r\nvigorous and interesting personality attracted many to us who might have\r\nmoved in other directions, or indeed never have moved at all.\r\n\r\nThe inner history of the Wells Committee has never been revealed, but\r\nthe composition of the Committee indicates the probable truth of the\r\nrumours that the meetings were anything but dull, though in the end the\r\nCommittee arrived at an unanimous report. Sydney Olivier was one of the\r\n\"old gang,\" though at that time a vigorous supporter of all sorts of\r\nchanges. Mr. Headlam has always stood at the extreme right of the\r\nmovement, and in party politics has never abated his loyalty to\r\nLiberalism. Mr. G.R.S. Taylor and Dr. Haden Guest were at that time\r\neager adherents of the Labour Party, and Dr. Coit, who had just fought\r\nan election for the Party, no doubt took the same line. Mrs. Shaw by\r\nhabit and Mrs. Reeves by instinct belonged to the government rather than\r\nto the opposition: and Mr. Colegate, a judicious person, then quite\r\nyoung, doubtless inclined to the same side. Last but not least, Mr.\r\nWells himself, then as always mercurial in his opinions, but none the\r\nless intensely opinionated, and unable to believe that anybody could\r\nhonestly differ from him, was by himself sufficient to disturb the\r\nharmony of any committee.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wells acted as secretary, and the Committee took evidence from\r\nmyself and others before the report was drawn up.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Committee is a much less inspiring document than the\r\nirresponsible and entertaining \"Faults of the Fabian.\" It was largely\r\nconcerned with a number of administrative details. New books and \"short\r\nreadable tracts\" were to be written, and the format of our publications\r\nwas to be changed. Groups were to be revived in all localities (to be\r\ncalled \"Wandsworth 1, Wandsworth 2, Wandsworth 3,\" and so on), together\r\nwith Head-quarters groups, also numbered 1, 2, 3, etc. This perhaps is\r\nthe chief remaining trace of the megalomania of the original scheme, and\r\nis hidden away in an appendix: all our efforts never yielded Wandsworth\r\nNo. 1, let alone the others! A fixed minimum subscription payable on a\r\nfixed date and a list of subscriptions to be published annually were\r\nfurther suggestions. The rule of the Society had been and is to the\r\ncontrary in both particulars. \"Fabian News\" was to be enlarged into a\r\nweekly review addressed to the public, a change which would have\r\nrequired an editorial staff and extensive new offices. A publications\r\neditor was to be appointed who would be able to publish, or to arrange\r\nfor the publication of, such books as Mr. Wells' \"A Modern Utopia\" and\r\nMr. Money's \"Riches and Poverty.\" The Basis of the Society was to be\r\nrewritten, its name changed to the British Socialist Party--a title\r\nsince adopted by the old Social Democratic Federation--the Executive\r\nCommittee was to be replaced by a Council of twenty-five, which was to\r\nappoint three Committees of three members each for Publishing, for\r\nPropaganda, and General Purposes respectively. The last, to be entitled\r\nthe Directing Committee, was to meet frequently and manage most of the\r\naffairs of the Society. Finally, \"in harmonious co-operation with other\r\nSocialist and Labour bodies,\" the Society was to run candidates for\r\nParliament and raise a fund for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that some of these proposals were merely speculative.\r\nGroups could be organised easily enough when the members in any district\r\nnumbered hundreds instead of units, or, at best, dozens. New tracts\r\ncould be published when they were written: a weekly review was possible\r\nif the capital was provided. The new Basis and the new name were matters\r\nof emphasis and taste rather than anything else. The new machinery of\r\ngovernment was in the main a question to be decided by experience. Mr.\r\nWells had none; it is said that he never sat on a Committee before that\r\nunder discussion, and certainly while he remained a Fabian he never\r\nacquired the Committee habit. On the principle underlying some of these\r\nproposals, viz. that the Society should cease to treat membership as a\r\nprivilege, and should aim at increasing its numbers, there was no\r\nserious controversy. The Executive Committee had already carried through\r\na suggestion made in the discussion on \"Faults of the Fabian\" for the\r\ncreation of a class of Associates, entitled to all privileges except\r\ncontrol over policy, with a view to provide a means of attracting new\r\nadherents. The one constructive proposal, direct collective\r\nparticipation in Parliamentary Elections, was quite alien to Mr. Wells'\r\noriginal ideas; it was forced on him, it is said, by other members of\r\nhis Committee and was described by himself later on as \"secondary and\r\nsubordinate.\"[35]\r\n\r\nThe Executive Committee transmitted the Special Committee's Report to\r\nthe members of the Society accompanied by a Report of their own, drafted\r\nby Bernard Shaw and incomparably superior to the other as a piece of\r\nliterature.[36]\r\n\r\nThe reply of the Executive Committee began by welcoming criticism from\r\nwithin the Society, of which they complained that in the past they had\r\nhad too little. An opposition, they said, was a requisite of good\r\ngovernment. They were prepared to welcome expansion, but they pointed\r\nout that the handsome offices proposed must be produced by the large\r\nincome and not the income by the handsome offices. A publishing business\r\non the scale suggested could not be undertaken by an unincorporated\r\nsociety; moreover, at present the Society had not sufficient income to\r\npay its officials at the market rate, or to keep out of debt to its\r\nprinter. They agreed that the Executive Committee should be enlarged,\r\nbut recommended twenty-one instead of twenty-five members; and that the\r\nthree proposed sub-committees be appointed, but of seven members each\r\ninstead of three. The project of triumvirates they could not endorse,\r\nboth for other reasons and because all the leading members of the\r\nSociety refused to serve on them, while the essence of the scheme was\r\nthat the triumvirs should be the most influential members of the\r\nSociety. The abolition of the old-fashioned restrictions on admission to\r\nmembership was approved, but not the proposal for a fixed subscription\r\npayable on an appointed date. The Executive Committee did not object to\r\nthe proposed new Basis as a whole (and in fact it is on record that its\r\nadoption by the Executive was only lost by 7 votes to 6); but considered\r\nthat passages were open to criticism and that the time and effort\r\nnecessary for carrying through any new Basis, so worded as to unite\r\npractically the whole Society, would be better spent in other ways. A\r\nSocialist weekly would be valuable, but it would not replace \"Fabian\r\nNews,\" which was required for the internal purposes of the Society, and\r\ncapable journalists like Mr. Wells himself preferred the publicity of\r\nthe \"Fortnightly Review\" and \"The Times,\" to the \"Clarion\" and the\r\n\"Labour Leader.\" The Reply goes at great length into the difficulty of\r\nforming a Socialist Party, and into the composition and policy of the\r\nLabour Party, all admirably argued, but just a little unreal; for\r\nBernard Shaw has never quite understood the Labour Party which he did so\r\nmuch to create, and at the same time he is thoroughly convinced that he\r\nsees it as it is, in the white light of his genius. Permeation is\r\ndescribed, explained, and defended--the Special Committee had suggested\r\nrather than proposed, in scarcely more than a sentence, that the policy\r\nbe abandoned--and it is announced that as long as the Executive was\r\nunchanged there would be no reversal of the political policy of the\r\nSociety. Finally the Reply asserts that the time had come to attempt the\r\nformation of a middle-class Socialist Party. At the end three\r\nresolutions were set out, which the Executive submitted to the Society\r\nfor discussion.\r\n\r\nHow much of personality, how little of principle there was in the great\r\ncontroversy is indicated by the fact that Mrs. Bernard Shaw signed the\r\nSpecial Committee Report, with the reservation that she also completely\r\nagreed with the Reply. Mr. Headlam also was a party to both documents:\r\nMr. G.R.S. Taylor, alone of the three Executive members of the Special\r\nCommittee, supported the Report and dissociated himself from the Reply.\r\nOf course the Executive Committee had to decide points in their Report\r\nby a majority. That majority, in the case of the proposed revision of\r\nthe Basis, was, as already mentioned, one vote only. I did not concur\r\nwith the view expressed about the Labour Party, a body scarcely less\r\neasy to be understood by an outsider than the Fabian Society itself: and\r\nat that time I was the only insider on the Fabian Executive.\r\n\r\nBut the real issue was a personal one. The Executive Committee at that\r\ntime consisted, in addition to the three just named, of Percy Alden\r\n(Liberal M.P. for Tottenham), Hubert Bland, Cecil E. Chesterton, Dr. F.\r\nLawson Dodd, F.W. Galton, S.G. Hobson, H.W. Macrosty, W. Stephen\r\nSanders, Bernard Shaw, George Standring, Sidney Webb and myself. Mr.\r\nAlden was too busy with his new parliamentary duties to take much part\r\nin the affair. All the rest, except of course Mr. Taylor, stood\r\ntogether on the real issue--Was the Society to be controlled by those\r\nwho had made it or was it to be handed over to Mr. Wells? We knew by\r\nthis time that he was a masterful person, very fond of his own way, very\r\nuncertain what that way was, and quite unaware whither it necessarily\r\nled. In any position except that of leader Mr. Wells was invaluable, as\r\nlong as he kept it! As leader we felt he would be impossible, and if he\r\nhad won the fight he would have justly claimed a mandate to manage the\r\nSociety on the lines he had laid down. As Bernard Shaw led for the\r\nExecutive, the controversy was really narrowed into Wells versus Shaw.\r\n\r\nThe Report was sent to the members with \"Fabian News\" for December,\r\n1906, and it was the occasion of much excitement. The Society had grown\r\nenormously during the year. The names of no less than ninety applicants\r\nfor membership are printed in that month's issue alone. In March, 1907,\r\nthe membership was 1267, an increase of nearly 500 in two years.\r\n\r\nThe discussion was carried on at a series of meetings held at Essex\r\nHall, Strand, under the chairmanship of Mr. H. Bond Holding, on December\r\n7th and 14th, 1906, and January 11th and 18th, February 1st and March\r\n8th, and also at the Annual Meeting for 1905-6, held on February 22nd,\r\n1907. The series was interrupted for the London County Council Election\r\non March 2nd, in which many of the members were concerned.\r\n\r\nWith a view to a \"Second Reading\" debate the executive Committee had put\r\ndown a general resolution that their report be received, but Mr. Wells\r\ndid not fall in with this plan, and the resolution on the motion of\r\nBernard Shaw was adopted without discussion. On the first clause of the\r\nnext resolution, instructing the Executive to submit amendments to the\r\nRules for increasing their number to twenty-five, Mr. Wells, acting for\r\nhimself, moved an amendment \"approving the spirit of the report of the\r\nCommittee of Enquiry, and desiring the outgoing Executive to make the\r\nearliest possible arrangements for the election of a new Executive to\r\ngive effect to that report.\" His speech, which occupied an hour and a\r\nquarter and covered the whole field, would have been great if Mr. Wells\r\nhad been a good speaker. Written out from notes, it was printed in full\r\nby himself for circulation amongst the members, and it is vigorous,\r\npicturesque entertaining, and imaginative, as his work always is. But it\r\ndelivered him into the hands of his more experienced opponents by\r\nvirtually challenging the society to discard them and enter on a\r\nregenerated career under his guidance. It was a heroic issue to force;\r\nand it was perhaps the real one; but it could have only one result. The\r\ndiscussion was adjourned to the 14th, and at 9 o'clock on that evening\r\nBernard Shaw replied on the whole debate. His main proposition was that,\r\nas the amendment had been converted by Mr. Wells' printed and circulated\r\nspeech into a motion of want of confidence, the leaders of the Society\r\nmust and would retire if it were adopted. They were willing to discuss\r\nevery point on its merits and to abide by the decision of the Society,\r\nbut they would not accept a general approval of the Committee's Report\r\nas against their own when it implied an accusation of misconduct. In the\r\ncourse of the speech Mr. Wells pledged himself not to retire from the\r\nSociety if he was defeated; and at the end of it he consented to\r\nwithdraw his amendment. Bernard Shaw's speech, probably the most\r\nimpressive he has ever made in the Society, was delivered to a large and\r\nkeenly appreciative audience in a state of extreme excitement. A long\r\nreport pacifically toned down by Shaw himself, appears in \"Fabian News\"\r\n(January, 1907). It succeeded in its object. The Executive Committee\r\nwelcomed the co-operation of Mr. Wells; the last thing they desired was\r\nto drive him out of the Society, and whilst they could not accept his\r\nreport as a whole, they were willing to adopt any particular item after\r\nfull discussion. There is no doubt that they would have won if the\r\namendment had gone to a division, but they were only too glad not to\r\ninflict a defeat on their opponents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next episode in the debate requires a few words of introduction. The\r\nSociety had always been in favour of votes for women. A proposition in\r\nthe Manifesto, Tract No. 2, published as early as 1884, states that \"men\r\nno longer need special political privileges to protect them against\r\nwomen,\" and in all our publications relating to the franchise or local\r\ngovernment the claims of women to equal citizenship were prominently put\r\nforward. But we had published no tract specially on the subject of the\r\nParliamentary Vote for Women. This was not mere neglect. In 1893 a\r\ncommittee was appointed \"to draw up a tract advocating the claims of\r\nwomen to all civil and political rights at present enjoyed by men,\" and\r\nin March, 1894, it reported that \"a tract had been prepared which the\r\nCommittee itself did not consider suitable for publication.\" Later the\r\nCommittee was discharged, and in face of this fiasco nothing further was\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nMr. Wells took a strong view on the importance of doing something in\r\nrelation to women and children, though exactly what he proposed was\r\nnever clear. He offered to the Society his little book on \"Socialism and\r\nthe Family,\" subsequently published by Mr. Fifield, but the Executive\r\nCommittee declined it precisely because of its vagueness: they were not\r\ndisposed to accept responsibility for criticisms on the existing\r\nsystem, unless some definite line of reform was proposed which they\r\ncould ask the Society to discuss and approve, or at any rate to issue as\r\na well-considered scheme suitable for presentation to the public.\r\n\r\nThe new Basis proposed by the Special Committee declared that the\r\nSociety sought to bring about \"a reconstruction of the social\r\norganisation\" by\r\n\r\n   _(a)_ promoting transfer of land and capital to the State,\r\n\r\n   _(b)_ \"enforcing equal citizenship of men and women,\r\n\r\n   _(c)_ \"substituting public for private authority in the education\r\n   and support of the young.\"\r\n\r\nPrecisely what the last clause meant has never been disclosed. Mr. Wells\r\nin his speech did nothing to elucidate it. Mr. Shaw in his reply\r\ncriticised its vagueness and protested against possible interpretations\r\nof it. Mr. Wells stated some time later that he had resigned from the\r\nSociety because we refused to adopt it. I do not think that any of his\r\ncolleagues attached much importance to it, and none of them has\r\nattempted to raise the issue since.[37]\r\n\r\nClause (b) was another matter. Nobody objected to the principle of\r\nthis, but many demurred to inserting it in the Basis. We regarded the\r\nBasis as a statement of the minimum of Socialism, without which no man\r\nhad the right to call himself a Socialist. But there are a few\r\nSocialists, such as Mr. Belfort Bax, who are opposed to women's\r\nsuffrage, and moreover, however important it be, some of us regard it as\r\na question of Democracy rather than Socialism. Certainly no one would\r\ncontend that approval of women's suffrage was acceptance of a part of\r\nthe creed of Socialism. It is a belief compatible with the most\r\nthoroughgoing individualism.\r\n\r\nBut many of the women members had made up their minds that this clause\r\nmust appear in the Basis, and under the leadership of Mrs. Pember\r\nReeves, they had indicated they would vote for the Special Committee\r\nReport unless they got their way. Those who, like myself, regarded this\r\namendment of the Basis as inexpedient, recognised also that the adoption\r\nof the Wells report was far more inexpedient, and the Executive\r\nconsequently decided to support a proposal that they be instructed to\r\nsubmit an addition to the Basis declaring for equal citizenship for men\r\nand women. On January 11th, 1907, Mrs. Pember Reeves obtained precedence\r\nfor a resolution to this effect, and she was seconded by Mrs. Sidney\r\nWebb, who, after fourteen years of membership, was now beginning to take\r\na part in the business of the Society. The opposition was led by Dr.\r\nMary O'Brien Harris, who objected not to the principle but to its\r\ninclusion in the Basis, but she was unsuccessful, and the instruction\r\nwas carried.\r\n\r\nOn January 18th the debate on the Executive resolutions was resumed, and\r\nit was resolved to increase the Executive Committee to twenty-one, to\r\nform three standing Sub-Committees, and to abolish the old restrictions\r\non membership. On February 1st the debate on Political Action began, and\r\nlargely turned on the question whether we should attempt to found a\r\nSocialist Party or should subordinate our political activity to the\r\nIndependent Labour Party. As the first step towards founding a\r\nmiddle-class Socialist Party was to be the establishment of Fabian\r\nSocieties throughout the country, those of us who like myself did not\r\nbelieve in the possibility of the proposed new party could none the less\r\nsupport the scheme. Co-operation with the Labour Party was not in\r\nquestion; nor was the continuance of our friendly relations with the\r\nI.L.P., but the proposal to subordinate our political activity to the\r\nlatter society met with but little support, and finally on March 2nd the\r\nExecutive resolution to appoint a Committee for the purpose of drawing\r\nup a political policy was adopted against a very small minority. Mr.\r\nWells took very little part in the proceedings after the Second Reading\r\ndebate, and only one speech of his is mentioned in the report.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the controversy was being fought out on another field. The\r\nJanuary meetings had settled the number of the new Executive and decided\r\nhow the Basis should be altered. The Executive therefore was now able to\r\nsummon the Annual Meeting in order to make the necessary amendments to\r\nthe Rules. This was held on February 22nd, when the resolutions were\r\nadopted without discussion. The meeting then took up some minor items in\r\nthe Report, and in particular certain other amendments to the Basis\r\nproposed by individual members. On these a resolution was carried that\r\nthe new Executive appoint a Committee to revise the Basis. The Committee\r\nwas in fact appointed, and consisted of Bernard Shaw, Sidney Webb, H.G.\r\nWells, and Sidney Ball of Oxford. Mr. Wells resigned from the Society\r\nbefore its labours were completed, and no report was ever presented.\r\n\r\nThe Annual Meeting over, the way was now clear for the election of the\r\nnew Executive. The ballot papers, sent out with the March \"News,\"\r\ncontained the names of 37 candidates, 13 out of the 15 of the retiring\r\nCommittee and 24 others. In normal years the practice of issuing\r\nelection addresses is strictly discouraged, because of the advantage\r\nthey give to those rich enough to afford the expense. Therefore the\r\nrecord of new candidates, severely concrete statements of past\r\nachievements, is published in \"Fabian News.\" On this occasion the usual\r\ndistinction between old and new candidates was not made, and the\r\nExecutive undertook to send out Election Addresses of candidates subject\r\nto necessary limits and on payment by the candidates of the cost of\r\nprinting. In addition numerous other addresses were posted to the\r\nelectors. The Old Gang made no attempt to monopolise the Executive by\r\nrunning a full ticket. The candidates in effect formed three groups, 15\r\nsupporters of the outgoing Executive, including 10 retiring members who\r\nissued a joint address; 13 candidates selected by a temporary Reform\r\nCommittee whose names were sent out by Mr. Wells and his chief\r\nadherents; 7 independents, some of them supporters of the Executive and\r\nthe others of the Reformers; and finally myself. As I was paid secretary\r\nand returning officer I did not formally associate myself with any\r\nparty, though my general sympathy with my old colleagues was well known.\r\nNine hundred and fifty-four members cast very nearly 17,000 votes.\r\nSidney Webb headed the poll with 819 votes; I followed with 809. Bernard\r\nShaw received 781, and Mr. Wells came fourth with 717. All the retiring\r\nmembers were re-elected except Cecil Chesterton, and including G.R.S.\r\nTaylor, who had vehemently opposed his colleagues. Eleven of the\r\nExecutive list, nine of the Reformers, and myself constituted the new\r\nCommittee. In fact it was an able and effective body. The Old Gang\r\nbrought in Mr. Granville Barker; the Reformers included Mr. Wells, Mrs.\r\nPember Reeves, Aylmer Maude, R.C.K. Ensor, Dr. Haden Guest, Sidney Ball,\r\nF.W. Pethick Lawrence, and Miss B.L. Hutchins--most, if not all, of whom\r\nreceived support from the friends of the Old Gang. Scarcely anything\r\nless like revolutionists can be imagined than this list. Mr. Pethick\r\nLawrence, it is true, has since then done some hard fighting in another\r\ncause, but he has always acted with seriousness and deliberation. Most\r\nof the others might as well have figured on one ticket as the other. The\r\nOld Gang including myself had 12 votes and all the experience, against 9\r\non the other side. But the two sides did not survive the first meeting\r\nof the new Committee. There was, as I have already said, no differences\r\nof principle between the two parties. The expansion of the parent\r\nSociety had come about, local Societies were growing up all over the\r\ncountry; Mr. Wells said no more about public authority over the\r\nyoung--indeed his election address made no reference to it--and Mr. Shaw\r\ndid nothing to establish his Middle-Class Socialist Party.\r\n\r\nThe new Committee quickly settled down to work, but Mr. Wells was\r\nalready wearying of his rôle as political organiser. He was appointed\r\nboth to the General Purposes and the Propaganda Sub-Committees, but\r\nafter attending two meetings of the former, and none of the latter, he\r\nresigned from both in October, and of the seventeen meetings of the\r\nExecutive Committee during its year of office he attended only seven.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1908, he was re-elected to the Executive, again fourth on the\r\npoll, and Mrs. Wells who had not been a candidate before was also\r\nsuccessful. But in the following September he resigned his membership of\r\nthe Society, assigning as reasons \"disagreement with the Basis which\r\nforms the Confession of Faith of the Society and discontent with the\r\ngeneral form of its activities,\" together with a desire \"to concentrate\r\non the writing of novels.\" He explained that \"a scheme which proposes to\r\nleave mother and child economically dependent on the father is not to me\r\nSocialism at all, but a miserable perversion of Socialism.\" The letter,\r\nprinted in \"Fabian News,\" goes on to refer to his objection to the \"no\r\ncompensation\" clause in the Basis (the real weakness of which is that it\r\nrefers hypothetically to a complete change of system and is never\r\napplied to any particular case[38]), and added that the opportunity for\r\na propaganda to the British middle classes was now over. Mrs. Wells\r\nretained her seat on the Executive Committee till March, 1910, and soon\r\nafter that date the connection of both of them with the Society\r\naltogether ceased.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have now traced the main stream of the subject of this chapter, though\r\na good deal remains to be said on other effects of the agitation. I\r\nhave indicated that the actual proposals made by the Special Committee\r\nunder the inspiration of Mr. Wells, in so far at any rate as they were\r\ncontroversial or controverted, were futile or impossible, and neither\r\nled, nor in my opinion could have led, to any benefit to the Society or\r\nto its objects. But it must not be inferred from this that the\r\nintervention of Mr. Wells, viewed as a whole, was of this character. He\r\nis a man of outstanding genius, and in so far as he used his powers\r\nappropriately, his work was of enormous value to Socialism; and his\r\nenergy and attractive personality added radiance to the Society only\r\nequalled in the early days when the seven Essayists were all in the\r\nfield and all fighting at their bravest. The new life in the Society\r\nduring those brilliant years was due to other factors as well as Mr.\r\nWells. Other Socialist Societies, in which he took no part, also\r\nincreased their numbers and launched out into fresh activities. But for\r\nus Mr. Wells was the spur which goaded us on, and though at the time we\r\nwere often forced to resent his want of tact, his difficult public\r\nmanners, and his constant shiftings of policy, we recognised then, and\r\nwe remember still, how much of permanent value he achieved.\r\n\r\nOf this the chiefest is his books, and as the Society as such had no\r\npart in them, anything more than a reference to them is outside the\r\nscope of this volume. But it must be said that his \"New Worlds for Old,\"\r\npublished in 1908, whilst he was a member of the Fabian Executive, is\r\nperhaps the best recent book on English Socialism.\r\n\r\nIn this connection Mr. Wells displayed unexpected modesty and at the\r\nsame time inexperience of the ways of the world. His first criticism of\r\nthe Society, his first project of reform, related to our tracts. To this\r\npoint he directed an unpublished preface to his paper \"This Misery of\r\nBoots,\" when he read it to the Society before the controversy had\r\nactually started. He justly observed that very few of our publications\r\nwere addressed to the unconverted, were emotional appeals to join our\r\nmovement, or effective explanations of our general principles. He said\r\nthat these ought to be written, and the odd thing is that he appeared to\r\nimagine that anybody, or at any rate a considerable number of people,\r\ncould just sit down and write them. He was aware that he could do it\r\nhimself, and he innocently imagined that plenty of other people could do\r\nit too. He blamed the Executive for failing to make use of the members\r\nin this respect, and persuaded them to invite any member to send in\r\nmanuscripts.\r\n\r\nIn fact of course something like genius, or, at any rate, very rare\r\nability, is required for this sort of work. Any competent writer can\r\ncollect the facts about Municipal Drink Trade, or Afforestation, or Poor\r\nLaw Reform: many can explain an Act of Parliament in simple language:\r\nbut only one here and there can write what others care to read on the\r\nprinciples of Socialism and the broad aspects of its propaganda. If our\r\nlist of tracts be examined it will be found that the great majority of\r\nthe \"general\" tracts have been written by Sidney Webb and Bernard Shaw.\r\nA few other writers have contributed general tracts from a special\r\nstandpoint, such as those on Christian Socialism. When we have mentioned\r\nreprinted papers by William Morris and Sir Oliver Lodge, and a tract by\r\nSidney Ball, the list is virtually complete. Mr. Wells himself only\r\ncontributed to us his paper \"This Misery of Boots,\" and his appeal to\r\nthe rank and file yielded nothing at all. Of course there are plenty of\r\npeople as innocent in this respect as Mr. Wells was at that period\r\nreferred to. Hardly a month has passed in the last twenty years without\r\nsomebody, usually from the remote provinces, sending up a paper on\r\nSocialism, which he is willing to allow the Society to publish on\r\nreasonable terms. But only once have we thus found an unknown author\r\nwhose work, on a special subject, we could publish, and he resigned a\r\nyear or two later because we were compelled to reject a second tract\r\nwhich he wrote for us.\r\n\r\nThe history of the intervention of Mr. Wells is now complete. Some\r\naccount of the expansion of the Society at this period will be given in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a drawing by Jessie Holliday_\r\n\r\nSIDNEY WEBB, IN 1909]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34] The \"Wells Report\" in October, 1906, recommended cordial\r\nco-operation with the Labour Party, including the running of candidates\r\nfor Parliament, and it \"warmly endorsed the conception of Socialists\r\nwhenever possible,... standing as Socialists in Municipal and\r\nParliamentary elections.\" In January, 1908, a scheme for effecting this\r\nwas adopted by the Society. In May, 1908, Mr. Wells, writing to \"Fabian\r\nNews,\" said he should resign if the Society rejected his view that \"the\r\nFabian Society is a Society for the study, development, and propaganda\r\nof the Socialist idea. It extends a friendly support to the Labour\r\nParty, but it is not a political society and membership involves no\r\nallegiance to any political party.\"\r\n\r\nThis was written in connection with his support of a Liberal against a\r\nSocialist Candidate at North-West Manchester.\r\n\r\n[35] In his election address referred to on p. 179.\r\n\r\n[36] Private.--Report of the special Committee appointed in February,\r\n1906, to consider measures for increasing the scope, influence, income,\r\nand activity of the Society, together with the Executive Committee's\r\nReport, and Resolutions thereon. To be submitted to the members at Essex\r\nHall on Fridays the 7th and 14th December, 1906, at 7.30 p.m. The Fabian\r\nSociety. November, 1906 (pp. 48).\r\n\r\n[37] See his \"New Worlds for Old,\" Chapter III, The First Main\r\nGeneralisation of Socialism, which according to Mr. Wells is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"The ideas of private individual rights of the parent and of his\r\nisolated responsibility for his children are harmfully exaggerated in\r\nthe contemporary world. We do not sufficiently protect children from\r\nnegligent, incompetent, selfish, or wicked parents.... The Socialist\r\nholds that the community should be responsible ... it is not simply the\r\nright but the duty of the State ... to intervene in any default for the\r\nchild's welfare. Parentage rightly undertaken is a service as well as a\r\nduty to the world ... in any completely civilised state it must be\r\nsustained, rewarded, and controlled....\"\r\n\r\nExcept for the last three words all this is neither new nor\r\ncontroversial amongst not merely Socialists but the mildest of social\r\nreformers, always excepting the Charity Organisation Society. The last\r\nword is not, I think, further explained.\r\n\r\n[38] A Tramway or a Gasworks consists of two things: the actual plant,\r\nand the nominal capital which represents its value. When the plant is\r\nmunicipalised, its control is vested in the community, and the\r\nshareholders are \"compensated\" with municipal securities or cash\r\nobtained by loans from other investors in these securities. The capital\r\nvalue of the tramway still virtually belongs to the private holders of\r\nthe municipal loan. But no second such step is possible. Holders of\r\nmunicipal stock cannot be \"compensated,\" if it is taken from them. They\r\ncan be paid off; or their property can be confiscated either by taxation\r\nor by repudiation of the debt: there is no middle course. The whole\r\nproblem therefore arises from confusion of thought.\r\n\r\nSee Fabian Tract 147 \"Capital and Compensation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\nThe Policy of Expansion: 1907-12\r\n\r\n   Statistics of growth--The psychology of the Recruit--Famous\r\n   Fabians--The Arts Group--The Nursery--The Women's Group--Provincial\r\n   Fabian Societies--University Fabian Societies--London Groups\r\n   revived--Annual Conferences--The Summer School--The story of\r\n   \"Socialist Unity\"--The Local Government Information Bureau--The Joint\r\n   Standing Committee--Intervention of the International Socialist\r\n   Bureau.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe episode described in the last chapter, which took place during the\r\nyears 1906 to 1908, was accompanied by many other developments in the\r\nactivities of the Society which must now be described. In the first\r\nplace the membership grew at an unprecedented rate. In the year ended\r\nMarch, 1905, 67 members were elected. Next year the number was 167, to\r\nMarch, 1907, it was 455, to March, 1908, 817, and to March, 1909, 665.\r\nThis was an enormous accession of new blood to a society which in 1904\r\nhad only 730 members in all. In 1909 the Society consisted of 1674 men\r\nand 788 women, a total of 2462; of these 1277 were ordinary members\r\nresiding in or near London, 343 scattered elsewhere in the United\r\nKingdom, 89 abroad; 414 were members of provincial Societies and 339 of\r\nUniversity Societies. There were in addition about 500 members of local\r\nFabian Societies who were not also members of the London Society, and\r\nthe Associates numbered 217. The income from subscriptions of all sorts\r\nwas £473 in 1904 and £1608 in 1908, the high-water mark in the history\r\nof the Society for contributions to the ordinary funds.\r\n\r\nOf course there is all the difference in the world between a new member\r\nand an old. The freshly elected candidate attends every meeting and\r\nreads every word of \"Fabian News.\" He begins, naturally, as a\r\nwhole-hearted admirer and is profoundly impressed with the brilliance of\r\nthe speakers, the efficiency of the organisation, the ability of the\r\ntracts. A year or two later, if he has any restlessness of intellect, he\r\nusually becomes a critic: he wants to know why there are not more\r\nbrightly written tracts, explanatory of Socialism and suitable for the\r\nunconverted: he complains that the lectures are far less interesting\r\nthan they used to be, that the debates are footling, the publications\r\nunattractive in appearance and too dull to read. A few years later he\r\neither settles down into a steady-going member, satisfied to do what\r\nlittle he can to improve this unsatisfactory world; or else, like Mr.\r\nWells, he announces that the Society is no longer any good: once (when\r\nhe joined) it was really important and effective: its methods _were_ all\r\nright: it _was_ proclaiming a fresh political gospel. But times have\r\nchanged, whilst the Society has only grown old: it has done its work,\r\nand missed its opportunity for more. It is no longer worthy of his\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 and 1908 the Society consisted largely of new members;\r\nconsequently the meetings were crowded and we were driven out from one\r\nhall after another. Moreover the propagandist enthusiasm of Mr. Wells\r\nand the glamour of his name helped to attract a large number of\r\ndistinguished persons into our ranks. Mr. Granville Barker was one of\r\nthe most active of these. He served on the Executive from 1907 to 1912\r\nand took a large share in the detailed work of the Committees, besides\r\ngiving many lectures and assisting in social functions. The Rev. R.J.\r\nCampbell, who addressed large meetings on several occasions, as also\r\nelected to the Executive for the year 1908-9, but did not attend a\r\nsingle meeting. Mr. Aylmer Maude joined the Executive in 1907, held\r\noffice to 1912, and is still a working member of the Society. Arnold\r\nBennett, Laurence Irving, Edgar Jepson, Reginald Bray, L.C.C. (member of\r\nthe Executive 1911-12), Sir Leo (then Mr.) Chiozza Money, M.P. (who sat\r\non the Executive from 1908 to 1911), Dr. Stanton Coit, H. Hamilton Fyfe,\r\nA.R. Orage, G.M. Trevelyan, Edward Garnett, Dr. G.B. Clark (for many\r\nyears M.P.), Miss Constance Smedley, Philip Snowden, M.P., Mrs. Snowden\r\n(Executive 1908-9), George Lansbury, Herbert Trench, Jerome K. Jerome,\r\nEdwin Pugh, Spencer Pryse, and A. Clutton Brock are amongst the people\r\nknown in politics, literature, or the arts who joined the Society about\r\nthis period.\r\n\r\nSome of these took little or no part in our proceedings, beyond paying\r\nthe necessary subscription, but others lectured or wrote for the Society\r\nor participated in discussions and social meetings. These were at this\r\ntime immensely successful. In the autumn of 1907, for example, Mrs.\r\nBernard Shaw arranged for the Society a series of crowded meetings of\r\nmembers and subscribers at Essex Hall on \"The Faith I Hold.\" Mrs. Sidney\r\nWebb led off and was followed by the Rev. R.J. Campbell, S.G. Hobson,\r\nDr. Stanton Coit, H.G. Wells, and Hubert Bland: with an additional\r\ndiscourse later in the spring by Sir Sydney Olivier. Mr. Wells' paper,\r\nwhich proved to be far too long for a lecture, was the first draft of\r\nhis book \"First and Last Things\"; but he had tired of the Society when\r\nit was published, and the preface conceals its origin in something of a\r\nmystery. Sir John Gorst, Mrs. Annie Besant, Dr. Südekum (German M.P.),\r\nSir John Cockburn, K.C.M.G., the Hon. W.P. Reeves, Raymond Unwin, and\r\nSir Leo Chiozza Money were amongst the other lecturers of that year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1906 and succeeding years a new form of organisation was established.\r\nMembers spontaneously associated themselves into groups, \"The Nursery\"\r\nfor the young, the Women's Group, the Arts Group, and Groups for\r\nEducation, Biology, and Local Government. The careers of these bodies\r\nwere various. The Arts Group included philosophy, and, to tell the\r\ntruth, almost excluded Socialism. But all of us in our youth are\r\nanxiously concerned about philosophy and art and many who are no longer\r\nyoung are in the same case. Moreover artists and philosophers are always\r\nattractive. Mr. Holbrook Jackson and Mr. A.R. Orage, at that time\r\nassociated in \"The New Age,\" founded the group early in 1907, and soon\r\nobtained lecturers as distinguished, and audiences scarcely less\r\nnumerous than the Society itself. But in eighteen months \"Art and\r\nPhilosophy in Relation to Socialism\" seems to have been exhausted, and\r\nafter the summer of 1908 the Group disappears from the calendar. Biology\r\nand Local Government had a somewhat longer but far less glorious career.\r\nThe meetings were small and more of the nature of classes. Education is\r\nthe life-work of a large class, which provides a sensible proportion of\r\nFabian membership, and teachers are always eager to discuss and explain\r\nthe difficult problems of their profession and the complex law which\r\nregulates it. The Education Group has led a diligent and useful life; it\r\nprepared a tract (No. 156), \"What an Education Committee can do\r\n(Elementary Schools),\" and besides its private meetings it arranges\r\noccasional lectures open to the public, which sometimes attract large\r\naudiences.\r\n\r\nThe Nursery belongs to another class. When a society, formed as many\r\nsocieties are, of quite young people, has existed over twenty years, the\r\nsecond generation begins to be adult, and wants to be quit of its\r\nparents. Moreover the young desire, naturally, to hear themselves talk,\r\nwhilst the others usually prefer the older and more famous personages.\r\nSo a number of younger members eagerly took up a plan which originated\r\nin the circle of the Bland family, for forming a group confined to the\r\nyoung in years or in membership in order to escape the overmastering\r\npresence of the elderly and experienced. Sometimes they invite a senior\r\nto talk to them and to be heckled at leisure. More often they provide\r\ntheir own fare from amongst themselves. Naturally the Nursery is not\r\nexclusively devoted to economics and politics: picnics and dances also\r\nhave their place. Some of the members eventually marry each other, and\r\nthere is no better security for prolonged happiness in marriage than\r\nsympathy in regard to the larger issues of life. The Nursery has\r\nproduced one tract, No. 132, \"A Guide to Books for Socialists,\"\r\ndescribed in the \"Wells Report\" as intended \"to supplement or even\r\nreplace that arid and indiscriminating catalogue, What to Read.\"\r\n\r\nLast in date, but by no means least in importance of the Groups of this\r\nperiod, was the Women's Group, founded by Mrs. C.M. Wilson, who after\r\nnearly twenty years of nominal membership had resumed her active\r\ninterest in the Society. The vigorous part taken by the women of the\r\nSociety under the leadership of Mrs. Reeves in obtaining the only\r\nalteration yet made in the Basis has been already described. The Group\r\nwas not formed till a year later, and at that time the Women's Suffrage\r\nmovement, and especially the party led by Mrs. Pankhurst, had attracted\r\nuniversal attention. The early Suffrage movement was mainly Socialist\r\nin origin: most of the first leaders of the Women's Social and Political\r\nUnion were or had been members either of the Fabian Society or of the\r\nI.L.P. and it may almost be said that all the women of the Society\r\njoined one or more of the Suffrage Societies which for the next seven\r\nyears played so large a part in national politics. But besides the\r\nquestion of the vote, which is not peculiar to Socialism, there is a\r\nvery large group of subjects of special interest to Socialist women,\r\neither practical problems of immediate politics relating to the wages\r\nand conditions of women's labour and the treatment of women by Education\r\nActs, National Insurance Acts, and Factory Acts; or remoter and more\r\ntheoretical problems, especially those connected with the question\r\nwhether the wife in the ideal state is to be an independent wage-earner\r\nor the mistress and manager of an isolated home, dependent on her\r\nhusband as breadwinner. Efficiently organised by Mrs. C.M. Wilson, until\r\nill-health required her resignation of the secretaryship in 1914; by\r\nMrs. Bernard Shaw, Mrs. Pember Reeves, Miss Murby, Miss Emma Brooke, and\r\nmany others, including in later years Dr. Letitia Fairfield, the Group\r\nhas had many of the characteristics of an independent society. It has\r\nits own office, latterly at 25 Tothill Street, rented from the parent\r\nSociety, with its own paid assistant secretary, and it has issued for\r\nprivate circulation its own publications. In 1913 it prepared a volume\r\nof essays on \"Women Workers in Seven Professions,\" which was edited by\r\nProfessor Edith Morley and published by George Routledge and Sons. It\r\nhas prepared five tracts for the Society, published in the general list,\r\nunder a sub-title, \"The Women's Group Series,\" and it has taken an\r\nactive part, both independently and in co-operation with other bodies,\r\nin the political movements specially affecting women, which have been\r\nso numerous in recent years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that the only direct result of the Special\r\nEnquiry Committee, apart from the changes made in the organisation of\r\nthe Society itself, was the decision to promote local Socialist\r\nSocieties of the Fabian type with a view to increasing Socialist\r\nrepresentation in Parliament. I have recounted in a previous chapter how\r\nthis scheme worked out in relation to the Labour Party and the running\r\nof candidates for Parliament. It remains to describe here its measure of\r\nsuccess in the formation of local societies.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1905 was about the low-water mark of provincial Fabianism.\r\nNine societies are named in the report, but four of these appeared to\r\nhave no more than a nominal existence. The Oxford University Society had\r\nbut 6 members; Glasgow had 30 in its University Society and 50 in its\r\ntown Society; Liverpool was reduced to 63, Leeds and County to 15, and\r\nthat was all. A year later the Cambridge University Society had been\r\nformed, Oxford had more than doubled its membership to 13, but only five\r\nother societies were in existence. By the following year a revival had\r\nset in. W. Stephen Sanders, at that time an Alderman of the London\r\nCounty Council, who had been a member of the Society since 1890 and of\r\nthe executive Committee since 1904, was appointed Organising Secretary\r\nwith the special object of building up the provincial organisation. By\r\n1910 there were forty-six local societies, and in 1912 the maximum of\r\nfifty was reached. Since then the number has declined. These societies\r\nwere scattered over the country, some of them in the great cities,\r\nManchester, Newcastle, Sheffield, and so on: others within hail of\r\nLondon, at Croydon, Letchworth, Ilford: others again in small towns,\r\nCanterbury, Chelmsford, Carnarvon: another was at Bedales School,\r\nPetersfield, run by my son and his schoolfellows. The local societies\r\nformed at this period, apart from the University Societies, were in the\r\nmain pallid reflections of the parent Society in its earlier days; none\r\nof them had the good fortune to find a member, so far as we yet know, of\r\neven second-class rank as a thinker or speaker. One or two produced\r\npraiseworthy local tracts on housing conditions and similar subjects.\r\nThey usually displayed less tolerance than the London Society, a greater\r\ninclination to insist that there was but one way of political salvation,\r\nusually the Labour Party way, and that all who would not walk in it\r\nshould be treated as alien enemies. If Socialism is only to be achieved\r\nby the making of Socialists, as Mr. Wells announced with all the\r\nemphasis of a rediscovery, no doubt the local societies achieved some\r\nSocialism, since they made some members. If Socialism is to be attained\r\nby the making of Socialist measures, doubtless they accomplished a\r\nlittle by their influence on local administration. Organisation for\r\npolitical work is always educative to those who take part in it, and it\r\nhas some effect on the infinitely complex parallelogram of forces which\r\ndetermines the direction of progress. Possibly I underestimate the\r\nimportance of local Fabian Societies; there is a school of thought,\r\noften represented in the Society, which regards the provinces with\r\nreverent awe--omne ignotum pro magnifico--as the true source of\r\npolitical wisdom, which Londoners should endeavour to discover and obey.\r\nLondoners no doubt see little of organised labour, and even less of\r\nindustrial co-operation: the agricultural labourer is to them almost a\r\nforeigner: the Welsh miner belongs to another race. But the business\r\nmen, the professional class, and the political organisers of Manchester\r\nand Glasgow have, in my opinion, no better intuitions, and usually less\r\nknowledge than their equivalents in London, and they have the\r\ndisadvantage of comparative isolation. London, the brain of the Empire,\r\nwhere reside the leaders in politics and in commerce, in literature, in\r\njournalism and in art, and which consequently attracts the young men who\r\naspire to be the next generation of leaders, where too are stationed all\r\nthe higher ranks of Civil Service, is different in kind, as well as in\r\nsize, from other cities. New thought on social subjects is almost always\r\nthe product of association. Only those who live in a crowd of other\r\nthinkers know where there is room for new ideas; for it takes years for\r\nthe top layer of political thought to find expression in books.\r\nTherefore the provincial thinker on social problems is always a little\r\nout of date. Except for one or two University men (e.g. Sidney Ball and\r\nSir Oliver Lodge) practically all Fabian tract-writers have been\r\nLondoners. The local Fabian Societies have so far achieved nothing\r\ntowards the making of a middle-class Socialist party, and they have\r\nachieved but little else. They have been fully justified because every\r\nassociation for mutual instruction adds something to the mass of\r\npolitical intelligence, does something to disseminate ideas, but that is\r\nall that can be said for them.\r\n\r\nThe University Societies belong to a different type. Nothing is more\r\nimportant than the education of young men and women in politics, and the\r\nolder Universities have always recognised this. Socialist Societies\r\naccordingly grew up naturally alongside Liberal and Tory Clubs, and\r\nunder the shadow of the \"Unions.\" Oxford, as we have seen, had a\r\nUniversity Fabian Society from early days. Cambridge followed at a much\r\nlater date. For years Glasgow University and University College,\r\nAberystwyth, maintained flourishing societies. The newer Universities,\r\ndependent largely on the bounty of wealthy capitalist founders and\r\nsupporters, and assisted by, or in close touch with, town councils and\r\nlocal industries, have been much less willing to sanction political\r\nfree-thought amongst their undergraduates, and the pernicious influence\r\nof wealth, or rather the fear of alarming the wealthy, has at times\r\ninduced the authorities to interfere with the freedom of the\r\nundergraduates to combine for the study and propaganda of Socialism.\r\n\r\nUndergraduate societies are composed of a constantly shifting\r\npopulation, and we arranged from the first that all their members should\r\nalso be elected direct to the parent Society in order that they might\r\nremain automatically in membership when they \"go down.\" In fact of\r\ncourse the percentage which retains its membership is very small. \"Men\"\r\nand women at Universities join any organisation whose leaders at the\r\nmoment are influential and popular. They are sampling life to discover\r\nwhat suits them, and a few years later some of them are scattered over\r\nthe globe, others immersed in science or art, or wholly occupied in law\r\nand medicine, in the church and the army, in the civil service and in\r\njournalism. Most of them no doubt have ceased to pretend to take\r\ninterest in social and political reform. A few remain, and these are\r\namongst the most valuable of our members. At times, when an\r\nundergraduate of force of character and high social position, the heir\r\nto a peerage for example, is for the moment an ardent Socialist, the\r\nFabian Society becomes, in a certain set or college, the fashionable\r\norganisation. On the whole it is true that Socialists are born and not\r\nmade, and very few of the hundreds who join at such periods stay for\r\nmore than a couple of years. The maximum University membership--on\r\npaper--was in 1914, when it reached 541 members, of whom 101 were at\r\nOxford and 70 at Cambridge. But the weakness of undergraduate Socialism\r\nis indicated by the extraordinary difficulty found in paying to the\r\nparent Society the very moderate fee of a shilling a head per annum, and\r\nthe effect of attempting to enforce this in 1915, combined with the\r\npropaganda of Guild Socialism, especially at Oxford, was for the moment\r\nto break up the apparently imposing array of University Fabianism.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 Clifford Allen of Cambridge formed the University Socialist\r\nFederation, which was in fact a Federation of Fabian Societies though\r\nnot nominally confined to them. Mr. Allen, an eloquent speaker and\r\nadmirable organiser, with most of the virtues and some of the defects of\r\nthe successful propagandist, planned the foundations of the Federation\r\non broad lines. It started a sumptuous quarterly, \"The University\r\nSocialist,\" the contents of which by no means equalled the excellence of\r\nthe print and paper. It did not survive the second number. The\r\nFederation has held several conferences, mostly at Barrow House--of\r\nwhich later--and issued various documents. Its object is to encourage\r\nUniversity Socialism and to found organisations in every University. It\r\nstill exists, but whether it will survive the period of depression which\r\nhas coincided with the war remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nLastly, amongst the organs of Fabian activity come the London Groups. In\r\nthe years of rapid growth that followed the publication of \"Fabian\r\nEssays\" the London Groups maintained a fairly genuine existence. London\r\nwas teeming with political lectures, and in the decade 1889-1899 its\r\nGovernment was revolutionised by the County Councils Act of 1888, the\r\nLocal Government Act of 1894, and the London Government Act of 1899\r\nwhich established the Metropolitan Boroughs. Socialism, too, was a\r\nnovelty, and the few who knew about it were in request.\r\n\r\nAnyway even with the small membership of those days, the London Groups\r\nmanaged to persist, and \"Fabian News\" is full of reports of conferences\r\nof Group Secretaries and accounts of Group activities. In the trough of\r\ndepression between the South African War and the Liberal victory of 1906\r\nall this disappeared and the Group system scarcely existed even on\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nWith the expansion which began in 1906 the Groups revived. New members\r\nwere hungry for lectures: many of them desired more opportunities to\r\ntalk than the Society meetings afforded. All believed in or hoped for\r\nMr. Wells' myriad membership. He himself was glad to address\r\ndrawing-room meetings, and the other leaders did the same. Moreover the\r\nSociety was conducting a series of \"Suburban Lectures\" by paid\r\nlecturers, in more or less middle-class residential areas of the Home\r\nCounties. Lectures to the Leisured Classes, a polite term for the idle\r\nrich, were arranged with considerable success in the West End, and other\r\nlectures, meetings, and social gatherings were incessant.\r\n\r\nFor co-ordinating these various bodies the Fabian Society has created\r\nits own form of organisation fitted to its peculiar circumstances, and\r\nmore like that of the British Empire than anything else known to me. As\r\nis the United Kingdom in the British Empire, so in the Fabian movement\r\nthe parent Society is larger, richer, and more powerful, and in all\r\nrespects more important than all the others put together. Any form of\r\nfederal organisation is impossible, because federation assumes some\r\napproach to equality amongst constituents. Our local societies, like the\r\nBritish self-governing Dominions, are practically independent,\r\nespecially in the very important department of finance. The Groups, on\r\nthe other hand, are like County Councils, local organisations within\r\nspecial areas for particular purposes, with their own finances for those\r\npurposes only. But the parent Society is not made up of Groups, any more\r\nthan the British Government is composed of County Councils. The local\r\nGroups consist of members of the Society qualified for the group by\r\nresidence in the group area; the \"Subject Groups\" of those associated\r\nfor some particular purpose.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the Society (as it is of the Empire) was to give the\r\nlocal societies and the groups some real function which should emphasise\r\nand sustain the solidarity of the whole; and at the same time leave\r\nunimpaired the control of the parent Society over its own affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Second Annual Conference of Fabian Societies and Groups was held on\r\nJuly 6th, 1907, under the chairmanship of Hubert Bland, who opened the\r\nproceedings with an account of the first Conference held in 1892 and\r\ndescribed in an earlier chapter. Fifteen delegates from 9 local and\r\nUniversity Societies, 16 from 8 London Groups, 8 from Subject Groups,\r\nand 9 members of the Executive Committee were present. The business\r\nconsisted of the sanction of rules for the Pan-Fabian Organisation.\r\n\r\nThe Conference of 1908 was a much bigger affair. A dozen members of the\r\nExecutive, including Mr. H.G. Wells and (as he then was) Mr. L.G.\r\nChiozza Money. M.P., and 61 delegates representing 36 Groups and\r\nSocieties met for a whole-day conference at University Hall, Gordon\r\nSquare. Miss Murby was chairman, and addressed the delegates on the\r\nimportance of tolerance, an apposite subject in view of the discussion\r\nto follow on the proposed parliamentary action, especially the delicate\r\nissue between co-operation with the Labour Party and the promotion of a\r\npurely Socialist party. A resolution favouring exclusive support of\r\nindependent Socialist candidatures moved by Mr. J.A. Allan of Glasgow\r\nreceived only 10 votes, but another advocating preference for such\r\ncandidates was only defeated by 26 to 21. The resolution adopted left\r\nthe question to be settled in each case by the constituency concerned.\r\nAnother resolution directed towards condemnation of members who worked\r\nwith the Liberal or Tory Party failed by 3 votes only, 17 to 20. In the\r\nafternoon Mr. Money gave an address on the Sources of Socialist Revenue,\r\nand a number of administrative matters were discussed.\r\n\r\nThe 1909 Conference was attended by 29 delegates of local and University\r\nSocieties, and by 46 delegates from London Groups and from the parent\r\nSociety. On this occasion a Constitution was adopted giving the\r\nConference a regular status, the chief provisions of which required the\r\nsubmission to the Conference of any alteration of the Basis, and \"any\r\nunion affiliation or formal alliance with any other society or with any\r\npolitical party whereby the freedom of action of any society ... is in\r\nany way limited ... \"; and of any change in the constitution itself.\r\nThese are all matters which concern the local organisations, as they are\r\nrequired to adopt the Basis, or some approved equivalent, and are\r\naffiliated to the Labour Party through the parent Society. No\r\ncontentious topic was on this occasion seriously discussed.\r\n\r\nThe Conference of 1910 was smaller, sixty-one delegates in all.\r\nResolutions against promoting parliamentary candidatures and favouring\r\nthe by this time vanishing project for an independent Socialist party\r\nobtained but little support, and the chief controversy was over an\r\nabstract resolution on the \"economic independence of women,\" which was\r\nin the end settled by a compromise drafted by Sidney Webb.\r\n\r\nSixty delegates were present at the 1911 Conference, held at Clifford's\r\nInn, who, after rejecting by a seven to one majority a resolution to\r\nconfine Fabian membership to Labour Party adherents, devoted themselves\r\nmainly to opposition to the National Insurance Bill then before\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 the Conference was still large and still concerned in the\r\nposition of the Society in relation to Labour and Liberalism.\r\n\r\nBoth in 1913 and in 1914 the Conference was well attended and prolonged,\r\nbut in 1915, partly on account of the war and partly because of the\r\ndefection of several University Societies, few were present, and the\r\nbusiness done was inconsiderable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Summer School was another enterprise started at the period. It was\r\nbegun independently of the Society in this sense, that half a dozen\r\nmembers agreed to put up the necessary capital and to accept the\r\nfinancial responsibility, leaving to the Society the arrangement of\r\nlectures and the management of business.\r\n\r\nIt was opened at the end of July, 1907, at Pen-yr-allt, a large house,\r\npreviously used as a school, looking out over the sea, near Llanbedr, a\r\nlittle village on the Welsh coast between Barmouth and Harlech. The\r\nhouse was taken for three years partly furnished, and the committee\r\nprovided the beds, cutlery, etc., needed. One or two other houses near\r\nby were usually rented for the summer months.\r\n\r\nThe value of the plan for a propagandist society is largely this, that\r\nexperience shows that people can only work together efficiently when\r\nthey know each other. Therefore in practice political and many other\r\norganisations find it necessary to arrange garden parties, fêtes,\r\npicnics, teas, and functions of all sorts in order to bring together\r\ntheir numbers under such conditions as enable them to become personally\r\nacquainted with each other. In times of expansion the Fabian Society\r\nhas held dinners and soirées in London, many of which have been\r\nsuccessful and even brilliant occasions, because the new members come in\r\ncrowds and the old attend as a duty. When new members are few these\r\nentertainments cease, for nothing is so dreary as a social function that\r\nis half failure, and a hint of it brings the series to an end. But a\r\nSummer School where members pass weeks together is far more valuable in\r\nenabling the leaders and officials to find out who there is who is good\r\nas a speaker or thinker, or who is a specialist on some subject of value\r\nto the movement. Moreover, gatherings of this class attract those on the\r\nfringe of the movement, and many of our members have come to us through\r\nattendance at the school. Apart from the direct interests of the\r\nSociety, a School of this character is valued by many solitary people,\r\nsolitary both socially, such as teachers and civil servants, who are\r\noften lonely in the world, and solitary intellectually because they live\r\nin remote places where people of their way of thinking are scarce.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to describe the arrangements of the School, for\r\nthese institutions have in the last few years become familiar to\r\neverybody. We do not, however, as a rule make quite such a business of\r\nthe schooling as is usual where the term is short, and study is the sole\r\nobject. One regular lecture a day for four days a week is the rule, but\r\nimpromptu lectures or debates in the evenings, got up amongst the\r\nguests, are customary. Moreover, frequent conferences on special\r\nsubjects are held, either by allied bodies, such as the Committee for\r\nthe Prevention of Destitution, or by a Group, such as the Education\r\nGroup or the Research Department. On these occasions the proportion of\r\nwork to play is higher. The School-house belongs to the Society for the\r\nwhole year, and parties are arranged for Christmas, Easter, and\r\nWhitsuntide whenever possible.\r\n\r\nAfter four years at Llanbedr the lease was terminated and the original\r\nCommittee wound up. The capital borrowed had all been repaid, and there\r\nremained, after a sale by auction, a lot of property and nearly £100 in\r\ncash. This the Committee transferred to the Society, and thereupon the\r\nquasi-independence of the Summer School came to an end. In 1911 a new\r\nexperiment was tried. A small hotel at Saas Grund, off the Rhone Valley,\r\nwas secured, and during six weeks three large parties of Fabians\r\noccupied it for periods of a fortnight each. The summer was one of the\r\nfinest of recent years, and the high mountains were exceptionally\r\nattractive. On account of the remoteness of the place, and the desire to\r\nmake the most of a short time, lectures were as a rule confined to the\r\nevening, and distinguished visitors were few, but an address by Dr.\r\nHertz of Paris, one of the few French Fabians, may be mentioned, partly\r\nbecause in the summer of 1915 his promising career was cut short in the\r\ntrenches which protected his country from the German invaders.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 Barrow House, Derwentwater, was taken for three years, a\r\nbeautiful place with the Barrow Falls in the garden on one side, and\r\ngrounds sloping down to the lake on the other, with its own boating pier\r\nand bathing-place. A camp of tents for men was set up, and as many as\r\nfifty or sixty guests could be accommodated at a time. Much of the\r\nsuccess of the School has throughout been due to Miss Mary Hankinson,\r\nwho from nearly the beginning has been a most popular and efficient\r\nmanager. A director is selected by the Committee to act as nominal head,\r\nand holds office usually for a week or a fortnight; but the chief of\r\nstaff is a permanent institution, and is not only business manager, but\r\nalso organiser and leader of excursions and a principal figure in all\r\nsocial undertakings. A great part in arranging for the School from the\r\nfirst has been taken by Dr. Lawson Dodd, to whose experience and energy\r\nmuch of its success has been due.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe year 1911 saw the formation of the Joint Standing Committee with the\r\nI.L.P., and this is a convenient place to describe the series of\r\nattempts at Socialist Unity which began a long way back in the history\r\nof the Society. For the first eight years or so of the Socialist\r\nmovement the problem of unity did not arise. Until the publication of\r\n\"Fabian Essays\" the Fabian Society was small, and the S.D.F., firm in\r\nits Marxian faith, and confident that the only way of salvation was its\r\nparticular way, had no more idea of uniting with the other societies\r\nthan the Roman Catholic Church has of union with Lutherans or\r\nMethodists. The Socialist League was the outcome of an internal dispute,\r\nand, if my memory is correct, the S.D.F. expected, not without reason,\r\nthat the seceders would ultimately return to the fold. The League ceased\r\nto count when at the end of 1890 William Morris left it and\r\nreconstituted as the Hammersmith Socialist Society the branch which met\r\nin the little hall constructed out of the stable attached to Kelmscott\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1893, seven delegates from this Society held a conference\r\nwith Fabian delegates, and at a second meeting at which S.D.F. delegates\r\nwere present a scheme for promoting unity was approved. A Joint\r\nCommittee of five from each body assembled on February 23rd, when\r\nWilliam Morris was appointed Chairman, with Sydney Olivier as Treasurer,\r\nand it was decided that the Chairman with H.M. Hyndman and Bernard Shaw\r\nshould draft a Joint Manifesto. The \"Manifesto of English Socialists,\"\r\npublished on May 1st, 1893, as a penny pamphlet with the customary red\r\ncover, was signed by the three Secretaries, H.W. Lee of the S.D.F.,\r\nEmery Walker of the H.S.S., and myself, and by fifteen delegates,\r\nincluding Sydney Olivier and Sidney Webb of the F.S., Harry Quelch of\r\nthe S.D.F., and the three authors.\r\n\r\nLike most joint productions of clever men, it is by no means an\r\ninspiring document. The less said, the less to dispute about, and so it\r\nonly runs to eight pages of large print, four devoted to the evils of\r\ncapitalism, unemployment, the decline of agriculture, and the\r\nill-nurture of children, and the rest to remedies, a queer list,\r\nconsisting of:--\r\n\r\n   An eight hours law.\r\n\r\n   Prohibition of child labour for wages.\r\n\r\n   Free Maintenance for all necessitous children (a compromise in which\r\n   Fabian influence may be traced by the insertion of the word\r\n   \"necessitous\").\r\n\r\n   Equal payment of men and women for equal work.\r\n\r\n(A principle which, whether good or bad, belongs rather to individualism\r\nthan to Socialism: Socialism according to Bernard Shaw--and most of us\r\nagree with him--demands as an ideal equal maintenance irrespective of\r\nwork; and in the meantime payment according to need, each to receive\r\nthat share of the national product which he requires in order to do his\r\nwork and maintain his dependents, if any, appropriately.)\r\n\r\nTo resume the programme:--\r\n\r\n   An adequate minimum wage for all adults employed in Government and\r\n   Municipal services or in any monopolies such as railways enjoying\r\n   State privileges.\r\n\r\n   Suppression of all sub-contracting and sweating (an ignorant\r\n   confusion between a harmless industrial method and its occasional\r\n   abuse).\r\n\r\n   Universal suffrage for all adults, men and women alike.\r\n\r\n   Public payment for all public service.\r\n\r\nThese of course were only means tending towards the ideal, \"to wit, the\r\nsupplanting of the present state by a society of equality of condition,\"\r\nand then follows a sentence paraphrased from the Fabian Basis embodying\r\na last trace of that Utopian idealism which imagines that society can be\r\nconstituted so as to enable men to live in freedom without eternal\r\nvigilance, namely, \"When this great change is completely carried out,\r\nthe genuine liberty of all will be secured by the free play of social\r\nforces with much less coercive interference than the present system\r\nentails.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these extracts it will be seen that the Manifesto, drafted by\r\nWilliam Morris, but mutilated and patched up by the other two, bears the\r\nimprint neither of his style, nor that of Shaw, but reminds one rather\r\nof mid-Victorian dining-room furniture, solid, respectable, heavily\r\nornate, and quite uninteresting. Happily there is not much of it!\r\n\r\nUnity was attained by the total avoidance of the contentious question of\r\npolitical policy. But fifteen active Socialists sitting together at a\r\nperiod when parties were so evenly divided that a General Election was\r\nalways imminent could not refrain from immediate politics, and the\r\nS.D.F., like many other bodies, always cherished the illusion that the\r\ndefeat of a minority at a joint conference on a question of principle\r\nwould put that minority out of action.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, as soon as the Manifesto had been published resolutions\r\nwere tabled pledging the constituent societies to concentrate their\r\nefforts on Socialist candidates accepted as suitable by the Joint\r\nCommittee. On this point the Fabian Society was in a hopeless minority,\r\nand an endless vista of futile and acrimonious discussions was opened\r\nout which would lead to unrest in our own society--for there has always\r\nbeen a minority opposed to its dominant policy--and a waste of time and\r\ntemper to the delegates from our Executive. It was therefore resolved at\r\nthe end of July that our delegates be withdrawn, and that put an end to\r\nthe Joint Committee.\r\n\r\nThe decision was challenged at a members' meeting by E.E. Williams, one\r\nof the signatories of the Joint Manifesto, subsequently well known as\r\nthe author of \"Made in Germany,\" and in some sense the real founder of\r\nthe Tariff Reform movement; but the members by a decisive vote upheld\r\nthe action of their Executive.\r\n\r\nFour years later, early in 1897, another effort after Unity was made. By\r\nthis time Morris, whose outstanding personality had given him a\r\ncommanding and in some respects a moderating influence in the movement,\r\nwas dead; and the Hammersmith Socialist Society had disappeared. Instead\r\nthere was the new and vigorous Independent Labour Party, already the\r\npremier Socialist body in point of public influence. This body took the\r\nfirst step, and a meeting was held in April at the Fabian office,\r\nattended by Hubert Bland, Bernard Shaw, and myself as delegates from our\r\nSociety. The proposal before the Conference was \"the formation of a\r\ncourt of appeal to adjudicate between rival Socialist candidates\r\nstanding for the same seat at any contested election,\" an occurrence\r\nwhich has in fact been rare in local and virtually unknown in\r\nParliamentary elections.\r\n\r\nAs the Fabian Society did not at that time officially run candidates,\r\nand has always allowed to its members liberty of action in party\r\npolitics, it was impossible for us to undertake that our members would\r\nobey any such tribunal. The difficulty was however solved by the S.D.F.,\r\nwhose delegates to the second meeting, held in July, announced that they\r\nwere instructed to withdraw from the Committee if the Fabian delegates\r\nremained. The I.L.P. naturally preferred the S.D.F. to ourselves,\r\nbecause their actual rivalry was always with that body, and we were only\r\ntoo glad to accept from others the dismissal which we desired. So our\r\ndelegates walked out, leaving the other two parties in temporary\r\npossession of our office, and Socialist Unity so far as we were\r\nconcerned again vanished. I do not think that the court of appeal was\r\never constituted, and certainly the relations between the other two\r\nSocieties continued to be difficult.\r\n\r\nThe next move was one of a practical character. The Fabian Society had\r\nalways taken special interest in Local Government, as a method of\r\nobtaining piecemeal Socialism, and had long acted as an informal\r\nInformation Bureau on the law and practice of local government\r\nadministration. The success of the I.L.P. in getting its members elected\r\nto local authorities suggested a conference of such persons, which was\r\nheld at Easter, 1899, on the days preceding the I.L.P. Annual Conference\r\nat Leeds. Sidney Webb was invited to be President, and gave an address\r\non \"The Sphere of Municipal Statesmanship\"; Will Crooks was Chairman of\r\nthe Poor Law Section. At this Conference it was resolved to form a Local\r\nGovernment Information Bureau, to be jointly managed by the I.L.P. and\r\nthe Fabian Society; it was intended for Labour members of local\r\nauthorities, but anybody could join on payment of the annual\r\nsubscription of 2s. 6d. For this sum the subscriber obtained the right\r\nto have questions answered free of charge, and to receive both \"Fabian\r\nNews\" and the official publications of the I.L.P., other than their\r\nweekly newspaper. The Bureau also published annual Reports, at first on\r\nBills before Parliament, and latterly abstracts of such Acts passed by\r\nParliament as were of interest to its members. It pursued an uneventful\r\nbut useful career, managed virtually by the secretaries of the two\r\nsocieties, which divided the funds annually in proportion to the\r\nliterature supplied. Several Easter Conferences of Elected Persons were\r\nheld with varying success. Later on the nominal control was handed over\r\nto the Joint Committee, next to be described.\r\n\r\nThe problem of Socialist Unity seemed to be approaching a settlement\r\nwhen the three organisations, in 1900, joined hands with the Trade\r\nUnions in the formation of the Labour Representation Committee, later\r\nrenamed the Labour Party. But in 1901, eighteen months after the\r\nCommittee was constituted, the S.D.F. withdrew, and thereafter unity\r\nbecame more difficult than ever, since two societies were united for\r\ncollective political action with the numerically and financially\r\npowerful trade unions, whilst the third took up the position of hostile\r\nisolation. But between the Fabian Society and the I.L.P. friendly\r\nrelations became closer than ever. The divergent political policies of\r\nthe two, the only matter over which they had differed, had been largely\r\nsettled by change of circumstances. The Fabian Society had rightly held\r\nthat the plan of building up an effective political party out of\r\nindividual adherents to any one society was impracticable, and the\r\nI.L.P. had in fact adopted another method, the permeation of existing\r\norganisations, the Trade Unions. On the other hand the Fabian Society,\r\nwhich at first confined its permeation almost entirely to the Liberal\r\nParty, because this was the only existing organisation accessible--we\r\ncould not work through the Trade Unions, because we were not eligible to\r\njoin them--was perfectly willing to place its views before the Labour\r\nParty, from which it was assured of sympathetic attention. Neither the\r\nFabian Society nor the I.L.P. desired to lose its identity, or to\r\nabandon its special methods. But half or two-thirds of the Fabians\r\nbelonged also to the I.L.P., and nearly all the I.L.P. leaders were or\r\nhad been members of the Fabian Society.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was made in March, 1911, by Henry H. Slesser, then one of\r\nthe younger members of the Executive, that the friendly relations of the\r\ntwo bodies should be further cemented by the formation of a Joint\r\nStanding Committee. Four members of each Executive together with the\r\nsecretaries were appointed, and W.C. Anderson, later M.P. for the\r\nAttercliffe Division of Sheffield, and at that time Chairman of the\r\nI.L.P., was elected Chairman, a post which he has ever since retained.\r\nThe Joint Committee has wisely confined its activities to matters about\r\nwhich there was no disagreement, and its proceedings have always been\r\nharmonious to the verge of dullness. The Committee began by arranging a\r\nshort series of lectures, replacing for the time the ordinary Fabian\r\nmeetings, and it proposed to the Labour Party a demonstration in favour\r\nof Adult Suffrage, which was successfully held at the Royal Albert Hall.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1912-13 the Joint Committee co-operated with the\r\nNational Committee for the Prevention of Destitution (of which later) in\r\na big War against Poverty Campaign, to demand a minimum standard of\r\ncivilised life for all. A demonstration at the Albert Hall, a Conference\r\nat the Memorial Hall, twenty-nine other Conferences throughout Great\r\nBritain, all attended by numerous delegates from Trade Unions and other\r\norganisations, and innumerable separate meetings were among the\r\nactivities of the Committee. In 1913 a large number of educational\r\nclasses were arranged. In the winter of 1913-14 the I.L.P. desired to\r\nconcentrate its attention on its own \"Coming of Age Campaign,\" an\r\ninternal affair, in which co-operation with another body was\r\ninappropriate. A few months later the War began and, for reasons\r\nexplained later, joint action remains for the time in abeyance.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to complete the history of the movements for\r\nSocialist Unity, though it extends beyond the period assigned to this\r\nchapter, and we must now turn back to the beginning of another line of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe International Socialist and Trade Union Congresses held at intervals\r\nof three or four years since 1889 were at first no more than isolated\r\nCongresses, arranged by local organisations constituted for the purpose\r\nin the preceding year. Each nation voted as one, or at most, as two\r\nunits, and therefore no limit was placed on the number of its delegates:\r\nthe one delegate from Argentina or Japan consequently held equal voting\r\npower to the scores or even hundreds from France or Germany. But\r\ngradually the organisation was tightened up, and in 1907 a scheme was\r\nadopted which gave twenty votes each to the leading nations, and\r\nproportionately fewer to the others. Moreover a permanent Bureau was\r\nestablished at Brussels, with Emile Vandervelde, the distinguished\r\nleader of the Belgian Socialists, later well known in England as the\r\nMinisterial representative of the Belgian Government during the war, as\r\nChairman. In England, where the Socialist and Trade Union forces were\r\ndivided, it was necessary to constitute a special joint committee in\r\norder to raise the British quota of the cost of the Bureau, and to\r\nelect and instruct the British delegates. It was decided by the Brussels\r\nBureau that the 20 British votes should be allotted, 10 to the Labour\r\nParty, 4 to the I.L.P., 4 to the British Socialist Party (into which the\r\nold S.D.F. had merged), and 2 to the Fabian Society, and the British\r\nSection of the International Socialist Bureau was, and still remains,\r\nconstituted financially and electorally on that basis.\r\n\r\nIn France and in several other countries the internal differences\r\nbetween sections of the Socialist Party have been carried to far greater\r\nlengths than have ever been known in England. In France there have been\r\nhostile groups of Socialist representatives in the Chamber of Deputies\r\nand constant internecine opposition in electoral campaigns. In Great\r\nBritain the rivalry of different societies has consisted for the most\r\npart in separate schemes of propaganda, in occasional bickerings in\r\ntheir publications, in squabbles over local elections, and sometimes\r\nover the selection but not the election of parliamentary candidates. On\r\nthe other hand co-operation on particular problems and exchange of\r\ncourtesies have been common.\r\n\r\nThe International Socialist Bureau, under instructions from the\r\nCopenhagen Conference had made a successful attempt to unite the warring\r\nelements of French Socialism, and in the autumn of 1912 the three\r\nBritish Socialist Societies were approached with a view to a conference\r\nwith the Bureau on the subject of Socialist unity in Great Britain.\r\nConvenient dates could not be fixed, and the matter was dropped, but in\r\nJuly, 1913, M. Vandervelde, the Chairman, and M. Camille Huysmans, the\r\nSecretary of the Bureau, came over from Brussels and a hurried meeting\r\nof delegates assembled in the Fabian office to discuss their proposals.\r\nThe Bureau had the good sense to recognise that the way to unity led\r\nthrough the Labour Party; and it was agreed that the three Socialist\r\nbodies should form a United Socialist Council, subject to the condition\r\nthat the British Socialist Party should affiliate to the Labour Party.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1913, a formal conference was held in London, attended on\r\nthis occasion by all the members of the International Socialist Bureau,\r\nrepresenting the Socialist parties of twenty different countries. The\r\ncrux of the question was to find a form of words which satisfied all\r\nsusceptibilities; and Sidney Webb, who was chosen chairman of a part of\r\nthe proceedings when the British delegates met by themselves to\r\nformulate the terms of agreement, was here in his element; for it would\r\nbe hard to find anybody in England more skilful in solving the\r\ndifficulties that arise in determining the expression of a proposition\r\nof which the substance is not in dispute.\r\n\r\nAn agreement was arrived at that the Joint Socialist Council should be\r\nformed as soon as the British Socialist Party was affiliated to the\r\nLabour Party. The B.S.P. confirmed the decision of its delegates, but\r\nthe Labour Party referred the acceptance of affiliation to the Annual\r\nConference of 1915[39].\r\n\r\nThen came the War. The Labour Party Conference of 1915 did not take\r\nplace, and a sudden new divergence of opinion arose in the Socialist\r\nmovement. The Labour Party, the Fabian Society, and the leaders of the\r\nB.S.P. gave general support to the Government in entering into the war.\r\nThe I.L.P. adopted an attitude of critical hostility. Amidst this\r\nsomewhat unexpected regrouping of parties, any attempt to inaugurate a\r\nUnited Socialist Council was foredoomed to failure. The project for\r\nSocialist Unity therefore awaits the happy time when war shall have\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[39] The Labour Party Conference held in January, 1916, unanimously\r\naccepted the affiliation of the British Socialist Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\nThe Minority Report, Syndicalism and Research: 1909-15\r\n\r\n   The emergence of Mrs. Sidney Webb--The Poor Law Commission--The\r\n   Minority Report--Unemployment--The National Committee for the\r\n   Prevention of Destitution--\"Vote against the House of Lords\"--Bernard\r\n   Shaw retires--Death of Hubert Bland--Opposition to the National\r\n   Insurance Bill--The Fabian Reform Committee--The \"New Statesman\"--The\r\n   Research Department--\"The Rural Problem\"--\"The Control of\r\n   Industry\"--Syndicalism--The Guildsmen--Final Statistics--The War.\r\n\r\n\r\nA former chapter was entitled \"The Episode of Mr. Wells.\" The present\r\nmight have been called \"The Intervention of Mrs. Sidney Webb,\" save for\r\nthe fact that it would suggest a comparison which might be misleading.\r\n\r\nI have insisted with some iteration that the success of the Society,\r\nboth in its early days and afterwards, must be mainly attributed to the\r\nexceptional force and ability of the Essayists. Later in its history\r\nonly two persons have come forward who are in my opinion entitled in\r\ntheir Fabian work to rank with the original leaders, to wit, Mr. Wells\r\nand Mrs. Webb. Of the former I have said enough already. The present\r\nchapter will be largely devoted to the influence of the latter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. SIDNEY WEBB, IN 1909]\r\n\r\nIt must however be observed that in all their achievements it is\r\nimpossible to make a clear distinction between Mrs. Webb and her\r\nhusband. For example, the Minority Report of the Poor Law Commission,\r\nshortly to be dealt with, purported to be the work of Mrs. Webb and\r\nher three co-signatories. In fact the investigation, the invention, and\r\nthe conclusions were in the fullest sense joint, although the draft\r\nwhich went to the typist was in the handwriting of Mr. Webb. On some\r\noccasions at any rate Mrs. Webb lectures from notes in her husband's\r\neminently legible handwriting: her own--oddly unlike her character--is\r\nindecipherable without prolonged scrutiny even by herself. Sometimes, on\r\nthe other hand, it is possible to separate the work of the two. Mrs.\r\nWebb, although elected a member in 1893, took practically no part in the\r\nFabian Society until 1906. It may be said, with substantial if not\r\nliteral accuracy, that her only contributions to the Society for the\r\nfirst dozen years of her membership were a couple of lectures and Tract\r\nNo. 67, \"Women and the Factory Acts.\" The Suffrage movement and the\r\nWells episode brought her to our meetings, and her lecture in \"The Faith\r\nI Hold\" series, a description of her upbringing amongst the captains of\r\nindustry who built some of the world's great railways, was amongst the\r\nmost memorable in the long Fabian series. Still she neither held nor\r\nsought any official position; and the main work of a Society is\r\nnecessarily done by the few who sit at its Committees often twice or\r\nthrice a week.\r\n\r\nThe transformation of Mrs. Webb from a student and writer, a typical\r\n\"socialist of the chair,\" into an active leader and propagandist\r\noriginated in December, 1905, when she was appointed a member of the\r\nRoyal Commission on the Poor Law. The Fabian Society had nothing to do\r\nwith the Commission during its four years of enquiry, though as usual\r\nnot a few Fabians took part in the work, both officially and\r\nunofficially. But when in the spring of 1909 the Minority Report was\r\nissued, signed by Mrs. Webb and George Lansbury, both members of the\r\nSociety, as well as by the Rev. Russell Wakefield (now the Bishop of\r\nBirmingham) and Mr. F. Chandler, Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of\r\nCarpenters and Joiners, the Society took it up. Mr. and Mrs. Webb\r\nreprinted the Minority Report with an introduction and notes in two\r\noctavo volumes, and they lent the Society the plates for a paper edition\r\nin two parts at a shilling and two shillings, one dealing with\r\nUnemployment and the other with the reconstruction of the Poor Law, some\r\n6000 copies of which were sold at a substantial profit.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury Solicitor was rash enough to threaten us with an injunction\r\non the ground of infringement of the Crown copyright and to demand an\r\ninstant withdrawal of our edition. But Government Departments which try\r\nconclusions with the Fabian Society generally find the Society better\r\ninformed than themselves; and we were able triumphantly to refer the\r\nTreasury Solicitor to a published declaration of his own employers, the\r\nLords Commissioners of the Treasury, a score of years before, in which\r\nthey expressly disclaimed their privilege of copyright monopoly so far\r\nas ordinary blue books were concerned, and actually encouraged the\r\nreprinting of them for the public advantage. And, with characteristic\r\nimpudence, we intimated also that, if the Government wished to try the\r\nissue, it might find that the legal copyright was not in the Crown at\r\nall, as the actual writer of the Report, to whom alone the law gives\r\ncopyright, had never ceded his copyright and was not a member of the\r\nRoyal Commission at all! At the same time we prepared to get the utmost\r\nadvertisement out of the attempt to suppress the popular circulation of\r\nthe Report, and we made this fact known to the Prime Minister. In the\r\nend the Treasury Solicitor had to climb down and withdraw his objection.\r\nWhat the Government did was to undercut us by publishing a still\r\ncheaper edition, which did not stop our sales, and thus the public\r\nbenefited by our enterprise, and an enormous circulation was obtained\r\nfor the Report.\r\n\r\nThe Minority Report of the Poor Law Commission--although never, from\r\nfirst to last, mentioning Socialism--was a notable and wholly original\r\naddition to Socialist theory, entirely of Fabian origin. Hitherto all\r\nSocialist writings on the organisation of society, whether contemporary\r\nor Utopian, had visualised a world composed exclusively of healthy,\r\nsane, and effective citizens, mostly adults. No Socialist had stopped to\r\nthink out how, in a densely populated and highly industrialised\r\nSocialist community, we should provide systematically for the orphans,\r\nthe sick, the physically or mentally defective and the aged on the one\r\nhand, and for the adults for whom at any time no immediate employment\r\ncould be found. The Minority Report, whilst making immediately\r\npracticable proposals for the reform of all the evils of the Poor Law,\r\nworked out the lines along which the necessary organisation must\r\nproceed, even in the fully socialised State. We had, in the Fabian\r\nSociety, made attempts to deal with both sides of this problem; but our\r\npublications, both on the Poor Law and on the Unemployed, had lacked the\r\nfoundation of solid fact and the discovery of new principles, which the\r\nfour years' work of the Fabians connected with the Poor Law Commission\r\nnow supplied.\r\n\r\nEnglish Socialists have always paid great and perhaps excessive\r\nattention to the problem of unemployment. Partly this is due to the fact\r\nthat Socialism came to the front in Great Britain at a period when\r\nunemployment was exceptionally rife, and when for the first time in the\r\nnineteenth century the community had become acutely aware of it. In our\r\nearly days it was commonly believed to be a rapidly growing evil.\r\nMachinery was replacing men: the capitalists would employ a few hands to\r\nturn the machines on and off: wealth would be produced for the rich, and\r\nmost of the present manual working class would become superfluous. The\r\nonly reply, so far as I know, to this line of argumentative forecast is\r\nthat it does not happen. The world is at present so avid of wealth, so\r\neager for more things to use or consume, that however quickly iron and\r\ncopper replace flesh and blood, the demand for men keeps pace with it.\r\nAnyway, unemployment in the twentieth century has so far been less\r\nprevalent than it was in the nineteenth, and nobody now suggests, as did\r\nMrs. Besant in 1889, that the increasing army of the unemployed,\r\nprovided with work by the State, would ultimately oust the employees of\r\nprivate capitalism. Unemployment in fact is at least as old as the days\r\nof Queen Elizabeth, when the great Poor Law of 1601 was passed to cope\r\nwith it. Whilst labour was scattered and the artisan still frequently\r\nhis own master, unemployment was indefinite and relatively\r\nimperceptible. When masses of men and women came to be employed in\r\nfactories, the closing of the factory made unemployment obvious to those\r\non the spot. But two generations ago Lancashire and Yorkshire were far\r\naway from London, and the nation as a whole knew little and cared less\r\nabout hard times amongst cotton operatives or iron-workers in the remote\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nIt may be said with fair accuracy that Unemployment was scarcely\r\nrecognised as a social problem before the last quarter of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, though in fact it had existed for centuries, and had been\r\nprevalent for fifty years. Mill in his \"Political Economy,\" which treats\r\nso sympathetically of the state of labour under capitalism, has no\r\nreference to it in the elaborate table of contents. Indeed the word\r\nunemployment is so recent as to have actually been unknown before the\r\nearly nineties[40].\r\n\r\nBut the Trade Unionists had always been aware of unemployment, since,\r\nafter strike pay, it is \"out-of-work benefit\" which they have found the\r\nbest protection for the standard rate of wages, and nothing in the\r\nprogram of Socialism appealed to them more directly than its claim to\r\nabolish unemployment. Finally it may be said that unemployment is on the\r\nwhole more prevalent in Great Britain than elsewhere; the system of\r\ncasual or intermittent employment is more widespread; throughout the\r\nContinent the working classes in towns are nearly everywhere connected\r\nwith the rural peasant landowners or occupiers, so that the town\r\nlabourer can often go back to the land at any rate for his keep; whilst\r\nall America, still predominantly agricultural, is in something like a\r\nsimilar case.\r\n\r\nThe Fabian Society had since its earliest days been conscious of the\r\nproblem of unemployment; but it had done little to solve it. The \"Report\r\non the Government Organisation of Unemployed Labour,\" printed \"for the\r\ninformation of members\" in 1886, had been long forgotten, and an attempt\r\nto revise it made some time in the nineties had come to nothing. In\r\n\"Fabian Essays\" unemployment is rightly recognised as the Achilles heel\r\nof the proletarian system, but the practical problem is not solved or\r\neven thoroughly understood; the plausible error of supposing that the\r\nunemployed baker and bootmaker can be set to make bread and boots for\r\none another still persists. In 1893 we reprinted from the \"Nineteenth\r\nCentury\" as Tract No. 47 a paper on \"The Unemployed\" by John Burns, and\r\nwe had published nothing else.\r\n\r\nIn fact we found the subject too difficult. There were plenty of\r\npalliatives familiar to every social enquirer; Socialism, the\r\norganisation of industry by the community for the community, we regarded\r\nas the real and final remedy. But between the former, such as labour\r\nbureaux, farm colonies, afforestation, the eight hours day, which\r\nadmittedly were at best only partial and temporary, and Socialism, which\r\nwas obviously far off, there was a great gulf fixed, and how to bridge\r\nit we knew not. At last the Minority Report provided an answer. It was a\r\ncomprehensive and practicable scheme for preventing unemployment under\r\nexisting conditions, and for coping with the mass of incompetent\r\ndestitution which for generations had Been the disgrace of our\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nInto the details of this scheme I must not enter because it is, properly\r\nspeaking, outside the scope of this book. The propaganda for carrying\r\nthe Report into effect was undertaken by the National Committee for the\r\nPrevention of Destitution, established by Mrs. Webb as a separate\r\norganisation. The necessity for this step was significant of the extent\r\nto which Socialism, as it crystallises into practical measures, invades\r\nthe common body of British thought. People who would not dream of\r\ncalling themselves Socialists, much less contributing to the funds of a\r\nSocialist Society, become enthusiastically interested in separate parts\r\nof its program as soon as it has a program, provided these parts are\r\npresented on their own merits and not as approaches to Socialism. Indeed\r\nmany who regard Socialism as a menace to society are so anxious to find\r\nand support alternatives to it, that they will endow expensive\r\nSocialistic investigations and subscribe to elaborate Socialistic\r\nschemes of reform under the impression that nothing that is thoughtful,\r\npractical, well informed, and constitutional can possibly have any\r\nconnection with the Red Spectre which stands in their imagination for\r\nSocialism. To such people the Minority Report, a document obviously the\r\nwork of highly skilled and disinterested political thinkers and experts,\r\nwould recommend itself as the constitutional basis of a Society for the\r\nPrevention of Destitution: that is, of the condition which not only\r\nsmites the conscientious rich with a compunction that no special\r\npleading by arm-chair economists can allay, but which offers a hotbed to\r\nthe sowers of Socialism. Add to these the considerable number of\r\nconvinced or half-convinced Socialists who for various reasons are not\r\nin a position to make a definite profession of Socialism without great\r\ninconvenience, real or imaginary, to themselves, and it will be plain\r\nthat Mrs. Webb would have been throwing away much of her available\r\nresources if she had not used the device of a new organisation to\r\nagitate for the Minority Report _ad hoc_.\r\n\r\nMany Fabians served on the Committee--indeed a large proportion of our\r\nmembers must have taken part in its incessant activities--and the\r\nrelations between the two bodies were close; but most of the subscribers\r\nto the Committee and many of its most active members came from outside\r\nthe Society, and were in no way committed to its general principles.\r\n\r\nFor two whole years Mrs. Webb managed her Committee with great vigour\r\nand dash. She collected for it a considerable income and a large number\r\nof workers: she lectured and organised all over the country; she\r\ndiscovered that she was an excellent propagandist, and that what she\r\ncould do with success she also did with zest.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1911 Mr. and Mrs. Webb left England for a tour round\r\nthe world, and Mrs. Webb had mentioned before she left that she was\r\nwilling to be nominated for the Executive. At the election in April,\r\n1912, whilst still abroad, she was returned second on the poll, with 778\r\nvotes, only a dozen behind her husband.\r\n\r\nFrom this point onwards Mrs. Webb has been on the whole the dominant\r\npersonality in the Society This does not necessarily mean that she is\r\nabler or stronger than her husband or Bernard Shaw. But the latter had\r\nwithdrawn from the Executive Committee, and the former, with the rest of\r\nthe Old Gang, had made the Society what it already was. Mrs. Webb\r\nbrought a fresh and fertile mind to its councils. Her twenty years of\r\nmembership and intimate private acquaintance with its leaders made her\r\nfamiliar with its possibilities, but she was free from the influence of\r\npast failures--in such matters for example as Socialist Unity--and she\r\nwas eager to start out on new lines which the almost unconscious\r\ntraditions of the Society had hitherto barred.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe story of the Society has been traced to the conclusion of the\r\nintervention of Mr. Wells, and I then turned aside to describe the\r\nnumerous new activities of the booming years which followed the Labour\r\nParty triumph of 1906. I must now complete the history of the internal\r\naffairs of the Society.\r\n\r\nAs a political body, the Society has usually, though not invariably,\r\nissued some sort of pronouncement on the eve of a General Election. In\r\nJanuary, 1910, the Executive Committee published in \"Fabian News\" a\r\nbrief manifesto addressed to the members urging them to \"Vote against\r\nthe House of Lords.\" It will be recollected that the Lords had rejected\r\nthe Budget, and the sole issue before the country was the right of the\r\nHouse of Commons to control finance. Members were urged to support any\r\nduly accredited Labour or socialist candidate; elsewhere they were, in\r\neffect, advised to vote for the Liberal candidates. In April their\r\naction in publishing this \"Special advice to members\" without the\r\nconsent of a members' meeting was challenged, but the Executive\r\nCommittee's contention that it was entitled to advise the members, and\r\nthat the advice given was sound, was endorsed by a very large majority.\r\n\r\nAt the Annual Meeting the Executive Committee, with a view to setting\r\nforth once more their reasoned view on a subject of perennial trouble to\r\nnew members, accepted a resolution instructing them to consider and\r\nreport on the advisability of limiting the liberty of members to support\r\npolitical parties other than Labour or Socialist, and on November 4th\r\nR.C.K. Ensor on behalf of the Executive gave an admirable address on\r\nFabian Policy. He explained that the Society had never set out to become\r\na political party, and that in this respect it differed in the most\r\nmarked manner from most Socialist bodies. Its collective support of the\r\nLabour Party combined with toleration of Liberals suited a world of real\r\nmen who can seldom be arranged on tidy and geometrical lines. This\r\nreport was accepted by general consent, and in December, when Parliament\r\nwas again dissolved, this time on the question of the Veto of the Lords,\r\nthe Executive repeated their \"Advice to Members\" to vote for Liberals\r\nwhenever no properly accredited Labour or Socialist candidate was in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the dissatisfaction with the old policy, and with its old exponents,\r\nwas not yet dispelled. A new generation was knocking at the door, and\r\nsome of the old leaders thought that the time had come to make room for\r\nthem. Hubert Bland was suffering from uncertain health, and he made up\r\nhis mind to retire from the official positions he had held since the\r\nformation of the Society. Bernard Shaw determined to join him and then\r\nsuggested the same course to the rest of his contemporaries. Some of\r\nthem concurred, and in addition to the two already named R.C.K. Ensor\r\n(who returned a year later), Stewart Headlam, and George Standring\r\nwithdrew from the Executive in order to make room for younger members.\r\nTwenty-two new candidates came forward at the election of April, 1911;\r\nbut on the whole the Society showed no particular eagerness for change.\r\nThe retiring members were re-elected ahead of all the new ones, with\r\nSidney Webb at the top of the poll, and the five additions to the\r\nExecutive, Emil Davies, Mrs. C.M. Wilson, Reginald Bray, L.C.C., Mrs. F.\r\nCavendish Bentinck, and Henry D. Harben, were none of them exactly\r\nyouthful or ardent innovators.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was apparent that the self-denying ordinance of the\r\nveterans was not really necessary, and the Executive, loath to lose the\r\nstimulation of Shaw's constant presence, devised a scheme to authorise\r\nthe elected members to co-opt as consultative members persons who had\r\nalready held office for ten years and had retired. The Executive itself\r\nwas by no means unanimous on this policy, and at the Annual Meeting one\r\nof them, Henry H. Slesser, led the opposition to any departure from \"the\r\nprinciples of pure democracy.\" On a show of hands the proposal appeared\r\nto be defeated by a small majority, and in the face of the opposition\r\nwas withdrawn. This is almost the only occasion on which the Executive\r\nCommittee have failed to carry their policy through the Society, and\r\nthey might have succeeded even in this instance, either at the meeting\r\nor on a referendum, if they had chosen to insist on an alteration in the\r\nconstitution against the wishes of a substantial fraction of the\r\nmembership.\r\n\r\nHere then it may be said that the rule of the essayists as a body came\r\nto an end. Sidney Webb alone remained in office. Hubert Bland was in\r\nrapidly declining health. Only once again he addressed the Society, on\r\nJuly 16th, 1912, when he examined the history of \"Fabian Policy,\" and\r\nindicated the changes which he thought should be made to adapt it to new\r\nconditions. Soon after this his sight completely failed, and in April,\r\n1914, he died suddenly of long-standing heart disease.\r\n\r\nBernard Shaw happily for the Society has not ceased to concern himself\r\nin its activities, although he is no longer officially responsible for\r\ntheir management. His freedom from office does not always make the task\r\nof his successors easier. The loyalest of colleagues, he had always\r\ndefended their policy, whether or not it was exactly of his own choice;\r\nbut in his capacity of private member his unrivalled influence is\r\noccasionally something of a difficulty. If he does not happen to approve\r\nof what the Executive proposes he can generally persuade a Business\r\nMeeting to vote for something else!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt this same period, the spring of 1911, the National Insurance Bill was\r\nintroduced. This was a subject to which the Society had given but little\r\nattention and on which it had not formulated a policy. It had opposed\r\nthe contributory system as proposed to be applied to Old Age Pensions,\r\nand a paper on \"Paupers and Old Age Pensions,\" published by Sidney Webb\r\nin the \"Albany Review\" in August, 1907, and reprinted by the Society as\r\nTract No. 135, had probably much influence in deciding the Government\r\nto abandon its original plan of excluding paupers permanently from the\r\nscheme by showing what difficulties and anomalies would follow from any\r\nsuch course. The National Insurance Bill when first introduced was\r\nseverely criticised by Sidney Webb in documents circulated amongst Trade\r\nUnionists and published in various forms; but a few weeks later he\r\nstarted on his tour round the world and could take no further part in\r\nthe affair. At the Annual Conference of Fabian Societies in July, 1911,\r\nan amendment proposed by H.D. Harben to a resolution dealing with the\r\nBill was carried against a small minority. The amendment declared that\r\nthe Bill should be opposed, and in furtherance of the policy thus\r\ncasually suggested and irregularly adopted, the Executive Committee\r\njoined with a section of the I.L.P. in a vigorous campaign to defeat the\r\nBill. This was a new rôle for the Society. Usually it has adopted the\r\nprinciple of accepting and making the best of what has already happened;\r\nand in politics a Bill introduced by a strong Government is a _fait\r\naccompli_; it is too late to say that something else would have been\r\npreferable. It may be amended: it may possibly be withdrawn: it cannot\r\nbe exchanged for another scheme.\r\n\r\nI shall not however dwell on this episode in Fabian history because for\r\nonce I was in complete disagreement with all my colleagues, except Sir\r\nLeo Chiozza Money, and perhaps I cannot yet view the matter with entire\r\ndetachment. The Labour Party decided to meet the Bill with friendly\r\ncriticism, to recognise it as great measure of social reform, and to\r\nadvocate amendments which they deemed improvements. The Fabian Society\r\nattacked the Bill with hostile amendments, prophesied all sorts of\r\ncalamities as certain to result from it: magnified its administrative\r\ndifficulties, and generally encouraged the duchesses and farmers who\r\npassively resisted it; but their endeavour to defeat the Bill was a\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nIt may be too soon to be confident that the policy of the Society in\r\nthis matter was wrong. But the Trade Unions are stronger than ever: the\r\nFriendly Societies are not bankrupt: the working people are insured\r\nagainst sickness: and anybody who now proposed to repeal the Act would\r\nbe regarded as a lunatic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the withdrawal of some of the older had by no means satisfied\r\nthe younger generation, and during the autumn of 1911 a Fabian Reform\r\nCommittee was constituted, with Henry H. Slesser as Chairman, Dr. Marion\r\nPhillips as Vice-Chairman, Clifford Allen as Secretary, and fifteen\r\nother members, including Dr. Ethel Bentham, who, like Mr. Slesser, was a\r\nmember of the Executive. Their programme, like that of Mr. Wells,\r\nincluded a number of reforms of procedure, none of them of much\r\nconsequence; and a political policy, which was to insist \"that if\r\nFabians do take part in politics, they should do so only as supporters\r\nof the Labour Party.\"[41] The campaign of the Committee lasted a year,\r\nand as usual in such cases led to a good deal of somewhat heated\r\ncontroversy over matters which now appear to be very trivial. It is\r\ntherefore not worth while to recount the details of the proceedings,\r\nwhich can be found by any enquirer in the pages of \"Fabian News.\" Two of\r\nthe leaders, Dr. Marion Phillips and Clifford Allen, were elected to the\r\nExecutive at the election of 1912, and some of the administrative\r\nreforms proposed by the Committee were carried into effect. The\r\nReformers elected to fight the battle of political policy on point of\r\ndetail, until in July, 1912, the Executive Committee resolved to bring\r\nthe matter to an issue, and to that end moved at a members' meeting:\r\n\"That this meeting endorses the constitutional practice of the Society\r\nwhich accords complete toleration to its members; and whilst reaffirming\r\nits loyalty to the Labour Party, to which party alone it as a society\r\nhas given support, it declines to interfere ... with the right of each\r\nmember to decide on the manner in which he can best work for Socialism\r\nin accordance with his individual opportunities and circumstances.\" (The\r\nphrase omitted refers to the rule about expulsion of members, a\r\nsafeguard which in fact has never been resorted to.) An amendment of the\r\nReformers embodying their policy was defeated by 122 to 27 and after the\r\nholiday season the Reform Committed announced that their mission was\r\naccomplished and their organisation had been disbanded[42].\r\n\r\n\"Fabian Reform\" embodied no new principle all through the history of the\r\nSociety there had been a conflict between the \"constitutional practice\"\r\nof political toleration, and the desire of a militant minority to set up\r\na standard of party orthodoxy, and to penalise or expel the dissenters\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nThe next storm which disturbed Fabian equanimity involved an altogether\r\nnew principle, and was therefore a refreshing change to the veterans,\r\nwho were growing weary of winning battles fought over the same ground.\r\nIn order to explain this movement it is necessary to describe a new\r\ndevelopment in the work of the Society.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1912 Mrs. Webb came to the conclusion that the work of\r\nthe National Committee for the Prevention of Destitution could not be\r\ncarried on indefinitely on a large scale. Reform of the Poor Law was\r\nnot coming as a big scheme. It was true that the Majority Report was\r\nalmost forgotten, but there appeared to be no longer any hope that the\r\nGovernment would take up as a whole the scheme of the Minority Report.\r\nIt would come about in due time, but not as the result of an agitation.\r\nThe National Committee had a monthly paper, \"The Crusade,\" edited by\r\nClifford Sharp, a member of the Society who came to the front at the\r\ntime of the Wells agitation, had been one of the founders of the\r\nNursery, and a member of the Executive from 1909 to 1914. In March,\r\n1913, Bernard Shaw, H.D. Harben, and the Webbs, with a few other\r\nfriends, established the \"New Statesman,\" with Clifford Sharp as editor.\r\nThis weekly review is not the organ of the Society, and is not in any\r\nformal way connected with it, but none the less it does in fact express\r\nthe policy which has moulded the Society, and it has been a useful\r\nvehicle for publishing the results of Fabian Research.\r\n\r\nFabian Research, the other outgrowth of the Committee for the Prevention\r\nof Destitution, was organised by Mrs. Webb in the autumn of 1912.\r\nInvestigation of social problems was one of the original objects of the\r\nSociety and had always been a recognised part of its work. As a general\r\nrule, members had taken it up individually, but at various periods\r\nCommittees had been appointed to investigate particular subjects. The\r\nimportant work of one of these Committees, on the Decline of the\r\nBirth-rate, has been described in an earlier chapter. Mrs. Webb's plan\r\nwas to systematise research, to enlist the co-operation of social\r\nenquirers not necessarily committed to the principles of the Society,\r\nand to obtain funds for this special purpose from those who would not\r\ncontribute to the political side of the Society's operations.\r\n\r\nThe \"Committees of Inquiry\" then formed took up two subjects, the\r\n\"Control of Industry\" and \"Land Problems and Rural Development.\" The\r\nlatter was organised by H.D. Harben and was carried on independently.\r\nAfter a large amount of information had been collected, partly in\r\nwriting and partly from the oral evidence of specialists, a Report was\r\ndrafted by Mr. Harben and published first as a Supplement to the \"New\r\nStatesman\" on August 4th, 1913, and some months later by Messrs.\r\nConstable for the Fabian Society as a half-a-crown volume entitled \"The\r\nRural Problem.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact there is a consensus of opinion throughout all parties on this\r\ngroup of questions. Socialists, Liberals, and a large section of\r\nConservatives advocate Wages Boards for providing a statutory minimum\r\nwage for farm labourers, State aid for building of cottages and a\r\nresolute speeding up in the provision of land for small holdings. The\r\nFabian presentment of the case did not substantially differ from that of\r\nthe Land Report published a few months later under Liberal auspices, and\r\nour Report, though useful, cannot be said to have been epoch-making.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Enquiry into the Control of Industry was developing on\r\nwider lines. The Research Department set up its own office and staff,\r\nand began to collect information about all the methods of control of\r\nindustry at present existing as alternatives to the normal capitalist\r\nsystem. Co-operation in all its forms, the resistances of Trade\r\nUnionism, the effects of professional organisations, such as those of\r\nthe Teachers and of the Engineers, and all varieties of State and\r\nMunicipal enterprise were investigated in turn; several reports have\r\nbeen published as \"New Statesman\" Supplements, and a volume or series of\r\nvolumes will in due time appear.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the Control of Industry had become important because of\r\nthe rise of a new school of thought amongst Socialists, especially in\r\nFrance, where the rapid growth of Trade Unionism since 1884, combined\r\nwith profound distrust of the group system of party politics, had led to\r\na revival of old-fashioned anarchism in a new form. Syndicalism, which\r\nis the French word for Trade Unionism, proposes that the future State\r\nshould be organised on the basis of Trade Unions; it regards a man's\r\noccupation as more vitally important to him than his place of residence,\r\nand therefore advocates representation by trades in place of localities:\r\nit lays stress on his desire, his right, to control his own working life\r\ndirectly through his own elected representatives of his trade: it\r\ncriticises the \"servile state\" proposed by collectivists, wherein the\r\nworkman, it is said, would be a wage-slave to officials of the State, as\r\nhe is now to officials of the capitalists. Thus it proposes that the\r\ncontrol of industry should be in the hands of the producers, and not, as\r\nat present, in the hands of consumers through capitalists catering for\r\ntheir custom, or through co-operative societies of consumers, or through\r\nthe State acting on behalf of citizens who are consumers.\r\n\r\nA quite extraordinary diversity of streams of opinion converged to give\r\nvolume to this new trend of thought. There was the literary criticism of\r\nMr. Hilaire Belloc, whose ideal is the peasant proprietor of France,\r\nfreed from governmental control, a self-sufficient producer of all his\r\nrequirements. His attack was directed against the Servile State,\r\nsupposed to be foreshadowed by the Minority Report, which proposed\r\ndrastic collective control over the derelicts of our present social\r\nanarchy. Then Mr. Tom Mann came back from Australia as the prophet of\r\nthe new proletarian gospel, and for a few months attracted working-class\r\nattention by his energy and eloquence. The South Wales miners, after\r\nmany years of acquiescence in the rule of successful and highly\r\nrespected but somewhat old-fashioned leaders, were awakening to a sense\r\nof power, and demanding from their Unions a more aggressive policy. The\r\nparliamentary Labour Party since 1910 had resolved to support the\r\nLiberal Government in its contest with the House of Lords and in its\r\ndemand for Irish Home Rule, and as Labour support was essential to the\r\ncontinuance of the Liberals in power, they were debarred from pushing\r\ntheir own proposals regardless of consequences. Although therefore the\r\nparty was pledged to the demand for Women's Franchise, they refused to\r\nwreck the Government on its behalf. Hence impatient Socialists and\r\nextreme Suffragists united in proclaiming that the Labour Party was no\r\nlonger of any use, and that \"direct action\" by Suffragettes and Trade\r\nUnionists was the only method of progress. The \"Daily Herald,\" a\r\nnewspaper started by a group of compositors in London, was acquired by\r\npartisans of this policy, and as long as it lived incessantly derided\r\nthe Labour Party and advocated Women's Franchise and some sort of\r\nSyndicalism as the social panacea. Moreover a variant on Syndicalism, of\r\na more reasoned and less revolutionary character, called \"Guild\r\nSocialism,\" was proposed by Mr. A.R. Orage in the pages of his weekly,\r\n\"The New Age,\" and gained a following especially in Oxford, where Mr.\r\nG.D.H. Cole was leader of the University Fabian Society. His book on\r\nTrade Unionism, entitled \"The World of Labour,\" published at the end of\r\n1913, attracted much attention, and he threw himself with great energy\r\ninto the Trade Union enquiry of the Research Department, of which his\r\nfriend and ally, Mr. W. Mellor, was the Secretary. Mr. Cole was elected\r\nto the Executive Committee in April, 1914, and soon afterwards began a\r\nnew \"Reform\" movement. He had become a prophet of the \"Guild Socialism\"\r\nschool, and was at that time extremely hostile to the Labour Party.\r\nIndeed a year before, when dissatisfaction with the party was prevalent,\r\nhe had proposed at a business meeting that the Fabian Society should\r\ndisaffiliate, but he had failed to carry his resolution by 92 votes\r\nagainst 48. In the summer of 1914 however he arrived at an understanding\r\nwith Mr. Clifford Allen, also a member of the Executive, and with other\r\nout and out supporters of the Labour Party, by which they agreed to\r\ncombine their altogether inconsistent policies into a single new program\r\nfor the Fabian Society. The program of the \"several schools of thought,\"\r\npublished in \"Fabian News\" for April, 1915, laid down that the object of\r\nthe Society should be to carry out research, that the Basis should be\r\nreplaced merely by the phrase, \"The Fabian Society consists of\r\nSocialists and forms part of the national and international movement for\r\nthe emancipation of the community from the capitalist system\"; and that\r\na new rule should be adopted forbidding members to belong to, or\r\npublicly to associate with, any organisation opposed to that movement of\r\nwhich this Society had declared itself a part. The Executive Committee\r\npublished a lengthy rejoinder, and at the election of the Executive\r\nCommittee a few weeks later the members by their votes clearly indicated\r\ntheir disapproval of the new scheme. At the Annual Meeting in May, 1915,\r\nonly small minorities supported the plan of reconstruction, and Mr. Cole\r\nthen and there resigned his membership of the Society, and was\r\nsubsequently followed by a few other members. A little while later the\r\nOxford University Fabian Society severed its connection with the parent\r\nSociety, and Mr. Cole adopted the wise course of founding a society of\r\nhis own for the advocacy of Guild Socialism.\r\n\r\nThis episode brings the history of the Society down to the present\r\ndate, and I shall conclude this chapter with a brief account of its\r\norganisation at the time of writing, the summer of 1915.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1913 my own long term of service as chief officer of the\r\nSociety came to an end, and my colleague for several previous years, W.\r\nStephen Sanders, was appointed my successor. The Executive Committee\r\nrequested me to take the new office of Honorary Secretary, and to retain\r\na share in the management of the Society. This position I still hold.\r\n\r\nThe tide of Socialist progress which began to rise in 1905 had turned\r\nbefore 1914, and the period of depression was intensified by the war,\r\nwhich is still the dominant fact in the world. The membership of the\r\nSociety reached its maximum in 1913, 2804 in the parent Society and\r\nabout 500 others in local societies. In 1915 the members were 2588 and\r\n250. The removal to new premises in the autumn of 1914 was more than a\r\nmere change of offices, since it provided the Society with a shop for\r\nthe sale of its publications, a hall sufficiently large for minor\r\nmeetings, and accommodation in the same house for the Research\r\nDepartment and the Women's Group. Moreover a couple of rooms were\r\nfurnished as a \"Common Room\" for members, in which light refreshments\r\ncan be obtained and Socialist publications consulted. The finances of\r\nthe Society have of course been adversely affected by the war, but not,\r\nso far, to a very material extent.\r\n\r\nThe chief new departure of recent years has been the organisation of\r\ncourses of lectures in London for the general public by Bernard Shaw,\r\nSidney Webb, and Mrs. Webb, which have not only been of value as a means\r\nof propaganda, but have also yielded a substantial profit for the\r\npurposes of the Society. The plan originated with a debate between\r\nBernard Shaw and G.K. Chesterton in 1911, which attracted a crowded\r\naudience and much popular interest. Next year Mr. Shaw debated with Mr.\r\nHilaire Belloc: in 1913 Mr. and Mrs. Webb gave six lectures at King's\r\nHall on \"Socialism Restated\": in 1914 Bernard Shaw gave another course\r\nof six at Kingsway Hall on the \"Redistribution of Income,\" in which he\r\ndeveloped the thesis that the economic goal of Socialism is equality of\r\nincome for all. Lastly, in 1915 a course of six lectures at King's Hall\r\nby the three already named on \"The World after the War\" proved to be\r\nunexpectedly successful. The lecturing to clubs and other societies\r\ncarried on by new generations of members still continues, but it forms\r\nby no means so prominent a part of the Society's work as in earlier\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nLocal Fabian organisation, as is always the case in time of depression,\r\nis on the down grade. The London groups scarcely exist, and but few\r\nlocal societies, besides that of Liverpool, show signs of life. The\r\nResearch Department, the Women's Group, and the Nursery are still\r\nactive.\r\n\r\nThe Society has an old-established tradition and a settled policy, but\r\nin fact it is not now controlled by anything like an Old Gang. The\r\nExecutive Committee numbers twenty-one: two only of these, Sidney Webb\r\nand myself, have sat upon it from its early days: only two others, Dr.\r\nLawson Dodd (the Treasurer) and W. Stephen Sanders (the General\r\nSecretary) were on the Executive during the great contest with Mr. Wells\r\nten years ago. All the rest have joined it within the last few years,\r\nand if they support the old tradition, it is because they accept it, and\r\nnot because they created it. Moreover the majority of the members are\r\nyoung people, most of them born since the Society was founded. The\r\nSociety is old, but it does not consist, in the main, of old people.\r\n\r\nWhat its future may be I shall consider in the next, and concluding,\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI must add a final paragraph to my history. At the time I write, in the\r\nfirst days of 1916, the war is with us and the end is not in sight. In\r\naccordance with the rule which forbids it to speak, unless it has\r\nsomething of value to say, the Society has made no pronouncement and\r\nadopted no policy. A resolution registering the opinion of the majority\r\nof a few hundred members assembled in a hall is not worth recording when\r\nthe subject is one in which millions are as concerned and virtually as\r\ncompetent as themselves.\r\n\r\nNaturally there is diversity of opinion amongst the members. On the one\r\nhand Mr. Clifford Allen, a member of the Executive, has played a leading\r\npart in organising opposition to conscription and opposing the policy of\r\nthe Government. On the other hand two other members of the Executive\r\nCommittee, Mr. H.J. Gillespie and Mr. C.M. Lloyd, have, since the\r\nbeginning of the war, resigned their seats in order to take commissions\r\nin the Army. Another member, the General Secretary, after months of\r\nvigorous service as one of the Labour Party delegates to Lord Derby's\r\nRecruiting Committee, accepted a commission in the Army in November,\r\n1915, in order to devote his whole time to this work, and has been\r\ngranted leave of absence for the period of the war, whilst I have\r\nundertaken my old work in his place. Many members of the Society joined\r\nthe Army in the early months of the war, and already a number, amongst\r\nwhom may be named Rupert Brooke, have given their lives for their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWARD R. PEASE, IN 1913]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[40] The editors of the Oxford English Dictionary kindly inform me that\r\nthe earliest quotation they have yet found is dated December, 1894. I\r\ncannot discover it in any Fabian publication before Tract No. 65, which\r\nwas published in July, 1895.\r\n\r\n[41] Manifesto on Fabian Policy issued by the Fabian Reform Committee, 4\r\npp., 4to, November 28th, 1911.\r\n\r\n[42] \"Fabian News,\" November, 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\nThe Lessons of Thirty Years\r\n\r\n   Breaking the spell of Marxism--A French verdict--Origin of\r\n   Revisionism in Germany--The British School of Socialism--Mr. Ernest\r\n   Barker's summary--Mill _versus_ Marx--The Fabian Method--Making\r\n   Socialists or making Socialism--The life of propagandist\r\n   societies--The prospects of Socialist Unity--The future of Fabian\r\n   ideas--The test of Fabian success.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fabian Society was founded for the purpose of reconstructing Society\r\nin accordance with the highest moral possibilities. This is still the\r\nmost accurate and compendious description of its object and the nature\r\nof its work. But the stage of idealism at which more than a very modest\r\ninstalment of this cosmic process seemed possible within the lifetime of\r\na single institution had passed before the chief Essayists became\r\nmembers, and indeed I cannot recollect that the founders themselves ever\r\nimagined that it lay within their own power to reconstruct Society; none\r\nof them was really so sanguine or so self-confident as to anticipate so\r\ngreat a result from their efforts, and it will be remembered that the\r\noriginal phrase was altered by the insertion of the words \"to help on\"\r\nwhen the constitution was actually formulated. Society has not yet been\r\nreconstructed, but the Fabians have done something towards its\r\nreconstruction, and my history will be incomplete without an attempt to\r\nindicate what the Society has already accomplished and what may be the\r\nfuture of its work.\r\n\r\nIts first achievement, as already mentioned, was to break the spell of\r\nMarxism in England. Public opinion altogether failed to recognise the\r\ngreatness of Marx during his lifetime, but every year that passes adds\r\nstrength to the conviction that the broad principles he promulgated will\r\nguide the evolution of society during the present century. Marx\r\ndemonstrated the moral bankruptcy of commercialism and formulated the\r\ndemand for the communal ownership and organisation of industry; and it\r\nis hardly possible to exaggerate the value of this service to humanity.\r\nBut no man is great enough to be made into a god; no man, however wise,\r\ncan see far into the future. Neither Marx himself nor his immediate\r\nfollowers recognised the real basis of his future fame; they thought he\r\nwas a brilliant and original economist, and a profound student of\r\nhistory. His Theory of Value, his Economic Interpretation of History,\r\nseemed to them the incontestible premises which necessarily led to his\r\npolitical conclusions. This misapprehension would not have much mattered\r\nhad they allowed themselves freedom of thought. Socialism, as first\r\npreached to the English people by the Social Democrats, was as narrow,\r\nas bigoted, as exclusive as the strictest of Scotch religious sects.\r\n\"Das Kapital,\" Vol. I, was its bible; and the thoughts and schemes of\r\nEnglish Socialists were to be approved or condemned according as they\r\ncould or could not be justified by a quoted text.\r\n\r\nThe Fabian Society freed English Socialism from this intellectual\r\nbondage, and freed it sooner and more completely than \"Revisionists\"\r\nhave succeeded in doing anywhere else.\r\n\r\nAccepting the great principle that the reconstruction of society to be\r\nworked for is the ownership and control of industry by the community,\r\nthe Fabians refused to regard as articles of faith either the economic\r\nand historic analyses which Marx made use of or the political evolution\r\nwhich he predicted.\r\n\r\nSocialism in England remained the fantastic creed of a group of fanatics\r\nuntil \"Fabian Essays\" and the Lancashire Campaign taught the working\r\nclasses of England, or at any rate their leaders, that Socialism was a\r\nliving principle which could be applied to existing social and political\r\nconditions without a cataclysm either insurrectionary or even political.\r\nRevolutionary phraseology, the language of violence, survived, and still\r\nsurvives, just as in ordinary politics we use the metaphors of warfare\r\nand pretend that the peaceful polling booth is a battlefield and that\r\nour political opponents are hostile armies. But we only wave the red\r\nflag in our songs, and we recognise nowadays that the real battles of\r\nSocialism are fought in committee rooms at Westminster and in the\r\ncouncil chambers of Town Halls.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps fortunate that none of the Fabian leaders came within the\r\ninfluence of the extraordinary personality of Karl Marx. Had he lived a\r\nfew years longer he might have dominated them as he dominated his German\r\nfollowers, and one or two of his English adherents. Then years would\r\nhave been wasted in the struggle to escape. It was fortunate also that\r\nthe Fabian Society has never possessed one single outstanding leader,\r\nand has always refrained from electing a president or permanent\r\nchairman. There never has been a Fabian orthodoxy, because no one was in\r\na position to assert what the true faith was.\r\n\r\nFreedom of thought was without doubt obtained for English Socialists by\r\nthe Fabians. How far the world-wide revolt against Marxian orthodoxy had\r\nits origin in England is another and more difficult question. In his\r\nstudy of the Fabian Society[43] M. Édouard Pfeiffer states in the\r\npreface that the Society makes this claim, quotes Bernard Shaw as saying\r\nto him, \"The world has been thoroughly Fabianised in the last\r\ntwenty-five years,\" and adds that he is going to examine the accuracy of\r\nit. Later he says:--\r\n\r\n\"Les premiers de tous les Socialistes, les Fabiens out inauguré le\r\nmouvement de critique antimarxiste: à une époque oû les dogmes du maître\r\nétaient considérés comme intangibles, les Fabiens out prétendu que l'on\r\npouvait se dire socialiste sans jamais avoir lu le Capital ou en en\r\ndésapprouvant la teneur; par opposition à Marx ils out ressuscité\r\nl'esprit de Stuart Mill et sur tous les points ils se sont attaqués à\r\nMarx, guerre des classes et materialisme historique, catastrophisme et\r\navant tout la question de la valeur-travail.\"[44]\r\n\r\nThis is a French view. Germany is naturally the stronghold of Marxism,\r\nand the country where it has proved, up to a point, an unqualified\r\nsuccess. Although the Social Democratic Party was founded as an alliance\r\nbetween the followers of Marx and of Lassalle, on terms to which Marx\r\nhimself violently objected, none the less the leadership of the party\r\nfell to those who accepted the teaching of Marx, and on that basis by\r\nfar the greatest Socialist Party of the world has been built up.\r\nNowhere else did the ideas of Marx hold such unquestioned supremacy:\r\nnowhere else had they such a body of loyal adherents, such a host of\r\nteachers and interpreters. Only on the question of agricultural land in\r\nthe freer political atmosphere of South Germany was there even a breath\r\nof dissent. The revolt came from England in the person of Edward\r\nBernstein, who, exiled by Bismarck, took refuge in London, and was for\r\nyears intimately acquainted with the Fabian Society and its leaders.\r\nSoon after his return to Germany he published in 1899 a volume\r\ncriticising Marxism,[45] and thence grew up the Revisionist movement for\r\nfree thought in Socialism which has attracted all the younger men, and\r\nbefore the war had virtually, if not actually, obtained control over the\r\nSocial Democratic Party.\r\n\r\nIn England, and in Germany through Bernstein, I think the Fabian Society\r\nmay claim to have led the revolt. Elsewhere the revolt has come rather\r\nin deeds than in words. In France, in Italy, and in Belgium and in other\r\nEuropean countries, a Socialist Party has grown up which amid greater\r\npolitical opportunities has had to face the actual problems of modern\r\npolitics. These could not be solved by quotations from a German\r\nphilosopher, and liberty has been gained by force of circumstances.\r\nNevertheless in many countries, such as Russia and the United States,\r\neven now, or at any rate until very recent years, the freedom of action\r\nof Socialist parties has been impeded by excessive respect for the\r\nopinions of the Founder, and Socialist thought has been sterilised,\r\nbecause it was assumed that Marx had completed the philosophy of\r\nSocialism, and the business of Socialists was not to think for\r\nthemselves, but merely to work for the realisation of his ideas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut mere freedom was not enough. Something must be put in the place of\r\nMarx. His English followers did not notice that he had indicated no\r\nmethod, and devised no political machinery for the transition; or if\r\nthey noticed it they passed over the omission as a negligible detail. If\r\nGerman Socialism would not suit, English Socialism had to be formulated\r\nto take its place. This has been the life-work of the Fabian Society,\r\nthe working out of the application of the broad principles of Socialism\r\nto the industrial and political environment of England. I say England\r\nadvisedly, because the industrial and political conditions of Scotland\r\nare in some degree different, and the application of the principles of\r\nSocialism to Ireland has not yet been seriously attempted. But for\r\nEngland \"Fabian Essays\" and the Fabian Tracts are by general consent the\r\nbest expositions of the meaning and working of Socialism in the English\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nMarxian Socialism regarded itself as a thing apart. Marx had discovered\r\na panacea for the ills of society: the old was to be cleared away and\r\nall things were to become new. In Marx's own thought evolution and\r\nrevolution were tangled and alternated. The evolutionary side was\r\nessential to it; the idea of revolutionary catastrophe is almost an\r\nexcrescence. But to the Marxians (of whom Marx once observed that he was\r\nnot one) this excrescence became the whole thing. People were divided\r\ninto those who advocated the revolution and those who did not. The\r\nbusiness of propaganda was to increase the number of adherents of the\r\nnew at the expense of the supporters of the old.\r\n\r\nThe Fabians regarded Socialism as a principle already in part embodied\r\nin the constitution of society, gradually extending its influence\r\nbecause it harmonised with the needs and desires of men in countries\r\nwhere the large industry prevails.\r\n\r\nFabian Socialism is in fact an interpretation of the spirit of the\r\ntimes. I have pointed out already that the municipalisation of\r\nmonopolies, a typically Fabian process, had its origin decades before\r\nthe Society was founded, and all that the Fabian Society did was to\r\nexplain its social implications and advocate its wider extension. The\r\nsame is true of the whole Fabian political policy. Socialism in English\r\npolitics grew up because of the necessity for State intervention in the\r\ncomplex industrial and social organisation of a Great State. Almost\r\nbefore the evil results of Laissez Faire had culminated Robert Owen was\r\npointing the way to factory legislation, popular education, and the\r\ncommunal care of children. The Ten Hours Act of 1847 was described by\r\nMarx himself as \"the victory of a principle,\" that is, of \"the political\r\neconomy of the working class.\"[46] That victory was frequently repeated\r\nin the next thirty years, and collective protection of Labour in the\r\nform of Factory Acts, Sanitary Acts, Truck Acts, Employers' Liability\r\nActs, and Trade Board Acts became a recognised part of the policy of\r\nboth political parties.\r\n\r\nFabian teaching has had more direct influence in promoting the\r\nadministrative protection of Labour. The Fair Wages policy, now\r\neverywhere prevalent in State and Municipal employment, was, as has been\r\nalready described, if not actually invented, at any rate largely\r\npopularised by the Society. It was a working-class demand, and it has\r\nbeen everywhere put forward by organised labour, but its success would\r\nhave been slower had the manual workers been left to fight their own\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nI have said that the work of the Society was the interpretation of an\r\nexisting movement, the explanation and justification of tendencies which\r\noriginated in Society at large, and not in societies, Fabian or other.\r\nThat work is only less valuable than the formulation of new ideas. None\r\nof the Fabians would claim to rank beside the great promulgators of new\r\nideas, such as Owen and Marx. But the interpretation of tendencies is\r\nnecessary if progress is to be sustained and if it is to be unbroken by\r\ncasual reaction. In an old country like ours, with vast forces of\r\ninertia built up by ages of precedents, by a class system which forms a\r\npart of the life of the nation, by a distribution of wealth which even\r\nyet scarcely yields to the pressure of graduated taxation, legislation\r\nis always in arrear of the needs of the times; the social structure is\r\nalways old-fashioned and out of date, and reform always tends to be\r\nlate, and even too late, unless there are agitators with the ability to\r\nattract public attention calling on the men in power to take action.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut this victory of a principle is not a complete victory of the\r\nprinciples of Socialism. It is a limitation of the power of the\r\ncapitalist to use his capital as he pleases, and Socialism is much more\r\nthan a series of social safeguards to the private ownership of capital.\r\nMunicipal ownership is a further step, but even this will not carry us\r\nfar because the capital suitable for municipal management on existing\r\nlines is but a small fraction of the whole, and because municipal\r\ncontrol does not directly affect the amount of capital in the hands of\r\nthe capitalists who are always expropriated with ample compensation.\r\n\r\nWe have made some progress along another line. Supertax, death duties,\r\nand taxes on unearned increment do a little to diminish the wealth of\r\nthe few: old age pensions, national insurance, and workmen's\r\ncompensation do something towards mitigating the poverty of the poor.\r\n\r\nBut it must be confessed that we have made but little progress along the\r\nmain road of Socialism. Private ownership of capital and land flourishes\r\nalmost as vigorously as it did thirty years ago. Its grosser cruelties\r\nhave been checked, but the thing itself has barely been touched. Time\r\nalone will show whether progress is to be along existing lines, whether\r\nthe power of the owners of capital over the wealth it helps to create\r\nand over the lives of the workers whom it enslaves will gradually fade\r\naway, as the power of our kings over the Government of our country has\r\nfaded, the form remaining when the substance has vanished, or whether\r\nthe community will at last consciously accept the teaching of Socialism,\r\nsetting itself definitely to put an end to large-scale private\r\ncapitalism, and undertaking itself the direct control of industry. The\r\nintellectual outlook is bright; the principles of Socialism are already\r\naccepted by a sensible proportion of the men and women in all classes\r\nwho take the trouble to think, and if we must admit that but little has\r\nyet been done, we may well believe that in the fullness of time our\r\nideas will prevail. The present war is giving the old world a great\r\nshake, and an era of precipitated reconstruction may ensue if the\r\nopportunity be wisely handled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Fabian Society on political thought is already the\r\ntheme of doctoral theses by graduates, especially in American\r\nuniversities, but it has not yet found much place in weightier\r\ncompilation. Indeed so far as I know the only serious attempts in this\r\ncountry to describe its character and estimate its proportions is to be\r\nfound in an admirable little book by Mr. Ernest Barker of New College,\r\nOxford, entitled \"Political Thought in England from Herbert Spencer to\r\nthe Present Day.\"[47] The author, dealing with the early Fabians, points\r\nout that \"Mill rather than Marx was their starting point,\" but he infers\r\nfrom this that \"they start along the line suggested by Mill with an\r\nattack on rent as the 'unearned increment' of land,\" a curious\r\ninaccuracy since our earliest contribution to the theory of Socialism,\r\nTract No. 7, \"Capital and Land,\" was expressly directed to emphasising\r\nthe comparative unimportance of Land Nationalisation, and nothing in the\r\nlater work of the Society has been inconsistent with this attitude. Then\r\nMr. Barker goes on: \"Fabianism began after 1884 to supply a new\r\nphilosophy in place of Benthamite Individualism. Of the new gospel of\r\ncollectivism a German writer[48] has said Webb was the Bentham and Shaw\r\nthe Mill.[49] Without assigning rôles we may fairly say there is some\r\nresemblance between the influence of Benthamism on legislation after\r\n1830 and the influence of Fabianism on legislation since, at any rate,\r\n1906.[50] In either case we have a small circle of thinkers and\r\ninvestigators in quiet touch with politicians: in either case we have a\r\n'permeation' of general opinion by the ideas of these thinkers and\r\ninvestigators.... It is probable that the historian of the future will\r\nemphasise Fabianism in much the same way as the historian of to-day\r\nemphasises Benthamism.\"[51]\r\n\r\nMr. Barker next explains that \"Fabianism has its own political creed, if\r\nit is a political creed consequential upon an economic doctrine. That\r\neconomic doctrine advocates the socialisation of rent. But the rents\r\nwhich the Fabians would socialise are not only rents from land. Rent in\r\nthe sense of unearned increments may be drawn, and is drawn, from other\r\nsources. The successful entrepreneur for instance draws a rent of\r\nability from his superior equipment and education. The socialisation of\r\nevery kind of rent will necessarily arm the State with great funds which\r\nit must use.... Shaw can define the two interconnected aims of Fabianism\r\nas 'the gradual extension of the franchise and the transfer of rent and\r\ninterest to the State.'\"\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Barker may not be alone in a slight misinterpretation of Fabian\r\ndoctrine it may be well to take this opportunity of refuting the error.\r\nHe says that Fabianism advocates the socialisation of rent, and in\r\nconfirmation quotes Shaw's words \"rent _and interest_\"! That makes all\r\nthe difference. If the term rent is widened to include all differential\r\nunearned incomes, from land, from ability, from opportunity (i.e.\r\nspecial profits), interest includes all non-differential unearned\r\nincomes, and thus the State is to be endowed, not with rents alone, but\r\nwith all unearned incomes.[52] It is true that the Fabians, throwing\r\nover Marx's inaccurate term \"surplus value,\" base their Socialism on the\r\nLaw of Rent, because, as they allege, this law negatives both equality\r\nof income and earnings in proportion to labour, so long as private\r\nownership of land prevails. It is also true that they have directed\r\nspecial attention to the unearned incomes of the \"idle\" landlord and\r\nshareholder, because these are the typical feature of the modern system\r\nof distribution, which indeed has come to the front since the time of\r\nMarx, and because they furnish the answer to those who contend that\r\nwealth is at present distributed approximately in accordance with\r\npersonal capacity or merit, and tacitly assume that \"the rich\" are all\r\nof them great captains of industry who by enterprise and ability have\r\nactually created their vast fortunes.[53] Indeed we might say that we do\r\nnot mind conceding to our opponents all the wealth \"created\" by superior\r\nbrains, if they will let us deal with the unearned incomes which are\r\nreceived independent of the possession of any brains, or any services at\r\nall!\r\n\r\nBut although we regard the case of the capitalist employer as relatively\r\nnegligible, and although we prefer to concentrate our attack on the\r\nleast defensible side of the capitalist system--and already the State\r\nrecognises that unearned incomes should pay a larger proportion in\r\nincome-tax, that property which passes at death, necessarily to those\r\nwho have not earned it, should contribute a large quota to the public\r\npurse, and that unearned increment on land should in part belong to the\r\npublic--that does not mean that we have any tenderness for the\r\nentrepreneur. Him we propose to deal with by the favourite Fabian method\r\nof municipalisation and nationalisation. We take over his \"enterprise,\"\r\nhis gasworks and waterworks, his docks and trams, his railways and\r\nmines. We secure for the State the profits of management and the future\r\nunearned increment, and we compensate him for his capital with\r\ninterest-bearing securities. We force him in fact to become the idle\r\nrecipient of unearned income, and then we turn round and upbraid him and\r\ntax him heavily precisely because his income is unearned! If there is\r\nany special tenderness in this treatment, I should prefer harshness. To\r\nme it seems to resemble the policy of the wolf towards the lamb.[54]\r\n\r\nI will proceed with quotations from Mr. Barker, because the view of a\r\nhistorian of thought is weightier than anything I could say.\r\n\r\n\"But collectivism also demands in the second place expert government. It\r\ndemands the 'aristocracy of talent' of which Carlyle wrote. The control\r\nof a State with powers so vast will obviously need an exceptional and\r\nexceptionally large aristocracy. Those opponents of Fabianism who desire\r\nsomething more revolutionary than its political 'meliorism' and\r\n'palliatives' accuse it of alliance with bureaucracy. They urge that it\r\nrelies on bureaucracy to administer social reforms from above; and they\r\nconclude that, since any governing _class_ is anti-democratic, the\r\nFabians who believe in such a class are really anti-democratic. The\r\ncharge seems, as a matter of fact, difficult to sustain. Fabians from\r\nthe first felt and urged that the decentralisation of the State was a\r\nnecessary condition of the realisation of their aim. The municipality\r\nand other local units were the natural bodies for administering the new\r\nfunds and discharging the new duties which the realisation of that aim\r\nwould create. 'A democratic State,' Shaw wrote, 'cannot become a Social\r\nDemocratic State unless it has in every centre of population a local\r\ngoverning body as thoroughly democratic in its constitution as the\r\ncentral Parliament.' The House of Commons he felt must develop 'into the\r\ncentral government which will be the organ of federating the\r\nmunicipalities.' Fabianism thus implied no central bureaucracy; what it\r\ndemanded was partly, indeed, a more efficient and expert central\r\ngovernment (and there is plenty of room for that), but primarily an\r\nexpert local civil service in close touch with and under the control of\r\na really democratic municipal government. It is difficult to say that\r\nthis is bureaucracy or that it is not desirable. Many men who are not\r\nFabians or Socialists of any kind feel strongly that the breathing of\r\nmore vigour and interest into local politics, and the creation of a\r\nproper local civil service, are the great problems of the future.\r\n\r\n\"The policy of Fabianism has thus been somewhat as follows. An\r\nintellectual circle has sought to permeate all classes, from the top to\r\nthe bottom, with a common opinion in favour of social control of\r\nsocially created values. Resolved to permeate all classes, it has not\r\npreached class-consciousness; it has worked as much with and through\r\nLiberal 'capitalists' as with and through Labour representatives.\r\nResolved gradually to permeate, it has not been revolutionary: it has\r\nrelied on the slow growth of opinion. Reformist rather than\r\nrevolutionary, it has explained the impossibility of the sudden\r\n'revolution' of the working classes against capital: it has urged the\r\nnecessity of a gradual amelioration of social conditions by a gradual\r\nassertion of social control over unearned increment.[55] Hence Fabianism\r\nhas not adopted the somewhat cold attitude of the pure Socialist Party\r\nto Trade Unions, but has rather found in their gradual conquest of\r\nbetter wages and better conditions for the workers the line of social\r\nadvance congenial with its own principles. Again, it has preached that\r\nthe society which is to exert control must be democratic, if the control\r\nis to be, as it must be, self-control: it has taught that such\r\ndemocratic self-control must primarily be exerted in democratic local\r\nself-government: it has emphasised the need of reconciling democratic\r\ncontrol with expert guidance. While it has never advocated 'direct\r\naction' or the avoidance of political activity, while on the contrary,\r\nit has advocated the conquest of social reforms on the fields of\r\nparliamentary and municipal government, it has not defended the State as\r\nit is, but has rather urged the need for a State which is based on\r\ndemocracy tempered by respect for the 'expert.' In this way Socialism of\r\nthe Fabian type has made representative democracy its creed. It has\r\nadopted the sound position that democracy flourishes in that form of\r\nstate in which people freely produce, thanks to an equality of\r\neducational opportunity, and freely choose, thanks to a wide and active\r\nsuffrage, their own members for their guidance, and, since they have\r\nfreely produced and chosen them, give them freely and fully the honour\r\nof their trust. And thus Socialists like Mr. Sidney Webb and Mr. Ramsay\r\nMacdonald have not coquetted with primary democracy, which has always\r\nhad a magnetic attraction for Socialists. The doctrine that the people\r\nitself governs directly through obedient agents--the doctrine of mandate\r\nand plebiscite, of referendum and initiative--is not the doctrine of\r\nthe best English Socialism.\" Mr. Barker next explains that behind these\r\nideas lies \"an organic theory of society,\" that society is regarded as\r\n\"an organic unity with a real 'general will' of its own,\" and after\r\nstating that \"the development of Liberalism, during the last few years,\r\nshows considerable traces of Fabian influence,\" concludes the subject\r\nwith the words \"Collectivism of the Fabian order was the dominant form\r\nof Socialism in England till within the last three of four years.\" Of\r\nthe movement of Guild Socialists and others which he deems to have\r\nreplaced it I shall speak later.\r\n\r\nI have ventured to quote from Mr. Barker at some length because his\r\nsummary of Fabian doctrine seems to me (with the exception noted) to be\r\nboth correct and excellent, and it is safer to borrow from a writer\r\nquite unconnected with the Society an estimate of its place in the\r\nhistory of English political thought, rather than to offer my own\r\nnecessarily prejudiced opinion of its achievements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut I must revert again to the Fabian \"method.\" \"Make Socialists,\" said\r\nMr. Wells in \"Faults of the Fabian,\" \"and you will achieve Socialism.\r\nThere is no other way\"; and Mr. Wells in his enthusiasm anticipated a\r\nsociety of ten thousand Fabians as the result of a year's propaganda.\r\nWill Socialism come through the making of Socialists?\r\n\r\nIf so, Socialism has made but little progress in England, since the\r\nnumber who profess and call themselves Socialist is still insignificant.\r\nThe foregoing pages have shown in the words of a student of political\r\nthought how Socialism has been made in England in quite another way.\r\n\r\nWe did not at the time repudiate Mr. Wells' dictum: indeed we adopted\r\nhis policy, and attempted the making of Socialism on a large scale. No\r\ndoubt there is a certain ambiguity in the word \"Socialists.\" It may mean\r\nmembers of Socialist societies, or at any rate \"unattached Socialists,\"\r\nall those in fact who use the name to describe their political opinions.\r\nOr it may merely be another way of stating that the existing form of\r\nsociety can only be altered by the wills of living people, and change\r\nwill only be in the direction of Socialism, when the wills which are\r\neffective for the purpose choose that direction in preference to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nMr. Wells himself described as a \"fantastic idea\" the notion that \"the\r\nworld may be manoeuvred into Socialism without knowing it\": that\r\n\"society is to keep like it is ... and yet Socialism will be soaking\r\nthrough it all, changing without a sign,\"[56] and he at any rate meant\r\nby his phrase, \"make members of Socialist societies.\"\r\n\r\nThe older and better Fabian doctrine is set out in the opening\r\nparagraphs of Tract 70, the \"Report on Fabian Policy\" (1896).\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE MISSION OF THE FABIANS\r\n\r\nThe object of the Fabian Society is to persuade the English people to\r\nmake their political constitution thoroughly democratic and so to\r\nsocialise their industries as to make the livelihood of the people\r\nentirely independent of private capitalism.\r\n\r\nThe Fabian Society endeavours to pursue its Socialist and Democratic\r\nobjects with complete singleness of aim. For example:--\r\n\r\nIt has no distinctive opinions on the Marriage Question, Religion, Art,\r\nabstract Economics, historic Evolution, Currency, or any other subject\r\nthan its own special business of practical Democracy and Socialism.\r\n\r\nIt brings all the pressure and persuasion in its power to bear on\r\nexisting forces, caring nothing by what name any party calls itself or\r\nwhat principles, Socialist or other, it professes, but having regard\r\nsolely to the tendency of its actions, supporting those which make for\r\nSocialism and Democracy and opposing those which are reactionary.\r\n\r\nIt does not propose that the practical steps towards Social Democracy\r\nshould be carried out by itself or by any other specially organised\r\nsociety or party.\r\n\r\nIt does not ask the English people to join the Fabian Society.\"\r\n\r\nIn old days acting on this view of our \"mission\" we deliberately allowed\r\nthe Society to remain small. Latterly we tried to expand, and in the\r\nmain our attempt was an expensive failure. The other Socialist bodies\r\nhave always used their propaganda primarily for recruiting; and they\r\nhave sought to enlist the rank and file of the British people. In this\r\nthey too have substantially failed, and the forty or fifty thousand\r\nmembers of the I.L.P. and B.S.P. are roughly no larger a proportion of\r\nthe working class than the three thousand Fabians are of the middle\r\nclass. If the advance of Socialism in England is to be measured by the\r\n\"making of Socialists,\" if we are to count membership, to enumerate\r\nmeetings, to sum up subscriptions, the outlook is gloomy. Thirty-four\r\nyears ago a group of strong men led by Mr. H.M. Hyndman founded the\r\nDemocratic Federation, which survives as the British Socialist Party,\r\nwith Mr. Hyndman still to the fore; the rest have more or less dropped\r\nout, and no one has arisen to take their places. Twenty-two years ago\r\nKeir Hardie founded the Independent Labour Party: he has died since the\r\nfirst draft of this passage was written, and no one is left who commands\r\nsuch universal affection and respect amongst the members of the Society\r\nhe created. Of the seven Essayists who virtually founded the Fabian\r\nSociety only one is still fully in harness, and his working life must\r\nnecessarily be nearing its term. It may be doubted whether a society for\r\nthe propagation of ideas has the power to long outlive the inspiration\r\nof its founder, unless indeed he is a man of such outstanding\r\npersonality that his followers treat him as a god. The religions of the\r\nworld have been maintained by worshippers, and even in our own day the\r\nfollowers of Marx have held together partly because they regard his\r\nteachings with the uncritical reverence usually accorded to the prophets\r\nof new faiths. But Marxism has survived in Germany chiefly because it\r\nhas created and inspired a political party, and political parties are of\r\na different order from propagandist societies. Socialism in England has\r\nnot yet created a political party; for the Labour Party, though entirely\r\nSocialist in policy, is not so in name or in creed, and in this matter\r\nthe form counts rather than the fact.\r\n\r\nEurope, as I write in the early days of 1916, is in the melting-pot, and\r\nit would be foolish to prophesy either the fate of the nations now at\r\nwar or, in particular, the future of political parties in Great Britain,\r\nand especially of the Labour Party.\r\n\r\nBut so far as concerns the Fabian Society and the two other Socialist\r\nSocieties, this much may be said: three factors in the past have kept\r\nthem apart: differences of temperament; differences of policy;\r\ndifferences of leadership. In fact perhaps the last was the strongest.\r\n\r\nI do not mean that the founders of the three societies entertained\r\nmutual antipathies or personal jealousies to the detriment of the\r\nmovement. I do mean that each group preferred to go its own way, and saw\r\nno sufficient advantage in a common path to compensate for the\r\ndifficulties of selecting it.\r\n\r\nIn a former chapter I have explained how a movement for a form of\r\nSocialist Unity had at last almost achieved success, when a new factor,\r\nthe European War, interposed. After the war these negotiations will\r\ndoubtless be resumed, and the three Socialist Societies will find\r\nthemselves more closely allied than ever before. The differences of\r\npolicy which have divided them will then be a matter of past history.\r\nThe differences of temperament matter less and less as the general\r\npolicy becomes fixed, and in a few years the old leaders from whose\r\ndisputes the general policy emerged must all have left the stage. The\r\nyounger men inherit an established platform and know nothing of the\r\nold-time quarrels and distrusts. They will come together more easily. If\r\nthe organised propaganda of Socialism continues--and that perhaps is not\r\na matter of certainty--it seems to me improbable that it will be carried\r\non for long by three separate societies. In some way or other, in\r\nEngland as in so many other countries, a United Socialist organisation\r\nwill be constituted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut what of the future of Fabian ideas? In a passage already quoted Mr.\r\nBarker indicates that the dominance of \"Collectivism of the Fabian\r\norder\" ceased three or four years ago, and he goes on to indicate that\r\nit has been replaced by an anti-state propaganda, taking various forms,\r\nSyndicalism, Guild Socialism, and the Distributivism of Mr. Belloc. It\r\nis true that Fabianism of the old type is not the last event in the\r\nhistory of political thought, but it is still, I venture to think, the\r\ndominant principle in political progress. Guild Socialism, whatever its\r\nworth, is a later stage. If our railways are to be managed by the\r\nRailwaymen's Union, they must first be acquired for the community by\r\nCollectivism.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to discuss the possibilities of Guild Socialism.\r\nAfter all it is but a form of Socialism, and a first principle of\r\nFabianism has always been free thought. The leading Guild Socialists\r\nresigned from the Society: they were not expelled: they attempted to\r\ncoerce the rest, but no attempt was made to coerce them. Guild Socialism\r\nas a scheme for placing production under the management of the producers\r\nseems to me to be on the wrong lines. The consumer as a citizen must\r\nnecessarily decide what is to be produced for his needs. But I do not\r\nbelong to the generation which will have to settle the matter. The\r\nelderly are incompetent judges of new ideas. Fabian doctrine is not\r\nstereotyped: the Society consists in the main of young people. The\r\nEssayists and their contemporaries have said their say: it remains for\r\nthe younger people to accept what they choose, and to add whatever is\r\nnecessary. Those who repudiated the infallibility of Marx will be the\r\nlast to claim infallibility for themselves. I can only express the hope\r\nthat as long as the Fabian Society lasts it will be ever open to new\r\nideas, ever conscious that nothing is final, ever aware that the world\r\nis enormously complex, and that no single formula will summarise or\r\ncircumscribe its infinite variety.[57]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe work of the Fabian Society has been not to make Socialists, but to\r\nmake Socialism. I think it may be said that the dominant opinion in the\r\nSociety--at any rate it is my opinion--is that great social changes can\r\nonly come by consent. The Capitalist system cannot be overthrown by a\r\nrevolution or by a parliamentary majority. Wage slavery will disappear,\r\nas serfdom disappeared, not indeed imperceptibly, for the world is now\r\nself-conscious, not even so gradually, for the pace of progress is\r\nfaster than it was in the Middle Ages, but by a change of heart of the\r\ncommunity, by a general recognition, already half realised, that\r\nwhatever makes for the more equitable distribution of wealth is good;\r\nthat whatever benefits the working class benefits the nation; that the\r\nrich exist only on sufferance, and deserve no more than painless\r\nextinction; that the capitalist is a servant of the public, and too\r\noften over-paid for the services that he renders.\r\n\r\nAgain, Socialism succeeds because it is common sense. The anarchy of\r\nindividual production is already an anachronism. The control of the\r\ncommunity over itself extends every day. We demand order, method,\r\nregularity, design; the accidents of sickness and misfortune, of old age\r\nand bereavement, must be prevented if possible, and if not, mitigated.\r\nOf this principle the public is already convinced: it is merely a\r\nquestion of working out the details. But order and forethought is wanted\r\nfor industry as well as for human life. Competition is bad, and in most\r\nrespects private monopoly is worse. No one now seriously defends the\r\nsystem of rival traders with their crowds of commercial travellers: of\r\nrival tradesmen with their innumerable deliveries in each street; and\r\nyet no one advocates the capitalist alternative, the great trust, often\r\nconcealed and insidious, which monopolises oil or tobacco or diamonds,\r\nand makes huge profits for a fortunate; few out of the helplessness of\r\nthe unorganised consumers.\r\n\r\nBut neither the idle rich class nor the anarchy of competition is so\r\noutstanding an evil as the poverty of the poor. We aim at making the\r\nrich poorer chiefly in order to make the poor richer. Our first tract,\r\n\"Why are the Many Poor?\" struck the keynote. In a century of abounding\r\nwealth England still has in its midst a hideous mass of poverty which is\r\ntoo appalling to think of. That poverty, we say, is preventible. That\r\npoverty was the background of our thoughts when the Society was founded.\r\nPerhaps we have done a little to mitigate it: we believe we have done\r\nsomething to make clear the way by which it may ultimately be abolished.\r\nWe do not constantly talk of it. We write of the advantages of Municipal\r\nElectricity, of the powers of Parish Councils, of the objections to the\r\nReferendum; but all the while it is that great evil which chiefly moves\r\nus, and by our success or our failure in helping on the reconstruction\r\nof society for the purpose of abolishing poverty, the work of the Fabian\r\nSociety must ultimately be judged.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[43] \"La Société Fabienne et le Mouvement socialiste anglais\r\ncontemporain.\" By Édouard Pfeiffer, Paris, F.

For various reasons I prefer to leave that chapter as it\r\nstands; but the memoranda have an interest of their own and I therefore\r\nprint them here.\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nON THE HISTORY OF FABIAN ECONOMICS\r\n\r\nMr. Barker's guesses greatly underrate the number of tributaries which\r\nenlarged the trickle of Socialist thought into a mighty river. They also\r\nshew how quickly waves of thought are forgotten. Far from being the\r\neconomic apostle of Socialism, Mill, in the days when the Fabian Society\r\ntook the field, was regarded as the standard authority for solving the\r\nsocial problem by a combination of peasant proprietorship with\r\nneo-Malthusianism. The Dialectical Society, which was a centre of the\r\nmost advanced thought in London until the Fabian Society supplanted it,\r\nwas founded to advocate the principles of Mill's Essay on Liberty, which\r\nwas much more the Bible of English Individualism than Das Kapital ever\r\nwas of English Socialism. As late as 1888 Henry Sidgwick, a follower of\r\nMill, rose indignantly at the meeting of the British Association in\r\nBath, to which I had just read the paper on The Transition to\r\nSocial-Democracy, which was subsequently published; as one of the\r\nFabian Essays, and declared that I had advocated nationalisation of\r\nland; that nationalisation of land was a crime; and that he would not\r\ntake part in a discussion of a criminal proposal. With that he left the\r\nplatform, all the more impressively as his apparently mild and judicial\r\ntemperament made the incident so unexpected that his friends who had not\r\nactually witnessed it were with difficulty persuaded that it had really\r\nhappened. It illustrates the entire failure of Mill up to that date to\r\nundo the individualistic teaching of the earlier volumes of his\r\nPolitical Economy by the Socialist conclusions to which his work on the\r\ntreatise led him at the end. Sidney Webb astonished and confounded our\r\nIndividualist opponents by citing Mill against them; and it is probably\r\ndue to Webb more than to any other disciple that it is now generally\r\nknown that Mill died a Socialist. Webb read Mill and mastered Mill as he\r\nseemed to have read and mastered everybody else; but the only other\r\nprominent Socialist who can be claimed by Mill as a convert was, rather\r\nunexpectedly, William Morris, who said that when he read the passage in\r\nwhich Mill, after admitting that the worst evils of Communism are,\r\ncompared to the evils of our Commercialism, as dust in the balance,\r\nnevertheless condemned Communism, he immediately became a Communist, as\r\nMill had clearly given his verdict against the evidence. Except in these\r\ninstances we heard nothing of Mill in the Fabian Society. Cairnes's\r\ndenunciation of the idle consumers of rent and interest was frequently\r\nquoted; and Marshall's Economics of Industry was put into our book boxes\r\nas a textbook; but the taste for abstract economics was no more general\r\nin the Fabian Society than elsewhere. I had in my boyhood read some of\r\nMill's detached essays, including those on constitutional government\r\nand on the Irish land question, as well as the inevitable one on\r\nLiberty; but none of these pointed to Socialism; and my attention was\r\nfirst drawn to political economy as the science of social salvation by\r\nHenry George's eloquence, and by his Progress and Poverty, which had an\r\nenormous circulation in the early eighties, and beyond all question had\r\nmore to do with the Socialist revival of that period in England than any\r\nother book. Before the Fabian Society existed I pressed George's\r\npropaganda of Land Nationalisation on a meeting of the Democratic\r\nFederation, but was told to read Karl Marx. I was so complete a novice\r\nin economics at that time that when I wrote a letter to Justice pointing\r\nout a flaw in Marx's reasoning, I regarded my letter merely as a joke,\r\nand fully expected that some more expert Socialist economist would\r\nrefute me easily. Even when the refutation did not arrive I remained so\r\nimpressed with the literary power and overwhelming documentation of\r\nMarx's indictment of nineteenth-century Commercialism and the capitalist\r\nsystem, that I defended him against all comers in and out of season\r\nuntil Philip Wicksteed, the well-known Dante commentator, then a popular\r\nUnitarian minister, brought me to a standstill by a criticism of Marx\r\nwhich I did not understand. This was the first appearance in Socialist\r\ncontroversy of the value theory of Jevons, published in 1871. Professor\r\nEdgeworth and Mr. Wicksteed, to whom Jevons appealed as a mathematician,\r\nwere at that time trying to convince the academic world of the\r\nimportance of Jevons's theory; but I, not being a mathematician, was not\r\neasily accessible to their methods of demonstration. I consented to\r\nreply to Mr. Wicksteed on the express condition that the editor of\r\nTo-day, in which my reply appeared, should find space for a rejoinder\r\nby Mr. Wicksteed. My reply, which was not bad for a fake, and contained\r\nthe germ of the economic argument for equality of income which I put\r\nforward twenty-five years later, elicited only a brief rejoinder; but\r\nthe upshot was that I put myself into Mr. Wicksteed's hands and became a\r\nconvinced Jevonian, fascinated by the subtlety of Jevons's theory and\r\nthe exquisiteness with which it adapted itself to all the cases which\r\nhad driven previous economists, including Marx, to take refuge in clumsy\r\ndistinctions between use value, exchange value, labour value, supply and\r\ndemand value, and the rest of the muddlements of that time.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the abstract economics of the Fabian Essays are, as regards\r\nvalue, the economics of Jevons. As regards rent they are the economics\r\nof Ricardo, which I, having thrown myself into the study of abstract\r\neconomics, had learnt from Ricardo's own works and from De Quincey's\r\nLogic of Political Economy. I maintained, as I still do, that the older\r\neconomists, writing before Socialism had arisen as a possible\r\nalternative to Commercialism and a menace to its vested interests, were\r\nfar more candid in their statements and thorough in their reasoning than\r\ntheir successors, and was fond of citing the references in De Quincey\r\nand Austin's Lectures on Jurisprudence to the country gentleman system\r\nand the evils of capitalism, as instances of frankness upon which no\r\nmodern professor dare venture.\r\n\r\nThe economical and moral identity of capital and interest with land and\r\nrent was popularly demonstrated by Olivier in Tract 7 on Capital and\r\nLand, and put into strict academic form by Sidney Webb. The point was of\r\nimportance at a time when the distinction was still so strongly\r\nmaintained that the Fabian Society was compelled to exclude Land\r\nNationalizers, both before and after their development into Single\r\nTaxers, because they held that though land and rent should be\r\nsocialized, capital and interest must remain private property.\r\n\r\nThis really exhausts the history of the Fabian Society as far as\r\nabstract economic theory is concerned. Activity in that department was\r\nconfined to Webb and myself. Later on, Pease's interest in banking and\r\ncurrency led him to contribute some criticism of the schemes of the\r\ncurrency cranks who infest all advanced movements, flourishing the paper\r\nmoney of the Guernsey Market, and to give the Society some positive\r\nguidance as to the rapid integration of modern banking. But this was an\r\nessay in applied economics. It may be impossible to draw a line between\r\nthe old abstract deductive economics and the modern historical concrete\r\neconomics; but the fact remains that though the water may be the same,\r\nthe tide has turned. A comparison of my exposition of the law of rent in\r\nmy first Fabian Essay and in my Impossibilities of Anarchism with the\r\nWebbs' great Histories of Trade Unionism and of Industrial Democracy\r\nwill illustrate the difference between the two schools.\r\n\r\nThe departure was made by Graham Wallas, who, abandoning the deductive\r\nconstruction of intellectual theorems, made an exhaustive study of the\r\nChartist movement. It is greatly to be regretted that these lectures\r\nwere not effectively published. Their delivery wrought a tremendous\r\ndisillusion as to the novelty of our ideas and methods of propaganda;\r\nmuch new gospel suddenly appeared to us as stale failure; and we\r\nrecognized that there had been weak men before Agamemnon, even as far\r\nback as in Cromwell's army. The necessity for mastering the history of\r\nour own movement and falling into our ordered place in it became\r\napparent; and it was in this new frame of mind that the monumental\r\nseries of works by the Webbs came into existence. Wallas's Life of\r\nFrancis Place shows his power of reconstructing a popular agitation with\r\na realism which leaves the conventional imaginary version of it\r\npunctured and flaccid; and it was by doing the same for the Chartist\r\nmovement that he left his mark on us.\r\n\r\nOf the other Essayists, Olivier had wrestled with the huge Positive\r\nPhilosophy of Comte, who thus comes in as a Fabian influence. William\r\nClarke was a disciple of Mazzini, and found Emerson, Thoreau, and the\r\nBrook Farm enthusiasts congenial to him. Bland, who at last became a\r\nprofessed Catholic, was something of a Coleridgian transcendentalist,\r\nthough he treated a copy of Bakunin's God and the State to a handsome\r\nbinding. Mrs. Besant's spiritual history has been written by herself.\r\nWallas brought to bear a wide scholastic culture of the classic type, in\r\nwhich modern writers, though interesting, were not fundamental. The\r\ngeneral effect, it will be perceived, is very much wider and more\r\nvarious than that suggested by Mr. Ernest Barker's remark that Mill was\r\nour starting point.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that of the three great propagandist amateurs of\r\npolitical economy, Henry George, Marx, and Ruskin, Ruskin alone seems to\r\nhave had no effect on the Fabians. Here and there in the Socialist\r\nmovement workmen turned up who had read Fors Clavigera or Unto This\r\nLast; and some of the more well-to-do no doubt had read the first\r\nchapter of Munera Pulveris. But Ruskin's name was hardly mentioned in\r\nthe Fabian Society. My explanation is that, barring Olivier, the Fabians\r\nwere inveterate Philistines. My efforts to induce them to publish\r\nRichard Wagner's Art and Revolution, and, later on, Oscar Wilde's The\r\nSoul of Man under Socialism, or even to do justice to Morris's News From\r\nNowhere, fell so flat that I doubt whether my colleagues were even\r\nconscious of them. Our best excuse must be that as a matter of practical\r\nexperience English political societies do good work and present a\r\ndignified appearance whilst they attend seriously to their proper\r\npolitical business; but, to put it bluntly, they make themselves\r\nridiculous and attract undesirables when they affect art and philosophy.\r\nThe Arts and Crafts exhibitions, the Anti-Scrape (Society for the\r\nProtection of Ancient Buildings), and the Art Workers' Guild, under\r\nMorris and Crane, kept up a very intimate connection between Art and\r\nSocialism; but the maintenance of Fabian friendly relations with them\r\nwas left mostly to me and Stewart Headlam. The rest kept aloof and\r\nconsoled themselves with the reflection--if they thought about it at\r\nall--that the Utilitarians, though even more Philistine than the\r\nFabians, were astonishingly effective for their numbers.\r\n\r\nIt must be added that though the tradition that Socialism excludes the\r\nestablished creeds was overthrown by the Fabians, and the claim of the\r\nChristian Socialists to rank with the best of us was insisted on\r\nfaithfully by them, the Fabian leaders did not break the tradition in\r\ntheir own practice. The contention of the Anti-Socialist Union that all\r\nSocialists are atheists is no doubt ridiculous in the face of the fact\r\nthat the intellectual opposition to Socialism has been led exclusively\r\nby avowed atheists like Charles Bradlaugh or agnostics like Herbert\r\nSpencer, whilst Communism claims Jesus as an exponent; still, if the\r\nquestion be raised as to whether any of the Fabian Essayists attended an\r\nestablished place of worship regularly, the reply must be in the\r\nnegative. Indeed, they were generally preaching themselves on Sundays.\r\nTo describe them as irreligious in view of their work would be silly;\r\nbut until Hubert Bland towards the end of his life took refuge in the\r\nCatholic Church, and Mrs. Besant devoted herself to Theosophy, no\r\nleading Fabian found a refuge for his soul in the temples of any\r\nestablished denomination. I may go further and admit that the first\r\nproblems the Fabians had to solve were so completely on the materialist\r\nplane that the atmosphere inevitably became uncongenial to those whose\r\ncapacity was wasted and whose sympathies were starved on that plane.\r\nEven psychical research, with which Pease and Podmore varied their\r\nFabian activities, tended fatally towards the exposure of alleged\r\npsychical phenomena as physical tricks. The work that came to our hands\r\nin our first two decades was materialistic work; and it was not until\r\nthe turn of the century brought us the Suffrage movement and the Wells\r\nraid, that the materialistic atmosphere gave way, and the Society began\r\nto retain recruits of a kind that it always lost in the earlier years as\r\nit lost Mrs. Besant and (virtually) William Clarke. It is certainly\r\nperceptibly less hard-headed than it was in its first period.\r\n\r\n\r\nB\r\n\r\nON GUILD SOCIALISM\r\n\r\nHere I venture to say, with some confidence, that Mr. Barker is\r\nmistaken. That storm has burst on the Fabian Society and has left it\r\njust where it was. Guild Socialism, championed by the ablest and most\r\nindustrious insurgents of the rising generation in the Society, raised\r\nits issue with Collectivism only to discover, when the matter, after a\r\nlong agitation, was finally thrashed out at a conference at Barrow\r\nHouse, that the issue was an imaginary one, and that Collectivism lost\r\nnothing by the fullest tenable concessions to the Guild Socialists. A\r\nvery brief consideration will shew that this was inevitable.\r\n\r\nGuild Socialism, in spite of its engaging medieval name, means nothing\r\nmore picturesque than a claim that under Socialism each industry shall\r\nbe controlled by its own operators, as the professions are to-day. This\r\nby itself would not imply Socialism at all: it would be merely a revival\r\nof the medieval guild, or a fresh attempt at the now exploded\r\nself-governing workshop of the primitive co-operators. Guild Socialism,\r\nwith the emphasis on the Socialism, implies that the industries, however\r\ncompletely they may be controlled by their separate staffs, must pool\r\ntheir products. All the Guild Socialists admit this. The Socialist State\r\nmust therefore include an organ for receiving and distributing the\r\npooled products; and such an organ, representing the citizen not as\r\nproducer but as consumer, reintroduces the whole machinery of\r\nCollectivism. Thus the alleged antithesis between Guild Socialism and\r\nCollectivism, under cover of which the one was presented as an\r\nalternative to the other, vanished at the first touch of the skilled\r\ncriticism the Fabians brought to bear on it; and now Mrs. Sidney Webb,\r\nwho was singled out for attack by the Guild Socialists as the arch\r\nCollectivist, is herself conducting an investigation into the existing\r\ncontrol of industry by professional organizations, whilst the quondam\r\nGuild Socialists are struggling with the difficult question of the\r\nproper spheres of the old form of Trade Union now called the craft\r\nunion, and the new form called the industrial union, in which workers of\r\nall crafts and occupations, from clerks and railway porters to\r\nlocomotive drivers and fitters, are organized in a single union of the\r\nentire industry. There is work enough for many years to some of the old\r\nFabian kind in these directions; and this work will irresistibly reunite\r\nthe disputants instead of perpetuating a quarrel in which, like most of\r\nthe quarrels which the Society has survived, there was nothing\r\nfundamental at issue.\r\n\r\nThere is work, too, to be done in the old abstract deductive department.\r\nIt can be seen, throughout the history of the Society, how any attempt\r\nto discard the old economic basis of the law of rent immediately\r\nproduced a recrudescence of Anarchism in one form or another, the latest\r\nbeing Syndicalism and that form of Guild Socialism which was all Guild\r\nand no Socialism. But there is still much to be settled by the deductive\r\nmethod. The fundamental question of the proportions in which the\r\nnational income, when socialized, shall be distributed, was not grappled\r\nwith until 1914, when I, lecturing on behalf of the Society, delivered\r\nmy final conclusion that equal distribution is the only solution that\r\nwill realize the ideals of Socialism, and that it is in fact the\r\neconomic goal of Socialism. This is not fully accepted as yet in the\r\nmovement, in which there is still a strong leaven of the old craving for\r\nan easy-going system which, beginning with \"the socialization of the\r\nmeans of production, distribution, and exchange,\" will then work out\r\nautomatically without interference with the citizen's private affairs.\r\n\r\nAnother subject which has hardly yet been touched, and which also must\r\nbegin with deductive treatment, is what may be called the\r\ndemocratization of democracy, and its extension from a mere negative and\r\nvery uncertain check on tyranny to a positive organizing force. No\r\nexperienced Fabian believes that society can be reconstructed (or rather\r\nconstructed; for the difficulty is that society is as yet only half\r\nrescued from chaos) by men of the type produced by popular election\r\nunder existing circumstances, or indeed under any circumstances likely\r\nto be achieved before the reconstruction. The fact that a hawker cannot\r\nply his trade without a licence whilst a man may sit in Parliament\r\nwithout any relevant qualifications is a typical and significant anomaly\r\nwhich will certainly not be removed by allowing everybody to be a hawker\r\nat will. Sooner or later, unless democracy is to be discarded in a\r\nreaction of disgust such as killed it in ancient Athens, democracy\r\nitself will demand that only such men should be presented to its choice\r\nas have proved themselves qualified for more serious and disinterested\r\nwork than \"stoking up\" election meetings to momentary and foolish\r\nexcitement. Without qualified rulers a Socialist State is impossible;\r\nand it must not be forgotten (though the reminder is as old as Plato)\r\nthat the qualified men may be very reluctant men instead of very\r\nambitious ones.\r\n\r\nHere, then, are two very large jobs already in sight to occupy future\r\nFabians. Whether they will call themselves Fabians and begin by joining\r\nthe Fabian Society is a question which will not be settled by the\r\ngeneration to which I belong.\r\n\r\nG.B.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix II\r\n\r\nThe Basis of the Fabian Society\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fabian Society consists of Socialists.\r\n\r\nIt therefore aims at the reorganisation of Society by the emancipation\r\nof Land and Industrial Capital from individual and class ownership, and\r\nthe vesting of them in the community for the general benefit. In this\r\nway only can the natural and acquired advantages of the country be\r\nequitably shared by the whole people.\r\n\r\nThe Society accordingly works for the extinction of private property in\r\nLand and of the consequent individual appropriation, in the form of\r\nRent, of the price paid for permission to use the earth, as well as for\r\nthe advantages of superior soils and sites.\r\n\r\nThe Society, further, works for the transfer to the community of the\r\nadministration of such industrial Capital as can conveniently be managed\r\nsocially. For, owing to the monopoly of the means of production in the\r\npast, industrial inventions and the transformation of surplus income\r\ninto Capital have mainly enriched the proprietary class, the worker\r\nbeing now dependent on that class for leave to earn a living.\r\n\r\nIf these measures be carried out, without compensation (though not\r\nwithout such relief to expropriated individuals as may seem fit to the\r\ncommunity), Rent and Interest will be added to the reward of labour, the\r\nidle class now living on the labour of others will necessarily\r\ndisappear, and practical equality of opportunity will be maintained by\r\nthe spontaneous action of economic forces with much less interference\r\nwith personal liberty than the present system entails.\r\n\r\nFor the attainment of these ends the Fabian Society looks to the spread\r\nof Socialist opinions, and the social and political changes consequent\r\nthereon, _including the establishment of equal citizenship for men and\r\nwomen._[58] It seeks to achieve these ends by the general dissemination\r\nof knowledge as to the relation between the individual and Society in\r\nits economic, ethical, and political aspects.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[58] The words in italics were added in 1907.
