By the reiteration of such\r\nunappropriate terms as \"rebellion\" and \"treason,\" and the asseveration\r\nthat the South was levying war against the United States, those ignorant\r\nof the nature of the Union, and of the reserved powers of the States,\r\nhave been led to believe that the Confederate States were in the\r\ncondition of revolted provinces, and that the United States were forced\r\nto resort to arms for the preservation of their existence. To those who\r\nknew that the Union was formed for specific enumerated purposes, and\r\nthat the States had never surrendered their sovereignty it was a\r\npalpable absurdity to apply to them, or to their citizens when obeying\r\ntheir mandates, the terms \"rebellion\" and \"treason\"; and, further, it is\r\nshown in the following pages that the Confederate States, so far from\r\nmaking war or seeking to destroy the United States, as soon as they had\r\nan official organ, strove earnestly, by peaceful recognition, to\r\nequitably adjust all questions growing out of the separation from their\r\nlate associates.\r\n\r\nAnother great perversion of truth has been the arraignment of the men\r\nwho participated in the formation of the Confederacy and who bore arms\r\nin its defense, as the instigators of a controversy leading to disunion.\r\nSectional issues appear conspicuously in the debates of the Convention\r\nwhich framed the Federal Constitution, and its many compromises were\r\ndesigned to secure an equilibrium between the sections, and to preserve\r\nthe interests as well as the liberties of the several States. African\r\nservitude at that time was not confined to a section, but was\r\nnumerically greater in the South than in the North, with a tendency to\r\nits continuance in the former and cessation in the latter. It therefore\r\nthus early presents itself as a disturbing element, and the provisions\r\nof the Constitution, which were known to be necessary for its adoption,\r\nbound all the States to recognize and protect that species of property.\r\nWhen at a subsequent period there arose in the Northern States an\r\nantislavery agitation, it was a harmless and scarcely noticed movement\r\nuntil political demagogues seized upon it as a means to acquire power.\r\nHad it been left to pseudo-philanthropists and fanatics, most zealous\r\nwhere least informed, it never could have shaken the foundations of the\r\nUnion and have incited one section to carry fire and sword into the\r\nother. That the agitation was political in its character, and was\r\nclearly developed as early as 1803, it is believed has been established\r\nin these pages. To preserve a sectional equilibrium and to maintain the\r\nequality of the States was the effort on one side, to acquire empire was\r\nthe manifest purpose on the other. This struggle began before the men of\r\nthe Confederacy were born; how it arose and how it progressed it has\r\nbeen attempted briefly to show. Its last stage was on the question of\r\nterritorial governments; and, if in this work it has not been\r\ndemonstrated that the position of the South was justified by the\r\nConstitution and the equal rights of the people of all the States, it\r\nmust be because the author has failed to present the subject with a\r\nsufficient degree of force and clearness.\r\n\r\nIn describing the events of the war, space has not permitted, and the\r\nloss of both books and papers has prevented, the notice of very many\r\nentitled to consideration, as well for the humanity as the gallantry of\r\nour men in the unequal combats they fought. These numerous omissions, it\r\nis satisfactory to know, the official reports made at the time and the\r\nsubsequent contributions which have been and are being published by the\r\nactors, will supply more fully and graphically than could have been done\r\nin this work.\r\n\r\nUsurpations of the Federal Government have been presented, not in a\r\nspirit of hostility, but as a warning to the people against the dangers\r\nby which their liberties are beset. When the war ceased, the pretext on\r\nwhich it had been waged could no longer be alleged. The emancipation\r\nproclamation of Mr. Lincoln, which, when it was issued, he humorously\r\nadmitted to be a nullity, had acquired validity by the action of the\r\nhighest authority known to our institutions--the people assembled in\r\ntheir several State Conventions. The soldiers of the Confederacy had\r\nlaid down their arms, had in good faith pledged themselves to abstain\r\nfrom further hostile operations, and had peacefully dispersed to their\r\nhomes; there could not, then, have been further dread of them by the\r\nGovernment of the United States. The plea of necessity could, therefore,\r\nno longer exist for hostile demonstration against the people and States\r\nof the deceased Confederacy. Did vengeance, which stops at the grave,\r\nsubside? Did real peace and the restoration of the States to their\r\nformer rights and positions follow, as was promised on the restoration\r\nof the Union? Let the recital of the invasion of the reserved powers of\r\nthe States, or the people, and the perversion of the republican form of\r\ngovernment guaranteed to each State by the Constitution, answer the\r\nquestion. For the deplorable fact of the war, for the cruel manner in\r\nwhich it was waged, for the sad physical and yet sadder moral results it\r\nproduced, the reader of these pages, I hope, will admit that the South,\r\nin the forum of conscience, stands fully acquitted.\r\n\r\nMuch of the past is irremediable; the best hope for a restoration in the\r\nfuture to the pristine purity and fraternity of the Union, rests on the\r\nopinions and character of the men who are to succeed this generation:\r\nthat they maybe suited to that blessed work, one, whose public course is\r\nended, invokes them to draw their creed from the fountains of our\r\npolitical history, rather than from the lower stream, polluted as it has\r\nbeen by self-seeking place-hunters and by sectional strife.\r\n\r\nTHE

For this purpose I have decided\r\nto present an historical sketch of the events which preceded and\r\nattended the struggle of the Southern States to maintain their existence\r\nand their rights as sovereign communities--the creators, not the\r\ncreatures, of the General Government.\r\n\r\nThe social problem of maintaining the just relation between\r\nconstitution, government, and people, has been found so difficult, that\r\nhuman history is a record of unsuccessful efforts to establish it. A\r\ngovernment, to afford the needful protection and exercise proper care\r\nfor the welfare of a people, must have homogeneity in its constituents.\r\nIt is this necessity which has divided the human race into separate\r\nnations, and finally has defeated the grandest efforts which conquerors\r\nhave made to give unlimited extent to their domain. When our fathers\r\ndissolved their connection with Great Britain, by declaring themselves\r\nfree and independent States, they constituted thirteen separate\r\ncommunities, and were careful to assert and preserve, each for itself,\r\nits sovereignty and jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nAt a time when the minds of men are straying far from the lessons our\r\nfathers taught, it seems proper and well to recur to the original\r\nprinciples on which the system of government they devised was founded.\r\nThe eternal truths which they announced, the rights which they declared\r\n\"_unalienable_,\" are the foundation-stones on which rests the\r\nvindication of the Confederate cause.\r\n\r\nHe must have been a careless reader of our political history who has not\r\nobserved that, whether under the style of \"United Colonies\" or \"United\r\nStates,\" which was adopted after the Declaration of Independence,\r\nwhether under the articles of Confederation or the compact of Union,\r\nthere everywhere appears the distinct assertion of State sovereignty,\r\nand nowhere the slightest suggestion of any purpose on the part of the\r\nStates to consolidate themselves into one body. Will any candid,\r\nwell-informed man assert that, at any time between 1776 and 1790, a\r\nproposition to surrender the sovereignty of the States and merge them in\r\na central government would have had the least possible chance of\r\nadoption? Can any historical fact be more demonstrable than that the\r\nStates did, both in the Confederation and in the Union, retain their\r\nsovereignty and independence as distinct communities, voluntarily\r\nconsenting to federation, but never becoming the fractional parts of a\r\nnation? That such opinions should find adherents in our day, may be\r\nattributable to the natural law of aggregation; surely not to a\r\nconscientious regard for the terms of the compact for union by the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIn all free governments the constitution or organic law is supreme over\r\nthe government, and in our Federal Union this was most distinctly marked\r\nby limitations and prohibitions against all which was beyond the\r\nexpressed grants of power to the General Government. In the foreground,\r\ntherefore, I take the position that those who resisted violations of the\r\ncompact were the true friends, and those who maintained the usurpation\r\nof undelegated powers were the real enemies of the constitutional Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n    African Servitude.--A Retrospect.--Early Legislation with Regard\r\n    to the Slave-Trade.--The Southern States foremost in prohibiting\r\n    it.--A Common Error corrected.--The Ethical Question never at\r\n    Issue in Sectional Controversies.--The Acquisition of\r\n    Louisiana.--The Missouri Compromise.--The Balance of\r\n    Power.--Note.--The Indiana Case.\r\n\r\n\r\nInasmuch as questions growing out of the institution of negro servitude,\r\nor connected with it, will occupy a conspicuous place in what is to\r\nfollow, it is important that the reader should have, in the very outset,\r\na right understanding of the true nature and character of those\r\nquestions. No subject has been more generally misunderstood or more\r\npersistently misrepresented. The institution itself has ceased to exist\r\nin the United States; the generation, comprising all who took part in\r\nthe controversies to which it gave rise, or for which it afforded a\r\npretext, is passing away; and the misconceptions which have prevailed in\r\nour own country, and still more among foreigners remote from the field\r\nof contention, are likely to be perpetuated in the mind of posterity,\r\nunless corrected before they become crystallized by tacit acquiescence.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that, at the time of the adoption of the Federal\r\nConstitution, African servitude existed in all the States that were\r\nparties to that compact, unless with the single exception of\r\nMassachusetts, in which it had, perhaps, very recently ceased to exist.\r\nThe slaves, however, were numerous in the Southern, and very few in the\r\nNorthern, States. This diversity was occasioned by differences of\r\nclimate, soil, and industrial interests--not in any degree by moral\r\nconsiderations, which at that period were not recognized, as an element\r\nin the question. It was simply because negro labor was more profitable\r\nin the South than in the North that the importation of negro slaves had\r\nbeen, and continued to be, chiefly directed to the Southern ports.[1]\r\nFor the same reason slavery was abolished by the States of the Northern\r\nsection (though it existed in several of them for more than fifty years\r\nafter the adoption of the Constitution), while the importation of slaves\r\ninto the South continued to be carried on by Northern merchants and\r\nNorthern ships, without interference in the traffic from any quarter,\r\nuntil it was prohibited by the spontaneous action of the Southern States\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution expressly forbade any interference by Congress with the\r\nslave-trade--or, to use its own language, with the \"migration or\r\nimportation of such persons\" as any of the States should think proper to\r\nadmit--\"prior to the year 1808.\" During the intervening period of more\r\nthan twenty years, the matter was exclusively under the control of the\r\nrespective States. Nevertheless, every Southern State, without\r\nexception, either had already enacted, or proceeded to enact, laws\r\nforbidding the importation of slaves.[2] Virginia was the first of all\r\nthe States, North or South, to prohibit it, and Georgia was the first to\r\nincorporate such a prohibition in her organic Constitution.\r\n\r\nTwo petitions for the abolition of slavery and the slave-trade were\r\npresented February 11 and 12, 1790, to the very first Congress convened\r\nunder the Constitution.[3] After full discussion in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, it was determined, with regard to the first-mentioned\r\nsubject, \"that Congress have no authority to interfere in the\r\nemancipation of slaves, or in the treatment of them within any of the\r\nStates\"; and, with regard to the other, that no authority existed to\r\nprohibit the migration or importation of such persons as the States\r\nmight think proper to admit--\"prior to the year 1808.\" So distinct and\r\nfinal was this statement of the limitations of the authority of Congress\r\nconsidered to be that, when a similar petition was presented two or\r\nthree years afterward, the Clerk of the House was instructed to return\r\nit to the petitioner.[4]\r\n\r\nIn 1807, Congress, availing itself of the very earliest moment at which\r\nthe constitutional restriction ceased to be operative, passed an act\r\nprohibiting the importation of slaves into any part of the United States\r\nfrom and after the first day of January, 1808. This act was passed with\r\ngreat unanimity. In the House of Representatives there were one hundred\r\nand thirteen (113) yeas to five (5) nays; and it is a significant fact,\r\nas showing the absence of any sectional division of sentiment at that\r\nperiod, that the five dissentients were divided as equally as possible\r\nbetween the two sections: two of them were from Northern and three from\r\nSouthern States.[5]\r\n\r\nThe slave-trade had thus been finally abolished some months before the\r\nbirth of the author of these pages, and has never since had legal\r\nexistence in any of the United States. The question of the maintenance\r\nor extinction of the system of negro servitude, already existing in any\r\nState, was one exclusively belonging to such State. It is obvious,\r\ntherefore, that no subsequent question, legitimately arising in Federal\r\nlegislation, could properly have any reference to the merits or the\r\npolicy of the institution itself. A few zealots in the North afterward\r\ncreated much agitation by demands for the abolition of slavery within\r\nthe States by Federal intervention, and by their activity and\r\nperseverance finally became a recognized party, which, holding the\r\nbalance of power between the two contending organizations in that\r\nsection, gradually obtained the control of one, and to no small degree\r\ncorrupted the other. The dominant idea, however, at least of the\r\nabsorbed party, was sectional aggrandizement, looking to absolute\r\ncontrol, and theirs is the responsibility for the war that resulted.\r\n\r\nNo moral nor sentimental considerations were really involved in either\r\nthe earlier or later controversies which so long agitated and finally\r\nruptured the Union. They were simply struggles between different\r\nsections, with diverse institutions and interests.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely requisite, in order to a right understanding of the\r\nhistory of the country, to bear these truths clearly in mind. The\r\nphraseology of the period referred to will otherwise be essentially\r\ndeceptive. The antithetical employment of such terms as _freedom_ and\r\n_slavery_, or \"anti-slavery\" and \"pro-slavery,\" with reference to the\r\nprinciples and purposes of contending parties or rival sections, has had\r\nimmense influence in misleading the opinions and sympathies of the\r\nworld. The idea of freedom is captivating, that of slavery repellent to\r\nthe moral sense of mankind in general. It is easy, therefore, to\r\nunderstand the effect of applying the one set of terms to one party, the\r\nother to another, in a contest which had no just application whatever to\r\nthe essential merits of freedom or slavery. Southern statesmen may\r\nperhaps have been too indifferent to this consideration--in their ardent\r\npursuit of principles, overlooking the effects of phrases.\r\n\r\nThis is especially true with regard to that familiar but most fallacious\r\nexpression, \"the extension of slavery.\" To the reader unfamiliar with\r\nthe subject, or viewing it only on the surface, it would perhaps never\r\noccur that, as used in the great controversies respecting the\r\nTerritories of the United States, it does not, never did, and never\r\ncould, imply the addition of a single slave to the number already\r\nexisting. The question was merely whether the slaveholder should be\r\npermitted to go, with his slaves, into territory (the common property of\r\nall) into which the non-slaveholder could go with _his_ property of any\r\nsort. There was no proposal nor desire on the part of the Southern\r\nStates to reopen the slave-trade, which they had been foremost in\r\nsuppressing, or to add to the number of slaves. It was a question of the\r\ndistribution, or dispersion, of the slaves, rather than of the\r\n\"extension of slavery.\" Removal is not extension. Indeed, if\r\nemancipation was the end to be desired, the dispersion of the negroes\r\nover a wider area among additional Territories, eventually to become\r\nStates, and in climates unfavorable to slave-labor, instead of\r\nhindering, would have promoted this object by diminishing the\r\ndifficulties in the way of ultimate emancipation.\r\n\r\nThe distinction here defined between the distribution, or dispersion, of\r\nslaves and the extension of slavery--two things altogether different,\r\nalthough so generally confounded--was early and clearly drawn under\r\ncircumstances and in a connection which justify a fuller notice.\r\n\r\nVirginia, it is well known, in the year 1784, ceded to the United\r\nStates--then united only by the original Articles of Confederation--her\r\nvast possessions northwest of the Ohio, from which the great States of\r\nOhio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, and part of Minnesota,\r\nhave since been formed. In 1787--before the adoption of the Federal\r\nConstitution--the celebrated \"Ordinance\" for the government of this\r\nNorthwestern Territory was adopted by the Congress, with the full\r\nconsent, and indeed at the express instance, of Virginia. This Ordinance\r\nincluded six definite \"Articles of compact between the original States\r\nand the people and States in the said Territory,\" which were to \"for\r\never remain unalterable unless by common consent.\" The sixth of these\r\narticles ordains that \"there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary\r\nservitude in the said Territory, otherwise than in the punishment of\r\ncrimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.\"\r\n\r\nIn December, 1805, a petition of the Legislative Council and House of\r\nRepresentatives of the Indiana Territory--then comprising all the area\r\nnow occupied by the States of Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and\r\nWisconsin--was presented to Congress. It appears from the proceedings of\r\nthe House of Representatives that several petitions of the same purport\r\nfrom inhabitants of the Territory, accompanied by a letter from William\r\nHenry Harrison, the Governor (afterward President of the United States),\r\nhad been under consideration nearly two years earlier. The prayer of\r\nthese petitions was for a _suspension_ of the sixth article of the\r\nOrdinance, so as to permit the introduction of slaves into the\r\nTerritory. The whole subject was referred to a select committee of seven\r\nmembers, consisting of representatives from Virginia, Ohio,\r\nPennsylvania, South Carolina, Kentucky, and New York, and the delegate\r\nfrom the Indiana Territory.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of the ensuing February (1806), this committee made a report\r\nfavorable to the prayer of the petitioners, and recommending a\r\nsuspension of the prohibitory article for ten years. In their report the\r\ncommittee, after stating their opinion that a qualified suspension of\r\nthe article in question would be beneficial to the people of the Indiana\r\nTerritory, proceeded to say:\r\n\r\n    \"The suspension of this article is an object almost universally\r\n    desired in that Territory. It appears to your committee to be a\r\n    question entirely different from that between slavery and\r\n    freedom, inasmuch as it would merely occasion the removal of\r\n    persons, already slaves, from one part of the country to\r\n    another. The good effects of this suspension, in the present\r\n    instance, would be to accelerate the population of that\r\n    Territory, hitherto retarded by the operation of that article of\r\n    compact; as slaveholders emigrating into the Western country\r\n    might then indulge any preference which they might feel for a\r\n    settlement in the Indiana Territory, instead of seeking, as they\r\n    are now compelled to do, settlements in other States or\r\n    countries permitting the introduction of slaves. The condition\r\n    of the slaves themselves would be much ameliorated by it, as it\r\n    is evident, from experience, that the more they are separated\r\n    and diffused the more care and attention are bestowed on them by\r\n    their masters, each proprietor having it in his power to\r\n    increase their comforts and conveniences in proportion to the\r\n    smallness of their numbers.\"\r\n\r\nThese were the dispassionate utterances of representatives of every part\r\nof the Union--men contemporary with the origin of the Constitution,\r\nspeaking before any sectional division had arisen in connection with the\r\nsubject. It is remarkable that the very same opinions which they express\r\nand arguments which they adduce had, fifty years afterward, come to be\r\ndenounced and repudiated by one half of the Union as partisan and\r\nsectional when propounded by the other half.\r\n\r\nNo final action seems to have been taken on the subject before the\r\nadjournment of Congress, but it was brought forward at the next session\r\nin a more imposing form. On the 20th of January, 1807, the Speaker laid\r\nbefore the House of Representatives a letter from Governor Harrison,\r\ninclosing certain resolutions formally and _unanimously_ adopted by the\r\nLegislative Council and House of Representatives of the Indiana\r\nTerritory, in favor of the suspension of the sixth article of the\r\nOrdinance and the introduction of slaves into the Territory, which they\r\nsay would \"meet the approbation of at least nine tenths of the good\r\ncitizens of the same.\" Among the resolutions were the following:\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved unanimously_, That the abstract question of liberty\r\n    and slavery is not considered as involved in a suspension of the\r\n    said article, inasmuch as the number of slaves in the United\r\n    States _would not be augmented_ by this measure.\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved unanimously_, That the suspension of the said article\r\n    would be equally advantageous to the Territory, to the States\r\n    from whence the negroes would be brought, and to the negroes\r\n    themselves....\r\n\r\n    \"The States which are overburdened with negroes would be\r\n    benefited by their citizens having an opportunity of disposing\r\n    of the negroes which they can not comfortably support, or of\r\n    removing with them to a country abounding with all the\r\n    necessaries of life; and the negro himself would exchange a\r\n    scanty pittance of the coarsest food for a plentiful and\r\n    nourishing diet, and a situation which admits not the most\r\n    distant prospect of emancipation for one which presents no\r\n    considerable obstacle to his wishes.\"\r\n\r\nThese resolutions were submitted to a committee drawn, like the former,\r\nfrom different sections of the country, which again reported favorably,\r\nreiterating in substance the reasons given by the former committee.\r\nTheir report was sustained by the House, and a resolution to suspend the\r\nprohibitory article was adopted. The proposition failed, however, in the\r\nSenate, and there the matter seems to have been dropped. The proceedings\r\nconstitute a significant and instructive episode in the political\r\nhistory of the country.\r\n\r\nThe allusion which has been made to the Ordinance of 1787, renders it\r\nproper to notice, very briefly, the argument put forward during the\r\ndiscussion of the Missouri question, and often repeated since, that the\r\nOrdinance afforded a precedent in support of the claim of a power in\r\nCongress to determine the question of the admission of slaves into the\r\nTerritories, and in justification of the prohibitory clause applied in\r\n1820 to a portion of the Louisiana Territory.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the Congress of the Confederation and that of the\r\nFederal Constitution is so broad that the action of the former can, in\r\nno just sense, be taken as a precedent for the latter. The Congress of\r\nthe Confederation represented the States in their sovereignty, each\r\ndelegation having one vote, so that all the States were of equal weight\r\nin the decision of any question. It had legislative, executive, and in\r\nsome degree judicial powers, thus combining all departments of\r\ngovernment in itself. During its recess a committee known as the\r\nCommittee of the States exercised the powers of the Congress, which was\r\nin spirit, if not in fact, an assemblage of the States.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Congress of the Constitution is only the\r\nlegislative department of the General Government, with powers strictly\r\ndefined and expressly limited to those delegated by the States. It is\r\nfurther held in check by an executive and a judiciary, and consists of\r\ntwo branches, each having peculiar and specified functions.\r\n\r\nIf, then, it be admitted--which is at least very questionable--that the\r\nCongress of the Confederation had rightfully the power to exclude slave\r\nproperty from the territory northwest of the Ohio River, that power must\r\nhave been derived from its character as an assemblage of the sovereign\r\nStates; not from the Articles of Confederation, in which no indication\r\nof the grant of authority to exercise such a function can be found. The\r\nCongress of the Constitution is expressly prohibited from the assumption\r\nof any power not distinctly and specifically delegated to it as the\r\nlegislative branch of an organized government. What was questionable in\r\nthe former case, therefore, becomes clearly inadmissible in the latter.\r\n\r\nBut there is yet another material distinction to be observed. The\r\nStates, owners of what was called the Northwestern Territory, were\r\ncomponent members of the Congress which adopted the Ordinance for its\r\ngovernment, and gave thereto their full and free consent. The Ordinance\r\nmay, therefore, be regarded as virtually a treaty between the States\r\nwhich ceded and those which received that extensive domain. In the other\r\ncase, Missouri and the whole region affected by the Missouri Compromise,\r\nwere parts of the territory acquired from France under the name of\r\nLouisiana; and, as it requires two parties to make or amend a treaty,\r\nFrance and the Government of the United States should have coöperated in\r\nany amendment of the treaty by which Louisiana had been acquired, and\r\nwhich guaranteed to the inhabitants of the ceded territory \"all the\r\nrights, advantages, and immunities of citizens of the United States,\"\r\nand \"the free enjoyment of their liberty, property, and the religion\r\nthey profess.\"--(\"State Papers,\" vol. ii, \"Foreign Relations,\" p. 507.)\r\n\r\nFor all the reasons thus stated, it seems to me conclusive that the\r\naction of the Congress of the Confederation in 1787 could not constitute\r\na precedent to justify the action of the Congress of the United States\r\nin 1820, and that the prohibitory clause of the Missouri Compromise was\r\nwithout constitutional authority, in violation of the rights of a part\r\nof the joint owners of the territory, and in disregard of the\r\nobligations of the treaty with France.\r\n\r\nThe basis of sectional controversy was the question of the balance of\r\npolitical power. In its earlier manifestations this was undisguised. The\r\npurchase of the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803, and the\r\nsubsequent admission of a portion of that Territory into the Union as a\r\nState, afforded one of the earliest occasions for the manifestation of\r\nsectional jealousy, and gave rise to the first threats, or warnings\r\n(which proceeded from New England), of a dissolution of the Union. Yet,\r\nalthough negro slavery existed in Louisiana, no pretext was made of that\r\nas an objection to the acquisition. The ground of opposition is frankly\r\nstated in a letter of that period from one Massachusetts statesman to\r\nanother--\"that the influence of _our_ part of the Union must be\r\ndiminished by the acquisition of more weight at the other extremity.\"[6]\r\n\r\nSome years afterward (in 1819-'20) occurred the memorable contest with\r\nregard to the admission into the Union of Missouri, the second State\r\ncarved out of the Louisiana Territory. The controversy arose out of a\r\nproposition to attach to the admission of the new State a proviso\r\nprohibiting slavery or involuntary servitude therein. The vehement\r\ndiscussion that ensued was continued into the first session of a\r\ndifferent Congress from that in which it originated, and agitated the\r\nwhole country during the interval between the two. It was the first\r\nquestion that ever seriously threatened the stability of the Union, and\r\nthe first in which the sentiment of opposition to slavery in the\r\nabstract was introduced as an adjunct of sectional controversy. It was\r\nclearly shown in debate that such considerations were altogether\r\nirrelevant; that the number of existing slaves would not be affected by\r\ntheir removal from the older States to Missouri; and, moreover, that the\r\nproposed restriction would be contrary to the spirit, if not to the\r\nletter, of the Constitution.[7] Notwithstanding all this, the\r\nrestriction was adopted, by a vote almost strictly sectional, in the\r\nHouse of Representatives. It failed in the Senate through the firm\r\nresistance of the Southern, aided by a few patriotic and conservative\r\nNorthern, members of that body. The admission of the new State, without\r\nany restriction, was finally accomplished by the addition to the bill of\r\na section for ever prohibiting slavery in all that portion of the\r\nLouisiana Territory lying north of thirty-six degrees and thirty\r\nminutes, north latitude, except Missouri--by implication leaving the\r\nportion south of that line open to settlement either with or without\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nThis provision, as an offset to the admission of the new State without\r\nrestriction, constituted the celebrated Missouri Compromise. It was\r\nreluctantly accepted by a small majority of the Southern members. Nearly\r\nhalf of them voted against it, under the conviction that it was\r\nunauthorized by the Constitution, and that Missouri was entitled to\r\ndetermine the question for herself, as a matter of right, not of bargain\r\nor concession. Among those who thus thought and voted were some of the\r\nwisest statesmen and purest patriots of that period.[8]\r\n\r\nThis brief retrospect may have sufficed to show that the question of the\r\nright or wrong of the institution of slavery was in no wise involved in\r\nthe earlier sectional controversies. Nor was it otherwise in those of a\r\nlater period, in which it was the lot of the author of these memoirs to\r\nbear a part. They were essentially struggles for sectional equality or\r\nascendancy--for the maintenance or the destruction of that balance of\r\npower or equipoise between North and South, which was early recognized\r\nas a cardinal principle in our Federal system. It does not follow that\r\nboth parties to this contest were wholly right or wholly wrong in their\r\nclaims. The determination of the question of right or wrong must be left\r\nto the candid inquirer after examination of the evidence. The object of\r\nthese preliminary investigations has been to clear the subject of the\r\nobscurity produced by irrelevant issues and the glamour of ethical\r\nillusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It will be remembered that, during her colonial condition,\r\nVirginia made strenuous efforts to prevent the importation of Africans,\r\nand was overruled by the Crown; also, that Georgia, under Oglethorpe,\r\ndid prohibit the introduction of African slaves until 1752, when the\r\nproprietors surrendered the charter, and the colony became a part of the\r\nroyal government, and enjoyed the same privileges as the other\r\ncolonies.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: South Carolina subsequently (in 1803) repealed her law\r\nforbidding the importation of slaves. The reason assigned for this\r\naction was the impossibility of enforcing the law without the aid of the\r\nFederal Government, to which entire control of the revenues, revenue\r\npolice, and naval forces of the country had been surrendered by the\r\nStates. \"The geographical situation of our country,\" said Mr. Lowndes,\r\nof South Carolina, in the House of Representatives on February 14, 1804,\r\n\"is not unknown. With navigable rivers running into the heart of it, it\r\nwas impossible, with our means, to prevent our Eastern brethren ...\r\nengaged in this trade, from introducing them [the negroes] into the\r\ncountry. The law was completely evaded.... Under these circumstances,\r\nsir, it appears to me to have been the duty of the Legislature to repeal\r\nthe law, and remove from the eyes of the people the spectacle of its\r\nauthority being daily violated.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of the repeal was to permit the importation of negroes into\r\nSouth Carolina during the interval from 1803 to 1808. It in probable\r\nthat an extensive _contraband_ trade was carried on by the New England\r\nslavers with other ports, on account of the lack of means to enforce the\r\nlaws of the Southern States forbidding it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: One from the Society of Friends assembled at Philadelphia\r\nand New York, the other from the Pennsylvania society of various\r\nreligious denominations combined for the abolition of slavery.\r\n\r\nFor report of the debate, see Benton's \"Abridgment,\" vol. i, pp.\r\n201-207, _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See Benton's \"Abridgment,\" vol. i, p. 397.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: One was from New Hampshire, one from Vermont, two from\r\nVirginia, and one from South Carolina.--(Benton's \"Abridgment,\" vol.\r\niii, p. 519.)\r\n\r\nNo division on the final vote in the Senate.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Cabot to Pickering, who was then Senator from\r\nMassachusetts.--(See \"Life and Letters of George Cabot,\" by H.

Foot,\r\na representative from Connecticut, in an incidental reference to it in\r\ndebate on another subject, a few weeks after the final settlement of the\r\nMissouri case. He said: \"The Missouri question did not involve the\r\nquestion of freedom or slavery, but merely _whether slaves now in the\r\ncountry might be permitted to reside in the proposed new State; and\r\nwhether Congress or Missouri possessed the power to decide_.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The votes on the proposed _restriction_, which eventually\r\nfailed of adoption, and on the _compromise_, which was finally adopted,\r\nare often confounded. The advocacy of the former measure was exclusively\r\nsectional, no Southern member voting for it in either House. On the\r\nadoption of the compromise line of thirty-six degrees and thirty\r\nminutes, the vote in the Senate was 34 yeas to 10 nays. The Senate\r\nconsisted of forty-four members from twenty-two States, equally divided\r\nbetween the two sections--Delaware being classed as a Southern State.\r\nAmong the yeas were all the Northern votes, except two from\r\nIndiana--being 20--and 14 Southern. The nays consisted of 2 from the\r\nNorth, and 8 from the South.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, the vote was 134 yeas to 42 nays. Of\r\nthe yeas, 95 were Northern, 39 Southern; of the nays, 5 Northern, and 37\r\nSouthern.\r\n\r\nAmong the nays in the Senate were Messrs. James Barbour and James\r\nPleasants, of Virginia; Nathaniel Macon, of North Carolina; John\r\nGaillard and William Smith, of South Carolina. In the House, Philip P.\r\nBarbour, John Randolph, John Tyler, and William S. Archer, of Virginia;\r\nCharles Pinckney, of South Carolina (one of the authors of the\r\nConstitution); Thomas W.

The recent acquisition from Mexico of New Mexico and\r\nCalifornia required legislation by Congress. In the Senate the bills\r\nreported by the Committee on Territories were referred to a select\r\ncommittee, of which Mr. Clay, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky,\r\nwas chairman. From this committee emanated the bills which, taken\r\ntogether, are known as the compromise measures of 1850.\r\n\r\nWith some others, I advocated the division of the newly acquired\r\nterritory by an extension to the Pacific Ocean of the Missouri\r\nCompromise line of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes north latitude.\r\nThis was not because of any inherent merit or fitness in that line, but\r\nbecause it had been accepted by the country as a settlement of the\r\nsectional question which, thirty years before, had threatened a rupture\r\nof the Union, and it had acquired in the public mind a prescriptive\r\nrespect which it seemed unwise to disregard. A majority, however,\r\ndecided otherwise, and the line of political conciliation was then\r\nobliterated, as far as it lay in the power of Congress to do so. An\r\nanalysis of the vote will show that this result was effected almost\r\nexclusively by the representatives of the North, and that the South was\r\nnot responsible for an action which proved to be the opening of\r\nPandora's box.[9]\r\n\r\nHowever objectionable it may have been in 1820 to adopt that political\r\nline as expressing a geographical definition of different sectional\r\ninterests, and however it may be condemned as the assumption by Congress\r\nof a function not delegated to it, it is to be remembered that the act\r\nhad received such recognition and _quasi_-ratification by the people of\r\nthe States as to give it a value which it did not originally possess.\r\nPacification had been the fruit borne by the tree, and it should not\r\nhave been recklessly hewed down and cast into the fire. The frequent\r\nassertion then made was that all discrimination was unjust, and that the\r\npopular will should be left untrammeled in the formation of new States.\r\nThis theory was good enough in itself, and as an abstract proposition\r\ncould not be gainsaid; but its practical operation has but poorly\r\nsustained the expectations of its advocates, as will be seen when we\r\ncome to consider the events that occurred a few years later in Kansas\r\nand elsewhere. Retrospectively viewed under the mellowing light of time,\r\nand with the calm consideration we can usually give to the irremediable\r\npast, the compromise legislation of 1850 bears the impress of that\r\nsectional spirit so widely at variance with the general purposes of the\r\nUnion, and so destructive of the harmony and mutual benefit which the\r\nConstitution was intended to secure.\r\n\r\nThe refusal to divide the territory acquired from Mexico by an extension\r\nof the line of the Missouri Compromise to the Pacific was a consequence\r\nof the purpose to admit California as a State of the Union before it had\r\nacquired the requisite population, and while it was mainly under the\r\ncontrol of a military organization sent from New York during the war\r\nwith Mexico and disbanded in California upon the restoration of peace.\r\nThe inconsistency of the argument against the extension of the line was\r\nexhibited in the division of the Territory of Texas by that parallel,\r\nand payment to the State of money to secure her consent to the partition\r\nof her domain. In the case of Texas, the North had everything to gain\r\nand nothing to lose by the application of the practice of geographical\r\ncompromise on an arbitrary line. In the case of California, the\r\nconditions were reversed; the South might have been the gainer and the\r\nNorth the loser by a recognition of the same rule.\r\n\r\nThe compensation which it was alleged that the South received was a more\r\neffective law for the rendition of fugitives from service or labor. But\r\nit is to be remarked that this law provided for the execution by the\r\nGeneral Government of obligations which had been imposed by the Federal\r\ncompact upon the several States of the Union. The benefit to be derived\r\nfrom a fulfillment of that law would be small in comparison with the\r\nevil to result from the plausible pretext that the States had thus been\r\nrelieved from a duty which they had assumed in the adoption of the\r\ncompact of union. Whatever tended to lead the people of any of the\r\nStates to feel that they could be relieved from their constitutional\r\nobligations by transferring them to the General Government, or that they\r\nmight thus or otherwise evade or resist them, could not fail to be like\r\nthe tares which the enemy sowed amid the wheat. The union of States,\r\nformed to secure the permanent welfare of posterity and to promote\r\nharmony among the constituent States, could not, without changing its\r\ncharacter, survive such alienation as rendered its parts hostile to the\r\nsecurity, prosperity, and happiness of one another.\r\n\r\nIt was reasonably argued that, as the Legislatures of fourteen of the\r\nStates had enacted what were termed \"personal liberty laws,\" which\r\nforbade the coöperation of State officials in the rendition of fugitives\r\nfrom service and labor, it became necessary that the General Government\r\nshould provide the requisite machinery for the execution of the law. The\r\nresult proved what might have been anticipated--that those communities\r\nwhich had repudiated their constitutional obligations, which had\r\nnullified a previous law of Congress for the execution of a provision of\r\nthe Constitution, and had murdered men who came peacefully to recover\r\ntheir property, would evade or obstruct, so as to render practically\r\nworthless, _any_ law that could be enacted for that purpose. In the\r\nexceptional cases in which it might be executed, the event would be\r\nattended with such conflict between the State and Federal authorities as\r\nto produce consequent evils greater than those it was intended to\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nIt was during the progress of these memorable controversies that the\r\nSouth lost its most trusted leader, and the Senate its greatest and\r\npurest statesman. He was taken from us--\r\n\r\n  \"Like a summer-dried fountain,\r\n  When our need was the sorest;\"--\r\n\r\nwhen his intellectual power, his administrative talent, his love of\r\npeace, and his devotion to the Constitution, might have averted\r\ncollision; or, failing in that, he might have been to the South the\r\nPalinurus to steer the bark in safety over the perilous sea. Truly did\r\nMr. Webster--his personal friend, although his greatest political\r\nrival--say of him in his obituary address, \"There was nothing groveling,\r\nor low, or meanly selfish, that came near the head or the heart of Mr.\r\nCalhoun.\" His prophetic warnings speak from the grave with the wisdom of\r\ninspiration. Would that they could have been appreciated by his\r\ncountrymen while he yet lived!\r\n\r\n    Note.--While the compromise measures of 1850 were pending, and\r\n    the excitement concerning them was at its highest, I one day\r\n    overtook Mr. Clay, of Kentucky, and Mr. Berrien, of Georgia, in\r\n    the Capitol grounds. They were in earnest conversation. It was\r\n    the 7th of March--the day on which Mr. Webster had delivered his\r\n    great speech. Mr. Clay, addressing me in the friendly manner\r\n    which he had always employed since I was a schoolboy in\r\n    Lexington, asked me what I thought of the speech. I liked it\r\n    better than he did. He then suggested that I should \"join the\r\n    compromise men,\" saying that it was a measure which he thought\r\n    would probably give peace to the country for thirty years--the\r\n    period that had elapsed since the adoption of the compromise of\r\n    1820. Then, turning to Mr. Berrien, he said, \"You and I will be\r\n    under ground before that time, but our young friend here may\r\n    have trouble to meet.\" I somewhat impatiently declared my\r\n    unwillingness to transfer to posterity a trial which they would\r\n    be relatively less able to meet than we were, and passed on my\r\n    way.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The vote in the Senate on the proposition to continue the\r\nline of the Missouri Compromise through the newly acquired territory to\r\nthe Pacific was twenty-four yeas, to thirty-two nays. Reckoning Delaware\r\nand Missouri as Southern States, the vote of the two sections was\r\nexactly equal. The yeas were _all_ cast by Southern Senators; the nays\r\nwere all Northern, except two from Delaware, one from Missouri, and one\r\nfrom Kentucky.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n    Reëlection to the Senate.--Political Controversies in\r\n    Mississippi.--Action of the Democratic State Convention.--Defeat\r\n    of the State-Rights Party.--Withdrawal of General Quitman and\r\n    Nomination of the Author as Candidate for the Office of\r\n    Governor.--The Canvass and its Result.--Retirement to Private\r\n    Life.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had been reëlected by the Legislature of Mississippi as my own\r\nsuccessor, and entered upon a new term of service in the Senate on March\r\n4, 1851.\r\n\r\nOn my return to Mississippi in 1851, the subject chiefly agitating the\r\npublic mind was that of the \"compromise\" measures of the previous year.\r\nConsequent upon these was a proposition for a convention of delegates,\r\nfrom the people of the Southern States respectively, to consider what\r\nsteps ought to be taken for their future peace and safety, and the\r\npreservation of their constitutional rights. There was diversity of\r\nopinion with regard to the merits of the measures referred to, but the\r\ndisagreement no longer followed the usual lines of party division. They\r\nwho saw in those measures the forerunner of disaster to the South had no\r\nsettled policy beyond a convention, the object of which should be to\r\ndevise new and more effectual guarantees against the perils of\r\nusurpation. They were unjustly charged with a desire to destroy the\r\nUnion--a feeling entertained by few, very few, if by any, in\r\nMississippi, and avowed by none.\r\n\r\nThere were many, however, who held that the principles of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and the purposes for which the Union was\r\nformed, were of higher value than the mere Union itself. Independence\r\nexisted before the compact of union between the States; and, if that\r\ncompact should be broken in part, and therefore destroyed in whole, it\r\nwas hoped that the liberties of the people in the States might still be\r\npreserved. Those who were most devoted to the Union of the Constitution\r\nmight, consequently, be expected to resist most sternly any usurpation\r\nof undelegated power, the effect of which would be to warp the Federal\r\nGovernment from its proper character, and, by sapping the foundation, to\r\ndestroy the Union of the States.\r\n\r\nMy recent reëlection to the United States Senate had conferred upon me\r\nfor six years longer the office which I preferred to all others. I could\r\nnot, therefore, be suspected of desiring a nomination for any other\r\noffice from the Democratic Convention, the meeting of which was then\r\ndrawing near. Having, as a Senator of the State, freely participated in\r\ndebate on the measures which were now exciting so much interest in the\r\npublic mind, it was very proper that I should visit the people in\r\ndifferent parts of the State and render an account of my stewardship.\r\n\r\nMy devotion to the Union of our fathers had been so often and so\r\npublicly declared; I had, on the floor of the Senate, so defiantly\r\nchallenged any question of my fidelity to it; my services, civil and\r\nmilitary, had now extended through so long a period, and were so\r\ngenerally known--that I felt quite assured that no whisperings of envy\r\nor ill will could lead the people of Mississippi to believe that I had\r\ndishonored their trust by using the power they had conferred on me to\r\ndestroy the Government to which I was accredited. Then, as afterward, I\r\nregarded the separation of the States as a great, though not the\r\ngreatest, evil.\r\n\r\nI returned from my tour among the people at the time appointed for the\r\nmeeting of the nominating convention of the Democratic (or State-Rights)\r\nparty. During the previous year the Governor, General John A. Quitman,\r\nhad been compelled to resign his office to answer an indictment against\r\nhim for complicity with the \"filibustering\" expeditions against Cuba.\r\nThe charges were not sustained; many of the Democratic party of\r\nMississippi, myself included, recognized a consequent obligation to\r\nrenominate him for the office of which he had been deprived. When,\r\nhowever, the delegates met in party convention, the committee appointed\r\nto select candidates, on comparison of opinions, concluded that, in view\r\nof the effort to fix upon the party the imputation of a purpose of\r\ndisunion, some of the antecedents of General Quitman might endanger\r\nsuccess. A proposition was therefore made, in the committee on\r\nnominations, that I should be invited to become a candidate, and that,\r\nif General Quitman would withdraw, my acceptance of the nomination and\r\nthe resignation of my place in the United States Senate, which it was\r\nknown would result, was to be followed by the appointment by the\r\nGovernor of General Quitman to the vacated place in the Senate. I\r\noffered no objection to this arrangement, but left it to General Quitman\r\nto decide. He claimed the nomination for the governorship, or nothing,\r\nand was so nominated.\r\n\r\nTo promote the success of the Democratic nominees, I engaged actively in\r\nthe canvass, and continued in the field until stricken down by disease.\r\nThis occurred just before the election of delegates to a State\r\nConvention, for which provision had been made by the Legislature, and\r\nthe canvass for which, conducted in the main upon party lines, was in\r\nprogress simultaneously with that for the ordinary State officers. The\r\nDemocratic majority in the State when the canvass began was estimated at\r\neight thousand. At this election, in September, for delegates to the\r\nState Convention, we were beaten by about seven thousand five hundred\r\nvotes. Seeing in this result the foreshadowing of almost inevitable\r\ndefeat, General Quitman withdrew from the canvass as a candidate, and\r\nthe Executive Committee of the party (empowered to fill vacancies)\r\ncalled on me to take his place. My health did not permit me to leave\r\nhome at that time, and only about six weeks remained before the election\r\nwas to take place; but, being assured that I was not expected to take\r\nany active part, and that the party asked only the use of my name, I\r\nconsented to be announced, and immediately resigned from the United\r\nStates Senate. Nevertheless, I soon afterward took the field in person,\r\nand worked earnestly until the day of election. I was defeated, but the\r\nmajority of more than seven thousand votes, that had been cast a short\r\ntime before against the party with which I was associated, was reduced\r\nto less than one thousand.[10]\r\n\r\nIn this canvass, both before and after I became a candidate, no argument\r\nor appeal of mine was directed against the perpetuation of the Union.\r\nBelieving, however, that the signs of the time portended danger to the\r\nSouth from the usurpation by the General Government of undelegated\r\npowers, I counseled that Mississippi should enter into the proposed\r\nmeeting of the people of the Southern States, to consider what could and\r\nshould be done to insure our future safety, frankly stating my\r\nconviction that, unless such action were taken then, sectional rivalry\r\nwould engender greater evils in the future, and that, if the controversy\r\nwas postponed, \"the last opportunity for a peaceful solution would be\r\nlost, then the issue would have to be settled by blood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The following letter, written in 1853 to the Hon. William\r\nJ. Brown, of Indiana, formerly a member of Congress from that State, and\r\nsubsequently published, relates to the events of this period, and\r\naffords nearly contemporaneous evidence in confirmation of the\r\nstatements of the text:\r\n\r\n\"Washington D.C., _May 7, 1853_.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Sir: I received the 'Sentinel' containing your defense of me\r\nagainst the fate accusation of disunionism, and, before I had returned\r\nto you the thanks to which you are entitled, I received this day the St.\r\nJoseph 'Valley Register,' marked by you, to call my attention to an\r\narticle in answer to your defense, which was just in all things, save\r\nyour too complimentary terms.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I had the letter quoted from, that you might publish the whole\r\nof that which is garbled to answer a purpose. In a part of the letter\r\nnot published, I put such a damper on the attempt to fix on me the\r\ndesire to break up our Union, and presented other points in a form so\r\nlittle acceptable to the unfriendly inquirers, that the publication of\r\nthe letter had to be drawn out of them.\r\n\r\n\"At the risk of being wearisome, but encouraged by your marked\r\nfriendship, I will give you a statement in the case. The meeting of\r\nOctober, 1849, was a convention of delegates equally representing the\r\nWhig and Democratic parties in Mississippi. The resolutions were\r\ndecisive as to equality of right in the South with the North to the\r\nTerritories acquired from Mexico, and proposed a convention of the\r\nSouthern States. I was not a member, but on invitation addressed the\r\nConvention. The succeeding Legislature instructed me, as a Senator, to\r\nassert this equality, and, under the existing circumstances, to resist\r\nby all constitutional means the admission of California as a State. At a\r\ncalled session of the Legislature in 1850, a self-constituted committee\r\ncalled on me, by letter, for my views. They were men who had enacted or\r\napproved the resolutions of the Convention of 1849, and instructed me,\r\nas members of the Legislature, in regular session, in the early part of\r\nthe year 1850. To them I replied that I adhered to the policy they had\r\nindicated and instructed me in their official character to pursue.\r\n\r\n\"I pointed out the mode in which their policy could, in my opinion, be\r\nexecuted without bloodshed or disastrous convulsion, but in terms of\r\nbitter scorn alluded to such as would insult me with a desire to destroy\r\nthe Union, for which my whole life proved me to be a devotee.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon the egotism, in consideration of the occasion, when I say to you\r\nthat my father and my uncles fought through the Revolution of 1776,\r\ngiving their youth, their blood, and their little patrimony to the\r\nconstitutional freedom which I claim as my inheritance. Three of my\r\nbrothers fought in the war of 1812. Two of them were comrades of the\r\nHero of the Hermitage, and received his commendation for gallantry at\r\nNew Orleans. At sixteen years of age I was given to the service of my\r\ncountry; for twelve years of my life I have borne its arms and served\r\nit, zealously, if not well. As I feel the infirmities, which suffering\r\nmore than age has brought upon me, it would be a bitter reflection,\r\nindeed, if I was forced to conclude that my countrymen would hold all\r\nthis light when weighed against the empty panegyric which a time-serving\r\npolitician can bestow upon the Union, for which he never made a\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\n\"In the Senate I announced that, if any respectable man would call me a\r\ndisunionist, I would answer him in monosyllables.... But I have often\r\nasserted the right, for which the battles of the Revolution were\r\nfought--the right of a people to change their government whenever it was\r\nfound to be oppressive, and subversive of the objects for which\r\ngovernments are instituted--and have contended for the independence and\r\nsovereignty of the States, a part of the creed of which Jefferson was\r\nthe apostle, Madison the expounder, and Jackson the consistent defender.\r\n\r\n\"I have written freely, and more than I designed. Accept my thanks for\r\nyour friendly advocacy. Present me in terms of kind remembrance to your\r\nfamily, and believe me, very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n\"Jefferson Davis.\r\n\r\n\"Note.--No party in Mississippi ever advocated disunion. They differed\r\nas to the mode of securing their rights in the Union, and on the power\r\nof a State to secede--neither advocating the exercise of the power.\r\n\r\n\"J.D.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    The Author enters the Cabinet.--Administration of the War\r\n    Department.--Surveys for a Pacific Railway.--Extension of the\r\n    Capitol.--New Regiments organized.--Colonel Samuel Cooper,\r\n    Adjutant-General.--A Bit of Civil-Service Reform.--Reëlection to\r\n    the Senate.--Continuity of the Pierce Cabinet.--Character of\r\n    Franklin Pierce.\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy in the peaceful pursuits of a planter; busily engaged in cares for\r\nservants, in the improvement of my land, in building, in rearing\r\nlive-stock, and the like occupations, the time passed pleasantly away\r\nuntil my retirement was interrupted by an invitation to take a place in\r\nthe Cabinet of Mr. Pierce, who had been elected to the Presidency of the\r\nUnited States in November, 1852. Although warmly attached to Mr. Pierce\r\npersonally, and entertaining the highest estimate of his character and\r\npolitical principles, private and personal reasons led me to decline the\r\noffer. This was followed by an invitation to attend the ceremony of his\r\ninauguration, which took place on the 4th of March, 1853. While in\r\nWashington, on this visit, I was induced by public considerations to\r\nreconsider my determination and accept the office of Secretary of War.\r\nThe public records of that period will best show how the duties of that\r\noffice were performed.\r\n\r\nWhile in the Senate, I had advocated the construction of a railway to\r\nconnect the valley of the Mississippi with the Pacific coast; and, when\r\nan appropriation was made to determine the most eligible route for that\r\npurpose, the Secretary of War was charged with its application. We had\r\nthen but little of that minute and accurate knowledge of the interior of\r\nthe continent which was requisite for a determination of the problem.\r\nSeveral different parties were therefore organized to examine the\r\nvarious routes supposed to be practicable within the northern and\r\nsouthern limits of the United States. The arguments which I had used as\r\na Senator were \"the military necessity for such means of transportation,\r\nand the need of safe and rapid communication with the Pacific slope, to\r\nsecure its continuance as a part of the Union.\"\r\n\r\nIn the organization and equipment of these parties, and in the selection\r\nof their officers, care was taken to provide for securing full and\r\naccurate information upon every point involved in the determination of\r\nthe route. The only discrimination made was in the more prompt and\r\nthorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line, and\r\nthis was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of\r\nexecution of all the surveys.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, my advocacy while in the Senate of an extension of the\r\nCapitol, by the construction of a new Senate-Chamber and Hall of\r\nRepresentatives, may have caused the appropriation for that object to be\r\nput under my charge as Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nDuring my administration of the War Department, material changes were\r\nmade in the models of arms. Iron gun-carriages were introduced, and\r\nexperiments were made which led to the casting of heavy guns hollow,\r\ninstead of boring them after casting. Inquiries were made with regard to\r\ngunpowder, which subsequently led to the use of a coarser grain for\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nDuring the same period the army was increased by the addition of two\r\nregiments of infantry and two of cavalry. The officers of these\r\nregiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in service\r\nin the regular army and partly by appointment from civil life. In making\r\nthe selections from the army, I was continually indebted to the\r\nassistance of that pure-minded and accurately informed officer, Colonel\r\nSamuel Cooper, the Adjutant-General, of whom it may be proper here to\r\nsay that, although his life had been spent in the army, and he, of\r\ncourse, had the likes and dislikes inseparable from men who are brought\r\ninto close contact and occasional rivalry, I never found in his official\r\nrecommendations any indication of partiality or prejudice toward any\r\none.\r\n\r\nWhen the first list was made out, to be submitted to the President, a\r\ndifficulty was found to exist, which had not occurred either to Colonel\r\nCooper or myself. This was, that the officers selected purely on their\r\nmilitary record did not constitute a roster conforming to that\r\ndistribution among the different States, which, for political\r\nconsiderations, it was thought desirable to observe--that is to say, the\r\nnumber of such officers of Southern birth was found to be\r\ndisproportionately great. Under instructions from the President, the\r\nlist was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new\r\nelement of geographical distribution. This, as I am happy to remember,\r\nwas the only occasion in which the current of my official action, while\r\nSecretary of War, was disturbed in any way by sectional or political\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nUnder former administrations of the War Office it had not been customary\r\nto make removals or appointments upon political grounds, except in the\r\ncase of clerkships. To this usage I not only adhered, but extended it to\r\ninclude the clerkships also. The Chief Clerk, who had been removed by my\r\npredecessor, had peculiar qualifications for the place; and, although\r\nknown to me only officially, he was restored to the position. It will\r\nprobably be conceded by all who are well informed on the subject that\r\nhis restoration was a benefit to the public service.[11]\r\n\r\n[The reader desirous for further information relative to the\r\nadministration of the War Department during this period may find it in\r\nthe various official reports and estimates of works of defense\r\nprosecuted or recommended, arsenals of construction and depots of arms\r\nmaintained or suggested, and foundries employed, during the Presidency\r\nof Mr. Pierce, 1853-'57.]\r\n\r\nHaving been again elected by the Legislature of Mississippi as Senator\r\nto the United States, I passed from the Cabinet of Mr. Pierce, on the\r\nlast day of his term (March 4, 1857), to take my seat in the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe Administration of Franklin Pierce presents the only instance in our\r\nhistory of the continuance of a Cabinet for four years without a single\r\nchange in its _personnel_. When it is remembered that there was much\r\ndissimilarity if not incongruity of character among the members of that\r\nCabinet, some idea may be formed of the power over men possessed and\r\nexercised by Mr. Pierce. Chivalrous, generous, amiable, true to his\r\nfriends and to his faith, frank and bold in the declaration of his\r\nopinions, he never deceived any one. And, if treachery had ever come\r\nnear him, it would have stood abashed in the presence of his truth, his\r\nmanliness, and his confiding simplicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Soon after my entrance upon duty as secretary of War,\r\nGeneral Jesup, the Quartermaster-General, presented to me a list of\r\nnames from which to make selection of a clerk for his department.\r\nObserving that he had attached certain figures to these names, I asked\r\nwhether the figures were intended to indicate the relative\r\nqualifications, or preference in his estimation, of the several\r\napplicants; and, upon his answer in the affirmative, without further\r\nquestion, authorized him to appoint \"No. 1\" of his list. A day or two\r\nafterward, certain Democratic members of Congress called on me and\r\npolitely inquired whether it was true that I had appointed a Whig to a\r\nposition in the War Office. \"Certainly not,\" I answered. \"We thought you\r\nwere not aware of it,\" said they, and proceeded to inform me that Mr.\r\n----, the recent appointee to the clerkship just mentioned, was a Whig.\r\nAfter listening patiently to this statement, I answered that it was they\r\nwho were deceived, not I. I had appointed a clerk. He had been appointed\r\nneither as a Whig nor as a Democrat, but merely as the fittest candidate\r\nfor the place in the estimation of the chief of the bureau to which it\r\nbelonged. I further gave them to understand that the same principle of\r\nselection would be followed in similar cases, so far as my authority\r\nextended. After some further discussion of the question, the visitors\r\nwithdrew, dissatisfied with the result of the interview.\r\n\r\nThe Quartermaster-General, on hearing of this conversation, hastened to\r\ninform me that it was all a mistake--that the appointee to the office\r\nhad been confounded with his father, who was a well-known Whig, but that\r\nhe (the son) was a Democrat. I assured the General that this was\r\naltogether immaterial, adding that it was \"a very pretty quarrel\" as it\r\nstood, and that I had no desire to effect a settlement of it on any\r\ninferior issue. Thenceforward, however, I was but little troubled with\r\nany pressure for political appointments in the department.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n    The Territorial Question.--An Incident at the White House.--The\r\n    Kansas and Nebraska Bill.--The Missouri Compromise abrogated in\r\n    1850, not in 1854.--Origin of \"Squatter Sovereignty.\"--Sectional\r\n    Rivalry and its Consequences.--The Emigrant Aid Societies.--\"The\r\n    Bible and Sharpe's Rifles.\"--False Pretensions as to\r\n    Principle.--The Strife in Kansas.--A Retrospect.--The Original\r\n    Equilibrium of Power and its Overthrow.--Usurpations of the\r\n    Federal Government.--The Protective Tariff.--Origin and Progress\r\n    of Abolitionism.--Who were the Friends of the Union?--An\r\n    Illustration of Political Morality.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Territory of Kansas was the first question that\r\ngave rise to exciting debate after my return to the Senate. The\r\ncelebrated Kansas-Nebraska Bill had become a law during the\r\nAdministration of Mr. Pierce. As this occupies a large space in the\r\npolitical history of the period, it is proper to state some facts\r\nconnected with it, which were not public, but were known to me and to\r\nothers yet living.\r\n\r\nThe declaration, often repeated in 1850, that climate and the will of\r\nthe people concerned should determine their institutions when they\r\nshould form a Constitution, and as a State be admitted into the Union,\r\nand that no legislation by Congress should be permitted to interfere\r\nwith the free exercise of that will when so expressed, was but the\r\nannouncement of the fact so firmly established in the Constitution, that\r\nsovereignty resided alone in the States, and that Congress had only\r\ndelegated powers. It has been sometimes contended that, because the\r\nCongress of the Confederation, by the Ordinance of 1787, prohibited\r\ninvoluntary servitude in all the Northwestern Territory, the framers of\r\nthe Constitution must have recognized such power to exist in the\r\nCongress of the United States. Hence the deduction that the prohibitory\r\nclause of what is known as the Missouri Compromise was justified by the\r\nprecedent of the Ordinance of 1787. To make the action of the Congress\r\nof the Confederation a precedent for the Congress of the United States\r\nis to overlook the great distinction between the two.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of the Confederation represented the States in their\r\nsovereignty, and, as such representatives, had legislative, executive,\r\nand, in some degree, judicial power confided to it. Virtually, it was an\r\nassemblage of the States. In certain cases a majority of nine States\r\nwere required to decide a question, but there is no express limitation,\r\nor restriction, such as is to be found in the ninth and tenth amendments\r\nto the Constitution of the United States. The General Government of the\r\nUnion is composed of three departments, of which the Congress is the\r\nlegislative branch, and which is checked by the revisory power of the\r\njudiciary, and the veto power of the Executive, and, above all, is\r\nexpressly limited in legislation to powers expressly delegated by the\r\nStates. If, then, it be admitted, which is certainly questionable, that\r\nthe Congress of the Confederation had power to exclude slave property\r\nnorthwest of the Ohio River, that power must have been derived from its\r\ncharacter as representing the States in their sovereignty, for no\r\nindication of such a power is to be found in the Articles of\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\nIf it be assumed that the absence of a prohibition was equivalent to the\r\nadmission of the power in the Congress of the Confederation, the\r\nassumption would avail nothing in the Congress under the Constitution,\r\nwhere power is expressly limited to what had been delegated. More\r\nbriefly, it may be stated that the Congress of the Confederation could,\r\nlike the Legislature of a State, do what had not been prohibited; but\r\nthe Congress of the United States could only do what had been expressly\r\npermitted. It is submitted whether this last position is not conclusive\r\nagainst the possession of power by the United States Congress to\r\nlegislate slavery into or exclude it from Territories belonging to the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThis subject, which had for more than a quarter of a century been one of\r\nangry discussion and sectional strife, was revived, and found occasion\r\nfor renewed discussion in the organization of Territorial governments\r\nfor Kansas and Nebraska. The Committees on Territories of the two Houses\r\nagreed to report a bill in accordance with that recognized principle,\r\nprovided they could first be assured that it would receive favorable\r\nconsideration from the President. This agreement was made on Saturday,\r\nand the ensuing Monday was the day (and the only day for two weeks) on\r\nwhich, according to the order of business established by the rules of\r\nthe House of Representatives, the bill could be introduced by the\r\nCommittee of that House.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, the 22d of January, 1854, gentlemen of each Committee\r\ncalled at my house, and Mr. Douglas, chairman of the Senate Committee,\r\nfully explained the proposed bill, and stated their purpose to be,\r\nthrough my aid, to obtain an interview on that day with the President,\r\nto ascertain whether the bill would meet his approbation. The President\r\nwas known to be rigidly opposed to the reception of visits on Sunday for\r\nthe discussion of any political subject; but in this case it was urged\r\nas necessary, in order to enable the Committee to make their report the\r\nnext day. I went with them to the Executive mansion, and, leaving them\r\nin the reception-room, sought the President in his private apartments,\r\nand explained to him the occasion of the visit. He thereupon met the\r\ngentlemen, patiently listened to the reading of the bill and their\r\nexplanations of it, decided that it rested upon sound constitutional\r\nprinciples, and recognized in it only a return to that rule which had\r\nbeen infringed by the compromise of 1820, and the restoration of which\r\nhad been foreshadowed by the legislation of 1850. This bill was not,\r\ntherefore, as has been improperly asserted, a measure inspired by Mr.\r\nPierce or any of his Cabinet. Nor was it the first step taken toward the\r\nrepeal of the conditions or obligations expressed or implied by the\r\nestablishment, in 1820, of the politico-sectional line of thirty-six\r\ndegrees and thirty minutes. That compact had been virtually abrogated,\r\nin 1850, by the refusal of the representatives of the North to apply it\r\nto the territory then recently acquired from Mexico. In May, 1854, the\r\nKansas-Nebraska Bill was passed; its purpose was declared in the bill\r\nitself to be to carry into practical operation the \"propositions and\r\nprinciples established by the compromise measures of 1850\" The \"Missouri\r\nCompromise,\" therefore, was not repealed by that bill--its virtual\r\nrepeal by the legislation of 1850 was recognized as an existing fact,\r\nand it was declared to be \"inoperative and void.\"\r\n\r\nIt was added that the \"true intent and meaning\" of the act was \"not to\r\nlegislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it\r\ntherefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and\r\nregulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the terms of this bill, as well as from the arguments that were\r\nused in its behalf, it is evident that its purpose was to leave the\r\nTerritories equally open to the people of all the States, with every\r\nspecies of property recognized by any of them; to permit climate and\r\nsoil to determine the current of immigration, and to secure to the\r\npeople themselves the right to form their own institutions according to\r\ntheir own will, as soon as they should acquire the right of\r\nself-government; that is to say, as soon as their numbers should entitle\r\nthem to organize themselves into a State, prepared to take its place as\r\nan equal, sovereign member of the Federal Union. The claim, afterward\r\nadvanced by Mr. Douglas and others, that this declaration was intended\r\nto assert the right of the first settlers of a Territory, in its\r\ninchoate, rudimental, dependent, and transitional condition, to\r\ndetermine the character of its institutions, constituted the doctrine\r\npopularly known as \"squatter sovereignty.\" Its assertion led to the\r\ndissensions which ultimately resulted in a rupture of the Democratic\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nSectional rivalry, the deadly foe of the \"domestic tranquillity\" and the\r\n\"general welfare,\" which the compact of union was formed to insure, now\r\ninterfered, with gigantic efforts, to prevent that free migration which\r\nhad been promised, and to hinder the decision by climate and the\r\ninterests of the inhabitants of the institutions to be established by\r\nthese embryo States. Societies were formed in the North to supply money\r\nand send emigrants into the new Territories; and a famous preacher,\r\naddressing a body of those emigrants, charged them to carry with them to\r\nKansas \"the Bible and Sharpe's rifles.\" The latter were of course to be\r\nleveled against the bosoms of their Southern brethren who might migrate\r\nto the same Territory, but the use to be made of the Bible in the same\r\nfraternal enterprise was left unexplained by the reverend gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe war-cry employed to train the Northern mind for the deeds\r\ncontemplated by the agitators was \"No extension of slavery!\" Was this\r\nsentiment real or feigned? The number of slaves (as has already been\r\nclearly shown) would not have been increased by their transportation to\r\nnew territory. It could not be augmented by further importation, for the\r\nlaw of the land made that piracy. Southern men were the leading authors\r\nof that enactment, and the public opinion of their descendants, stronger\r\nthan the law, fully sustained it. The climate of Kansas and Nebraska was\r\naltogether unsuited to the negro, and the soil was not adapted to those\r\nproductions for which negro labor could be profitably employed. If,\r\nthen, any negroes held to service or labor, as provided in the compact\r\nof union, had been transported to those Territories, they would have\r\nbeen such as were bound by personal attachment mutually existing between\r\nmaster and servant, which would have rendered it impossible for the\r\nformer to consider the latter as property convertible into money. As\r\nwhite laborers, adapted to the climate and its products, flowed into the\r\ncountry, negro labor would have inevitably become a tax to those who\r\nheld it, and their emancipation would have followed that condition, as\r\nit has in all the Northern States, old or new--Wisconsin furnishing the\r\nlast example.[12] It may, therefore, be reasonably concluded that the\r\n\"war-cry\" was employed by the artful to inflame the minds of the less\r\ninformed and less discerning; that it was adopted in utter disregard of\r\nthe means by which negro emancipation might have been peaceably\r\naccomplished in the Territories, and with the sole object of obtaining\r\nsectional control and personal promotion by means of popular agitation.\r\n\r\nThe success attending this artifice was remarkable. To such an extent\r\nwas it made available, that Northern indignation was aroused on the\r\nabsurd accusation that the South had destroyed \"that sacred instrument,\r\nthe compromise of 1820.\" The internecine war which raged in Kansas for\r\nseveral years was substituted for the promised peace under the operation\r\nof the natural laws regulating migration to new countries. For the\r\nfratricide which dyed the virgin soil of Kansas with the blood of those\r\nwho should have stood shoulder to shoulder in subduing the wilderness;\r\nfor the frauds which corrupted the ballot-box and made the name of\r\nelection a misnomer--let the authors of \"squatter sovereignty\" and the\r\nfomenters of sectional hatred answer to the posterity for whose peace\r\nand happiness the fathers formed the Federal compact.\r\n\r\nIn these scenes of strife were trained the incendiaries who afterward\r\ninvaded Virginia under the leadership of John Brown; and at this time\r\ngerminated the sentiments which led men of high position to sustain,\r\nwith their influence and their money, this murderous incursion into the\r\nSouth.[13]\r\n\r\nNow was seen the lightning of that storm, the distant muttering of which\r\nhad been heard so long, and against which the wise and the patriotic had\r\ngiven solemn warning, regarding it as the sign which portended a\r\ndissolution of the Union.\r\n\r\nDiversity of interests and of opinions among the States of the\r\nConfederation had in the beginning presented great difficulties in the\r\nway of the formation of a more perfect union. The compact was the result\r\nof compromise between the States, at that time generally distinguished\r\nas navigating and agricultural, afterward as Northern and Southern. When\r\nthe first census was taken, in 1790, there was but little numerical\r\ndifference in the population of these two sections, and (including\r\nStates about to be admitted) there was also an exact equality in the\r\nnumber of States. Each section had, therefore, the power of\r\nself-protection, and might feel secure against any danger of Federal\r\naggression. If the disturbance of that equilibrium had been the\r\nconsequence of natural causes, and the government of the whole had\r\ncontinued to be administered strictly for the general welfare, there\r\nwould have been no ground for complaint of the result.\r\n\r\nUnder the old Confederation the Southern States had a large excess of\r\nterritory. The acquisition of Louisiana, of Florida, and of Texas,\r\nafterward greatly increased this excess. The generosity and patriotism\r\nof Virginia led her, before the adoption of the Constitution, to cede\r\nthe Northwest Territory to the United States. The \"Missouri Compromise\"\r\nsurrendered to the North all the newly acquired region not included in\r\nthe State of Missouri, and north of the parallel of thirty-six degrees\r\nand a half. The northern part of Texas was in like manner given up by\r\nthe compromise of 1850; and the North, having obtained, by those\r\nsuccessive cessions, a majority in both Houses of Congress, took to\r\nitself all the territory acquired from Mexico. Thus, by the action of\r\nthe General Government, the means were provided permanently to destroy\r\nthe original equilibrium between the sections.\r\n\r\nNor was this the only injury to which the South was subjected. Under the\r\npower of Congress to levy duties on imports, tariff laws were enacted,\r\nnot merely \"to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and\r\ngeneral welfare of the United States,\" as authorized by the\r\nConstitution, but, positively and primarily, for the protection against\r\nforeign competition of domestic manufactures. The effect of this was to\r\nimpose the main burden of taxation upon the Southern people, who were\r\nconsumers and not manufacturers, not only by the enhanced price of\r\nimports, but indirectly by the consequent depreciation in the value of\r\nexports, which were chiefly the products of Southern States. The\r\nimposition of this grievance was unaccompanied by the consolation of\r\nknowing that the tax thus borne was to be paid into the public Treasury,\r\nfor the increase of price accrued mainly to the benefit of the\r\nmanufacturer. Nor was this all: a reference to the annual appropriations\r\nwill show that the disbursements made were as unequal as the burdens\r\nborne--the inequality in both operating in the same direction.\r\n\r\nThese causes all combined to direct immigration to the Northern section;\r\nand with the increase of its preponderance appeared more and more\r\ndistinctly a tendency in the Federal Government to pervert functions\r\ndelegated to it, and to use them with sectional discrimination against\r\nthe minority.\r\n\r\nThe resistance to the admission of Missouri as a State, in 1820, was\r\nevidently not owing to any moral or constitutional considerations, but\r\nmerely to political motives; and the compensation exacted for granting\r\nwhat was simply a right, was the exclusion of the South from equality in\r\nthe enjoyment of territory which justly belonged equally to both, and\r\nwhich was what the enemies of the South stigmatized as \"slave\r\nterritory,\" when acquired.\r\n\r\nThe sectional policy then indicated brought to its support the passions\r\nthat spring from man's higher nature, but which, like all passions, if\r\nmisdirected and perverted, become hurtful and, it may be, destructive.\r\nThe year 1835 was marked by the public agitation for the abolition of\r\nthat African servitude which existed in the South, which antedated the\r\nUnion, and had existed in every one of the States that formed the\r\nConfederation. By a great misconception of the powers belonging to the\r\nGeneral Government, and the responsibilities of citizens of the Northern\r\nStates, many of those citizens were, little by little, brought to the\r\nconclusion that slavery was a sin for which _they_ were answerable, and\r\nthat it was the duty of the Federal Government to abate it. Though, at\r\nthe date above referred to, numerically so weak, when compared with\r\neither of the political parties at the North, as to excite no\r\napprehension of their power for evil, the public demonstrations of the\r\nAbolitionists were violently rebuked generally at the North. The party\r\nwas contemned on account of the character of its leaders, and the more\r\nodious because chief among them was an Englishman, one Thompson, who was\r\nsupposed to be an emissary, whose mission was to prepare the way for a\r\ndissolution of the Union. Let us hope that it was reverence for the\r\nobligations of the Constitution as the soul of the Union that suggested\r\nlurking danger, and rendered the supposed emissary for its destruction\r\nso odious that he was driven from a Massachusetts hall where he\r\nattempted to lecture. But bodies in motion will overcome bodies at rest,\r\nand the unreflecting too often are led by captivating names far from the\r\nprinciples they revere.\r\n\r\nThus, by the activity of the propagandists of abolitionism, and the\r\nmisuse of the sacred word Liberty, they recruited from the ardent\r\nworshipers of that goddess such numbers as gave them in many Northern\r\nStates the balance of power between the two great political forces that\r\nstood arrayed against each other; then and there they came to be courted\r\nby both of the great parties, especially by the Whigs, who had become\r\nthe weaker party of the two. Fanaticism, to which is usually accorded\r\nsincerity as an extenuation of its mischievous tenets, affords the best\r\nexcuse to be offered for the original abolitionists, but that can not be\r\nconceded to the political associates who joined them for the purpose of\r\nacquiring power; with them it was but hypocritical cant, intended to\r\ndeceive. Hence arose the declaration of the existence of an\r\n\"irrepressible conflict,\" because of the domestic institutions of\r\nsovereign, self-governing States--institutions over which neither the\r\nFederal Government nor the people outside of the limits of such States\r\nhad any control, and for which they could have no moral or legal\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nThose who are to come after us, and who will look without prejudice or\r\nexcitement at the record of events which have occurred in our day, will\r\nnot fail to wonder how men professing and proclaiming such a belief\r\nshould have so far imposed upon the credulity of the world as to be able\r\nto arrogate to themselves the claim of being the special friends of a\r\nUnion contracted in order to insure \"domestic tranquillity\" among the\r\npeople of the States united; that _they_ were the advocates of peace, of\r\nlaw, and of order, who, when taking an oath to support and maintain the\r\nConstitution, did so with a mental reservation to violate one of the\r\nprovisions of that Constitution--one of the conditions of the\r\ncompact--without which the Union could never have been formed. The tone\r\nof political morality which could make this possible was well indicated\r\nby the toleration accorded in the Senate to the flippant,\r\ninconsequential excuse for it given by one of its most eminent\r\nexemplars--\"Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this\r\nthing?\"--meaning thereby, not that it would be the part of a dog to\r\n_violate_ his oath, but to _keep_ it in the matter referred to. (See\r\nAppendix D.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Extract from a speech of Mr. Davis, of Mississippi, in the\r\nSenate of the United States, May 17, 1860: \"There is a relation\r\nbelonging to this species of property, unlike that of the apprentice or\r\nthe hired man, which awakens whatever there is of kindness or of\r\nnobility of soul in the heart of him who owns it; this can only be\r\nalienated, obscured, or destroyed, by collecting this species of\r\nproperty into such masses that the owner is not personally acquainted\r\nwith the individuals who compose it. In the relation, however, which can\r\nexist in the Northwestern Territories, the mere domestic connection of\r\none, two, or at most half a dozen servants in a family, associating with\r\nthe children as they grow up, attending upon age as it declines, there\r\ncan be nothing against which either philanthropy or humanity can make an\r\nappeal. Not even the emancipationist could raise his voice; for this is\r\nthe high-road and the open gate to the condition in which the masters\r\nwould, from interest, in a few years, desire the emancipation of every\r\none who may thus be taken to the northwestern frontier.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: See \"Report of Senate Committee of Inquiry into the John\r\nBrown Raid.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n    Agitation continued.--Political Parties: their Origin, Changes,\r\n    and Modifications.--Some Account of the \"Popular Sovereignty,\"\r\n    or \"Non-Intervention,\" Theory.--Rupture of the Democratic\r\n    Party.--The John Brown Raid.--Resolutions introduced by the\r\n    Author into the Senate on the Relations of the States, the\r\n    Federal Government, and the Territories; their Discussion and\r\n    Adoption.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strife in Kansas and the agitation of the territorial question in\r\nCongress and throughout the country continued during nearly the whole of\r\nMr. Buchanan's Administration, finally culminating in a disruption of\r\nthe Union. Meantime the changes, or modifications, which had occurred or\r\nwere occurring in the great political parties, were such as may require\r\na word of explanation to the reader not already familiar with their\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe _names_ adopted by political parties in the United States have not\r\nalways been strictly significant of their principles. The old Federal\r\nparty inclined to nationalism, or consolidation, rather than\r\nfederalization, of the States. On the other hand, the party originally\r\nknown as Republican, and afterward as Democratic, can scarcely claim to\r\nhave been distinctively or exclusively such in the primary sense of\r\nthese terms, inasmuch as no party has ever avowed opposition to the\r\ngeneral principles of government by the people. The fundamental idea of\r\nthe Democratic party was that of the sovereignty of the States and the\r\nfederal, or confederate, character of the Union. Other elements have\r\nentered into its organization at different periods, but this has been\r\nthe vital, cardinal, and abiding principle on which its existence has\r\nbeen perpetuated. The Whig, which succeeded the old Federal party,\r\nthough by no means identical with it, was, in the main, favorable to a\r\nstrong central government, therein antagonizing the transatlantic\r\ntraditions connected with its name. The \"Know-Nothing,\" or \"American,\"\r\nparty, which sprang into existence on the decadence of the Whig\r\norganization, based upon opposition to the alleged overgrowth of the\r\npolitical influence of naturalized foreigners and of the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch, had but a brief duration, and after the Presidential election of\r\n1856 declined as rapidly as it had arisen.\r\n\r\nAt the period to which this narrative has advanced, the \"Free-Soil,\"\r\nwhich had now assumed the title of \"Republican\" party, had grown to a\r\nmagnitude which threatened speedily to obtain entire control of the\r\nGovernment. Based, as has been shown, upon sectional rivalry and\r\nopposition to the growth of the Southern equally with the Northern\r\nStates of the Union, it had absorbed within itself not only the\r\nabolitionists, who were avowedly agitating for the destruction of the\r\nsystem of negro servitude, but other diverse and heterogeneous elements\r\nof opposition to the Democratic party. In the Presidential election of\r\n1856, their candidates (Fremont and Dayton) had received 114 of a total\r\nof 296 electoral votes, representing a popular vote of 1,341,264 in a\r\ntotal of 4,053,967. The elections of the ensuing year (1857) exhibited a\r\ndiminution of the so-called \"Republican\" strength, and the Thirty-fifth\r\nCongress, which convened in December of that year, was decidedly\r\nDemocratic in both branches. In the course of the next two years,\r\nhowever, the Kansas agitation and another cause, to be presently\r\nnoticed, had so swollen the ranks of the so-called Republicans, that, in\r\nthe House of Representatives of the Thirty-sixth Congress, which met in\r\nDecember, 1859, neither party had a decided majority, the balance of\r\npower being held by a few members still adhering to the virtually\r\nextinct Whig and \"American,\" or Know-Nothing, organizations, and a still\r\nsmaller number whose position was doubtful or irregular. More than eight\r\nweeks were spent in the election of a Speaker; and a so-called\r\n\"Republican\" (Mr. Pennington, of New Jersey) was finally elected by a\r\nmajority of one vote. The Senate continued to be decidedly Democratic,\r\nthough with an increase of the so-called \"Republican\" minority.\r\n\r\nThe cause above alluded to, as contributing to the rapid growth of the\r\nso-called Republican party after the elections of the year 1857, was the\r\ndissension among the Democrats, occasioned by the introduction of the\r\ndoctrine called by its inventors and advocates \"popular sovereignty,\" or\r\n\"non-intervention,\" but more generally and more accurately known as\r\n\"squatter sovereignty.\" Its character has already been concisely stated\r\nin the preceding chapter. Its origin is generally attributed to General\r\nCass, who is supposed to have suggested it in some general expressions\r\nof his celebrated \"Nicholson letter,\" written in December, 1847. On the\r\n16th and 17th of May, 1860, it became necessary for me in a debate, in\r\nthe Senate, to review that letter of Mr. Cass. From my remarks then\r\nmade, the following extract is taken:\r\n\r\n    \"The Senator [Mr. Douglas] might have remembered, if he had\r\n    chosen to recollect so unimportant a thing, that I once had to\r\n    explain to him, ten years ago, the fact that I repudiated the\r\n    doctrine of that letter at the time it was published, and that\r\n    the Democracy of Mississippi had well-nigh crucified me for the\r\n    construction which I placed upon it. There were men mean enough\r\n    to suspect that the construction I gave to the Nicholson letter\r\n    was prompted by the confidence and affection I felt for General\r\n    Taylor. At a subsequent period, however, Mr. Cass thoroughly\r\n    reviewed it. He uttered (for him) very harsh language against\r\n    all who had doubted the true construction of his letter, and he\r\n    construed it just as I had done during the canvass of 1848. It\r\n    remains only to add that I supported Mr. Cass, not because of\r\n    the doctrine of the Nicholson letter, but in despite of it;\r\n    because I believed a Democratic President, with a Democratic\r\n    Cabinet and Democratic counselors in the two Houses of Congress,\r\n    and he as honest a man as I believed Mr. Cass to be, would be a\r\n    safer reliance than his opponent, who personally possessed my\r\n    confidence as much as any man living, but who was of, and must\r\n    draw his advisers from, a party the tenets of which I believed\r\n    to be opposed to the interests of the country, as they were to\r\n    all my political convictions.\r\n\r\n    \"I little thought at that time that my advocacy of Mr. Cass upon\r\n    such grounds as these, or his support by the State of which I am\r\n    a citizen, would at any future day be quoted as an endorsement\r\n    of the opinions contained in the Nicholson letter, as those\r\n    opinions were afterward defined. But it is not only upon this\r\n    letter, but equally upon the resolutions of the Convention as\r\n    constructive of that letter, that the Senator rested his\r\n    argument. [I will here say to the Senator that, if at any time I\r\n    do him the least injustice, speaking as I do from such notes as\r\n    I could take while he progressed, I will thank him to correct\r\n    me.]\r\n\r\n    \"But this letter entered into the canvass; there was a doubt\r\n    about its construction: there were men who asserted that they\r\n    had positive authority for saying that it meant that the people\r\n    of a Territory could only exclude slavery when the Territory\r\n    should form a Constitution and be admitted as a State. This\r\n    doubt continued to hang over the construction, and it was that\r\n    doubt alone which secured Mr. Cass the vote of Mississippi. If\r\n    the true construction had been certainly known, he would have\r\n    had no chance to get it.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever meaning the generally discreet and conservative statesman, Mr.\r\nCass, may have intended to convey, it is not at all probable that he\r\nforesaw the extent to which the suggestions would be carried and the\r\nconsequences that would result from it.\r\n\r\nIn the organization of a government for California in 1850, the theory\r\nwas more distinctly advanced, but it was not until after the passage of\r\nthe Kansas-Nebraska Bill, in 1854, that it was fully developed under the\r\nplastic and constructive genius of the Hon. Stephen A. Douglas, of\r\nIllinois. The leading part which that distinguished Senator had borne in\r\nthe authorship and advocacy of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, which affirmed\r\nthe right of the people of the Territories \"to form and regulate their\r\ndomestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution\r\nof the United States,\" had aroused against him a violent storm of\r\ndenunciation in the State which he represented and other Northern\r\nStates. He met it very manfully in some respects, defended his action\r\nresolutely, but in so doing was led to make such concessions of\r\nprinciple and to attach such an interpretation to the bill as would have\r\nrendered it practically nugatory--a thing to keep the promise of peace\r\nto the ear and break it to the hope.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution expressly confers upon Congress the power to admit new\r\nStates into the Union, and also to \"dispose of and make all needful\r\nrules and regulations respecting the territory or other property\r\nbelonging to the United States.\" Under these grants of power, the\r\nuniform practice of the Government had been for Congress to lay off and\r\ndivide the common territory by convenient boundaries for the formation\r\nof future States; to provide executive, legislative, and judicial\r\ndepartments of government for such Territories during their temporary\r\nand provisional period of pupilage; to delegate to these governments\r\nsuch authority as might be expedient--subject always to the supervision\r\nand controlling government of the Congress. Finally, at the proper time,\r\nand on the attainment by the Territory of sufficient strength and\r\npopulation for self-government, to receive it into the Union on a\r\nfooting of entire equality with the original States--sovereign and\r\nself-governing. All this is no more inconsistent with the true\r\nprinciples of \"popular sovereignty,\" properly understood, than the\r\ntemporary subjection of a minor to parental control is inconsistent with\r\nthe doctrines of the Declaration of Independence, or the exceptional\r\ndiscipline of a man-of-war or a military post with the principles of\r\nrepublican freedom.\r\n\r\nThe usual process of transition from a territorial condition to that of\r\na State was, in the first place, by an act of Congress authorizing the\r\ninhabitants to elect representatives for a convention to form a State\r\nConstitution, which was then submitted to Congress for approval and\r\nratification. On such ratification the supervisory control of Congress\r\nwas withdrawn, and the new State authorized to assume its sovereignty,\r\nand the inhabitants of the Territory became citizens of a State. In the\r\ncases of Tennessee in 1796, and Arkansas and Michigan in 1836, the\r\nfailure of the inhabitants to obtain an \"enabling act\" of Congress,\r\nbefore organizing themselves, very nearly caused the rejection of their\r\napplications for admission as States, though they were eventually\r\ngranted on the ground that the subsequent approval and consent of\r\nCongress could heal the prior irregularity. The entire control of\r\nCongress over the whole subject of territorial government had never been\r\nquestioned in earlier times. Necessarily conjoined with the _power_ of\r\nthis protectorate, was of course the _duty_ of exercising it for the\r\nsafety of the persons and property of all citizens of the United States,\r\npermanently or temporarily resident in any part of the domain belonging\r\nto the States in common.\r\n\r\nLogically carried out, the new theory of \"popular sovereignty\" would\r\napply to the first adventurous pioneers settling in the wilderness\r\nbefore the organization of any Territorial government by Congress, as\r\nwell as afterward. If \"sovereignty\" is inherent in a thousand or five\r\nthousand persons, there can be no valid ground for denying its existence\r\nin a dozen, as soon as they pass beyond the limits of the State\r\ngovernments. The advocates of this novel doctrine, however, if rightly\r\nunderstood, generally disavowed any claim to its application prior to\r\nthe organization of a territorial government.\r\n\r\nThe Territorial Legislatures, to which Congress delegated a portion of\r\nits power and duty to \"make all needful rules and regulations respecting\r\nthe Territory,\" were the mere agents of Congress, exercising an\r\nauthority subject to Congressional supervision and control--an authority\r\nconferred only for the sake of convenience, and liable at any time to be\r\nrevoked and annulled. Yet it is proposed to recognize in these\r\nprovisional, subordinate, and temporary legislative bodies, a power not\r\npossessed by Congress itself. This is to claim that the creature is\r\nendowed with an authority not possessed by the creator, or that the\r\nstream has risen to an elevation above that of its source.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in contending for a power in the Territorial Legislatures\r\npermanently to determine the fundamental, social, and political\r\ninstitutions of the Territory, and thereby virtually to prescribe those\r\nof the future State, the advocates of \"popular sovereignty\" were\r\ninvesting those dependent and subsidiary bodies with powers far above\r\nany exercised by the Legislatures of the fully organized and sovereign\r\nStates. The authority of the State Legislatures is limited, both by the\r\nFederal Constitution and by the respective State Constitutions from\r\nwhich it is derived. This latter limitation did not and could not exist\r\nin the Territories.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, a theory founded on fallacies so flimsy and\r\nleading to conclusions so paradoxical was advanced by eminent and\r\nexperienced politicians, and accepted by many persons, both in the North\r\nand in the South--not so much, perhaps, from intelligent conviction as\r\nunder the delusive hope that it would afford a satisfactory settlement\r\nof the \"irrepressible conflict\" which had been declared. The terms\r\n\"popular sovereignty\" and \"non-intervention\" were plausible, specious,\r\nand captivating to the public ear. Too many lost sight of the elementary\r\ntruth that political sovereignty does not reside in unorganized or\r\npartially organized masses of individuals, but in the people of\r\nregularly and permanently constituted States. As to the\r\n\"non-intervention\" proposed, it meant merely the abnegation by Congress\r\nof its duty to protect the inhabitants of the Territories subject to its\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThe raid into Virginia under John Brown--already notorious as a\r\nfanatical partisan leader in the Kansas troubles--occurred in October,\r\n1859, a few weeks before the meeting of the Thirty-sixth Congress.\r\nInsignificant in itself and in its immediate results, it afforded a\r\nstartling revelation of the extent to which sectional hatred and\r\npolitical fanaticism had blinded the conscience of a class of persons in\r\ncertain States of the Union; forming a party steadily growing stronger\r\nin numbers, as well as in activity. Sympathy with its purposes or\r\nmethods was earnestly disclaimed by the representatives of all parties\r\nin Congress; but it was charged, on the other hand, that it was only the\r\nnatural outgrowth of doctrines and sentiments which for some years had\r\nbeen freely avowed on the floors of both Houses. A committee of the\r\nSenate made a long and laborious investigation of the facts, with no\r\nvery important or satisfactory results. In their final report, June 15,\r\n1860, accompanying the evidence obtained and submitted, this Committee\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    \"It [the incursion] was simply the act of lawless ruffians,\r\n    under the sanction of no public or political authority,\r\n    distinguishable only from ordinary felonies by the ulterior ends\r\n    in contemplation by them, and by the fact that the money to\r\n    maintain the expedition, and the large armament they brought\r\n    with them, had been contributed and furnished by the citizens of\r\n    other States of the Union under circumstances that must continue\r\n    to jeopard the safety and peace of the Southern States, and\r\n    against which Congress has no power to legislate.\r\n\r\n    \"If the several States [adds the Committee], whether from\r\n    motives of policy or a desire to preserve the peace of the\r\n    Union, if not from fraternal feeling, do not hold it incumbent\r\n    on them, after the experience of the country, to guard in future\r\n    by appropriate legislation against occurrences similar to the\r\n    one here inquired into, the Committee can find no guarantee\r\n    elsewhere for the security of peace between the States of the\r\n    Union.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 2, 1860, the author submitted, in the Senate of the United\r\nStates, a series of resolutions, afterward slightly modified to read as\r\nfollows\r\n\r\n    \"1. _Resolved_, That, in the adoption of the Federal\r\n    Constitution, the States, adopting the same, acted severally as\r\n    free and independent sovereignties, delegating a portion of\r\n    their powers to be exercised by the Federal Government for the\r\n    increased security of each against dangers, _domestic_ as well\r\n    as foreign; and that any intermeddling by any one or more\r\n    States, or by a combination of their citizens, with the domestic\r\n    institutions of the others, on any pretext whatever, political,\r\n    moral, or religious, with the view to their disturbance or\r\n    subversion, is in violation of the Constitution, insulting to\r\n    the States so interfered with, endangers their domestic peace\r\n    and tranquillity--objects for which the Constitution was\r\n    formed--and, by necessary consequence, tends to weaken and\r\n    destroy the Union itself.\r\n\r\n    \"2. _Resolved_, That negro slavery, as it exists in fifteen\r\n    States of this Union, composes an important portion of their\r\n    domestic institutions, inherited from our ancestors, and\r\n    existing at the adoption of the Constitution, by which it is\r\n    recognized as constituting an important element in the\r\n    apportionment of powers among the States, and that no change of\r\n    opinion or feeling on the part of the non-slaveholding States of\r\n    the Union in relation to this institution can justify them or\r\n    their citizens in open or covert attacks thereon, with a view to\r\n    its overthrow; and that all such attacks are in manifest\r\n    violation of the mutual and solemn pledge to protect and defend\r\n    each other, given by the States respectively, on entering into\r\n    the constitutional compact which formed the Union, and are a\r\n    manifest breach of faith and a violation of the most solemn\r\n    obligations.\r\n\r\n    \"3. _Resolved_, That the Union of these States rests on the\r\n    equality of rights and privileges among its members, and that it\r\n    is especially the duty of the Senate, which represents the\r\n    States in their sovereign capacity, to resist all attempts to\r\n    discriminate either in relation to persons or property in the\r\n    Territories, which are the common possessions of the United\r\n    States, so as to give advantages to the citizens of one State\r\n    which are not equally assured to those of every other State.\r\n\r\n    \"4. _Resolved_, That neither Congress nor a Territorial\r\n    Legislature, whether by direct legislation or legislation of an\r\n    indirect and unfriendly character, possesses power to annul or\r\n    impair the constitutional right of any citizen of the United\r\n    States to take his slave property into the common Territories,\r\n    and there hold and enjoy the same while the territorial\r\n    condition remains.\r\n\r\n    \"5. _Resolved_, That if experience should at any time prove that\r\n    the judiciary and executive authority do not possess means to\r\n    insure adequate protection to constitutional rights in a\r\n    Territory, and if the Territorial government shall fail or\r\n    refuse to provide the necessary remedies for that purpose, it\r\n    will be the duty of Congress to supply such deficiency.[14]\r\n\r\n    \"6. _Resolved_, That the inhabitants of a Territory of the\r\n    United States, when they rightfully form a Constitution to be\r\n    admitted as a State into the Union, may then, for the first\r\n    time, like the people of a State when forming a new\r\n    Constitution, decide for themselves whether slavery, as a\r\n    domestic institution, shall be maintained or prohibited within\r\n    their jurisdiction; and they shall be received into the Union\r\n    with or without slavery, as their Constitution may prescribe at\r\n    the time of their admission.\r\n\r\n    \"7. _Resolved_, That the provision of the Constitution for the\r\n    rendition of fugitives from service or labor, 'without the\r\n    adoption of which the Union could not have been formed,' and\r\n    that the laws of 1793 and 1850, which were enacted to secure its\r\n    execution, and the main features of which, being similar, bear\r\n    the impress of nearly seventy years of sanction by the highest\r\n    judicial authority, should be honestly and faithfully observed\r\n    and maintained by all who enjoy the benefits of our compact of\r\n    union; and that all acts of individuals or of State Legislatures\r\n    to defeat the purpose or nullify the requirements of that\r\n    provision, and the laws made in pursuance of it, are hostile in\r\n    character, subversive of the Constitution, and revolutionary in\r\n    their effect.\"[15]\r\n\r\nAfter a protracted and earnest debate, these resolutions were adopted\r\n_seriatim_, on the 24th and 25th of May, by a decided majority of the\r\nSenate (varying from thirty-three to thirty-six yeas against from two to\r\ntwenty-one nays), the Democrats, both Northern and Southern, sustaining\r\nthem unitedly, with the exception of one adverse vote (that of Mr. Pugh,\r\nof Ohio) on the fourth and sixth resolutions. The Republicans all voted\r\nagainst them or refrained from voting at all, except that Mr. Teneyck,\r\nof New Jersey, voted for the fifth and seventh of the series. Mr.\r\nDouglas, the leader if not the author of \"popular sovereignty,\" was\r\nabsent on account of illness, and there were a few other absentees.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of a speech, in reply to Mr. Douglas, a few days before\r\nthe vote was taken on these resolutions, is introduced here as the best\r\nevidence of the position of the author at that period of excitement and\r\nagitation:\r\n\r\n    Conclusion of Reply to Mr. Douglas, _May 17, 1860_.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. President: I briefly and reluctantly referred, because the\r\n    subject had been introduced, to the attitude of Mississippi on a\r\n    former occasion. I will now as briefly say that in 1851, and in\r\n    1860, Mississippi was, and is, ready to make every concession\r\n    which it becomes her to make to the welfare and the safety of\r\n    the Union. If, on a former occasion, she hoped too much from\r\n    fraternity, the responsibility for her disappointment rests upon\r\n    those who failed to fulfill her expectations. She still clings\r\n    to the Government as our fathers formed it. She is ready to-day\r\n    and to-morrow, as in her past and though brief yet brilliant\r\n    history, to maintain that Government in all its power, and to\r\n    vindicate its honor with all the means she possesses. I say\r\n    brilliant history; for it was in the very morning of her\r\n    existence that her sons, on the plains of New Orleans, were\r\n    announced, in general orders, to have been the admiration of one\r\n    army and the wonder of the other. That we had a division in\r\n    relation to the measures enacted in 1850, is true; that the\r\n    Southern rights men became the minority in the election which\r\n    resulted, is true; but no figure of speech could warrant the\r\n    Senator in speaking of them as subdued--as coming to him or\r\n    anybody else for quarter. I deemed it offensive when it was\r\n    uttered, and the scorn with which I repelled it at the instant,\r\n    time has only softened to contempt. Our flag was never borne\r\n    from the field. We had carried it in the face of defeat, with a\r\n    knowledge that defeat awaited it; but scarcely had the smoke of\r\n    the battle passed away which proclaimed another victor, before\r\n    the general voice admitted that the field again was ours. I have\r\n    not seen a sagacious, reflecting man, who was cognizant of the\r\n    events as they transpired at the time, who does not say that,\r\n    within two weeks after the election, our party was in a\r\n    majority; and the next election which occurred showed that we\r\n    possessed the State beyond controversy. How we have wielded that\r\n    power it is not for me to say. I trust others may see\r\n    forbearance in our conduct--that, with a determination to insist\r\n    upon our constitutional rights, then and now, there is an\r\n    unwavering desire to maintain the Government, and to uphold the\r\n    Democratic party.\r\n\r\n    \"We believe now, as we have asserted on former occasions, that\r\n    the best hope for the perpetuity of our institutions depends\r\n    upon the coöperation, the harmony, the zealous action, of the\r\n    Democratic party. We cling to that party from conviction that\r\n    its principles and its aims are those of truth and the country,\r\n    as we cling to the Union for the fulfillment of the purposes for\r\n    which it was formed. Whenever we shall be taught that the\r\n    Democratic party is recreant to its principles; whenever we\r\n    shall learn that it can not be relied upon to maintain the great\r\n    measures which constitute its vitality--I for one shall be ready\r\n    to leave it. And so, when we declare our tenacious adherence to\r\n    the Union, it is the Union of the Constitution. If the compact\r\n    between the States is to be trampled into the dust; if anarchy\r\n    is to be substituted for the usurpation and consolidation which\r\n    threatened the Government at an earlier period; if the Union is\r\n    to become powerless for the purposes for which it was\r\n    established, and we are vainly to appeal to it for\r\n    protection--then, sir, conscious of the rectitude of our course,\r\n    the justice of our cause, self-reliant, yet humbly, confidingly\r\n    trusting in the arm that guided and protected our fathers, we\r\n    look beyond the confines of the Union for the maintenance of our\r\n    rights. An habitual reverence and cherished affection for the\r\n    Government will bind us to it longer than our interests would\r\n    suggest or require; but he is a poor student of the world's\r\n    history who does not understand that communities at last must\r\n    yield to the dictates of their interests. That the affection,\r\n    the mutual desire for the mutual good, which existed among our\r\n    fathers, may be weakened in succeeding generations by the denial\r\n    of right, and hostile demonstration, until the equality\r\n    guaranteed but not secured within the Union may be sought for\r\n    without it, must be evident to even a careless observer of our\r\n    race. It is time to be up and doing. There is yet time to remove\r\n    the causes of dissension and alienation which are now\r\n    distracting, and have for years past divided, the country.\r\n\r\n    \"If the Senator correctly described me as having at a former\r\n    period, against my own preferences and opinions, acquiesced in\r\n    the decision of my party; if, when I had youth, when physical\r\n    vigor gave promise of many days, and the future was painted in\r\n    the colors of hope, I could thus surrender my own convictions,\r\n    my own prejudices, and coöperate with my political friends\r\n    according to their views of the best method of promoting the\r\n    public good--now, when the years of my future can not be many,\r\n    and experience has sobered the hopeful tints of youth's gilding;\r\n    when, approaching the evening of life, the shadows are reversed,\r\n    and the mind turns retrospectively, it is not to be supposed\r\n    that I would abandon lightly, or idly put on trial, the party to\r\n    which I have steadily adhered. It is rather to be assumed that\r\n    conservatism, which belongs to the timidity or caution of\r\n    increasing years, would lead me to cling to, to be supported by,\r\n    rather than to cast off, the organization with which I have been\r\n    so long connected. If I am driven to consider the necessity of\r\n    separating myself from those old and dear relations, of\r\n    discarding the accustomed support, under circumstances such as I\r\n    have described, might not my friends who differ from me pause\r\n    and inquire whether there is not something involved in it which\r\n    calls for their careful revision?\r\n\r\n    \"I desire no divided flag for the Democratic party.\r\n\r\n    \"Our principles are national; they belong to every State of the\r\n    Union; and, though elections may be lost by their assertion,\r\n    they constitute the only foundation on which we can maintain\r\n    power, on which we can again rise to the dignity the Democracy\r\n    once possessed. Does not the Senator from Illinois see in the\r\n    sectional character of the vote be received,[16] that his\r\n    opinions are not acceptable to every portion of the country? Is\r\n    not the fact that the resolutions adopted by seventeen States,\r\n    on which the greatest reliance must be placed for Democratic\r\n    support, are in opposition to the dogma to which he still\r\n    clings, a warning that, if he persists and succeeds in forcing\r\n    his theory upon the Democratic party, its days are numbered? We\r\n    ask only for the Constitution. We ask of the Democracy only from\r\n    time to time to declare, as current exigencies may indicate,\r\n    what the Constitution was intended to secure and provide. Our\r\n    flag bears no new device.

It required all the\r\npower of wisdom and patriotism, animated by the affection engendered by\r\ncommon sufferings and dangers, to keep these rivalries under restraint,\r\nand to effect those compromises which it was fondly hoped would insure\r\nthe harmony and mutual good offices of each for the benefit of all. It\r\nwas in this spirit of patriotism and confidence in the continuance of\r\nsuch abiding good will as would for all time preclude hostile\r\naggression, that Virginia ceded, for the use of the confederated States,\r\nall that vast extent of territory lying north of the Ohio River, out of\r\nwhich have since been formed five States and part of a sixth. The\r\naddition of these States has accrued entirely to the preponderance of\r\nthe Northern section over that from which the donation proceeded, and to\r\nthe disturbance of that equilibrium which existed at the close of the\r\nwar of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place here to refer to the fact that the grievances\r\nwhich led to that war were directly inflicted upon the Northern\r\ncolonies. Those of the South had no material cause of complaint; but,\r\nactuated by sympathy for their Northern brethren, and a devotion to the\r\nprinciples of civil liberty and community independence, which they had\r\ninherited from their Anglo-Saxon ancestry, and which were set forth in\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, they made common cause with their\r\nneighbors, and may, at least, claim to have done their full share in the\r\nwar that ensued.\r\n\r\nBy the exclusion of the South, in 1820, from all that part of the\r\nLouisiana purchase lying north of the parallel of thirty-six degrees\r\nthirty minutes, and not included in the State of Missouri, by the\r\nextension of that line of exclusion to embrace the territory acquired\r\nfrom Texas; and by the appropriation of _all_ the territory obtained\r\nfrom Mexico under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, both north and south\r\nof that line, it may be stated with approximate accuracy that the North\r\nhad monopolized to herself more than three fourths of all that had been\r\nadded to the domain of the United States since the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. This inequality, which began, as has been shown, in the\r\nmore generous than wise confidence of the South, was employed to obtain\r\nfor the North the lion's share of what was afterward added at the cost\r\nof the public treasure and the blood of patriots. I do not care to\r\nestimate the relative proportion contributed by each of the two\r\nsections.\r\n\r\nNor was this the only cause that operated to disappoint the reasonable\r\nhopes and to blight the fair prospects under which the original compact\r\nwas formed. The effects of discriminating duties upon imports have been\r\nreferred to in a former chapter--favoring the manufacturing region,\r\nwhich was the North; burdening the exporting region, which was the\r\nSouth; and so imposing upon the latter a double tax: one, by the\r\nincreased price of articles of consumption, which, so far as they were\r\nof home production, went into the pockets of the manufacturer; the\r\nother, by the diminished value of articles of export, which was so much\r\nwithheld from the pockets of the agriculturist. In like manner the power\r\nof the majority section was employed to appropriate to itself an unequal\r\nshare of the public disbursements. These combined causes--the possession\r\nof more territory, more money, and a wider field for the employment of\r\nspecial labor--all served to attract immigration; and, with increasing\r\npopulation, the greed grew by what it fed on.\r\n\r\nThis became distinctly manifest when the so-called \"Republican\"\r\nConvention assembled in Chicago, on May 16, 1860, to nominate a\r\ncandidate for the Presidency. It was a purely sectional body. There were\r\na few delegates present, representing an insignificant minority in the\r\n\"border States,\" Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri;\r\nbut not one from any State south of the celebrated political line of\r\nthirty-six degrees thirty minutes. It had been the invariable usage with\r\nnominating conventions of all parties to select candidates for the\r\nPresidency and Vice-Presidency, one from the North and the other from\r\nthe South; but this assemblage nominated Mr. Lincoln, of Illinois, for\r\nthe first office, and for the second, Mr. Hamlin, of Maine--both\r\nNortherners. Mr. Lincoln, its nominee for the Presidency, had publicly\r\nannounced that the Union \"could not permanently endure, half slave and\r\nhalf free.\" The resolutions adopted contained some carefully worded\r\ndeclarations, well adapted to deceive the credulous who were opposed to\r\nhostile aggressions upon the rights of the States. In order to\r\naccomplish this purpose, they were compelled to create a fictitious\r\nissue, in denouncing what they described as \"the new dogma that the\r\nConstitution, of its own force, carries slavery into any or all of the\r\nTerritories of the United States\"--a \"dogma\" which had never been held\r\nor declared by anybody, and which had no existence outside of their own\r\nassertion. There was enough in connection with the nomination to assure\r\nthe most fanatical foes of the Constitution that their ideas would be\r\nthe rule and guide of the party.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the Democratic party had held a convention, composed as usual\r\nof delegates from all the States. They met in Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, on April 23d, but an unfortunate disagreement with regard to\r\nthe declaration of principles to be set forth rendered a nomination\r\nimpracticable. Both divisions of the Convention adjourned, and met again\r\nin Baltimore in June. Then, having finally failed to come to an\r\nagreement, they separated and made their respective nominations apart.\r\nMr. Douglas, of Illinois, was nominated by the friends of the doctrine\r\nof \"popular sovereignty,\" with Mr. Fitzpatrick, of Alabama, for the\r\nVice-Presidency. Both these gentlemen at that time were Senators from\r\ntheir respective States. Mr. Fitzpatrick promptly declined the\r\nnomination, and his place was filled with the name of Mr. Herschel V.\r\nJohnson, a distinguished citizen of Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe Convention representing the conservative, or State-Rights, wing of\r\nthe Democratic-party (the President of which was the Hon. Caleb Cushing,\r\nof Massachusetts), on the first ballot, unanimously made choice of John\r\nC. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, then Vice-President of the United States,\r\nfor the first office, and with like unanimity selected General Joseph\r\nLane, then a Senator from Oregon, for the second. The resolutions of\r\neach of these two conventions denounced the action and policy of the\r\nAbolition party, as subversive of the Constitution, and revolutionary in\r\ntheir tendency.\r\n\r\nAnother convention was held in Baltimore about the same period[17] by\r\nthose who still adhered to the old Whig party, reënforced by the remains\r\nof the \"American\" organization, and perhaps some others. This Convention\r\nalso consisted of delegates from all the States, and, repudiating all\r\ngeographical and sectional issues, and declaring it to be \"both the part\r\nof patriotism and of duty to recognize no political principle other than\r\nthe Constitution of the country, the Union of the States, and the\r\nenforcement of the laws,\" pledged itself and its supporters \"to\r\nmaintain, protect, and defend, separately and unitedly, those great\r\nprinciples of public liberty and national safety against all enemies at\r\nhome and abroad.\" Its nominees were Messrs. John Bell, of Tennessee, and\r\nEdward Everett, of Massachusetts, both of whom had long been\r\ndistinguished members of the Whig party.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States now had four rival tickets presented to\r\nthem by as many contending parties, whose respective position and\r\nprinciples on the great and absorbing question at issue may be briefly\r\nrecapitulated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The \"Constitutional-Union\" Party, as it was now termed, led by\r\nMessrs. Bell and Everett, which ignored the territorial controversy\r\naltogether, and contented itself, as above stated, with a simple\r\ndeclaration of adherence to \"the Constitution, the Union, and the\r\nenforcement of the laws.\"\r\n\r\n2. The party of \"popular sovereignty,\" headed by Douglas and Johnson,\r\nwho affirmed the right of the people of the Territories, in their\r\nterritorial condition, to determine their own organic institutions,\r\nindependently of the control of Congress; denying the power or duty of\r\nCongress to protect the persons or property of individuals or minorities\r\nin such Territories against the action of majorities.\r\n\r\n3. The State-Rights party, supporting Breckinridge and Lane, who held\r\nthat the Territories were open to citizens of all the States, with their\r\nproperty, without any inequality or discrimination, and that it was the\r\nduty of the General Government to protect both persons and property from\r\naggression in the Territories subject to its control. At the same time\r\nthey admitted and asserted the right of the people of a Territory, on\r\nemerging from their territorial condition to that of a State, to\r\ndetermine what should then be their domestic institutions, as well as\r\nall other questions of personal or proprietary right, without\r\ninterference by Congress, and subject only to the limitations and\r\nrestrictions prescribed by the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n4. The so-called \"Republicans,\" presenting the names of Lincoln and\r\nHamlin, who held, in the language of one of their leaders,[18] that\r\n\"slavery can exist only by virtue of municipal law\"; that there was \"no\r\nlaw for it in the Territories, and no power to enact one\"; and that\r\nCongress was \"bound to prohibit it in or exclude it from any and every\r\nFederal Territory.\" In other words, they asserted the right and duty of\r\nCongress to exclude the citizens of half the States of the Union from\r\nthe territory belonging in common to all, unless on condition of the\r\nsacrifice or abandonment of their property recognized by the\r\nConstitution--indeed, of the _only_ species of their property distinctly\r\nand specifically recognized as such by that instrument.\r\n\r\nOn the vital question underlying the whole controversy--that is, whether\r\nthe Federal Government should be a Government of the whole for the\r\nbenefit of all its equal members, or (if it should continue to exist at\r\nall) a sectional Government for the benefit of a part--the first three\r\nof the parties above described were in substantial accord as against the\r\nfourth. If they could or would have acted unitedly, they, could\r\ncertainly have carried the election, and averted the catastrophe which\r\nfollowed. Nor were efforts wanting to effect such a union.\r\n\r\nMr. Bell, the Whig candidate, was a highly respectable and experienced\r\nstatesman, who had filled many important offices, both State and\r\nFederal. He was not ambitious to the extent of coveting the Presidency,\r\nand he was profoundly impressed by the danger which threatened the\r\ncountry. Mr. Breckinridge had not anticipated, and it may safely be said\r\ndid not eagerly desire, the nomination. He was young enough to wait, and\r\npatriotic enough to be willing to do so, if the weal of the country\r\nrequired it. Thus much I may confidently assert of both those gentlemen;\r\nfor each of them authorized me to say that he was willing to withdraw,\r\nif an arrangement could be effected by which the divided forces of the\r\nfriends of the Constitution could be concentrated upon some one more\r\ngenerally acceptable than either of the three who had been presented to\r\nthe country. When I made this announcement to Mr. Douglas--with whom my\r\nrelations had always been such as to authorize the assurance that he\r\ncould not consider it as made in an unfriendly spirit--he replied that\r\nthe scheme proposed was impracticable, because his friends, mainly\r\nNorthern Democrats, if he were withdrawn, would join in the support of\r\nMr. Lincoln, rather than of any one that should supplant _him_\r\n(Douglas); that he was in the hands of his friends, and was sure they\r\nwould not accept the proposition.\r\n\r\nIt needed but little knowledge of the _status_ of parties in the several\r\nStates to foresee a probable defeat if the conservatives were to\r\ncontinue divided into three parts, and the aggressives were to be held\r\nin solid column. But angry passions, which are always bad counselors,\r\nhad been aroused, and hopes were still cherished, which proved to be\r\nillusory. The result was the election, by a minority, of a President\r\nwhose avowed principles were necessarily fatal to the harmony of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nOf 303 _electoral_ votes, Mr. Lincoln received 180, but of the _popular_\r\nsuffrage of 4,676,853 votes, which the electors represented, he obtained\r\nonly 1,866,352--something over a third of the votes. This discrepancy\r\nwas owing to the system of voting by \"general ticket\"--that is, casting\r\nthe State votes as a unit, whether unanimous or nearly equally divided.\r\nThus, in New York, the total popular vote was 675,156, of which 362,646\r\nwere cast for the so-called Republican (or Lincoln) electors, and\r\n312,510 against them. Now York was entitled to 35 electoral votes.\r\nDivided on the basis of the popular vote, 19 of these would have been\r\ncast for Mr. Lincoln, and 16 against him. But under the \"general ticket\"\r\nsystem the entire 35 votes were cast for the Republican candidates, thus\r\ngiving them not only the full strength of the majority in their favor,\r\nbut that of the great minority against them superadded. So of other\r\nNorthern States, in which the small majorities on one side operated with\r\nthe weight of entire unanimity, while the virtual unanimity in the\r\nSouthern States, on the other side, counted nothing more than a mere\r\nmajority would have done.\r\n\r\nThe manifestations which followed this result, in the Southern States,\r\ndid not proceed, as has been unjustly charged, from chagrin at their\r\ndefeat in the election, or from any personal hostility to the\r\nPresident-elect, but from the fact that they recognized in him the\r\nrepresentative of a party professing principles destructive to \"their\r\npeace, their prosperity, and their domestic tranquillity.\" The\r\nlong-suppressed fire burst into frequent flame, but it was still\r\ncontrolled by that love of the Union which the South had illustrated in\r\nevery battle-field, from Boston to New Orleans. Still it was hoped,\r\nagainst hope, that some adjustment might be made to avert the calamities\r\nof a practical application of the theory of an \"irrepressible conflict.\"\r\nFew, if any, then doubted the right of a State to withdraw its grants\r\ndelegated to the Federal Government, or, in other words, to secede from\r\nthe Union; but in the South this was generally regarded as the remedy of\r\nlast resort, to be applied only when ruin or dishonor was the\r\nalternative. No rash or revolutionary action was taken by the Southern\r\nStates, but the measures adopted were considerate, and executed\r\nadvisedly and deliberately. The Presidential election occurred (as far\r\nas the popular vote, which determined the result, was concerned) in\r\nNovember, 1860. Most of the State Legislatures convened soon afterward\r\nin regular session. In some cases special sessions were convoked for the\r\npurpose of calling State Conventions--the recognized representatives of\r\nthe sovereign will of the people--to be elected expressly for the\r\npurpose of taking such action as should be considered needful and proper\r\nunder the existing circumstances.\r\n\r\nThese conventions, as it was always held and understood, possessed all\r\nthe power of the people assembled in mass; and therefore it was conceded\r\nthat they, and they only, could take action for the withdrawal of a\r\nState from the Union. The consent of the respective States to the\r\nformation of the Union had been given through such conventions, and it\r\nwas only by the same authority that it could properly be revoked. The\r\ntime required for this deliberate and formal process precludes the idea\r\nof hasty or passionate action, and none who admit the primary power of\r\nthe people to govern themselves can consistently deny its validity and\r\nbinding obligation upon every citizen of the several States. Not only\r\nwas there ample time for calm consideration among the people of the\r\nSouth, but for due reflection by the General Government and the people\r\nof the Northern States.\r\n\r\nPresident Buchanan was in the last year of his administration. His\r\nfreedom from sectional asperity, his long life in the public service,\r\nand his peace-loving and conciliatory character, were all guarantees\r\nagainst his precipitating a conflict between the Federal Government and\r\nany of the States; but the feeble power that he possessed in the closing\r\nmonths of his term to mold the policy of the future was painfully\r\nevident. Like all who had intelligently and impartially studied the\r\nhistory of the formation of the Constitution, he held that the Federal\r\nGovernment had no rightful power to coerce a State. Like the sages and\r\npatriots who had preceded him in the high office that he filled, he\r\nbelieved that \"our Union rests upon public opinion, and can never by\r\ncemented by the blood of its citizens shed in civil war. If it can not\r\nlive in the affections of the people, it must one day perish. Congress\r\nmay possess many means of preserving it by conciliation, but the sword\r\nwas not placed in their hand to preserve it by force.\"--(Message of\r\nDecember 3, 1860.)\r\n\r\nTen years before, Mr. Calhoun addressing the Senate with all the\r\nearnestness of his nature and with that sincere desire to avert the\r\ndanger of disunion which those who knew him best never doubted, had\r\nasked the emphatic question, \"How can the Union be saved?\" He answered\r\nhis question thus:\r\n\r\n    \"There is but one way by which it can be [saved] with any\r\n    certainty; and that is by a full and final settlement, on the\r\n    principles of justice, of all the questions at issue between the\r\n    sections. The South asks for justice--simple justice--and less\r\n    she ought not to take. She has no compromise to offer but the\r\n    Constitution, and no concession or surrender to make....\r\n\r\n    \"Can this be done? Yes, easily! Not by the weaker party; for it\r\n    can of itself do nothing--not even protect itself--but by the\r\n    stronger.... But will the North agree to do this? It is for her\r\n    to answer this question. But, I will say, she can not refuse if\r\n    she has half the love of the Union which she professes to have,\r\n    nor without exposing herself to the charge that her love of\r\n    power and aggrandizement is far greater than her love of the\r\n    Union.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the ten years that intervened between the date of this speech and\r\nthe message of Mr. Buchanan cited above, the progress of sectional\r\ndiscord and the tendency of the stronger section to unconstitutional\r\naggression had been fearfully rapid. With very rare exceptions, there\r\nwere none in 1850 who claimed the right of the Federal Government to\r\napply coercion to a State. In 1860 men had grown to be familiar with\r\nthreats of driving the South into submission to any act that the\r\nGovernment, in the hands of a Northern majority, might see fit to\r\nperform. During the canvass of that year, demonstrations had been made\r\nby _quasi_-military organizations in various parts of the North, which\r\nlooked unmistakably to purposes widely different from those enunciated\r\nin the preamble to the Constitution, and to the employment of means not\r\nauthorized by the powers which the States had delegated to the Federal\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nWell-informed men still remembered that, in the Convention which framed\r\nthe Constitution, a proposition was made to authorize the employment of\r\nforce against a delinquent State, on which Mr. Madison remarked that\r\n\"the use of force against a State would look more like a declaration of\r\nwar than an infliction of punishment, and would probably be considered\r\nby the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which\r\nit might have been bound.\" The Convention expressly refused to confer\r\nthe power proposed, and the clause was lost. While, therefore, in 1860,\r\nmany violent men, appealing to passion and the lust of power, were\r\ninciting the multitude, and preparing Northern opinion to support a war\r\nwaged against the Southern States in the event of their secession, there\r\nwere others who took a different view of the case. Notable among such\r\nwas the \"New York Tribune,\" which had been the organ of the\r\nabolitionists, and which now declared that, \"if the cotton States wished\r\nto withdraw from the Union, they should be allowed to do so\"; that \"any\r\nattempt to compel them to remain, by force, would be contrary to the\r\nprinciples of the Declaration of Independence and to the fundamental\r\nideas upon which human liberty is based\"; and that, \"if the Declaration\r\nof Independence justified the secession from the British Empire of three\r\nmillions of subjects in 1776, it was not seen why it would not justify\r\nthe secession of five millions of Southerners from the Union in 1861.\"\r\nAgain, it was said by the same journal that, \"sooner than compromise\r\nwith the South and abandon the Chicago platform,\" they would \"let the\r\nUnion slide.\" Taunting expressions were freely used--as, for example,\r\n\"If the Southern people wish to leave the Union, we will do our best to\r\nforward their views.\"\r\n\r\nAll this, it must be admitted, was quite consistent with the\r\noft-repeated declaration that the Constitution was a \"covenant with\r\nhell,\" which stood as the caption of a leading abolitionist paper of\r\nBoston. That signs of coming danger so visible, evidences of hostility\r\nso unmistakable, disregard of constitutional obligations so wanton,\r\ntaunts and jeers so bitter and insulting, should serve to increase\r\nexcitement in the South, was a consequence flowing as much from reason\r\nand patriotism as from sentiment. He must have been ignorant of human\r\nnature who did not expect such a tree to bear fruits of discord and\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: May 19, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Horace Greeley, \"The American Conflict,\" vol. i, p. 322.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n    Conference with the Governor of Mississippi.--The Author\r\n    censured as \"too slow.\"--Summons to Washington.--Interview with\r\n    the President.--His Message.--Movements in Congress.--The\r\n    Triumphant Majority.--The Crittenden Proposition.--Speech of the\r\n    Author on Mr. Green's Resolution.--The Committee of\r\n    Thirteen.--Failure to agree.--The \"Republicans\" responsible for\r\n    the Failure.--Proceedings in the House of\r\n    Representatives.--Futility of Efforts for an Adjustment.--The\r\n    Old Year closes in Clouds.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November, 1860, after the result of the Presidential election was\r\nknown, the Governor of Mississippi, having issued his proclamation\r\nconvoking a special session of the Legislature to consider the propriety\r\nof calling a convention, invited the Senators and Representatives of the\r\nState in Congress, to meet him for consultation as to the character of\r\nthe message he should send to the Legislature when assembled.\r\n\r\nWhile holding, in common with my political associates, that the right of\r\na State to secede was unquestionable, I differed from most of them as to\r\nthe probability of our being permitted peaceably to exercise the right.\r\nThe knowledge acquired by the administration of the War Department for\r\nfour years, and by the chairmanship of the Military Committee of the\r\nSenate at two different periods, still longer in combined duration, had\r\nshown me the entire lack of preparation for war in the South. The\r\nfoundries and armories were in the Northern States, and there were\r\nstored all the new and improved weapons of war. In the arsenals of the\r\nSouthern States were to be found only arms of the old and rejected\r\nmodels. The South had no manufactories of powder, and no navy to protect\r\nour harbors, no merchant-ships for foreign commerce. It was evident to\r\nme, therefore, that, if we should be involved in war, the odds against\r\nus would be far greater than what was due merely to our inferiority in\r\npopulation. Believing that secession would be the precursor of war\r\nbetween the States, I was consequently slower and more reluctant than\r\nothers, who entertained a different opinion, to resort to that remedy.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in the consultation with the Governor just referred to, a\r\ntelegraphic message was handed to me from two members of Mr. Buchanan's\r\nCabinet, urging me to proceed \"immediately\" to Washington. This dispatch\r\nwas laid before the Governor and the members of Congress from the State\r\nwho were in conference with him, and it was decided that I should comply\r\nwith the summons. I was afterward informed that my associates considered\r\nme \"too slow,\" and they were probably correct in the belief that I was\r\nbehind the general opinion of the people of the State as to the\r\npropriety of prompt secession.[19]\r\n\r\nOn arrival at Washington, I found, as had been anticipated, that my\r\npresence there was desired on account of the influence which it was\r\nsupposed I might exercise with the President (Mr. Buchanan) in relation\r\nto his forthcoming message to Congress. On paying my respects to the\r\nPresident, he told me that he had finished the rough draft of his\r\nmessage, but that it was still open to revision and amendment, and that\r\nhe would like to read it to me. He did so, and very kindly accepted all\r\nthe modifications which I suggested. The message was, however, afterward\r\nsomewhat changed, and, with great deference to the wisdom and\r\nstatesmanship of its author, I must say that, in my judgment, the last\r\nalterations were unfortunate--so much so that, when it was read in the\r\nSenate, I was reluctantly constrained to criticise it. Compared,\r\nhowever, with documents of the same class which have since been\r\naddressed to the Congress of the United States, the reader of\r\nPresidential messages must regret that it was not accepted by Mr.\r\nBuchanan's successors as a model, and that his views of the Constitution\r\nhad not been adopted as a guide in the subsequent action of the Federal\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe popular movement in the South was tending steadily and rapidly\r\ntoward the secession of those known as \"planting States\"; yet, when\r\nCongress assembled on December 3, 1860 the representatives of the people\r\nof all those States took their seats in the House, and they were all\r\nrepresented in the Senate, except South Carolina, whose Senators had\r\ntendered their resignation to the Governor immediately on the\r\nannouncement of the result of the Presidential election. Hopes were\r\nstill cherished that the Northern leaders would appreciate the impending\r\nperil, would cease to treat the warnings, so often given, as idle\r\nthreats, would refrain from the bravado, so often and so unwisely\r\nindulged, of ability \"to whip the South\" in thirty, sixty, or ninety\r\ndays, and would address themselves to the more manly purpose of devising\r\nmeans to allay the indignation, and quiet the apprehensions, whether\r\nwell, founded or not, of their Southern brethren. But the debates of\r\nthat session manifest, on the contrary, the arrogance of a triumphant\r\nparty, and the determination to reap to the uttermost the full harvest\r\nof a party victory.\r\n\r\nMr. Crittenden, of Kentucky, the oldest and one of the most honored\r\nmembers of the Senate,[20] introduced into that body a joint resolution\r\nproposing certain amendments to the Constitution--among them the\r\nrestoration and incorporation into the Constitution of the geographical\r\nline of the Missouri Compromise, with other provisions, which it was\r\nhoped might be accepted as the basis for an adjustment of the\r\ndifficulties rapidly hurrying the Union to disruption. But the earnest\r\nappeals of that venerable statesman were unheeded by Senators of the\r\nso-called Republican party. Action upon his proposition was postponed\r\nfrom time to time, on one pretext or another, until the last day of the\r\nsession--when seven States had already withdrawn from the Union and\r\nestablished a confederation of their own--and it was then defeated by a\r\nmajority of one vote.[21]\r\n\r\nMeantime, among other propositions made in the Senate were two\r\nintroduced early in the session, which it may be proper specially to\r\nmention. One of these was a resolution offered by Mr. Powell, of\r\nKentucky, which, after some modification by amendment, when finally\r\nacted upon, had taken the following form:\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved_, That so much of the President's message as relates\r\n    to the present agitated and distracted condition of the country,\r\n    and the grievances between the slaveholding and the non-slave\r\n    holding States, be referred to a special committee of thirteen\r\n    members, and that said committee be instructed to inquire into\r\n    the present condition of the country, and report by bill or\r\n    otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nThe other was a resolution offered by Mr. Green, of Missouri, to the\r\nfollowing effect:\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved_, That the Committee on the Judiciary be instructed\r\n    to inquire into the propriety of providing by law for\r\n    establishing an armed police force at all necessary points along\r\n    the line separating the slaveholding States from the\r\n    non-slaveholding States, for the purpose of maintaining the\r\n    general peace between those States, of preventing the invasion\r\n   of one State by citizens of another, and also for the efficient\r\n    execution of the fugitive-slave laws.\"\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of these two resolutions I find, in the proceedings of\r\nthe Senate on December 10th, as reported in the \"Congressional Globe,\"\r\nsome remarks of my own, the reproduction of which will serve to exhibit\r\nmy position at that period--a position which has since been often\r\nmisrepresented:\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. President, if the political firmament seemed to me dark\r\n    before, there has been little in the discussion this morning to\r\n    cheer or illumine it. When the proposition of the Senator from\r\n    Kentucky was presented--not very hopeful of a good result--I was\r\n    yet willing to wait and see what developments it might produce.\r\n    This morning, for the first time, it has been considered; and\r\n    what of encouragement have we received? One Senator proposes, as\r\n    a cure for the public evil impending over us, to invest the\r\n    Federal Government with such physical power as properly belongs\r\n    to monarchy alone; another announces that his constituents cling\r\n    to the Federal Government, if its legislative favors and its\r\n    Treasury secure the works of improvement and the facilities\r\n    which they desire; while another rises to point out that the\r\n    evils of the land are of a party character. Sir, we have fallen\r\n    upon evil times indeed, if the great convulsion which now shakes\r\n    the body-politic to its center is to be dealt with by such\r\n    nostrums as these. Men must look more deeply, must rise to a\r\n    higher altitude; like patriots they must confront the danger\r\n    face to face, if they hope to relieve the evils which now\r\n    disturb the peace of the land, and threaten the destruction of\r\n    our political existence.\r\n\r\n    \"First of all, we must inquire what is the cause of the evils\r\n    which beset us? The diagnosis of the disease must be stated\r\n    before we are prepared to prescribe. Is it the fault of our\r\n    legislation here? If so, then it devolves upon us to correct it,\r\n    and we have the power. Is it the defect of the Federal\r\n    organization, of the fundamental law of our Union? I hold that\r\n    it is not. Our fathers, learning wisdom from the experiments of\r\n    Rome and of Greece--the one a consolidated republic, and the\r\n    other strictly a confederacy--and taught by the lessons of our\r\n    own experiment under the Confederation, came together to form a\r\n    Constitution for 'a more perfect union,' and, in my judgment,\r\n    made the best government which has ever been instituted by man.\r\n    It only requires that it should be carried out in the spirit in\r\n    which it was made, that the circumstances under which it was\r\n    made should continue, and no evil can arise under this\r\n    Government for which it has not an appropriate remedy. Then it\r\n    is outside of the Government--elsewhere than to its Constitution\r\n    or to its administration--that we are to look. Men must not\r\n    creep in the dust of partisan strife and seek to make points\r\n    against opponents as the means of evading or meeting the issues\r\n    before us. The fault is not in the form of the Government, nor\r\n    does the evil spring from the manner in which it has been\r\n    administered. Where, then, is it? It is that our fathers formed\r\n    a Government for a Union of friendly States; and though under it\r\n    the people have been prosperous beyond comparison with any other\r\n    whose career is recorded in the history of man, still that Union\r\n    of friendly States has changed its character, and sectional\r\n    hostility has been substituted for the fraternity in which the\r\n    Government was founded.\r\n\r\n    \"I do not intend here to enter into a statement of grievances; I\r\n    do not intend here to renew that war of crimination which for\r\n    years past has disturbed the country, and in which I have taken\r\n    a part perhaps more zealous than useful; but I call upon all men\r\n    who have in their hearts a love of the Union, and whose service\r\n    is not merely that of the lip, to look the question calmly but\r\n    fully in the face, that they may see the true cause of our\r\n    danger, which, from my examination, I believe to be that a\r\n    sectional hostility has been substituted for a general\r\n    fraternity, and thus the Government rendered powerless for the\r\n    ends for which it was instituted. The hearts of a portion of the\r\n    people have been perverted by that hostility, so that the powers\r\n    delegated by the compact of union are regarded not as means to\r\n    secure the welfare of all, but as instruments for the\r\n    destruction of a part--the minority section. How, then, have we\r\n    to provide a remedy? By strengthening this Government? By\r\n    instituting physical force to overawe the States, to coerce the\r\n    people living under them as members of sovereign communities to\r\n    pass under the yoke of the Federal Government? No, sir; I would\r\n    have this Union severed into thirty-three fragments sooner than\r\n    have that great evil befall constitutional liberty and\r\n    representative government. Our Government is an agency of\r\n    delegated and strictly limited powers. Its founders did not look\r\n    to its preservation by force; but the chain they wove to bind\r\n    these States together was one of love and mutual good offices.\r\n    They had broken the fetters of despotic power; they had\r\n    separated themselves from the mother-country upon the question\r\n    of community independence; and their sons will be degenerate\r\n    indeed if, clinging to the mere name and forms of free\r\n    government, they forge and rivet upon their posterity the\r\n    fetters which their ancestors broke....\r\n\r\n    \"The remedy for these evils is to be found in the patriotism and\r\n    the affection of the people, if it exists; and, if it does not\r\n    exist, it is far better, instead of attempting to preserve a\r\n    forced and therefore fruitless Union, that we should peacefully\r\n    part and each pursue his separate course. It is not to this side\r\n    of the Chamber that we should look for propositions; it is not\r\n    here that we can ask for remedies. Complaints, with much\r\n    amplitude of specification, have gone forth from the members on\r\n    this side of the Chamber heretofore. It is not to be expected\r\n    that they will be renewed, for the people have taken the subject\r\n    into their own hands. States, in their sovereign capacity, have\r\n    now resolved to judge of the infractions of the Federal compact,\r\n    and of the mode and measure of redress. All we can usefully or\r\n    properly do is to send to the people, thus preparing to act for\r\n    themselves, evidence of error, if error there be; to transmit to\r\n    them the proofs of kind feeling, if it actuates the Northern\r\n    section, where they now believe there is only hostility. If we\r\n    are mistaken as to your feelings and purposes, give a\r\n    substantial proof, that here may begin that circle which hence\r\n    may spread out and cover the whole land with proofs of\r\n    fraternity, of a reaction in public sentiment, and the assurance\r\n    of a future career in conformity with the principles and\r\n    purposes of the Constitution. All else is idle. I would not give\r\n    the parchment on which the bill would be written that is to\r\n    secure our constitutional rights within the limits of a State,\r\n    where the people are all opposed to the execution of that law.\r\n    It is a truism in free governments that laws rest upon public\r\n    opinion, and fall powerless before its determined opposition.\r\n\r\n    \"The time has passed, sir, when appeals might profitably be made\r\n    to sentiment. The time has come when men must of necessity\r\n    reason, assemble facts, and deal with current events. I may be\r\n    permitted in this to correct an error into which one of my\r\n    friends fell this morning, when he impressed on us the great\r\n    value of our Union as measured by the amount of time and money\r\n    and blood which were spent to form this Union. It cost very\r\n    little time, very little money, and no blood. It was one of the\r\n    most peaceful transactions that mark the pages of human history.\r\n    Our fathers fought the war of the Revolution to maintain the\r\n    rights asserted in their Declaration of Independence.\"\r\n\r\n    Mr. Powell: \"The Senator from Mississippi will allow me to say\r\n    that I spoke of the Government, not of the Union. I said time\r\n    and money and blood had been required to form the Government.\"\r\n\r\n    Mr. Davis: \"The Government is the machinery established by the\r\n    Constitution; it is the agency created by the States when they\r\n    formed the Union. Our fathers, I was proceeding to say, having\r\n    fought the war of the Revolution, and achieved their\r\n    independence--each State for itself, each State standing out an\r\n    integral part, each State separately recognized by the parent\r\n    Government of Great Britain--these States as independent\r\n    sovereignties entered into confederate alliance. After having\r\n    tried the Confederation and found it to be a failure, they, of\r\n    their own accord, came peacefully together, and in a brief\r\n    period made a Constitution, which was referred to each State and\r\n    voluntarily ratified by each State that entered the Union;\r\n    little time, little money, and no blood being expended to form\r\n    this Government, the machine for making the Union useful and\r\n    beneficial. Blood, much and precious, was expended to vindicate\r\n    and to establish community independence, and the great American\r\n    idea that all governments rest on the consent of the governed,\r\n    and that the people may at their will alter or abolish their\r\n    government, however or by whomsoever instituted.\r\n\r\n    \"But our existing Government is not the less sacred to me\r\n    because it was not sealed with blood. I honor it the more\r\n    because it was the free-will offering of men who chose to live\r\n    together. It rooted in fraternity, and fraternity supported its\r\n    trunk and all its branches. Every bud and leaflet depends\r\n    entirely on the nurture it receives from fraternity as the root\r\n    of the tree. When that is destroyed, the trunk decays, and the\r\n    branches wither, and the leaves fall; and the shade it was\r\n    designed to give has passed away for ever. I cling not merely to\r\n    the name and form, but to the spirit and purpose of the Union\r\n    which our fathers made. It was for domestic tranquillity; not to\r\n    organize within one State lawless bands to commit raids upon\r\n    another. It was to provide for the common defense; not to\r\n    disband armies and navies, lest they should serve the protection\r\n    of one section of the country better than another. It was to\r\n    bring the forces of all the States together to achieve a common\r\n    object, upholding each the other in amity, and united to repel\r\n    exterior force. All the custom-house obstructions existing\r\n    between the States were destroyed; the power to regulate\r\n    commerce transferred to the General Government. Every barrier to\r\n    the freest intercourse was swept away. Under the Confederation\r\n    it had been secured as a right to each citizen to have free\r\n    transit over all the other States; and under the Union it was\r\n    designed to make this more perfect. Is it enjoyed? Is it not\r\n    denied? Do we not have mere speculative question of what is\r\n    property raised in defiance of the clear intent of the\r\n    Constitution, offending as well against its letter as against\r\n    its whole spirit? This must be reformed, or the Government our\r\n    fathers instituted is destroyed. I say, then, shall we cling to\r\n    the mere forms or idolize the name of Union, when its blessings\r\n    are lost, after its spirit has fled? Who would keep a flower,\r\n    which had lost its beauty and its fragrance, and in their stead\r\n    had formed a seed-vessel containing the deadliest poison? Or, to\r\n    drop the figure, who would consent to remain in alliance with\r\n    States which used the power thus acquired to invade his\r\n    tranquillity, to impair his defense, to destroy his peace and\r\n    security? Any community would be stronger standing in an\r\n    isolated position, and using its revenues to maintain its own\r\n    physical force, than if allied with those who would thus war\r\n    upon its prosperity and domestic peace; and reason, pride,\r\n    self-interest, and the apprehension of secret, constant danger\r\n    would impel to separation.\r\n\r\n    \"I do not comprehend the policy of a Southern Senator who would\r\n    seek to change the whole form of our Government, and substitute\r\n    Federal force for State obligation and authority. Do we want a\r\n    new Government that is to overthrow the old? Do we wish to erect\r\n    a central Colossus, wielding at discretion the military arm, and\r\n    exercising military force over the people and the States? This\r\n    is not the Union to which we were invited; and so carefully was\r\n    this guarded that, when our fathers provided for using force to\r\n    put down insurrection, they required that the fact of the\r\n    insurrection should be communicated by the authorities of the\r\n    State before the President could interpose. When it was proposed\r\n    to give to Congress power to execute the laws against a\r\n    delinquent State, it was refused on the ground that that would\r\n    be making war on the States; and, though I know the good purpose\r\n    of my honorable friend from Missouri is only to give protection\r\n    to constitutional rights, I fear his proposition is to rear a\r\n    monster, which will break the feeble chain provided, and destroy\r\n    rights it was intended to guard. That military Government which\r\n    he is about to institute, by passing into hostile hands, becomes\r\n    a weapon for his destruction, not for his protection. All\r\n    dangers which we may be called upon to confront as independent\r\n    communities are light, in my estimation, compared with that\r\n    which would hang over us if this Federal Government had such\r\n    physical force; if its character was changed from a\r\n    representative agent of States to a central Government, with a\r\n    military power to be used at discretion against the States.\r\n    To-day it may be the idea that it will be used against some\r\n    State which nullifies the Constitution and the laws; some State\r\n    which passes laws to obstruct or repeal the laws of the United\r\n    States; some State which, in derogation of our rights of transit\r\n    under the Constitution, passes laws to punish a citizen found\r\n    there with property recognized by the Constitution of the United\r\n    States, but prohibited by the laws of that State.\r\n\r\n    \"But how long might it be before that same military force would\r\n    be turned against the minority section which had sought its\r\n    protection; and that minority thus become mere subjugated\r\n    provinces under the great military government that it had thus\r\n    contributed to establish? The minority, incapable of aggression,\r\n    is, of necessity, always on the defensive, and often the victim\r\n    of the desertion of its followers and the faithlessness of its\r\n    allies. It therefore must maintain, not destroy, barriers.\r\n\r\n    \"I do not know that I fully appreciate the purpose of my friend\r\n    from Missouri; whether, when he spoke of establishing military\r\n    posts along the borders of the States, and arming the Federal\r\n    Government with adequate physical power to enforce\r\n    constitutional rights (I suppose he meant obligations), he meant\r\n    to confer upon this Federal Government a power which it does not\r\n    now possess to coerce a State. If he did, then, in the language\r\n    of Mr. Madison, he is providing, not for a union of States, but\r\n    for the destruction of States; he is providing, under the name\r\n    of Union, to carry on a war against States; and I care not\r\n    whether it be against Massachusetts or Missouri, it is equally\r\n    objectionable to me; and I will resist it alike in the one case\r\n    and in the other, as subversive of the great principle on which\r\n    our Government rests; as a heresy to be confronted at its first\r\n    presentation, and put down there, lest it grow into proportions\r\n    which will render us powerless before it.\r\n\r\n    \"The theory of our Constitution, Mr. President, is one of peace,\r\n    of equality of sovereign States. It was made by States and made\r\n    for States; and for greater assurance they passed an amendment,\r\n    doing that which was necessarily implied by the nature of the\r\n    instrument, as it was a mere instrument of grants. But, in the\r\n    abundance of caution, they declared that everything which had\r\n    not been delegated was reserved to the States, or to the\r\n    people--that is, to the State governments as instituted by the\r\n    people of each State, or to the people in their sovereign\r\n    capacity.\r\n\r\n    \"I need not, then, go on to argue from the history and nature of\r\n    our Government that no power of coercion exists in it. It is\r\n    enough for me to demand the clause of the Constitution which\r\n    confers the power. If it is not there, the Government does not\r\n    possess it. That is the plain construction of the\r\n    Constitution--made plainer, if possible, by its amendment.\r\n\r\n    \"This Union is dear to me as a Union of fraternal States. It\r\n    would lose its value if I had to regard it as a Union held\r\n    together by physical force. I would be happy to know that every\r\n    State now felt that fraternity which made this Union possible;\r\n    and, if that evidence could go out, if evidence satisfactory to\r\n    the people of the South could be given that that feeling existed\r\n    in the hearts of the Northern people, you might burn your\r\n    statute-books and we would cling to the Union still. But it is\r\n    because of their conviction that hostility, and not fraternity,\r\n    now exists in the hearts of the people, that they are looking to\r\n    their reserved rights and to their independent powers for their\r\n    own protection. If there be any good, then, which we can do, it\r\n    is by sending evidence to them of that which I fear does not\r\n    exist--the purpose of your constituents to fulfill in the spirit\r\n    of justice and fraternity all their constitutional obligations.\r\n    If you can submit to them that evidence, I feel confidence that,\r\n    with the assurance that aggression is henceforth to cease, will\r\n    terminate all the measures for defense. Upon you of the majority\r\n    section it depends to restore peace and perpetuate the Union of\r\n    equal States; upon us of the minority section rests the duty to\r\n    maintain our equality and community rights; and the means in one\r\n    case or the other must be such as each can control.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution of Mr. Powell was eventually adopted on the 18th of\r\nDecember, and on the 20th the Committee was appointed, consisting of\r\nMessrs. Powell and Crittenden, of Kentucky; Hunter, of Virginia; Toombs,\r\nof Georgia; Davis, of Mississippi; Douglas, of Illinois; Bigler, of\r\nPennsylvania; Rice, of Minnesota; Collamer, of Vermont; Seward, of New\r\nYork; Wade, of Ohio; Doolittle, of Wisconsin; and Grimes, of Iowa. The\r\nfirst five of the list, as here enumerated, were Southern men; the next\r\nthree were Northern Democrats, or Conservatives; the last five, Northern\r\n\"Republicans,\" so called.\r\n\r\nThe supposition was that any measure agreed upon by the representatives\r\nof the three principal divisions of public opinion would be approved by\r\nthe Senate and afterward ratified by the House of Representatives. The\r\nCommittee therefore determined that a majority of each of its three\r\ndivisions should be required in order to the adoption of any proposition\r\npresented. The Southern members declared their readiness to accept any\r\nterms that would secure the honor of the Southern States and guarantee\r\ntheir future safety. The Northern Democrats and Mr. Crittenden generally\r\ncoöperated with the State-Rights Democrats of the South; but the\r\nso-called \"Republican\" Senators of the North rejected every proposition\r\nwhich it was hoped might satisfy the Southern people, and check the\r\nprogress of the secession movement. After fruitless efforts, continued\r\nfor some ten days, the Committee determined to report the journal of\r\ntheir proceedings, and announce their inability to attain any\r\nsatisfactory conclusion. This report was made on the 31st of\r\nDecember--the last day of that memorable and fateful year, 1860.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, on the floor of the Senate, Mr. Douglas, who had been a\r\nmember of the Committee, called upon the opposite side to state what\r\nthey were willing to do. He referred to the fact that they had rejected\r\nevery proposition that promised pacification; stated that Toombs, of\r\nGeorgia, and Davis, of Mississippi, as members of the Committee, had\r\nbeen willing to renew the Missouri Compromise, as a measure of\r\nconciliation, but had met no responsive willingness on the part of their\r\nassociates of the opposition; and he pressed the point that, as they had\r\nrejected every overture made by the friends of peace, it was now\r\nincumbent upon _them_ to make a positive and affirmative declaration of\r\ntheir purposes.\r\n\r\nMr. Seward, of New York, as we have seen, was a member of that\r\nCommittee--the man who, in 1858, had announced the \"irrepressible\r\nconflict,\" and who, in the same year, speaking of and for abolitionism,\r\nhad said: \"It has driven you back in California and in Kansas; it will\r\ninvade your soil.\" He was to be the Secretary of State in the incoming\r\nAdministration, and was very generally regarded as the \"power behind the\r\nthrone,\" greater than the throne itself. He was present in the Senate,\r\nbut made no response to Mr. Douglas's demand for a declaration of\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nMeantime the efforts for an adjustment made in the House of\r\nRepresentatives had been equally fruitless. Conspicuous among these\r\nefforts had been the appointment of a committee of thirty-three\r\nmembers--one from each State of the Union--charged with a duty similar\r\nto that imposed upon the Committee of Thirteen in the Senate, but they\r\nhad been alike unsuccessful in coming to any agreement. It is true that,\r\na few days afterward, they submitted a majority and two minority\r\nreports, and that the report of the majority was ultimately adopted by\r\nthe House; but, even if this action had been unanimous, and had been\r\ntaken in due time, it would have been practically futile on account of\r\nits absolute failure to provide or suggest any solution of the\r\nterritorial question, which was the vital point in controversy.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, then, that, under the shadow of the failure of every effort\r\nin Congress to find any common ground on which the sections could be\r\nrestored to amity, the close of the year should have been darkened by a\r\ncloud in the firmament, which had lost even the silver lining so long\r\nseen, or thought to be seen, by the hopeful.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: The following extract from a letter of the Hon. O. R.\r\nSingleton, then a Representative of Mississippi in the United States\r\nCongress, in regard to the subject treated, is herewith annexed:\r\n\r\n    \"Canton, Mississippi, _July 14, 1877_.\r\n\r\n    \"In 1860, about the time the ordinance of secession was passed\r\n    by the South Carolina Convention, and while Mississippi,\r\n    Alabama, and other Southern States were making active\r\n    preparations to follow her example, a conference of the\r\n    Mississippi delegation in Congress, Senators and\r\n    Representatives, was asked for by Governor J. J. Pettus, for\r\n    consultation as to the course Mississippi ought to take in the\r\n    premises.\r\n\r\n    \"The meeting took place in the fall of 1860, at Jackson, the\r\n    capital; the whole delegation being present, with perhaps the\r\n    exception of one Representative.\r\n\r\n    \"The main question for consideration was: 'Shall Mississippi, as\r\n    soon as her Convention can meet, pass an ordinance of secession,\r\n    thus placing herself by the side of South Carolina, regardless\r\n    of the action of other States; or shall she endeavor to hold\r\n    South Carolina in check, and delay action herself, until other\r\n    States can get ready, through their conventions, to unite with\r\n    them, and then, on a given day and at a given hour, by concert\r\n    of action, all the States willing to do so, secede in a body?'\r\n\r\n    \"Upon the one side, it was argued that South Carolina could not\r\n    be induced to delay action a single moment beyond the meeting of\r\n    her Convention, and that our fate should be hers, and to delay\r\n    action would be to have her crushed by the Federal Government;\r\n    whereas, by the earliest action possible, we might be able to\r\n    avert this calamity. On the other side, it was contended that\r\n    delay might bring the Federal Government to consider the\r\n    emergency of the case, and perhaps a compromise could be\r\n    effected; but, if not, then the proposed concert of action would\r\n    at least give dignity to the movement, and present an undivided\r\n    Southern front.\r\n\r\n    \"The debate lasted many hours, and Mr. Davis, with perhaps one\r\n    other gentleman in that conference, opposed immediate and\r\n    separate State action, declaring himself opposed to secession as\r\n    long as the hope of a peaceable remedy remained. He did not\r\n    believe we ought to precipitate the issue, as he felt certain\r\n    from his knowledge of the people, North and South, that, once\r\n    there was a clash of arms, the contest would be one of the most\r\n    sanguinary the world had ever witnessed.\r\n\r\n    \"A majority of the meeting decided that no delay should be\r\n    interposed to separate State action, Mr. Davis being on the\r\n    other side; but, after the vote was taken and the question\r\n    decided, Mr. Davis declared he would stand by whatever action\r\n    the Convention representing the sovereignty of the State of\r\n    Mississippi might think proper to take.\r\n\r\n    \"After the conference was ended, several of its members were\r\n    dissatisfied with the course of Mr. Davis, believing that he was\r\n    entirely opposed to secession, and was seeking to delay action\r\n    upon the part of Mississippi, with the hope that it might be\r\n    entirely averted.\r\n\r\n    \"In some unimportant respects my memory may be at fault, and\r\n    possibly some of the inferences drawn may be incorrect; but\r\n    every material statement made, I am sure, is true, and if need,\r\n    can be, easily substantiated by other persons.\r\n\r\n    \"Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\"\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"O. R. Singleton.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Mr. Crittenden had been a life-long Whig. His first\r\nentrance into the Senate was in 1817, and he was a member of that body\r\nat various periods during the ensuing forty-four years. He was\r\nAttorney-General in the Whig Cabinets of both General Harrison and Mr.\r\nFillmore, and supported the Bell and Everett ticket in 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: The vote was nineteen yeas to twenty nays; total,\r\nthirty-nine. As the consent of two thirds of each House is necessary to\r\npropose an amendment for action by the States, twenty-six of the votes\r\ncast in the Senate would have been necessary to sustain the proposition.\r\nIt actually failed, therefore, by _seven_ votes, instead of _one_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n    Preparations for withdrawal from the Union.--Northern\r\n    Precedents.--New England Secessionists.--Cabot, Pickering,\r\n    Quincy, etc.--On the Acquisition of Louisiana.--The Hartford\r\n    Convention.--The Massachusetts Legislature on the Annexation of\r\n    Texas, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Convention of South Carolina had already (on the 20th of December,\r\n1860) unanimously adopted an ordinance revoking her delegated powers and\r\nwithdrawing from the Union. Her representatives, on the following day,\r\nretired from their seats in Congress. The people of the other planting\r\nStates had been only waiting in the lingering hope that some action\r\nmight be taken by Congress to avert the necessity for action similar to\r\nthat of South Carolina. In view of the failure of all overtures for\r\nconciliation during the first month of the session, they were now making\r\ntheir final preparations for secession. This was generally admitted to\r\nbe an unquestionable right appertaining to their sovereignty as States,\r\nand the only _peaceable_ remedy that remained for the evils already felt\r\nand the dangers apprehended.\r\n\r\nIn the prior history of the country, repeated instances are found of the\r\nassertion of this right, and of a purpose entertained at various times\r\nto put it in execution. Notably is this true of Massachusetts and other\r\nNew England States. The acquisition of Louisiana, in 1803, had created\r\nmuch dissatisfaction in those States, for the reason, expressed by an\r\neminent citizen of Massachusetts,[22] that \"the influence of our [the\r\nNortheastern] part of the Union must be diminished by the acquisition of\r\nmore weight at the other extremity.\" The project of a separation was\r\nfreely discussed, with no intimation, in the records of the period, of\r\nany idea among its advocates that it could be regarded as treasonable or\r\nrevolutionary.\r\n\r\nColonel Timothy Pickering, who had been an officer of the war of the\r\nRevolution, afterward successively Postmaster-General, Secretary of War,\r\nand Secretary of State, in the Cabinet of General Washington, and, still\r\nlater, long a representative of the State of Massachusetts in the Senate\r\nof the United States, was one of the leading secessionists of his day.\r\nWriting from Washington to a friend, on the 24th of December, 1803, he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    \"I will not yet despair. I will rather anticipate a _new\r\n    confederacy_, exempt from the corrupt and corrupting influence\r\n    and oppression of the aristocratic democrats of the South. There\r\n    will be (and our children, at farthest, will see it) a\r\n    separation. The white and black population will mark the\r\n    boundary.\"[23]\r\n\r\nIn another letter, written a few weeks afterward (January 29, 1804),\r\nspeaking of what he regarded as wrongs and abuses perpetrated by the\r\nthen existing Administration, he thus expresses his views of the remedy\r\nto be applied:\r\n\r\n    \"The principles of our Revolution point to the remedy--_a\r\n    separation_. That this can be accomplished, and without spilling\r\n    one drop of blood, I have little doubt....\r\n\r\n    \"I do not believe in the practicability of a long-continued\r\n    Union. A _Northern Confederacy_ would unite congenial characters\r\n    and present a fairer prospect of public happiness; while the\r\n    Southern States, having a similarity of habits, might be left to\r\n    'manage their own affairs in their own way.' If a separation\r\n    were to take place, our mutual wants would render a friendly and\r\n    commercial intercourse inevitable. The Southern States would\r\n    require the naval protection of the _Northern Union_, and the\r\n    products of the former would be important to the navigation and\r\n    commerce of the latter....\r\n\r\n    \"It [the separation] must begin, in Massachusetts. The\r\n    proposition would be welcomed in Connecticut; and could we doubt\r\n    of New Hampshire? But New York must be associated; and how is\r\n    her concurrence to be obtained? She must be made the center of\r\n    the Confederacy. Vermont and New Jersey would follow of course,\r\n    and Rhode Island of necessity.\"[24]\r\n\r\nSubstituting South Carolina for Massachusetts; Virginia for New York;\r\nGeorgia, Mississippi, and Alabama, for New Hampshire, Vermont, and Rhode\r\nIsland; Kentucky for New Jersey, etc., etc., we find the suggestions of\r\n1860-'61 only a reproduction of those thus outlined nearly sixty years\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickering seems to have had a correct and intelligent perception of\r\nthe altogether pacific character of the secession which he proposed, and\r\nof the mutual advantages likely to accrue to both sections from a\r\npeaceable separation. Writing in February, 1804, he explicitly disavows\r\nthe idea of hostile feeling or action toward the South, expressing\r\nhimself as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"While thus contemplating the only means of maintaining our\r\n    ancient institutions in morals and religion, and our equal rights,\r\n    we wish no ill to the Southern States and those naturally connected\r\n    with them. The public debts might be equitably apportioned\r\n    between the new confederacies, and a separation somewhere\r\n    about the line above suggested would divide the different characters\r\n    of the existing Union. The manners of the Eastern portion\r\n    of the States would be sufficiently congenial to form a Union, and\r\n    their interests are alike intimately connected with agriculture and\r\n    commerce. A friendly and commercial intercourse would be maintained\r\n    with the States in the Southern Confederacy as at present.\r\n    Thus all the advantages which have been for a few years depending\r\n    on the general Union would be continued to its respective portions,\r\n    without the jealousies and enmities which now afflict both,\r\n    and which peculiarly embitter the condition of that of the North.\r\n    It is not unusual for two friends, when disagreeing about the mode\r\n    of conducting a common concern, to separate and manage, each in\r\n    his own way, his separate interest, and thereby preserve a useful\r\n    friendship, which without such separation would infallibly be\r\n    destroyed.\"[25]\r\n\r\nSuch were the views of an undoubted patriot who had participated in the\r\nformation of the Union, and who had long been confidentially associated\r\nwith Washington in the administration of its Government, looking at the\r\nsubject from a Northern standpoint, within fifteen years after the\r\norganization of that Government under the Constitution. Whether his\r\nreasons for advocating a dissolution of the Union were valid and\r\nsufficient, or not, is another question which it is not necessary to\r\ndiscuss. His authority is cited only as showing the opinion prevailing\r\nin the North at that day with regard to the _right_ of secession from\r\nthe Union, if deemed advisable by the ultimate and irreversible judgment\r\nof the people of a sovereign State.\r\n\r\nIn 1811, on the bill for the admission of Louisiana as a State of the\r\nUnion, the Hon. Josiah Quincy, a member of Congress from Massachusetts,\r\nsaid\r\n\r\n    \"If this bill passes, it is my deliberate opinion that it is\r\n    virtually a dissolution of this Union; that it will free the\r\n    States from their moral obligation; and as it will be the right\r\n    of all, so it will be the duty of some, definitely to prepare\r\n    for a separation--amicably if they can, violently if they must.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Poindexter, delegate from what was then the Mississippi Territory,\r\ntook exception to these expressions of Mr. Quincy, and called him to\r\norder. The Speaker (Mr. Varnum, of Massachusetts) sustained Mr.\r\nPoindexter, and decided that the suggestion of a dissolution of the\r\nUnion was out of order. An appeal was taken from this decision, _and it\r\nwas reversed_. Mr. Quincy proceeded to vindicate the propriety of his\r\nposition in a speech of some length, in the course of which he said:\r\n\r\n    \"Is there a principle of public law better settled or more\r\n    conformable to the plainest suggestions of reason than that the\r\n    violation of a contract by one of the parties may be considered\r\n    as exempting the other from its obligations? Suppose, in private\r\n    life, thirteen form a partnership, and ten of them undertake to\r\n    admit a new partner without the concurrence of the other three;\r\n    would it not be at their option to abandon the partnership after\r\n    so palpable an infringement of their rights? How much more in\r\n    the political partnership, where the admission of new\r\n    associates, without previous authority, is so pregnant with\r\n    obvious dangers and evils!\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that these men--Cabot, Pickering. Quincy, and\r\nothers--whose opinions and expressions have been cited, were not\r\nDemocrats, misled by extreme theories of State rights, but leaders and\r\nexpositors of the highest type of \"Federalism, and of a strong central\r\nGovernment.\" This fact gives their support of the right of secession the\r\ngreater significance.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Hartford Convention assembled in December, 1814. It\r\nconsisted of delegates chosen by the Legislatures of Massachusetts,\r\nRhode Island, and Connecticut, with an irregular or imperfect\r\nrepresentation from the other two New England States, New Hampshire and\r\nVermont,[26] convened for the purpose of considering the grievances\r\ncomplained of by those States in connection with the war with Great\r\nBritain. They sat with closed doors, and the character of their\r\ndeliberations and discussions has not been authentically disclosed. It\r\nwas generally understood, however, that the chief subject of their\r\nconsiderations was the question of the withdrawal of the States they\r\nrepresented from the Union. The decision, as announced in their\r\npublished report, was adverse to the expediency of such a measure at\r\nthat time, and under the then existing conditions; but they proceeded to\r\nindicate the circumstances in which a dissolution of the Union might\r\nbecome expedient, and the mode in which it should be effected; and their\r\ntheoretical plan of separation corresponds very nearly with that\r\nactually adopted by the Southern States nearly fifty years afterward.\r\nThey say:\r\n\r\n    \"If the Union be destined to dissolution by reason of the\r\n    multiplied abuses of bad administration, it should, if possible,\r\n    be the work of peaceable times and deliberate consent. Some _new\r\n    form of confederacy_ should be substituted among those States\r\n    which shall intend to maintain a federal relation to each other.\r\n    Events may prove that the causes of our calamities are deep and\r\n    permanent. They may be found to proceed, not merely from the\r\n    blindness of prejudice, pride of opinion, violence of party\r\n    spirit, or the confusion of the times; but they may be traced to\r\n    implacable combinations of individuals or of States to\r\n    monopolize power and office, and to trample without remorse upon\r\n    the rights and interests of commercial sections of the Union.\r\n    Whenever it shall appear that the causes are radical and\r\n    permanent, a separation by equitable arrangement will be\r\n    preferable to an alliance by constraint among nominal friends,\r\n    but real enemies.\"\r\n\r\nThe omission of the single word \"commercial,\" which does not affect the\r\nprinciple involved, is the only modification necessary to adapt this\r\nextract exactly to the condition of the Southern States in 1860-'61.\r\n\r\nThe obloquy which has attached to the members of the Hartford Convention\r\nhas resulted partly from a want of exact knowledge of their proceedings,\r\npartly from the secrecy by which they were veiled, but mainly because it\r\nwas a recognized effort to paralyze the arm of the Federal Government\r\nwhile engaged in a war arising from outrages committed upon American\r\nseamen on the decks of American ships. The indignation felt was no doubt\r\naggravated by the fact that those ships belonged in a great extent to\r\nthe people who were now plotting against the war-measures of the\r\nGovernment, and indirectly, if not directly, giving aid and comfort to\r\nthe public enemy. Time, which has mollified passion, and revealed many\r\nthings not then known, has largely modified the first judgment passed on\r\nthe proceedings and purposes of the Hartford Convention; and, but for\r\nthe circumstances of existing war which surrounded it, they might have\r\nbeen viewed as political opinions merely, and have received\r\njustification instead of censure.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1844-'45 the measures taken for the annexation of Texas evoked\r\nremonstrances, accompanied by threats of a dissolution of the Union from\r\nthe Northeastern States. The Legislature of Massachusetts, in 1844,\r\nadopted a resolution, declaring, in behalf of that State, that \"the\r\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, faithful to the compact between the\r\npeople of the United States, according to the plain meaning and intent\r\nin which it was understood by them, is sincerely anxious for its\r\npreservation; but that it is determined, as it doubts not the other\r\nStates are, _to submit to undelegated powers in no body of men on\r\nearth_\"; and that \"the project of the annexation of Texas, unless\r\narrested on the threshold, _may tend to drive these States into a\r\ndissolution of the Union_.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the next year (February 11, 1845), the same Legislature adopted\r\nand communicated to Congress a series of resolutions on the same\r\nsubject, in one of which it was declared that, \"as the powers of\r\nlegislation granted in the Constitution of the United States to Congress\r\ndo not embrace a case of the admission of a foreign state or foreign\r\nterritory, by legislation, into the Union, such an act of admission\r\nwould have _no binding force whatever on the people of Massachusetts_\"--\r\nlanguage which must have meant that the admission of Texas would be a\r\njustifiable ground for secession, unless it was intended to announce the\r\npurpose of nullification.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that the people of the South, in the crisis\r\nwhich confronted them in 1860, had no lack either of precept or of\r\nprecedent for their instruction and guidance in the teaching and the\r\nexample of our brethren of the North and East. The only practical\r\ndifference was, that the North threatened and the South acted.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: George Cabot, who had been United States Senator from\r\nMassachusetts for several years during the Administration of\r\nWashington.--(See \"Life of Cabot,\" by Lodge, p. 334.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: See \"Life of Cabot,\" p. 491; letter of Pickering to\r\nHigginson.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Pickering to Cabot, \"Life of Cabot,\" pp. 338-340.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Letter to Theodore Lyman, \"Life of Cabot,\" pp. 445, 446.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Maine was not then a State.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n    False Statements of the Grounds for Separation.--Slavery not the\r\n    Cause, but an Incident.--The Southern People not \"Propagandists\"\r\n    of Slavery.--Early Accord among the States with regard to\r\n    African Servitude.--Statement of the Supreme Court.--Guarantees\r\n    of the Constitution.--Disregard of Oaths.--Fugitives from\r\n    Service and the \"Personal Liberty Laws.\"--Equality in the\r\n    Territories the Paramount Question.--The Dred Scott\r\n    Case.--Disregard of the Decision of the Supreme\r\n    Court.--Culmination of Wrongs.--Despair of their\r\n    Redress.--Triumph of Sectionalism.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the period to which this review of events has advanced, one State had\r\nalready withdrawn from the Union. Seven or eight others were preparing\r\nto follow her example, and others yet were anxiously and doubtfully\r\ncontemplating the probably impending necessity of taking the same\r\naction. The efforts of Southern men in Congress, aided by the\r\ncoöperation of the Northern friends of the Constitution, had failed, by\r\nthe stubborn refusal of a haughty majority, controlled by \"radical\"\r\npurposes, to yield anything to the spirit of peace and conciliation.\r\nThis period, coinciding, as it happens, with the close of a calendar\r\nyear, affords a convenient point to pause for a brief recapitulation of\r\nthe causes which had led the Southern States into the attitude they then\r\nheld, and for a more full exposition of the constitutional questions\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nThe reader of many of the treatises on these events, which have been put\r\nforth as historical, if dependent upon such alone for information, might\r\nnaturally enough be led to the conclusion that the controversies which\r\narose between the States, and the war in which they culminated, were\r\ncaused by efforts on the one side to extend and perpetuate human\r\nslavery, and on the other to resist it and establish human liberty. The\r\nSouthern States and Southern people have been sedulously represented as\r\n\"propagandists\" of slavery, and the Northern as the defenders and\r\nchampions of universal freedom, and this view has been so arrogantly\r\nassumed, so dogmatically asserted, and so persistently reiterated, that\r\nits authors have, in many cases, perhaps, succeeded in bringing\r\nthemselves to believe it, as well as in impressing it widely upon the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe attentive reader of the preceding chapters--especially if he has\r\ncompared their statements with contemporaneous records and other\r\noriginal sources of information--will already have found evidence enough\r\nto enable him to discern the falsehood of these representations, and to\r\nperceive that, to whatever extent the question of slavery may have\r\nserved as an _occasion_, it was far from being the _cause_ of the\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nI have not attempted, and shall not permit myself to be drawn into any\r\ndiscussion of the merits or demerits of slavery as an ethical or even as\r\na political question. It would be foreign to my purpose, irrelevant to\r\nmy subject, and would only serve--as it has invariably served, in the\r\nhands of its agitators--to \"darken counsel\" and divert attention from\r\nthe genuine issues involved.\r\n\r\nAs a mere historical fact, we have seen that African servitude among\r\nus--confessedly the mildest and most humane of all institutions to which\r\nthe name \"slavery\" has ever been applied--existed in all the original\r\nStates, and that it was recognized and protected in the fourth article\r\nof the Constitution. Subsequently, for climatic, industrial, and\r\neconomical--not moral or sentimental--reasons, it was abolished in the\r\nNorthern, while it continued to exist in the Southern States. Men\r\ndiffered in their views as to the abstract question of its right or\r\nwrong, but for two generations after the Revolution there was no\r\ngeographical line of demarkation for such differences. The African\r\nslave-trade was carried on almost exclusively by New England merchants\r\nand Northern ships. Mr. Jefferson--a Southern man, the founder of the\r\nDemocratic party, and the vindicator of State rights--was in theory a\r\nconsistent enemy to every form of slavery. The Southern States took the\r\nlead in prohibiting the slave-trade, and, as we have seen, one of them\r\n(Georgia) was the first State to incorporate such a prohibition in her\r\norganic Constitution. Eleven years after the agitation on the Missouri\r\nquestion, when the subject first took a sectional shape, the abolition\r\nof slavery was proposed and earnestly debated in the Virginia\r\nLegislature, and its advocates were so near the accomplishment of their\r\npurpose, that a declaration in its favor was defeated only by a small\r\nmajority, and that on the ground of expediency. At a still later period,\r\nabolitionist lecturers and teachers were mobbed, assaulted, and\r\nthreatened with tar and feathers in New York, Pennsylvania,\r\nMassachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and other States. One of them\r\n(Lovejoy) was actually killed by a mob in Illinois as late as 1837.\r\n\r\nThese facts prove incontestably that the sectional hostility which\r\nexhibited itself in 1820, on the application of Missouri for admission\r\ninto the Union, which again broke out on the proposition for the\r\nannexation of Texas in 1844, and which reappeared after the Mexican war,\r\nnever again to be suppressed until its fell results had been fully\r\naccomplished, was not the consequence of any difference on the abstract\r\nquestion of slavery. It was the offspring of sectional rivalry and\r\npolitical ambition. It would have manifested itself just as certainly if\r\nslavery had existed in all the States, or if there had not been a negro\r\nin America. No such pretension was made in 1803 or 1811, when the\r\nLouisiana purchase, and afterward the admission into the Union of the\r\nState of that name, elicited threats of disunion from the\r\nrepresentatives of New England. The complaint was not of slavery, but of\r\n\"the acquisition of more weight at the other extremity\" of the Union. It\r\nwas not slavery that threatened a rupture in 1832, but the unjust and\r\nunequal operation of a protective tariff.\r\n\r\nIt happened, however, on all these occasions, that the line of\r\ndemarkation of sectional interests coincided exactly or very nearly with\r\nthat dividing the States in which negro servitude existed from those in\r\nwhich it had been abolished. It corresponded with the prediction of Mr.\r\nPickering, in 1803, that, in the separation certainly to come, \"the\r\nwhite and black population would mark the boundary\"--a prediction made\r\nwithout any reference to slavery as a source of dissension.\r\n\r\nOf course, the diversity of institutions contributed, in some minor\r\ndegree, to the conflict of interests. There is an action and reaction of\r\ncause and consequence, which limits and modifies any general statement\r\nof a political truth. I am stating general principles--not defining\r\nmodifications and exceptions with the precision of a mathematical\r\nproposition or a bill in chancery. The truth remains intact and\r\nincontrovertible, that the existence of African servitude was in no wise\r\nthe cause of the conflict, but only an incident. In the later\r\ncontroversies that arose, however, its effect in operating as a lever\r\nupon the passions, prejudices, or sympathies of mankind, was so potent\r\nthat it has been spread, like a thick cloud, over the whole horizon of\r\nhistoric truth.\r\n\r\nAs for the institution of negro servitude, it was a matter entirely\r\nsubject to the control of the States. No power was ever given to the\r\nGeneral Government to interfere with it, but an obligation was imposed\r\nto protect it. Its existence and validity were distinctly recognized by\r\nthe Constitution in at least three places:\r\n\r\nFirst, in that part of the second section of the first article which\r\nprescribes that \"representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned\r\namong the several States which may be included within this Union,\r\naccording to their respective members, which shall be determined by\r\nadding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to\r\nservice for a term of years, and, excluding Indians not taxed, three\r\nfifths of all other persons.\" \"_Other_ persons\" than \"_free_ persons\"\r\nand those \"bound to service for a term of years\" must, of course, have\r\nmeant those permanently bound to service.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it was recognized by the ninth section of the same article,\r\nwhich provided that \"the migration or importation of such persons as any\r\nof the States now existing shall think proper to admit shall not be\r\nprohibited by Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and\r\neight.\" This was a provision inserted for the protection of the\r\ninterests of the slave-trading New England States, forbidding any\r\nprohibition of the trade by Congress for twenty years, and thus\r\nvirtually giving sanction to the legitimacy of the demand which that\r\ntrade was prosecuted to supply, and which was its only object.\r\n\r\nAgain, and in the third place, it was specially recognized, and an\r\nobligation imposed upon every State, not only to refrain from\r\ninterfering with it in any other State, but in certain cases to aid in\r\nits enforcement, by that clause, or paragraph, of the second section of\r\nthe fourth article which provides as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws\r\n    thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law\r\n    or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor,\r\n    but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such\r\n    service or labor may be due.\"\r\n\r\nThe President and Vice-President of the United States, every Senator and\r\nRepresentative in Congress, the members of every State Legislature, and\r\n\"all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of\r\nthe several States,\" were required to take an oath (or affirmation) to\r\nsupport the Constitution containing these provisions. It is easy to\r\nunderstand how those who considered them in conflict with the \"higher\r\nlaw\" of religion or morality might refuse to take such an oath or hold\r\nsuch an office--as the members of some religious sects refuse to take\r\nany oath at all or to bear arms in the service of their country--but it\r\nis impossible to reconcile with the obligations of honor or honesty the\r\nconduct of those who, having taken such an oath, made use of the powers\r\nand opportunities of the offices held under its sanctions to nullify its\r\nobligations and neutralize its guarantees. The halls of Congress\r\nafforded the vantage-ground from which assaults were made upon these\r\nguarantees. The Legislatures of various Northern States enacted laws to\r\nhinder the execution of the provisions made for the rendition of\r\nfugitives from service; State officials lent their aid to the work of\r\nthwarting them; and city mobs assailed the officers engaged in the duty\r\nof enforcing them.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the provision of the Constitution above quoted, for the\r\nrestoration of fugitives from service or labor, my own view was, and is,\r\nthat it was not a proper subject for legislation by the Federal\r\nCongress, but that its enforcement should have been left to the\r\nrespective States, which, as parties to the compact of union, should\r\nhave been held accountable for its fulfillment. Such was actually the\r\ncase in the earlier and better days of the republic. No fugitive\r\nslave-law existed, or was required, for two years after the organization\r\nof the Federal Government, and, when one was then passed, it was merely\r\nas an incidental appendage to an act regulating the mode of rendition of\r\nfugitives from _justice_--not from service or labor.[27]\r\n\r\nIn 1850 a more elaborate law was enacted as part of the celebrated\r\ncompromise of that year. But the very fact that the Federal Government\r\nhad taken the matter into its own hands, and provided for its execution\r\nby its own officers, afforded a sort of pretext to those States which\r\nhad now become hostile to this provision of the Constitution, not only\r\nto stand aloof, but in some cases to adopt measures (generally known as\r\n\"personal liberty laws\") directly in conflict with the execution of the\r\nprovisions of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe preamble to the Constitution declared the object of its founders to\r\nbe, \"to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic\r\ntranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general\r\nwelfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our\r\nposterity.\" Now, however (in 1860), the people of a portion of the\r\nStates had assumed an attitude of avowed hostility, not only to the\r\nprovisions of the Constitution itself, but to the \"domestic\r\ntranquillity\" of the people of other States. Long before the formation\r\nof the Constitution, one of the charges preferred in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence against the Government of Great Britain, as justifying the\r\nseparation of the colonies from that country, was that of having\r\n\"excited domestic insurrections among us.\" Now, the mails were burdened\r\nwith incendiary publications, secret emissaries had been sent, and in\r\none case an armed invasion of one of the States had taken place for the\r\nvery purpose of exciting \"domestic insurrection.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not the passage of the \"personal liberty laws,\" it was not the\r\ncirculation of incendiary documents, it was not the raid of John Brown,\r\nit was not the operation of unjust and unequal tariff laws, nor all\r\ncombined, that constituted the intolerable grievance, but it was the\r\nsystematic and persistent struggle to deprive the Southern States of\r\nequality in the Union--generally to discriminate in legislation against\r\nthe interests of their people; culminating in their exclusion from the\r\nTerritories, the common property of the States, as well as by the\r\ninfraction of their compact to promote domestic tranquillity.\r\n\r\nThe question with regard to the Territories has been discussed in the\r\nforegoing chapters, and the argument need not be repeated. There was,\r\nhowever, one feature of it which has not been specially noticed,\r\nalthough it occupied a large share of public attention at the time, and\r\nconstituted an important element in the case. This was the action of the\r\nFederal judiciary thereon, and the manner in which it was received.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 a case (the well-known \"Dred Scott case\") came before the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, involving the whole question of the\r\n_status_ of the African race and the rights of citizens of the Southern\r\nStates to migrate to the Territories, temporarily or permanently, with\r\ntheir slave property, on a footing of equality with the citizens of\r\nother States with _their_ property of any sort. This question, as we\r\nhave seen, had already been the subject of long and energetic\r\ndiscussion, without any satisfactory conclusion. All parties, however,\r\nhad united in declaring, that a decision by the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States--the highest judicial tribunal in the land--would be\r\naccepted as final. After long and patient consideration of the case, in\r\n1857, the decision of the Court was pronounced in an elaborate and\r\nexhaustive opinion, delivered by Chief-Justice Taney--a man eminent as a\r\nlawyer, great as a statesman, and stainless in his moral\r\nreputation--seven of the nine judges who composed the Court, concurring\r\nin it. The salient points established by this decision were:\r\n\r\n    1. That persons of the African race were not, and could not be,\r\n    acknowledged as \"part of the people,\" or citizens, under the\r\n    Constitution of the United States;\r\n\r\n    2. That Congress had no right to exclude citizens of the South\r\n    from taking their negro servants, as any other property, into\r\n    any part of the common territory, and that they were entitled to\r\n    claim its protection therein;\r\n\r\n    3. And, finally, as a consequence of the principle just above\r\n    stated, that the Missouri Compromise of 1820, in so far as it\r\n    prohibited the existence of African servitude north of a\r\n    designated line, was unconstitutional and void.[28] (It will be\r\n    remembered that it had already been declared \"inoperative and\r\n    void\" by the Kansas-Nebraska Bill of 1854.)\r\n\r\nInstead of accepting the decision of this then august tribunal--the\r\nultimate authority in the interpretation of constitutional questions--as\r\nconclusive of a controversy that had so long disturbed the peace and was\r\nthreatening the perpetuity of the Union, it was flouted, denounced, and\r\nutterly disregarded by the Northern agitators, and served only to\r\nstimulate the intensity of their sectional hostility.\r\n\r\nWhat resource for justice--what assurance of tranquillity--what\r\nguarantee of safety--now remained for the South? Still forbearing, still\r\nhoping, still striving for peace and union, we waited until a sectional\r\nPresident, nominated by a sectional convention, elected by a sectional\r\nvote--and that the vote of a minority of the people--was about to be\r\ninducted into office, under the warning of his own distinct announcement\r\nthat the Union could not permanently endure \"half slave and half free\";\r\nmeaning thereby that it could not continue to exist in the condition in\r\nwhich it was formed and its Constitution adopted. The leader of his\r\nparty, who was to be the chief of his Cabinet, was the man who had first\r\nproclaimed an \"irrepressible conflict\" between the North and the South,\r\nand who had declared that abolitionism, having triumphed in the\r\nTerritories, would proceed to the invasion of the States. Even then the\r\nSouthern people did not finally despair until the temper of the\r\ntriumphant party had been tested in Congress and found adverse to any\r\nterms of reconciliation consistent with the honor and safety of all\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nNo alternative remained except to seek the security out of the Union\r\nwhich they had vainly tried to obtain within it. The hope of our people\r\nmay be stated in a sentence. It was to escape from injury and strife in\r\nthe Union, to find prosperity and peace out of it. The mode and\r\nprinciples of their action will next be presented.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: \"There was but little necessity in those times, nor long\r\nafter, for an act of Congress to authorize the recovery of fugitive\r\nslaves. The laws of the free States and, still more, the force of public\r\nopinion were the owners' best safeguards. Public opinion was against the\r\nabduction of slaves; and, if any one was seduced from his owner, it was\r\ndone furtively and secretly, without show or force, and as any other\r\nmoral offense would be committed. State laws favored the owner, and to a\r\ngreater extent than the act of Congress did or could. In Pennsylvania\r\nthere was an act (it was passed in 1780, and only repealed in 1847)\r\ndiscriminating between the traveler and sojourner and the permanent\r\nresident, allowing the former to remain six months in the State before\r\nhis slaves would become subject to the emancipation laws; and, in the\r\ncase of a Federal officer, allowing as much more time as his duties\r\nrequired him to remain. New York had the same act, only varying in time,\r\nwhich was nine months. While these two acts were in force, and supported\r\nby public opinion, the traveler and sojourner was safe with his slaves\r\nin those States, and the same in the other free States. There was no\r\ntrouble about fugitive slaves in those times.\"--(Note to Benton's\r\n\"Abridgment of Debates,\" vol. i, p. 417.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: The Supreme Court of the United States in stating (through\r\nChief-Justice Taney) their decision in the \"Dred Scott case,\" in 1857,\r\nsay: \"In that portion of the United States where the labor of the negro\r\nrace was found to be unsuited to the climate and unprofitable to the\r\nmaster, but few slaves were held at the time of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence; and, when the Constitution was adopted, it had entirely\r\nworn out in one of them, and measures had been taken for its gradual\r\nabolition in several others. But this change had not been produced by\r\nany change of opinion in relation to this race, but because it was\r\ndiscovered from experience that slave-labor was unsuited to the climate\r\nand productions of these States; for some of these States, when it had\r\nceased, or nearly ceased, to exist, were actively engaged in the\r\nslave-trade; procuring cargoes on the coast of Africa, and transporting\r\nthem for sale to those parts of the Union where their labor was found to\r\nbe profitable and suited to the climate and productions. And this\r\ntraffic was openly carried on, and fortunes accumulated by it, without\r\nreproach from the people of the States where they resided.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement, it must be remembered, does not proceed from any\r\npartisan source, but is extracted from a judicial opinion pronounced by\r\nthe highest court in the country. In illustration of the truthfulness of\r\nthe latter part of it, may be mentioned the fact that a citizen of Rhode\r\nIsland (James D'Wolf), long and largely concerned in the slave-trade,\r\nwas sent from that State to the Senate of the United States as late as\r\nthe year 1821. In 1825 he resigned his seat in the Senate and removed to\r\nHavana, where he lived for many years, actively engaged in the same\r\npursuit, as president of a slave-trading company. The story is told of\r\nhim that, on being informed that the \"trade\" was to be declared piracy,\r\nhe smiled and said, \"So much the better for us--the Yankees will be the\r\nonly people not scared off by such a declaration.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n    The Original Confederation.--\"Articles of Confederation and\r\n    Perpetual Union.\"--Their Inadequacy ascertained.--Commercial\r\n    Difficulties.--The Conference at Annapolis.--Recommendation of a\r\n    General Convention.--Resolution of Congress.--Action of the\r\n    Several States.--Conclusions drawn therefrom.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen certain American colonies of Great Britain, each acting for itself,\r\nalthough in concert with the others, determined to dissolve their\r\npolitical connection with the mother-country, they sent their\r\nrepresentatives to a general Congress of those colonies, and through\r\nthem made a declaration that the Colonies were, and of right ought to\r\nbe, \"free and independent States.\" As such they contracted an alliance\r\nfor their \"common defense,\" successfully resisted the effort to reduce\r\nthem to submission, and secured the recognition by Great Britain of\r\ntheir separate independence; each State being distinctly recognized\r\nunder its own name--not as one of a group or nation. That this was not\r\nmerely a foreign view is evident from the second of the \"Articles of\r\nConfederation\" between the States, adopted subsequently to the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, which is in these words: \"Each State\r\nretains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power,\r\njurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly\r\ndelegated to the United States in Congress assembled.\"\r\n\r\nThese \"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union between the\r\nStates,\" as they were styled in their title, were adopted by eleven of\r\nthe original States in 1778, and by the other two in the course of the\r\nthree years next ensuing, and continued in force until 1789. During this\r\nperiod the General Government was vested in the Congress alone, in which\r\neach State, through its representatives, had an equal vote in the\r\ndetermination of all questions whatever. The Congress exercised all the\r\nexecutive as well as legislative powers delegated by the States. When\r\nnot in session the general management of affairs was intrusted to a\r\n\"Committee of the States,\" consisting of one delegate from each State.\r\nProvision was made for the creation, by the Congress, of courts having a\r\ncertain specified jurisdiction in admiralty and maritime cases, and for\r\nthe settlement of controversies between two or more States in a mode\r\nspecifically prescribed.\r\n\r\nThe Government thus constituted was found inadequate for some necessary\r\npurposes, and it became requisite to reorganize it. The first idea of\r\nsuch reorganization arose from the necessity of regulating the\r\ncommercial intercourse of the States with one another and with foreign\r\ncountries, and also of making some provision for payment of the debt\r\ncontracted during the war for independence. These exigencies led to a\r\nproposition for a meeting of commissioners from the various States to\r\nconsider the subject. Such a meeting was held at Annapolis in September,\r\n1786; but, as only five States (New York, New Jersey, Delaware,\r\nPennsylvania, and Virginia) were represented, the Commissioners declined\r\nto take any action further than to recommend another Convention, with a\r\nwider scope for consideration. As they expressed it, it was their\r\n\"unanimous conviction that it may essentially tend to advance the\r\ninterests of the Union, if the States, by whom they have been\r\nrespectively delegated, would themselves concur, and use their endeavors\r\nto procure the concurrence of the other States, in the appointment of\r\ncommissioners, to meet at Philadelphia on the second Monday in May next,\r\nto take into consideration the situation of the United States, to devise\r\nsuch further provisions as shall appear to them necessary to render the\r\nConstitution of the Federal Government adequate to the exigencies of the\r\nUnion, and to report such an act for that purpose to the United States\r\nin Congress assembled, as, when agreed to by them, and afterward\r\nconfirmed by the Legislatures of every State, will effectually provide\r\nfor the same.\"\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to remind the well-informed reader that the\r\nterms, \"Constitution of the Federal Government,\" employed above, and\r\n\"Federal Constitution,\" as used in other proceedings of that period, do\r\nnot mean the instrument to which we now apply them; and which was not\r\nthen in existence. They were applied to the system of government\r\nformulated in the Articles of Confederation. This is in strict accord\r\nwith the definition of the word constitution, given by an eminent\r\nlexicographer:[29] \"The body of fundamental laws, as contained in\r\nwritten documents or prescriptive usage, which constitute the form of\r\ngovernment for a nation, state, community, association, or society.\"[30]\r\nThus we speak of the British Constitution, which is an unwritten system\r\nof \"prescriptive usage\"; of the Constitution of Massachusetts or of\r\nMississippi, which is the fundamental or organic law of a particular\r\nState embodied in a written instrument; and of the Federal Constitution\r\nof the United States, which is the fundamental law of an association of\r\nStates, at first as embraced in the Articles of Confederation, and\r\nafterward as revised, amended, enlarged, and embodied in the instrument\r\nframed in 1787, and subsequently adopted by the various States. The\r\nmanner in which this revision was effected was as follows. Acting on the\r\nsuggestion of the Annapolis Convention, the Congress, on the 21st of the\r\nensuing February (1787), adopted the following resolution:\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved_, That, in the opinion of Congress, it is expedient\r\n    that, on the second Monday in May next, a convention of\r\n    delegates, who shall have been appointed by the several States,\r\n    be held at Philadelphia, for the sole and express purpose of\r\n    revising the Articles of Confederation, and reporting to\r\n    Congress and the several Legislatures, such alterations and\r\n    provisions therein as shall, when agreed to in Congress and\r\n    confirmed by the States, render the Federal Constitution\r\n    adequate to the exigencies of Government and the preservation of\r\n    the Union.\"\r\n\r\nThe language of this resolution, substantially according with that of\r\nthe recommendation made by the commissioners at Annapolis a few months\r\nbefore, very clearly defines the objects of the proposed Convention and\r\nthe powers which it was thought advisable that the States should confer\r\nupon their delegates. These were, \"solely and expressly,\" as follows:\r\n\r\n    1. \"To revise the Articles of Confederation with reference to\r\n    the 'situation of the United States';\r\n\r\n    2. \"To devise such alterations and provisions therein as should\r\n    seem to them requisite in order to render 'the Federal\r\n    Constitution,' or 'Constitution of the Federal Government,'\r\n    adequate to 'the exigencies of the Union,' or 'the exigencies of\r\n    the Government and the preservation of the Union';\r\n\r\n    3. \"To report the result of their deliberations--that is, the\r\n    'alterations and provisions' which they should agree to\r\n    recommend--to Congress and the Legislatures of the several\r\n    States.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, their action could be only advisory until ratified by the\r\nStates. The \"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union,\" under which\r\nthe States were already united, provided that no alteration should be\r\nmade in any of them, \"unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress\r\nof the United States, and afterward confirmed by the Legislatures of\r\nevery State.\"\r\n\r\nThe Legislatures of the various States, with the exception of Rhode\r\nIsland, adopted and proceeded to act upon these suggestions by the\r\nappointment of delegates--some of them immediately upon the\r\nrecommendation of the Annapolis Commissioners in advance of that of the\r\nCongress, and the others in the course of a few months after the\r\nresolution adopted by Congress. The instructions given to these\r\ndelegates in all cases conformed to the recommendations which have been\r\nquoted, and in one case imposed an additional restriction or limitation.\r\nAs this is a matter of much importance, in order to a right\r\nunderstanding of what follows, it may be advisable to cite in detail the\r\naction of the several States, italicizing such passages as are specially\r\nsignificant of the duties and powers of the delegates to the Convention.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly of Virginia, after reciting the recommendation made\r\nat Annapolis, enacted: \"That seven commissioners be appointed by joint\r\nballot of both Houses of Assembly, who, or any three of them, are hereby\r\nauthorized, as deputies from this Commonwealth, to meet such deputies as\r\nmay be appointed and authorized by other States, to assemble in\r\nconvention at Philadelphia, as above recommended, and to join with them\r\nin devising and discussing _all such alterations and further provisions\r\nas may be necessary to render the Federal Constitution adequate to the\r\nexigencies of the Union, and in reporting such an act for that purpose\r\nto the United States in Congress, as, when agreed to by them, and duly\r\nconfirmed by the several States_, will effectually provide for the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\nThe Council and Assembly of New Jersey issued commissions to their\r\ndelegates to meet such commissioners as have been, or may be, appointed\r\nby _the other States of the Union_, at the city of Philadelphia, in the\r\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, on the second Monday in May next, \"_for the\r\npurpose of taking into consideration the state of the Union as to trade\r\nand other important objects, and of devising such other provisions as\r\nshall appear to be necessary to render the Constitution of the Federal\r\nGovernment adequate to the exigencies thereof_.\"\r\n\r\nThe act of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania constituted and\r\nappointed certain deputies, designated by name, \"with powers to meet\r\nsuch deputies as may be _appointed and authorized by the other States_\r\n... and to join with them in devising, deliberating on, and discussing\r\n_all such alterations and further provisions_ as may be necessary _to\r\nrender the Federal Constitution fully adequate to the exigencies of the\r\nUnion_, and in reporting such act or acts for that purpose, to the\r\nUnited States in Congress assembled, as, _when agreed to by them and\r\nduly confirmed by the several States_, will effectually provide for the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly of North Carolina enacted that commissioners should\r\nbe appointed by joint ballot of both Houses, \"to meet and confer with\r\nsuch deputies as may be _appointed by the other States_ for similar\r\npurposes, and with them to discuss and decide upon _the most effectual\r\nmeans to remove the defects of our Federal Union, and to procure the\r\nenlarged purposes which it was intended to effect; and that they report\r\nsuch an act to the General Assembly of this State, as, when agreed to by\r\nthem_, will effectually provide for the same.\" (In the case of this\r\nState alone nothing is said of a report to Congress. Neither North\r\nCarolina nor any other State, however, fails to make mention of the\r\nnecessity of a submission of any action taken to the several States for\r\nratification.)\r\n\r\nThe commissions issued to the representatives of South Carolina, by the\r\nGovernor, refer to an act of the Legislature of that State authorizing\r\ntheir appointment \"to meet such deputies or commissioners as may be\r\n_appointed and authorized by other of the United States_,\" at the time\r\nand place designated, and to join with them \"in devising and discussing\r\nall _such alterations, clauses, articles, and provisions_, as may be\r\nthought necessary _to render the Federal Constitution entirely adequate_\r\nto the actual situation and future good government of the _Confederate\r\nStates_,\" and to \"join in reporting such an act to the United States in\r\nCongress assembled, as, _when approved and agreed to by them, and duly\r\nratified and confirmed by the several States_, will effectually provide\r\nfor the exigencies of the Union.\" In these commissions the expression,\r\n\"alterations, clauses, articles, and provisions,\" clearly indicates the\r\ncharacter of the duties which the deputies were expected to discharge.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly of Georgia \"ordained\" the appointment of certain\r\ncommissioners, specified by name, who were \"authorized, as deputies from\r\nthis State, to meet such deputies as may be _appointed and authorized by\r\nother States_, to assemble in convention at Philadelphia, and to join\r\nwith them in devising and discussing _all such alterations and further\r\nprovisions_ as may be necessary _to render the Federal Constitution\r\nadequate to the exigencies of the Union_, and in reporting such an act\r\nfor that purpose to the United States in Congress assembled, as, _when\r\nagreed to by them, and duly confirmed by the several States_, will\r\neffectually provide for the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe authority conferred upon their delegates by the Assembly of New York\r\nand the General Court of Massachusetts was in each case expressed in the\r\nexact words of the advisory resolution of Congress: they were instructed\r\nto meet the delegates of the other States \"for the sole and express\r\npurpose of _revising the Articles of Confederation_, and reporting to\r\nCongress and to the several Legislatures _such alterations and\r\nprovisions therein_ as shall, when agreed to in Congress, and confirmed\r\nby the several States, _render the Federal Constitution adequate to the\r\nexigencies of the Union_.\"\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly of Connecticut designated the delegates of that\r\nState by name, and empowered them, in conference with the delegates of\r\nother States, \"to discuss upon such alterations and provisions,\r\nagreeable to the general principles of republican government, as they\r\nshall think proper to render the Federal Constitution adequate to the\r\nexigencies of the Government and the preservation of the Union,\" and\r\n\"_to report such alterations and provisions as may be agreed to by a\r\nmajority of the United States in convention_, to the Congress of the\r\nUnited States and to the General Assembly of this State.\"\r\n\r\nThe General Court of New Hampshire authorized and empowered the deputies\r\nof that State, _in conference with those of other States_, \"to discuss\r\nand decide upon the most effectual means _to remedy the defects of our\r\nFederal Union, and to procure and secure the enlarged purposes which it\r\nwas intended to effect_\"--language almost identical with that of North\r\nCarolina, but, like the other States in general, instructed them to\r\nreport the result of their deliberations to Congress for the action of\r\nthat body, and subsequent confirmation \"by the several States.\"\r\n\r\nThe delegates from Maryland were appointed by the General Assembly of\r\nthat State, and instructed \"to meet such deputies as may be appointed\r\nand authorized _by any other of the United States_, to assemble in\r\nconvention at Philadelphia, _for the purpose of revising the Federal\r\nsystem_, and to join with them in considering such alterations and\r\nfurther provisions,\" etc.--the remainder of their instructions being in\r\nthe same words as those given to the Georgia delegates.\r\n\r\nThe instructions given to the deputies of Delaware were substantially in\r\naccord with the others--being almost literally identical with those of\r\nPennsylvania--but the following proviso was added: \"So, always, and\r\nprovided, that such alterations or further provisions, or any of them,\r\ndo not extend to that part of the fifth article of the Confederation of\r\nthe said States, finally ratified on the first day of March, in the year\r\n1781, which declares that, '_in determining questions in the United\r\nStates in Congress assembled, each State shall have one vote_.'\"\r\n\r\nRhode Island, as has already been mentioned, sent no delegates.\r\n\r\nFrom an examination and comparison of the enactments and instructions\r\nabove quoted, we may derive certain conclusions, so obvious that they\r\nneed only to be stated:\r\n\r\n1. In the first place, it is clear that the delegates to the Convention\r\nof 1787 represented, not _the people of the United States_ in mass, as\r\nhas been most absurdly contended by some political writers, but _the\r\npeople_ of the several States, _as States_--just as in the Congress of\r\nthat period--Delaware, with her sixty thousand inhabitants, having\r\nentire equality with Pennsylvania, which had more than four hundred\r\nthousand, or Virginia, with her seven hundred and fifty thousand.\r\n\r\n2. The object for which they were appointed was not to organize a _new_\r\nGovernment, but \"solely and expressly\" to amend the \"Federal\r\nConstitution\" already existing; in other words, \"to revise the Articles\r\nof Confederation,\" and to suggest such \"alterations\" or additional\r\n\"provisions\" as should be deemed necessary to render them \"adequate to\r\nthe exigencies of the Union.\"\r\n\r\n3. It is evident that the term \"Federal Constitution,\" or its\r\nequivalent, \"Constitution of the Federal Government,\" was as freely and\r\nfamiliarly applied to the system of government established by the\r\nArticles of Confederation--undeniably a league or compact between States\r\nexpressly retaining their sovereignty and independence--as to that\r\namended system which was substituted for it by the Constitution that\r\nsuperseded those articles.\r\n\r\n4. The functions of the delegates to the Convention were, of course,\r\nonly to devise, deliberate, and discuss. No validity could attach to any\r\naction taken, unless and until it should be afterward ratified by the\r\nseveral States. It is evident, also, that what was contemplated was the\r\nprocess provided in the Articles of Confederation for their own\r\namendment--first, a recommendation by the Congress; and, afterward,\r\nratification \"by the Legislatures of every State,\" before the amendment\r\nshould be obligatory upon any. The departure from this condition, which\r\nactually occurred, will presently be noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Dr. Worcester.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: This definition is very good as far as it goes, but \"the\r\nform of government\" is a phrase which falls short of expressing all that\r\nshould be comprehended. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say, \"which\r\nconstitute the form, _define the powers, and prescribe the functions_ of\r\ngovernment,\" etc. The words in italics would make the definition more\r\ncomplete.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    The Convention of 1787.--Diversity of Opinion.--Luther Martin's\r\n    Account of the Three Parties.--The Question of\r\n    Representation.--Compromise effected.--Mr. Randolph's\r\n    Resolutions.--The Word \"National\" condemned.--Plan of Government\r\n    framed.--Difficulty with Regard to Ratification, and its\r\n    Solution.--Provision for Secession from the Union.--Views of Mr.\r\n    Gerry and Mr. Madison.--False Interpretations.--Close of the\r\n    Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Convention met in Philadelphia, in May, 1787, it soon became\r\nevident that the work before it would take a wider range and involve\r\nmore radical changes in the \"Federal Constitution\" than had at first\r\nbeen contemplated. Under the Articles of Confederation the General\r\nGovernment was obliged to rely upon the governments of the several\r\nStates for the execution of its enactments. Except its own officers and\r\nemployees, and in time of war the Federal army and navy, it could\r\nexercise no control upon individual citizens. With regard to the States,\r\nno compulsory or coercive measures could be employed to enforce its\r\nauthority, in case of opposition or indifference to its exercise. This\r\nlast was a feature of the Confederation which it was not desirable nor\r\npossible to change, and no objection was made to it; but it was\r\ngenerally admitted that some machinery should be devised to enable the\r\nGeneral Government to exercise its legitimate functions by means of a\r\nmandatory authority operating directly upon the individual citizens\r\nwithin the limits of its constitutional powers. The necessity for such\r\nprovision was undisputed.\r\n\r\nBeyond the common ground of a recognition of this necessity there was a\r\nwide diversity of opinion among the members of the Convention. Luther\r\nMartin, a delegate from Maryland, in an account of its proceedings,\r\nafterward given to the Legislature of that State, classifies these\r\ndifferences as constituting three parties in the Convention, which he\r\ndescribes as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"One party, whose object and wish it was to abolish and\r\n    annihilate all State governments, and to bring forward one\r\n    General Government over this extensive continent of a\r\n    monarchical nature, under certain restrictions and limitations.\r\n    Those who openly avowed this sentiment were, it is true, but\r\n    few; yet it is equally true that there was a considerable\r\n    number, who did not openly avow it, who were, by myself and many\r\n    others of the Convention, considered as being in reality\r\n    favorers of that sentiment....\r\n\r\n    \"The second party was not for the abolition of the State\r\n    governments nor for the introduction of a monarchical government\r\n    under any form; but they wished to establish such a system as\r\n    could give their own States undue power and influence in the\r\n    government over the other States.\r\n\r\n    \"A third party was what I considered truly federal and\r\n    republican. This party was nearly equal in number with the other\r\n    two, and was composed of the delegates from Connecticut, New\r\n    York, New Jersey, Delaware, and in part from Maryland; also of\r\n    some individuals from other representations. This party were for\r\n    proceeding upon terms of federal equality: they were for taking\r\n    our present federal system as the basis of their proceedings,\r\n    and, as far as experience had shown that other powers were\r\n    necessary to the Federal Government, to give those powers. They\r\n    considered this the object for which they were sent by their\r\n    States, and what their States expected from them.\"\r\n\r\nIn his account of the second party above described, Mr. Martin refers to\r\nthose representatives of the larger States who wished to establish a\r\nnumerical basis of representation in the Congress, instead of the equal\r\nrepresentation of the States (whether large or small) which existed\r\nunder the Articles of Confederation. There was naturally much\r\ndissatisfaction on the part of the greater States--Virginia,\r\nPennsylvania, North Carolina, and Massachusetts--whose population at\r\nthat period exceeded that of all the others combined, but which, in the\r\nCongress, constituted less than one third of the voting strength. On the\r\nother hand, the smaller States were tenacious of their equality in the\r\nUnion. Of the very smallest, one, as we have seen, had sent no\r\nrepresentatives to the Convention, and the other had instructed her\r\ndelegates, unconditionally, to insist upon the maintenance of absolute\r\nequality in the Congress. This difference gave more trouble than any\r\nother question that came before the Convention, and for some time\r\nthreatened to prove irreconcilable and to hinder any final agreement. It\r\nwas ultimately settled by a compromise. Provision was made for the\r\nrepresentation of the people of the States in one branch of the Federal\r\nLegislature (the House of Representatives) in proportion to their\r\nnumbers; in the other branch (the Senate), for the equal representation\r\nof the States as such. The perpetuity of this equality was furthermore\r\nguaranteed by a stipulation that no State should ever be deprived of its\r\nequal suffrage in the Senate without its own consent.[31] This\r\ncompromise required no sacrifice of principle on either side, and no\r\nprovision of the Constitution has in practice proved more entirely\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, and would be beyond the scope of this work, to\r\nundertake to give a history of the proceedings of the Convention of\r\n1787. That may be obtained from other sources. All that is requisite for\r\nthe present purpose is to notice a few particulars of special\r\nsignificance or relevancy to the subject of inquiry.\r\n\r\nEarly in the session of the Convention a series of resolutions was\r\nintroduced by Mr. Edmund Randolph, of Virginia, embodying a proposed\r\nplan of government, which were considered in committee of the whole\r\nHouse, and formed the basis of a protracted discussion. The first of\r\nthese resolutions, as amended before a vote was taken, was in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved_, That it is the opinion of this committee that a\r\n    national Government ought to be established, consisting of a\r\n    supreme legislative, executive, and judiciary.\"\r\n\r\nThis was followed by other resolutions--twenty-three in all, as adopted\r\nand reported by the committee--in which the word \"national\" occurred\r\ntwenty-six times.\r\n\r\nThe day after the report of the committee was made, Mr. Ellsworth, of\r\nConnecticut, moved to strike out the words \"national Government\" in the\r\nresolution above quoted, and to insert the words \"Government of the\r\nUnited States,\" which he said was the proper title. \"He wished also the\r\nplan to go forth as an amendment of the Articles of Confederation.\"[32]\r\nThat is to say, he wished to avoid even the appearance of undertaking to\r\nform a _new_ government, instead of reforming the old one, which was the\r\nproper object of the Convention. This motion was agreed to without\r\nopposition, and, as a consequence, the word \"national\" was stricken out\r\nwherever it occurred, and nowhere makes its appearance in the\r\nConstitution finally adopted. The prompt rejection, after introduction,\r\nof this word \"national,\" is obviously much more expressive of the intent\r\nand purpose of the authors of the Constitution than its mere absence\r\nfrom the Constitution would have been. It is a clear indication that\r\nthey did not mean to give any countenance to the idea which, \"scotched,\r\nnot killed,\" has again reared its mischievous crest in these latter\r\ndays--that the government which they organized was a consolidated\r\n_nationality_, instead of a confederacy of sovereign members.\r\n\r\nContinuing their great work of revision and reorganization, the\r\nConvention proceeded to construct the framework of a government for the\r\nConfederacy, strictly confined to certain specified and limited powers,\r\nbut complete in all its parts, legislative, executive, and judicial, and\r\nprovided with the means for discharging all its functions without\r\ninterfering with the \"sovereignty, freedom, and independence\" of the\r\nconstituent States.\r\n\r\nAll this might have been done without going beyond the limits of their\r\ncommission \"to revise the Articles of Confederation,\" and to consider\r\nand report such \"alterations and provisions\" as might seem necessary to\r\n\"render the Federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of\r\ngovernment and the preservation of the Union.\" A serious difficulty,\r\nhowever, was foreseen. The thirteenth and last of the aforesaid articles\r\nhad this provision, which has already been referred to: \"The Articles of\r\nthis Confederation _shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the\r\nunion shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration, at any time\r\nhereafter, be made in any of them_, unless such alteration be agreed to\r\nin a Congress of the United States, and be afterward confirmed by the\r\nLegislatures of _every State_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, from an examination of the records, as has already been\r\nshown, that the original idea in calling a Convention was, that their\r\nrecommendations should take the course prescribed by this\r\narticle--first, a report to the Congress, and then, if approved by that\r\nbody, a submission to the various Legislatures for final action. There\r\nwas no reason to apprehend the non-concurrence of Congress, in which a\r\nmere majority would determine the question; but the consent of the\r\nLegislatures of \"_every State_\" was requisite in order to final\r\nratification, and there was serious reason to fear that this consent\r\ncould not be obtained. Rhode Island, as we have seen, had declined to\r\nsend any representatives to the Convention; of the three delegates from\r\nNew York, two had withdrawn; and other indications of dissatisfaction\r\nhad appeared. In case of the failure of a single Legislature to ratify,\r\nthe labors of the Convention would go for naught, under a strict\r\nadherence to the letter of the article above cited. The danger of a\r\ntotal frustration of their efforts was imminent.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency the Convention took the responsibility of transcending\r\nthe limits of their instructions, and recommending a procedure which was\r\nin direct contravention of the letter of the Articles of Confederation.\r\nThis was the introduction of a provision into the new Constitution, that\r\nthe ratification of _nine_ States should be sufficient for its\r\nestablishment among themselves. In order to validate this provision, it\r\nwas necessary to refer it to authority higher than that of Congress and\r\nthe State Legislatures--that is, to the People of the States, assembled,\r\nby their representatives, in convention. Hence it was provided, by the\r\nseventh and last article of the new Constitution, that \"the ratification\r\nof the _Conventions_ of nine States\" should suffice for its\r\nestablishment \"between the States so ratifying the same.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another reason, of a more general and perhaps more controlling\r\ncharacter, for this reference to conventions for ratification, even if\r\nentire unanimity of the State Legislatures could have been expected.\r\nUnder the American theory of republican government, conventions of the\r\npeople, duly elected and accredited as such, are invested with the\r\nplenary power inherent in the people of an organized and independent\r\ncommunity, assembled in mass. In other words, they represent and\r\nexercise what is properly the _sovereignty_ of the people. State\r\nLegislatures, with restricted powers, do not possess or represent\r\nsovereignty. Still less does the Congress of a union or confederacy of\r\nStates, which is by two degrees removed from the seat of sovereignty. We\r\nsometimes read or hear of \"delegated sovereignty,\" \"divided\r\nsovereignty,\" with other loose expressions of the same sort; but no such\r\nthing as a division or delegation of sovereignty is possible.\r\n\r\nIn order, therefore, to supersede the restraining article above cited\r\nand to give the highest validity to the compact for the delegation of\r\nimportant powers and functions of government to a common agent, an\r\nauthority above that of the State Legislatures was necessary. Mr.\r\nMadison, in the \"Federalist,\"[33] says: \"It has been heretofore noted\r\namong the defects of the Confederation, that in many of the States it\r\nhad received no higher sanction than a mere legislative ratification.\"\r\nThis objection would of course have applied with greater force to the\r\nproposed Constitution, which provided for additional grants of power\r\nfrom the States, and the conferring of larger and more varied powers\r\nupon a General Government, which was to act upon individuals instead of\r\nStates, if the question of its confirmation had been submitted merely to\r\nthe several State Legislatures. Hence the obvious propriety of referring\r\nit to the respective _people_ of the States in their sovereign capacity,\r\nas provided in the final article of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIn this article provision was deliberately made for the _secession_ (if\r\nnecessary) of a part of the States from a union which, when formed, had\r\nbeen declared \"perpetual,\" and its terms and articles to be \"inviolably\r\nobserved by every State.\"\r\n\r\nOpposition was made to the provision on this very ground--that it was\r\nvirtually a dissolution of the Union, and that it would furnish a\r\nprecedent for future secessions. Mr. Gerry, a distinguished member from\r\nMassachusetts--afterward Vice-President of the United States--said, \"If\r\nnine out of thirteen (States) can dissolve the compact, six out of nine\r\nwill be just as able to dissolve the future one hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Madison, who was one of the leading members of the Convention,\r\nadvocating afterward, in the \"Federalist,\" the adoption of the new\r\nConstitution, asks the question, \"On what principle the Confederation,\r\nwhich stands in the solemn form of a compact among the States, can be\r\nsuperseded without the unanimous consent of the parties to it?\" He\r\nanswers this question \"by recurring to the absolute necessity of the\r\ncase; to the great principle of self-preservation; to the transcendent\r\nlaw of nature and of nature's God, which declares that the safety and\r\nhappiness of society are the objects at which all political institutions\r\naim, and to which all such institutions must be sacrificed.\" He\r\nproceeds, however, to give other grounds of justification:\r\n\r\n    \"It is an established doctrine on the subject of treaties, that\r\n    all the articles are mutually conditions of each other; that a\r\n    breach of any one article is a breach of the whole treaty; and\r\n    that a breach committed by either of the parties absolves the\r\n    others, and authorizes them, if they please, to pronounce the\r\n    compact violated and void. Should it unhappily be necessary to\r\n    appeal to these delicate truths for a justification for\r\n    dispensing with the consent of particular States to a\r\n    dissolution of the Federal pact, will not the complaining\r\n    parties find it a difficult task to answer the multiplied and\r\n    important infractions with which they may be confronted? _The\r\n    time has been when it was incumbent on us all to veil the ideas\r\n    which this paragraph exhibits._ The scene is now changed, and\r\n    with it the part which the same motives dictate.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Madison's idea of the propriety of _veiling_ any statement of the\r\nright of secession until the occasion arises for its exercise, whether\r\nright or wrong in itself, is eminently suggestive as explanatory of the\r\ncaution exhibited by other statesmen of that period, as well as himself,\r\nwith regard to that \"delicate truth.\"\r\n\r\nThe only possible alternative to the view here taken of the seventh\r\narticle of the Constitution, as a provision for the secession of any\r\nnine States, which might think proper to avail themselves of it, from\r\nunion with such as should refuse to do so, and the formation of an\r\namended or \"more perfect union\" with one another, is to regard it as a\r\nprovision for the continuance of the old Union, or Confederation, under\r\naltered conditions, by the majority which should accede to them, with a\r\nrecognition of the right of the recusant minority to withdraw, secede,\r\nor stand aloof. The idea of compelling any State or States to enter into\r\nor to continue in union with the others by _coercion_, is as absolutely\r\nexcluded under the one supposition as under the other--with reference to\r\none State or a minority of States, as well as with regard to a majority.\r\nThe article declares that \"the ratification of the Conventions of nine\r\nStates shall be sufficient for the establishment of this\r\nConstitution\"--not between all, but--\"_between the States so ratifying\r\nthe same_.\" It is submitted whether a fuller justification of this right\r\nof the nine States to form a new Government is not found in the fact of\r\nthe sovereignty in each of them, making them \"a law unto themselves,\"\r\nand therefore the final judge of what the necessities of each community\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nHere--although, perhaps, in advance of its proper place in the\r\nargument--the attention of the reader may be directed to the refutation,\r\nafforded by this article of the Constitution, of that astonishing\r\nfiction, which has been put forward by some distinguished writers of\r\nlater date, that the Constitution was established by the people of the\r\nUnited States \"in the aggregate.\" If such had been the case, the will of\r\na majority, duly ascertained and expressed, would have been binding upon\r\nthe minority. No such idea existed in its formation. It was not even\r\nestablished by the _States in the aggregate_, nor was it proposed that\r\nit should be. It was submitted for the acceptance of each separately,\r\nthe time and place at their own option, so that the dates of\r\nratification did extend from December 7, 1787, to May 29, 1790. The long\r\nperiod required for these ratifications makes manifest the absurdity of\r\nthe assertion, that it was a decision by the votes of one people, or one\r\ncommunity, in which a majority of the votes cast determined the result.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the delegates to the Convention of 1787 were chosen by\r\nthe several States, _as States_--it is hardly necessary to add that they\r\nvoted in the Convention, as in the Federal Congress, by States--each\r\nState casting one vote. We have seen, also, that they were sent for the\r\n\"sole and express purpose\" of revising the Articles of Confederation and\r\ndevising means for rendering the Federal Constitution, \"adequate to the\r\nexigencies of government and the preservation of the Union\"; that the\r\nterms \"Union,\" \"United States,\" \"Federal Constitution;\" and\r\n\"Constitution of the Federal Government,\" were applied to the old\r\nConfederation in precisely the same sense in which they are used under\r\nthe new; that the proposition to constitute a \"national\" Government was\r\ndistinctly rejected by the Convention; that the right of any State, or\r\nStates, to withdraw from union with the others was practically\r\nexemplified, and that the idea of coercion of a State, or compulsory\r\nmeasures, was distinctly excluded under any construction that can be put\r\nupon the action of the Convention.\r\n\r\nTo the original copy of the Constitution, as set forth by its framers\r\nfor the consideration and final action of the people of the States, was\r\nattached the following words:\r\n\r\n    \"Done in Convention, by the unanimous consent of the States\r\n    present, the seventeenth day of September, in the year of our\r\n    Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven, and of the\r\n    Independence of the United States of America, the twelfth. In\r\n    witness whereof, we have hereunto subscribed our names.\"\r\n\r\n[Followed by the signatures of \"George Washington, President, and deputy\r\nfrom Virginia,\" and the other delegates who signed it.]\r\n\r\nThis attachment to the instrument--a mere attestation of its\r\nauthenticity, and of the fact that it had the unanimous consent _of all\r\nthe States_ then present by their deputies--not _of all the deputies_,\r\nfor some of them refused to sign it--has been strangely construed by\r\nsome commentators as if it were a part of the Constitution, and implied\r\nthat it was \"done,\" in the sense of completion of the work.[34]\r\n\r\nBut the work was not _done_ when the Convention closed its labors and\r\nadjourned. It was scarcely begun. There was no validity or binding force\r\nwhatever in what had been already \"done.\" It was still to be submitted\r\nto the States for approval or rejection. Even if a majority of eight out\r\nof thirteen States had ratified it, the refusal of the ninth would have\r\nrendered it null and void. Mr. Madison, who was one of the most\r\ndistinguished of its authors and signers, writing after it was completed\r\nand signed, but before it was ratified, said: \"It is time now to\r\nrecollect that the powers [of the Convention] were merely advisory and\r\nrecommendatory; that they were so meant by the States, and so understood\r\nby the Convention; and that the latter have accordingly planned and\r\nproposed a Constitution, which is to be of no more consequence than the\r\npaper on which it is written, unless it be stamped with the approbation\r\nof those to whom it is addressed.\"--(\"Federalist,\" No. XL.)\r\n\r\nThe mode and terms in which this approval was expressed will be\r\nconsidered in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Constitution, Article V.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: See Elliott's \"Debates,\" vol. v, p. 214. This reference is\r\ntaken from \"The Republic of Republics,\" Part III, chapter vii, p. 217.\r\nThis learned, exhaustive, and admirable work, which contains a wealth of\r\nhistorical and political learning, will be freely used, by kind consent\r\nof the author, without the obligation of a repetition of special\r\nacknowledgment in every case. A like liberty will be taken with the late\r\nDr. Bledsoe's masterly treatise on the right of secession, published in\r\n1866, under the title, \"Is Davis a Traitor? or, Was Secession a\r\nConstitutional Right?\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: No. xliii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: See \"Republic of Republics,\" Part II, chapters xiii and\r\nxiv.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n    Ratification of the Constitution by the States.--Organization of\r\n    the New Government.--Accession of North Carolina and Rhode\r\n    Island.--Correspondence between General Washington and the\r\n    Governor of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amended system of union, or confederation (the terms are employed\r\nindiscriminately and interchangeably by the statesmen of that period),\r\ndevised by the Convention of 1787, and embodied, as we have seen, in the\r\nConstitution which they framed and have set forth, was now to be\r\nconsidered and acted on by the people of the several States. This they\r\ndid in the highest and most majestic form in which the sanction of\r\norganized communities could be given or withheld--not through\r\nambassadors, or Legislatures, or deputies with limited powers, but\r\nthrough conventions of delegates chosen expressly for the purpose and\r\nclothed with the plenary authority of sovereign people. The action of\r\nthese conventions was deliberate, cautious, and careful. There was much\r\ndebate, and no little opposition to be conciliated. Eleven States,\r\nhowever, ratified and adopted the new Constitution within the twelve\r\nmonths immediately following its submission to them. Two of them\r\npositively rejected it, and, although they afterward acceded to it,\r\nremained outside of the Union in the exercise of their sovereign right,\r\nwhich nobody then denied--North Carolina for nine months, Rhode Island\r\nfor nearly fifteen, after the new Government was organized and went into\r\noperation. In several of the other States the ratification was effected\r\nonly by small majorities.\r\n\r\nThe terms in which this action was expressed by the several States and\r\nthe declarations with which it was accompanied by some of them are\r\nworthy of attention.\r\n\r\nDelaware was the first to act. Her Convention met on December 3, 1787,\r\nand ratified the Constitution on the 7th. The readiness of this least in\r\npopulation, and next to the least in territorial extent, of all the\r\nStates, to accept that instrument, is a very significant fact when we\r\nremember the jealous care with which she had guarded against any\r\ninfringement of her sovereign Statehood. Delaware alone had given\r\nspecial instructions to her deputies in the Convention not to consent to\r\nany sacrifice of the principle of equal representation in Congress. The\r\npromptness and unanimity of her people in adopting the new Constitution\r\nprove very clearly, not only that they were satisfied with the\r\npreservation of that principle in the Federal Senate, but that they did\r\nnot understand the Constitution, in any of its features, as compromising\r\nthe \"sovereignty, freedom, and independence\" which she had so especially\r\ncherished. The ratification of their Convention is expressed in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n    \"We, the deputies of _the people of the Delaware State_, in\r\n    convention met, having taken into our serious consideration the\r\n    Federal Constitution proposed and agreed upon by the deputies of\r\n    the United States at a General Convention held at the city of\r\n    Philadelphia on the 17th day of September, A. D. 1787, have\r\n    _approved of, assented to, and ratified and confirmed_, and by\r\n    these presents do, in virtue of the powers and authority to us\r\n    given for that purpose, for and in behalf of ourselves and our\r\n    constituents, fully, freely, and entirely, _approve of, assent\r\n    to, ratify, and confirm_ the said Constitution.\r\n\r\n    \"Done in convention at Dover, December 7, 1787.\"\r\n\r\nThis, and twelve other like acts, gave to the Constitution \"all the life\r\nand validity it ever had, or could have, as to the thirteen united or\r\nassociated States.\"\r\n\r\nPennsylvania acted next (December 12, 1787), the ratification not being\r\nfinally accomplished without strong opposition, on grounds which will be\r\nreferred to hereafter. In announcing its decision, the Convention of\r\nthis State began as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"In the name of _the people of Pennsylvania_. Be it known unto\r\n    all men that we, _the delegates of the people of the\r\n    Commonwealth of Pennsylvania_, in General Convention assembled,\"\r\n    etc., etc., concluding with these words: \"By these presents, do,\r\n    _in the name and by the authority of the same people_, and for\r\n    ourselves, assent to and ratify the foregoing Constitution for\r\n    the United States of America.\"\r\n\r\nIn New Jersey the ratification, which took place on the 18th of\r\nDecember, was unanimous. This is no less significant and instructive\r\nthan the unanimity of Delaware, from the fact that the New Jersey\r\ndelegation, in the Convention that framed the Constitution, had taken\r\nthe lead in behalf of the federal, or State-rights, idea, in opposition\r\nto that of nationalism, or consolidation. William Patterson, a\r\ndistinguished citizen (afterward Governor) of New Jersey, had introduced\r\ninto that Convention what was known as \"the Jersey plan,\" embodying\r\nthese State-rights principles, as distinguished from the various\r\n\"national\" plans presented. In defending them, he had said, after\r\ncalling for the reading of the credentials of delegates:\r\n\r\n    \"Can we, on this ground, form a national Government? I fancy\r\n    not. Our commissions give a complexion to the business; and can\r\n    we suppose that, when we exceed the bounds of our duty, the\r\n    people will approve our proceedings?\r\n\r\n    \"We are met here as the deputies of _thirteen independent,\r\n    sovereign States, for federal purposes. Can we consolidate their\r\n    sovereignty and form one nation_, and annihilate the\r\n    sovereignties of our States, who have sent us here for other\r\n    purposes?\"\r\n\r\nAgain, on a subsequent day, after stating that he was not there to\r\npursue his own sentiments of government, but of those who had sent him,\r\nhe had asked:\r\n\r\n    \"Can we, _as representatives of independent States_, annihilate\r\n    the essential powers of independency? Are not the votes of this\r\n    Convention taken on every question under the idea of\r\n    independency?\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that this State, which, through her representatives, had taken\r\nso conspicuous a part in the maintenance of the principle of State\r\nsovereignty, ratified the Constitution with such readiness and\r\nunanimity, is conclusive proof that, in her opinion, that principle was\r\nnot compromised thereby. The conclusion of her ordinance of ratification\r\nis in these words:\r\n\r\n    \"Now be it known that we, the delegates of _the State of New\r\n    Jersey_, chosen by the people thereof for the purpose aforesaid,\r\n    having maturely deliberated on and considered the aforesaid\r\n    proposed Constitution, do hereby, for and on behalf of the\r\n    _people of the said State of New Jersey_, agree to, ratify, and\r\n    confirm the same, and every part thereof.\r\n\r\n    \"Done in convention, by the unanimous consent of the members\r\n    present, this 18th day of December, A. D. 1787.\"\r\n\r\nGeorgia next, and also unanimously, on January 2, 1788, declared,\r\nthrough \"_the delegates of the State of Georgia_, in convention met,\r\npursuant to the provisions of the [act of the] Legislature aforesaid ...\r\nin virtue of the powers and authority given us [them] by _the people of\r\nthe said State_, for that purpose,\" that they did \"fully and entirely\r\nassent to, ratify, and adopt the said Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nConnecticut (on the 9th of January) declares her assent with equal\r\ndistinctness of assertion as to the source of the authority: \"In the\r\nname of _the people of the State of Connecticut_, we, the delegates of\r\n_the people of the said State_, in General Convention assembled,\r\npursuant to an act of the Legislature in October last ... do assent to,\r\nratify, and adopt the Constitution reported by the Convention of\r\ndelegates in Philadelphia.\"\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts there was a sharp contest. The people of that State\r\nwere then--as for a long time afterward--exceedingly tenacious of their\r\nState independence and sovereignty. The proposed Constitution was\r\nsubjected to a close, critical, and rigorous examination with reference\r\nto its bearing upon this very point. The Convention was a large one, and\r\nsome of its leading members were very distrustful of the instrument\r\nunder their consideration. It was ultimately adopted by a very close\r\nvote (187 to 168), and then only as accompanied by certain proposed\r\namendments, the object of which was to guard more expressly against any\r\nsacrifice or compromise of State sovereignty, and under an assurance,\r\ngiven by the advocates of the Constitution, of the certainty that those\r\namendments would be adopted. The most strenuously urged of these was\r\nthat ultimately adopted (in substance) as the tenth amendment to the\r\nConstitution, which was intended to take the place of the second Article\r\nof Confederation, as an emphatic assertion of the continued freedom,\r\nsovereignty, and independence of the States. This will be considered\r\nmore particularly hereafter.\r\n\r\nIn terms substantially identical with those employed by the other\r\nStates, Massachusetts thus announced her ratification:\r\n\r\n    \"In convention of the delegates of _the people of the\r\n    Commonwealth of Massachusetts_, 1788. The Convention having\r\n    impartially discussed and fully considered the Constitution for\r\n    the United States of America, reported [etc.] ... do, in the\r\n    name and in behalf of _the people of the Commonwealth of\r\n    Massachusetts_, assent to and ratify the said Constitution for\r\n    the United States of America.\"\r\n\r\nThis was accomplished on February 7, 1788.\r\n\r\nMaryland followed on the 28th of April, and South Carolina on the 23d of\r\nMay, in equivalent expressions, the ratification of the former being\r\nmade by \"the delegates of _the people of Maryland_,\" speaking, as they\r\ndeclared, for ourselves, and in the name and on the behalf of _the\r\npeople of this State_; that of the latter, \"in convention of _the people\r\nof the State of South Carolina_, by their representatives, ... in the\r\nname and behalf of _the people of this State_.\"\r\n\r\nBut South Carolina, like Massachusetts, demanded certain amendments, and\r\nfor greater assurance accompanied her ordinance of ratification with the\r\nfollowing distinct assertion of the principle afterward embodied in the\r\ntenth amendment:\r\n\r\n    \"This Convention doth also declare that _no section or\r\n    paragraph_ of the said Constitution warrants a construction that\r\n    _the States do not retain every power not expressly relinquished\r\n    by them_ and vested in the General Government of the Union.\"\r\n\r\n\"The delegates of _the people of the State of New Hampshire_,\" in\r\nconvention, on the 21st of June, \"in the name and behalf of _the people\r\nof the State of New Hampshire_,\" declared their approval and adoption of\r\nthe Constitution. In this State, also, the opposition was formidable\r\n(the final vote being 57 to 46), and, as in South Carolina, it was\r\n\"explicitly declared that all powers not expressly and particularly\r\ndelegated by the aforesaid Constitution are reserved to the several\r\nStates, to be by them exercised.\"\r\n\r\nThe debates in the Virginia Convention were long and animated. Some of\r\nthe most eminent and most gifted men of that period took part in them,\r\nand they have ever since been referred to for the exposition which they\r\nafford of the interpretation of the Constitution by its authors and\r\ntheir contemporaries. Among the members were Madison, Mason, and\r\nRandolph, who had also been members of the Convention at Philadelphia.\r\nMr. Madison was one of the most earnest advocates of the new\r\nConstitution, while Mr. Mason was as warmly opposed to its adoption; so\r\nalso was Patrick Henry, the celebrated orator. It was assailed with\r\ngreat vehemence at every vulnerable or doubtful point, and was finally\r\nratified June 26, 1788, by a vote of 89 to 79--a majority of only ten.\r\n\r\nThis ratification was expressed in the same terms employed by other\r\nStates, by \"the delegates of _the people of Virginia_ ... in the name\r\nand in behalf of _the people of Virginia_.\" In so doing, however, like\r\nMassachusetts, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, Virginia demanded\r\ncertain amendments as a more explicit guarantee against consolidation,\r\nand accompanied the demand with the following declaration:\r\n\r\n    \"That the powers granted under the Constitution, being derived\r\n    from the people of the United States, may be resumed by them,\r\n    whenever the same shall be perverted to their injury or\r\n    oppression, and that every power not granted thereby remains\r\n    with them and at their will,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nWhether, in speaking of a possible _resumption_ of powers by \"the people\r\nof the United States,\" the Convention had in mind the action of such a\r\npeople _in the aggregate_--political community which did not exist, and\r\nof which they, could hardly have entertained even an ideal\r\nconception--or of the people of Virginia, for whom they were speaking,\r\nand of the other United States then taking similar action--is a question\r\nwhich scarcely admits of argument, but which will be more fully\r\nconsidered in the proper place.\r\n\r\nNew York, the eleventh State to signify her assent, did so on July 26,\r\n1788, after an arduous and protracted discussion, and then by a majority\r\nof but three votes--30 to 27. Even this small majority was secured only\r\nby the recommendation of certain material amendments, the adoption of\r\nwhich by the other States it was at first proposed to make a condition\r\nprecedent to the validity of the ratification. This idea was abandoned\r\nafter a correspondence between Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Madison, and,\r\ninstead of conditional ratification, New York provided for the\r\nresumption of her grants; but the amendments were put forth with a\r\ncircular letter to the other States, in which it was declared that\r\n\"nothing but the fullest confidence of obtaining a revision\" of the\r\nobjectionable features of the Constitution, \"and an invincible\r\nreluctance to separating from our sister States, could have prevailed\r\nupon a sufficient number to ratify it without stipulating for previous\r\namendments.\"\r\n\r\nThe ratification was expressed in the usual terms, as made \"_by the\r\ndelegates of the people of the State of New York_ ... in the name and in\r\nbehalf of the people\" of the said State. Accompanying it was a\r\ndeclaration of the principles in which the assent of New York was\r\nconceded, one paragraph of which runs as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"That the powers of government may be _reassumed_ by the people,\r\n    whensoever it shall become necessary to their happiness; that\r\n    every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not, by the said\r\n    Constitution, clearly delegated to the Congress of the United\r\n    States, or the departments of the Government thereof, remains to\r\n    the people of the several _States_, or to their respective State\r\n    governments, to whom they may have granted the same; and that\r\n    those clauses in the said Constitution which declare that\r\n    Congress shall not have or exercise certain powers, do not imply\r\n    that Congress is entitled to any powers not given by the said\r\n    Constitution, but such clauses are to be construed either as\r\n    exceptions to certain specified powers or as inserted for\r\n    greater caution.\"\r\n\r\nThe acceptance of these eleven States having been signified to the\r\nCongress, provision was made for putting the new Constitution in\r\noperation. This was effected on March 4, 1789, when the Government was\r\norganized, with George Washington as President, and John Adams,\r\nVice-President; the Senators and Representatives elected by the States\r\nwhich had acceded to the Constitution, organizing themselves as a\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nMeantime, two States were standing, as we have seen, unquestioned and\r\nunmolested, in an attitude of absolute independence. The Convention of\r\nNorth Carolina, on August 2, 1788, had rejected the proposed\r\nConstitution, or, more properly speaking, had withheld her ratification\r\nuntil action could be taken upon the subject-matter of the following\r\nresolution adopted by her Convention:\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved_, That a declaration of rights, asserting and\r\n    securing from encroachment the great principles of civil and\r\n    religious liberty, and the unalienable rights of the people,\r\n    together with amendments to the most ambiguous and exceptionable\r\n    parts of the said Constitution of government, ought to be laid\r\n    before Congress and the Convention of the States that shall or\r\n    may be called for the purpose of amending the said Constitution,\r\n    for their consideration, previous to the ratification of the\r\n    Constitution aforesaid on the part of the State of North\r\n    Carolina.\"\r\n\r\nMore than a year afterward, when the newly organized Government had been\r\nin operation for nearly nine months, and when--although no convention of\r\nthe States had been called to revise the Constitution--North Carolina\r\nhad good reason to feel assured that the most important provisions of\r\nher proposed amendments and \"declaration of rights\" would be adopted,\r\nshe acceded to the amended compact. On November 21, 1789, her Convention\r\nagreed, \"in behalf of the freemen, citizens, and inhabitants of _the\r\nState of North Carolina_,\" to \"adopt and ratify\" the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIn Rhode Island the proposed Constitution was at first submitted to a\r\ndirect vote of the people, who rejected it by an overwhelming majority.\r\nSubsequently--that is, on May 29, 1790, when the reorganized Government\r\nhad been in operation for nearly fifteen months, and when it had become\r\nreasonably certain that the amendments thought necessary would be\r\nadopted--a convention of the people of Rhode Island acceded to the new\r\nUnion, and ratified the Constitution, though even then by a majority of\r\nonly two votes in sixty-six--34 to 32. The ratification was expressed in\r\nsubstantially the same language as that which has now been so repeatedly\r\ncited:\r\n\r\n    \"We, the delegates of the people of the State of Rhode Island\r\n    and Providence Plantations, duly elected and met in convention,\r\n    ... in the name and behalf of _the people of Rhode Island and\r\n    Providence Plantations_, do, by these presents, assent to and\r\n    ratify the said Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nIt is particularly to be noted that, during the intervals between the\r\norganization of the Federal Government under the new Constitution and\r\nthe ratification of that Constitution by, North Carolina and Rhode\r\nIsland, respectively, those States were absolutely independent and\r\nunconnected with any other political community, unless they be\r\nconsidered as still representing the \"United States of America,\" which\r\nby the Articles of Confederation had been declared a \"perpetual union.\"\r\nThe other States had seceded from the former union--not in a body, but\r\nseparately, each for itself--and had formed a new association, leaving\r\nthese two States in the attitude of foreign though friendly powers.\r\nThere was no claim of any right to control their action, as if they had\r\nbeen mere geographical or political divisions of one great consolidated\r\ncommunity or \"nation.\" Their accession to the Union was desired, but\r\ntheir freedom of choice in the matter was never questioned. And then it\r\nis to be noted, on _their_ part, that, like the house of Judah, they\r\nrefrained from any attempt to force the seceding sisters to return.\r\n\r\nAs illustrative of the relations existing during this period between the\r\nUnited States and Rhode Island, it may not be uninstructive to refer to\r\na letter sent by the government of the latter to the President and\r\nCongress, and transmitted by the President to the Senate, with the\r\nfollowing note:\r\n\r\n    \"United States, _September 26, 1789_.\r\n\r\n    \"Gentlemen of the Senate: Having yesterday received a letter\r\n    written in this month by the Governor of Rhode Island, at the\r\n    request and in behalf of the General Assembly of that State,\r\n    addressed to the President, the Senate, and the House of\r\n    Representatives of the eleven United States of America in\r\n    Congress assembled, I take the earliest opportunity of laying a\r\n    copy of it before you.\"\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"GEORGE WASHINGTON.\"\r\n\r\nSome extracts from the communication referred to are annexed:\r\n\r\n    \"State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, _In General\r\n    Assembly, September Session, 1789_.\r\n\r\n    \"_To the President, the Senate, and the House of Representatives\r\n    of the eleven United States of America in Congress assembled:_\r\n\r\n    \"The critical situation in which the people of this State are\r\n    placed engages us to make these assurances, on their behalf, of\r\n    their attachment and friendship to their sister States, and of\r\n    their disposition to cultivate mutual harmony and friendly\r\n    intercourse. They know themselves to be a handful, comparatively\r\n    viewed, and, although they now stand as it were alone, they have\r\n    not separated themselves or departed from the principles of that\r\n    Confederation, which was formed by the sister States in their\r\n    struggle for freedom and in the hour of danger....\r\n\r\n    \"Our not having acceded to or adopted the new system of\r\n    government formed and adopted by most of our sister States, we\r\n    doubt not, has given uneasiness to them. That we have not seen\r\n    our way clear to it, consistently with our idea of the\r\n    principles upon which we all embarked together, has also given\r\n    pain to us. We have not doubted that we might thereby avoid\r\n    present difficulties, but we have apprehended future\r\n    mischief....\r\n\r\n    \"Can it be thought strange that, with these impressions, they\r\n    [the people of this State] should wait to see the proposed\r\n    system organized and in operation?--to see what further checks\r\n    and securities would be agreed to and established by way of\r\n    amendments, before they could adopt it as a Constitution of\r\n    government for themselves and their posterity?...\r\n\r\n    \"We are induced to hope that we shall not be altogether\r\n    considered as foreigners having no particular affinity or\r\n    connection with the United States; but that trade and commerce,\r\n    upon which the prosperity of this State much depends, will be\r\n    preserved as free and open between this State and the United\r\n    States, as our different situations at present can possibly\r\n    admit....\r\n\r\n    \"We feel ourselves attached by the strongest ties of friendship,\r\n    kindred, and interest, to our sister States; and we can not,\r\n    without the greatest reluctance, look to any other quarter for\r\n    those advantages of commercial intercourse which we conceive to\r\n    be more natural and reciprocal between them and us.\r\n\r\n    \"I am, at the request and in behalf of the General Assembly,\r\n    your most obedient, humble servant.\"\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"John Collins, _Governor_.\r\n\r\n    \"_His Excellency, the President of the United States._\"\r\n\r\n    [American State Papers, _Vol. I_, Miscellaneous.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    The Constitution not adopted by one People \"in the\r\n    Aggregate.\"--A Great Fallacy exposed.--Mistake of Judge\r\n    Story.--Colonial Relations.--The United Colonies of New\r\n    England.--Other Associations.--Independence of Communities\r\n    traced from Germany to Great Britain, and from Great Britain to\r\n    America.--Mr. Everett's \"Provincial People.\"--Origin and\r\n    Continuance of the Title \"United States.\"--No such Political\r\n    Community as the \"People of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe historical retrospect of the last three chapters and the extracts\r\nfrom the records of a generation now departed have been presented as\r\nnecessary to a right understanding of the nature and principles of the\r\ncompact of 1787, on which depended the questions at issue in the\r\nsecession of 1861 and the contest that ensued between the States.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the united colonies, when they declared their\r\nindependence, formed a league or alliance with one another as \"United\r\nStates.\" This title antedated the adoption of the Articles of\r\nConfederation. It was assumed immediately after the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and was continued under the Articles of Confederation; the\r\nfirst of which declared that \"the style of this confederacy shall be\r\n'The United States of America'\"; and this style was retained--without\r\nquestion--in the formation of the present Constitution. The name was not\r\nadopted as antithetical to, or distinctive from, \"confederate,\" as some\r\nseem to have imagined. If it has any significance now, it must have had\r\nthe same under the Articles of Confederation, or even before they were\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nIt has been fully shown that the States which thus became and continued\r\nto be \"united,\" whatever form their union assumed, acted and continued\r\nto act as distinct and sovereign political communities. The monstrous\r\nfiction that they acted as _one people \"in their aggregate capacity\"_\r\nhas not an atom of fact to serve as a basis.\r\n\r\nTo go back to the very beginning, the British colonies never constituted\r\none people. Judge Story, in his \"Commentaries\" on the Constitution,\r\nseems to imply the contrary, though he shrinks from a direct assertion\r\nof it, and clouds the subject by a confusion of terms. He says: \"Now, it\r\nis apparent that none of the colonies before the Revolution were, in the\r\nmost large and general sense, independent or sovereign communities. They\r\nwere all originally settled under and subjected to the British Crown.\"\r\nAnd then he proceeds to show that they were, in their colonial\r\ncondition, not _sovereign_--a proposition which nobody disputed. As\r\ncolonies, they had no claim, and made no pretension, to sovereignty.\r\nThey were subject to the British Crown, unless, like the Plymouth\r\ncolony, \"a law unto themselves,\" but they were _independent of each\r\nother_--the only point which has any bearing upon their subsequent\r\nrelations. There was no other bond between them than that of their\r\ncommon allegiance to the Government of the mother-country. As an\r\nillustration of this may be cited the historical fact that, when John\r\nStark, of Bennington memory, was before the Revolution engaged in a\r\nhunting expedition in the Indian country, he was captured by the savages\r\nand brought to Albany, in the colony of New York, for a ransom; but,\r\ninasmuch as he belonged to New Hampshire, the government of New York\r\ntook no action for his release. There was not even enough community of\r\nfeeling to induce individual citizens to provide money for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, local and partial confederacies among the New\r\nEngland colonies, long before the Declaration of Independence. As early\r\nas the year 1643 a Congress had been organized of delegates from\r\nMassachusetts, Plymouth, New Haven, and Connecticut, under the style of\r\n\"The United Colonies of New England.\" The objects of this confederacy,\r\naccording to Mr. Bancroft, were \"protection against the encroachments of\r\nthe Dutch and French, security against the tribes of savages, the\r\nliberties of the gospel in purity and in peace.\"[35] The general affairs\r\nof the company were intrusted to commissions, two from each colony; but\r\nthe same historian tells us that \"to each its respective local\r\njurisdiction was carefully reserved,\" and he refers to this as evidence\r\nthat the germ-principle of State-rights was even then in existence.\r\n\"Thus remarkable for unmixed simplicity\" (he proceeds) \"was the form of\r\nthe first confederated government in America.... There was no president,\r\nexcept as a moderator of its meetings, and the larger State [_sic_],\r\nMassachusetts, superior to all the rest in territory, wealth, and\r\npopulation, had no greater number of votes than New Haven. But the\r\ncommissioners were in reality little more than a deliberative body; they\r\npossessed no executive power, and, while they could decree a war and a\r\nlevy of troops, it remained for the States to carry their votes into\r\neffect.\"[36]\r\n\r\nThis confederacy continued in existence for nearly fifty years. Between\r\nthat period and the year 1774, when the first Continental Congress met\r\nin Philadelphia, several other temporary and provisional associations of\r\ncolonies had been formed, and the people had been taught the advantages\r\nof union for a common purpose; but they had never abandoned or\r\ncompromised the great principle of community independence. That form of\r\nself-government, generated in the German forests before the days of the\r\nCæsars, had given to that rude people a self-reliance and patriotism\r\nwhich first checked the flight of the Roman eagles, which elsewhere had\r\nbeen the emblem of their dominion over the known world. This\r\nprinciple--the great preserver of all communal freedom and of mutual\r\nharmony--was transplanted by the Saxons into England, and there\r\nsustained those personal rights which, after the fall of the Heptarchy,\r\nwere almost obliterated by the encroachments of Norman despotism; but,\r\nhaving the strength and perpetuity of truth and right, were reasserted\r\nby the mailed hands of the barons at Runnymede for their own benefit and\r\nthat of their posterity. Englishmen, the early settlers, brought this\r\nidea to the wilds of America, and it found expression in many forms\r\namong the infant colonies.\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Everett, in his Fourth-of-July address, delivered in New York\r\nin 1861, following the lead of Judge Story, and with even less caution,\r\nboldly declares that, \"before their independence of England was\r\nasserted, they [the colonies] constituted _a provincial people_.\" To\r\nsustain this position--utterly contrary to all history as it is--he is\r\nunable to adduce any valid American authority, but relies almost\r\nexclusively upon loose expressions employed in debate in the British\r\nParliament about the period of the American Revolution--such as \"that\r\npeople,\" \"that loyal and respectable people,\" \"this enlightened and\r\nspirited people,\" etc., etc. The speakers who made use of this\r\ncolloquial phraseology concerning the inhabitants of a distant\r\ncontinent, in the freedom of extemporaneous debate, were not framing\r\ntheir ideas with the exactitude of a didactic treatise, and could little\r\nhave foreseen the extraordinary use to be made of their expressions\r\nnearly a century afterward, in sustaining a theory contradictory to\r\nhistory as well as to common sense. It is as if the familiar expressions\r\noften employed in our own time, such as \"the people of Africa,\" or \"the\r\npeople of South America,\" should be cited, by some ingenious theorist of\r\na future generation, as evidence that the subjects of the Khedive and\r\nthose of the King of Dahomey were but \"one people,\" or that the\r\nPeruvians and the Patagonians belonged to the same political community.\r\n\r\nMr. Everett, it is true, quotes two expressions of the Continental\r\nCongress to sustain his remarkable proposition that the colonies were \"a\r\npeople.\" One of these is found in a letter addressed by the Congress to\r\nGeneral Gage in October, 1774, remonstrating against the erection of\r\nfortifications in Boston, in which they say, \"We entreat your Excellency\r\nto consider what a tendency this conduct must have to irritate and force\r\n_a free people_, hitherto well disposed to peaceable measures, into\r\nhostilities.\" From this expression Mr. Everett argues that the Congress\r\nconsidered themselves the representatives of \"a people.\" But, by\r\nreference to the proceedings of the Congress, he might readily have\r\nascertained that the letter to General Gage was written in behalf of\r\n\"_the town of Boston and Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\" the people of\r\nwhich were \"considered by all America as suffering in the common cause\r\nfor their noble and spirited opposition to oppressive acts of\r\nParliament.\" The avowed object was \"to entreat his Excellency, from the\r\nassurance we have of the peaceable disposition of _the inhabitants of\r\nthe town of Boston and of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_, to\r\ndiscontinue his fortifications.\"[37] These were the \"people\" referred to\r\nby the Congress; and the children of the Pilgrims, who occupied at that\r\nperiod the town of Boston and Province of Massachusetts Bay, would have\r\nbeen not a little astonished to be reckoned as \"one people,\" in any\r\nother respect than that of the \"common cause,\" with the Roman Catholics\r\nof Maryland, the Episcopalians of Virginia, the Quakers of Pennsylvania,\r\nor the Baptists of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nThe other citation of Mr. Everett is from the first sentence of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence: \"When in the course of human events it\r\nbecomes necessary for _one people_ to dissolve the political bands which\r\nhave connected them with another,\" etc., etc. This, he says,\r\ncharacterizes \"the good people\" of the colonies as \"one people.\"\r\n\r\nPlainly, it does no such thing. The misconception is so palpable as\r\nscarcely to admit of serious answer. The Declaration of Independence\r\nopens with a general proposition. \"One people\" is equivalent to saying\r\n\"_any_ people.\" The use of the correlatives \"one\" and \"another\" was the\r\nsimple and natural way of stating this general proposition. \"One people\"\r\napplies, and was obviously intended to apply, to all cases of the same\r\ncategory--to that of New Hampshire, or Delaware, or South Carolina, or\r\nof any other people existing or to exist, and whether acting separately\r\nor in concert. It applies to any case, and all cases, of dissolution of\r\npolitical bands, as well as to the case of the British colonies. It does\r\nnot, either directly or by implication, assert their unification, and\r\nhas no bearing whatever upon the question.\r\n\r\nWhen the colonies united in sending representatives to a Congress in\r\nPhiladelphia, there was no purpose--no suggestion of a purpose--to merge\r\ntheir separate individuality in one consolidated mass. No such idea\r\nexisted, or with their known opinions could have existed. They did not\r\nassume to become a united colony or province, but styled themselves\r\n\"united colonies\"--colonies united for purposes of mutual counsel and\r\ndefense, as the New England colonies had been united more than a hundred\r\nyears before. It was as \"_United States_\"--not as a state, or united\r\npeople--that these colonies--still distinct and politically independent\r\nof each other--asserted and achieved their independence of the\r\nmother-country. As \"United States\" they adopted the Articles of\r\nConfederation, in which the separate sovereignty, freedom, and\r\nindependence of each was distinctly asserted. They were \"united States\"\r\nwhen Great Britain acknowledged the absolute freedom and independence of\r\neach, distinctly and separately recognized by name. France and Spain\r\nwere parties to the same treaty, and the French and Spanish idioms still\r\nexpress and perpetuate, more exactly than the English, the true idea\r\nintended to be embodied in the title--_les États Unis_, or _los Estados\r\nUnidos_--the States united.\r\n\r\nIt was without any change of title--still as \"United States\"--without\r\nany sacrifice of individuality--without any compromise of\r\nsovereignty--that the same parties entered into a new and amended\r\ncompact with one another under the present Constitution. Larger and more\r\nvaried powers were conferred upon the common Government for the purpose\r\nof insuring \"a more perfect union\"--not for that of destroying or\r\nimpairing the integrity of the contracting members.\r\n\r\nThe point which now specially concerns the argument is the historical\r\nfact that, in all these changes of circumstances and of government,\r\nthere has never been one single instance of action by the \"people of the\r\nUnited States in the aggregate,\" or as one body. Before the era of\r\nindependence, whatever was done by the people of the colonies was done\r\nby the people of each colony separately and independently of each other,\r\nalthough in union by their delegates for certain specified purposes.\r\nSince the assertion of their independence, the people of the United\r\nStates have never acted otherwise than as the people of each State,\r\nseverally and separately. The Articles of Confederation were established\r\nand ratified by the several States, either through conventions of their\r\npeople or through the State Legislatures. The Constitution which\r\nsuperseded those articles was framed, as we have seen, by delegates\r\nchosen and empowered by the several States, and was ratified by\r\nconventions of the people of the same States--all acting in entire\r\nindependence of one another. This ratification alone gave it force and\r\nvalidity. Without the approval and ratification of the people of the\r\nStates, it would have been, as Mr. Madison expressed it, \"of no more\r\nconsequence than the paper on which it was written.\" It was never\r\nsubmitted to \"the people of the United States in the aggregate,\" or _as\r\na people_. Indeed, no such political community as the people of the\r\nUnited States in the aggregate exists at this day or ever did exist.\r\nSenators in Congress confessedly represent the States as equal units.\r\nThe House of Representatives is not a body of representatives of \"the\r\npeople of the United States,\" as often erroneously asserted; but the\r\nConstitution, in the second section of its first article, expressly\r\ndeclares that it \"shall be composed of members chosen by _the people of\r\nthe several States_.\"\r\n\r\nNor is it true that the President and Vice-President are elected, as it\r\nis sometimes vaguely stated, by vote of the \"whole people\" of the Union.\r\nTheir election is even more unlike what such a vote would be than that\r\nof the representatives, who in numbers at least represent the strength\r\nof their respective States. In the election of President and\r\nVice-President the Constitution (Article II) prescribes that \"_each\r\nState_ shall appoint, in such manner as the Legislature thereof may\r\ndirect, a number of electors\" for the purpose of choosing a President\r\nand Vice-President. The number of these electors is based partly upon\r\nthe equal sovereignty, partly upon the unequal population of the\r\nrespective States.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, absolutely true that there has never been any such thing as\r\na vote of \"the people of the United States in the aggregate\"; no such\r\npeople is recognized by the Constitution; and no such political\r\ncommunity has ever existed. It is equally true that no officer or\r\ndepartment of the General Government formed by the Constitution derives\r\nauthority from a majority of the whole people of the United States, or\r\nhas ever been chosen by such majority. As little as any other is the\r\nUnited States Government a government of a majority of the mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Bancroft's \"History of the United States,\" vol. i, chap.\r\nix.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Bancroft's \"History of the United States,\" vol. i, chap.\r\nix.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: \"American Archives,\" fourth series, vol. i, p. 908.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n    The Preamble to the Constitution.--\"We, the People.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preamble to the Constitution proposed by the Convention of 1787 is\r\nin these words:\r\n\r\n    \"We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more\r\n    perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity,\r\n    provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and\r\n    secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity,\r\n    do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States\r\n    of America.\"\r\n\r\nThe phraseology of this preamble has been generally regarded as the\r\nstronghold of the advocates of consolidation. It has been interpreted as\r\nmeaning that \"we, the people of the United States,\" as a collective\r\nbody, or as a \"nation,\" in our aggregate capacity, had \"ordained and\r\nestablished\" the Constitution _over_ the States.\r\n\r\nThis interpretation constituted, in the beginning, the most serious\r\ndifficulty in the way of the ratification of the Constitution. It was\r\nprobably this to which that sturdy patriot, Samuel Adams, of\r\nMassachusetts, alluded, when he wrote to Richard Henry Lee, \"I stumble\r\nat the threshold.\" Patrick Henry, in the Virginia Convention, on the\r\nthird day of the session, and in the very opening of the debate,\r\nattacked it vehemently. He said, speaking of the system of government\r\nset forth in the proposed Constitution:\r\n\r\n    \"That this is a consolidated government is demonstrably clear;\r\n    and the danger of such a government is, to my mind, very\r\n    striking. I have the highest veneration for those gentlemen [its\r\n    authors]; but, sir, give me leave to demand, What right had they\r\n    to say, _We, the people_? My political curiosity, exclusive of\r\n    my anxious solicitude for the public welfare, leads me to ask,\r\n    Who authorized them to speak the language of '_We, the people_,'\r\n    instead of _We, the States_? States are the characteristics and\r\n    the soul of a confederation. If the States be not the agents of\r\n    this compact, it must be one great consolidated national\r\n    government of the people of all the States.\"[38]\r\n\r\nAgain, on the next day, with reference to the same subject, he said:\r\n\"When I asked that question, I thought the meaning of my interrogation\r\nwas obvious. The fate of this question and of America may depend on\r\nthis. Have they said, We, the States? Have they made a proposal of a\r\ncompact between States? If they had, this would be a confederation: it\r\nis otherwise most clearly a consolidated government. The question turns,\r\nsir, on that poor little thing--the expression, 'We, the people,'\r\ninstead of the States of America.\"[39]\r\n\r\nThe same difficulty arose in other minds and in other conventions.\r\n\r\nThe scruples of Mr. Adams were removed by the explanations of others,\r\nand by the assurance of the adoption of the amendments thought\r\nnecessary--especially of that declaratory safeguard afterward embodied\r\nin the tenth amendment--to be referred to hereafter.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry's objection was thus answered by Mr. Madison:\r\n\r\n    \"Who are parties to it [the Constitution]? The people--but _not\r\n    the people as composing one great body_; but the people as\r\n    composing _thirteen sovereignties_: were it, as the gentleman\r\n    [Mr. Henry] asserts, a consolidated government, the assent of a\r\n    majority of the people would be sufficient for its\r\n    establishment, and as a majority have adopted it already, the\r\n    remaining States would be bound by the act of the majority, even\r\n    if they unanimously reprobated it: were it such a government as\r\n    is suggested, it would be now binding on the people of this\r\n    State, without having had the privilege of deliberating upon it;\r\n    but, sir, no State is bound by it, as it is, without its own\r\n    consent. Should all the States adopt it, it will be then a\r\n    government established by the thirteen States of America, not\r\n    through the intervention of the Legislatures, but by the people\r\n    at large. In this particular respect the distinction between the\r\n    existing and proposed governments is very material. The existing\r\n    system has been derived from the dependent, derivative authority\r\n    of the Legislatures of the States, whereas this is derived from\r\n    the superior power of the people.\"[40]\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that this was spoken by one of the leading members\r\nof the Convention which formed the Constitution, within a few months\r\nafter that instrument was drawn up. Mr. Madison's hearers could readily\r\nappreciate his clear answer to the objection made. The \"people\" intended\r\nwere those of the respective States--the only organized communities of\r\npeople exercising sovereign powers of government; and the idea intended\r\nwas the ratification and \"establishment\" of the Constitution by direct\r\nact of the people in their conventions, instead of by act of their\r\nLegislatures, as in the adoption of the Articles of Confederation. The\r\nexplanation seems to have been as satisfactory as it was simple and\r\nintelligible. Mr. Henry, although he fought to the last against the\r\nratification of the Constitution, did not again bring forward this\r\nobjection, for the reason, no doubt, that it had been fully answered.\r\nIndeed, we hear no more of the interpretation which suggested it, from\r\nthat period, for nearly half a century, when it was revived, and has\r\nsince been employed, to sustain that theory of a \"great consolidated\r\nnational government\" which Mr. Madison so distinctly repudiated.\r\n\r\nBut _we_ have access to sources of information, not then available,\r\nwhich make the intent and meaning of the Constitution still plainer.\r\nWhen Mr. Henry made his objection, and Mr. Madison answered it, the\r\njournal of the Philadelphia Convention had not been published. That body\r\nhad sat with closed doors, and among its rules had been the following:\r\n\r\n    \"That no copy be taken of any entry on the journal during the\r\n    sitting of the House, without the leave of the House.\r\n\r\n    \"That members only be permitted to inspect the journal.\r\n\r\n    \"That nothing spoken in the House be printed, or otherwise\r\n    published or communicated, without leave.\"[41]\r\n\r\nWe can understand, by reference to these rules, how Mr. Madison should\r\nhave felt precluded from making allusion to anything that had occurred\r\nduring the proceedings of the Convention. But the secrecy then covering\r\nthose proceedings has long since been removed. The manuscript journal,\r\nwhich was intrusted to the keeping of General Washington, President of\r\nthe Convention, was deposited by him, nine years afterward, among the\r\narchives of the State Department. It has since been published, and we\r\ncan trace for ourselves the origin, and ascertain the exact\r\nsignificance, of that expression, \"We, the people,\" on which Patrick\r\nHenry thought the fate of America might depend, and which has been so\r\ngrossly perverted in later years from its true intent.\r\n\r\nThe original language of the preamble, reported to the Convention by a\r\ncommittee of five appointed to prepare the Constitution, as we find it\r\nin the proceedings of August 6, 1787, was as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"We, the people of the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\n    Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York,\r\n    New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North\r\n    Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, do ordain, declare, and\r\n    establish, the following Constitution for the government of\r\n    ourselves and our posterity.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no question here what was meant: it was \"_the people of the\r\nStates_,\" designated by name, that were to \"ordain, declare, and\r\nestablish\" the compact of union for themselves and their posterity.\r\nThere is no ambiguity nor uncertainty in the language; nor was there any\r\ndifference in the Convention as to the use of it. The preamble, as\r\nperfected, was submitted to vote on the next day, and, as the journal\r\ninforms us, \"it passed _unanimously_ in the affirmative.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no subsequent change of opinion on the subject. The reason for\r\nthe modification afterward made in the language is obvious. It was found\r\nthat unanimous ratification of all the States could not be expected, and\r\nit was determined, as we have already seen, that the consent of _nine_\r\nStates should suffice for the establishment of the new compact \"between\r\nthe States so ratifying the same.\" _Any_ nine would be sufficient to put\r\nthe proposed government in operation as to them, thus leaving the\r\nremainder of the thirteen to pursue such course as might be to each\r\npreferable. When this conclusion was reached, it became manifestly\r\nimpracticable to designate beforehand the consenting States by name.\r\nHence, in the final revision, the specific enumeration of the thirteen\r\nStates was omitted, and the equivalent phrase \"people of the United\r\nStates\" inserted in its place--plainly meaning the people of such States\r\nas should agree to unite on the terms proposed. The imposing fabric of\r\npolitical delusion, which has been erected on the basis of this simple\r\ntransaction, disappears before the light of historical record.\r\n\r\nCould the authors of the Constitution have foreseen the perversion to be\r\nmade of their obvious meaning, it might have been prevented by an easy\r\nperiphrasis--such as, \"We, the people of the States hereby united,\" or\r\nsomething to the same effect. The word \"people\" in 1787, as in 1880,\r\nwas, as it is, a collective noun, employed indiscriminately, either as a\r\nunit in such expressions as \"this people,\" \"a free people,\" etc., or in\r\na distributive sense, as applied to the citizens or inhabitants of one\r\nstate or country or a number of states or countries. When the Convention\r\nof the colony of Virginia, in 1774, instructed their delegates to the\r\nCongress that was to meet in Philadelphia, \"to obtain a redress of those\r\ngrievances, without which _the people of America_ can neither be safe,\r\nfree, nor happy,\" it was certainly not intended to convey the idea that\r\nthe people of the American Continent, or even of the British colonies in\r\nAmerica, constituted one political community. Nor did Edmund Burke have\r\nany such meaning when he said, in his celebrated speech in Parliament,\r\nin 1775, \"The people of the colonies are descendants of Englishmen.\"\r\n\r\nWe need go no further than to the familiar language of King James's\r\ntranslation of the Bible for multiplied illustrations of this\r\nindiscriminate use of the term, both in its collective and distributive\r\nsenses. For example, King Solomon prays at the dedication of the temple:\r\n\r\n    \"That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication ... of _thy\r\n    people_ Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for\r\n    unto thee. For thou didst separate them from among _all the\r\n    people_ of the earth, to be thine inheritance.\" (1 Kings viii,\r\n    52, 53.)\r\n\r\nHere we have both the singular and plural senses of the same word--_one\r\npeople_, Israel, and _all the people of the earth_--in two consecutive\r\nsentences. In \"the people of the earth,\" the word _people_ is used\r\nprecisely as it is in the expression \"the people of the United States\"\r\nin the preamble to the Constitution, and has exactly the same force and\r\neffect. If in the latter case it implies that the people of\r\nMassachusetts and those of Virginia were mere fractional parts of one\r\npolitical community, it must in the former imply a like unity among the\r\nPhilistines, the Egyptians, the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians,\r\nand all other \"people of the earth,\" except the Israelites. Scores of\r\nexamples of the same sort might be cited if it were necessary.[42]\r\n\r\nIn the Declaration of Independence we find precisely analogous instances\r\nof the employment of the singular form for both singular and plural\r\nsenses--\"one people,\" \"a free people,\" in the former, and \"the good\r\npeople of these colonies\" in the latter. Judge Story, in the excess of\r\nhis zeal in behalf of a theory of consolidation, bases upon this last\r\nexpression the conclusion that the assertion of independence was the act\r\nof \"_the whole people_ of the united colonies\" as a unit; overlooking or\r\nsuppressing the fact that, in the very same sentence, the colonies\r\ndeclare themselves \"free and independent _States_\"--not a free and\r\nindependent _state_--repeating the words \"independent States\" three\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the Declaration of Independence constituted one \"_whole\r\npeople_\" of the colonies, then that geographical section of it, formerly\r\nknown as the colony of Maryland, was in a state of revolt or \"rebellion\"\r\nagainst the others, as well as against Great Britain, from 1778 to 1781,\r\nduring which period Maryland refused to ratify or be bound by the\r\nArticles of Confederation, which, according to this theory, was binding\r\nupon her, as a majority of the \"whole people\" had adopted it. _A\r\nfortiori_, North Carolina and Rhode Island were in a state of rebellion\r\nin 1789-'90, while they declined to ratify and recognize the\r\nConstitution adopted by the other eleven fractions of this united\r\npeople. Yet no hint of any such pretension--of any claim of authority\r\nover them by the majority--of any assertion of \"the supremacy of the\r\nUnion\"--is to be found in any of the records of that period.\r\n\r\nIt might have been unnecessary to bestow so much time and attention in\r\nexposing the absurdity of the deductions from a theory so false, but for\r\nthe fact that it has been specious enough to secure the countenance of\r\nmen of such distinction as Webster, Story, and Everett; and that it has\r\nbeen made the plea to justify a bloody war against that principle of\r\nState sovereignty and independence, which was regarded by the fathers of\r\nthe Union as the corner-stone of the structure and the basis of the hope\r\nfor its perpetuity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Elliott's \"Debates\" (Washington edition, 1836), vol. iii,\r\np. 54.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Ibid., p. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Elliott's \"Debates\" (Washington edition, 1836), vol. iii,\r\npp. 114, 115.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Journal of the Federal Convention, May 29, 1787, 1\r\nElliott's \"Debates.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: For a very striking illustration, see Deuteronomy vii, 6,\r\n7.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n    The Preamble to the Constitution--subject continued.--Growth of\r\n    the Federal Government and Accretions of Power.--Revival of Old\r\n    Errors.--Mistakes and Misstatements.--Webster, Story, and\r\n    Everett.--Who \"ordained and established\" the Constitution?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the progressive growth of the Government of the United States in\r\npower, splendor, patronage, and consideration abroad, men have been led\r\nto exalt the place of the _Government_ above that of the _States_ which\r\n_created_ it. Those who would understand the true principles of the\r\nConstitution can not afford to lose sight of the essential _plurality_\r\nof idea invariably implied in the term \"United States,\" wherever it is\r\nused in that instrument. No such unit as the United States is ever\r\nmentioned therein. We read that \"no title of nobility shall be granted\r\nby the United States, and no person holding any office of profit or\r\ntrust under _them_ shall, without the consent of Congress, accept,\"\r\netc.[43] \"The President ... shall not receive, within that period, any\r\nother emolument from the United States, or any of _them_.\"[44] \"The laws\r\nof the United States, and treaties made or which shall be made under\r\n_their_ authority,\" etc.[45] \"Treason against the United States shall\r\nconsist only in levying war against _them_, or in adhering to _their_\r\nenemies.\"[46] The Federal character of the Union is expressed by this\r\nvery phraseology, which recognizes the distinct integrity of its\r\nmembers, not as fractional parts of one great unit, but as component\r\nunits of an association. So clear was this to contemporaries, that it\r\nneeded only to be pointed out to satisfy their scruples. We have seen\r\nhow effectual was the answer of Mr. Madison to the objections raised by\r\nPatrick Henry. Mr. Tench Coxe, of Pennsylvania, one of the ablest\r\npolitical writers of his generation, in answering a similar objection,\r\nsaid: \"If the Federal Convention had meant to exclude the idea of\r\n'union'--that is, of several and separate sovereignties joining in a\r\nconfederacy--they would have said, 'We, the people of America'; for\r\nunion necessarily involves the idea of competent States, which complete\r\nconsolidation excludes.\"[47]\r\n\r\nMore than forty years afterward, when the gradual accretions to the\r\npower, _prestige_, and influence of the central Government had grown to\r\nsuch extent as to begin to hide from view the purposes for which it was\r\nfounded, those very objections, which in the beginning had been\r\nanswered, abandoned, and thrown aside, were brought to light again, and\r\npresented to the country as expositions of the true meaning of the\r\nConstitution. Mr. Webster, one of the first to revive some of those\r\nearly misconceptions so long ago refuted as to be almost forgotten, and\r\nto breathe into them such renewed vitality as his commanding genius\r\ncould impart, in the course of his well-known debate in the Senate with\r\nMr. Hayne, in 1830, said:\r\n\r\n    \"It can not be shown that the Constitution is a compact between\r\n    State governments. The Constitution itself, in its very front,\r\n    refutes that proposition: it declares that it is ordained and\r\n    established by the people of the United States. So far from\r\n    saying that it is established by the governments of the several\r\n    States, it does not even say that it is established by the\r\n    people of the several States; but it pronounces that it is\r\n    established by the people of the United States in the\r\n    aggregate.\"[48]\r\n\r\nJudge Story about the same time began to advance the same theory, but\r\nmore guardedly and with less rashness of statement. It was not until\r\nthirty years after that it attained its full development in the\r\nannunciations of sectionists rather than statesmen. Two such may suffice\r\nas specimens:\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Everett, in his address delivered on the 4th of July, 1861,\r\nand already referred to, says of the Constitution: \"That instrument does\r\nnot purport to be a 'compact,' but a constitution of government. It\r\nappears, in its first sentence, not to have been entered into by the\r\nStates, but to have been ordained and established by the people of the\r\nUnited States for themselves and their 'posterity.' The States are not\r\nnamed in it; nearly all the characteristic powers of sovereignty are\r\nexpressly granted to the General Government and expressly prohibited to\r\nthe States.\"[49] Mr. Everett afterward repeats the assertion that \"the\r\nStates are not named in it.\"[50]\r\n\r\nBut a yet more extraordinary statement of the \"one people\" theory is\r\nfound in a letter addressed to the London \"Times,\" in the same year,\r\n1861, on the \"Causes of the Civil War,\" by Mr. John Lothrop Motley,\r\nafterward Minister to the Court of St. James. In this letter Mr. Motley\r\nsays of the Constitution of the United States:\r\n\r\n    \"It was not a compact. Who ever heard of a compact to which\r\n    there were no parties? or who ever heard of a compact made by a\r\n    single party with himself? Yet the name of no State is mentioned\r\n    in the whole document; the States themselves are only mentioned\r\n    to receive commands or prohibitions; and the 'people of the\r\n    United States' is the single party by whom alone the instrument\r\n    is executed.\r\n\r\n    \"The Constitution was not drawn up by the States, it was not\r\n    promulgated in the name of the States, it was not ratified by\r\n    the States. The States never acceded to it, and possess no power\r\n    to secede from it. It was 'ordained and established' over the\r\n    States by a power superior to the States; by the people of the\r\n    whole land in their aggregate capacity,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIt would be very hard to condense a more amazing amount of audacious and\r\nreckless falsehood in the same space. In all Mr. Motley's array of bold\r\nassertions, there is not one single truth--unless it be, perhaps, that\r\n\"the Constitution was not drawn up by the States.\" Yet it was drawn up\r\nby their delegates, and it is of such material as this, derived from\r\nwriters whose reputation gives a semblance of authenticity to their\r\nstatements, that history is constructed and transmitted.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable--though, perhaps, the least important--of\r\nthese misstatements is that which is also twice repeated by Mr.\r\nEverett--that the name of no State is mentioned in the whole document,\r\nor, as he puts it, \"the States are not named in it.\" Very little careful\r\nexamination would have sufficed to find, in the second section of the\r\nvery first article of the Constitution, the names of every one of the\r\nthirteen then existent States distinctly mentioned, with the number of\r\nrepresentatives to which each would be entitled, in case of acceding to\r\nthe Constitution, until a census of their population could be taken. The\r\nmention there made of the States by name is of no special significance;\r\nit has no bearing upon any question of principle; and the denial of it\r\nis a purely gratuitous illustration of the recklessness of those from\r\nwhom it proceeds, and the low estimate put on the intelligence of those\r\naddressed. It serves, however, to show how much credence is to be given\r\nto their authority as interpreters and expounders.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the names of the ratifying States were not mentioned has\r\nalready been given: it was simply because it was not known which States\r\nwould ratify. But, as regards mention of \"the several States,\" \"each\r\nState,\" \"any State,\" \"particular States,\" and the like, the Constitution\r\nis full of it. I am informed, by one who has taken the pains to examine\r\ncarefully that document with reference to this very point, that--without\r\nincluding any mention of \"the United States\" or of \"foreign states,\" and\r\nexcluding also the amendments--the Constitution, in its original draft,\r\nmakes mention of the States, _as_ States, no less than _seventy_ times;\r\nand of these seventy times, only _three_ times in the way of prohibition\r\nof the exercise of a power. In fact, it is full of statehood. Leave out\r\nall mention of the States--I make no mere verbal point or quibble, but\r\nmean the States in their separate, several, distinct capacity--and what\r\nwould remain would be of less account than the play of the Prince of\r\nDenmark with the part of _Hamlet_ omitted.\r\n\r\nBut, leaving out of consideration for the moment all minor questions,\r\nthe vital and essential point of inquiry now is, by what authority the\r\nConstitution was \"ordained and established.\" Mr. Webster says it was\r\ndone \"by the people of the United States in the aggregate;\" Mr. Everett\r\nrepeats substantially the same thing; and Mr. Motley, taking a step\r\nfurther, says that \"it was 'ordained and established' by a _power\r\nsuperior to the States_--by the people of the whole land in their\r\naggregate capacity.\"\r\n\r\nThe advocates of this mischievous dogma assume the existence of an\r\nunauthorized, undefined power of a \"whole people,\" or \"people of the\r\nwhole land,\" operating through the agency of the Philadelphia\r\nConvention, to impose its decrees upon the States. They forget, in the\r\nfirst place, that this Convention was composed of delegates, not of any\r\none people, but of distinct States; and, in the second place, that their\r\naction had no force or validity whatever--in the words of Mr. Madison,\r\nthat it was of no more consequence than the paper on which it was\r\nwritten--until approved and ratified by a sufficient number of States.\r\nThe meaning of the preamble, \"We, the people of the United States ... do\r\nordain and establish this Constitution,\" is ascertained, fixed, and\r\ndefined by the final article: \"The ratification of the conventions of\r\n_nine States_ shall be sufficient for the _establishment_ of this\r\nConstitution between _the States so ratifying_ the same.\" If it was\r\nalready established, what need was there of further establishment? It\r\nwas not ordained or established at all, until ratified by the requisite\r\nnumber of States. The announcement in the preamble of course had\r\nreference to that expected ratification, without which the preamble\r\nwould have been as void as the body of the instrument. The assertion\r\nthat \"it was not ratified by the States\" is so plainly and positively\r\ncontrary, to well-known fact--so inconsistent with the language of the\r\nConstitution itself--that it is hard to imagine what was intended by it,\r\nunless it was to take advantage of the presumed ignorance of the subject\r\namong the readers of an English journal, to impose upon them, a\r\npreposterous fiction. It was State ratification alone--the ratification\r\nof the _people_ of each State, independently of all other people--that\r\ngave force, vitality, and validity to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nJudge Story, referring to the fact that the voters assembled in the\r\nseveral States, asks where else they could have assembled--a pertinent\r\nquestion on our theory, but the idea he evidently intended to convey was\r\nthat the voting of \"the people\" by States was a mere matter of\r\ngeographical necessity, or local convenience; just as the people of a\r\nState vote by counties; the people of a county by towns, \"beats,\" or\r\n\"precincts\"; and the people of a city by wards. It is hardly necessary\r\nto say that, in all organized republican communities, majorities govern.\r\nWhen we speak of the will of the people of a community, we mean the will\r\nof a majority, which, when constitutionally expressed, is binding on any\r\nminority of the same community.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we can conceive, and admit for a moment, the possibility that,\r\nwhen the Constitution was under consideration, the people of the United\r\nStates were politically \"one people\"--a collective unit--two deductions\r\nare clearly inevitable: In the first place, each geographical division\r\nof this great community would have been entitled to vote according to\r\nits relative population; and, in the second, the expressed will of the\r\nlegal majority would have been binding upon the whole. A denial of the\r\nfirst proposition would be a denial of common justice and equal rights;\r\na denial of the second would be to destroy all government and establish\r\nmere anarchy.\r\n\r\nNow, _neither_ of these principles was practiced or proposed or even\r\nimagined in the case of the action of the people of the United States\r\n(if they were one political community) upon the proposed Constitution.\r\nOn the contrary, seventy thousand people in the State of Delaware had\r\nprecisely the same weight--one vote--in its ratification, as seven\r\nhundred thousand (and more) in Virginia, or four hundred thousand in\r\nPennsylvania. Would not this have been an intolerable grievance and\r\nwrong--would no protest have been uttered against it--if these had been\r\nfractional parts of one community of people?\r\n\r\nAgain, while the will of the consenting majority _within_ any State was\r\nbinding on the opposing minority in the same, no majority, or\r\nmajorities, of States or people had any control whatever upon the people\r\nof _another_ State. The Constitution was established, not \"_over_ the\r\nStates,\" as asserted by Motley, but \"_between_ the States,\" and only\r\n\"between _the States so ratifying_ the same.\" Little Rhode Island, with\r\nher seventy thousand inhabitants, was not a mere fractional part of \"the\r\npeople of the whole land,\" during the period for which she held aloof,\r\nbut was as free, independent, and unmolested, as any other sovereign\r\npower, notwithstanding the majority of more than three millions of \"the\r\nwhole people\" on the other side of the question.\r\n\r\nBefore the ratification of the Constitution--when there was some excuse\r\nfor an imperfect understanding or misconception of the terms\r\nproposed--Mr. Madison thus answered, in advance, the objections made on\r\nthe ground of this misconception, and demonstrated its fallacy. He\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n    \"That it will be a federal and not a national act, as these\r\n    terms are understood by objectors--the act of the people, as\r\n    forming so many independent States, not as forming one aggregate\r\n    nation--is obvious from this single consideration, that it is to\r\n    result neither from the decision of a _majority_ of the people\r\n    of the Union nor from that of a _majority_ of _the States_. It\r\n    must result from the _unanimous_ assent of the several _States\r\n    that are parties to it_, differing no otherwise from their\r\n    ordinary assent than in its being expressed, not by the\r\n    legislative authority, but by that of the people themselves.\r\n    Were the people regarded in this transaction as forming one\r\n    nation, the will of the majority of the whole people of the\r\n    United States would bind the minority, in the same manner as the\r\n    majority in each State must bind the minority; and the will of\r\n    the majority must be determined either by a comparison of the\r\n    individual votes or by considering the will of the majority of\r\n    the States as evidence of the will of a majority of the people\r\n    of the United States. Neither of these has been adopted. Each\r\n    State, in ratifying the Constitution, is considered as a\r\n    sovereign body, independent of all others, and only to be bound\r\n    by its own voluntary act.\"[51]\r\n\r\nIt is a tedious task to have to expose the misstatements, both of fact\r\nand of principle, which have occupied so much attention, but it is\r\nrendered necessary by the extent to which they have been imposed upon\r\nthe acceptance of the public, through reckless assertion and confident\r\nand incessant repetition.\r\n\r\n    \"'I remember,' says Mr. Webster, 'to have heard Chief-Justice\r\n    Marshall ask counsel, who was insisting upon the authority of an\r\n    act of legislation, _if he thought an act of legislation could\r\n    create or destroy a fact, or change the truth of history_?\r\n    \"Would it alter the fact,\" said he, \"if a Legislature should\r\n    solemnly enact that Mr. Hume never wrote the History of\r\n    England?\" A Legislature may alter the law,' continues Mr.\r\n    Webster, 'but no power can reverse a fact.' Hence, if the\r\n    Convention of 1787 had expressly declared that the Constitution\r\n    was [to be] ordained by 'the people of the United States _in the\r\n    aggregate_,' or by the people of America as one nation, this\r\n    would not have destroyed the fact that it was ratified by each\r\n    State for itself, and that each State was bound only by 'its own\r\n    voluntary act.'\" (Bledsoe.)\r\n\r\nBut the Convention, as we have seen, said no such thing. No such\r\ncommunity as \"the people of the United States in the aggregate\" is known\r\nto it, or ever acted on it. It was ordained, established, and ratified\r\nby the people of the several States; and no theories or assertions of a\r\nlater generation can change or conceal this fixed fact, as it stands\r\nrevealed in the light of contemporaneous records.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Article I, section 9, clause 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Article II, section 1, clause 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: Article III, section 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Article III, section 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: \"American Museum,\" February, 1788.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: Benton's \"Abridgment,\" vol. x, p. 448.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: See address by Edward Everett at the Academy of Music, New\r\nYork, July 4, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: \"Federalist,\" No. xxxix.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n    Verbal Cavils and Criticisms.--\"Compact,\" \"Confederacy,\"\r\n    \"Accession,\" etc.--The \"New Vocabulary.\"--The Federal\r\n    Constitution a Compact, and the States acceded to it.--Evidence\r\n    of the Constitution itself and of Contemporary Records.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have habitually spoken of the Federal Constitution as a compact, and\r\nof the parties to it as sovereign States. These terms should not, and in\r\nearlier times would not, have required explanation or vindication. But\r\nthey have been called in question by the modern school of consolidation.\r\nThese gentlemen admit that the Government under the Articles of\r\nConfederation was a compact. Mr. Webster, in his rejoinder to Mr. Hayne,\r\non the 27th of January, 1830, said:\r\n\r\n    \"When the gentleman says the Constitution is a compact between\r\n    the States, he uses language exactly applicable to the old\r\n    Confederation. He speaks as if he were in Congress before 1789.\r\n    He describes fully that old state of things then existing. The\r\n    Confederation was, in strictness, a compact; the States, as\r\n    States, were parties to it. We had no other General Government.\r\n    But that was found insufficient and inadequate to the public\r\n    exigencies. The people were not satisfied with it, and undertook\r\n    to establish a better. They undertook to form a General\r\n    Government, which should stand on a new basis--not a\r\n    confederacy, not a league, not a compact between States, but a\r\n    Constitution.\"[52]\r\n\r\nAgain, in his discussion with Mr. Calhoun, three years afterward, he\r\nvehemently reiterates the same denial. Of the Constitution, he says:\r\n\"Does it call itself a compact? Certainly not. It uses the word\r\n'compact' but once, and that when it declares that the States shall\r\nenter into no compact.[53] Does it call itself a league, a confederacy,\r\na subsisting treaty between the States? Certainly not. There is not a\r\nparticle of such language in all its pages.\"[54]\r\n\r\nThe artist, who wrote under his picture the legend \"This is a horse,\"\r\nmade effectual provision against any such cavil as that preferred by Mr.\r\nWebster and his followers, that the Constitution is not a compact,\r\nbecause it is not \"so nominated in the bond.\" As well as I can\r\nrecollect, there is no passage in the \"Iliad\" or the \"Æneid\" in which\r\neither of those great works \"calls itself,\" or is called by its author,\r\nan epic poem, yet this would scarcely be accepted as evidence that they\r\nare not epic poems. In an examination of Mr. Webster's remarks, I do not\r\nfind that he announces them to be either a speech or an argument; yet\r\ntheir claim to both these titles will hardly be disputed--\r\nnotwithstanding the verbal criticism on the Constitution just quoted.\r\n\r\nThe distinction attempted to be drawn between the language proper to a\r\nconfederation and that belonging to a constitution, as indicating two\r\ndifferent ideas, will not bear the test of examination and application\r\nto the case of the United States. It has been fully shown, in previous\r\nchapters, that the terms \"Union,\" \"Federal Union,\" \"Federal\r\nConstitution,\" \"Constitution of the Federal Government,\" and the like,\r\nwere used--not merely in colloquial, informal speech, but in public\r\nproceedings and official documents--with reference to the Articles of\r\nConfederation, as freely as they have since been employed under the\r\npresent Constitution. The former Union was--as Mr. Webster expressly\r\nadmits--as nobody denies--a compact between States, yet it nowhere\r\n\"calls itself\" \"a compact\"; the word does not occur in it even the one\r\ntime that it occurs in the present Constitution, although the\r\ncontracting States are in both prohibited from entering into any\r\n\"treaty, confederation, or alliance\" with one another, or with any\r\nforeign power, without the consent of Congress; and the contracting or\r\nconstituent parties are termed \"United States\" in the one just as in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster is particularly unfortunate in his criticisms upon what he\r\nterms the \"new vocabulary,\" in which the Constitution is styled a\r\ncompact, and the States which ratified it are spoken of as having\r\n\"acceded\" to it. In the same speech, last quoted, he says:\r\n\r\n    \"This word 'accede,' not found either in the Constitution itself\r\n    or in the ratification of it by any one of the States, has been\r\n    chosen for use here, doubtless not without a well-considered\r\n    purpose. The natural converse of accession is secession; and\r\n    therefore, when it is stated that the people of the States\r\n    acceded to the Union, it may be more plausibly argued that they\r\n    may secede from it. If, in adopting the Constitution, nothing\r\n    was done but acceding to a compact, nothing would seem\r\n    necessary, in order to break it up, but to secede from the same\r\n    compact. But the term is wholly out of place. Accession, as a\r\n    word applied to political associations, implies coming into a\r\n    league, treaty, or confederacy, by one hitherto a stranger to\r\n    it; and secession implies departing from such league or\r\n    confederacy. The people of the United States have used no such\r\n    form of expression in establishing the present Government.\"[55]\r\n\r\nRepeating and reiterating in many forms what is substantially the same\r\nidea, and attributing the use of the terms which he attacks to an\r\nulterior purpose, Mr. Webster says:\r\n\r\n    \"This is the reason, sir, which makes it necessary to abandon\r\n    the use of constitutional language for a new vocabulary, and to\r\n    substitute, in the place of plain, historical facts, a series of\r\n    assumptions. This is the reason why it is necessary to give new\r\n    names to things; to speak of the Constitution, not as a\r\n    constitution, but as a compact; and of the ratifications by the\r\n    people, not as ratifications, but as acts of accession.\"[56]\r\n\r\nIn these and similar passages, Mr. Webster virtually concedes that, if\r\nthe Constitution _were_ a compact; if the Union _were_ a confederacy; if\r\nthe States _had_, as States, severally acceded to it--all which\r\npropositions he denies--then the sovereignty of the States and their\r\nright to secede from the Union would be deducible.\r\n\r\nNow, it happens that these very terms--\"compact,\" \"confederacy,\"\r\n\"accede,\" and the like--were the terms in familiar use by the authors of\r\nthe Constitution and their associates with reference to that instrument\r\nand its ratification. Other writers, who have examined the subject since\r\nthe late war gave it an interest which it had never commanded before,\r\nhave collected such an array of evidence in this behalf that it is\r\nnecessary only to cite a few examples.\r\n\r\nThe following language of Mr. Gerry, of Massachusetts, in the Convention\r\nof 1787, has already been referred to: \"If nine out of thirteen States\r\ncan dissolve _the compact_, six out of nine will be just as able to\r\ndissolve _the new one_ hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gouverneur Morris, one of the most pronounced advocates of a strong\r\ncentral government, in the Convention, said: \"He came here to form _a\r\ncompact_ for the good of Americans. He was ready to do so with all the\r\nStates. He hoped and believed they all would enter into such a\r\n_compact_. If they would not, he would be ready to join with any States\r\nthat would. But, as the _compact_ was to be voluntary, it is in vain for\r\nthe Eastern States to insist on what the Southern States will never\r\nagree to.\"[57]\r\n\r\nMr. Madison, while inclining to a strong government, said: \"In the case\r\nof a union of people under one Constitution, the nature of _the pact_\r\nhas always been understood,\" etc.[58]\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton, in the \"Federalist,\" repeatedly speaks of the new\r\ngovernment as a \"_confederate republic_\" and a \"_confederacy_,\" and\r\ncalls the Constitution a \"compact.\" (See especially Nos. IX. and LXXXV.)\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington--who was not only the first President under the new\r\nConstitution, but who had presided over the Convention that drew it\r\nup--in letters written soon after the adjournment of that body to\r\nfriends in various States, referred to the Constitution as a _compact_\r\nor treaty, and repeatedly uses the terms \"accede\" and \"accession,\" and\r\nonce the term \"secession.\"\r\n\r\nHe asks what the opponents of the Constitution in Virginia would do, \"if\r\nnine other States should _accede_ to the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nLuther Martin, of Maryland, informs us that, in a committee of the\r\nGeneral Convention of 1787, protesting against the proposed violation of\r\nthe principles of the \"perpetual union\" already formed under the\r\nArticles of Confederation, he made use of such language as this:\r\n\r\n    \"Will you tell us we ought to trust you because you now enter\r\n    into a solemn _compact_ with us? This you have done before, and\r\n    now treat with the utmost contempt. Will you now make an appeal\r\n    to the Supreme Being, and call on Him to guarantee your\r\n    observance of this _compact_? The same you have formerly done\r\n    for your observance of the Articles of Confederation, which you\r\n    are now violating in the most wanton manner.\"[59]\r\n\r\nIt is needless to multiply the proofs that abound in the writings of the\r\n\"fathers\" to show that Mr. Webster's \"new vocabulary\" was the very\r\nlanguage they familiarly used. Let two more examples suffice, from\r\nauthority higher than that of any individual speaker or writer, however\r\neminent--from authority second only, if at all inferior, to that of the\r\ntext of the Constitution itself--that is, from the acts or ordinances of\r\nratification by the States. They certainly ought to have been\r\nconclusive, and should not have been unknown to Mr. Webster, for they\r\nare the language of Massachusetts, the State which he represented in the\r\nSenate, and of New Hampshire, the State of his nativity.\r\n\r\nThe ratification of Massachusetts is expressed in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    \"COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n    \"The Convention, having impartially discussed and fully\r\n    considered a Constitution for the United States of America,\r\n    reported to Congress by the convention of delegates from the\r\n    United States of America, and submitted to us by a resolution of\r\n    the General Court of the said Commonwealth, passed the 25th day\r\n    of October last past, and acknowledging with grateful hearts the\r\n    goodness of the Supreme Ruler of the universe, in affording the\r\n    people of the United States, in the course of his Providence, an\r\n    opportunity, deliberately and peaceably, without fraud or\r\n    surprise, of entering into an explicit and solemn COMPACT with\r\n    each other, by assenting to and ratifying a new Constitution, in\r\n    order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure\r\n    domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote\r\n    the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to\r\n    themselves and their posterity--do, in the name and in behalf of\r\n    the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, assent to and\r\n    ratify the said Constitution for the United States of America.\"\r\n\r\nThe ratification of New Hampshire is expressed in precisely the same\r\nwords, save only the difference of date of the resolution of the\r\nLegislature (or \"General Court\") referred to, and also the use of the\r\nword \"State\" instead of \"Commonwealth.\" Both distinctly accept it as a\r\n_compact_ of the States \"with each other\"--which Mr. Webster, a son of\r\nNew Hampshire and a Senator from Massachusetts, declared it was not; and\r\nnot only so, but he repudiated the very \"vocabulary\" from which the\r\nwords expressing the doctrine were taken.\r\n\r\nIt would not need, however, this abounding wealth of contemporaneous\r\nexposition--it does not require the employment of any particular words\r\nin the Constitution--to prove that it was drawn up as a compact between\r\nsovereign States entering into a confederacy with each other, and that\r\nthey ratified and acceded to it separately, severally, and\r\nindependently. The very structure of the whole instrument and the facts\r\nattending its preparation and ratification would suffice. The language\r\nof the final article would have been quite enough: \"The ratification of\r\nthe conventions of nine States shall be sufficient for the establishment\r\nof this Constitution between the States so ratifying the same.\" This is\r\nnot the \"language\" of a superior imposing a mandate upon subordinates.\r\nThe consent of the contracting parties is necessary to its validity, and\r\nthen it becomes not the acceptance and recognition of an authority\r\n\"_over_\" them--as Mr. Motley represents--but of a compact _between_\r\nthem. The simple word \"between\" is incompatible with any other idea than\r\nthat of a compact by independent parties.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible that any doubt could still exist, there is one\r\nprovision in the Constitution which stamps its character as a compact\r\ntoo plainly for cavil or question. The Constitution, which had already\r\nprovided for the representation of the States in both Houses of\r\nCongress, thereby bringing the matter of representation within the power\r\nof amendment, in its fifth article contains a stipulation that \"no\r\nState, without its [own] consent, shall be deprived of its equal\r\nsuffrage in the Senate.\" If this is not a compact between the States,\r\nthe smaller States have no guarantee for the preservation of their\r\nequality of representation in the United States Senate. If the\r\nobligation of a contract does not secure it, the guarantee itself is\r\nliable to amendment, and may be swept away at the will of three fourths\r\nof the States, without wrong to any party--for, according to this\r\ntheory, there is no party of the second part.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: Gales and Seaton's \"Register of Congressional Debates,\"\r\nvol. vi, Part I, p. 93.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: The words \"with another State or with a foreign power\"\r\nshould have been added to make this statement accurate.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: \"Congressional Debates,\" vol. ix, Part I, p. 563.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: \"Congressional Debates,\" vol. ix, Part I, p. 566.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Ibid., pp. 557, 558.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: \"Madison Papers,\" pp. 1081, 1082.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Ibid., p. 1184.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Luther Martin's \"Genuine Information,\" in Wilbur Curtiss's\r\n\"Secret Proceedings and Debates of the Convention,\" p. 29.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n    Sovereignty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The term 'sovereign' or 'sovereignty,'\" says Judge Story, \"is used in\r\ndifferent senses, which often leads to a confusion of ideas, and\r\nsometimes to very mischievous and unfounded conclusions.\" Without any\r\ndisrespect for Judge Story, or any disparagement of his great learning\r\nand ability, it may safely be added that he and his disciples have\r\ncontributed not a little to the increase of this confusion of ideas and\r\nthe spread of these mischievous and unfounded conclusions. There is no\r\ngood reason whatever why it should be used in different senses, or why\r\nthere should be any confusion of ideas as to its meaning. Of all the\r\nterms employed in political science, it is one of the most definite and\r\nintelligible. The definition of it given by that accurate and lucid\r\npublicist, Burlamaqui, is simple and satisfactory--that \"sovereignty is\r\na right of commanding in the last resort in civil society.\"[60] The\r\noriginal seat of this sovereignty he also declares to be in the people.\r\n\"But,\" he adds, \"when once the people have transferred their right to a\r\nsovereign [i.e., a monarch], they can not, without contradiction, be\r\nsupposed to continue still masters of it.\"[61] This is in strict accord\r\nwith the theory of American republicanism, the peculiarity of which is\r\nthat the people _never do_ transfer their right of sovereignty, either\r\nin whole or in part. They only delegate to their governments the\r\nexercise of such of its functions as may be necessary, subject always to\r\ntheir own control, and to reassumption whenever such government fails to\r\nfulfill the purposes for which it was instituted.\r\n\r\nI think it has already been demonstrated that, in this country, the only\r\npolitical community--the only independent corporate unit through which\r\nthe people can exercise their sovereignty, is the State. Minor\r\ncommunities--as those of counties, cities, and towns--are merely\r\nfractional subdivisions of the State; and these do not affect the\r\nevidence that there was not such a political community as the \"people of\r\nthe United States in the aggregate.\"\r\n\r\nThat the States were severally sovereign and independent when they were\r\nunited under the Articles of Confederation, is distinctly asserted in\r\nthose articles, and is admitted even by the extreme partisans of\r\nconsolidation. Of right, they are still sovereign, unless they have\r\nsurrendered or been divested of their sovereignty; and those who deny\r\nthe proposition have been vainly called upon to point out the process by\r\nwhich they have divested themselves, or have been divested of it,\r\notherwise than by usurpation.\r\n\r\nSince Webster spoke and Story wrote upon the subject, however, the\r\nsovereignty of the States has been vehemently denied, or explained away\r\nas only a partial, imperfect, mutilated sovereignty. Paradoxical\r\ntheories of \"divided sovereignty\" and \"delegated sovereignty\" have\r\narisen, to create that \"confusion of ideas\" and engender those\r\n\"mischievous and unfounded conclusions,\" of which Judge Story speaks.\r\nConfounding the sovereign authority of the _people_ with the delegated\r\npowers conferred by them upon their _governments_, we hear of a\r\nGovernment of the United States \"sovereign within its sphere,\" and of\r\nState governments \"sovereign in _their_ sphere\"; of the surrender by the\r\nStates of _part_ of their sovereignty to the United States, and the\r\nlike. Now, if there be any one great principle pervading the Federal\r\nConstitution, the State Constitutions, the writings of the fathers, the\r\nwhole American system, as clearly as the sunlight pervades the solar\r\nsystem, it is that _no_ government is sovereign--that all governments\r\nderive their powers from the people, and exercise them in subjection to\r\nthe will of the people--not a will expressed in any irregular, lawless,\r\ntumultuary manner, but the will of the organized political community,\r\nexpressed through authorized and legitimate channels. The founders of\r\nthe American republics never conferred, nor intended to confer,\r\nsovereignty upon either their State or Federal Governments.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the people of the States, in forming a Federal Union,\r\nsurrendered--or, to use Burlamaqui's term, transferred--or if they meant\r\nto surrender or transfer--_part_ of their sovereignty, to whom was the\r\ntransfer made? Not to \"the people of the United States in the\r\naggregate\"; for there was no such people in existence, and they did not\r\ncreate or constitute such a people by merger of themselves. Not to the\r\nFederal Government; for they disclaimed, as a fundamental principle, the\r\nsovereignty of any government. There was no such surrender, no such\r\ntransfer, in whole or in part, expressed or implied. They retained, and\r\nintended to retain, their sovereignty in its integrity--undivided and\r\nindivisible.\r\n\r\n\"But, indeed,\" says Mr. Motley, \"the words 'sovereign' and 'sovereignty'\r\nare purely inapplicable to the American system. In the Declaration of\r\nIndependence the provinces declare themselves 'free and independent\r\nStates,' but the men of those days knew that the word 'sovereign' was a\r\nterm of feudal origin. When their connection with a time-honored feudal\r\nmonarchy was abruptly severed, the word 'sovereign' had no meaning for\r\nus.\"[62]\r\n\r\nIf this be true, \"the men of those days\" had a very extraordinary way of\r\nexpressing their conviction that the word \"had no meaning for us.\" We\r\nhave seen that, in the very front of their Articles of Confederation,\r\nthey set forth the conspicuous declaration that each State retained \"its\r\n_sovereignty_, freedom, and independence.\"\r\n\r\nMassachusetts--the State, I believe, of Mr. Motley's nativity and\r\ncitizenship--in her original Constitution, drawn up by \"men of those\r\ndays,\" made this declaration:\r\n\r\n    \"The people inhabiting the territory formerly called the\r\n    Province of Massachusetts Bay do hereby solemnly and mutually\r\n    agree with each other to form themselves into a free,\r\n    _sovereign_, and independent body politic, or State, by the name\r\n    of _The Commonwealth of Massachusetts_.\"\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire, in her Constitution, as revised in 1792, had identically\r\nthe same declaration, except as regards the name of the State and the\r\nword \"State\" instead of \"Commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Madison, one of the most distinguished of the men of that day and of\r\nthe advocates of the Constitution, in a speech already once referred to,\r\nin the Virginia Convention of 1788, explained that \"We, the people,\" who\r\nwere to establish the Constitution, were the people of \"thirteen\r\nSOVEREIGNTIES.\"[63]\r\n\r\nIn the \"Federalist,\" he repeatedly employs the term--as, for example,\r\nwhen he says: \"Do they [the fundamental principles of the Confederation]\r\nrequire that, in the establishment of the Constitution, the States\r\nshould be regarded as distinct and independent SOVEREIGNS? They _are_ so\r\nregarded by the Constitution proposed.\"[64]\r\n\r\nAlexander Hamilton--another contemporary authority, no less\r\nillustrious--says, in the \"Federalist\":\r\n\r\n    \"It is inherent in the nature of _sovereignty_, not to be\r\n    amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent. This\r\n    is the general sense and the general practice of mankind; and\r\n    the exemption, as one of the attributes of _sovereignty_, is now\r\n    enjoyed by the government of _every State_ in the Union.\"[65]\r\n\r\nIn the same paragraph he uses these terms, \"sovereign\" and\r\n\"sovereignty,\" repeatedly--always with reference to the States,\r\nrespectively and severally.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin advocated equality of suffrage in the Senate as a\r\nmeans of securing \"the _sovereignties_ of the individual States.\"[66]\r\nJames Wilson, of Pennsylvania, said sovereignty \"is in the people before\r\nthey make a Constitution, and remains in them,\" and described the people\r\nas being \"thirteen independent sovereignties.\"[67] Gouverneur Morris,\r\nwho was, as well as Wilson, one of the warmest advocates in the\r\nConvention of a strong central government, spoke of the Constitution as\r\n\"a _compact_,\" and of the parties to it as \"each enjoying _sovereign_\r\npower.\"[68] Roger Sherman, of Connecticut, declared that the Government\r\n\"was instituted by a number of _sovereign States_.\"[69] Oliver\r\nEllsworth, of the same State, spoke of the States as \"sovereign\r\nbodies.\"[70] These were all eminent members of the Convention which\r\nformed the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThere was scarcely a statesman of that period who did not leave on\r\nrecord expressions of the same sort. But why multiply citations? It is\r\nvery evident that the \"men of those days\" entertained very different\r\nviews of sovereignty from those set forth by the \"new lights\" of our\r\nday. Far from considering it a term of feudal origin, \"purely\r\ninapplicable to the American system,\" they seem to have regarded it as a\r\nvery vital principle in that system, and of necessity belonging to the\r\nseveral States--and I do not find a single instance in which they\r\napplied it to any political organization, except the States.\r\n\r\nTheir ideas were in entire accord with those of Vattel, who, in his\r\nchapter \"Of Nations or Sovereign States,\" writes, \"Every _nation_ that\r\ngoverns itself, under what form soever, without any dependence on\r\nforeign power, is a _sovereign state_.\"[71]\r\n\r\nIn another part of the same chapter he gives a lucid statement of the\r\nnature of a confederate republic, such as ours was designed to be. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    \"Several sovereign and independent states may unite themselves\r\n    together by a perpetual confederacy, without each in particular\r\n    ceasing to be _a perfect state_. They will form together a\r\n    federal republic: the deliberations in common will offer no\r\n    violence to _the sovereignty of each member_, though they may,\r\n    in certain respects, put some restraint on the exercise of it,\r\n    in virtue of voluntary engagements. A person does not cease to\r\n    be free and independent, when he is obliged to fulfill the\r\n    engagements into which he has very willingly entered.\"[72]\r\n\r\nWhat this celebrated author means here by a person, is explained by a\r\nsubsequent passage: \"The law of nations is the law of sovereigns; states\r\nfree and independent are moral persons.\"[73]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: \"Principes du Droit Politique,\" chap. v, section I; also,\r\nchap. vii, section 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Ibid., chap. vii, section 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: \"Rebellion Record,\" vol. i, Documents, p. 211.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Elliott's \"Debates,\" vol. iii, p. 114, edition of 1836.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: \"Federalist,\" No. xl.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Ibid, No. lxxxi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: See Elliott's \"Debates,\" vol. v, p. 266.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: Ibid., vol. ii, p. 443.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: See \"Life of Gouverneur Morris,\" vol. iii, p. 193.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: See \"Writings of John Adams,\" vol. vii, letter of Roger\r\nSherman.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: See Eliott's \"Debates,\" vol. ii, p. 197.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: \"Law of Nations,\" Book I, chap. i, section 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: Ibid., section 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Ibid., section 12.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n    The same Subject continued.--The Tenth Amendment.--Fallacies\r\n    exposed.--\"Constitution,\" \"Government,\" and \"People\"\r\n    distinguished from each other.--Theories refuted by\r\n    Facts.--Characteristics of Sovereignty.--Sovereignty\r\n    identified.--Never thrown away.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any lingering doubt could have existed as to the reservation of their\r\nentire sovereignty by the people of the respective States, when they\r\norganized the Federal Union, it would have been removed by the adoption\r\nof the tenth amendment to the Constitution, which was not only one of\r\nthe amendments proposed by various States when ratifying that\r\ninstrument, but the particular one in which they substantially agreed,\r\nand upon which they most urgently insisted. Indeed, it is quite certain\r\nthat the Constitution would never have received the assent and\r\nratification of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina,\r\nand perhaps other States, but for a well-grounded assurance that the\r\nsubstance of this amendment would be adopted as soon as the requisite\r\nformalities could be complied with. That amendment is in these words:\r\n\r\n    \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the\r\n    Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to\r\n    the States respectively, or to the people.\"\r\n\r\nThe full meaning of this article may not be as clear to us as it was to\r\nthe men of that period, on account of the confusion of ideas by which\r\nthe term \"people\"--plain enough to them--has since been obscured, and\r\nalso the ambiguity attendant upon the use of the little conjunction\r\n_or_, which has been said to be the most equivocal word in our language,\r\nand for that reason has been excluded from indictments in the English\r\ncourts. The true intent and meaning of the provision, however, may be\r\nascertained from an examination and comparison of the terms in which it\r\nwas expressed by the various States which proposed it, and whose ideas\r\nit was intended to embody.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts and New Hampshire, in their ordinances of ratification,\r\nexpressing the opinion \"that certain amendments and alterations in the\r\nsaid Constitution would remove the fears and quiet the apprehensions of\r\nmany of the good people of this Commonwealth [State (New Hampshire)],\r\nand more effectually guard against an undue administration of the\r\nFederal Government,\" each recommended several such amendments, putting\r\nthis at the head in the following form:\r\n\r\n    \"That it be explicitly declared that all powers not expressly\r\n    delegated by the aforesaid Constitution are _reserved to the\r\n    several States_, to be by them exercised.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, those stanch republican communities meant _the people of the\r\nStates_--not their _governments_, as something distinct from their\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nNew York expressed herself as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"That the powers of government may be reassumed by the people\r\n    whenever it shall become necessary to their happiness; that\r\n    every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by the said\r\n    Constitution clearly delegated to the Congress of the United\r\n    States, or the departments of the Government thereof, remains to\r\n    _the people of the several States, or to their respective State\r\n    governments, to whom they may have granted the same_; and that\r\n    those clauses in the said Constitution, which declare that\r\n    Congress shall not have or exercise certain powers, do not imply\r\n    that Congress is entitled to any powers not given by the said\r\n    Constitution; but such clauses are to be construed either as\r\n    exceptions to certain specified powers or as inserted merely for\r\n    greater caution.\"\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina expressed the idea thus:\r\n\r\n    \"This Convention doth also declare that no section or paragraph\r\n    of the said Constitution warrants a construction that _the\r\n    States do not retain_ every power not expressly relinquished by\r\n    them and vested in the General Government of the Union.\"\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina proposed it in these terms:\r\n\r\n    \"Each State in the Union shall respectively retain every power,\r\n    jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Constitution\r\n    delegated to the Congress of the United States or to the\r\n    departments of the General Government.\"\r\n\r\nRhode Island gave in her long-withheld assent to the Constitution, \"in\r\nfull confidence\" that certain proposed amendments would be adopted, the\r\nfirst of which was expressed in these words:\r\n\r\n    \"That Congress shall guarantee _to each State_ its SOVEREIGNTY,\r\n    _freedom, and independence_, and every power, jurisdiction, and\r\n    right, which is not by this Constitution expressly delegated to\r\n    the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThis was in May, 1790, when nearly three years had been given to\r\ndiscussion and explanation of the new Government by its founders and\r\nothers, when it had been in actual operation for more than a year, and\r\nwhen there was every advantage for a clear understanding of its nature\r\nand principles. Under such circumstances, and in the \"full confidence\"\r\nthat this language expressed its meaning and intent, the people of Rhode\r\nIsland signified their \"accession\" to the \"Confederate Republic\" of the\r\nStates already united.\r\n\r\nNo objection was made from any quarter to the principle asserted in\r\nthese various forms; or to the amendment in which it was finally\r\nexpressed, although many thought it unnecessary, as being merely\r\ndeclaratory of what would have been sufficiently obvious without\r\nit--that the functions of the Government of the United States were\r\nstrictly limited to the exercise of such powers as were expressly\r\ndelegated, and that the people of the several States retained all\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIs it compatible with reason to suppose that people so chary of the\r\ndelegation of specific powers or functions could have meant to surrender\r\nor transfer the very basis and origin of all power--their inherent\r\nsovereignty--and this, not by express grant, but by implication?\r\n\r\nMr. Everett, following, whether consciously or not, in the line of Mr.\r\nWebster's ill-considered objection to the term \"compact,\" takes\r\nexception to the sovereignty of the States on the ground that \"the\r\n_word_ 'sovereignty' does not occur\" in the Constitution. He admits that\r\nthe States were sovereign under the Articles of Confederation. How could\r\nthey relinquish or be deprived of their sovereignty without even a\r\nmention of it--when the tenth amendment confronts us with the\r\ndeclaration that _nothing_ was surrendered by implication--that\r\neverything was reserved unless expressly delegated to the United States\r\nor prohibited to the States? Here is an attribute which they certainly\r\npossessed--which nobody denies, or can deny, that they _did_\r\npossess--and of which Mr. Everett says no mention is made in the\r\nConstitution. In what conceivable way, then, was it lost or alienated?\r\n\r\nMuch has been said of the \"prohibition\" of the exercise by the States of\r\ncertain functions of sovereignty; such as, making treaties, declaring\r\nwar, coining money, etc. This is only a part of the general compact, by\r\nwhich the contracting parties covenant, one with another, to abstain\r\nfrom the separate exercise of certain powers, which they agree to\r\nintrust to the management and control of the union or general agency of\r\nthe parties associated. It is not a prohibition imposed upon them from\r\nwithout, or from above, by any external or superior power, but is\r\nself-imposed by their free consent. The case is strictly analogous to\r\nthat of individuals forming a mercantile or manufacturing copartnership,\r\nwho voluntarily agree to refrain, as individuals, from engaging in other\r\npursuits or speculations, from lending their individual credit, or from\r\nthe exercise of any other right of a citizen, which they may think\r\nproper to subject to the consent, or intrust to the management of the\r\nfirm.\r\n\r\nThe prohibitory clauses of the Constitution referred to are not at all a\r\ndenial of the full sovereignty of the States, but are merely an\r\nagreement among them to exercise certain powers of sovereignty in\r\nconcert, and not separately and apart.\r\n\r\nThere is one other provision of the Constitution, which is generally\r\nadduced by the friends of centralism as antagonistic to State\r\nsovereignty. This is found in the second clause of the sixth article, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    \"This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which\r\n    shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or\r\n    which shall be made, under the authority of the United States,\r\n    shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every\r\n    State shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or\r\n    laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\nThis enunciation of a principle, which, even if it had not been\r\nexpressly declared, would have been a necessary deduction from the\r\nacceptance of the Constitution itself, has been magnified and perverted\r\ninto a meaning and purpose entirely foreign to that which plain\r\ninterpretation is sufficient to discern. Mr. Motley thus dilates on the\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n    \"Could language be more imperial? Could the claim to State\r\n    'sovereignty' be more completely disposed of at a word? How can\r\n    that be sovereign, acknowledging no superior, supreme, which has\r\n    voluntarily accepted a supreme law from something which it\r\n    acknowledges as superior?\"[74]\r\n\r\nThe mistake which Mr. Motley--like other writers of the same\r\nschool--makes is one which is disposed of by a very simple correction.\r\nThe States, which ordained and established the Constitution, _accepted_\r\nnothing besides what they themselves _prescribed_. They acknowledged no\r\nsuperior. The supremacy was both in degree and extent only that which\r\nwas delegated by the States to their common agent.\r\n\r\nThere are some other considerations which may conduce to a clearer\r\nunderstanding of this supremacy of the Constitution and the laws made in\r\npursuance thereof:\r\n\r\n1. In the first place, it must be remembered that, when the Federal\r\nConstitution was formed, each then existing State already had its own\r\nConstitution and code of statute laws. It was, no doubt, primarily with\r\nreference to these that the provision was inserted, and not in the\r\nexpectation of future conflicts or discrepancies. It is in this light\r\nalone that Mr. Madison considers it in explaining and vindicating it in\r\nthe \"Federalist.\"[75]\r\n\r\n2. Again, it is to be observed that the supremacy accorded to the\r\ngeneral laws of the United States is expressly limited to those enacted\r\nin conformity with the Constitution, or, to use the exact language,\r\n\"made in pursuance thereof.\" Mr. Hamilton, in another chapter of the\r\n\"Federalist,\" calls particular attention to this, saying (and the\r\nitalics are all his own) \"that the laws of the Confederacy, as to the\r\n_enumerated_ and _legitimate_ objects of its jurisdiction, will become\r\nthe supreme law of the land,\" and that the State functionaries will\r\ncoöperate in their observance and enforcement with the General\r\nGovernment, \"_as far as its just and constitutional authority\r\nextends_.\"[76]\r\n\r\n3. In the third place, it is not the _Government_ of the United States\r\nthat is declared to be supreme, but the _Constitution_ and the laws and\r\ntreaties made in accordance with it. The proposition was made in the\r\nConvention to organize a government consisting of \"supreme legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judicial powers,\" but it was not adopted. Its deliberate\r\nrejection is much more significant and conclusive than if it had never\r\nbeen proposed. Correction of so gross an error as that of confounding\r\nthe Government with the Constitution ought to be superfluous, but so\r\ncrude and confused are the ideas which have been propagated on the\r\nsubject, that no misconception seems to be too absurd to be possible.\r\nThus, it has not been uncommon, of late years, to hear, even in the\r\nhighest places, the oath to support the Constitution, which is taken by\r\nboth State and Federal officers, spoken of as an oath \"to support _the\r\nGovernment_\"--an obligation never imposed upon any one in this country,\r\nand which the men who made the Constitution, with their recent\r\nreminiscences of the Revolution, the battles of which they had fought\r\nwith halters around their necks, would have been the last to prescribe.\r\nCould any assertion be less credible than that they proceeded to\r\ninstitute another supreme government which it would be treason to\r\nresist?\r\n\r\nThis confusion of ideas pervades the treatment of the whole subject of\r\nsovereignty. Mr. Webster has said, and very justly so far as these\r\nUnited States are concerned: \"The sovereignty of government is an idea\r\nbelonging to the other side of the Atlantic. No such thing is known in\r\nNorth America. Our governments are all limited. In Europe sovereignty is\r\nof feudal origin, and imports no more than the state of the sovereign.\r\nIt comprises his rights, duties, exemptions, prerogatives, and powers.\r\nBut with us all power is with the people. They alone are sovereign, and\r\nthey erect what governments they please, and confer on them such powers\r\nas they please. None of these governments are sovereign, in the European\r\nsense of the word, all being restrained by written constitutions.\"[77]\r\n\r\nBut the same intellect, which can so clearly discern and so lucidly\r\ndefine the general proposition, seems to be covered by a cloud of thick\r\ndarkness when it comes to apply it to the particular case in issue.\r\nThus, a little afterward, we have the following:\r\n\r\n    \"There is no language in the whole Constitution applicable to a\r\n    confederation of States. If the States be parties, as States,\r\n    what are their rights, and what their respective covenants and\r\n    stipulations? and where are their rights, covenants, and\r\n    stipulations expressed? In the Articles of Confederation they\r\n    did make promises, and did enter into engagements, and did\r\n    plight the faith of each State for their fulfillment; but in the\r\n    Constitution there is nothing of that kind. The reason is that,\r\n    in the Constitution, it is the people who speak and not the\r\n    States. The people ordain the Constitution, and therein address\r\n    themselves to the States and to the Legislatures of the States\r\n    in the language of injunction and prohibition.\"[78]\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that such inconsistent ideas should proceed from a\r\nsource so eminent. Its author falls into the very error which he had\r\njust before so distinctly pointed out, in confounding the people of the\r\nStates with their governments. In the vehemence of his hostility to\r\nState sovereignty, he seems--as all of his disciples seem--unable even\r\nto comprehend that it means the sovereignty, not of State governments,\r\nbut of people who make them. With minds preoccupied by the unreal idea\r\nof one great people of a consolidated nation, these gentlemen are\r\nblinded to the plain and primary truth that the only way in which the\r\npeople ordained the Constitution was as the people of States. When Mr.\r\nWebster says that \"in the Constitution it is the people who speak, and\r\nnot the States,\" he says what is untenable. The States _are_ the people.\r\nThe people do not speak, never have spoken, and never can speak, in\r\ntheir sovereign capacity (without a subversion of our whole system),\r\notherwise than as the people of States.\r\n\r\nThere are but two modes of expressing their sovereign will known to the\r\npeople of this country. One is by direct vote--the mode adopted by Rhode\r\nIsland in 1788, when she rejected the Constitution. The other is the\r\nmethod, more generally pursued, of acting by means of conventions of\r\ndelegates elected expressly as representatives of the sovereignty of the\r\npeople. Now, it is not a matter of opinion or theory or speculation, but\r\na plain, undeniable, historical _fact_, that there never has been any\r\nact or expression of sovereignty in either of these modes by that\r\nimaginary community, \"the people of the United States in the aggregate.\"\r\n_Usurpations of power_ by the _Government_ of the United States, there\r\nmay have been, and may be again, but there has never been either a\r\nsovereign convention or a direct vote of the \"whole people\" of the\r\nUnited States to demonstrate its existence as a corporate unit. Every\r\nexercise of sovereignty by any of the people of this country that has\r\nactually taken place has been by the people of States _as_ States. In\r\nthe face of this fact, is it not the merest self-stultification to admit\r\nthe sovereignty of the people and deny it to the States, in which alone\r\nthey have community existence?\r\n\r\nThis subject is one of such vital importance to a right understanding of\r\nthe events which this work is designed to record and explain, that it\r\ncan not be dismissed without an effort in the way of recapitulation and\r\nconclusion, to make it clear beyond the possibility of misconception.\r\n\r\nAccording to the American theory, every individual is endowed with\r\ncertain unalienable rights, among which are \"life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness.\" He is entitled to all the freedom, in these and\r\nin other respects, that is consistent with the safety and the rights of\r\nothers and the weal of the community, but political sovereignty, which\r\nis the source and origin of all the powers of _government_--legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judicial--belongs to, and inheres in, the people of an\r\norganized political community. It is an attribute of the _whole people_\r\nof such a community. It includes the power and necessarily the duty of\r\nprotecting the rights and redressing the wrongs of individuals, of\r\npunishing crimes, enforcing contracts, prescribing rules for the\r\ntransfer of property and the succession of estates, making treaties with\r\nforeign powers, levying taxes, etc. The enumeration of particulars might\r\nbe extended, but these will suffice as illustrations.\r\n\r\nThese powers are of course exercised through the agency of governments,\r\nbut the governments are _only_ agents of the sovereign--responsible to\r\nit, and subject to its control. This sovereign--the people, in the\r\naggregate, of each political community--delegates to the government the\r\nexercise of such powers, or functions, as it thinks proper, but in an\r\nAmerican republic never transfers or surrenders sovereignty. _That_\r\nremains, unalienated and unimpaired. It is by virtue of this sovereignty\r\nalone that the Government, its authorized agent, commands the obedience\r\nof the individual citizen, to the extent of its derivative, dependent,\r\nand delegated authority. The ALLEGIANCE of the citizen is due to the\r\nsovereign alone.\r\n\r\nThus far, I think, all will agree. No American statesman or publicist\r\nwould venture to dispute it. Notwithstanding the inconsiderate or\r\nill-considered expressions thrown out by some persons about the unity of\r\nthe American people from the beginning, no respectable authority has\r\never had the hardihood to deny that, before the adoption of the Federal\r\nConstitution, the only sovereign political community was the people of\r\nthe State--the people of _each State_. The ordinary exercise of what are\r\ngenerally termed the powers of sovereignty was by and through their\r\nrespective governments; and, when they formed a confederation, a portion\r\nof those powers was intrusted to the General Government, or agency.\r\nUnder the Confederation, the Congress of the United States represented\r\nthe collective power of the States; but the people of each State alone\r\npossessed sovereignty, and consequently were entitled to the allegiance\r\nof the citizen.\r\n\r\nWhen the Articles of Confederation were amended, when the new\r\nConstitution was substituted in their place and the General Government\r\nreorganized, its structure was changed, additional powers were conferred\r\nupon it, and thereby subtracted from the powers theretofore exercised by\r\nthe State governments; but the seat of sovereignty--the source of all\r\nthose delegated and dependent powers--was not disturbed. There was a new\r\nGovernment or an amended Government--it is entirely immaterial in which\r\nof these lights we consider it--but no new PEOPLE was created or\r\nconstituted. The people, in whom alone sovereignty inheres, remained\r\njust as they had been before. The only change was in the form,\r\nstructure, and relations of their governmental agencies.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, the States--the people of the States--if they had been so\r\ndisposed, might have merged themselves into one great consolidated\r\nState, retaining their geographical boundaries merely as matters of\r\nconvenience. But such a merger must have been distinctly and formally\r\nstated, not left to deduction or implication.\r\n\r\nMen do not alienate even an estate, without positive and express terms\r\nand stipulations. But in this case not only was there no express\r\ntransfer--no formal surrender--of the preëxisting sovereignty, but it\r\nwas expressly provided that nothing should be _understood_ as even\r\n_delegated_--that everything was reserved, unless granted in express\r\nterms. The monstrous conception of the creation of a new people,\r\ninvested with the whole or a great part of the sovereignty which had\r\npreviously belonged to the people of each State, has not a syllable to\r\nsustain it in the Constitution, but is built up entirely upon the\r\npalpable misconstruction of a single expression in the preamble.\r\n\r\nIn denying that there is any such collective unit as the people of the\r\nUnited States in the aggregate, of course I am not to be understood as\r\ndenying that there is such a political organization as the United\r\nStates, or that there exists, with large and distinct powers, a\r\n_Government_ of the United States; but it is claimed that the Union, as\r\nits name implies, is constituted of States. As a British author,[79]\r\nreferring to the old Teutonic system, has expressed the same idea, the\r\nStates are the integers, the United States the multiple which results\r\nfrom them. The Government of the United States derives its existence\r\nfrom the same source, and exercises its functions by the will of the\r\nsame sovereignty that creates and confers authority upon the State\r\ngovernments. The people of each State are, in either case, the source.\r\nThe only difference is that, in the creation of the State governments,\r\neach sovereign acted alone; in that of the Federal Government, they\r\nacted in coöperation with the others. Neither the whole nor any part of\r\ntheir sovereignty has been surrendered to either Government.\r\n\r\nTo whom, in fine, _could_ the States have surrendered their sovereignty?\r\nNot to the mass of the people inhabiting the territory possessed by all\r\nthe States, for there was no such community in existence, and they took\r\nno measures for the organization of such a community. If they had\r\nintended to do so, the very style, \"United States,\" would have been a\r\npalpable misnomer, nor would treason have been defined as levying war\r\nagainst _them_. Could it have been transferred to the Government of the\r\nUnion? Clearly not, in accordance with the ideas and principles of those\r\nwho made the Declaration of Independence, adopted the Articles of\r\nConfederation, and established the Constitution of the United States;\r\nfor in each and all of these the corner-stone is the inherent and\r\ninalienable sovereignty of the people. To have transferred sovereignty\r\nfrom the people to a Government would have been to have fought the\r\nbattles of the Revolution in vain--not for the freedom and independence\r\nof the States, but for a mere change of masters. Such a thought or\r\npurpose could not have been in the heads or hearts of those who molded\r\nthe Union, and could have found lodgment only when the ebbing tide of\r\npatriotism and fraternity had swept away the landmarks which they\r\nerected who sought by the compact of union to secure and perpetuate the\r\nliberties then possessed. The men who had won at great cost the\r\nindependence of their respective States were deeply impressed with the\r\nvalue of union, but they could never have consented, like \"the base\r\nJudean,\" to fling away the priceless pearl of State sovereignty for any\r\npossible alliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: \"Rebellion Record,\" vol. i, Documents, p. 213.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: \"Federalist,\" No. xliv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: \"Federalist,\" No. xxvii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: \"Congressional Debates,\" vol. ix, Part I, p. 565.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Ibid., p. 566.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Sir Francis Palgrave, quoted by Mr. Calhoun,\r\n\"Congressional Debates,\" vol. ix, Part I, p. 541.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n    A Recapitulation.--Remarkable Propositions of Mr. Gouverneur\r\n    Morris in the Convention of 1787, and their Fate.--Further\r\n    Testimony.--Hamilton, Madison, Washington, Marshall, etc.--Later\r\n    Theories.--Mr. Webster: his Views at Various Periods.--Speech at\r\n    Capon Springs.--State Rights not a Sectional Theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking back for a moment at the ground over which we have gone, I think\r\nit may be fairly asserted that the following propositions have been\r\nclearly and fully established:\r\n\r\n1. That the States of which the American Union was formed, from the\r\nmoment when they emerged from their colonial or provincial condition,\r\nbecame severally sovereign, free, and independent States--not one State,\r\nor nation.\r\n\r\n2. That the union formed under the Articles of Confederation was a\r\ncompact between the States, in which these attributes of \"sovereignty,\r\nfreedom, and independence,\" were expressly asserted and guaranteed.\r\n\r\n3. That, in forming the \"more perfect union\" of the Constitution,\r\nafterward adopted, the same contracting powers formed an _amended\r\ncompact_, without any surrender of these attributes of sovereignty,\r\nfreedom, and independence, either expressed or implied: on the contrary,\r\nthat, by the tenth amendment to the Constitution, limiting the power of\r\nthe Government to its express grants, they distinctly guarded against\r\nthe presumption of a surrender of anything by implication.\r\n\r\n4. That political sovereignty resides, neither in individual citizens,\r\nnor in unorganized masses, nor in fractional subdivisions of a\r\ncommunity, but in the people of an organized political body.\r\n\r\n5. That no \"republican form of government,\" in the sense in which that\r\nexpression is used in the Constitution, and was generally understood by\r\nthe founders of the Union--whether it be the government of a State or of\r\na confederation of States--is possessed of any sovereignty whatever, but\r\nmerely exercises certain powers delegated by the sovereign authority of\r\nthe people, and subject to recall and reassumption by the same authority\r\nthat conferred them.\r\n\r\n6. That the \"people\" who organized the first confederation, the people\r\nwho dissolved it, the people who ordained and established the\r\nConstitution which succeeded it, the only people, in fine, known or\r\nreferred to in the phraseology of that period--whether the term was used\r\ncollectively or distributively--were the people of the respective\r\nStates, each acting separately and with absolute independence of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n7. That, in forming and adopting the Constitution, the States, or the\r\npeople of the States--terms which, when used with reference to acts\r\nperformed in a sovereign capacity, are precisely equivalent to each\r\nother--formed a new _Government_, but no new _people_; and that,\r\nconsequently, no new sovereignty was created--for sovereignty in an\r\nAmerican republic can belong only to a people, never to a\r\ngovernment--and that the Federal Government is entitled to exercise only\r\nthe powers delegated to it by the people of the respective States.\r\n\r\n8. That the term \"people,\" in the preamble to the Constitution and in\r\nthe tenth amendment, is used distributively; that the only \"people of\r\nthe United States\" known to the Constitution are the people of each\r\nState in the Union; that no such political community or corporate unit\r\nas one people of the United States then existed, has ever been\r\norganized, or yet exists; and that no political action by the people of\r\nthe United States in the aggregate has ever taken place, or ever can\r\ntake place, under the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe fictitious idea of _one_ people of the United States, contradicted\r\nin the last paragraph, has been so impressed upon the popular mind by\r\nfalse teaching, by careless and vicious phraseology, and by the\r\never-present spectacle of a great Government, with its army and navy,\r\nits custom-houses and post-offices, its multitude of office-holders, and\r\nthe splendid prizes which it offers to political ambition, that the\r\ntearing away of these illusions and presentation of the original fabric,\r\nwhich they have overgrown and hidden from view, have no doubt been\r\nunwelcome, distasteful, and even repellent to some of my readers. The\r\nartificial splendor which makes the deception attractive is even\r\nemployed as an argument to prove its reality.\r\n\r\nThe glitter of the powers delegated to the agent serves to obscure the\r\nperception of the sovereign power of the principal by whom they are\r\nconferred, as, by the unpracticed eye, the showy costume and conspicuous\r\nfunctions of the drum-major are mistaken for emblems of\r\nchieftaincy--while the misuse or ambiguous use of the term \"Union\" and\r\nits congeners contributes to increase the confusion.\r\n\r\nSo much the more need for insisting upon the elementary truths which\r\nhave been obscured by these specious sophistries. The reader really\r\ndesirous of ascertaining truth is, therefore, again cautioned against\r\nconfounding two ideas so essentially distinct as that of _government_,\r\nwhich is derivative, dependent, and subordinate, with that of the\r\n_people_, as an organized political community, which is sovereign,\r\nwithout any other than self-imposed limitations, and such as proceed\r\nfrom the general principles of the personal rights of man.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, in a foregoing chapter, that the authors of the\r\nConstitution could scarcely have anticipated the idea of such a\r\ncommunity as the people of the United States in one mass. Perhaps this\r\nexpression needs some little qualification, for there is rarely a\r\nfallacy, however stupendous, that is wholly original. A careful\r\nexamination of the records of the Convention of 1787 exhibits one or\r\nperhaps two instances of such a suggestion--both by the same person--and\r\nthe result in each case is strikingly significant.\r\n\r\nThe original proposition made concerning the office of President of the\r\nUnited States contemplated his election by the Congress, or, as it was\r\ntermed by the proposer, \"the national Legislature.\" On the 17th of July,\r\nthis proposition being under consideration, Mr. Gouverneur Morris moved\r\nthat the words \"national Legislature\" be stricken out, and \"citizens of\r\nthe United States\" inserted. The proposition was supported by Mr. James\r\nWilson--both of these gentlemen being delegates from Pennsylvania, and\r\nboth among the most earnest advocates of centralism in the Convention.\r\n\r\nNow, it is not at all certain that Mr. Morris had in view an election by\r\nthe citizens of the United States \"in the aggregate,\" voting as _one\r\npeople_. The language of his proposition is entirely consistent with the\r\nidea of as election by the citizens of each State, voting separately and\r\nindependently, though it is ambiguous, and may admit of the other\r\nconstruction. But this is immaterial. The proposition was submitted to a\r\nvote, and received the approval of only _one State_--Pennsylvania, of\r\nwhich Mr. Morris and Mr. Wilson were both representatives. _Nine_ States\r\nvoted against it.[80]\r\n\r\nSix days afterward (July 23d), in a discussion of the proposed\r\nratification of the Constitution by Conventions of the people of each\r\nState, Mr. Gouverneur Morris--as we learn from Mr. Madison--\"moved that\r\nthe reference of the plan [i.e., of the proposed Constitution] be made\r\nto one General Convention, chosen and authorized by the people, to\r\nconsider, amend, and establish the same.\"[81]\r\n\r\nHere the issue seems to have been more distinctly made between the two\r\nideas of people of the States and one people in the aggregate. The fate\r\nof the latter is briefly recorded in the two words, \"not seconded.\" Mr.\r\nMorris was a man of distinguished ability, great personal influence, and\r\nundoubted patriotism, but, out of all that assemblage--comprising, as it\r\ndid, such admitted friends of centralism as Hamilton, King, Wilson,\r\nRandolph, Pinckney, and others--there was not one to sustain him in the\r\nproposition to incorporate into the Constitution that theory which now\r\npredominates, the theory on which was waged the late bloody war, which\r\nwas called a \"war for the Union.\" It failed for want of a second, and\r\ndoes not even appear in the official journal of the Convention. The very\r\nfact that such a suggestion was made would be unknown to us but for the\r\nrecord kept by Mr. Madison.\r\n\r\nThe extracts which have been given, in treating of special branches of\r\nthe subject, from the writings and speeches of the framers of the\r\nConstitution and other statesmen of that period, afford ample proof of\r\ntheir entire and almost unanimous accord with the principles which have\r\nbeen established on the authority of the Constitution itself, the acts\r\nof ratification by the several States, and other attestations of the\r\nhighest authority and validity. I am well aware that isolated\r\nexpressions may be found in the reports of debates on the General and\r\nState Conventions and other public bodies, indicating the existence of\r\nindividual opinions seemingly inconsistent with these principles; that\r\nloose and confused ideas were sometimes expressed with regard to\r\nsovereignty, the relations between governments and people, and kindred\r\nsubjects; and that, while the plan of the Constitution was under\r\ndiscussion, and before it was definitely reduced to its present shape,\r\nthere were earnest advocates in the Convention of a more consolidated\r\nsystem, with a stronger central government. But these expressions of\r\nindividual opinion only prove the existence of a small minority of\r\ndissentients from the principles generally entertained, and which\r\nfinally prevailed in the formation of the Constitution. None of these\r\never avowed such extravagances of doctrine as are promulgated in this\r\ngeneration. No statesman of that day would have ventured to risk his\r\nreputation by construing an obligation to support the Constitution as an\r\nobligation to adhere to the Federal Government--a construction which\r\nwould have insured the sweeping away of any plan of union embodying it,\r\nby a tempest of popular indignation from every quarter of the country.\r\nNone of them suggested such an idea as that of the amalgamation of the\r\npeople of the States into one consolidated mass--unless it was suggested\r\nby Mr. Gouverneur Morris in the proposition above referred to, in which\r\nhe stood alone among the delegates of twelve sovereign States assembled\r\nin convention.\r\n\r\nAs to the features of centralism, or nationalism, which they did\r\nadvocate, all the ability of this little minority of really gifted men\r\nfailed to secure the incorporation of any one of them into the\r\nConstitution, or to obtain their recognition by any of the ratifying\r\nStates. On the contrary, the very men who had been the leading advocates\r\nof such theories, on failing to secure their adoption, loyally accepted\r\nthe result, and became the ablest and most efficient supporters of the\r\nprinciples which had prevailed. Thus, Mr. Hamilton, who had favored the\r\nplan of a President and Senate, both elected to hold office for life (or\r\nduring good behavior), with a veto power in Congress on the action of\r\nthe State Legislatures, became, through the \"Federalist,\" in conjunction\r\nwith his associates, Mr. Madison and Mr. Jay, the most distinguished\r\nexpounder and advocate of the Constitution, as then proposed and\r\nafterward ratified, with all its Federal and State-rights features. In\r\nthe ninth number of that remarkable series of political essays, he\r\nquotes, adopts, and applies to the then proposed Constitution,\r\nMontesquieu's description of a \"CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC,\" a term which he\r\n(Hamilton) repeatedly employs.\r\n\r\nIn the eighty-first number of the same series, replying to apprehensions\r\nexpressed by some that a State might be brought before the Federal\r\ncourts to answer as defendant in suits instituted against her, he repels\r\nthe idea in these plain and conclusive terms. The italics are my own:\r\n\r\n    \"It is inherent in the nature of _sovereignty_ not to be\r\n    amenable to the suit of any individual without its consent. This\r\n    is the general sense and the general practice of mankind; and\r\n    the exemption, as one of the _attributes of sovereignty_, is now\r\n    enjoyed by the government of _every State in the Union_. Unless,\r\n    therefore, there is _a surrender of this immunity_ in the plan\r\n    of the Convention, _it will remain with the States_, and the\r\n    danger intimated must be merely ideal.... The contracts between\r\n    _a nation_ and individuals are only binding on the conscience of\r\n    _the sovereign_, and have no pretensions to a compulsive force.\r\n    They confer no right of action, independent of _the sovereign\r\n    will_. To what purpose would it be to authorize suits against\r\n    States for the debts they owe? How could recoveries be enforced?\r\n    It is evident that it could not be done without _waging war_\r\n    against the contracting State; and to ascribe to the Federal\r\n    courts, by mere implication, and in destruction of a preëxisting\r\n    right of the State governments, a power which would involve such\r\n    a consequence, would be altogether forced and unwarranted.\"[82]\r\n\r\nThis extract is very significant, clearly showing that Mr. Hamilton\r\nassumed as undisputed propositions, in the first place, that the State\r\nwas _the_ \"SOVEREIGN\"; secondly, that this sovereignty could not be\r\nalienated, unless by express surrender; thirdly, that no such surrender\r\nhad been made; and, fourthly, that the idea of applying coercion to a\r\nState, even to enforce the fulfillment of a duty, would be equivalent to\r\nwaging war against a State--it was \"altogether forced and\r\nunwarrantable.\"\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent number, Mr. Hamilton, replying to the objection that the\r\nConstitution contains no bill or declaration of rights, argues that it\r\nwas entirely unnecessary, because in reality the people--that is, of\r\ncourse, the people, respectively, of the several States, who were the\r\nonly people known to the Constitution or to the country--had surrendered\r\nnothing of their inherent sovereignty, but retained it unimpaired. He\r\nsays: \"Here, in strictness, the people _surrender nothing_; and, as they\r\n_retain everything_, they have no need of particular reservations.\" And\r\nagain: \"I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and\r\nto the extent they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the\r\nproposed Constitution, but would be absolutely dangerous. They would\r\ncontain various exceptions to _powers not granted_, and on this very\r\naccount would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were\r\ngranted. For why declare that things shall not be done, which there is\r\nno power to do?\"[83] Could language be more clear or more complete in\r\nvindication of the principles laid down in this work? Mr. Hamilton\r\ndeclares, in effect, that the grants to the Federal Government in the\r\nConstitution are not surrenders, but delegations of power by the people\r\nof the States; that sovereignty remains intact where it was before; and\r\nthat the delegations of power were strictly limited to those expressly\r\ngranted--in this, merely anticipating the tenth amendment, afterward\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the concluding article of the \"Federalist,\" he bears\r\nemphatic testimony to the same principles, in the remark that \"every\r\nConstitution for the United States must inevitably consist of a great\r\nvariety of particulars, in which _thirteen independent States_ are to be\r\naccommodated in their interests or opinions of interest.... Hence the\r\nnecessity of molding and arranging all the particulars, which are to\r\ncompose the whole, in such a manner as to satisfy _all the parties_ to\r\nthe compact.\"[84] There is no intimation here, or anywhere else, of the\r\nexistence of any such idea as that of the aggregated people of one great\r\nconsolidated state. It is an incidental enunciation of the same truth\r\nsoon afterward asserted by Madison in the Virginia Convention--that the\r\npeople who ordained and established the Constitution were \"not the\r\npeople as composing one great body, but the people as composing thirteen\r\nsovereignties\".\r\n\r\nMr. Madison, in the Philadelphia Convention, had at first held views of\r\nthe sort of government which it was desirable to organize, similar to\r\nthose of Mr. Hamilton, though more moderate in extent. He, too, however,\r\ncordially conformed to the modifications in them made by his colleagues,\r\nand was no less zealous and eminent in defending and expounding the\r\nConstitution as finally adopted. His interpretation of its fundamental\r\nprinciples is so fully shown in the extracts which have already been\r\ngiven from his contributions to the \"Federalist\" and speeches in the\r\nVirginia Convention, that it would be superfluous to make any additional\r\ncitation from them.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of Hamilton and Madison--two of the most eminent of the\r\nauthors of the Constitution, and the two preeminent contemporary\r\nexpounders of its meaning--is the most valuable that could be offered\r\nfor its interpretation. That of all the other statesmen of the period\r\nonly tends to confirm the same conclusions. The illustrious Washington,\r\nwho presided over the Philadelphia Convention, in his correspondence,\r\nrepeatedly refers to the proposed Union as a \"Confederacy\" of States, or\r\na \"confederated Government,\" and to the several States as \"acceding,\" or\r\nsignifying their \"accession,\" to it, in ratifying the Constitution. He\r\nrefers to the Constitution itself as \"a compact or treaty,\" and\r\nclassifies it among compacts or treaties between \"men, bodies of men, or\r\ncountries.\" Writing to Count Rochambeau, on January 8, 1788, he says\r\nthat the proposed Constitution \"is to be submitted to conventions chosen\r\nby _the people in the several States_, and by them approved or\r\nrejected\"--showing what _he_ understood by \"the people of the United\r\nStates,\" who were to ordain and establish it. These same people--that\r\nis, \"the people of the several States\"--he says, in a letter to\r\nLafayette, April 28, 1788, \"retain everything they do not, by express\r\nterms, give up.\" In a letter written to Benjamin Lincoln, October 26,\r\n1788, he refers to the expectation that North Carolina will accede to\r\nthe Union, and adds, \"Whoever shall be found to enjoy the confidence of\r\n_the States_ so far as to be elected Vice-President,\" etc.--showing that\r\nin the \"confederated Government,\" as he termed it, the States were still\r\nto act independently, even in the selection of officers of the General\r\nGovernment. He wrote to General Knox, June 17, 1788, \"I can not but hope\r\nthat the States which may be disposed to make a secession will think\r\noften and seriously on the consequences.\" June 28, 1788, he wrote to\r\nGeneral Pinckney that New Hampshire \"had acceded to the new\r\nConfederacy,\" and, in reference to North Carolina, \"I should be\r\nastonished if that State should withdraw from the Union.\"\r\n\r\nI shall add but two other citations. They are from speeches of John\r\nMarshall, afterward the most distinguished Chief Justice of the United\r\nStates--who has certainly never been regarded as holding high views of\r\nState rights--in the Virginia Convention of 1788. In the first case, he\r\nwas speaking of the power of the States over the militia, and is thus\r\nreported:\r\n\r\n    \"The State governments did not derive their powers from the\r\n    General Government; but each government derived its powers from\r\n    the people, and each was to act according to the powers given\r\n    it. Would any gentleman deny this?... Could any man say that\r\n    this power was not retained by the States, as they had not given\r\n    it away? For (says he) does not a power remain till it is given\r\n    away? The State Legislatures had power to command and govern\r\n    their militia before, and have it still, undeniably, unless\r\n    there be something in this Constitution that takes it away....\r\n\r\n    \"He concluded by observing that the power of governing the\r\n    militia was not vested in the States by implication, because,\r\n    being possessed of it antecedently to the adoption of the\r\n    Government, and not being divested of it by any grant or\r\n    restriction in the Constitution, they must necessarily be as\r\n    fully possessed of it as ever they had been, and it could not be\r\n    said that the States derived any powers from that system, but\r\n    retained them, though not acknowledged in any part of it.\"[85]\r\n\r\nIn the other case, the special subject was the power of the Federal\r\njudiciary. Mr. Marshall said, with regard to this: \"I hope that no\r\ngentleman will think that a State can be called at the bar of the\r\nFederal court. Is there no such case at present? Are there not many\r\ncases, in which the Legislature of Virginia is a party, and yet the\r\nState is not sued? Is it rational to suppose that the sovereign power\r\nshall be dragged before a court?\"[86]\r\n\r\nAuthorities to the same effect might be multiplied indefinitely by\r\nquotation from nearly all the most eminent statesmen and patriots of\r\nthat brilliant period. My limits, however, permit me only to refer those\r\nin quest of more exhaustive information to the original records, or to\r\nthe \"Republic of Republics,\" in which will be found a most valuable\r\ncollection and condensation of the teaching of the fathers on the\r\nsubject. There was no dissent, at that period, from the interpretation\r\nof the Constitution which I have set forth, as given by its authors,\r\nexcept in the objections made by its adversaries. Those objections were\r\nrefuted and silenced, until revived, long afterward, and presented as\r\nthe true interpretation, by the school of which Judge Story was the most\r\neffective founder.\r\n\r\nAt an earlier period--but when he had already served for several years\r\nin Congress, and had attained the full maturity of his powers--Mr.\r\nWebster held the views which were presented in a memorial to Congress of\r\ncitizens of Boston, December 15, 1819, relative to the admission of\r\nMissouri, drawn up and signed by a committee of which he was chairman,\r\nand which also included among its members Mr. Josiah Quincy. He speaks\r\nof the States as enjoying \"_the exclusive possession of sovereignty_\"\r\nover their own territory, calls the United States \"the American\r\nConfederacy,\" and says, \"The only _parties to the Constitution_,\r\ncontemplated by it originally, were the _thirteen confederated States_.\"\r\nAnd again: \"As between the original States, the representation rests on\r\n_compact and plighted faith_; and your memorialists have no wish that\r\nthat compact should be disturbed, or that plighted faith in the\r\nslightest degree violated.\"\r\n\r\nIt is satisfactory to know that in the closing year of his life, when\r\nlooking retrospectively, with judgment undisturbed by any extraneous\r\ninfluence, he uttered views of the Government which must stand the test\r\nof severest scrutiny and defy the storms of agitation, for they are\r\nfounded on the rock of truth. In letters written and addresses delivered\r\nduring the Administration of Mr. Fillmore, he repeatedly applies to the\r\nConstitution the term \"compact,\" which, in 1833, he had so vehemently\r\nrepudiated. In his speech at Capon Springs, Virginia, in 1851, he says:\r\n\r\n    \"If the South were to violate any part of the Constitution\r\n    intentionally and systematically, and persist in so doing year\r\n    after year, and no remedy could be had, would the North be any\r\n    longer bound by the rest of it? And if the North were,\r\n    deliberately, habitually, and of fixed purpose, to disregard one\r\n    part of it, would the South be bound any longer to observe its\r\n    other obligations?...\r\n\r\n    \"How absurd it is to suppose that, when different parties enter\r\n    into a compact for certain purposes, either can disregard any\r\n    one provision, and expect, nevertheless, the other to observe\r\n    the rest!...\r\n\r\n    \"I have not hesitated to say, and I repeat, that, if the\r\n    Northern States refuse, willfully and deliberately, to carry\r\n    into effect that part of the Constitution which respects the\r\n    restoration of fugitive slaves, and Congress provide no remedy,\r\n    the South would no longer be bound to observe the compact. A\r\n    bargain can not be broken on one side, and still bind the other\r\n    side.\"[87]\r\n\r\nThe principles which have been set forth in the foregoing chapters,\r\nalthough they had come to be considered as peculiarly Southern, were not\r\nsectional in their origin. In the beginning and earlier years of our\r\nhistory they were cherished as faithfully and guarded as jealously in\r\nMassachusetts and New Hampshire as in Virginia or South Carolina. It was\r\nin these principles that I was nurtured. I have frankly proclaimed them\r\nduring my whole life, always contending in the Senate of the United\r\nStates against what I believed to be the mistaken construction of the\r\nConstitution taught by Mr. Webster and his adherents. While I honored\r\nthe genius of that great man, and held friendly personal relations with\r\nhim, I considered his doctrines on these points--or rather the doctrines\r\nadvocated by him during the most conspicuous and influential portions of\r\nhis public career--to be mischievous, and the more dangerous to the\r\nwelfare of the country and the liberties of mankind on account of the\r\nsignal ability and magnificent eloquence with which they were argued.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: Elliott's \"Debates,\" vol. i, p. 239; \"Madison Papers,\" pp.\r\n1119-1124.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: \"Madison Papers,\" p. 1184.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: \"Federalist,\" No. lxxxi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: \"Federalist,\" No. lxxxiv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: Ibid., No. lxxxv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Elliott's \"Debates,\" vol. iii, pp. 389-391.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Elliott's \"Debates,\" vol. iii, p. 503.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Curtis's \"Life of Webster,\" chap. xxxvii, vol. ii, pp.\r\n518, 519.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n    The Right of Secession.--The Law of Unlimited Partnerships.--The\r\n    \"Perpetual Union\" of the Articles of Confederation and the \"More\r\n    Perfect Union\" of the Constitution.--The Important Powers\r\n    conferred upon the Federal Government and the Fundamental\r\n    Principles of the Compact the same in both Systems.--The Right\r\n    to resume Grants, when failing to fulfill their Purposes,\r\n    expressly and distinctly asserted in the Adoption of the\r\n    Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Right of Secession--that subject which, beyond all others,\r\nignorance, prejudice, and political rancor have combined to cloud with\r\nmisstatements and misapprehensions--is a question easily to be\r\ndetermined in the light of what has already been established with regard\r\nto the history and principles of the Constitution. It is not something\r\nstanding apart by itself--a factious creation, outside of and\r\nantagonistic to the Constitution--as might be imagined by one deriving\r\nhis ideas from the political literature most current of late years. So\r\nfar from being against the Constitution or incompatible with it, we\r\ncontend that, if the right to secede is not prohibited to the States,\r\nand no power to prevent it expressly delegated to the United States, it\r\nremains as reserved to the States or the people, from whom all the\r\npowers of the General Government were derived.\r\n\r\nThe compact between the States which formed the Union was in the nature\r\nof a partnership between individuals without limitation of time, and the\r\nrecognized law of such partnerships is thus stated by an eminent lawyer\r\nof Massachusetts in a work intended for popular use:\r\n\r\n    \"If the articles between the partners do not contain an\r\n    agreement that the partnership shall continue for a specified\r\n    time, it may be dissolved at the pleasure of either partner. But\r\n    no partner can exercise this power wantonly and injuriously to\r\n    the other partners, without making himself responsible for the\r\n    damage he thus causes. If there be a provision that the\r\n    partnership shall continue a certain time, this is binding.\"[88]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that a number of \"sovereign, free, and independent\" States,\r\nduring the war of the Revolution, entered into a partnership with one\r\nanother, which was not only unlimited in duration, but expressly\r\ndeclared to be a \"perpetual union.\" Yet, when that Union failed to\r\naccomplish the purposes for which it was formed, the parties withdrew,\r\nseparately and independently, one after another, without any question\r\nmade of their right to do so, and formed a new association. One of the\r\ndeclared objects of this new partnership was to form \"a more perfect\r\nunion.\" This certainly did not mean more perfect in respect of duration;\r\nfor the former union had been declared perpetual, and perpetuity admits\r\nof no addition. It did not mean that it was to be more indissoluble; for\r\nthe delegates of the States, in ratifying the former compact of union,\r\nhad expressed themselves in terms that could scarcely be made more\r\nstringent. They then said:\r\n\r\n    \"And we do further _solemnly plight and engage the faith of our\r\n    respective constituents_, that they shall abide by the\r\n    determinations of the United States in Congress assembled, on\r\n    all questions which, by the said confederation, are submitted to\r\n    them; and that the articles thereof shall be _inviolably\r\n    observed_ by the States we respectively represent; and that _the\r\n    Union shall be perpetual_.\"[89]\r\n\r\nThe formation of a \"more perfect union\" was accomplished by the\r\norganization of a government more complete in its various branches,\r\nlegislative, executive, and judicial, and by the delegation to this\r\nGovernment of certain additional powers or functions which had\r\npreviously been exercised by the Governments of the respective\r\nStates--especially in providing the means of operating directly upon\r\nindividuals for the enforcement of its legitimately delegated authority.\r\nThere was no abandonment nor modification of the essential principle of\r\na _compact_ between sovereigns, which applied to the one case as fully\r\nas to the other. There was not the slightest intimation of so radical a\r\nrevolution as the surrender of the sovereignty of the contracting\r\nparties would have been. The additional powers conferred upon the\r\nFederal Government by the Constitution were merely transfers of some of\r\nthose possessed by the State governments--not subtractions from the\r\nreserved and inalienable sovereignty of the political communities which\r\nconferred them. It was merely the institution of a new agent who,\r\nhowever enlarged his powers might be, would still remain subordinate and\r\nresponsible to the source from which they were derived--that of the\r\nsovereign people of each State. It was an amended Union, not a\r\nconsolidation.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that the very powers of the Federal Government\r\nand prohibitions to the States, which are most relied upon by the\r\nadvocates of centralism as incompatible with State sovereignty, were in\r\nforce under the old Confederation when the sovereignty of the States was\r\nexpressly recognized. The General Government had then, as now, the\r\nexclusive right and power of determining on peace and war, making\r\ntreaties and alliances, maintaining an army and navy, granting letters\r\nof marque and reprisal, regulating coinage, establishing and controlling\r\nthe postal service--indeed, nearly all the so-called \"characteristic\r\npowers of sovereignty\" exercised by the Federal Government under the\r\nexisting Constitution, except the regulation of commerce, and of levying\r\nand collecting its revenues directly, instead of through the\r\ninterposition of the State authorities. The exercise of these\r\nfirst-named powers was prohibited to the States under the old compact,\r\n\"without the consent of the United States in Congress assembled,\" but no\r\none has claimed that the Confederation had thereby acquired sovereignty.\r\n\r\nEntirely in accord with these truths are the arguments of Mr. Madison in\r\nthe \"Federalist,\" to show that the great principles of the Constitution\r\nare substantially the same as those of the Articles of Confederation. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    \"I ask, What are these principles? Do they require that, in the\r\n    establishment of the Constitution, the States should be regarded\r\n    as distinct and independent sovereigns? They _are_ so regarded\r\n    by the Constitution proposed.... Do these principles, in fine,\r\n    require that the powers of the General Government should be\r\n    limited, and that, beyond this limit, the States should be left\r\n    in possession of their sovereignty and independence? We have\r\n    seen that, in the new Government as in the old, the general\r\n    powers are limited; and that the States, in all unenumerated\r\n    cases, are left in the enjoyment of their sovereign and\r\n    independent jurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\n\"The truth is,\" he adds, \"that the great principles of the Constitution\r\nproposed by the Convention may be considered _less as absolutely new,\r\nthan as the expansion of principles which are found in the Articles of\r\nConfederation_.\"[90]\r\n\r\nIn the papers immediately following, he establishes this position in\r\ndetail by an analysis of the principal powers delegated to the Federal\r\nGovernment, showing that the spirit of the original instructions to the\r\nConvention had been followed in revising \"the Federal Constitution\" and\r\nrendering it \"adequate to the exigencies of government and the\r\npreservation of the Union.\"[91]\r\n\r\nThe present Union owes its very existence to the dissolution, by\r\nseparate secession of its members, of the former Union, which, as we\r\nhave thus seen, as to its _organic principles_, rested upon precisely\r\nthe same foundation. The right to withdraw from the association results,\r\nin either case, from the same principles--principles which, I think,\r\nhave been established on an impregnable basis of history, reason, law,\r\nand precedent.\r\n\r\nIt is not contended that this right should be resorted to for\r\ninsufficient cause, or, as the writer already quoted on the law of\r\npartnership says, \"wantonly and injuriously to the other partners,\"\r\nwithout responsibility of the seceding party for any damage thus done.\r\nNo association can be dissolved without a likelihood of the occurrence\r\nof incidental questions concerning common property and mutual\r\nobligations--questions sometimes of a complex and intricate sort. If a\r\nwrong be perpetrated, in such case, it is a matter for determination by\r\nthe means usually employed among independent and sovereign\r\npowers--negotiation, arbitration, or, in the failure of these, by war,\r\nwith which, unfortunately, Christianity and civilization have not yet\r\nbeen able entirely to dispense. But the suggestion of possible evils\r\ndoes not at all affect the question of right. There is no great\r\nprinciple in the affairs either of individuals or of nations that is not\r\nliable to such difficulties in its practical application.\r\n\r\nBut, we are told, there is no mention made of secession in the\r\nConstitution. Mr. Everett says: \"The States are not named in it; the\r\nword sovereignty does not occur in it; the right of secession is as much\r\nignored in it as the procession of the equinoxes.\" We have seen how very\r\nuntenable is the assertion that the States are not named in it, and how\r\nmuch pertinency or significance in the omission of the _word_\r\n\"sovereignty.\" The pertinent question that occurs is, Why was so obvious\r\nan attribute of sovereignty not expressly renounced if it was intended\r\nto surrender it? It certainly existed; it was not surrendered; therefore\r\nit still exists. This would be a more natural and rational conclusion\r\nthan that it has ceased to exist because it is not mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe simple truth is, that it would have been a very extraordinary thing\r\nto incorporate into the Constitution any express provision for the\r\nsecession of the States and dissolution of the Union. Its founders\r\nundoubtedly desired and hoped that it would be perpetual; against the\r\nproposition for power to coerce a State, the argument was that it would\r\nbe a means, not of preserving, but of destroying, the Union. It was not\r\nfor them to make arrangements for its termination--a calamity which\r\nthere was no occasion to provide for in advance. Sufficient for their\r\nday was the evil thereof. It is not usual, either in partnerships\r\nbetween men or in treaties between governments, to make provision for a\r\ndissolution of the partnership or a termination of the treaty, unless\r\nthere be some special reason for a limitation of time. Indeed, in\r\ntreaties, the usual formula includes a declaration of their\r\n_perpetuity_; but in either case the power of the contracting parties,\r\nor of any of them, to dissolve the compact, on terms not damaging to the\r\nrights of the other parties, is not the less clearly understood. It was\r\nnot necessary in the Constitution to affirm the right of secession,\r\nbecause it was an attribute of sovereignty, and the States had reserved\r\nall which they had not delegated.\r\n\r\nThe right of the people of the several States to resume the powers\r\ndelegated by them to the common agency, was not left without positive\r\nand ample assertion, even at a period when it had never been denied. The\r\nratification of the Constitution by Virginia has already been quoted, in\r\nwhich the people of that State, through their Convention, did expressly\r\n\"declare and make known that the powers granted under the Constitution,\r\nbeing derived from the people of the United States, _may be resumed by\r\nthem_, whensoever the same shall be perverted to their injury or\r\noppression, and that every power not granted thereby remains with them\r\nand at their will.\"[92]\r\n\r\nNew York and Rhode Island were no less explicit, both declaring that\r\n\"the powers of government _may be reassumed by the people_ whenever it\r\nshall become necessary to their happiness.\"[93]\r\n\r\nThese expressions are not mere _obiter dicta_, thrown out incidentally,\r\nand entitled only to be regarded as an expression of opinion by their\r\nauthors. Even if only such, they would carry great weight as the\r\ndeliberately expressed judgment of enlightened contemporaries, but they\r\nare more: they are parts of the very acts or ordinances by which these\r\nStates ratified the Constitution and acceded to the Union, and can not\r\nbe detached from them. If they are invalid, the ratification itself was\r\ninvalid, for they are inseparable. By inserting these declarations in\r\ntheir ordinances, Virginia, New York, and Rhode Island, formally,\r\nofficially, and permanently, declared their interpretation of the\r\nConstitution as recognizing the right of secession by the resumption of\r\ntheir grants. By accepting the ratifications with this declaration\r\nincorporated, the other States as formally accepted the principle which\r\nit asserted.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that it has been attempted to construe these\r\ndeclarations concerning the right of _the people_ to reassume their\r\ndelegations of power--especially in the terms employed by Virginia,\r\n\"people of the United States\"--as having reference to the idea of _one\r\npeople_, in mass, or \"in the aggregate.\" But it can scarcely be possible\r\nthat any candid and intelligent reader, who has carefully considered the\r\nevidence already brought to bear on the subject, can need further\r\nargument to disabuse his mind of that political fiction. The \"people of\r\nthe United States,\" from whom the powers of the Federal Government were\r\n\"derived,\" _could have been_ no other than the people who ordained and\r\nratified the Constitution; and this, it has been shown beyond the power\r\nof denial, was done by the people of _each State_, severally and\r\nindependently. No other _people_ were known to the authors of the\r\ndeclarations above quoted. Mr. Madison was a leading member of the\r\nVirginia Convention, which made that declaration, as well as of the\r\ngeneral Convention that drew up the Constitution. We have seen what\r\n_his_ idea of \"the people of the United States\" was--\"not the people as\r\ncomposing one great body, but the people as composing thirteen\r\nsovereignties.\"[94] Mr. Lee, of Westmoreland (\"Light-Horse Harry\"), in\r\nthe same Convention, answering Mr. Henry's objection to the expression,\r\n\"We, the people,\" said: \"It [the Constitution] is now submitted to _the\r\npeople of Virginia_. If we do not adopt it, it will be always null and\r\nvoid as to us. Suppose it was found proper for our adoption, and\r\nbecoming the government of _the people of Virginia_, by what style\r\nshould it be done? Ought we not to make use of the name of the people?\r\nNo other style would be proper.\"[95] It would certainly be superfluous,\r\nafter all that has been presented heretofore, to add any further\r\nevidence of the meaning that was attached to these expressions by their\r\nauthors. \"The people of the United States\" were in their minds the\r\npeople of Virginia, the people of Massachusetts, and the people of every\r\nother State that should agree to unite. They _could_ have meant only\r\nthat the people of their respective States who had delegated certain\r\npowers to the Federal Government, in ratifying the Constitution and\r\n_acceding_ to the Union, reserved to themselves the right, in event of\r\nthe failure of their purposes, to \"resume\" (or \"reassume\") those powers\r\nby _seceding_ from the same Union.\r\n\r\nFinally, the absurdity of the construction attempted to be put upon\r\nthese expressions will be evident from a very brief analysis. If the\r\nassertion of the right of reassumption of their powers was meant for the\r\nprotection of _the whole people_--the people in mass--the people \"in the\r\naggregate\"--of a consolidated republic--against whom or what was it to\r\nprotect them? By whom were the powers granted to be perverted to the\r\ninjury or oppression of the whole people? By themselves or by some of\r\nthe States, all of whom, according to this hypothesis, had been\r\nconsolidated into one? As no danger could have been apprehended from\r\neither of these, it must have been against the _Government_ of the\r\nUnited States that the provision was made; that is to say, the whole\r\npeople of a republic make this declaration against a Government\r\nestablished by themselves and entirely subject to their own control,\r\nunder a Constitution which contains provision for its own amendment by\r\nthis very same \"whole people,\" whenever they may think proper! Is it not\r\na libel upon the statesmen of that generation to attribute to their\r\ngrave and solemn declarations a meaning so vapid and absurd?\r\n\r\nTo those who argue that the grants of the Constitution are fatal to the\r\nreservation of sovereignty by the States, the Constitution furnishes a\r\nconclusive answer in the amendment which was coeval with the adoption of\r\nthe instrument, and which declares that all powers not delegated to the\r\nGovernment of the Union were reserved to the States or to the people. As\r\nsovereignty was not delegated by the States, it was necessarily\r\nreserved. It would be superfluous to answer arguments against implied\r\npowers of the States; none are claimed by implication, because all not\r\ndelegated by the States remained with them, and it was only in an\r\nabundance of caution that they expressed the right to resume such parts\r\nof their unlimited power as was delegated for the purposes enumerated.\r\nAs there be those who see danger to the perpetuity of the Union in the\r\npossession of such power by the States, and insist that our fathers did\r\nnot intend to bind the States together by a compact no better than \"a\r\nrope of sand,\" it may be well to examine their position. From what have\r\ndangers to the Union arisen? Have they sprang from too great restriction\r\non the exercise of the granted powers, or from the assumption by the\r\nGeneral Government of power claimed by implication? The whole record of\r\nour Union answers, from the latter only.\r\n\r\nWas this tendency to usurpation caused by the presumption of paramount\r\nauthority in the General Government, or by the assertion of the right of\r\na State to resume the powers it had delegated? Reasonably and honestly\r\nit can not be assigned to the latter. Let it be supposed that the \"whole\r\npeople\" had recognized the right of a State of the Union, peaceably and\r\nindependently, to resume the powers which, peaceably and independently,\r\nshe had delegated to the Federal Government, would not this have been\r\npotent to restrain the General Government from exercising its functions\r\nto the injury and oppression of such State? To deny that effect would be\r\nto suppose that a dominant majority would be willing to drive a State\r\nfrom the Union. Would the admission of the right of a State to resume\r\nthe grants it had made, have led to the exercise of that right for light\r\nand trivial causes? Surely the evidence furnished by the nations, both\r\nancient and modern, refutes the supposition. In the language of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, \"All experience hath shown that mankind are\r\nmore disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right\r\nthemselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.\" Would\r\nnot real grievances be rendered more tolerable by the consciousness of\r\npower to remove them; and would not even imaginary wrongs be embittered\r\nby the manifestation of a purpose to make them perpetual? To ask these\r\nquestions is to answer them.\r\n\r\nThe wise and brave men who had, at much peril and great sacrifice,\r\nsecured the independence of the States, were as little disposed to\r\nsurrender the sovereignty of the States as they were anxious to organize\r\na General Government with adequate powers to remedy the defects of the\r\nConfederation. The Union they formed was not to destroy the States, but\r\nto \"secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: Parsons, \"Rights of a Citizen,\" chap. xx, section 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: Ratification appended to Articles of Confederation.

That is to say, if no such\r\nright as that of secession exists--if it is forbidden or precluded by\r\nthe Constitution--then it is a wrong; and, by a well settled principle\r\nof public law, for every wrong there must be a remedy, which in this\r\ncase must be the application of force to the State attempting to\r\nwithdraw from the Union.\r\n\r\nEarly in the session of the Convention which formed the Constitution, it\r\nwas proposed to confer upon Congress the power \"to call forth the force\r\nof the Union against any member of the Union failing to fulfill its duty\r\nunder the articles thereof.\" When this proposition came to be\r\nconsidered, Mr. Madison observed that \"a union of the States containing\r\nsuch an ingredient seemed to provide for its own destruction. The use of\r\nforce against a State would look more like a declaration of war than an\r\ninfliction of punishment, and would probably be considered by the party\r\nattacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might be\r\nbound. He hoped that such a system would be framed as might render this\r\nrecourse unnecessary, and moved that the clause be postponed.\" This\r\nmotion was adopted _nem. con._, and the proposition was never again\r\nrevived.[96] Again, on a subsequent occasion, speaking of an appeal to\r\nforce, Mr. Madison said: \"Was such a remedy eligible? Was it\r\npracticable?... Any government for the United States, formed on the\r\nsupposed practicability of using force against the unconstitutional\r\nproceedings of the States, would prove as visionary and fallacious as\r\nthe government of Congress.\"[97] Every proposition looking in any way to\r\nthe same or a similar object was promptly rejected by the convention.\r\nGeorge Mason, of Virginia, said of such a proposition: \"Will not the\r\ncitizens of the invaded State assist one another, until they rise as one\r\nman and shake off the Union altogether?\"[98]\r\n\r\nOliver Ellsworth, in the ratifying Convention of Connecticut, said:\r\n\"This Constitution does not attempt to coerce _sovereign bodies,\r\nStates_, in their political capacity. No coercion is applicable to such\r\nbodies but that of an armed force. If we should attempt to execute the\r\nlaws of the Union by sending an armed force against a delinquent State,\r\nit would involve the good and bad, the innocent and guilty, in the same\r\ncalamity.\"[99]\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton, in the Convention of New York, said: \"To coerce the States\r\nis one of the maddest projects that was ever devised.... What picture\r\ndoes this idea present to our view? A complying State at war with a\r\nnon-complying State: Congress marching the troops of one State into the\r\nbosom of another ... Here is a nation at war with itself. Can any\r\nreasonable man be well disposed toward a government which makes war and\r\ncarnage the only means of supporting itself--a government that can exist\r\nonly by the sword?... But can we believe that one State will ever suffer\r\nitself to be used as an instrument of coercion? The thing is a dream--it\r\nis impossible.\"[100]\r\n\r\nUnhappily, our generation has seen that, in the decay of the principles\r\nand feelings which animated the hearts of all patriots in that day, this\r\nthing, like many others then regarded as impossible dreams, has been\r\nonly too feasible, and that States have permitted themselves to be used\r\nas instruments, not merely for the coercion, but for the destruction of\r\nthe freedom and independence of their sister States.\r\n\r\nEdmund Randolph, Governor of Virginia, although the mover of the\r\noriginal proposition to authorize the employment of the forces of the\r\nUnion against a delinquent member, which had been so signally defeated\r\nin the Federal Convention, afterward, in the Virginia Convention, made\r\nan eloquent protest against the idea of the employment of force against\r\na State. \"What species of military coercion,\" said he, \"could the\r\nGeneral Government adopt for the enforcement of obedience to its\r\ndemands? Either an army sent into the heart of a delinquent State, or\r\nblocking up its ports. Have we lived to this, then, that, in order to\r\nsuppress and exclude tyranny, it is necessary to render the most\r\naffectionate friends the most bitter enemies, set the father against the\r\nson, and make the brother slay the brother? Is this the happy expedient\r\nthat is to preserve liberty? Will it not destroy it? If an army be once\r\nintroduced to force us, if once marched into Virginia, figure to\r\nyourselves what the dreadful consequence will be: the most lamentable\r\ncivil war must ensue.\"[101]\r\n\r\nWe have seen already how vehemently the idea of even _judicial_ coercion\r\nwas repudiated by Hamilton, Marshall, and others. The suggestion of\r\n_military_ coercion was uniformly treated, as in the above extracts,\r\nwith still more abhorrence. No principle was more fully and firmly\r\nsettled on the highest authority than that, under our system, there\r\ncould be no coercion of a State.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster, in his elaborate speech of February 16, 1833, arguing\r\nthroughout against the sovereignty of the States, and in the course of\r\nhis argument sadly confounding the ideas of the Federal Constitution and\r\nthe Federal Government, as he confounds the sovereign people of the\r\nStates with the State governments, says: \"The States _can not_ omit to\r\nappoint Senators and electors. It is not a matter resting in State\r\ndiscretion or State pleasure.... No member of a State Legislature can\r\nrefuse to proceed, at the proper time, to elect Senators to Congress, or\r\nto provide for the choice of electors of President and Vice-President,\r\nany more than the members can refuse, when the appointed day arrives, to\r\nmeet the members of the other House, to count the votes for those\r\nofficers and ascertain who are chosen.\"[102] This was before the\r\ninvention in 1877 of an electoral commission to relieve Congress of its\r\nconstitutional duty to count the vote. Mr. Hamilton, on the contrary,\r\nfresh from the work of forming the Constitution, and familiar with its\r\nprinciples and purposes, said: \"It is certainly true that the State\r\nLegislatures, by forbearing the appointment of Senators, may destroy the\r\nnational Government.\"[103]\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to discuss the particular question on which these two\r\ngreat authorities are thus directly at issue. I do not contend that the\r\nState Legislatures, of their own will, have a right to forego the\r\nperformance of any Federal duty imposed upon them by the Constitution.\r\nBut there is a power beyond and above that of either the Federal or\r\nState governments--the power of the people of the State, who ordained\r\nand established the Constitution, as far as it applies to themselves,\r\nreserving, as I think has been demonstrated, the right to reassume the\r\ngrants of power therein made, when they deem it necessary for their\r\nsafety or welfare to do so. At the behest of this power, it certainly\r\nbecomes not only the right, but the duty, of their State Legislature to\r\nrefrain from any action implying adherence to the Union, or partnership,\r\nfrom which the sovereign has withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: \"Madison Papers,\" pp. 732, 761.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: Ibid., p. 822.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: Ibid., p. 914.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: Elliott's \"Debates,\" vol. ii, p. 199.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: Ibid., pp. 232, 233.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: Elliott's \"Debates,\" vol. iii, p. 117.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: \"Congressional Debates,\" vol. ix, Part I, p. 566.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: \"Federalist,\" No. lix.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n    Some Objections considered.--The New States.--Acquired\r\n    Territory.--Allegiance, false and true.--Difference between\r\n    Nullification and Secession.--Secession a Peaceable Remedy.--No\r\n    Appeal to Arms.--Two Conditions noted.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be only adding to a superabundance of testimony to quote\r\nfurther from the authors of the Constitution in support of the\r\nprinciple, unquestioned in that generation, that the people who\r\ngranted--that is to say, of course, the people of the several\r\nStates--might resume their grants. It will require but few words to\r\ndispose of some superficial objections that have been made to the\r\napplication of this doctrine in a special case.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that, whatever weight may attach to principles\r\nfounded on the sovereignty and independence of the original thirteen\r\nStates, they can not apply to the States of more recent\r\norigin--constituting now a majority of the members of the Union--because\r\nthese are but the offspring or creatures of the Union, and must of\r\ncourse be subordinate and dependent.\r\n\r\nThis objection would scarcely occur to any instructed mind, though it\r\nmay possess a certain degree of specious plausibility for the untaught.\r\nIt is enough to answer that the entire equality of the States, in every\r\nparticular, is a vital condition of their union. Every new member that\r\nhas been admitted into the partnership of States came in, as is\r\nexpressly declared in the acts for their admission, on a footing of\r\nperfect equality in every respect with the original members. This\r\nequality is as complete as the equality, before the laws, of the son\r\nwith the father, immediately on the attainment by the former of his\r\nlegal majority, without regard to the prior condition of dependence and\r\ntutelage. The relations of the original States to one another and to the\r\nUnion can not be affected by any subsequent accessions of new members,\r\nas the Constitution fixes those relations permanently, and furnishes the\r\nnormal standard which is applicable to all. The Boston memorial to\r\nCongress, referred to in a foregoing chapter, as prepared by a committee\r\nwith Mr. Webster at its head, says that the new States \"are universally\r\nconsidered as admitted into the Union upon the same footing as the\r\noriginal States, and as possessing, in respect to the Union, the same\r\nrights of _sovereignty, freedom, and independence_, as the other\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nBut, with regard to States formed of territory acquired by purchase from\r\nFrance, Spain, and Mexico, it is claimed that, as they were bought by\r\nthe United States, they belong to the same, and have no right to\r\nwithdraw at will from an association the property which had been\r\npurchased by the other parties.\r\n\r\nHappy would it have been if the equal rights of the people of _all_ the\r\nStates to the enjoyment of territory acquired by the common treasure\r\ncould have been recognized at the proper time! There would then have\r\nbeen no secession and no war.\r\n\r\nAs for the sordid claim of ownership of States, on account of the money\r\nspent for the land which they contain--I can understand the ground of a\r\nclaim to some interest in the soil, so long as it continues to be public\r\nproperty, but have yet to learn in what way the United States ever\r\nbecame purchaser of the _inhabitants_ or of their political rights.\r\n\r\nAny question in regard to property has always been admitted to be matter\r\nfor fair and equitable settlement, in case of the withdrawal of a State.\r\n\r\nThe treaty by which the Louisiana territory was ceded to the United\r\nStates expressly provided that the inhabitants thereof should be\r\n\"admitted, as soon as possible, according to the principles of the\r\nFederal Constitution, to the enjoyment of all the rights, advantages,\r\nand immunities of citizens of the United States.\"[104] In all other\r\nacquisitions of territory the same stipulation is either expressed or\r\nimplied. Indeed, the denial of the right would be inconsistent with the\r\ncharacter of American political institutions.\r\n\r\nAnother objection made to the right of secession is based upon obscure,\r\nindefinite, and inconsistent ideas with regard to _allegiance_. It\r\nassumes various shapes, and is therefore somewhat difficult to meet,\r\nbut, as most frequently presented, may be stated thus: that the citizen\r\nowes a double allegiance, or a divided allegiance--partly to his State,\r\npartly to the United States: that it is not possible for either of these\r\npowers to release him from the allegiance due to the other: that the\r\nState can no more release him from his obligations to the Union than the\r\nUnited States can absolve him from his duties to his State. This is the\r\nmost moderate way in which the objection is put. The extreme\r\ncentralizers go further, and claim that allegiance to the Union, or, as\r\nthey generally express it, to _the Government_--meaning thereby the\r\nFederal Government--is paramount, and the obligation to the State only\r\nsubsidiary--if, indeed, it exists at all.\r\n\r\nThis latter view, if the more monstrous, is at least the more consistent\r\nof the two, for it does not involve the difficulty of a divided\r\nallegiance, nor the paradoxical position in which the other places the\r\ncitizen, in case of a conflict between his State and the other members\r\nof the Union, of being necessarily a rebel against the General\r\nGovernment or a traitor to the State of which he is a citizen.\r\n\r\nAs to _true_ allegiance, in the light of the principles which have been\r\nestablished, there can be no doubt with regard to it. The primary,\r\nparamount allegiance of the citizen is due to the sovereign only. That\r\nsovereign, under our system, is the people--the people of the State to\r\nwhich he belongs--the people who constituted the State government which\r\nhe obeys, and which protects him in the enjoyment of his personal\r\nrights--the people who alone (as far as he is concerned) ordained and\r\nestablished the Federal Constitution and Federal Government--the people\r\nwho have reserved to themselves sovereignty, which involves the power to\r\nrevoke all agencies created by them. The obligation to support the State\r\nor Federal Constitution and the obedience due to either State or Federal\r\nGovernment are alike derived from and dependent on the allegiance due to\r\nthis sovereign. If the sovereign abolishes the State government and\r\nordains and establishes a new one, the obligation of allegiance requires\r\nhim to transfer his obedience accordingly. If the sovereign withdraws\r\nfrom association with its confederates in the Union, the allegiance of\r\nthe citizen requires him to follow the sovereign. Any other course is\r\nrebellion or treason--words which, in the cant of the day, have been so\r\ngrossly misapplied and perverted as to be made worse than unmeaning. His\r\nrelation to the Union arose from the membership of the State of which he\r\nwas a citizen, and ceased whenever his State withdrew from it. He can\r\nnot owe obedience--much less allegiance--to an association from which\r\nhis sovereign has separated, and thereby withdrawn him.\r\n\r\nEvery officer of both Federal and State governments is required to take\r\nan oath to support the Constitution, a compact the binding force of\r\nwhich is based upon the sovereignty of the States--a sovereignty\r\nnecessarily carrying with it the principles just stated with regard to\r\nallegiance. Every such officer is, therefore, virtually sworn to\r\nmaintain and support the sovereignty of all the States.\r\n\r\nMilitary and naval officers take, in addition, an oath to obey the\r\nlawful orders of their superiors. Such an oath has never been understood\r\nto be eternal in its obligations. It is dissolved by the death,\r\ndismissal, or resignation of the officer who takes it; and such\r\nresignation is not a mere optional right, but becomes an imperative duty\r\nwhen continuance in the service comes to be in conflict with the\r\nultimate allegiance due to the sovereignty of the State to which he\r\nbelongs.\r\n\r\nA little consideration of these plain and irrefutable truths would show\r\nhow utterly unworthy and false are the vulgar taunts which attribute\r\n\"treason\" to those who, in the late secession of the Southern States,\r\nwere loyal to the only sovereign entitled to their allegiance, and which\r\nstill more absurdly prate of the violation of oaths to support \"_the\r\nGovernment_,\" an oath which nobody ever could have been legally required\r\nto take, and which must have been ignorantly confounded with the\r\nprescribed oath to support the Constitution.\r\n\r\nNullification and secession are often erroneously treated as if they\r\nwere one and the same thing. It is true that both ideas spring from the\r\nsovereign right of a State to interpose for the protection of its own\r\npeople, but they are altogether unlike as to both their extent and the\r\ncharacter of the means to be employed. The first was a temporary\r\nexpedient, intended to restrain action until the question at issue could\r\nbe submitted to a convention of the States. It was a remedy which its\r\nsupporters sought to apply within the Union; a means to avoid the last\r\nresort--separation. If the application for a convention should fail, or\r\nif the State making it should suffer an adverse decision, the advocates\r\nof that remedy have not revealed what they proposed as the next\r\nstep--supposing the infraction of the compact to have been of that\r\ncharacter which, according to Mr. Webster, dissolved it.\r\n\r\nSecession, on the other hand, was the assertion of the inalienable right\r\nof a people to change their government, whenever it ceased to fulfill\r\nthe purposes for which it was ordained and established. Under our form\r\nof government, and the cardinal principles upon which it was founded, it\r\nshould have been a peaceful remedy. The withdrawal of a State from a\r\nleague has no revolutionary or insurrectionary characteristic. The\r\ngovernment of the State remains unchanged as to all internal affairs. It\r\nis only its external or confederate relations that are altered. To term\r\nthis action of a sovereign a \"rebellion,\" is a gross abuse of language.\r\nSo is the flippant phrase which speaks of it as an appeal to the\r\n\"arbitrament of the sword.\" In the late contest, in particular, there\r\nwas no appeal by the seceding States to the arbitrament of arms. There\r\nwas on their part no invitation nor provocation to war. They stood in an\r\nattitude of self-defense, and were attacked for merely exercising a\r\nright guaranteed by the original terms of the compact. They neither\r\ntendered nor accepted any challenge to the wager of battle. The man who\r\ndefends his house against attack can not with any propriety be said to\r\nhave submitted the question of his right to it to the arbitrament of\r\narms.\r\n\r\nTwo moral obligations or restrictions upon a seceding State certainly\r\nexist: in the first place, not to break up the partnership without good\r\nand sufficient cause; and, in the second, to make an equitable\r\nsettlement with former associates, and, as far as may be, to avoid the\r\ninfliction of loss or damage upon any of them. Neither of these\r\nobligations was violated or neglected by the Southern States in their\r\nsecession.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: Ray's \"Louisiana Digest,\" vol. i, p. 24.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n    Early Foreshadowings.--Opinions of Mr. Madison and Mr. Rufus\r\n    King.--Safeguards provided.--Their Failure.--State\r\n    Interposition.--The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions.--Their\r\n    Endorsement by the People in the Presidential Elections of 1800\r\n    and Ensuing Terms.--South Carolina and Mr. Calhoun.--The\r\n    Compromise of 1833.--Action of Massachusetts in\r\n    1843-'45.--Opinions of John Quincy Adams.--Necessity for\r\n    Secession.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest period, it was foreseen by the wisest of our statesmen\r\nthat a danger to the perpetuity of the Union would arise from the\r\nconflicting interests of different sections, and every effort was made\r\nto secure each of these classes of interests against aggression by the\r\nother. As a proof of this, may be cited the following extract from Mr.\r\nMadison's report of a speech made by himself in the Philadelphia\r\nConvention on the 30th of June, 1787:\r\n\r\n    \"He admitted that every peculiar interest, whether in any class\r\n    of citizens or any description of States, ought to be secured as\r\n    far as possible. Wherever there is danger of attack, there ought\r\n    to be given a constitutional power of defense. But he contended\r\n    that the States were divided into different interests, not by\r\n    their difference of size, but by other circumstances; the most\r\n    material of which resulted from climate, but principally from\r\n    the effects of their having or not having slaves. These two\r\n    causes concurred in forming the great division of interests in\r\n    the United States. It did not lie between the large and small\r\n    States; it lay between the Northern and Southern; and, if any\r\n    defensive power were necessary, it ought to be mutually given to\r\n    these two interests.\"[105]\r\n\r\nMr. Rufus King, a distinguished member of the Convention from\r\nMassachusetts, a few days afterward, said, to the same effect: \"He was\r\nfully convinced that the question concerning a difference of interests\r\ndid not lie where it had hitherto been discussed, between the great and\r\nsmall States, but between the Southern and Eastern. For this reason he\r\nhad been ready to yield something, in the proportion of representatives,\r\nfor the security of the Southern.... He was not averse to giving them a\r\nstill greater security, but did not see how it could be done.\"[106]\r\n\r\nThe wise men who formed the Constitution were not seeking to bind the\r\nStates together by the material power of a majority; nor were they so\r\nblind to the influences of passion and interest as to believe that paper\r\nbarriers would suffice to restrain a majority actuated by either or both\r\nof these motives. They endeavored, therefore, to prevent the conflicts\r\ninevitable from the ascendancy of a sectional or party majority, by so\r\ndistributing the powers of government that each interest might hold a\r\ncheck upon the other. It was believed that the compromises made with\r\nregard to representation--securing to each State an equal vote in the\r\nSenate, and in the House of Representatives giving the States a weight\r\nin proportion to their respective population, estimating the negroes as\r\nequivalent to three fifths of the same number of free whites--would have\r\nthe effect of giving at an early period a majority in the House of\r\nRepresentatives to the South, while the North would retain the\r\nascendancy in the Senate. Thus it was supposed that the two great\r\nsectional interests would be enabled to restrain each other within the\r\nlimits of purposes and action beneficial to both.\r\n\r\nThe failure of these expectations need not affect our reverence for the\r\nintentions of the fathers, or our respect for the means which they\r\ndevised to carry them into effect. That they were mistaken, both as to\r\nthe maintenance of the balance of sectional power and as to the fidelity\r\nand integrity with which the Congress was expected to conform to the\r\nletter and spirit of its delegated authority, is perhaps to be ascribed\r\nless to lack of prophetic foresight, than to that over-sanguine\r\nconfidence which is the weakness of honest minds, and which was\r\nnaturally strengthened by the patriotic and fraternal feelings resulting\r\nfrom the great struggle through which they had then but recently passed.\r\nThey saw, in the sufficiency of the authority delegated to the Federal\r\nGovernment and in the fullness of the sovereignty retained by the\r\nStates, a system the strict construction of which was so eminently\r\nadapted to indefinite expansion of the confederacy as to embrace every\r\nvariety of production and consequent diversity of pursuit. Carried out\r\nin the spirit in which it was devised, there was in this system no\r\nelement of disintegration, but every facility for an enlargement of the\r\ncircle of the family of States (or nations), so that it scarcely seemed\r\nunreasonable to look forward to a fulfillment of the aspiration of Mr.\r\nHamilton, that it might extend over North America, perhaps over the\r\nwhole continent.\r\n\r\nNot at all incompatible with these views and purposes was the\r\nrecognition of the right of the States to reassume, if occasion should\r\nrequire it, the powers which they had delegated. On the contrary, the\r\nmaintenance of this right was the surest guarantee of the perpetuity of\r\nthe Union, and the denial of it sounded the first serious note of its\r\ndissolution. The conservative efficiency of \"_State interposition_,\" for\r\nmaintenance of the essential principles of the Union against aggression\r\nor decadence, is one of the most conspicuous features in the debates of\r\nthe various State Conventions by which the Constitution was ratified.\r\nPerhaps their ideas of the particular form in which this interposition\r\nwas to be made may have been somewhat indefinite; and left to be reduced\r\nto shape by the circumstances when they should arise, but the principle\r\nitself was assumed and asserted as fundamental. But for a firm reliance\r\nupon it, as a sure resort in case of need, it may safely be said that\r\nthe Union would never have been formed. It would be unjust to the wisdom\r\nand sagacity of the framers of the Constitution to suppose that they\r\nentirely relied on paper barriers for the protection of the rights of\r\nminorities. Fresh from the defense of violated charters and faithless\r\naggression on inalienable rights, it might, _a priori_, be assumed that\r\nthey would require something more potential than mere promises to\r\nprotect them from human depravity and human ambition. That they did so\r\nis to be found in the debates both of the General and the State\r\nConventions, where State interposition was often declared to be the\r\nbulwark against usurpation.\r\n\r\nAt an early period in the history of the Federal Government, the States\r\nof Kentucky and Virginia found reason to reassert this right of State\r\ninterposition. In the first of the famous resolutions drawn by Mr.\r\nJefferson in 1798, and with some modification adopted by the Legislature\r\nof Kentucky in November of that year, it is declared that, \"whensoever\r\nthe General Government assumes undelegated powers, its acts are\r\n_unauthoritative, void, and of no force_; that to this compact each\r\nState acceded as a State, and is an integral party; that this\r\nGovernment, created by this compact, was not made the exclusive or final\r\njudge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself; since that would\r\nhave made its discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its\r\npowers; but that, as in all other cases of compact among parties having\r\nno common judge, _each party has an equal right to judge for itself, as\r\nwell of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Virginia resolutions, drawn by Mr. Madison, adopted on the 24th\r\nof December, 1798, and reaffirmed in 1799, the General Assembly of that\r\nState declares that \"it views the powers of the Federal Government as\r\nresulting from the compact, to which the States are parties, as limited\r\nby the plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting that\r\ncompact, as no further valid than they are authorized by the grants\r\nenumerated in that compact; and that, in case of a deliberate, palpable,\r\nand dangerous exercise of other powers, not granted by the said compact,\r\nthe States, who are parties thereto, have the right, and are in duty\r\nbound, to interpose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and for\r\nmaintaining within their respective limits the authorities, rights, and\r\nliberties, appertaining to them.\" Another of the same series of\r\nresolutions denounces the indications of a design \"to consolidate the\r\nStates by degrees into one sovereignty.\"\r\n\r\nThese, it is true, were only the resolves of two States, and they were\r\ndissented from by several other State Legislatures--not so much on the\r\nground of opposition to the general principles asserted as on that of\r\ntheir being unnecessary in their application to the alien and sedition\r\nlaws, which were the immediate occasion of their utterance.\r\nNevertheless, they were the basis of the contest for the Presidency in\r\n1800, which resulted in their approval by the people in the triumphant\r\nelection of Mr. Jefferson. They became part of the accepted creed of the\r\nRepublican, Democratic, State-Rights, or Conservative party, as it has\r\nbeen variously termed at different periods, and as such they were\r\nratified by the people in every Presidential election that took place\r\nfor sixty years, with two exceptions. The last victory obtained under\r\nthem, and when they were emphasized by adding the construction of them\r\ncontained in the report of Mr. Madison to the Virginia Legislature in\r\n1799, was at the election of Mr. Buchanan--the last President chosen by\r\nvote of a party that could with any propriety be styled \"national,\" in\r\ncontradistinction to sectional.\r\n\r\nAt a critical and memorable period, that pure spirit, luminous\r\nintellect, and devoted adherent of the Constitution, the great statesman\r\nof South Carolina, invoked this remedy of State interposition against\r\nthe Tariff Act of 1828, which was deemed injurious and oppressive to his\r\nState. No purpose was then declared to coerce the State, as such, but\r\nmeasures were taken to break the protective shield of her authority and\r\nenforce the laws of Congress upon her citizens, by compelling them to\r\npay outside of her ports the duties on imports, which the State had\r\ndeclared unconstitutional, and had forbidden to be collected in her\r\nports.\r\n\r\nThere remained at that day enough of the spirit in which the Union had\r\nbeen founded--enough of respect for the sovereignty of States and of\r\nregard for the limitations of the Constitution--to prevent a conflict of\r\narms. The compromise of 1833 was adopted, which South Carolina agreed to\r\naccept, the principle for which she contended being virtually conceded.\r\n\r\nMeantime there had been no lack, as we have already seen, of assertions\r\nof the sovereign rights of the States from other quarters. The\r\ndeclaration of these rights by the New England States and their\r\nrepresentatives, on the acquisition of Louisiana in 1803, on the\r\nadmission of the State of that name in 1811-'12, and on the question of\r\nthe annexation of Texas in 1843-'45, have been referred to in another\r\nplace. Among the resolutions of the Massachusetts Legislature, in\r\nrelation to the proposed annexation of Texas, adopted in February, 1845,\r\nwere the following:\r\n\r\n    \"2. _Resolved_, That there has hitherto been no precedent of the\r\n    admission of a foreign state or foreign territory into the Union\r\n    by legislation. And as the powers of legislation, granted in the\r\n    Constitution of the United States to Congress, do not embrace a\r\n    case of the admission of a foreign state or foreign territory,\r\n    by legislation, into the Union, such an act of admission _would\r\n    have no binding force whatever on the people of Massachusetts_.\r\n\r\n    \"3. _Resolved_, That the power, _never having been granted by\r\n    the people of Massachusetts_, to admit into the Union States and\r\n    Territories not within the same when the Constitution was\r\n    adopted, _remains with the people, and can only be exercised in\r\n    such way and manner as the people shall hereafter designate and\r\n    appoint_.\"[107]\r\n\r\nTo these stanch declarations of principles--with regard to which\r\n(leaving out of consideration the particular occasion that called them\r\nforth) my only doubt would be whether they do not express too decided a\r\ndoctrine of nullification--may be added the avowal of one of the most\r\ndistinguished sons of Massachusetts, John Quincy Adams, in his discourse\r\nbefore the New York Historical Society, in 1839:\r\n\r\n    \"Nations\" (says Mr. Adams) \"acknowledge no judge between them\r\n    upon earth; and their governments, from necessity, must, in\r\n    their intercourse with each other, decide when the failure of\r\n    one party to a contract to perform its obligations absolves the\r\n    other from the reciprocal fulfillment of its own. But this last\r\n    of earthly powers is not necessary to the freedom or\r\n    independence of States connected together by the immediate\r\n    action of the people of whom they consist. To the people alone\r\n    is there reserved as well the dissolving as the constituent\r\n    power, and that power can be exercised by them only under the\r\n    tie of conscience, binding them to the retributive justice of\r\n    Heaven.\r\n\r\n    \"With these qualifications, we may admit the same right as\r\n    vested in the _people of every State_ in the Union, with\r\n    reference to the General Government, which was exercised by the\r\n    people of the united colonies with reference to the supreme head\r\n    of the British Empire, of which they formed a part; and under\r\n    these limitations have the people of each State in the Union a\r\n    right to secede from the confederated Union itself.\r\n\r\n    \"Thus stands the RIGHT. But the indissoluble link of union\r\n    between the people of the several States of this confederated\r\n    nation is, after all, not in the RIGHT, but in the HEART. If the\r\n    day should ever come (may Heaven avert it!) when the affections\r\n    of the people of these States shall be alienated from each\r\n    other, when the fraternal spirit shall give way to cold\r\n    indifference, or collision of interests shall fester into\r\n    hatred, the bonds of political association will not long hold\r\n    together parties no longer attracted by the magnetism of\r\n    conciliated interests and kindly sympathies; and _far better\r\n    will it be for the people of the disunited States to part in\r\n    friendship with each other than to be held together by\r\n    constraint_. Then will be the time for reverting to the\r\n    precedents which occurred at the formation and adoption of the\r\n    Constitution, to form again a _more perfect Union, by dissolving\r\n    that which could no longer bind_, and to leave the separated\r\n    parts to be reunited by the law of political gravitation to the\r\n    center.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is unfortunate that, in earlier and better times, when the\r\nprospect of serious difficulties first arose, a convention of the States\r\nwas not assembled to consider the relations of the various States and\r\nthe Government of the Union. As time rolled on, the General Government,\r\ngathering with both hands a mass of undelegated powers, reached that\r\nposition which Mr. Jefferson had pointed out as an intolerable evil--the\r\nclaim of a right to judge of the extent of its own authority. Of those\r\nthen participating in public affairs, it was apparently useless to ask\r\nthat the question should be submitted for decision to the parties to the\r\ncompact, under the same conditions as those which controlled the\r\nformation and adoption of the Constitution; otherwise, a convention\r\nwould have been utterly fruitless, for at that period, when aggression\r\nfor sectional aggrandizement had made such rapid advances, it can\r\nscarcely be doubted that more than a fourth, if not a majority of\r\nStates, would have adhered to that policy which had been manifested for\r\nyears in the legislation of many States, as well as in that of the\r\nFederal Government. What course would then have remained to the Southern\r\nStates? Nothing, except either to submit to a continuation of what they\r\nbelieved and felt to be violations of the compact of union, breaches of\r\nfaith, injurious and oppressive usurpation, or else to assert the\r\nsovereign right to reassume the grants they had made, since those grants\r\nhad been perverted from their original and proper purposes.\r\n\r\nSurely the right to resume the powers delegated and to judge of the\r\npropriety and sufficiency of the causes for doing so are alike\r\ninseparable from the possession of sovereignty. Over sovereigns there is\r\nno common judge, and between them can be no umpire, except by their own\r\nagreement and consent. The necessity or propriety of exercising the\r\nright to withdraw from a confederacy or union must be determined by each\r\nmember for itself. Once determined in favor of withdrawal, all that\r\nremains for consideration is the obligation to see that no wanton damage\r\nis done to former associates, and to make such fair settlement of common\r\ninterests as the equity of the case may require.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: \"Madison Papers,\" p. 1006.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: Ibid., pp. 1057, 1058.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: \"Congressional Globe,\" vol. xiv, p. 299.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n    A Bond of Union necessary after the Declaration of\r\n    Independence.--Articles of Confederation.--The Constitution of\r\n    the United States.--The Same Principle for obtaining Grants of\r\n    Power in both.--The Constitution an Instrument enumerating the\r\n    Powers delegated.--The Power of Amendment merely a Power to\r\n    amend the Delegated Grants.--A Smaller Power was required for\r\n    Amendment than for a Grant.--The Power of Amendment is confined\r\n    to Grants of the Constitution.--Limitations on the Power of\r\n    Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn July, 1776, the Congress of the thirteen united colonies declared\r\nthat \"these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and\r\nindependent States.\" The denial of this asserted right and the attempted\r\ncoercion made it manifest that a bond of union was necessary, for the\r\ncommon defense.\r\n\r\nIn November of the next year, viz., 1777, articles of confederation and\r\nperpetual union were entered into by the thirteen States under the style\r\nof \"The United States of America.\" The government instituted was to be\r\nadministered by a congress of delegates from the several States, and\r\neach State to have an equal voice in legislation. The Government so\r\nformed was to act through and by the States, and, having no power to\r\nenforce its requisitions upon the States, embarrassment was early\r\nrealized in its efforts to provide for the exigencies of war. After the\r\ntreaty of peace and recognition of the independence of the States, the\r\ndifficulty of raising revenue and regulating commerce was so great as to\r\nlead to repeated efforts to obtain from the States additional grants of\r\npower. Under the Articles of Confederation no amendment of them could be\r\nmade except by the unanimous consent of the States, and this it had not\r\nbeen found possible to obtain for the powers requisite to the efficient\r\ndischarge of the functions intrusted to the Congress. Hence arose the\r\nproceedings for a convention to amend the articles of confederation. The\r\nresult was the formation of a new plan of government, entitled \"The\r\nConstitution of the United States of America.\"\r\n\r\nThis was submitted to the Congress, in order that, if approved by them,\r\nit might be referred to the States for adoption or rejection by the\r\nseveral conventions thereof, and, if adopted by nine of the States, it\r\nwas to be the compact of union between the States so ratifying the same.\r\n\r\nThe new form of government differed in many essential particulars from\r\nthe old one. The delegates, intent on the purpose to give greater\r\nefficiency to the government of the Union, proposed greatly to enlarge\r\nits powers, so much so that it was not deemed safe to confide them to a\r\nsingle body, and they were consequently distributed between three\r\nindependent departments of government, which might be a check upon one\r\nanother. The Constitution did not, like the Articles of Confederation,\r\ndeclare that the States had agreed to a perpetual union, but distinctly\r\nindicated the hope of its perpetuity by the expression in the preamble\r\nof the purpose to \"secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our\r\nposterity.\" The circumstances under which the Union of the Constitution\r\nwas formed justified the hope of its perpetuity, but the brief existence\r\nof the Confederation may have been a warning against the renewal of the\r\nassertion that the compact should be perpetual.\r\n\r\nA remedy for the embarrassment which had been realized, under the\r\nArticles of Confederation, in obtaining amendments to correct any\r\ndefects in grants of power, so as to render them effective for the\r\npurpose for which they were given, was provided by its fifth article. It\r\nis here to be specially noted that new grants of power, as asked for by\r\nthe Convention, were under the Articles of Confederation only to be\r\nobtained from the unanimous assent of the States. Therefore it followed\r\nthat two of the States which did not ratify the Constitution were, so\r\nlong as they retained that attitude, free from its obligations. Thus it\r\nis seen that the same principle in regard to obtaining grants of\r\nadditional power for the Federal Government formed the rule for the\r\nUnion as it had done for the Confederation; that is, that the consent of\r\neach and every State was a prerequisite. The apprehension which justly\r\nexisted that several of the States might reject the Constitution, and\r\nunder the rule of unanimity defeat it, led to the seventh article of the\r\nConstitution, which, provided that the ratification by the conventions\r\nof nine States should be sufficient for the establishment of the\r\nConstitution between the States ratifying it, which of course\r\ncontemplated leaving the others, more or less in number, separate and\r\ndistinct from the nine States forming a new government. Thus was the\r\nUnion to be a voluntary compact, and all the powers of its government to\r\nbe derived from the assent of each of its members.\r\n\r\nThese powers as proposed by the Constitution were so extensive as to\r\ncreate alarm and opposition by some of the most influential men in many\r\nof the States. It is known that the objection of the patriot Samuel\r\nAdams was only overcome by an assurance that such an amendment as the\r\ntenth would be adopted. Like opposition was by like assurance elsewhere\r\novercome. That article is in these words: \"The powers not delegated to\r\nthe United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the\r\nStates, are reserved to the States respectively or to the people.\"\r\n\r\nAmendment, however, of the delegated powers was made more easy than it\r\nhad been under the Confederation. Ratification by three fourths of the\r\nStates was sufficient under the Constitution for the adoption of an\r\namendment to it. As this power of amendment threatens to be the Aaron's\r\nrod which will swallow up the rest, I propose to give it special\r\nexamination. What is the Constitution of the United States? The whole\r\nbody of the instrument, the history of its formation and adoption, as\r\nwell as the tenth amendment, added in an abundance of caution, clearly\r\nshow it to be an instrument enumerating the powers delegated by the\r\nStates to the Federal Government, their common agent. It is specifically\r\ndeclared that all which was not so delegated was reserved. On this mass\r\nof reserved powers, those which the States declined to grant, the\r\nFederal Government was expressly forbidden to intrude. Of what value\r\nwould this prohibition have been, if three fourths of the States could,\r\nwithout the assent of a particular State, invade the domain which that\r\nState had reserved for its own exclusive use and control?\r\n\r\nIt has heretofore, I hope, been satisfactorily demonstrated that the\r\nStates were sovereigns before they formed the Union, and that they have\r\nnever surrendered their sovereignty, but have only intrusted by their\r\ncommon agent certain functions of sovereignty to be used for their\r\ncommon welfare.\r\n\r\nAmong the powers delegated was one to amend the Constitution, which, it\r\nis submitted, was merely the power to amend the delegated grants, and\r\nthese were obtained by the separate and independent action of each State\r\nacceding to the Union. When we consider how carefully each clause was\r\ndiscussed in the General Convention, and how closely each was\r\nscrutinized in the conventions of the several States, the conclusion can\r\nnot be avoided that all was specified which it was intended to bestow,\r\nand not a few of the wisest in that day held that too much power had\r\nbeen conferred.\r\n\r\nAware of the imperfection of everything devised by man, it was foreseen\r\nthat, in the exercise of the functions intrusted to the General\r\nGovernment, experience might reveal the necessity of modification--i.e.,\r\namendment--and power was therefore given to amend, in a certain manner,\r\nthe delegated trusts so as to make them efficient for the purposes\r\ndesigned, or to prevent their misconstruction or abuse to the injury or\r\noppression of any of the people. In support of this view I refer to the\r\nhistorical fact that the first ten amendments of the Constitution,\r\nnearly coeval with it, all refer either to the powers delegated, or are\r\ndirected to the greater security of the rights which were guarded by\r\nexpress limitations.\r\n\r\nThe distinction in the mind of the framers of the Constitution between\r\namendment and delegation of power seems to me clearly drawn by the fact\r\nthat the Constitution itself, which was a proposition to the States to\r\ngrant enumerated powers, was only to have effect between the ratifying\r\nStates; but the fifth article provided that amendments to the\r\nConstitution might be adopted by three fourths of the States, and\r\nthereby be valid as part of the Constitution. It thus appears that a\r\nsmaller power was required for an amendment than for a grant, and the\r\nnatural if not necessary conclusion is, that it was because an amendment\r\nmust belong to, and grow out of, a grant previously made. If a so-called\r\namendment could have been the means of obtaining a new power, is it to\r\nbe supposed that those watchful guardians of community independence, for\r\nwhich the war of the Revolution had been fought, would have been\r\nreconciled to the adoption of the Constitution, by the declaration that\r\nthe powers not delegated are reserved to the States? Unless the power of\r\namendment be confined to the grants of the Constitution, there can be no\r\nsecurity to the reserved rights of a minority less than a fourth of the\r\nStates. I submit that the word \"amendment\" necessarily implies an\r\nimprovement upon something which is possessed, and can have no proper\r\napplication to that which did not previously exist.\r\n\r\nThe apprehension that was felt of this power of amendment by the framers\r\nof the Constitution is shown by the restrictions placed upon the\r\nexercise of several of the delegated powers. For example: power was\r\ngiven to admit new States, but no new State should be erected within the\r\njurisdiction of any other State, nor be formed by the junction of two or\r\nmore States, or parts of States, without the consent of the Legislatures\r\nof those States; and the power to regulate commerce was limited by the\r\nprohibition of an amendment affecting, for a certain time, the migration\r\nor importation of persons whom any of the existing States should think\r\nproper to admit; and by the very important provision for the protection\r\nof the smaller States and the preservation of their equality in the\r\nUnion, that the compact in regard to the membership of the two Houses of\r\nCongress should not be so amended that any \"State, without its consent,\r\nshall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate.\" These\r\nlimitations and prohibitions on the power of amendment all refer to\r\nclauses of the Constitution, to things which existed as part of the\r\nGeneral Government; they were not needed, and therefore not to be found\r\nin relation to the reserved powers of the States, on which the General\r\nGovernment was forbidden to intrude by the ninth article of the\r\namendments.\r\n\r\nIn view of the small territory of the New England States, comparatively\r\nto that of the Middle and Southern States, and the probability of the\r\ncreation of new States in the large Territory of some of these latter,\r\nit might well have been anticipated that in the course of time the New\r\nEngland States would become less than one fourth of the members of the\r\nUnion. Nothing is less likely than that the watchful patriots of that\r\nregion would have consented to a form of government which should give to\r\na majority of three fourths of the States the power to deprive them of\r\ntheir dearest rights and privileges. Yet to this extremity the new-born\r\ntheory of the power of amendment would go. Against this insidious\r\nassault, this wooden horse which it is threatened to introduce into the\r\ncitadel of our liberties, I have sought to warn the inheritors of our\r\nfree institutions, and earnestly do invoke the resistance of all true\r\npatriots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nSECESSION AND CONFEDERATION.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n    Opening of the New Year.--The People in Advance of their\r\n    Representatives.--Conciliatory Conduct of Southern Members of\r\n    Congress.--Sensational Fictions.--Misstatements of the Count of\r\n    Paris.--Obligations of a Senator.--The Southern Forts and\r\n    Arsenals.--Pensacola Bay and Fort Pickens.--The Alleged \"Caucus\"\r\n    and its Resolutions.--Personal Motives and Feelings.--The\r\n    Presidency not a Desirable Office.--Letter from the Hon. C. C.\r\n    Clay.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the failure of the Senate Committee of Thirteen to come to any\r\nagreement, the last reasonable hope of a pacific settlement of\r\ndifficulties within the Union was extinguished in the minds of those\r\nmost reluctant to abandon the effort. The year 1861 opened, as we have\r\nseen, upon the spectacle of a general belief, among the people of the\r\nplanting States, in the necessity of an early secession, as the only\r\npossible alternative left them.\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that the calmness and deliberation, with which\r\nthe measures requisite for withdrawal were adopted and executed, afford\r\nthe best refutation of the charge that they were the result of haste,\r\npassion, or precipitation. Still more contrary to truth is the\r\nassertion, so often recklessly made and reiterated, that the people of\r\nthe South were led into secession, against their will and their better\r\njudgment, by a few ambitious and discontented politicians.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that the Southern people were in advance of their\r\nrepresentatives throughout, and that these latter were not agitators or\r\nleaders in the popular movement. They were in harmony with its great\r\nprinciples, but their influence, with very few exceptions, was exerted\r\nto restrain rather than to accelerate their application, and to allay\r\nrather than to stimulate excitement. As sentinels on the outer wall, the\r\npeople had a right to look to them for warning of approaching danger;\r\nbut, as we have seen, in that last session of the last Congress that\r\npreceded the disruption, Southern Senators, of the class generally\r\nconsidered extremists, served on a committee of pacification, and strove\r\nearnestly to promote its objects. Failing in this, they still exerted\r\nthemselves to prevent the commission of any act that might result in\r\nbloodshed.\r\n\r\nInvention has busied itself, to the exhaustion of its resources, in the\r\ncreation of imaginary \"cabals,\" \"conspiracies,\" and \"intrigues,\" among\r\nthe Senators and Representatives of the South on duty in Washington at\r\nthat time. The idle gossip of the public hotels, the sensational rumors\r\nof the streets, the _canards_ of newspaper correspondents--whatever was\r\nfloating through the atmosphere of that anxious period--however lightly\r\nregarded at the moment by the more intelligent, has since been drawn\r\nupon for materials to be used in the construction of what has been\r\nwidely accepted as authentic history. Nothing would seem to be too\r\nabsurd for such uses. Thus, it has been gravely stated that a caucus of\r\nSouthern Senators, held in the early part of January, \"resolved to\r\nassume to themselves the political power of the South\"; that they took\r\nentire control of all political and military operations; that they\r\nissued instructions for the passage of ordinances of secession, and for\r\nthe seizure of forts, arsenals, and custom-houses; with much more of the\r\nlike groundless fiction. A foreign prince, who served for a time in the\r\nFederal Army, and has since undertaken to write a history of \"The Civil\r\nWar in America\"--a history the incomparable blunders of which are\r\nredeemed from suspicion of willful misstatement only by the writer's\r\nignorance of the subject--speaks of the Southern representatives as\r\nhaving \"kept their seats in Congress in order to be able to paralyze its\r\naction, forming, at the same time, a center whence they issued\r\ndirections to their friends in the South to complete the dismemberment\r\nof the republic.\"[108] And again, with reference to the secession of\r\nseveral States, he says that \"the word of command issued by _the\r\ncommittee at Washington was_ promptly obeyed.\"[109]\r\n\r\nStatements such as these are a travesty upon history. That the\r\nrepresentatives of the South held conference with one another and took\r\ncounsel together, as men having common interests and threatened by\r\ncommon dangers, is true, and is the full extent of the truth. That they\r\ncommunicated to friends at home information of what was passing is to be\r\npresumed, and would have been most obligatory if it had not been that\r\nthe published proceedings rendered such communication needless. But that\r\nany such man, or committee of men, should have undertaken to direct the\r\nmighty movement then progressing throughout the South, or to control,\r\nthrough the telegraph and the mails, the will and the judgment of\r\nconventions of the people, assembled under the full consciousness of the\r\ndignity of that sovereignty which they represented, would have been an\r\nextraordinary degree of folly and presumption.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity of the statement is further evident from a consideration\r\nof the fact that the movements which culminated in the secession of the\r\nseveral States began before the meeting of Congress. They were not\r\ninaugurated, prosecuted, or controlled by the Senators and\r\nRepresentatives in Congress, but by the Governors, Legislatures, and\r\nfinally by the delegates of the people in conventions of the respective\r\nStates. I believe I may fairly claim to have possessed a full share of\r\nthe confidence of the people of the State which I in part represented;\r\nand proof has already been furnished to show how little effect my own\r\ninfluence could have upon their action, even in the negative capacity of\r\na brake upon the wheels, by means of which it was hurried on to\r\nconsummation.\r\n\r\nAs for the imputation of holding our seats as a vantage-ground in\r\nplotting for the dismemberment of the Union--in connection with which\r\nthe Count of Paris does me the honor to single out my name for special\r\nmention--it is a charge so dishonorable, if true, to its object--so\r\ndisgraceful, if false, to its author--as to be outside of the proper\r\nlimit of discussion. It is a charge which no accuser ever made in my\r\npresence, though I had in public debate more than once challenged its\r\nassertion and denounced its falsehood. It is enough to say that I always\r\nheld, and repeatedly avowed, the principle that a Senator in Congress\r\noccupied the position of an ambassador from the State which he\r\nrepresented to the Government of the United States, as well as in some\r\nsense a member of the Government; and that, in either capacity, it would\r\nbe dishonorable to use his powers and privileges for the destruction or\r\nfor the detriment of the Government to which he was accredited. Acting\r\non this principle, as long as I held a seat in the Senate, my best\r\nefforts were directed to the maintenance of the Constitution, the Union\r\nresulting from it, and to make the General Government an effective agent\r\nof the States for its prescribed purpose. As soon as the paramount\r\nallegiance due to Mississippi forbade a continuance of these efforts, I\r\nwithdrew from the position. To say that during this period I did nothing\r\nsecretly, in conflict with what was done or professed openly, would be\r\nmerely to assert my own integrity, which would be worthless to those who\r\nmay doubt it, and superfluous to those who believe in it. What has been\r\nsaid on the subject for myself, I believe to be also true of my Southern\r\nassociates in Congress.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the forts, arsenals, etc., something more remains to be\r\nsaid. The authorities of the Southern States immediately after, and in\r\nsome cases a few days before, their actual secession, took possession\r\n(in every instance without resistance or bloodshed) of forts, arsenals,\r\ncustom-houses, and other public property within their respective limits.\r\nI do not propose at this time to consider the question of their right to\r\ndo so; that may be more properly done hereafter. But it may not be out\r\nof place briefly to refer to the statement, often made, that the absence\r\nof troops from the military posts in the South, which enabled the States\r\nso quietly to take such possession, was the result of collusion and\r\nprearrangement between the Southern leaders and the Federal Secretary of\r\nWar, John B. Floyd, of Virginia. It is a sufficient answer to this\r\nallegation to state the fact that the absence of troops from these\r\nposts, instead of being exceptional, was, and still is, their ordinary\r\ncondition in time of peace. At the very moment when these sentences are\r\nbeing written (in 1880), although the army of the United States is twice\r\nas large as in 1860; although four years of internal war and a yet\r\nlonger period of subsequent military occupation of the South have\r\nhabituated the public to the presence of troops in their midst, to an\r\nextent that would formerly have been startling if not offensive;\r\nalthough allegations of continued disaffection on the part of the\r\nSouthern people have been persistently reiterated, for party\r\npurposes--yet it is believed that the forts and arsenals in the States\r\nof the Gulf are in as defenseless a condition, and as liable to quiet\r\nseizure (if any such purpose existed), as in the beginning of the year\r\n1861. Certainly, those within the range of my personal information are\r\noccupied, as they were at that time, only by ordnance-sergeants or\r\nfort-keepers.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, some exceptions to this general rule--especially in\r\nthe defensive works of the harbor of Charleston, the forts at Key West\r\nand the Dry Tortugas, and those protecting the entrance of Pensacola\r\nBay. The events which occurred in Charleston Harbor will be more\r\nconveniently noticed hereafter. The island forts near the extreme\r\nsouthern point of Florida were too isolated and too remote from\r\npopulation to be disturbed at that time; but the situation long\r\nmaintained at the mouth of Pensacola Bay affords a signal illustration\r\nof the forbearance and conciliatory spirit that animated Southern\r\ncounsels. For a long time, Fort Pickens, on the island of Santa Rosa, at\r\nthe entrance to the harbor, was occupied only by a small body of Federal\r\nsoldiers and marines--less than one hundred, all told. Immediately\r\nopposite, and in possession of the other two forts and the adjacent\r\nnavy-yard, was a strong force of volunteer troops of Florida and Alabama\r\n(which might, on short notice, have been largely increased), ready and\r\nanxious to attack and take possession of Fort Pickens. That they could\r\nhave done so is unquestionable, and, if mere considerations of military\r\nadvantage had been consulted, it would surely have been done. But the\r\nlove of peace and the purpose to preserve it, together with a revulsion\r\nfrom the thought of engaging in fraternal strife, were more potent than\r\nconsiderations of probable interest. During the anxious period of\r\nuncertainty and apprehension which ensued, the efforts of the Southern\r\nSenators in Washington were employed to dissuade (they could not\r\n_command_) from any aggressive movement, however justifiable, that might\r\nlead to collision. These efforts were exerted through written and\r\ntelegraphic communications to the Governors of Alabama and Florida, the\r\nCommander of the Southern troops, and other influential persons near the\r\nscene of operations. The records of the telegraph-office, if preserved,\r\nwill no doubt show this to be a very moderate statement of those\r\nefforts. It is believed that by such influence alone a collision was\r\naverted; and it is certain that its exercise gave great dissatisfaction\r\nat the time to some of the ardent advocates of more active measures. It\r\nmay be that _they_ were right, and that we, who counseled delay and\r\nforbearance, were wrong. Certainly, if we could have foreseen the\r\nultimate failure of all efforts for a peaceful settlement, and the\r\nperfidy that was afterward to be practiced in connection with them, our\r\nadvice would have been different.\r\n\r\nCertain resolutions, said to have been adopted in a meeting of Senators\r\nheld on the evening of the 5th of January,[110] have been magnified, by\r\nthe representations of artful commentators on the events of the period,\r\ninto something vastly momentous.\r\n\r\nThe significance of these resolutions was the admission that we could\r\nnot longer advise delay, and even that was unimportant under the\r\ncircumstances, for three of the States concerned had taken final action\r\non the subject before the resolutions could have been communicated to\r\nthem. As an expression of opinion, they merely stated that of which we\r\nhad all become convinced by the experience of the previous month--that\r\nour long-cherished hopes had proved illusory--that further efforts in\r\nCongress would be unavailing, and that nothing remained, except that the\r\nStates should take the matter into their own hands, as final judges of\r\ntheir wrongs and of the measure of redress. They recommended the\r\nformation of a confederacy among the seceding States as early as\r\npossible after their secession--advice the expediency of which could\r\nhardly be questioned, either by friend or foe. As to the \"instructions\"\r\nasked for with regard to the propriety of continuing to hold their\r\nseats, I suppose it must have been caused by some diversity of opinion\r\nwhich then and long afterward continued to exist; and the practical\r\nvalue of which must have been confined to Senators of States which did\r\nnot actually secede. For myself, I can only say that no advice could\r\nhave prevailed on me to hold a seat in the Senate after receiving notice\r\nthat Mississippi had withdrawn from the Union. The best evidence that my\r\nassociates thought likewise is the fact that, although no instructions\r\nwere given them, they promptly withdrew on the receipt of official\r\ninformation of the withdrawal of the States which they represented.\r\n\r\nIt will not be amiss here briefly to state what were my position and\r\nfeelings at the period now under consideration, as they have been the\r\nsubject of gross and widespread misrepresentation. It is not only\r\nuntrue, but absurd, to attribute to me motives of personal ambition to\r\nbe gratified by a dismemberment of the Union. Much of my life had been\r\nspent in the military and civil service of the United States. Whatever\r\nreputation I had acquired was identified with their history; and, if\r\nfuture preferment had been the object, it would have led me to cling to\r\nthe Union as long as a shred of it should remain. If any, judging after\r\nthe event, should assume that I was allured by the high office\r\nsubsequently conferred upon me by the people of the Confederate States,\r\nthe answer to any such conclusion has been made by others, to whom it\r\nwas well known, before the Confederacy was formed, that I had no desire\r\nto be its President. When the suggestion was made to me, I expressed a\r\ndecided objection, and gave reasons of a public and permanent character\r\nagainst being placed in that position.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I then held the office of United States Senator from\r\nMississippi--one which I preferred to all others. The kindness of the\r\npeople had three times conferred it upon me, and I had no reason to fear\r\nthat it would not be given again, as often as desired. So far from\r\nwishing to change this position for any other, I had specially requested\r\nmy friends (some of whom had thought of putting me in nomination for the\r\nPresidency of the United States in 1860) not to permit \"my name to be\r\nused before the Convention for any nomination whatever.\"\r\n\r\nI had been so near the office for four years, while in the Cabinet of\r\nMr. Pierce, that I saw it from behind the scenes, and it was to me an\r\noffice in no wise desirable. The responsibilities were great; the labor,\r\nthe vexations, the disappointments, were greater. Those who have\r\nintimately known the official and personal life of our Presidents can\r\nnot fail to remember how few have left the office as happy men as when\r\nthey entered it, how darkly the shadows gathered around the setting sun,\r\nand how eagerly the multitude would turn to gaze upon another orb just\r\nrising to take its place in the political firmament.\r\n\r\nWorn by incessant fatigue, broken in fortune, debarred by public\r\nopinion, prejudice, or tradition, from future employment, the wisest and\r\nbest who have filled that office have retired to private life, to\r\nremember rather the failure of their hopes than the success of their\r\nefforts. He must, indeed, be a self-confident man who could hope to fill\r\nthe chair of Washington with satisfaction to himself, with the assurance\r\nof receiving on his retirement the meed awarded by the people to that\r\ngreat man, that he had \"lived enough for life and for glory,\" or even of\r\nfeeling that the sacrifice of self had been compensated by the service\r\nrendered to his country.\r\n\r\nThe following facts were presented in a letter written several years ago\r\nby the Hon. C. C. Clay, of Alabama, who was one of my most intimate\r\nassociates in the Senate, with reference to certain misstatements to\r\nwhich his attention had been called by one of my friends:\r\n\r\n    \"The import is, that Mr. Davis, disappointed and chagrined at\r\n    not receiving the nomination of the Democratic party for\r\n    President of the United States in 1860, took the lead on the\r\n    assembling of Congress in December, 1860, in a 'conspiracy' of\r\n    Southern Senators 'which planned the secession of the Southern\r\n    States from the Union,' and 'on the night of January 5, 1861,...\r\n    framed the scheme of revolution which was implicitly and\r\n    promptly followed at the South.' In other words, that Southern\r\n    Senators (and, chief among them, Jefferson Davis), then and\r\n    there, instigated and induced the Southern States to secede.\r\n\r\n    \"I am quite sure that Mr. Davis neither expected nor desired the\r\n    nomination for the Presidency of the United States in 1860. He\r\n    never evinced any such aspiration, by word or sign, to me--with\r\n    whom he was, I believe, as intimate and confidential as with any\r\n    person outside of his own family. On the contrary, he requested\r\n    the delegation from Mississippi not to permit the use of his\r\n    name before the Convention. And, after the nomination of both\r\n    Douglas and Breckinridge, he conferred with them, at the\r\n    instance of leading Democrats, to persuade them to withdraw,\r\n    that their friends might unite on some second choice--an office\r\n    he would never have undertaken, had he sought the nomination or\r\n    believed he was regarded as an aspirant.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Davis did not take an active part in planning or hastening\r\n    secession. I think he only _regretfully_ consented to it, as a\r\n    political necessity for the preservation of popular and State\r\n    rights, which were seriously threatened by the triumph of a\r\n    sectional party who were pledged to make war on them. I know\r\n    that some leading men, and even Mississippians, thought him too\r\n    moderate and backward, and found fault with him for not taking a\r\n    leading part in secession.\r\n\r\n    \"No 'plan of secession' or 'scheme of revolution' was, to my\r\n    knowledge, discussed--certainly none matured--at the caucus, 5th\r\n    of January, 1861, unless, forsooth, the resolutions appended\r\n    hereto be so held. They comprise the sum and substance of what\r\n    was said and done. I never heard that the caucus advised the\r\n    South 'to accumulate munitions of war,' or 'to organize and\r\n    equip an army of one hundred thousand men,' or determined 'to\r\n    hold on as long as possible to the Southern seats.' So far from\r\n    it, a majority of Southern Senators seemed to think there would\r\n    be no war; that the dominant party in the North desired\r\n    separation from the South, and would gladly let their 'erring\r\n    sisters go in peace.' I could multiply proofs of such a\r\n    disposition. As to holding on to their seats, no Southern\r\n    Legislature advised it, no Southern Senator who favored\r\n    secession did so but one, and none others wished to do so, I\r\n    believe.\r\n\r\n    \"The 'plan of secession,' if any, and the purpose of secession,\r\n    unquestionably, originated, not in Washington City, or with the\r\n    Senators or Representatives of the South, but among the people\r\n    of the several States, many months before it was attempted. They\r\n    followed no leaders at Washington or elsewhere, but acted for\r\n    themselves, with an independence and unanimity unprecedented in\r\n    any movement of such magnitude. Before the meeting of the caucus\r\n    of January 5, 1861, South Carolina had seceded, and Alabama,\r\n    Mississippi, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas had taken the initial\r\n    step of secession, by calling conventions for its\r\n    accomplishment. Before the election of Lincoln, all the Southern\r\n    States, excepting one or two, had pledged themselves to separate\r\n    from the Union upon the triumph of a sectional party in the\r\n    Presidential election, by acts or resolutions of their\r\n    Legislatures, resolves of both Democratic and Whig State\r\n    Conventions, and of primary assemblies of the people--in every\r\n    way in which they could commit themselves to any future act.\r\n    Their purpose was proclaimed to the world through the press and\r\n    telegraph, and criticised in Congress, in the Northern\r\n    Legislatures, in press and pulpit, and on the hustings, during\r\n    many months before Congress met in December, 1860.\r\n\r\n    \"Over and above all these facts, the reports of the United\r\n    States Senate show that, prior to the 5th of January, 1861,\r\n    Southern Senators united with Northern Democratic Senators in an\r\n    effort to effect pacification and prevent secession, and that\r\n    Jefferson Davis was one of a committee appointed by the Senate\r\n    to consider and report such a measure; that it failed because\r\n    the Northern Republicans opposed everything that looked to\r\n    peace; that Senator Douglas arraigned them as trying to\r\n    precipitate secession, referred to Jefferson Davis as one who\r\n    sought conciliation, and called upon the Republican Senators to\r\n    tell what they would do, if anything, to restore harmony and\r\n    prevent disunion. They did not even deign a response. Thus, by\r\n    their sullen silence, they made confession (without avoidance)\r\n    of their stubborn purpose to hold up no hand raised to maintain\r\n    the Union....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: \"History of the Civil war,\" by the Count of Paris;\r\nAmerican translation, vol. i, p. 122.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: Ibid, p. 125.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: Subjoined are the resolutions referred to, adopted by the\r\nSenators from Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas,\r\nand Arkansas.

The ultimate ownership of the soil, or eminent\r\ndomain, remains with the people of the State in which it lies, by virtue\r\nof their sovereignty. Thus, the State of Massachusetts has declared\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n    \"The sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Commonwealth extend to\r\n    all places within the boundaries thereof, subject only to such\r\n    rights of _concurrent jurisdiction_ as have been or may be\r\n    granted over any places ceded by the Commonwealth to the United\r\n    States.\"[111]\r\n\r\nIn the acts of cession of the respective States, the terms and\r\nconditions on which the grant is made are expressed in various forms and\r\nwith differing degrees of precision. The act of New York, granting the\r\nuse of a site for the Brooklyn Navy-Yard, may serve as a specimen. It\r\ncontains this express condition:\r\n\r\n    \"The United States are to retain such use and jurisdiction, _so\r\n    long as said tract shall be applied to the defense and safety of\r\n    the city and port of New York, and no longer_.... But the\r\n    jurisdiction hereby ceded, and the exemption from taxation\r\n    herein granted, shall continue in respect to said property, and\r\n    to each portion thereof, _so long as the same shall remain the\r\n    property of the United States_, and be used for the purposes\r\n    aforesaid, _and no longer_.\" The cession of the site of the\r\n    Watervliet Arsenal is made in the same or equivalent terms,\r\n    except that, instead of \"defense and safety of the city and port\r\n    of New York,\" etc., the language is, \"defense and safety _of the\r\n    said State_, and no longer.\"\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina in 1805, by legislative enactment, ceded to the United\r\nStates, in Charleston Harbor and on Beaufort River, various forts and\r\nfortifications, and sites for the erection of forts, on the following\r\nconditions, viz.:\r\n\r\n    \"That, if the United States shall not, within three years from\r\n    the passing of this act, and notification thereof by the\r\n    Governor of this State to the Executive of the United States,\r\n    repair the fortifications now existing thereon or build such\r\n    other forts or fortifications as may be deemed most expedient by\r\n    the Executive of the United States on the same, and keep a\r\n    garrison or garrisons therein; in such case this grant or\r\n    cession shall be void and of no effect.\"--(\"Statutes at Large of\r\n    South Carolina,\" vol. v, p. 501.)\r\n\r\nIt will hardly be contended that the conditions of this grant were\r\nfulfilled, and, if it be answered that the State did not demand the\r\nrestoration of the forts or sites, the answer certainly fails after\r\n1860, when the controversy arose, and the unfounded assertion was made\r\nthat those forts and sites had been purchased with the money, and were\r\ntherefore the property, of the United States. The terms of the cession\r\nsufficiently manifest that they were free-will offerings of such forts\r\nand sites as belonged to the State; and public functionaries were bound\r\nto know that, by the United States law of March 20, 1794, it was\r\nprovided \"that no purchase shall be made where such lands are the\r\nproperty of a State.\"--(Act to provide for the defense of certain ports\r\nand harbors of the United States.)\r\n\r\nThe stipulations made by Virginia, in ceding the ground for Fortress\r\nMonroe and the Rip Raps, on the 1st of March, 1821, are as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"_An Act ceding to the United States the lands on Old Point\r\n    Comfort, and the shoal called the Rip Raps._\r\n\r\n    \"_Whereas_, It is shown to the present General Assembly that the\r\n    Government of the United States is solicitous that certain lands\r\n    at Old Point Comfort, and at the shoal called the Rip Raps,\r\n    should be, with the right of property and entire jurisdiction\r\n    thereon, vested in the said United States for the purpose of\r\n    fortification and other objects of national defense:\r\n\r\n    \"1. _Be it enacted by the General Assembly_, That it shall be\r\n    lawful and proper for the Governor of this Commonwealth, by\r\n    conveyance or deeds in writing under his hand and the seal of\r\n    the State, to transfer, assign, and make over unto the said\r\n    United States the right of property and title, as well as all\r\n    the jurisdiction which this Commonwealth possesses over the\r\n    lands and shoal at Old Point Comfort and the Rip Raps:...\r\n\r\n    \"2. _And be it further enacted_, That, _should the said United\r\n    States at any time abandon the said lands and shoal, or\r\n    appropriate them to any other purposes than those indicated in\r\n    the preamble to this act, that then, and in that case, the same\r\n    shall revert to and revest in this Commonwealth_.\"[112]\r\n\r\nBy accepting such grants, under such conditions, the Government of the\r\nUnited States assented to their propriety, and the principle that holds\r\ngood in any one case is of course applicable to all others of the same\r\nsort, whether expressly asserted in the act of cession or not. Indeed,\r\nno express declaration would be necessary to establish a conclusion\r\nresulting so directly from the nature of the case, and the settled\r\nprinciples of sovereignty and eminent domain.\r\n\r\nA State withdrawing from the Union would necessarily assume the control\r\ntheretofore exercised by the General Government over all public defenses\r\nand other public property within her limits. It would, however, be but\r\nfair and proper that adequate compensation should be made to the other\r\nmembers of the partnership, or their common agent, for the value of the\r\nworks and for any other advantage obtained by the one party, or loss\r\nincurred by the other. Such equitable settlement, the seceding States of\r\nthe South, without exception, as I believe, were desirous to make, and\r\nprompt to propose to the Federal authorities.\r\n\r\nOn the secession of South Carolina, the condition of the defenses of\r\nCharleston Harbor became a subject of anxiety with all parties. Of the\r\nthree forts in or at the entrance of the harbor, two were unoccupied,\r\nbut the third (Fort Moultrie) was held by a garrison of but little more\r\nthan one hundred men--of whom only sixty-three were said to be\r\neffectives--under command of Major Robert Anderson, of the First\r\nArtillery.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve days before the secession of South Carolina, the\r\nrepresentatives in Congress from that State had called on the President\r\nto assure him, in anticipation of the secession of the State, that no\r\npurpose was entertained by South Carolina to attack, or in any way\r\nmolest, the forts held by the United States in the harbor of\r\nCharleston--at least until opportunity could be had for an amicable\r\nsettlement of all questions that might arise with regard to these forts\r\nand other public property--provided that no reënforcements should be\r\nsent, and the military _status_ should be permitted to remain unchanged.\r\nThe South Carolinians understood Mr. Buchanan as approving of this\r\nsuggestion, although declining to make any formal pledge.\r\n\r\nIt appears, nevertheless, from subsequent developments, that both before\r\nand after the secession of South Carolina preparations were secretly\r\nmade for reënforcing Major Anderson, in case it should be deemed\r\nnecessary by the Government at Washington.[113] On the 11th of December\r\ninstructions were communicated to him, from the War Department, of which\r\nthe following is the essential part:\r\n\r\n    \"You are carefully to avoid every act which would needlessly\r\n    tend to provoke aggression; and for that reason you are not,\r\n    without evident and imminent necessity, to take up any position\r\n    which could be construed into the assumption of a hostile\r\n    attitude, but you are to hold possession of the forts in this\r\n    harbor, and, if attacked, you are to defend yourself to the last\r\n    extremity. The smallness of your force will not permit you,\r\n    perhaps, to occupy more than one of the three forts, but an\r\n    attack on, or attempt to take possession of either of them, will\r\n    be regarded as an act of hostility, and you may then put your\r\n    command into either of them which you may deem most proper to\r\n    increase its power of resistance. You are also authorized to\r\n    take similar defensive steps, whenever you have tangible\r\n    evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act.\"[114]\r\n\r\nThese instructions were afterward modified--as we are informed by Mr.\r\nBuchanan--so as, instead of requiring him to defend himself \"to the last\r\nextremity,\" to direct him to do so as long as any reasonable hope\r\nremained of saving the fort.[115]\r\n\r\nImmediately after the secession of the State, the Convention of South\r\nCarolina deputed three distinguished citizens of that State--Messrs.\r\nRobert W. Barnwell, James H. Adams, and James L. Orr--to proceed to\r\nWashington, \"to treat with the Government of the United States for the\r\ndelivery of the forts, magazines, lighthouses, and other real estate,\r\nwith their appurtenances, within the limits of South Carolina, and also\r\nfor an apportionment of the public debt, and for a division of all other\r\nproperty held by the Government of the United States, as agent of the\r\nconfederated States, of which South Carolina was recently a member; and\r\ngenerally to negotiate as to all other measures and arrangements proper\r\nto be made and adopted in the existing relation of the parties, and for\r\nthe continuance of peace and amity between this Commonwealth and the\r\nGovernment at Washington.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners, in the discharge of the duty intrusted to them,\r\narrived in Washington on the 26th of December. Before they could\r\ncommunicate with the President, however--indeed, on the morning after\r\ntheir arrival--they were startled, and the whole country electrified, by\r\nthe news that, during the previous night, Major Anderson had \"secretly\r\ndismantled Fort Moultrie,\"[116] spiked his guns, burned his\r\ngun-carriages, and removed his command to Fort Sumter, which occupied a\r\nmore commanding position in the harbor. This movement changed the whole\r\naspect of affairs. It was considered by the Government and people of\r\nSouth Carolina as a violation of the implied pledge of a maintenance of\r\nthe _status quo_; the remaining forts and other public property were at\r\nonce taken possession of by the State; and the condition of public\r\nfeeling became greatly exacerbated. An interview between the President\r\nand the Commissioners was followed by a sharp correspondence, which was\r\nterminated on the 1st of January, 1861, by the return to the\r\nCommissioners of their final communication, with an endorsement stating\r\nthat it was of such a character that the President declined to receive\r\nit. The negotiations were thus abruptly broken off. This correspondence\r\nmay be found in the Appendix.[117]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Mr. Cass, Secretary of State, had resigned his\r\nposition early in December, on the ground of the refusal of the\r\nPresident to send reënforcements to Charleston. On the occupation of\r\nFort Sumter by Major Anderson, Mr. Floyd, Secretary of War, taking the\r\nground that it was virtually a violation of a pledge given or implied by\r\nthe Government, had asked that the garrison should be entirely withdrawn\r\nfrom the harbor of Charleston, and, on the refusal of the President to\r\nconsent to this, had tendered his resignation, which was promptly\r\naccepted.[118]\r\n\r\nThis is believed to be a correct outline of the earlier facts with\r\nregard to the Charleston forts, and in giving it I have done so, as far\r\nas possible, without prejudice, or any expression of opinion upon the\r\nmotives of the actors.\r\n\r\nThe kind relations, both personal and political, which had long existed\r\nbetween Mr. Buchanan and myself, had led him, occasionally, during his\r\npresidency, to send for me to confer with him on subjects that caused\r\nhim anxiety, and warranted me in sometimes calling upon him to offer my\r\nopinion on matters of special interest or importance. Thus it was that I\r\nhad communicated with him freely in regard to the threatening aspect of\r\nevents in the earlier part of the winter of 1860-'61. When he told me of\r\nthe work that had been done, or was doing, at Fort Moultrie--that is,\r\nthe elevation of its parapet by crowning it with barrels of sand--I\r\npointed out to him the impolicy as well as inefficiency of the measure.\r\nIt seemed to me impolitic to make ostensible preparations for defense,\r\nwhen no attack was threatened; and the means adopted were inefficient,\r\nbecause any ordinary field-piece would knock the barrels off the\r\nparapet, and thus to render them only hurtful to the defenders. He\r\ninquired whether the expedient had not been successful at Fort Brown, on\r\nthe Rio Grande, in the beginning of the Mexican war, and was answered\r\nthat the attack on Fort Brown had been made with small-arms, or at great\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nAfter the removal of the garrison to the stronger and safer position of\r\nFort Sumter, I called upon him again to represent, from my knowledge of\r\nthe people and the circumstances of the case, how productive the\r\nmovement would be of discontent, and how likely to lead to collision.\r\nOne of the vexed questions of the day was, by what authority the\r\ncollector of the port should be appointed, and the rumor was, that\r\ninstructions had been given to the commanding officer at Fort Sumter not\r\nto allow vessels to pass, unless under clearance from the United States\r\ncollector. It was easy to understand that, if a vessel were fired upon\r\nunder such circumstances, it would be accepted as the beginning of\r\nhostilities--a result which both he and I desired to avert, as the\r\ngreatest calamity that could be foreseen or imagined. My opinion was,\r\nthat the wisest and best course would be to withdraw the garrison\r\naltogether from the harbor of Charleston.\r\n\r\nThe President's objection to this was, that it was his bounden duty to\r\npreserve and protect the property of the United States. To this I\r\nreplied, with all the earnestness the occasion demanded, that I would\r\npledge my life that, if an inventory were taken of all the stores and\r\nmunitions in the fort, and an ordnance-sergeant with a few men left in\r\ncharge of them, they would not be disturbed. As a further guarantee, I\r\noffered to obtain from the Governor of South Carolina full assurance\r\nthat, in case any marauders or lawless combination of persons should\r\nattempt to seize or disturb the property, he would send from the citadel\r\nof Charleston an adequate guard to protect it and to secure its keepers\r\nagainst molestation.\r\n\r\nThe President promised me to reflect upon this proposition, and to\r\nconfer with his Cabinet upon the propriety of adopting it. All Cabinet\r\nconsultations are secret; which is equivalent to saying that I never\r\nknew what occurred in that meeting to which my proposition was\r\nsubmitted. The result was not communicated to me, but the events which\r\nfollowed proved that the suggestion was not accepted.\r\n\r\nMajor Anderson, who commanded the garrison, had many ties and\r\nassociations that bound him to the South. He performed his part like the\r\ntrue soldier and man of the finest sense of honor that he was; but that\r\nit was most painful to him to be charged with the duty of holding the\r\nfort as a threat to the people of Charleston is a fact known to many\r\nothers as well as to myself. We had been cadets together. He was my\r\nfirst acquaintance in that corps, and the friendship then formed was\r\nnever interrupted. We had served together in the summer and autumn of\r\n1860, in a commission of inquiry into the discipline, course of studies,\r\nand general condition of the United States Military Academy. At the\r\nclose of our labors the commission had adjourned, to meet again in\r\nWashington about the end of the ensuing November, to examine the report\r\nand revise it for transmission to Congress. Major Anderson's duties in\r\nCharleston Harbor hindered him from attending this adjourned meeting of\r\nthe commission, and he wrote to me, its chairman, to explain the cause\r\nof his absence. That letter was lost when my library and private papers\r\nwere \"captured\" from my home in Mississippi. If any one has preserved it\r\nas a trophy of war, its publication would show how bright was the honor,\r\nhow broad the patriotism of Major Anderson, and how fully he sympathized\r\nwith me as to the evils which then lowered over the country.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the past and the present among the mighty changes which\r\npassion and sectional hostility have wrought, one is profoundly and\r\npainfully impressed by the extent to which public opinion has drifted\r\nfrom the landmarks set up by the sages and patriots who formed the\r\nconstitutional Union, and observed by those who administered its\r\ngovernment down to the time when war between the States was inaugurated.\r\nMr. Buchanan, the last President of the old school, would as soon have\r\nthought of aiding in the establishment of a monarchy among us as of\r\naccepting the doctrine of coercing the States into submission to the\r\nwill of a majority, in mass, of the people of the United States. When\r\ndiscussing the question of withdrawing the troops from the port of\r\nCharleston, he yielded a ready assent to the proposition that the\r\ncession of a site for a fort, for purposes of public defense, lapses,\r\nwhenever that fort should be employed by the grantee against the State\r\nby which the cession was made, on the familiar principle that any grant\r\nfor a specific purpose expires when it ceases to be used for that\r\npurpose. Whether on this or any other ground, if the garrison of Fort\r\nSumter had been withdrawn in accordance with the spirit of the\r\nConstitution of the United States, from which the power to apply\r\ncoercion to a State was deliberately and designedly excluded, and if\r\nthis had been distinctly assigned as a reason for its withdrawal, the\r\nhonor of the United States Government would have been maintained intact,\r\nand nothing could have operated more powerfully to quiet the\r\napprehensions and allay the resentment of the people of South Carolina.\r\nThe influence which such a measure would have exerted upon the States\r\nwhich had not yet seceded, but were then contemplating the adoption of\r\nthat extreme remedy, would probably have induced further delay; and the\r\nmellowing effect of time, with a realization of the dangers to be\r\nincurred, might have wrought mutual forbearance--if, indeed, anything\r\ncould have checked the madness then prevailing among the people of the\r\nNorthern States in their thirst for power and forgetfulness of the\r\nduties of federation.\r\n\r\nIt would have been easy to concede this point. The little garrison of\r\nFort Sumter served only as a menace; for it was utterly incapable of\r\nholding the fort if attacked, and the poor attempt soon afterward made\r\nto reënforce and provision it, by such a vessel as the Star of the West,\r\nmight by the uncharitable be readily construed as a scheme to provoke\r\nhostilities. Yet, from my knowledge of Mr. Buchanan, I do not hesitate\r\nto say that he had no such wish or purpose. His abiding hope was to\r\navert a collision, or at least to postpone it to a period beyond the\r\nclose of his official term. The management of the whole affair was what\r\nTalleyrand describes as something worse than a crime--a blunder.\r\nWhatever treatment the case demanded, should have been prompt; to wait\r\nwas fatuity.\r\n\r\nThe ill-advised attempt secretly to throw reënforcements and provisions\r\ninto Fort Sumter, by means of the steamer Star of the West, resulted in\r\nthe repulsion of that vessel at the mouth of the harbor, by the\r\nauthorities of South Carolina, on the morning of the 9th of January. On\r\nher refusal to heave-to, she was fired upon, and put back to sea, with\r\nher recruits and supplies. A telegraphic account of this event was\r\nhanded me, a few hours afterward, when stepping into my carriage to go\r\nto the Senate-chamber. Although I had then, for some time, ceased to\r\nvisit the President, yet, under the impulse of this renewed note of\r\ndanger to the country, I drove immediately to the Executive mansion, and\r\nfor the last time appealed to him to take such prompt measures as were\r\nevidently necessary to avert the impending calamity. The result was even\r\nmore unsatisfactory than that of former efforts had been.\r\n\r\nOn the same day the special message of the President on the state of the\r\nUnion, dated the day previous (8th of January), was submitted to\r\nCongress. This message was accompanied by the _first_ letter of the\r\nSouth Carolina Commissioners to the President, with his answer, but of\r\ncourse _not_ by their rejoinder, which he had declined to receive. Mr.\r\nBuchanan, in his memoirs, complains that, immediately after the reading\r\nof his message, this rejoinder (which he terms an \"insulting letter\")\r\nwas presented by me to the Senate, and by that body received and entered\r\nupon its journal.[119] The simple truth is, that, regarding it as\r\nessential to a complete understanding of the transaction, and its\r\npublication as a mere act of justice to the Commissioners, I presented\r\nand had it read in the Senate. But its appearance upon the journal as\r\npart of the proceedings, instead of being merely a document introduced\r\nas part of my remarks, was the result of a discourteous objection, made\r\nby a so-called \"Republican\" Senator, to the reading of the document by\r\nthe Clerk of the Senate at my request. This will be made manifest by an\r\nexamination of the debate and proceedings which ensued.[120] The\r\ndiscourtesy recoiled upon its author and supporters, and gave the letter\r\na vantage-ground in respect of prominence which I could not have\r\nforeseen or expected.\r\n\r\nThe next day (January 10th) the speech was delivered, the greater part\r\nof which may be found in the Appendix[121]--the last that I ever made in\r\nthe Senate of the United States, except in taking leave, and by the\r\nsentiments of which I am content that my career, both before and since,\r\nshould be judged.\r\n\r\nThe history of Fort Sumter during the remaining period, until the\r\norganization of the Confederate Government, may be found in the\r\ncorrespondence given in the Appendix.[122] From this it will be seen\r\nthat the authorities of South Carolina still continued to refrain from\r\nany act of aggression or retaliation, under the provocation of the\r\nsecret attempt to reënforce the garrison, as they had previously under\r\nthat of its nocturnal transfer from one fort to another.\r\n\r\nAnother Commissioner (the Hon. I. W. Hayne) was sent to Washington by\r\nthe Governor of South Carolina, to effect, if possible, an amicable and\r\npeaceful transfer of the fort, and settlement of all questions relating\r\nto property. This Commissioner remained for nearly a month, endeavoring\r\nto accomplish the objects of his mission, but was met only by evasive\r\nand unsatisfactory answers, and eventually returned without having\r\neffected anything.\r\n\r\nThere is one passage in the last letter of Colonel Hayne to the\r\nPresident which presents the case of the occupancy of Fort Sumter by the\r\nUnited States troops so clearly and forcibly that it may be proper to\r\nquote it. He writes as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"You say that the fort was garrisoned for our protection, and is\r\n    held for the same purposes for which it has been ever held since\r\n    its construction. Are you not aware, that to hold, in the\r\n    territory of a foreign power, a fortress against her will,\r\n    avowedly for the purpose of protecting her citizens, is perhaps\r\n    the highest insult which one government can offer to another?\r\n    But Fort Sumter was never garrisoned at all until South Carolina\r\n    had dissolved her connection with your Government. This garrison\r\n    entered it in the night, with every circumstance of secrecy,\r\n    after spiking the guns and burning the gun-carriages and cutting\r\n    down the flag-staff of an adjacent fort, which was then\r\n    abandoned. South Carolina had not taken Fort Sumter into her own\r\n    possession, only because of her misplaced confidence in a\r\n    Government which deceived her.\"\r\n\r\nThus, during the remainder of Mr. Buchanan's Administration, matters\r\nwent rapidly from bad to worse. The old statesman, who, with all his\r\ndefects, had long possessed, and was entitled still to retain, the\r\nconfidence due to extensive political knowledge and love of his country\r\nin all its parts--who had, in his earlier career, looked steadily to the\r\nConstitution, as the mariner looks to the compass, for guidance--retired\r\nto private life at the expiration of his term of office, having effected\r\nnothing to allay the storm which had been steadily gathering during his\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nTimid vacillation was then succeeded by unscrupulous cunning; and, for\r\nfutile efforts, without hostile collision, to impose a claim of\r\nauthority upon people who repudiated it, were substituted measures which\r\ncould be sustained only by force.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: \"Revised Statutes of Massachusetts,\" 1836, p. 56.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: See \"Revised Statutes of Virginia.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: \"Buchanan's Administration,\" chap. ix, p. 165, and chap.\r\nxi, pp. 212-214.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: \"Buchanan's Administration,\" chap. ix, p. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: Ibid., chap. x, p. 180.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: See Appendix G.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: \"Buchanan's Administration,\" chap. x, pp. 187, 188.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: \"Buchanan's Administration,\" chap. x, p. 184.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: See \"Congressional Globe,\" second session, Thirty-fifth\r\nCongress, Part I, p. 284, _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: See Appendix I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n    Secession of Mississippi and Other States.--Withdrawal of\r\n    Senators.--Address of the Author on taking Leave of the\r\n    Senate.--Answer to Certain Objections.\r\n\r\n\r\nMississippi was the second State to withdraw from the Union, her\r\nordinance of secession being adopted on the 9th of January, 1861. She\r\nwas quickly followed by Florida on the 10th, Alabama on the 11th, and,\r\nin the course of the same month, by Georgia on the 18th, and Louisiana\r\non the 26th. The Conventions of these States (together with that of\r\nSouth Carolina) agreed in designating Montgomery, Alabama, as the place,\r\nand the 4th of February as the day, for the assembling of a congress of\r\nthe seceding States, to which each State Convention, acting as the\r\ndirect representative of the sovereignty of the people thereof,\r\nappointed delegates.\r\n\r\nTelegraphic intelligence of the secession of Mississippi had reached\r\nWashington some considerable time before the fact was officially\r\ncommunicated to me. This official knowledge I considered it proper to\r\nawait before taking formal leave of the Senate. My associates from\r\nAlabama and Florida concurred in this view. Accordingly, having received\r\nnotification of the secession of these three States about the same time,\r\non the 21st of January Messrs. Yulee and Mallory, of Florida,\r\nFitzpatrick and Clay, of Alabama, and myself, announced the withdrawal\r\nof the States from which we were respectively accredited, and took leave\r\nof the Senate at the same time.\r\n\r\nIn the action which she then took, Mississippi certainly had no purpose\r\nto levy war against the United States, or any of them. As her Senator, I\r\nendeavored plainly to state her position in the annexed remarks\r\naddressed to the Senate in taking leave of the body:\r\n\r\n    \"I rise, Mr. President, for the purpose of announcing to the\r\n    Senate that I have satisfactory evidence that the State of\r\n    Mississippi, by a solemn ordinance of her people, in convention\r\n    assembled, has declared her separation from the United States.\r\n    Under these circumstances, of course, my functions are\r\n    terminated here. It has seemed to me proper, however, that I\r\n    should appear in the Senate to announce that fact to my\r\n    associates, and I will say but very little more. The occasion\r\n    does not invite me to go into argument; and my physical\r\n    condition would not permit me to do so, if it were otherwise;\r\n    and yet it seems to become me to say something on the part of\r\n    the State I here represent on an occasion so solemn as this.\r\n\r\n    \"It is known to Senators who have served with me here that I\r\n    have for many years advocated, as an essential attribute of\r\n    State sovereignty, the right of a State to secede from the\r\n    Union. Therefore, if I had not believed there was justifiable\r\n    cause, if I had thought that Mississippi was acting without\r\n    sufficient provocation, or without an existing necessity, I\r\n    should still, under my theory of the Government, because of my\r\n    allegiance to the State of which I am a citizen, have been bound\r\n    by her action. I, however, may be permitted to say that I do\r\n    think she has justifiable cause, and I approve of her act. I\r\n    conferred with her people before that act was taken, counseled\r\n    them then that, if the state of things which they apprehended\r\n    should exist when their Convention met, they should take the\r\n    action which they have now adopted.\r\n\r\n    \"I hope none who hear me will confound this expression of mine\r\n    with the advocacy of the right of a State to remain in the\r\n    Union, and to disregard its constitutional obligations by the\r\n    nullification of the law. Such is not my theory. Nullification\r\n    and secession, so often confounded, are, indeed, antagonistic\r\n    principles. Nullification is a remedy which it is sought to\r\n    apply within the Union, and against the agent of the States. It\r\n    is only to be justified when the agent has violated his\r\n    constitutional obligations, and a State, assuming to judge for\r\n    itself, denies the right of the agent thus to act, and appeals\r\n    to the other States of the Union for a decision; but, when the\r\n    States themselves and when the people of the States have so\r\n    acted as to convince us that they will not regard our\r\n    constitutional rights, then, and then for the first time, arises\r\n    the doctrine of secession in its practical application.\r\n\r\n    \"A great man who now reposes with his fathers, and who has often\r\n    been arraigned for a want of fealty to the Union, advocated the\r\n    doctrine of nullification because it preserved the Union. It was\r\n    because of his deep-seated attachment to the Union--his\r\n    determination to find some remedy for existing ills short of a\r\n    severance of the ties which bound South Carolina to the other\r\n    States--that Mr. Calhoun advocated the doctrine of\r\n    nullification, which he proclaimed to be peaceful, to be within\r\n    the limits of State power, not to disturb the Union, but only to\r\n    be a means of bringing the agent before the tribunal of the\r\n    States for their judgment.\r\n\r\n    \"Secession belongs to a different class of remedies. It is to be\r\n    justified upon the basis that the States are sovereign. There\r\n    was a time when none denied it. I hope the time may come again\r\n    when a better comprehension of the theory of our Government, and\r\n    the inalienable rights of the people of the States, will prevent\r\n    any one from denying that each State is a sovereign, and thus\r\n    may reclaim the grants which it has made to any agent\r\n    whomsoever.\r\n\r\n    \"I, therefore, say I concur in the action of the people of\r\n    Mississippi, believing it to be necessary and proper, and should\r\n    have been bound by their action if my belief had been otherwise;\r\n    and this brings me to the important point which I wish, on this\r\n    last occasion, to present to the Senate. It is by this\r\n    confounding of nullification and secession that the name of a\r\n    great man whose ashes now mingle with his mother earth has been\r\n    evoked to justify coercion against a seceded State. The phrase,\r\n    'to execute the laws,' was an expression which General Jackson\r\n    applied to the case of a State refusing to obey the laws while\r\n    yet a member of the Union. That is not the case which is now\r\n    presented. The laws are to be executed over the United States,\r\n    and upon the people of the United States. They have no relation\r\n    to any foreign country. It is a perversion of terms--at least,\r\n    it is a great misapprehension of the case--which cites that\r\n    expression for application to a State which has withdrawn from\r\n    the Union. You may make war on a foreign state. If it be the\r\n    purpose of gentlemen, they may make war against a State which\r\n    has withdrawn from the Union; but there are no laws of the\r\n    United States to be executed within the limits of a seceded\r\n    State. A State, finding herself in the condition in which\r\n    Mississippi has judged she is--in which her safety requires that\r\n    she should provide for the maintenance of her rights out of the\r\n    Union--surrenders all the benefits (and they are known to be\r\n    many), deprives herself of the advantages (and they are known to\r\n    be great), severs all the ties of affection (and they are close\r\n    and enduring), which have bound her to the Union; and thus\r\n    divesting herself of every benefit--taking upon herself every\r\n    burden--she claims to be exempt from any power to execute the\r\n    laws of the United States within her limits.\r\n\r\n    \"I well remember an occasion when Massachusetts was arraigned\r\n    before the bar of the Senate, and when the doctrine of coercion\r\n    was rife, and to be applied against her, because of the rescue\r\n    of a fugitive slave in Boston. My opinion then was the same that\r\n    it is now. Not in a spirit of egotism, but to show that I am not\r\n    influenced in my opinions because the case is my own, I refer to\r\n    that time and that occasion as containing the opinion which I\r\n    then entertained, and on which my present conduct is based. I\r\n    then said that if Massachusetts--following her purpose through a\r\n    stated line of conduct--chose to take the last step, which\r\n    separates her from the Union, it is her right to go, and I will\r\n    neither vote one dollar nor one man to coerce her back; but I\r\n    will say to her, Godspeed, in memory of the kind associations\r\n    which once existed between her and the other States.\r\n\r\n    \"It has been a conviction of pressing necessity--it has been a\r\n    belief that we are to be deprived in the Union of the rights\r\n    which our fathers bequeathed to us--which has brought\r\n    Mississippi to her present decision. She has heard proclaimed\r\n    the theory that all men are created free and equal, and this\r\n    made the basis of an attack upon her social institutions; and\r\n    the sacred Declaration of Independence has been invoked to\r\n    maintain the position of the equality of the races. That\r\n    Declaration of Independence is to be construed by the\r\n    circumstances and purposes for which it was made. The\r\n    communities were declaring their independence; the people of\r\n    those communities were asserting that no man was born--to use\r\n    the language of Mr. Jefferson--booted and spurred, to ride over\r\n    the rest of mankind; that men were created equal--meaning the\r\n    men of the political community; that there was no divine right\r\n    to rule; that no man inherited the right to govern; that there\r\n    were no classes by which power and place descended to families;\r\n    but that all stations were equally within the grasp of each\r\n    member of the body politic. These were the great principles they\r\n    announced; these were the purposes for which they made their\r\n    declaration; these were the ends to which their enunciation was\r\n    directed. They have no reference to the slave; else, how\r\n    happened it that among the items of arraignment against George\r\n    III was that he endeavored to do just what the North has been\r\n    endeavoring of late to do, to stir up insurrection among our\r\n    slaves? Had the Declaration announced that the negroes were free\r\n    and equal, how was the prince to be arraigned for raising up\r\n    insurrection among them? And how was this to be enumerated among\r\n    the high crimes which caused the colonies to sever their\r\n    connection with the mother-country? When our Constitution was\r\n    formed, the same idea was rendered more palpable; for there we\r\n    find provision made for that very class of persons as property;\r\n    they were not put upon the footing of equality with white\r\n    men--not even upon that of paupers and convicts; but, so far as\r\n    representation was concerned, were discriminated against as a\r\n    lower caste, only to be represented in the numerical proportion\r\n    of three fifths. So stands the compact which binds us together.\r\n\r\n    \"Then, Senators, we recur to the principles upon which our\r\n    Government was founded; and when you deny them, and when you\r\n    deny to us the right to withdraw from a Government which, thus\r\n    perverted, threatens to be destructive of our rights, we but\r\n    tread in the path of our fathers when we proclaim our\r\n    independence and take the hazard. This is done, not in hostility\r\n    to others, not to injure any section of the country, not even\r\n    for our own pecuniary benefit, but from the high and solemn\r\n    motive of defending and protecting the rights we inherited, and\r\n    which it is our duty to transmit unshorn to our children.\r\n\r\n    \"I find in myself perhaps a type of the general feeling of my\r\n    constituents toward yours. I am sure I feel no hostility toward\r\n    you, Senators from the North. I am sure there is not one of you,\r\n    whatever sharp discussion there may have been between us, to\r\n    whom I can not now say, in the presence of my God, I wish you\r\n    well; and such, I am sure, is the feeling of the people whom I\r\n    represent toward those whom you represent. I, therefore, feel\r\n    that I but express their desire when I say I hope, and they\r\n    hope, for peaceable relations with you, though we must part.\r\n    They may be mutually beneficial to us in the future, as they\r\n    have been in the past, if you so will it. The reverse may bring\r\n    disaster on every portion of the country, and, if you will have\r\n    it thus, we will invoke the God of our fathers, who delivered\r\n    them from the power of the lion, to protect us from the ravages\r\n    of the bear; and thus, putting our trust in God and in our firm\r\n    hearts and strong arms, we will vindicate the right as best we\r\n    may.\r\n\r\n    \"In the course of my service here, associated at different times\r\n    with a great variety of Senators, I see now around me some with\r\n    whom I have served long; there have been points of collision,\r\n    but, whatever of offense there has been to me, I leave here. I\r\n    carry with me no hostile remembrance. Whatever offense I have\r\n    given which has not been redressed, or for which satisfaction\r\n    has not been demanded, I have, Senators, in this hour of our\r\n    parting, to offer you my apology for any pain which, in the heat\r\n    of discussion, I have inflicted. I go hence unencumbered by the\r\n    remembrance of any injury received, and having discharged the\r\n    duty of making the only reparation in my power for any injury\r\n    offered.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. President and Senators, having made the announcement which\r\n    the occasion seemed to me to require, it only remains for me to\r\n    bid you a final adieu.\"\r\n\r\nThere are some who contend that we should have retained\r\nour seats and \"fought for our rights in the Union.\" Could\r\nanything be less rational or less consistent than that a Senator,\r\nan ambassador from his State, should insist upon representing\r\nit in a confederacy from which the State has withdrawn?\r\nWhat was meant by \"fighting in the Union\" I have never\r\nquite understood. If it be to retain a seat in Congress for the\r\npurpose of crippling the Government and rendering it unable to\r\nperform its functions, I can certainly not appreciate the idea of\r\nhonor that sanctions the suggestion. Among the advantages\r\nclaimed for this proposition by its supporters was that of thwarting\r\nthe President in the appointment of his Cabinet and other\r\nofficers necessary for the administration of public affairs.\r\nWould this have been to maintain the Union formed by the\r\nStates? Would such have been the Government which Washington\r\nrecommended as a remedy for the defects of the original\r\nConfederation, the greatest of which was the paralysis of the\r\naction of the general agent by the opposition or indifference of\r\nthe States? Sad as have been the consequences of the war\r\nwhich followed secession--disastrous in its moral, material, and\r\npolitical relations--still we have good cause to feel proud that\r\nthe course of the Southern States has left no blot nor stain upon\r\nthe honor and chivalry of their people.\r\n\r\n  \"And if our children must obey,\r\n  They must, but--thinking on our day--\r\n  'Twill less debase them to submit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    Threats of Arrest.--Departure from Washington.--Indications of\r\n    Public Anxiety.--\"Will there be war?\"--Organization of the \"Army\r\n    of Mississippi.\"--Lack of Preparations for Defense in the\r\n    South.--Evidences of the Good Faith and Peaceable Purposes of\r\n    the Southern People.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the interval between the announcement by telegraph of the\r\nsecession of Mississippi and the receipt of the official notification\r\nwhich enabled me to withdraw from the Senate, rumors were in circulation\r\nof a purpose, on the part of the United States Government, to arrest\r\nmembers of Congress preparing to leave Washington on account of the\r\nsecession of the States which they represented. This threat received\r\nlittle attention from those most concerned. Indeed, it was thought that\r\nit might not be an undesirable mode of testing the question of the right\r\nof a State to withdraw from the Union.\r\n\r\nNo attempt, however, was made to arrest any of the retiring members;\r\nand, after a delay of a few days in necessary preparations, I left\r\nWashington for Mississippi, passing through southwestern Virginia, East\r\nTennessee, a small part of Georgia, and north Alabama. A deep interest\r\nin the events which had recently occurred was exhibited by the people of\r\nthese States, and much anxiety was indicated as to the future. Many\r\nyears of agitation had made them familiar with the idea of separation.\r\nNearly two generations had risen to manhood since it had begun to be\r\ndiscussed as a possible alternative. Few, very few, of the Southern\r\npeople had ever regarded it as a desirable event, or otherwise than as a\r\nlast resort for escape from evils more intolerable. It was a calamity,\r\nwhich, however threatened, they had still hoped might be averted, or\r\nindefinitely postponed, and they had regarded with contempt, rather than\r\nanger, the ravings of a party in the North, which denounced the\r\nConstitution and the Union, and persistently defamed their brethren of\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\nNow, however, as well in Virginia and Tennessee, neither of which had\r\nyet seceded, as in the more Southern States, which had already taken\r\nthat step, the danger so often prophesied was perceived to be at the\r\ndoor, and eager inquiries were made as to what would happen\r\nnext--especially as to the probability of war between the States.\r\n\r\nThe course which events were likely to take was shrouded in the greatest\r\nuncertainty. In the minds of many there was the not unreasonable hope\r\n(which had been expressed by the Commissioner sent from Mississippi to\r\nMaryland) that the secession of six Southern States--certainly soon to\r\nbe followed by that of others--would so arouse the sober thought and\r\nbetter feeling of the Northern people as to compel their representatives\r\nto agree to a Convention of the States, and that such guarantees would\r\nbe given as would secure to the South the domestic tranquillity and\r\nequality in the Union which were rights assured under the Federal\r\ncompact. There were others, and they the most numerous class, who\r\nconsidered that the separation would be final, but peaceful. For my own\r\npart, while believing that secession was a right, and properly a\r\npeaceable remedy, I had never believed that it would be permitted to be\r\npeaceably exercised. Very few in the South at that time agreed with me,\r\nand my answers to queries on the subject were, therefore, as unexpected\r\nas they were unwelcome.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at Jackson, the capital of Mississippi, I found that the\r\nConvention of the State had made provision for a State army, and had\r\nappointed me to the command, with the rank of major-general. Four\r\nbrigadier-generals, appointed in like manner by the Convention, were\r\nawaiting my arrival for assignment to duty. After the preparation of the\r\nnecessary rules and regulations, the division of the State into\r\ndistricts, the apportionment among them of the troops to be raised, and\r\nthe appointment of officers of the general staff, as authorized by the\r\nordinance of the Convention, such measures as were practicable were\r\ntaken to obtain the necessary arms. The State had few serviceable\r\nweapons, and no establishment for their manufacture or repair. This fact\r\n(which is true of other Southern States as of Mississippi) is a clear\r\nproof of the absence of any desire or expectation of war. If the purpose\r\nof the Northern States to make war upon us because of secession had been\r\nforeseen, preparation to meet the consequences would have been\r\ncontemporaneous with the adoption of a resort to that remedy--a remedy\r\nthe possibility of which had for many years been contemplated. Had the\r\nSouthern States possessed arsenals, and collected in them the requisite\r\nsupplies of arms and munitions, such preparation would not only have\r\nplaced them more nearly on an equality with the North in the beginning\r\nof the war, but might, perhaps, have been the best conservator of peace.\r\n\r\nLet us, the survivors, however, not fail to do credit to the generous\r\ncredulity which could not understand how, in violation of the compact of\r\nUnion, a war could be waged against the States, or why they should be\r\ninvaded because their people had deemed it necessary to withdraw from an\r\nassociation which had failed to fulfill the ends for which they had\r\nentered into it, and which, having been broken to their injury by the\r\nother parties, had ceased to be binding upon them. It is a satisfaction\r\nto know that the calamities which have befallen the Southern States were\r\nthe result of their credulous reliance on the power of the Constitution,\r\nthat, if it failed to protect their rights, it would at least suffice to\r\nprevent an attempt at coercion, if, in the last resort, they peacefully\r\nwithdrew from the Union.\r\n\r\nWhen, in after times, the passions of the day shall have subsided, and\r\nall the evidence shall have been collected and compared, the\r\nphilosophical inquirer, who asks why the majority of the stronger\r\nsection invaded the peaceful homes of their late associates, will be\r\nanswered by History: \"The lust of empire impelled them to wage against\r\ntheir weaker neighbors a war of subjugation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n    Meeting of the Provisional Congress of the Confederate\r\n    States.--Adoption of a Provisional Constitution.--Election of\r\n    President and Vice-President.--Notification to the Author of his\r\n    Election.--His Views with Regard to it.--Journey to\r\n    Montgomery.--Interview with Judge Sharkey.--False Reports of\r\n    Speeches on the Way.--Inaugural Address.--Editor's Note.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe congress of delegates from the seceding States convened at\r\nMontgomery, Alabama, according to appointment, on the 4th of February,\r\n1861. Their first work was to prepare a provisional Constitution for the\r\nnew Confederacy, to be formed of the States which had withdrawn from the\r\nUnion, for which the style \"Confederate States of America\" was adopted.\r\nThe powers conferred upon them were adequate for the performance of this\r\nduty, the immediate necessity for which was obvious and urgent. This\r\nConstitution was adopted on the 8th of February, to continue in force\r\nfor one year, unless superseded at an earlier date by a permanent\r\norganization. It is printed in an appendix, and for convenience of\r\nreference the permanent Constitution, adopted several weeks afterward,\r\nis exhibited in connection with it, and side by side with the\r\nConstitution of the United States, after which it was modeled.[123] The\r\nattention of the reader is invited to these documents and to a\r\ncomparison of them, although a more particular notice of the permanent\r\nConstitution will be more appropriate hereafter.\r\n\r\nOn the next day (9th of February) an election was held for the chief\r\nexecutive offices, resulting, as I afterward learned, in my election to\r\nthe Presidency, with the Hon. Alexander H. Stephens, of Georgia, as\r\nVice-President. Mr. Stephens was a delegate from Georgia to the\r\ncongress.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were occurring, having completed the most urgent of\r\nmy duties at the capital of Mississippi, I had gone to my home,\r\nBrierfield, in Warren County, and had begun, in the homely but\r\nexpressive language of Mr. Clay, \"to repair my fences.\" While thus\r\nengaged, notice was received of my election to the Presidency of the\r\nConfederate States, with an urgent request to proceed immediately to\r\nMontgomery for inauguration.\r\n\r\nAs this had been suggested as a probable event, and what appeared to me\r\nadequate precautions had been taken to prevent it, I was surprised, and,\r\nstill more, disappointed. For reasons which it is not now necessary to\r\nstate, I had not believed my self as well suited to the office as some\r\nothers. I thought myself better adapted to command in the field; and\r\nMississippi had given me the position which I preferred to any\r\nother--the highest rank in her army. It was, therefore, that I afterward\r\nsaid, in an address delivered in the Capitol, before the Legislature of\r\nthe State, with reference to my election to the Presidency of the\r\nConfederacy, that the duty to which I was thus called was temporary, and\r\nthat I expected soon to be with the Army of Mississippi again.\r\n\r\nWhile on my way to Montgomery, and waiting in Jackson, Mississippi, for\r\nthe railroad train, I met the Hon. William L. Sharkey, who had filled\r\nwith great distinction the office of Chief-Justice of the State. He said\r\nhe was looking for me to make an inquiry. He desired to know if it was\r\ntrue, as he had just learned, that I believed there _would_ be war. My\r\nopinion was freely given, that there would be war, long and bloody, and\r\nthat it behooved every one to put his house in order. He expressed much\r\nsurprise, and said that he had not believed the report attributing this\r\nopinion to me. He asked how I supposed war could result from the\r\npeaceable withdrawal of a sovereign State. The answer was, that it was\r\nnot my opinion that war _should_ be occasioned by the exercise of that\r\nright, but that it _would_ be.\r\n\r\nJudge Sharkey and I had not belonged to the same political party, he\r\nbeing a Whig, but we fully agreed with regard to the question of the\r\nsovereignty of the States. He had been an advocate of nullification--a\r\ndoctrine to which I had never assented, and which had at one time been\r\nthe main issue in Mississippi politics. He had presided over the\r\nwell-remembered Nashville Convention in 1849, and had possessed much\r\ninfluence in the State, not only as an eminent jurist, but as a citizen\r\nwho had grown up with it, and held many offices of honor and trust.\r\n\r\nOn my way to Montgomery, brief addresses were made at various places, at\r\nwhich there were temporary stoppages of the trains, in response to calls\r\nfrom the crowds assembled at such points. Some of these addresses were\r\ngrossly misrepresented in sensational reports made by irresponsible\r\npersons, which were published in Northern newspapers, and were not\r\nconsidered worthy of correction under the pressure of the momentous\r\nduties then devolving upon me. These false reports, which represented me\r\nas invoking war and threatening devastation of the North, have since\r\nbeen adopted by partisan writers as authentic history. It is a\r\nsufficient answer to these accusations to refer to my farewell address\r\nto the Senate, already given, as reported for the press at the time,\r\nand, in connection therewith, to my inaugural address at Montgomery, on\r\nassuming the office of President of the Confederate States, on the 18th\r\nof February. These two addresses, delivered at an interval of a month,\r\nduring which no material change of circumstances had occurred, being one\r\nbefore and the other after the date of the sensational reports referred\r\nto, are sufficient to stamp them as utterly untrue. The inaugural was\r\ndeliberately prepared, and uttered as written, and, in connection with\r\nthe farewell speech to the Senate, presents a clear and authentic\r\nstatement of the principles and purposes which actuated me on assuming\r\nthe duties of the high office to which I had been called.\r\n\r\n    INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n    \"_Gentlemen of the Congress of the Confederate States of\r\n    America, Friends, and Fellow-Citizens:_\r\n\r\n    \"Called to the difficult and responsible station of Chief\r\n    Magistrate of the Provisional Government which you have\r\n    instituted, I approach the discharge of the duties assigned to\r\n    me with humble distrust of my abilities, but with a sustaining\r\n    confidence in the wisdom of those who are to guide and aid me in\r\n    the administration of public affairs, and an abiding faith in\r\n    the virtue and patriotism of the people. Looking forward to the\r\n    speedy establishment of a permanent government to take the place\r\n    of this, which by its greater moral and physical power will be\r\n    better able to combat with many difficulties that arise from the\r\n    conflicting interests of separate nations, I enter upon the\r\n    duties of the office to which I have been chosen with the hope\r\n    that the beginning of our career, as a Confederacy, may not be\r\n    obstructed by hostile opposition to our enjoyment of the\r\n    separate existence and independence we have asserted, and which,\r\n    with the blessing of Providence, we intend to maintain.\r\n\r\n    \"Our present political position has been achieved in a manner\r\n    unprecedented in the history of nations. It illustrates the\r\n    American idea that governments rest on the consent of the\r\n    governed, and that it is the right of the people to alter or\r\n    abolish them at will whenever they become destructive of the\r\n    ends for which they were established. The declared purpose of\r\n    the compact of the Union from which we have withdrawn was to\r\n    'establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for\r\n    the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the\r\n    blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity'; and when,\r\n    in the judgment of the sovereign States composing this\r\n    Confederacy, it has been perverted from the purposes for which\r\n    it was ordained, and ceased to answer the ends for which it was\r\n    established, a peaceful appeal to the ballot-box declared that,\r\n    so far as they are concerned, the Government created by that\r\n    compact should cease to exist. In this they merely asserted the\r\n    right which the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776,\r\n    defined to be 'inalienable.' Of the time and occasion of its\r\n    exercise they as sovereigns were the final judges, each for\r\n    itself. The impartial and enlightened verdict of mankind will\r\n    vindicate the rectitude of our conduct; and He who knows the\r\n    hearts of men will judge of the sincerity with which we have\r\n    labored to preserve the Government of our fathers in its spirit.\r\n\r\n    \"The right solemnly proclaimed at the birth of the United\r\n    States, and which has been solemnly affirmed and reaffirmed in\r\n    the Bills of Rights of the States subsequently admitted into the\r\n    Union of 1789, undeniably recognizes in the people the power to\r\n    resume the authority delegated for the purposes of government.\r\n    Thus the sovereign States here represented have proceeded to\r\n    form this Confederacy; and it is by abuse of language that their\r\n    act has been denominated a revolution. They formed a new\r\n    alliance, but within each State its government has remained; so\r\n    that the rights of person and property have not been disturbed.\r\n    The agent through which they communicated with foreign nations\r\n    is changed, but this does not necessarily interrupt their\r\n    international relations. Sustained by the consciousness that the\r\n    transition from the former Union to the present Confederacy has\r\n    not proceeded from a disregard on our part of just obligations,\r\n    or any failure to perform every constitutional duty, moved by no\r\n    interest or passion to invade the rights of others, anxious to\r\n    cultivate peace and commerce with all nations, if we may not\r\n    hope to avoid war, we may at least expect that posterity will\r\n    acquit us of having needlessly engaged in it. Doubly justified\r\n    by the absence of wrong on our part, and by wanton aggression on\r\n    the part of others, there can be no cause to doubt that the\r\n    courage and patriotism of the people of the Confederate States\r\n    will be found equal to any measure of defense which their honor\r\n    and security may require.\r\n\r\n    \"An agricultural people, whose chief interest is the export of\r\n    commodities required in every manufacturing country, our true\r\n    policy is peace, and the freest trade which our necessities will\r\n    permit. It is alike our interest and that of all those to whom\r\n    we would sell, and from whom we would buy, that there should be\r\n    the fewest practicable restrictions upon the interchange of\r\n    these commodities. There can, however, be but little rivalry\r\n    between ours and any manufacturing or navigating community, such\r\n    as the Northeastern States of the American Union. It must\r\n    follow, therefore, that mutual interest will invite to good-will\r\n    and kind offices on both parts. If, however, passion or lust of\r\n    dominion should cloud the judgment or inflame the ambition of\r\n    those States, we must prepare to meet the emergency and\r\n    maintain, by the final arbitrament of the sword, the position\r\n    which we have assumed among the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\n    \"We have entered upon the career of independence, and it must be\r\n    inflexibly pursued. Through many years of controversy with our\r\n    late associates of the Northern States, we have vainly\r\n    endeavored to secure tranquillity and obtain respect for the\r\n    rights to which we were entitled. As a necessity, not a choice,\r\n    we have resorted to the remedy of separation, and henceforth our\r\n    energies must be directed to the conduct of our own affairs, and\r\n    the perpetuity of the Confederacy which we have formed. If a\r\n    just perception of mutual interest shall permit us peaceably to\r\n    pursue our separate political career, my most earnest desire\r\n    will have been fulfilled. But if this be denied to us, and the\r\n    integrity of our territory and jurisdiction be assailed, it will\r\n    but remain for us with firm resolve to appeal to arms and invoke\r\n    the blessing of Providence on a just cause.\r\n\r\n    \"As a consequence of our new condition and relations, and with a\r\n    view to meet anticipated wants, it will be necessary to provide\r\n    for the speedy and efficient organization of branches of the\r\n    Executive department having special charge of foreign\r\n    intercourse, finance, military affairs, and the postal service.\r\n    For purposes of defense, the Confederate States may, under\r\n    ordinary circumstances, rely mainly upon the militia; but it is\r\n    deemed advisable, in the present condition of affairs, that\r\n    there should be a well-instructed and disciplined army, more\r\n    numerous than would usually be required on a peace\r\n    establishment. I also suggest that, for the protection of our\r\n    harbors and commerce on the high seas, a navy adapted to those\r\n    objects will be required. But this, as well as other subjects\r\n    appropriate to our necessities, have doubtless engaged the\r\n    attention of Congress.\r\n\r\n    \"With a Constitution differing only from that of our fathers in\r\n    so far as it is explanatory of their well-known intent, freed\r\n    from sectional conflicts, which have interfered with the pursuit\r\n    of the general welfare, it is not unreasonable to expect that\r\n    States from which we have recently parted may seek to unite\r\n    their fortunes to ours under the Government which we have\r\n    instituted. For this your Constitution makes adequate provision;\r\n    but beyond this, if I mistake not the judgment and will of the\r\n    people, a reunion with the States from which we have separated\r\n    is neither practicable nor desirable. To increase the power,\r\n    develop the resources, and promote the happiness of the\r\n    Confederacy, it is requisite that there should be so much of\r\n    homogeneity that the welfare of every portion shall be the aim\r\n    of the whole. When this does not exist, antagonisms are\r\n    engendered which must and should result in separation.\r\n\r\n    \"Actuated solely by the desire to preserve our own rights, and\r\n    promote our own welfare, the separation by the Confederate\r\n    States has been marked by no aggression upon others, and\r\n    followed by no domestic convulsion. Our industrial pursuits have\r\n    received no check, the cultivation of our fields has progressed\r\n    as heretofore, and, even should we be involved in war, there\r\n    would be no considerable diminution in the production of the\r\n    staples which have constituted our exports, and in which the\r\n    commercial world has an interest scarcely less than our own.\r\n    This common interest of the producer and consumer can only be\r\n    interrupted by exterior force which would obstruct the\r\n    transmission of our staples to foreign markets--a course of\r\n    conduct which would be as unjust, as it would be detrimental, to\r\n    manufacturing and commercial interests abroad.\r\n\r\n    \"Should reason guide the action of the Government from which we\r\n    have separated, a policy so detrimental to the civilized world,\r\n    the Northern States included, could not be dictated by even the\r\n    strongest desire to inflict injury upon us; but, if the contrary\r\n    should prove true, a terrible responsibility will rest upon it,\r\n    and the suffering of millions will bear testimony to the folly\r\n    and wickedness of our aggressors. In the mean time there will\r\n    remain to us, besides the ordinary means before suggested, the\r\n    well known resources for retaliation upon the commerce of an\r\n    enemy.\r\n\r\n    \"Experience in public stations, of subordinate grade to this\r\n    which your kindness has conferred, has taught me that toil and\r\n    care and disappointment are the price of official elevation. You\r\n    will see many errors to forgive, many deficiencies to tolerate;\r\n    but you shall not find in me either want of zeal or fidelity to\r\n    the cause that is to me the highest in hope, and of most\r\n    enduring affection. Your generosity has bestowed upon me an\r\n    undeserved distinction, one which I neither sought nor desired.\r\n    Upon the continuance of that sentiment, and upon your wisdom and\r\n    patriotism, I rely to direct and support me in the performance\r\n    of the duties required at my hands.\r\n\r\n    \"We have changed the constituent parts, but not the system of\r\n    government. The Constitution framed by our fathers is that of\r\n    these Confederate States. In their exposition of it, and in the\r\n    judicial construction it has received, we have a light which\r\n    reveals its true meaning.\r\n\r\n    \"Thus instructed as to the true meaning and just interpretation\r\n    of that instrument, and ever remembering that all offices are\r\n    but trusts held for the people, and that powers delegated are to\r\n    be strictly construed, I will hope by due diligence in the\r\n    performance of my duties, though I may disappoint your\r\n    expectations, yet to retain, when retiring, something of the\r\n    good-will and confidence which welcome my entrance into office.\r\n\r\n    \"It is joyous in the midst of perilous times to look around upon\r\n    a people united in heart, where one purpose of high resolve\r\n    animates and actuates the whole; where the sacrifices to be made\r\n    are not weighed in the balance against honor and right and\r\n    liberty and equality. Obstacles may retard, but they can not\r\n    long prevent, the progress of a movement sanctified by its\r\n    justice and sustained by a virtuous people. Reverently let us\r\n    invoke the God of our Fathers to guide and protect us in our\r\n    efforts to perpetuate the principles which by his blessing they\r\n    were able to vindicate, establish, and transmit to their\r\n    posterity. With the continuance of his favor ever gratefully\r\n    acknowledged, we may hopefully look forward to success, to\r\n    peace, and to prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nNote, _relative to the Election of President of the Confederate States\r\nunder the Provisional Constitution, and some Other Subjects referred to\r\nin the Foregoing Chapters._\r\n\r\nStatements having been made, seeming to imply that I was a candidate\r\n\"for the Presidency of the Confederate States; that my election was the\r\nresult of a misunderstanding, or of accidental complications\"; and also\r\nthat I held \"extreme views,\" and entertained at that period an\r\ninadequate conception of the magnitude of the war probably to be waged,\r\ninformation on the subject has been contributed by several distinguished\r\nmembers of the Provisional Congress, who still survive. From a number of\r\ntheir letters which have been published, the annexed extracts are given,\r\nparts being omitted which refer to matters not of historical interest.\r\n\r\nFrom a communication of the Hon. Alexander M. Clayton, of Mississippi,\r\nto the Memphis \"Appeal\" of June 21, 1870:\r\n\r\n    \"... I was at the time a member of the Provisional Congress from\r\n    Mississippi. Believing that Mr. Davis was the choice of the\r\n    South for the position of President, before repairing to\r\n    Montgomery I addressed him a letter to ascertain if he would\r\n    accept it. He replied that it was not the place he desired;\r\n    that, if he could have his choice, he would greatly prefer to be\r\n    in active service as commander-in-chief of the army, but that he\r\n    would give himself to the cause in any capacity whatever. That\r\n    was the only letter of which I have any knowledge that he wrote\r\n    on the subject, and that was shown to only a very few persons,\r\n    and only when I was asked if Mr. Davis would accept the\r\n    presidency....\r\n\r\n    \"There was no electioneering, no management, on the part of any\r\n    one. Each voter was left to determine for himself in whose hands\r\n    the destinies of the infant Confederacy should be placed. By a\r\n    law as fixed as gravitation itself, and as little disturbed by\r\n    outside influences, the minds of members centered upon Mr.\r\n    Davis.\r\n\r\n    \"After a few days of anxious, intense labor, the Provisional\r\n    Constitution was framed, and it became necessary to give it\r\n    vitality by putting some one at the head of the new\r\n    Government....\r\n\r\n    \"Without any effort on the part of the friends of either\r\n    [Messrs. Davis or Stephens], the election was made without the\r\n    slightest dissent. Of the accidental complications referred to,\r\n    I have not the least knowledge, and always thought that the\r\n    election of Mr. Davis arose from the spontaneous conviction of\r\n    his peculiar fitness. I have consulted no one on the subject,\r\n    and have appended my name only to avoid resting an important\r\n    fact upon anonymous authority. Very respectfully yours,\"\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"Alexander M. Clayton.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Hon. J. A. P. Campbell, of Mississippi, now a Justice of the\r\nSupreme Court of that State:\r\n\r\n    \"... If there was a delegate from Mississippi, or any other\r\n    State, who was opposed to the election of Jefferson Davis as\r\n    President of the Confederate States, I never heard of the fact.\r\n    I had the idea that Mr. Davis did not desire to be President,\r\n    and preferred to be in the military service, but no other man\r\n    was spoken of for President within my hearing....\r\n\r\n    \"It is within my personal knowledge that the statement of the\r\n    interview, that Mr. Davis did not have a just appreciation of\r\n    the serious character of the contest between the seceding States\r\n    and the Union, is wholly untrue. Mr. Davis, more than any man I\r\n    ever heard talk on the subject, had a correct apprehension of\r\n    the consequences of secession and of the magnitude of the war to\r\n    be waged to coerce the seceding States. While at Montgomery, he\r\n    expressed the belief that heavy fighting must occur, and that\r\n    Virginia was to be the chief battle-ground. Years prior to\r\n    secession, in his address before the Legislature and people of\r\n    Mississippi, Mr. Davis had earnestly advised extensive\r\n    preparation for the possible contingency of secession.\r\n\r\n    \"After the formation of the Confederate States, he was far in\r\n    advance of the Constitutional Convention and the Provisional\r\n    Congress, and, as I believe, of any man in it, in his views of\r\n    the gravity of the situation and the probable extent and\r\n    duration of the war, and of the provision which should be made\r\n    for the defense of the seceding States. Before secession, Mr.\r\n    Davis thought war would result from it; and, after secession, he\r\n    expressed the view that the war commenced would be an extensive\r\n    one. What he may have thought at a later day than the early part\r\n    of 1862, I do not know; but it is inconceivable that the\r\n    'interview' can be correct as to that.\r\n\r\n    \"The idea that Mr. Davis was so 'extreme' in his views is a new\r\n    one. He was extremely conservative on the subject of secession.\r\n\r\n    \"The suggestion that Mississippi would have preferred General\r\n    Toombs or Mr. Cobb for President has no foundation in fact. My\r\n    opinion is, that no man could have obtained a single vote in the\r\n    Mississippi delegation against Mr. Davis, who was then, as he is\r\n    now, the most eminent and popular of all the citizens of\r\n    Mississippi.... Very respectfully,\"\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"J. A. P. Campbell.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Hon. Duncan F. Kenner, of Louisiana:\r\n\r\n    \"....My recollections of what transpired at the time are very\r\n    vivid and positive....\r\n\r\n    \"Who should be President, was the absorbing question of the day.\r\n    It engaged the attention of all present, and elicited many\r\n    letters from our respective constituencies. The general\r\n    inclination was strongly in favor of Mr. Davis. In fact, no\r\n    other name was so prominently or so generally mentioned. The\r\n    name of Mr. Rhett, of South Carolina, was probably more\r\n    frequently mentioned than that of any other person, next to Mr.\r\n    Davis.\r\n\r\n    \"The rule adopted at our election was that each State should\r\n    have one vote, to be delivered in open session, _viva voce_, by\r\n    one of the delegates as spokesman for his colleagues. The\r\n    delegates of the different States met in secret session to\r\n    select their candidate and spokesman.\r\n\r\n    \"Of what occurred in these various meetings I can not speak\r\n    authoritatively as to other States, as their proceedings were\r\n    considered secret. I can speak positively, however, of what took\r\n    place at a meeting of the delegates from Louisiana. We, the\r\n    Louisiana delegates, without hesitation, and unanimously, after\r\n    a very short session, decided in favor of Mr. Davis. No other\r\n    name was mentioned; the claims of no one else were considered,\r\n    or even alluded to. There was not the slightest opposition to\r\n    Mr. Davis on the part of any of our delegation; certainly none\r\n    was expressed; all appeared enthusiastic in his favor, and, I\r\n    have no reason to doubt, felt so. Nor was the feeling induced by\r\n    any solicitation on the part of Mr. Davis or his friends. Mr.\r\n    Davis was not in or near Montgomery at the time. He was never\r\n    heard from on this subject, so far as I knew. He was never\r\n    announced as a candidate. We were seeking the best man to fill\r\n    the position, and the conviction at the time, in the minds of a\r\n    large majority of the delegates, that Mr. Davis was the best\r\n    qualified, from both his civil and military knowledge and\r\n    experience, induced many to look upon Mr. Davis as the best\r\n    selection that could be made.\r\n\r\n    \"This conviction, coupled with his well-recognized conservative\r\n    views--for in no sense did we consider Mr. Davis extreme, either\r\n    in his views or purposes--was the deciding consideration which\r\n    controlled the votes of the Louisiana delegation. Of this I have\r\n    not the least doubt. I remain, respectfully, very truly yours,\r\n    etc.\"\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"Duncan F. Kenner.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Hon. James Chesnut, of South Carolina:\r\n\r\n    \".... Before leaving home I had made up my mind as to who was\r\n    the fittest man to be President, and who to be Vice-President;\r\n    Mr. Davis for the first, and Mr. Stephens for the second. And\r\n    this was known to all my friends as well as to my colleagues.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Davis, then conspicuous for ability, had long experience in\r\n    civil service, was reputed a most successful organizer and\r\n    administrator of the military department of the United States\r\n    when he was Secretary of War, and came out of the Mexican war\r\n    with much _éclat_ as a soldier. Possessing a combination of\r\n    these high and needful qualities, he was regarded by nearly the\r\n    whole South as the fittest man for the position. I certainly so\r\n    regarded him, and did not change my mind on the way to\r\n    Montgomery....\r\n\r\n    \"Georgia was a great State--great in numbers, comparatively\r\n    great in wealth, and great in the intellectual gifts and\r\n    experiences of many of her sons. Conspicuous among them were\r\n    Stephens, Toombs, and Cobb. In view of these facts, it was\r\n    thought by all of us expedient--nay, more, positively right and\r\n    just--that Georgia should have a corresponding weight in the\r\n    counsels and conduct of the new Government.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Stephens was also a man of conceded ability, of high\r\n    character, conservative, devoted to the rights of the States,\r\n    and known to be a power in his own State; hence all eyes turned\r\n    to him to fill the second place.\r\n\r\n    \"Howell Cobb became President of the Convention, and General\r\n    Toombs Secretary of State. These two gifted Georgians were\r\n    called to these respective positions because of their\r\n    experience, ability, and ardent patriotism....\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Rhett was a very bold and frank man. So was Colonel Keitt;\r\n    and they, as always, avowed their opinions and acted upon them\r\n    with energy. Nevertheless, the vote of the delegation was cast\r\n    for Mr. Davis....\"\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"James Chesnut.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Hon. W. Porcher Miles, of Virginia, formerly of South Carolina,\r\nand a member of the Provisional Congress of 1861:\r\n\r\n    \"Oak Ridge, _January 27, 1880_.\r\n\r\n    \"....To the best of my recollection there was entire unanimity\r\n    in the South Carolina delegation at Montgomery on the subject of\r\n    the choice of a President. I think it very likely that Keitt,\r\n    from his warm personal friendship for Mr. Toombs, may at first\r\n    have preferred him. I have no recollections of Chesnut's\r\n    predilections. I think there was no question that Mr. Davis was\r\n    the choice of our delegation and of the whole people of South\r\n    Carolina.... I do not think Mr. Rhett ever attempted to\r\n    influence the course of his colleagues, either in this or in\r\n    matters generally before the Congress. Nor do I think his\r\n    personal influence in the delegation was as great as that of\r\n    some other members of it. If I were to select any one as having\r\n    a special influence with us, I would consider Mr. Robert\r\n    Barnwell as the one. His singularly pure and elevated character,\r\n    entire freedom from all personal ambition or desire for place or\r\n    position (he declined Mr. Davis's offer of a seat in the\r\n    Cabinet), as well as his long experience in public life and\r\n    admirably calm and well-balanced mind, all combined to make his\r\n    influence with his colleagues very great. But neither could he\r\n    be said 'to lead' the delegation. He had no desire, and never\r\n    made any attempt to do so. I think there was no delegation in\r\n    the Congress, the individual members of which were more\r\n    independent in coming to their own conclusions of what was right\r\n    and expedient to be done. There was always the frankest and\r\n    freest interchange of opinions among them, but every one\r\n    determined his own course for himself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: See Appendix K.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n    The Confederate Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter being inaugurated, I proceeded to the formation of my Cabinet,\r\nthat is, the heads of the executive departments authorized by the laws\r\nof the Provisional Congress. The unanimity existing among our people\r\nmade this a much easier and more agreeable task than where the rivalries\r\nin the party of an executive have to be consulted and accommodated,\r\noften at the expense of the highest capacity and fitness. Unencumbered\r\nby any other consideration than the public welfare, having no friends to\r\nreward or enemies to punish, it resulted that not one of those who\r\nformed my first Cabinet had borne to me the relation of close personal\r\nfriendship, or had political claims upon me; indeed, with two of them I\r\nhad no previous acquaintance.\r\n\r\nIt was my wish that the Hon. Robert W. Barnwell, of South Carolina,\r\nshould be Secretary of State. I had known him intimately during a trying\r\nperiod of our joint service in the United States Senate, and he had won\r\nalike my esteem and regard. Before making known to him my wish in this\r\nconnection, the delegation of South Carolina, of which he was a member,\r\nhad resolved to recommend one of their number to be Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and Mr. Barnwell, with characteristic delicacy, declined to\r\naccept my offer to him.\r\n\r\nI had intended to offer the Treasury Department to Mr. Toombs, of\r\nGeorgia, whose knowledge on subjects of finance had particularly\r\nattracted my notice when we served together in the United States Senate.\r\nMr. Barnwell having declined the State Department, and a colleague of\r\nhis, said to be peculiarly qualified for the Treasury Department, having\r\nbeen recommended for it, Mr. Toombs was offered the State Department,\r\nfor which others believed him to be well qualified.\r\n\r\nMr. Mallory, of Florida, had been chairman of the Committee on Naval\r\nAffairs in the United States Senate, was extensively acquainted with the\r\nofficers of the navy, and for a landsman had much knowledge of nautical\r\naffairs; therefore he was selected for Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nMr. Benjamin, of Louisiana, had a very high reputation as a lawyer, and\r\nmy acquaintance with him in the Senate had impressed me with the\r\nlucidity of his intellect, his systematic habits and capacity for labor.\r\nHe was therefore invited to the post of Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nMr. Reagan, of Texas, I had known for a sturdy, honest Representative in\r\nthe United States Congress, and his acquaintance with the territory\r\nincluded in the Confederate States was both extensive and accurate.\r\nThese, together with his industry and ability to labor, indicated him as\r\npeculiarly fit for the office of Postmaster-General.\r\n\r\nMr. Memminger, of South Carolina, had a high reputation for knowledge of\r\nfinance. He bore an unimpeachable character for integrity and close\r\nattention to duties, and, on the recommendation of the delegation from\r\nSouth Carolina, he was appointed Secretary of the Treasury, and proved\r\nhimself entirely worthy of the trust.\r\n\r\nMr. Walker, of Alabama, was a distinguished member of the bar of north\r\nAlabama, and was eminent among the politicians of that section. He was\r\nearnestly recommended by gentlemen intimately and favorably known to me,\r\nand was therefore selected for the War Department. His was the only name\r\npresented from Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe executive departments having been organized, my attention was first\r\ndirected to preparation for military defense, for, though I, in common\r\nwith others, desired to have a peaceful separation, and sent\r\ncommissioners to the United States Government to effect, if possible,\r\nnegotiations to that end, I did not hold the common opinion that we\r\nwould be allowed to depart in peace, and therefore regarded it as an\r\nimperative duty to make all possible preparation for the contingency of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n    Early Acts of the Confederate Congress.--Laws of the United\r\n    States continued in Force.--Officers of Customs and Revenue\r\n    continued in Office.--Commission to the United\r\n    States.--Navigation of the Mississippi.--Restrictions on the\r\n    Coasting-Trade removed.--Appointment of Commissioners to\r\n    Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe legislation of the Confederate Congress furnishes the best evidence\r\nof the temper and spirit which prevailed in the organization of the\r\nConfederate Government. The very first enactment, made on the 9th of\r\nFebruary, 1861--the day after the adoption of the Provisional\r\nConstitution--was this:\r\n\r\n    \"That all the laws of the United States of America in force and\r\n    in use in the Confederate States of America on the first day of\r\n    November last, and not inconsistent with the Constitution of the\r\n    Confederate States, be and the same are hereby continued in\r\n    force until altered or repealed by the Congress.\"[124]\r\n\r\nThe next act, adopted on the 14th of February, was one continuing in\r\noffice until the 1st of April next ensuing all officers connected with\r\nthe collection of customs and the assistant treasurers intrusted with\r\nthe keeping of the moneys arising therefrom, who were engaged in the\r\nperformance of such duties within any of the Confederate States, with\r\nthe same powers and functions which they had been exercising under the\r\nGovernment of the United States.[125]\r\n\r\nThe Provisional Constitution itself, in the second section of its sixth\r\narticle, had ordained as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"The Government hereby instituted shall take immediate steps for\r\n    the settlement of all matters between the States forming it and\r\n    their other late confederates of the United States, in relation\r\n    to the public property and public debt at the time of their\r\n    withdrawal from them; these States hereby declaring it to be\r\n    their wish and earnest desire to adjust everything pertaining to\r\n    the common property, common liabilities, and common obligations\r\n    of that Union, upon the principles of right, justice, equity,\r\n    and good faith.\"[126]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this requirement of the Constitution, the Congress,\r\non the 15th of February--before my arrival at Montgomery--passed a\r\nresolution declaring \"that it is the sense of this Congress that a\r\ncommission of three persons be appointed by the President-elect, as\r\nearly as may be convenient after his inauguration, and sent to the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America, for the purpose of\r\nnegotiating friendly relations between that Government and the\r\nConfederate States of America, and for the settlement of all questions\r\nof disagreement between the two Governments, upon principles of right,\r\njustice, equity, and good faith.\"[127]\r\n\r\nPersistent and to a great extent successful efforts were made to inflame\r\nthe minds of the people of the Northwestern States by representing to\r\nthem that, in consequence of the separation of the States, they would\r\nlose the free navigation of the Mississippi River. At that early period\r\nin the life of the Confederacy, the intercourse between the North and\r\nSouth had been so little interrupted, that the agitators, whose vocation\r\nit was to deceive the masses of the people, could not, or should not,\r\nhave been ignorant that, as early as the 25th of February, 1861, an act\r\nwas passed by the Confederate Congress, and approved by the President,\r\n\"to declare and establish the free navigation of the Mississippi River.\"\r\nThat act began with the announcement that \"the peaceful navigation of\r\nthe Mississippi River is hereby declared free to the citizens of any of\r\nthe States upon its borders, or upon the borders of its navigable\r\ntributaries,\" and its provisions secure that freedom for \"all ships,\r\nboats, or vessels,\" with their cargoes, \"without any duty or hindrance,\r\nexcept light-money, pilotage, and other like charges.\"[128]\r\n\r\nBy an act approved on the 26th of February, all laws which forbade the\r\nemployment in the coasting-trade of vessels not enrolled or licensed,\r\nand all laws imposing discriminating duties on foreign vessels or goods\r\nimported in them, were repealed.[129] These acts and all other\r\nindications manifest the well-known wish of the people of the\r\nConfederacy to preserve the peace and encourage the most unrestricted\r\ncommerce with all nations, surely not least with their late associates,\r\nthe Northern States. Thus far, the hope that peace might be maintained\r\nwas predominant; perhaps, the wish was father to the thought that there\r\nwould be no war between the States lately united. Indeed, all the laws\r\nenacted during the first session of the Provisional Congress show how\r\nconsistent were the purposes and actions of its members with their\r\noriginal avowal of a desire peacefully to separate from those with whom\r\nthey could not live in tranquillity, albeit the Government had been\r\nestablished to promote the common welfare. Under this state of feeling\r\nthe Government of the Confederacy was instituted.\r\n\r\nMy own views and inclinations, as has already been fully shown, were in\r\nentire accord with the disposition manifested by the requirement of the\r\nProvisional Constitution and the resolution of the Congress above\r\nrecited, for the appointment of a commission to negotiate friendly\r\nrelations with the United States and an equitable and peaceable\r\nsettlement of all questions which would necessarily arise under the new\r\nrelations of the States toward one another. Next to the organization of\r\na Cabinet, that of such a commission was accordingly one of the very\r\nfirst objects of attention. Three discreet, well-informed, and\r\ndistinguished citizens were selected as said Commissioners, and\r\naccredited to the President of the Northern States, Mr. Lincoln, to the\r\nend that by negotiation all questions between the two Governments might\r\nbe so adjusted as to avoid war, and perpetuate the kind relations which\r\nhad been cemented by the common trials, sacrifices, and glories of the\r\npeople of all the States. If sectional hostility had been engendered by\r\ndissimilarity of institutions, and by a mistaken idea of moral\r\nresponsibilities, and by irreconcilable creeds--if the family could no\r\nlonger live and grow harmoniously together--by patriarchal teaching\r\nolder than Christianity, it might have been learned that it was better\r\nto part, to part peaceably, and to continue, from one to another, the\r\ngood offices of neighbors who by sacred memories were forbidden ever to\r\nbe foes. The nomination of the members of the commission was made on the\r\n25th of February--within a week after my inauguration--and confirmed by\r\nCongress on the same day. The Commissioners appointed were Messrs. A. B.\r\nRoman, of Louisiana; Martin J. Crawford, of Georgia; and John Forsyth,\r\nof Alabama. Mr. Roman was an honored citizen, and had been Governor of\r\nhis native State. Mr. Crawford had served with distinction in Congress\r\nfor several years. Mr. Forsyth was an influential journalist, and had\r\nbeen Minister to Mexico under appointment of Mr. Pierce near the close\r\nof his term, and continued so under that of Mr. Buchanan. These\r\ngentlemen, moreover, represented the three great parties which had\r\nineffectually opposed the sectionalism of the so-called \"Republicans.\"\r\nEx-Governor Roman had been a Whig in former years, and one of the\r\n\"Constitutional Union,\" or Bell-and-Everett, party in the canvass of\r\n1860. Mr. Crawford, as a State-rights Democrat, had supported Mr.\r\nBreckinridge; and Mr. Forsyth had been a zealous advocate of the claims\r\nof Mr. Douglas. The composition of the commission was therefore such as\r\nshould have conciliated the sympathy and coöperation of every element of\r\nconservatism with which they might have occasion to deal. Their\r\ncommissions authorized and empowered them, \"in the name of the\r\nConfederate States, to meet and confer with any person or persons duly\r\nauthorized by the Government of the United States, being furnished with\r\nlike power and authority, and with him or them to agree, treat, consult,\r\nand negotiate\" concerning all matters in which the parties were both\r\ninterested. No secret instructions were given them, for there was\r\nnothing to conceal. The objects of their mission were open and avowed,\r\nand its inception and conduct throughout were characterized by frankness\r\nand good faith. How this effort was received, how the Commissioners were\r\nkept waiting, and, while fair promises were held to the ear, how\r\nmilitary preparations were pushed forward for the unconstitutional,\r\ncriminal purpose of coercing States, let the shameful record of that\r\ntransaction attest.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: Statutes at Large, Provisional Government, Confederate\r\nStates of America, p. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: Statutes at Large, Provisional Government, Confederate\r\nStates of America, pp. 27, 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: See Provisional Constitution, Appendix K, _in loco_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: Statutes at Large, Provisional Government, Confederate\r\nStates of America, p. 92.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: Statutes at Large, Provisional Government, Confederate\r\nStates of America, pp. 36-38.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: Ibid., p. 38.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n    The Peace Conference.--Demand for \"a Little Bloodletting.\"--Plan\r\n    proposed by the Conference.--Its Contemptuous Reception and\r\n    Treatment in the United States Congress.--Failure of Last\r\n    Efforts at Reconciliation and Reunion.--Note.--Speech of General\r\n    Lane, of Oregon.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the events which have just been occupying our attention were\r\noccurring, the last conspicuous effort was made within the Union to stay\r\nthe tide of usurpation which was driving the Southern States into\r\nsecession. This effort was set on foot by Virginia, the General Assembly\r\nof which State, on the 19th of January, 1861, adopted a preamble and\r\nresolutions, deprecating disunion, and inviting all such States as were\r\nwilling to unite in an earnest endeavor to avert it by an adjustment of\r\nthe then existing controversies to appoint commissioners to meet in\r\nWashington, on the 4th of February, \"to consider, and, if practicable,\r\nagree upon some suitable adjustment.\" Ex-President John Tyler, and\r\nMessrs. William C. Rives, John W. Brockenbrugh, George W. Summers, and\r\nJames A. Seddon--five of the most distinguished citizens of the\r\nState--were appointed to represent Virginia in the proposed conference.\r\nIf they could agree with the Commissioners of other States upon any plan\r\nof settlement requiring amendments to the Federal Constitution, they\r\nwere instructed to communicate them to Congress, with a view to their\r\nsubmission to the several States for ratification.\r\n\r\nThe \"border States\" in general promptly acceded to this proposition of\r\nVirginia, and others followed, so that in the \"Peace Congress,\" or\r\nconference, which assembled, according to appointment, on the 4th, and\r\nadjourned on the 27th of February, twenty-one States were eventually\r\nrepresented, of which fourteen were Northern, or \"non-slaveholding,\" and\r\nseven slaveholding States. The six States which had already seceded were\r\nof course not of the number represented; nor were Texas and Arkansas,\r\nthe secession of which, although not consummated, was obviously\r\ninevitable. Three of the Northwestern States--Michigan, Wisconsin, and\r\nMinnesota--and the two Pacific States--Oregon and California--also held\r\naloof from the conference. In the case of these last two, distance and\r\nlack of time perhaps hindered action. With regard to the other three,\r\ntheir reasons for declining to participate in the movement were not\r\nofficially assigned, and are therefore only subjects for conjecture.\r\nSome remarkable revelations were afterward made, however, with regard to\r\nthe action of one of them. It appears, from correspondence read in the\r\nSenate on the 27th of February, that the two Senators from Michigan had\r\nat first opposed the participation of that State in the conference, on\r\nthe ground that it was, as one of them expressed it, \"a step toward\r\nobtaining that concession which the imperious slave power so insolently\r\ndemands.\"[130]--that is to say, in plain terms, they objected to it\r\nbecause it might lead to a compromise and pacification. Finding,\r\nhowever, that most of the other Northern States were represented--some\r\nof them by men of moderate and conciliatory temper--that writer had\r\nsubsequently changed his mind, and at a late period of the session of\r\nthe conference recommended the sending of delegations of \"true,\r\nunflinching men,\" who would be \"in favor of the Constitution as it\r\nis\"--that is, who would oppose any amendment proposed in the interests\r\nof harmony and pacification.\r\n\r\nThe other Senator exhibits a similar alarm at the prospect of compromise\r\nand a concurrent change of opinion. He urges the sending of\r\n\"stiff-backed\" men, to thwart the threatened success of the friends of\r\npeace, and concludes with an expression of the humane and patriotic\r\nsentiment that \"without a little bloodletting\" the Union would not be\r\n\"worth a rush.\"[131] With such unworthy levity did these leaders of\r\nsectional strife express their exultation in the prospect of the\r\nconflict, which was to drench the land with blood and enshroud thousands\r\nof homes in mourning!\r\n\r\nIt is needless to follow the course of the deliberations of the Peace\r\nConference. It included among its members many men of distinction and\r\neminent ability, and some of unquestionable patriotism, from every part\r\nof the Union. The venerable John Tyler presided, and took an active and\r\nardent interest in the efforts made to effect a settlement and avert the\r\nimpending disasters. A plan was finally agreed upon by a majority of the\r\nStates represented, for certain amendments to the Federal Constitution,\r\nwhich it was hoped might be acceptable to all parties and put an end to\r\nfurther contention. In its leading features this plan resembled that of\r\nMr. Crittenden, heretofore spoken of, which was still pending in the\r\nSenate, though with some variations, which were regarded as less\r\nfavorable to the South. It was reported immediately to both Houses of\r\nthe United States Congress. In the Senate, Mr. Crittenden promptly\r\nexpressed his willingness to accept it as a substitute for his own\r\nproposition, and eloquently urged its adoption. But the arrogance of a\r\nsectional majority inflated by recent triumph was too powerful to be\r\nallayed by the appeals of patriotism or the counsels of wisdom. The plan\r\nof the Peace Conference was treated by the majority with the\r\ncontemptuous indifference shown to every other movement for\r\nconciliation. Its mere consideration was objected to by the extreme\r\nradicals, and, although they failed in this, it was defeated on a vote,\r\nas were the Crittenden propositions.\r\n\r\nWith the failure of these efforts, which occurred on the eve of the\r\ninauguration of Mr. Lincoln, and the accession to power of a party\r\nfounded on a basis of sectional aggression, and now thoroughly committed\r\nto its prosecution and perpetuation, expired the last hopes of\r\nreconciliation and union.\r\n\r\nNote.--In the course of the debate in the Senate on these grave\r\npropositions, a manly and eloquent speech was made on the 2d of March,\r\n1861, by the Hon. Joseph Lane, a Senator from Oregon, who had been the\r\ncandidate of the Democratic State-rights party for the Vice-Presidency\r\nof the United States, in the canvass of 1860. Some passages of this\r\nspeech seem peculiarly appropriate for insertion here. General Lane was\r\nreplying to a speech of Mr. Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, afterward\r\nPresident of the United States:\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. President, the Senator from Tennessee complains of my\r\n    remarks on his speech. He complains of the tone and temper of\r\n    what I said. He complains that I replied at all, as I was a\r\n    Northern Senator. Mr. President, I am a citizen of this Union\r\n    and a Senator of the United States. My residence is in the\r\n    North, but I have never seen the day, and I never shall, when I\r\n    will refuse justice as readily to the South as to the North. I\r\n    know nothing but my country, the whole country, the\r\n    Constitution, and the equality of the States--the equal right of\r\n    every man in the common territory of the whole country; and by\r\n    that I shall stand.\r\n\r\n    \"The Senator complains that I replied at all, as I was a\r\n    Northern Senator, and a Democrat whom he had supported at the\r\n    last election for a high office. Now, I was, as I stated at the\r\n    time, surprised at the Senator's speech, because I understood it\r\n    to be for coercion, as I think it was understood by almost\r\n    everybody else, except, as we are now told, by the Senator\r\n    himself; and I still think it amounted to a coercion speech,\r\n    notwithstanding the soft and plausible phrases by which he\r\n    describes it--a speech for the execution of the laws and the\r\n    protection of the Federal property. Sir, if there is, as I\r\n    contend, the right of secession, then, whenever a State\r\n    exercises that right, this Government has no laws in that State\r\n    to execute, nor has it any property in any such State that can\r\n    be protected by the power of this Government. In attempting,\r\n    however, to substitute the smooth phrases 'executing the laws'\r\n    and 'protecting public property' for coercion, for civil war, we\r\n    have an important concession: that is, that this Government dare\r\n    not go before the people with a plain avowal of its real\r\n    purposes and of their consequences. No, sir; the policy is to\r\n    inveigle the people of the North into civil war, by masking the\r\n    design in smooth and ambiguous terms.\"--(\"Congressional Globe,\"\r\n    second session, Thirty-sixth Congress, p. 1347.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: See letter of Hon.

Down to the\r\nformation of the Confederate Government, the one was distinctly\r\nadmitted, the other still more distinctly disavowed and repudiated, by\r\nmany of the leaders of public opinion in the North of both\r\nparties--indeed, any purpose of direct coercion was disclaimed by nearly\r\nall. If presented at all, it was in the delusive and ambiguous guise of\r\n\"the execution of the laws\" and \"protection of the public property.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"New York Tribune\"--the leading organ of the party which triumphed\r\nin the election of 1860--had said, soon after the result of that\r\nelection was ascertained, with reference to secession: \"We hold, with\r\nJefferson, to the inalienable right of communities to alter or abolish\r\nforms of government that have become oppressive or injurious; and, if\r\nthe cotton States shall decide that they can do better out of the Union\r\nthan in it, we insist on letting them go in peace. The right to secede\r\nmay be a revolutionary right, _but it exists nevertheless_; and we do\r\nnot see how one party can have _a right to do what another party has a\r\nright to prevent_. We must ever resist the asserted right of any State\r\nto remain in the Union and nullify or defy the laws thereof: _to\r\nwithdraw from the Union is quite another matter_. And, whenever a\r\nconsiderable section of our Union shall deliberately resolve to go out,\r\n_we shall resist all coercive measures designed to keep her in. We hope\r\nnever to live in a republic whereof one section is pinned to the residue\r\nby bayonets_.\"[132]\r\n\r\nThe only liberty taken with this extract has been that of presenting\r\ncertain parts of it in italics. Nothing that has ever been said by the\r\nauthor of this work, in the foregoing chapters, on the floor of the\r\nSenate, or elsewhere, more distinctly asserted the right of secession.\r\nNothing that has been quoted from Hamilton, or Madison, or Marshall, or\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, more emphatically repudiates the claim of right to\r\nrestrain or coerce a State in the exercise of its free choice. Nothing\r\nthat has been said since the war which followed could furnish a more\r\nstriking condemnation of its origin, prosecution, purposes, and results.\r\nA comparison of the sentiments above quoted, with the subsequent career\r\nof the party, of which that journal was and long had been the recognized\r\norgan, would exhibit a striking incongruity and inconsistency.\r\n\r\nThe \"Tribune\" was far from being singular among its Northern\r\ncontemporaries in the entertainment of such views, as Mr. Greeley, its\r\nchief editor, has shown by many citations in his book, \"The American\r\nConflict.\" The Albany \"Argus,\" about the same time, said, in language\r\nwhich Mr. Greeley characterizes as \"clear and temperate\": \"We sympathize\r\nwith and justify the South as far as this: their rights have been\r\ninvaded to the extreme limit possible within the forms of the\r\nConstitution; and, beyond this limit, their feelings have been insulted\r\nand their interests and honor assailed by almost every possible form of\r\ndenunciation and invective; and, if we deemed it certain that the real\r\n_animus_ of the Republican party could be carried into the\r\nadministration of the Federal Government, and become the permanent\r\npolicy of the nation, we should think that all the instincts of\r\nself-preservation and of manhood rightfully impelled them to a resort to\r\nrevolution and a separation from the Union, and we would applaud them\r\nand wish them godspeed in the adoption of such a remedy.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, the same paper said, a day or two afterward: \"If South Carolina\r\nor any other State, through a convention of her people, shall formally\r\nseparate herself from the Union, probably both the present and the next\r\nExecutive will simply let her alone and _quietly allow all the functions\r\nof the Federal Government within her limits to be suspended. Any other\r\ncourse would be madness_; as it would at once enlist all the Southern\r\nStates in the controversy and plunge the whole country into a civil\r\nwar.... As a matter of policy and wisdom, therefore, independent of the\r\nquestion of right, we should deem resort to force most disastrous.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"New York Herald\"--a journal which claimed to be independent of all\r\nparty influences--about the same period said: \"Each State is organized\r\nas a complete government, holding the purse and wielding the sword,\r\npossessing the right to break the tie of the confederation as a nation\r\nmight break a treaty, and to repel coercion as a nation might repel\r\ninvasion.... Coercion, if it were possible, is out of the question.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of January, 1861--after six States had already seceded--a\r\ngreat meeting was held in the city of New York, to consider the perilous\r\ncondition of the country. At this meeting Mr. James S. Thayer, \"an\r\nold-line Whig,\" made a speech, which was received with great applause.\r\nThe following extracts from the published report of Mr. Thayer's speech\r\nwill show the character of the views which then commanded the cordial\r\napproval of that metropolitan audience:\r\n\r\n    \"We can at least, in an authoritative way and a practical\r\n    manner, arrive at the basis of a _peaceable separation_.\r\n    [Cheers.] We can at least by discussion enlighten, settle, and\r\n    concentrate the public sentiment in the State of New York upon\r\n    this question, and save it from that fearful current, which\r\n    circuitously but certainly sweeps madly on, through the narrow\r\n    gorge of 'the enforcement of the laws,' to the shoreless ocean\r\n    of civil war! [Cheers.] Against this, under all circumstances,\r\n    in every place and form, we must now and at all times oppose a\r\n    resolute and unfaltering resistance. The public mind will bear\r\n    the avowal, and let us make it--that, if a revolution of force\r\n    is to begin, _it shall be inaugurated at home_. And if the\r\n    incoming Administration shall attempt to carry out the line of\r\n    policy that has been foreshadowed, we announce that, when the\r\n    hand of Black Republicanism turns to blood-red, and seeks _from\r\n    the fragment of the Constitution to construct a scaffolding for\r\n    coercion--another name for execution_--we will reverse the order\r\n    of the French Revolution, and save the blood of the people by\r\n    making those who would inaugurate a reign of terror the first\r\n    victims of a national guillotine!\" [Enthusiastic applause.]\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n    \"It is announced that the Republican Administration will enforce\r\n    the laws against and in all the seceding States. A nice\r\n    discrimination must be exercised in the performance of this\r\n    duty. You remember the story of William Tell.... Let an arrow\r\n    winged by the Federal bow strike the heart of an American\r\n    citizen, and who can number the avenging darts that will cloud\r\n    the heavens in the conflict that will ensue? [Prolonged\r\n    applause.] What, then, is the duty of the State of New York?\r\n    What shall we say to our people when we come to meet this state\r\n    of facts? That the Union must be preserved? But, if that can not\r\n    be, what then? _Peaceable separation._ [Applause.] Painful and\r\n    humiliating as it is, let us temper it with all we can of love\r\n    and kindness, so that we may yet be left in a comparatively\r\n    prosperous condition, in friendly relations with another\r\n    Confederacy.\" [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nAt the same meeting ex-Governor Horatio Seymour asked the question--on\r\nwhich subsequent events have cast their own commentary--whether\r\n\"successful coercion by the North is less revolutionary than successful\r\nsecession by the South? Shall we prevent revolution [he added] by being\r\nforemost in over-throwing the principles of our Government, and all that\r\nmakes it valuable to our people and distinguishes it among the nations\r\nof the earth?\"\r\n\r\nThe venerable ex-Chancellor Walworth thus expressed himself:\r\n\r\n    \"It would be as brutal, in my opinion, to send men to butcher\r\n    our own brothers of the Southern States as it would be to\r\n    massacre them in the Northern States. We are told, however, that\r\n    it is our duty to, and we must, enforce the laws. But why--and\r\n    what laws are to be enforced? There were laws that were to be\r\n    enforced in the time of the American Revolution.... Did Lord\r\n    Chatham go for enforcing those laws? No, he gloried in defense\r\n    of the liberties of America. He made that memorable declaration\r\n    in the British Parliament, 'If I were an American citizen,\r\n    instead of being, as I am, an Englishman, I never would submit\r\n    to such laws--never, never, never!'\" [Prolonged applause.]\r\n\r\nOther distinguished speakers expressed themselves in similar\r\nterms--varying somewhat in their estimate of the propriety of the\r\nsecession of the Southern States, but all agreeing in emphatic and\r\nunqualified reprobation of the idea of coercion. A series of\r\nconciliatory resolutions was adopted, one of which declares that \"civil\r\nwar will not restore the Union, but will defeat for ever its\r\nreconstruction.\"\r\n\r\nAt a still later period--some time in the month of February--the \"Free\r\nPress,\" a leading paper in Detroit, had the following:\r\n\r\n    \"If there shall not be a change in the present seeming purpose\r\n    to yield to no accommodation of the national difficulties, and\r\n    if troops shall be raised in the North to march against the\r\n    people of the South, _a fire in the rear will be opened upon\r\n    such troops_, which will either stop their march altogether or\r\n    wonderfully accelerate it.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Union,\" of Bangor, Maine, spoke no less decidedly to the same\r\neffect:\r\n\r\n    \"The difficulties between the North and the South must be\r\n    compromised, or the separation of the States _shall be\r\n    peaceable_. If the Republican party refuse to go the full length\r\n    of the Crittenden amendment--_which is the very least the South\r\n    can or ought to take_--then, here in Maine, not a Democrat will\r\n    be found who will raise his arm against his brethren of the\r\n    South. From one end of the State to the other let the cry of the\r\n    Democracy be, Compromise or Peaceable Separation!\"\r\n\r\nThat these were not expressions of isolated or exceptional sentiment is\r\nevident from the fact that they were copied with approval by other\r\nNorthern journals.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, when delivering his inaugural address, on the 4th of March,\r\n1861, had not so far lost all respect for the consecrated traditions of\r\nthe founders of the Constitution and for the majesty of the principle of\r\nState sovereignty as openly to enunciate the claim of coercion. While\r\narguing against the right to secede, and asserting his intention \"to\r\nhold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the\r\nGovernment, and collect the duties and imposts,\" he says that, \"beyond\r\nwhat may be necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion, no\r\nusing of force against or among the people anywhere,\" and appends to\r\nthis declaration the following pledge:\r\n\r\n    \"Where hostility to the United States shall be so great as to\r\n    prevent competent resident citizens from holding the Federal\r\n    offices, there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers\r\n    among the people for that object. While the strict legal right\r\n    may exist of the Government to enforce the exercise of these\r\n    offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating, and so\r\n    nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better to forego for\r\n    the time the uses of such offices.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts will serve to show that the people of the South were not\r\nwithout grounds for cherishing the hope, to which they so fondly clung,\r\nthat the separation would, indeed, be as peaceable in fact as it was, on\r\ntheir part, in purpose; that the conservative and patriotic feeling\r\nstill existing in the North would control the elements of sectional\r\nhatred and bloodthirsty fanaticism; and that there would be really \"no\r\nwar.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here the ingenuous reader may very naturally ask, What became of all\r\nthis feeling? How was it that, in the course of a few weeks, it had\r\ndisappeared like a morning mist? Where was the host of men who had\r\ndeclared that an army marching to invade the Southern States should\r\nfirst pass over their dead bodies? No _new_ question had arisen--no\r\nchange in the attitude occupied by the seceding States--no cause for\r\ncontroversy not already existing when these utterances were made. And\r\nyet the sentiments which they expressed were so entirely swept away by\r\nthe tide of reckless fury which soon afterward impelled an armed\r\ninvasion of the South, that (with a few praiseworthy but powerless\r\nexceptions) scarcely a vestige of them was left. Not only were they\r\nobliterated, but seemingly forgotten.\r\n\r\nI leave to others to offer, if they can, an explanation of this strange\r\nphenomenon. To the student of human nature, however, it may not seem\r\naltogether without precedent, when he remembers certain other instances\r\non record of mutations in public sentiment equally sudden and\r\nextraordinary. Ten thousand swords that would have leaped from their\r\nscabbards--as the English statesman thought--to avenge even a look of\r\ninsult to a lovely queen, hung idly in their places when she was led to\r\nthe scaffold in the midst of the vilest taunts and execrations. The case\r\nthat we have been considering was, perhaps, only an illustration of the\r\ngeneral truth that, in times of revolutionary excitement, the higher and\r\nbetter elements are crushed and silenced by the lower and baser--not so\r\nmuch on account of their greater extent, as of their greater violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: \"New York Tribune\" of November 9, 1860, quoted in \"The\r\nAmerican Conflict,\" vol. i, chap. xxiii, p. 359.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n    Temper of the Southern People indicated by the Action of the\r\n    Confederate Congress.--The Permanent Constitution.--Modeled\r\n    after the Federal Constitution.--Variations and Special\r\n    Provisions.--Provisions with Regard to Slavery and the\r\n    Slave-Trade.--A False Assertion refuted.--Excellence of the\r\n    Constitution.--Admissions of Hostile or Impartial Criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conservative temper of the people of the Confederate States was\r\nconspicuously exhibited in the most important product of the early\r\nlabors of their representatives in Congress assembled. The Provisional\r\nConstitution, although prepared only for temporary use, and necessarily\r\nin some haste, was so well adapted for the purposes which it was\r\nintended to serve, that many thought it would have been wise to continue\r\nit in force indefinitely, or at least until the independency of the\r\nConfederacy should be assured. The Congress, however, deeming it best\r\nthat the system of Government should emanate from the people,\r\naccordingly, on the 11th of March, prepared the permanent Constitution,\r\nwhich was submitted to and ratified by the people of the respective\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nOf this Constitution--which may be found in an appendix,[133] side by\r\nside with the Constitution of the United States--the Hon. Alexander H.\r\nStephens, who was one of its authors, very properly says:\r\n\r\n    \"The whole document utterly negatives the idea, which so many\r\n    have been active in endeavoring to put in the enduring form of\r\n    history, that the Convention at Montgomery was nothing but a set\r\n    of 'conspirators,' whose object was the overthrow of the\r\n    principles of the Constitution of the United States, and the\r\n    erection of a great 'slavery oligarchy,' instead of the free\r\n    institutions thereby secured and guaranteed. This work of the\r\n    Montgomery Convention, with that of the Constitution for a\r\n    Provisional Government, will ever remain, not only as a monument\r\n    of the wisdom, forecast, and statesmanship of the men who\r\n    constituted it, but an everlasting refutation of the charges\r\n    which have been brought against them. These works together show\r\n    clearly that their only leading object was to sustain, uphold,\r\n    and perpetuate the fundamental principles of the Constitution of\r\n    the United States.\"[134]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States was the model followed throughout,\r\nwith only such changes as experience suggested for better practical\r\nworking or for greater perspicuity. The preamble to both instruments is\r\nthe same in substance, and very nearly identical in language. The words\r\n\"We, the people of the United States,\" in one, are replaced by \"We, the\r\npeople of the Confederate States,\" in the other; and the gross\r\nperversion which has been made of the former expression is precluded in\r\nthe latter merely by the addition of the explanatory clause, \"each State\r\nacting in its sovereign and independent character\"--an explanation\r\nwhich, at the time of the formation of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, would have been deemed entirely superfluous.\r\n\r\nThe official term of the President was fixed at six instead of four\r\nyears, and it was provided that he should not be eligible for\r\nreëlection. This was in accordance with the original draft of the\r\nConstitution of 1787.[135]\r\n\r\nThe President was empowered to remove officers of his Cabinet, or those\r\nengaged in the diplomatic service, at his discretion, but in all other\r\ncases removal from office could be made only for cause, and the cause\r\nwas to be reported to the Senate.[136]\r\n\r\nCongress was authorized to provide by law for the admission of \"the\r\nprincipal officer in each of the executive departments\" (or Cabinet\r\nofficers) to a seat upon the floor of either House, with the privilege\r\nof taking part in the discussion of subjects pertaining to his\r\ndepartment.[137] This wise and judicious provision, which would have\r\ntended to obviate much delay and misunderstanding, was, however, never\r\nput into execution by the necessary legislation.\r\n\r\nProtective duties for the benefit of special branches of industry, which\r\nhad been so fruitful a source of trouble under the Government of the\r\nUnited States, were altogether prohibited.[138] So, also, were bounties\r\nfrom the Treasury,[139] and extra compensation for services rendered by\r\nofficers, contractors, or employees, of any description.[140]\r\n\r\nA vote of two thirds of each House was requisite for the appropriation\r\nof money from the Treasury, unless asked for by the chief of a\r\ndepartment and submitted to Congress by the President, or for payment of\r\nthe expenses of Congress, or of claims against the Confederacy\r\njudicially established and declared.[141] The President was also\r\nauthorized to approve any one appropriation and disapprove any other in\r\nthe same bill.[142]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the impeachment of Federal officers, it was intrusted, as\r\nformerly, to the discretion of the House of Representatives, with the\r\nadditional provision, however, that, in the case of any judicial or\r\nother officer exercising his functions solely within the limits of a\r\nparticular State, impeachment might be made by the Legislature of such\r\nState--the trial in all cases to be by the Senate of the Confederate\r\nStates.[143]\r\n\r\nAny two or more States were authorized to enter into compacts with each\r\nother for the improvement of the navigation of rivers flowing between or\r\nthrough them.[144] A vote of two thirds of each House--the Senate voting\r\nby States--was required for the admission of a new State.[145]\r\n\r\nWith regard to amendments of the Constitution, it was made obligatory\r\nupon Congress, on the demand of any three States, concurring in the\r\nproposed amendment or amendments, to summon a convention of all the\r\nStates to consider and act upon them, voting by States, but restricted\r\nin its action to the particular propositions thus submitted. If approved\r\nby such convention, the amendments were to be subject to final\r\nratification by two thirds of the States.[146]\r\n\r\nOther changes or modifications, worthy of special notice, related to\r\ninternal improvements, bankruptcy laws, duties on exports, suits in the\r\nFederal courts, and the government of the Territories.[147]\r\n\r\nWith regard to slavery and the slave-trade, the provisions of this\r\nConstitution furnish an effectual answer to the assertion, so often\r\nmade, that the Confederacy was founded on slavery, that slavery was its\r\n\"corner-stone,\" etc. Property in slaves, _already existing_, was\r\nrecognized and guaranteed, just as it was by the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States; and the rights of such property in the common Territories\r\nwere protected against any such hostile discrimination as had been\r\nattempted in the Union. But the \"extension of slavery,\" in the only\r\npractical sense of that phrase, was more distinctly and effectually\r\nprecluded by the Confederate than by the Federal Constitution. This will\r\nbe manifest on a comparison of the provisions of the two relative to the\r\nslave-trade. These are found at the beginning of the ninth section of\r\nthe first article of each instrument. The Constitution of the United\r\nStates has the following:\r\n\r\n    \"The migration or importation of such persons as any of the\r\n    States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be\r\n    prohibited by the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight\r\n    hundred and eight; but a tax or duty may be imposed on such\r\n    importations, not exceeding ten dollars for each person.\"\r\n\r\nThe Confederate Constitution, on the other hand, ordained as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"1. The importation of negroes of the African race from any\r\n    foreign country, other than the slaveholding States or\r\n    Territories of the United States of America, is hereby\r\n    forbidden; and Congress is required to pass such laws as shall\r\n    effectually prevent the same.\r\n\r\n    \"2. Congress shall also have the power to prohibit the\r\n    introduction of slaves from any state not a member of, or\r\n    Territory not belonging to, this Confederacy.\"\r\n\r\nIn the case of the United States, the only prohibition is against any\r\ninterference by Congress with the slave-trade for a term of years, and\r\nit was further legitimized by the authority given to impose a duty upon\r\nit. The term of years, it is true, had long since expired, but there was\r\nstill no prohibition of the trade by the Constitution; it was after 1808\r\nentirely within the discretion of Congress either to encourage,\r\ntolerate, or prohibit it.\r\n\r\nUnder the Confederate Constitution, on the contrary, the African\r\nslave-trade was \"_hereby forbidden_,\" positively and unconditionally,\r\nfrom the beginning. Neither the Confederate Government nor that of any\r\nof the States could permit it, and the Congress was expressly \"required\"\r\nto enforce the prohibition. The only discretion in the matter intrusted\r\nto the Congress was, whether or not to permit the introduction of slaves\r\nfrom any of the United States or their Territories.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, in his inaugural address, had said: \"I have no purpose,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in\r\nthe States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so,\r\nand I have no inclination to do so.\" Now, if there was no purpose on the\r\npart of the Government of the United States to interfere with the\r\ninstitution of slavery within its already existing limits--a proposition\r\nwhich permitted its propagation within those limits by natural\r\nincrease--and inasmuch as the Confederate Constitution precluded any\r\nother than the same natural increase, we may plainly perceive the\r\ndisingenuousness and absurdity of the pretension by which a factitious\r\nsympathy has been obtained in certain quarters for the war upon the\r\nSouth, on the ground that it was a war in behalf of freedom against\r\nslavery.[148] I had no direct part in the preparation of the Confederate\r\nConstitution. No consideration of delicacy forbids me, therefore, to\r\nsay, in closing this brief review of that instrument, that it was a\r\nmodel of wise, temperate, and liberal statesmanship. Intelligent\r\ncriticism, from hostile as well as friendly sources, has been compelled\r\nto admit its excellences, and has sustained the judgment of a popular\r\nNorthern journal which said, a few days after it was adopted and\r\npublished:\r\n\r\n    \"The new Constitution is the Constitution of the United States\r\n    with various modifications and some very important and most\r\n    desirable improvements. We are free to say that the invaluable\r\n    reforms enumerated should be adopted by the United States, with\r\n    or without a reunion of the seceded States, and as soon as\r\n    possible. But why not accept them with the propositions of the\r\n    Confederate States on slavery as a basis of reunion?\"[149]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: See Appendix K.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: \"War between the States,\" vol. ii, col. xix, p. 389.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: See Article II, section 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: Ibid., section 2, ¶ 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: Article I, section 6, ¶ 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: Article I, section 8, ¶ 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: Ibid., section 9, ¶ 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: Ibid., ¶ 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: Ibid., section 7, ¶ 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: Ibid., section 2, ¶ 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: Ibid., section 10, ¶ 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: Article IV, section 3, ¶ 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: Article V.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: Article I, section 8, ¶¶ 1 and 4, section 9, ¶ 6; Article\r\nIII, section 2, ¶ 1; Article IV, section 3, ¶ 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: As late as the 22d of April, 1861, Mr. Seward, United\r\nStates Secretary of State, in a dispatch to Mr. Dayton, Minister to\r\nFrance, since made public, expressed the views and purposes of the\r\nUnited States Government in the premises as follows. It may be proper to\r\nexplain that, by what he is pleased to term \"the revolution,\" Mr. Seward\r\nmeans the withdrawal of the Southern States; and that the words\r\nitalicized are, perhaps, not so distinguished in the original. He says:\r\n\"The Territories will remain in all respects the same, whether the\r\nrevolution shall succeed or shall fail. _The condition of slavery in the\r\nseveral States will remain just the same, whether it succeed or fail._\r\nThere is not even a pretext for the complaint that the disaffected\r\nStates are to be conquered by the United States if the revolution fails;\r\nfor the rights of the States and _the condition of every being in them_\r\nwill remain subject to exactly the same laws and forms of\r\nadministration, whether the revolution shall succeed or whether it shall\r\nfail. In the one case, the States would be federally connected with the\r\nnew Confederacy; in the other, they would, as now, be members of the\r\nUnited States; _but their Constitutions and laws, customs, habits, and\r\ninstitutions, in either ease, will remain the same_.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: \"New York Herald,\" March 19, 1861.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n    The Commission to Washington City.--Arrival of Mr.\r\n    Crawford.--Mr. Buchanan's Alarm.--Note of the Commissioners to\r\n    the New Administration.--Mediation of Justices Nelson and\r\n    Campbell.--The Difficulty about Forts Sumter and Pickens.--Mr.\r\n    Secretary Seward's Assurances.--Duplicity of the Government at\r\n    Washington.--Mr. Fox's Visit to Charleston.--Secret Preparations\r\n    for Coercive Measures.--Visit of Mr. Lamon.--Renewed Assurances\r\n    of Good Faith.--Notification to Governor Pickens.--Developments\r\n    of Secret History.--Systematic and Complicated Perfidy exposed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Commissioners to proceed to Washington, for the\r\npurpose of establishing friendly relations with the United States and\r\neffecting an equitable settlement of all questions relating to the\r\ncommon property of the States and the public debt, has already been\r\nmentioned.

Hoping\r\n    that through his agency these may be accomplished, I avail\r\n    myself of this occasion to offer to you the assurance of my\r\n    distinguished consideration.\"\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Montgomery, _February 27, 1861_.\"\r\n\r\nIt may here be mentioned, in explanation of my desire that the\r\ncommission, or at least a part of it, should reach Washington before the\r\nclose of Mr. Buchanan's term, that I had received an intimation from\r\nhim, through a distinguished Senator of one of the border States,[150]\r\nthat he would be happy to receive a Commissioner or Commissioners from\r\nthe Confederate States, and would refer to the Senate any communication\r\nthat might be made through such a commission.\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford--now a Judge of the Supreme Court of Georgia, and the only\r\nsurviving member of the commission--in a manuscript account, which he\r\nhas kindly furnished, of his recollections of events connected with it,\r\nsays that, on arriving in Washington at the early hour of half-past four\r\no'clock in the morning, he was \"surprised to see Pennsylvania Avenue,\r\nfrom the old National to Willard's Hotel, crowded with men hurrying,\r\nsome toward the former, but most of the faces in the direction of the\r\nlatter, where the new President [Mr. Lincoln, President-elect], the\r\ngreat political almoner, for the time being, had taken up his lodgings.\r\nAt this point,\" continues Judge Crawford, \"the crowd swelled to\r\nastonishing numbers of expectant and hopeful men, awaiting an\r\nopportunity, either to see Mr. Lincoln himself, or to communicate with\r\nhim through some one who might be so fortunate as to have access to his\r\npresence.\"\r\n\r\nDescribing his reception in the Federal capital, Judge Crawford says:\r\n\r\n    \"The feverish and emotional condition of affairs soon made the\r\n    presence of the special Commissioner at Washington known\r\n    throughout the city. Congress was still, of course, in session;\r\n    Senators and members of the House of Representatives, excepting\r\n    those of the Confederate States, who had withdrawn, were in\r\n    their seats, and the manifestations of anxious care and gloomy\r\n    forebodings were plainly to be seen on all sides. This was not\r\n    confined to sections, but existed among the men of the North and\r\n    West as well as those of the South....\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Buchanan, the President, was in a state of most thorough\r\n    alarm, not only for his home at Wheatland, but for his personal\r\n    safety.[151] In the very few days which had elapsed between the\r\n    time of his promise to receive a Commissioner from the\r\n    Confederate States and the actual arrival of the Commissioner,\r\n    he had become so fearfully panic-stricken, that he declined\r\n    either to receive him or to send any message to the Senate\r\n    touching the subject-matter of his mission.\r\n\r\n    \"The Commissioner had been for several years in Congress before\r\n    the Administration of Mr. Buchanan, as well as during his\r\n    official term, and had always been in close political and social\r\n    relations with him; yet he was afraid of a public visit from\r\n    him. He said that he had only three days of official life left,\r\n    and could incur no further dangers or reproaches than those he\r\n    had already borne from the press and public speakers of the\r\n    North.\r\n\r\n    \"The intensity of the prevalent feeling increased as the vast\r\n    crowds, arriving by every train, added fresh material; and\r\n    hatred and hostility toward our new Government were manifested\r\n    in almost every conceivable manner.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of the Commissioners (Mr. Forsyth) having arrived in Washington\r\non the 12th of March--eight days after the inauguration of Mr.\r\nLincoln--the two Commissioners then present, Messrs. Forsyth and\r\nCrawford, addressed to Mr. Seward, Secretary of State, a note informing\r\nhim of their presence, stating the friendly and peaceful purposes of\r\ntheir mission, and requesting the appointment of a day, as early as\r\npossible, for the presentation to the President of the United States of\r\ntheir credentials and the objects which they had in view. This letter\r\nwill be found in the Appendix,[152] with other correspondence which\r\nensued, published soon after the events to which it relates. The\r\nattention of the reader is specially invited to these documents, but, as\r\nadditional revelations have been made since they were first published,\r\nit will be proper, in order to a full understanding of the transactions\r\nto which they refer, to give here a brief statement of the facts.\r\n\r\nNo _written_ answer to the note of the Commissioners was delivered to\r\nthem for twenty-seven days after it was written. The paper of Mr.\r\nSeward, in reply, without signature or address, dated March 15th,[153]\r\nwas \"filed,\" as he states, on that day, in the Department of State, but\r\na copy of it was not handed to the Commissioners until the 8th of April.\r\nBut an oral answer had been made to the note of the Commissioners at a\r\nmuch earlier date, for the significance of which it will be necessary to\r\nbear in mind the condition of affairs at Charleston and Pensacola.\r\n\r\nFort Sumter was still occupied by the garrison under command of Major\r\nAnderson, with no material change in the circumstances since the failure\r\nof the attempt made in January to reënforce it by means of the Star of\r\nthe West. This standing menace at the gates of the chief harbor of South\r\nCarolina had been tolerated by the government and people of that State,\r\nand afterward by the Confederate authorities, in the abiding hope that\r\nit would be removed without compelling a collision of forces. Fort\r\nPickens, on one side of the entrance to the harbor of Pensacola, was\r\nalso occupied by a garrison of United States troops, while the two forts\r\n(Barrancas and McRee) on the other side were in possession of the\r\nConfederates. Communication by sea was not entirely precluded, however,\r\nin the case of Fort Pickens; the garrison had been strengthened, and a\r\nfleet of Federal men-of-war was lying outside of the harbor. The\r\ncondition of affairs at these forts--especially at Fort Sumter--was a\r\nsubject of anxiety with the friends of peace, and the hope of settling\r\nby negotiation the questions involved in their occupation had been one\r\nof the most urgent motives for the prompt dispatch of the Commissioners\r\nto Washington.\r\n\r\nThe letter of the Commissioners to Mr. Seward was written, as we have\r\nseen, on the 12th of March. The oral message, above mentioned, was\r\nobtained and communicated to the Commissioners through the agency of two\r\nJudges of the Supreme Court of the United States--Justices Nelson, of\r\nNew York, and Campbell, of Alabama. On the 15th of March, according to\r\nthe statement of Judge Campbell,[154] Mr. Justice Nelson visited the\r\nSecretaries of State and of the Treasury and the Attorney-General\r\n(Messrs. Seward, Chase, and Bates), to dissuade them from undertaking to\r\nput in execution any policy of coercion. \"During the term of the Supreme\r\nCourt he had very carefully examined the laws of the United States to\r\nenable him to attain his conclusions, and from time to time he had\r\nconsulted the Chief Justice [Taney] upon the questions which his\r\nexamination had suggested. His conclusion was that, without very serious\r\nviolations of Constitution and statutes, coercion could not be\r\nsuccessfully effected by the executive department. I had made [continues\r\nJudge Campbell] a similar examination, and I concurred in his\r\nconclusions and opinions. As he was returning from his visit to the\r\nState Department, we casually met, and he informed me of what he had\r\ndone. He said he had spoken to these officers at large; that he was\r\nreceived with respect and listened to with attention by all, with\r\napprobation by the Attorney-General, and with great cordiality by the\r\nSecretary of State; that the Secretary had expressed gratification to\r\nfind so many impediments to the disturbance of peace, and only wished\r\nthere had been more. He stated that the Secretary told him there was a\r\npresent cause of embarrassment: that the Southern Commissioners had\r\ndemanded recognition, and a refusal would lead to irritation and\r\nexcitement in the Southern States, and would cause a counter-irritation\r\nand excitement in the Northern States, prejudicial to a peaceful\r\nadjustment. Justice Nelson suggested that I might be of service.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of the interview between these two distinguished gentlemen,\r\nwe are informed, was another visit, by both of them, to the State\r\nDepartment, for the purpose of urging Mr. Seward to reply to the\r\nCommissioners, and assure them of the desire of the United States\r\nGovernment for a friendly adjustment. Mr. Seward seems to have objected\r\nto an immediate recognition of the Commissioners, on the ground that the\r\nstate of public sentiment in the North would not sustain it, in\r\nconnection with the withdrawal of the troops from Fort Sumter, which had\r\nbeen determined on. \"The evacuation of Sumter,\" he said, \"is as much as\r\nthe Administration can bear.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Campbell adds: \"I concurred in the conclusion that the evacuation\r\nof Sumter involved responsibility, and stated that there could not be\r\ntoo much caution in the adoption of measures so as not to shock or to\r\nirritate the public sentiment, and that the evacuation of Sumter was\r\nsufficient for the present in that direction. I stated that I would see\r\nthe Commissioners, and I would write to Mr. Davis to that effect. I\r\nasked him what I should say as to Sumter and as to Pickens. _He\r\nauthorized me to say that, before that letter could reach him_ [Mr.\r\nDavis], _he would learn by telegraph that the order for the evacuation\r\nof Sumter had been made_. He said the condition of Pickens was\r\nsatisfactory, and there would be no change made there.\" The italics in\r\nthis extract are my own.\r\n\r\nThe letter in which this promise was communicated to me has been lost,\r\nbut it was given in substantially the terms above stated as authorized\r\nby Mr. Seward--that the order for the evacuation of the fort would be\r\nissued before the letter could reach me. The same assurance was given,\r\non the same day, to the Commissioners. Judge Campbell tells us that Mr.\r\nCrawford was slow to consent to refrain from pressing the demand for\r\nrecognition. \"It was only after some discussion and the expression of\r\nsome objections that he consented\" to do so. This consent was clearly\r\none part of a stipulation, of which the other part was the pledge that\r\nthe fort would be evacuated in the course of a few days. Mr. Crawford\r\nrequired the pledge of Mr. Seward to be reduced to writing, with Judge\r\nCampbell's personal assurance of its genuineness and accuracy.[155] This\r\nwritten statement was exhibited to Judge Nelson, before its delivery,\r\nand approved by him. The fact that the pledge had been given in his name\r\nand behalf was communicated to Mr. Seward the same evening by letter. He\r\nwas cognizant of, consenting to, and in great part the author of, the\r\nwhole transaction.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that not only the Commissioners in Washington, but\r\nthe Confederate Government at Montgomery also, were thus assured on the\r\nhighest authority--that of the Secretary of State of the United States,\r\nthe official organ of communication of the views and purposes of his\r\nGovernment--of the intention of that Government to order the evacuation\r\nof Fort Sumter within a few days from the 15th of March, and not to\r\ndisturb the existing _status_ at Fort Pickens. Moreover, this was not\r\nthe mere statement of a fact, but a _pledge_, given as the consideration\r\nof an appeal to the Confederate Government and its Commissioners to\r\nrefrain from embarrassing the Federal Administration by prosecuting any\r\nfurther claims at the same time. As such a pledge, it was accepted, and,\r\nwhile its fulfillment was quietly awaited, the Commissioners forbore to\r\nmake any further demand for reply to their note of the 12th of March.\r\n\r\nFive days having elapsed in this condition of affairs, the Commissioners\r\nin Washington telegraphed Brigadier-General Beauregard, commander of the\r\nConfederate forces at Charleston, inquiring whether the fort had been\r\nevacuated, or any action taken by Major Anderson indicating the\r\nprobability of an evacuation. Answer was made to this dispatch, that the\r\nfort had not been evacuated, that there were no indications of such a\r\npurpose, but that Major Anderson was still working on its defenses. This\r\ndispatch was taken to Mr. Seward by Judge Campbell. Two interviews\r\noccurred in relation to it, at both of which Judge Nelson was also\r\npresent. Of the result of these interviews, Judge Campbell states: \"The\r\nlast was full and satisfactory. The Secretary was buoyant and sanguine;\r\nhe spoke of his ability to carry through his policy with confidence. He\r\naccounted for the delay as accidental, and _not involving the integrity\r\nof his assurance that the evacuation would take place_, and that I\r\nshould know whenever any change was made in the resolution in reference\r\nto Sumter or to Pickens. I repeated this assurance in writing to Judge\r\nCrawford, _and informed Governor Seward in writing what I had\r\nsaid_.\"[156]\r\n\r\nIt would be incredible, but for the ample proofs which have since been\r\nbrought to light, that, during all this period of reiterated assurances\r\nof a purpose to withdraw the garrison from Fort Sumter, and of excuses\r\nfor delay on account of the difficulties which embarrassed it, the\r\nGovernment of the United States was assiduously engaged in devising\r\nmeans for furnishing supplies and reënforcements to the garrison, with\r\nthe view of retaining possession of the fort!\r\n\r\nMr. G. V. Fox, afterward Assistant Secretary of the United States Navy,\r\nhad proposed a plan for reënforcing and furnishing supplies to the\r\ngarrison of Fort Sumter in February, during the Administration of Mr.\r\nBuchanan. In a letter published in the newspapers since the war, he\r\ngives an account of the manner in which the proposition was renewed to\r\nthe new Administration and its reception by them, as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"On the 12th of March I received a telegram from\r\n    Postmaster-General Blair to come to Washington. I arrived there\r\n    on the 13th. Mr. Blair having been acquainted with the\r\n    proposition I presented to General Scott, under Mr. Buchanan's\r\n    Administration, sent for me to tender the same to Mr. Lincoln,\r\n    informing me that Lieutenant-General Scott had advised the\r\n    President that the fort could not be relieved, and must be given\r\n    up. Mr. Blair took me at once to the White House, and I\r\n    explained the plan to the President. Thence we adjourned to\r\n    Lieutenant-General Scott's office, where a renewed discussion of\r\n    the subject took place. The General informed the President that\r\n    my plan was practicable in February, but that the increased\r\n    number of batteries erected at the mouth of the harbor since\r\n    that time rendered it impossible in March.\r\n\r\n    \"Finding that there was great opposition to any attempt at\r\n    relieving Fort Sumter, and that Mr. Blair alone sustained the\r\n    President in his policy of refusing to yield, I judged that my\r\n    arguments in favor of the practicability of sending in supplies\r\n    would be strengthened by a visit to Charleston and the fort. The\r\n    President readily agreed to my visit, if the Secretary of War\r\n    and General Scott raised no objection.\r\n\r\n    \"Both these gentlemen consenting, I left Washington on the 19th\r\n    of March, and, passing through Richmond and Wilmington, reached\r\n    Charleston on the 21st.\"\r\n\r\nThus we see that, at the very moment when Mr. Secretary Seward was\r\nrenewing to the Confederate Government, through Judge Campbell, his\r\npositive assurance that \"the evacuation _would_ take place,\" this\r\nemissary was on his way to Charleston to obtain information and devise\r\nmeasures by means of which this promise might be broken.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in Charleston, Mr. Fox tells us that he sought an\r\ninterview with Captain Hartstein, of the Confederate Navy, and through\r\nthis officer obtained from Governor Pickens permission to visit Fort\r\nSumter. He fails, in his narrative, to state what we learn from Governor\r\nPickens himself,[157] that this permission was obtained \"expressly upon\r\nthe pledge of 'pacific purposes.'\" Notwithstanding this pledge, he\r\nemployed the opportunity afforded by his visit to mature the details of\r\nhis plan for furnishing supplies and reënforcements to the garrison. He\r\ndid not, he says, communicate his plan or purposes to Major Anderson,\r\nthe commanding officer of the garrison, having discernment enough,\r\nperhaps, to divine that the instincts of that brave and honest soldier\r\nwould have revolted at and rebuked the duplicity and perfidy of the\r\nwhole transaction. The result of his visit was, however, reported at\r\nWashington, his plan was approved by President Lincoln, and he was sent\r\nto New York to make arrangements for putting it in execution.\r\n\r\n    \"In a very few days after\" (says Governor Pickens, in the\r\n    message already quoted above), \"another confidential agent,\r\n    Colonel Lamon, was sent by the President [Mr. Lincoln], who\r\n    informed me that he had come to try and arrange for the removal\r\n    of the garrison, and, when he returned from the fort, asked if a\r\n    war-vessel could not be allowed to remove them. I replied that\r\n    no war-vessel could be allowed to enter the harbor on any terms.\r\n    He said he believed Major Anderson preferred an ordinary\r\n    steamer, and I agreed that the garrison might be thus removed.\r\n    He said he hoped to return in a very few days for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nThis, it will be remembered, occurred while Mr. Fox was making active,\r\nthough secret, preparations for his relief expedition.\r\n\r\nColonel, or Major, Lamon, as he is variously styled in the\r\ncorrespondence, did not return to Charleston, as promised. About the\r\n30th of March (which was Saturday) a telegram from Governor Pickens was\r\nreceived by the Commissioners in Washington, making inquiry with regard\r\nto Colonel Lamon, and the meaning of the protracted delay to fulfill the\r\npromise of evacuation. This was fifteen days after the original\r\nassurance of Mr. Seward that the garrison would be withdrawn\r\nimmediately, and ten days after his explanation that the delay was\r\n\"accidental.\" The dispatch of Governor Pickens was taken by Judge\r\nCampbell to Mr. Seward, who appointed the ensuing Monday (1st of April)\r\nfor an interview and answer. At that interview Mr. Seward informed Judge\r\nCampbell that \"the President was concerned about the contents of the\r\ntelegram--_there was a point of honor involved_; that Lamon had no\r\nagency from him, nor title to speak.\"[158] (This late suggestion of the\r\npoint of _honor_ would seem, under the circumstances, to have been made\r\nin a spirit of sarcastic pleasantry, like Sir John Falstaff's celebrated\r\ndiscourse on the same subject.) The only substantial result of the\r\nconversation, however, was the written assurance of Mr. Seward, to be\r\ncommunicated to the Commissioners, that \"the Government will not\r\nundertake to supply Fort Sumter without giving notice to Governor\r\nPickens.\"\r\n\r\nThis, it will be observed, was a very material variation from the\r\npositive pledge previously given, and reiterated, to the Commissioners,\r\nto Governor Pickens, and to myself directly, that the fort was to be\r\nforthwith evacuated. Judge Campbell, in his account of the interview,\r\nsays: \"I asked him [Mr. Seward] whether I was to understand that there\r\nhad been a change in his former communications. His answer was,\r\n'None.'\"[159]\r\n\r\nAbout the close of the same week (the first in April), the patience of\r\nthe Commissioners having now been wellnigh exhausted, and the hostile\r\npreparations of the Government of the United States, notwithstanding the\r\nsecrecy with which they were conducted, having become matter of general\r\nrumor, a letter was addressed to Mr. Seward, upon the subject, by Judge\r\nCampbell, in behalf of the Commissioners, again asking whether the\r\nassurances so often given were well or ill founded. To this the\r\nSecretary returned answer in writing: \"_Faith as to Sumter fully kept.\r\nWait and see._\"\r\n\r\nThis was on the 7th of April.[160] The very next day (the 8th) the\r\nfollowing official notification (without date or signature) was read to\r\nGovernor Pickens, of South Carolina, and General Beauregard, in\r\nCharleston, by Mr. Chew, an official of the _State Department_ (Mr.\r\nSeward's) in Washington, who said--as did a Captain or Lieutenant\r\nTalbot, who accompanied him--that it was from the President of the\r\nUnited States, and delivered by him to Mr. Chew on the 6th--the day\r\n_before_ Mr. Seward's assurance of \"_faith fully kept_.\"\r\n\r\n    \"I am directed by the President of the United States to notify\r\n    you to expect an attempt will be made to supply Fort Sumter with\r\n    provisions only; and that, if such an attempt be not resisted,\r\n    no effort to throw in men, arms, or ammunition, will be made,\r\n    without further notice, or in case of an attack upon the\r\n    fort.\"[161]\r\n\r\nThus disappeared the last vestige of the plighted faith and pacific\r\npledges of the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nIn order fully to appreciate the significance of this communication, and\r\nof the time and circumstances of its delivery, it must be borne in mind\r\nthat the naval expedition which had been secretly in preparation for\r\nsome time at New York, under direction of Captain Fox, was now ready to\r\nsail, and might reasonably be expected to be at Charleston almost\r\nimmediately after the notification was delivered to Governor Pickens,\r\nand before preparation could be made to receive it. Owing to\r\ncross-purposes or misunderstandings in the Washington Cabinet, however,\r\nand then to the delay caused by a severe storm at sea, this expectation\r\nwas disappointed, and the Confederate commander at Charleston had\r\nopportunity to communicate with Montgomery and receive instructions for\r\nhis guidance, before the arrival of the fleet, which had been intended\r\nto be a surprise.\r\n\r\nIn publications made since the war by members of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet,\r\nit has been represented that, during the period of the disgraceful\r\ntransactions above detailed, there were dissensions and divisions in the\r\nCabinet--certain members of it urging measures of prompt and decided\r\ncoercion; the Secretary of State favoring a pacific or at least a\r\ndilatory policy; and the President vacillating for a time between the\r\ntwo, but eventually adopting the views of the coercionists. In these\r\nstatements it is represented that the assurances and pledges, given by\r\nMr. Seward to the Confederate Government and its Commissioners, were\r\ngiven on his own authority, and without the consent or approval of the\r\nPresident of the United States. The absurdity of any such attempt to\r\ndisassociate the action of the President from that of his Secretary, and\r\nto relieve the former of responsibility for the conduct of the latter,\r\nis too evident to require argument or comment. It is impossible to\r\nbelieve that, during this whole period of nearly a month, Mr. Lincoln\r\nwas ignorant of the communications that were passing between the\r\nConfederate Commissioners and Mr. Seward, through the distinguished\r\nmember of the Supreme Court--still holding his seat as such--who was\r\nacting as intermediary. On one occasion, Judge Campbell informs us that\r\nthe Secretary, in the midst of an important interview, excused himself\r\nfor the purpose of conferring with the President before giving a final\r\nanswer, and left his visitor for some time, awaiting his return from\r\nthat conference, when the answer was given, avowedly and directly\r\nproceeding from the President.\r\n\r\nIf, however, it were possible to suppose that Mr. Seward was acting on\r\nhis own responsibility, and practicing a deception upon his own chief,\r\nas well as upon the Confederate authorities, in the pledges which he\r\nmade to the latter, it is nevertheless certain that the principal facts\r\nwere brought to light within a few days after the close of the efforts\r\nat negotiation. Yet the Secretary of State was not impeached and brought\r\nto trial for the grave offense of undertaking to conduct the most\r\nmomentous and vital transactions that had been or could be brought\r\nbefore the Government of the United States, without the knowledge and in\r\nopposition to the will of the President, and for having involved the\r\nGovernment in dishonor, if not in disaster. He was not even dismissed\r\nfrom office, but continued to be the chief officer of the Cabinet and\r\nconfidential adviser of the President, as he was afterward of the\r\nensuing Administration, occupying that station during two consecutive\r\nterms. No disavowal of his action, no apology nor explanation, was ever\r\nmade. Politically and legally, the President is unquestionably\r\nresponsible in all cases for the action of any member of his Cabinet,\r\nand in this case it is as preposterous to attempt to dissever from him\r\nthe moral, as it would be impossible to relieve him of the legal,\r\nresponsibility that rests upon the Government of the United States for\r\nthe systematic series of frauds perpetrated by its authority.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Mr. Seward, throughout the whole negotiation, was\r\nfully informed of the views of his colleagues in the Cabinet and of the\r\nPresident. Whatever his real hopes or purposes may have been in the\r\nbeginning, it is positively certain that long before the end, and while\r\nstill reiterating his assurances that the garrison would be withdrawn,\r\nhe knew that it had been _determined_, and that active preparations were\r\nin progress, to strengthen it.\r\n\r\nMr. Gideon Welles, who was Secretary of the Navy in Mr. Lincoln's\r\nCabinet, gives the following account of one of the transactions of the\r\nperiod:\r\n\r\n    \"One evening in the latter part of the month of March, there was\r\n    a small gathering at the Executive Mansion, while the Sumter\r\n    question was still pending. The members of the Cabinet were soon\r\n    individually and quietly invited to the council-chamber, where,\r\n    as soon as assembled, the President informed them he had just\r\n    been advised by General Scott that it was expedient to evacuate\r\n    Fort Pickens, as well as Fort Sumter, which last was assumed at\r\n    military headquarters to be a determined fact, in conformity\r\n    with the views of Secretary Seward and the General-in-Chief....\r\n\r\n    \"A brief silence followed the announcement of the amazing\r\n    recommendation of General Scott, when Mr. Blair, who had been\r\n    much annoyed by the vacillating course of the General-in-Chief\r\n    in regard to Sumter, remarked, looking earnestly at Mr. Seward,\r\n    that it was evident the old General was playing politician in\r\n    regard to both Sumter and Pickens; for it was not possible, if\r\n    there was a defense, for the rebels to take Pickens; and the\r\n    Administration would not be justified if it listened to his\r\n    advice and evacuated either. Very soon thereafter, I think at\r\n    the next Cabinet meeting, the President announced his decision\r\n    that _supplies should be sent to Sumter_, and issued\r\n    confidential orders to that effect. All were gratified with this\r\n    decision, except Mr. Seward, who still remonstrated, _but\r\n    preparations were immediately commenced to fit out an expedition\r\n    to forward supplies_.\"[162]\r\n\r\nThis account is confirmed by a letter of Mr. Montgomery Blair.[163] The\r\ndate of the announcement of the President's final purpose is fixed by\r\nMr. Welles, in the neat paragraph to that above quoted, as the 28th of\r\nMarch. This was four days before Mr. Seward's assurance given Judge\r\nCampbell--after conference with the President--that there would be no\r\ndeparture from the pledges previously given (which were that the fort\r\n_would be evacuated_), and ten days before his written renewal of the\r\nassurance--\"_Faith as to Sumter fully kept. Wait and see!_\" This\r\nassurance, too, was given at the very moment when a messenger from his\r\nown department was on the way to Charleston to notify the Governor of\r\nSouth Carolina that faith would _not_ be kept in the matter.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that the Commissioners had, with good\r\nreason, ceased to place any confidence in the promises of the United\r\nStates Government, before they ceased to be made. On the 8th of April\r\nthey sent the following dispatch to General Beauregard:\r\n\r\n    \"Washington, _April 8, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"General G. T. Beauregard: Accounts uncertain, because of the\r\n    constant vacillation of this Government. We were reassured\r\n    yesterday that the status of Sumter would not be changed without\r\n    previous notice to Governor Pickens, but we have no faith in\r\n    them. The war policy prevails in the Cabinet at this time.\r\n\r\n    \"M. J. Crawford.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day the announcement made to Governor Pickens through Mr.\r\nChew was made known. The Commissioners immediately applied for a\r\ndefinitive answer to their note of March 12th, which had been permitted\r\nto remain in abeyance. The paper of the Secretary of State, dated March\r\n15th, was thereupon delivered to them. This paper, with the final\r\nrejoinder of the Commissioners and Judge Campbell's letters to the\r\nSecretary of April 13th and April 20th, respectively, will be found in\r\nthe Appendix.\r\n\r\nNegotiation was now at an end, and the Commissioners withdrew from\r\nWashington and returned to their homes. Their last dispatch, before\r\nleaving, shows that they were still dependent upon public rumor and the\r\nnewspapers for information as to the real purposes and preparations of\r\nthe Federal Administration. It was in these words:\r\n\r\n    \"Washington, _April 10, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"General G. T. Beauregard: The 'Tribune' of to-day declares the\r\n    main object of the expedition to be the relief of Sumter, and\r\n    that a force will be landed which will overcome all opposition.\r\n\r\n    \"Roman, Crawford, and Forsyth.\"\r\n\r\nThe annexed extracts from my message to the Confederate Congress at the\r\nopening of its special session, on the 29th of April, will serve as a\r\nrecapitulation of the events above narrated, with all of comment that it\r\nwas then, or is now, considered necessary to add:\r\n\r\n    [_Extracts from President's Message to the Confederate Congress,\r\n    of April 29, 1861._]\r\n\r\n    \"... Scarce had you assembled in February last, when, prior even\r\n    to the inauguration of the Chief Magistrate you had elected, you\r\n    expressed your desire for the appointment of Commissioners, and\r\n    for the settlement of all questions of disagreement between the\r\n    two Governments upon principles of right, justice, equity, and\r\n    good faith.\r\n\r\n    \"It was my pleasure, as well as my duty, to coöperate with you\r\n    in this work of peace. Indeed, in my address to you, on taking\r\n    the oath of office, and before receiving from you the\r\n    communication of this resolution, I had said that, as a\r\n    necessity, not as a choice, we have resorted to the remedy of\r\n    separating, and henceforth our energies must be directed to the\r\n    conduct of our own affairs, and the perpetuity of the\r\n    Confederacy which we have formed. If a just perception of mutual\r\n    interest shall permit us to peaceably pursue our separate\r\n    political career, my most earnest desire will then have been\r\n    fulfilled.\r\n\r\n    \"It was in furtherance of these accordant views of the Congress\r\n    and the Executive, that I made choice of three discreet, able,\r\n    and distinguished citizens, who repaired to Washington. Aided by\r\n    their cordial coöperation and that of the Secretary of State,\r\n    every effort compatible with self-respect and the dignity of the\r\n    Confederacy was exhausted, before I allowed myself to yield to\r\n    the conviction that the Government of the United States was\r\n    determined to attempt the conquest of this people, and that our\r\n    cherished hopes of peace were unobtainable.\r\n\r\n    \"On the arrival of our Commissioners in Washington on the 5th of\r\n    March,[164] they postponed, at the suggestion of a friendly\r\n    intermediator, doing more than giving informal notice of their\r\n    arrival. This was done with a view to afford time to the\r\n    President of the United States, who had just been inaugurated,\r\n    for the discharge of other pressing official duties in the\r\n    organization of his Administration, before engaging his\r\n    attention to the object of their mission.\r\n\r\n    \"It was not until the 12th of the month that they officially\r\n    addressed the Secretary of State, informing him of the purpose\r\n    of their arrival, and stating in the language of their\r\n    instructions their wish to make to the Government of the United\r\n    States overtures for the opening of negotiations, assuring the\r\n    Government of the United States that the President, Congress,\r\n    and people of the Confederate States desired a peaceful solution\r\n    of these great questions; that it was neither their interest nor\r\n    their wish to make any demand which was not founded on the\r\n    strictest principles of justice, nor to do any act to injure\r\n    their late confederates.\r\n\r\n    \"To this communication, no formal reply was received until the\r\n    8th of April. During the interval, the Commissioners had\r\n    consented to waive all questions of form, with the firm resolve\r\n    to avoid war, if possible. They went so far even as to hold,\r\n    during that long period, unofficial intercourse through an\r\n    intermediary, whose high position and character inspired the\r\n    hope of success, and through whom constant assurances were\r\n    received from the Government of the United States of its\r\n    peaceful intentions--of its determination to evacuate Fort\r\n    Sumter; and, further, that no measure would be introduced\r\n    changing the existing status prejudicial to the Confederate\r\n    States; that, in the event of any change in regard to Fort\r\n    Pickens, notice would be given to the Commissioners.\r\n\r\n    \"The crooked path of diplomacy can scarcely furnish an example\r\n    so wanting in courtesy, in candor, and directness, as was the\r\n    course of the United States Government toward our Commissioners\r\n    in Washington. For proof of this, I refer to the annexed\r\n    documents marked, (?) taken in connection with further facts,\r\n    which I now proceed to relate.\r\n\r\n    \"Early in April the attention of the whole country was attracted\r\n    to extraordinary preparations, in New York and other Northern\r\n    ports, for an extensive military and naval expedition. These\r\n    preparations were commenced in secrecy for an expedition whose\r\n    destination was concealed, and only became known when nearly\r\n    completed; and on the 5th, 6th, and 7th of April, transports and\r\n    vessels of war, with troops, munitions, and military supplies,\r\n    sailed from Northern ports, bound southward.\r\n\r\n    \"Alarmed by so extraordinary a demonstration, the Commissioners\r\n    requested the delivery of an answer to their official\r\n    communication of the 12th of March, and the reply, dated on the\r\n    15th of the previous month, was obtained, from which it appears\r\n    that, during the whole interval, while the Commissioners were\r\n    receiving assurances calculated to inspire hope of the success\r\n    of their mission, the Secretary of State and the President of\r\n    the United States had already determined to hold no intercourse\r\n    with them whatever, to refuse even to listen to any proposals\r\n    they had to make; and had profited by the delay created by their\r\n    own assurances, in order to prepare secretly the means for\r\n    effective hostile operations.\r\n\r\n    \"That these assurances were given, has been virtually confessed\r\n    by the Government of the United States, by its act of sending a\r\n    messenger to Charleston to give notice of its purpose to use\r\n    force, if opposed in its intention of supplying Fort Sumter.\r\n\r\n    \"No more striking proof of the absence of good faith in the\r\n    conduct of the Government of the United States toward the\r\n    Confederacy can be required, than is contained in the\r\n    circumstances which accompanied this notice.\r\n\r\n    \"According to the usual course of navigation, the vessels\r\n    composing the expedition, and designed for the relief of Fort\r\n    Sumter, might be looked for in Charleston Harbor on the 9th of\r\n    April. Yet our Commissioners in Washington were detained under\r\n    assurances that notice should be given of any military movement.\r\n    The notice was not addressed to them, but a messenger was sent\r\n    to Charleston to give notice to the Governor of South Carolina,\r\n    and the notice was so given at a late hour on the 8th of April,\r\n    the eve of the very day on which the fleet might be expected to\r\n    arrive.\r\n\r\n    \"That this manoeuvre failed in its purpose was not the fault of\r\n    those who controlled it. A heavy tempest delayed the arrival of\r\n    the expedition, and gave time to the commander of our forces at\r\n    Charleston to ask and receive instructions of the Government.\"\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: Mr. Hunter, of Virginia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: This statement is in accord with a remark which Mr.\r\nBuchanan made to the author at an earlier period of the same session,\r\nwith regard to the violence of Northern sentiment then lately indicated,\r\nthat he thought it not impossible that his homeward route would be\r\nlighted by burning effigies of himself, and that on reaching his home he\r\nwould find it a heap of ashes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: See Appendix L.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: See letter of Judge Campbell to Colonel George W.

In the\r\nSenate of the United States, which continued in executive session for\r\nseveral weeks after the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln, it was the subject\r\nof discussion. Mr. Douglas, of Illinois--who was certainly not suspected\r\nof sympathy with secession, or lack of devotion to the Union--on the\r\n15th of March offered a resolution recommending the withdrawal of the\r\ngarrisons from all forts within the limits of the States which had\r\nseceded, except those at Key West and the Dry Tortugas. In support of\r\nthis resolution he said:\r\n\r\n    \"We certainly can not justify the holding of forts there, much\r\n    less the recapturing of those which have been taken, unless we\r\n    intend to reduce those States themselves into subjection. I take\r\n    it for granted, no man will deny the proposition, that whoever\r\n    permanently holds Charleston and South Carolina is entitled to\r\n    the possession of Fort Sumter. Whoever permanently holds\r\n    Pensacola and Florida is entitled to the possession of Fort\r\n    Pickens. Whoever holds the States in whose limits those forts\r\n    are placed is entitled to the forts themselves, unless there is\r\n    something peculiar in the location of some particular fort that\r\n    makes it important for us to hold it for the general defense of\r\n    the whole country, its commerce and interests, instead of being\r\n    useful only for the defense of a particular city or locality. It\r\n    is true that Forts Taylor and Jefferson, at Key West and\r\n    Tortugas, are so situated as to be essentially national, and\r\n    therefore important to us without reference to our relations\r\n    with the seceded States. Not so with Moultrie, Johnson, Castle\r\n    Pinckney, and Sumter, in Charleston Harbor; not so with Pulaski,\r\n    on the Savannah River; not so with Morgan and other forts in\r\n    Alabama; not so with those other forts that were intended to\r\n    guard the entrance of a particular harbor for local defense....\r\n\r\n    \"We can not deny that there is a Southern Confederacy, _de\r\n    facto_, in existence, with its capital at Montgomery. We may\r\n    regret it. _I_ regret it most profoundly; but I can not deny the\r\n    truth of the fact, painful and mortifying as it is.... I\r\n    proclaim boldly the policy of those with whom I act. We are for\r\n    peace.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Douglas, in urging the maintenance of _peace_ as a motive for the\r\nevacuation of the forts, was no doubt aware of the full force of his\r\nwords. He knew that their continued occupation was virtually a\r\ndeclaration of war.\r\n\r\nThe General-in-Chief of the United States Army, also, it is well known,\r\nurgently advised the evacuation of the forts. But the most striking\r\nprotest against the coercive measures finally adopted was that of Major\r\nAnderson himself. The letter in which his views were expressed has been\r\ncarefully suppressed in the partisan narratives of that period and\r\nwellnigh lost sight of, although it does the highest honor to his\r\npatriotism and integrity. It was written on the same day on which the\r\nannouncement was made to Governor Pickens of the purpose of the United\r\nStates Government to send supplies to the fort, and is worthy of\r\nreproduction here:[165]\r\n\r\n    [_Letter of Major Anderson, United States Army, protesting\r\n    against Fox's Plan for relieving Fort Sumter_.]\r\n\r\n    \"Fort Sumter, S. C., _April 8, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"_To Colonel L. Thomas, Adjutant-General United States Army_.\r\n\r\n    \"Colonel: I have the honor to report that the resumption of work\r\n    yesterday (Sunday) at various points on Morris Island, and the\r\n    vigorous prosecution of it this morning, apparently\r\n    strengthening all the batteries which are under the fire of our\r\n    guns, shows that they either have just received some news from\r\n    Washington which has put them on the _qui vive_, or that they\r\n    have received orders from Montgomery to commence operations\r\n    here. I am preparing, by the side of my barbette guns,\r\n    protection for our men from the shells which will be almost\r\n    continually bursting over or in our work.\r\n\r\n    \"I had the honor to receive, by yesterday's mail, the letter of\r\n    the Honorable Secretary of War, dated April 4th, and confess\r\n    that what he there states surprises me very greatly--following,\r\n    as it does, and contradicting so positively, the assurance Mr.\r\n    Crawford telegraphed he was 'authorized' to make. I trust that\r\n    this matter will be at once put in a correct light, as a\r\n    movement made now, when the South has been erroneously informed\r\n    that none such would be attempted, would produce most disastrous\r\n    results throughout our country. It is, of course, now too late\r\n    for me to give any advice in reference to the proposed scheme of\r\n    Captain Fox. I fear that its result can not fail to be\r\n    disastrous to all concerned. Even with his boat at our walls,\r\n    the loss of life (as I think I mentioned to Mr. Fox) in\r\n    unloading her will more than pay for the good to be accomplished\r\n    by the expedition, which keeps us, if I can maintain possession\r\n    of this work, out of position, surrounded by strong works which\r\n    must be carried to make this fort of the least value to the\r\n    United States Government.\r\n\r\n    \"We have not oil enough to keep a light in the lantern for one\r\n    night. The boats will have to, therefore, rely at night entirely\r\n    upon other marks. I ought to have been informed that this\r\n    expedition was to come. Colonel Lamon's remark convinced me that\r\n    the idea, merely hinted at to me by Captain Fox, would not be\r\n    carried out.[166]\r\n\r\n    \"We shall strive to do our duty, though I frankly say that my\r\n    heart is not in this war, which I see is to be thus commenced.\r\n    That God will still avert it, and cause us to resort to pacific\r\n    means to maintain our rights, is my ardent prayer!\r\n\r\n    \"I am, Colonel, very respectfully,\r\n\r\n    \"Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    \"Robert Anderson,\r\n\r\n    \"_Major 1st Artillery, commanding_.\"\r\n\r\nThis frank and manly letter, although written with the reserve\r\nnecessarily belonging to a communication from an officer to his military\r\nsuperiors, expressing dissatisfaction with orders, fully vindicates\r\nMajor Anderson from all suspicion of complicity or sympathy with the bad\r\nfaith of the Government which he was serving. It accords entirely with\r\nthe sentiments expressed in his private letter to me, already mentioned\r\nas lost or stolen, and exhibits him in the attitude of faithful\r\nperformance of a duty inconsistent with his domestic ties and repugnant\r\nto his patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe \"relief squadron,\" as with unconscious irony it was termed, was\r\nalready under way for Charleston, consisting, according to their own\r\nstatement, of eight vessels, carrying twenty-six guns and about fourteen\r\nhundred men, including the troops sent for reënforcement of the\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\nThese facts became known to the Confederate Government, and it was\r\nobvious that no time was to be lost in preparing for, and if possible\r\nanticipating the impending assault. The character of the instructions\r\ngiven General Beauregard in this emergency may be inferred from the\r\nensuing correspondence, which is here reproduced from contemporary\r\npublications:\r\n\r\n    \"Charleston, _April 8th_.\r\n\r\n    \"L.

On these conditions General\r\nBeauregard offered to refrain from opening fire upon him. In his reply\r\nMajor Anderson promises to evacuate the fort on the 15th of April,\r\n_provided_ he should not, before that time, receive \"controlling\r\ninstructions\" or \"additional supplies\" from his Government. He\r\nfurthermore offers to pledge himself not to open fire upon the\r\nConfederates, unless in the mean time compelled to do so by some hostile\r\nact against the fort _or the flag of his Government_.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as it was known to the Confederate commander that the\r\n\"controlling instructions\" were already issued, and that the \"additional\r\nsupplies\" were momentarily expected; inasmuch, also, as any attempt to\r\nintroduce the supplies would compel the opening of fire upon the vessels\r\nbearing them under the flag of the United States--thereby releasing\r\nMajor Anderson from his pledge--it is evident that his conditions could\r\nnot be accepted. It would have been merely, after the avowal of a\r\nhostile determination by the Government of the United States, to await\r\nan inevitable conflict with the guns of Fort Sumter and the naval forces\r\nof the United States in combination; with no possible hope of averting\r\nit, unless in the improbable event of a delay of the expected fleet for\r\nnearly four days longer. (In point of fact, it arrived off the harbor on\r\nthe same day, but was hindered by a gale of wind from entering it.)\r\nThere was obviously no other course to be pursued than that announced in\r\nthe answer given by General Beauregard.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten that, during the early occupation of Fort\r\nSumter by a garrison the attitude of which was at least offensive, no\r\nrestriction had been put upon their privilege of purchasing in\r\nCharleston fresh provisions, or any delicacies or comforts not directly\r\ntending to the supply of the means needful to hold the fort for an\r\nindefinite time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: See \"The Record of Fort Sumter,\" p. 37.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: The Count of Paris libels the memory of Major Anderson,\r\nand perverts the truth of history in this, as he has done in other\r\nparticulars, by saying, with reference to the visit of Captain Fox to\r\nthe fort, that, \"having visited Anderson at Fort Sumter, _a plan had\r\nbeen agreed upon between them for revictualing the garrison_.\"--(\"Civil\r\nWar in America,\" authorized translation, vol. i, chap. iv, p. 137.) Fox\r\nhimself says, in his published letter, \"I made no arrangements with\r\nMajor Anderson in for supplying the fort, nor did I inform him of my\r\nplan\"; and Major Anderson, in the letter above, says the idea had been\r\n\"merely hinted at\" by Captain Fox, and that Colonel Lamon had led him to\r\nbelieve that it had been abandoned.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n    A Pause and a Review.--Attitude of the Two Parties.--Sophistry\r\n    exposed and Shams torn away.--Forbearance of the Confederate\r\n    Government.--Who was the Aggressor?--Major Anderson's View, and\r\n    that of a Naval Officer.--Mr. Horace Greeley on the Fort Sumter\r\n    Case.--The Bombardment and Surrender.--Gallant Action of\r\n    ex-Senator Wigfall.--Mr. Lincoln's Statement of the Case.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, in the brief hour immediately before the outburst of the\r\nlong-gathering storm, although it can hardly be necessary for the reader\r\nwho has carefully considered what has already been written, we may pause\r\nfor a moment to contemplate the attitude of the parties to the contest\r\nand the grounds on which they respectively stand. I do not now refer to\r\nthe original causes of controversy--to the comparative claims of\r\nStatehood and Union, or to the question of the right or the wrong of\r\nsecession--but to the proximate and immediate causes of conflict.\r\n\r\nThe fact that South Carolina _was_ a State--whatever her relations may\r\nhave been to the other States--is not and can not be denied. It is\r\nequally undeniable that the ground on which Fort Sumter was built was\r\nceded by South Carolina to the United States _in trust_ for the defense\r\nof her own soil and her own chief harbor. This has been shown, by ample\r\nevidence, to have been the principle governing all cessions by the\r\nStates of sites for military purposes, but it applies with special force\r\nto the case of Charleston. The streams flowing into that harbor, from\r\nsource to mouth, lie entirely within the limits of the State of South\r\nCarolina. No other State or combination of States could have any\r\ndistinct interest or concern in the maintenance of a fortress at that\r\npoint, unless as a means of aggression against South Carolina herself.\r\nThe practical view of the case was correctly stated by Mr. Douglas, when\r\nhe said: \"I take it for granted that whoever permanently holds\r\nCharleston and South Carolina is entitled to the possession of Fort\r\nSumter. Whoever permanently holds Pensacola and Florida is entitled to\r\nthe possession of Fort Pickens. Whoever holds the States in whose limits\r\nthose forts are placed is entitled to the forts themselves, unless there\r\nis something peculiar in the location of some particular fort that makes\r\nit important for us to hold it for the general defense of the whole\r\ncountry, its commerce and interests, instead of being useful only for\r\nthe defense of a particular city or locality.\"\r\n\r\nNo such necessity could be alleged with regard to Fort Sumter. The claim\r\nto hold it as \"public property\" of the United States was utterly\r\nuntenable and unmeaning, apart from a claim of coercive control over the\r\nState. If South Carolina was a mere province, in a state of open\r\nrebellion, the Government of the United States had a right to retain its\r\nhold of any fortified place within her limits which happened to be in\r\nits possession, and it would have had an equal right to acquire\r\npossession of any other. It would have had the same right to send an\r\narmy to Columbia to batter down the walls of the State Capitol. The\r\nsubject may at once be stripped of the sophistry which would make a\r\ndistinction between the two cases. The one was as really an act of war\r\nas the other would have been. The right or the wrong of either depended\r\nentirely upon the question of the rightful power of the Federal\r\nGovernment to coerce a State into submission--a power which, as we have\r\nseen, was unanimously rejected in the formation of the Federal\r\nConstitution, and which was still unrecognized by many, perhaps by a\r\nmajority, even of those who denied the right of a State to secede.\r\n\r\nIf there existed any hope or desire for a peaceful settlement of the\r\nquestions at issue between the States, either party had a right to\r\ndemand that, pending such settlement, there should be no hostile grasp\r\nupon its throat. This grip had been held on the throat of South Carolina\r\nfor almost four months from the period of her secession, and no forcible\r\nresistance to it had yet been made. Remonstrances and patient,\r\npersistent, and reiterated attempts at negotiation for its removal had\r\nbeen made with two successive Administrations of the Government of the\r\nUnited States--at first by the State of South Carolina, and by the\r\nGovernment of the Confederate States after its formation. These efforts\r\nhad been met, not by an open avowal of coercive purposes, but by\r\nevasion, prevarication, and perfidy. The agreement of one Administration\r\nto maintain the _status quo_ at the time when the question arose, was\r\nviolated in December by the removal of the garrison from its original\r\nposition to the occupancy of a stronger. Another attempt was made to\r\nviolate it, in January, by the introduction of troops concealed below\r\nthe deck of the steamer Star of the West,[167] but this was thwarted by\r\nthe vigilance of the State service. The protracted course of fraud and\r\nprevarication practiced by Mr. Lincoln's Administration in the months of\r\nMarch and April has been fully exhibited. It was evident that no\r\nconfidence whatever could be reposed in any pledge or promise of the\r\nFederal Government as then administered. Yet, notwithstanding all this,\r\nno resistance, other than that of pacific protest and appeals for an\r\nequitable settlement, was made, until after the avowal of a purpose of\r\ncoercion, and when it was known that a hostile fleet was on the way to\r\nsupport and enforce it. At the very moment when the Confederate\r\ncommander gave the final notice to Major Anderson of his purpose to open\r\nfire upon the fort, that fleet was lying off the mouth of the harbor,\r\nand hindered from entering only by a gale of wind.\r\n\r\nThe forbearance of the Confederate Government, under the circumstances,\r\nis perhaps unexampled in history. It was carried to the extreme verge,\r\nshort of a disregard of the safety of the people who had intrusted to\r\nthat government the duty of their defense against their enemies. The\r\nattempt to represent us as the _aggressors_ in the conflict which ensued\r\nis as unfounded as the complaint made by the wolf against the lamb in\r\nthe familiar fable. He who makes the assault is not necessarily he that\r\nstrikes the first blow or fires the first gun. To have awaited further\r\nstrengthening of their position by land and naval forces, with hostile\r\npurpose now declared, for the sake of having them \"fire the first gun,\"\r\nwould have been as unwise as it would be to hesitate to strike down the\r\narm of the assailant, who levels a deadly weapon at one's breast, until\r\nhe has actually fired. The disingenuous rant of demagogues about \"firing\r\non the flag\" might serve to rouse the passions of insensate mobs in\r\ntimes of general excitement, but will be impotent in impartial history\r\nto relieve the Federal Government from the responsibility of the assault\r\nmade by sending a hostile fleet against the harbor of Charleston, to\r\ncoöperate with the menacing garrison of Fort Sumter. After the assault\r\nwas made by the hostile descent of the fleet, the reduction of Fort\r\nSumter was a measure of defense rendered absolutely and immediately\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nSuch clearly was the idea of the commander of the Pawnee, when he\r\ndeclined, as Captain Fox informs us, without orders from a superior, to\r\nmake any effort to enter the harbor, \"there to inaugurate civil war.\"\r\nThe straightforward simplicity of the sailor had not been perverted by\r\nthe shams of political sophistry. Even Mr. Horace Greeley, with all his\r\nextreme partisan feeling, is obliged to admit that, \"whether the\r\nbombardment and reduction of Fort Sumter shall or shall not be justified\r\nby posterity, it is clear that the Confederacy had no alternative but\r\nits own dissolution.\"[168]\r\n\r\nAccording to the notice given by General Beauregard, fire was opened\r\nupon Fort Sumter, from the various batteries which had been erected\r\naround the harbor, at half-past four o'clock on the morning of Friday,\r\nthe 12th of April, 1861. The fort soon responded. It is not the purpose\r\nof this work to give minute details of the military operation, as the\r\nevents of the bombardment have been often related, and are generally\r\nwell known, with no material discrepancy in matters of fact among the\r\nstatements of the various participants. It is enough, therefore, to add\r\nthat the bombardment continued for about thirty-three or thirty-four\r\nhours. The fort was eventually set on fire by shells, after having been\r\npartly destroyed by shot, and Major Anderson, after a resolute defense,\r\nfinally surrendered on the 13th--the same terms being accorded to him\r\nwhich had been offered two days before. It is a remarkable\r\nfact--probably without precedent in the annals of war--that,\r\nnotwithstanding the extent and magnitude of the engagement, the number\r\nand caliber of the guns, and the amount of damage done to inanimate\r\nmaterial on both sides, especially to Fort Sumter, nobody was injured on\r\neither side by the bombardment. The only casualty attendant upon the\r\naffair was the death of one man and the wounding of several others by\r\nthe explosion of a gun in the firing of a salute to their flag by the\r\ngarrison on evacuating the fort the day after the surrender.\r\n\r\nA striking incident marked the close of the bombardment. Ex-Senator\r\nLouis T. Wigfall, of Texas--a man as generous as he was recklessly\r\nbrave--when he saw the fort on fire, supposing the garrison to be\r\nhopelessly struggling for the honor of its flag, voluntarily and without\r\nauthority, went under fire in an open boat to the fort, and climbing\r\nthrough one of its embrasures asked for Major Anderson, and insisted\r\nthat he should surrender a fort which it was palpably impossible that he\r\ncould hold. Major Anderson agreed to surrender on the same terms and\r\nconditions that had been offered him before his works were battered in\r\nbreach, and the agreement between them to that effect was promptly\r\nratified by the Confederate commander. Thus unofficially was inaugurated\r\nthe surrender and evacuation of the fort.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States, in his message of July 4, 1861, to\r\nthe Federal Congress convened in extra session, said:\r\n\r\n    \"It is thus seen that the assault upon and reduction of Fort\r\n    Sumter was in no sense a matter of self-defense on the part of\r\n    the assailants. They well knew that the garrison in the fort\r\n    could by no possibility commit aggression upon them. They\r\n    knew--they were expressly notified--that the giving of bread to\r\n    the few brave and hungry men of the garrison was all which would\r\n    on that occasion be attempted, unless themselves, by resisting\r\n    so much, should provoke more.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln well knew that, if the brave men of the garrison were\r\nhungry, they had only him and his trusted advisers to thank for it. They\r\nhad been kept for months in a place where they ought not to have been,\r\ncontrary to the judgment of the General-in-Chief of his army, contrary\r\nto the counsels of the wisest statesmen in his confidence, and the\r\nprotests of the commander of the garrison. A word from him would have\r\nrelieved them at any moment in the manner most acceptable to them and\r\nmost promotive of peaceful results.\r\n\r\nBut, suppose the Confederate authorities had been disposed to yield, and\r\nto consent to the introduction of supplies for the maintenance of the\r\ngarrison, what assurance would they have had that nothing further would\r\nbe attempted? What reliance could be placed in any assurances of the\r\nGovernment of the United States after the experience of the attempted\r\n_ruse_ of the Star of the West and the deceptions practiced upon the\r\nConfederate Commissioners in Washington? He says we were \"expressly\r\nnotified\" that nothing more \"would _on that occasion_ be attempted\"--the\r\nwords in italics themselves constituting a very significant though\r\nunobtrusive and innocent-looking limitation. But we had been just as\r\nexpressly notified, long before, that the garrison would be withdrawn.\r\nIt would be as easy to violate the one pledge as it had been to break\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the so-called notification was a mere memorandum, without\r\ndate, signature, or authentication of any kind, sent to Governor\r\nPickens, not by an accredited agent, but by a subordinate employee of\r\nthe State Department. Like the oral and written pledges of Mr. Seward,\r\ngiven through Judge Campbell, it seemed to be carefully and purposely\r\ndivested of every attribute that could make it binding and valid, in\r\ncase its authors should see fit to repudiate it. It was as empty and\r\nworthless as the complaint against the Confederate Government based upon\r\nit, is disingenuous.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: See the report of her commander, Captain McGowan, who\r\nsays he took on board, in the harbor of New York, four officers and two\r\nhundred soldiers. Arriving off Charleston, he says, \"_The soldiers were\r\nnow all put below_, and no one allowed on deck except our own crew.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: \"American Conflict,\" vol. i, chap, xxix, p. 449.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\n_THE WAR._\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n    Failure of the Peace Congress.--Treatment of the\r\n    Commissioners.--Their Withdrawal.--Notice of an Armed\r\n    Expedition.--Action of the Confederate Government.--Bombardment\r\n    and Surrender of Fort Sumter.--Its Reduction required by the\r\n    Exigency of the Case.--Disguise thrown off.--President Lincoln's\r\n    Call for Seventy-five Thousand Men.--His Fiction of\r\n    \"Combinations.\"--Palpable Violation of the Constitution.--Action\r\n    of Virginia.--Of Citizens of Baltimore.--The Charge of\r\n    Precipitation against South Carolina.--Action of the Confederate\r\n    Government.--The Universal Feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Congress, initiated by Virginia for the laudable purpose of\r\nendeavoring, by constitutional means, to adjust all the issues which\r\nthreatened the peace of the country, failed to achieve anything that\r\nwould cause or justify a reconsideration by the seceded States of their\r\naction to reclaim the grants they had made to the General Government,\r\nand to maintain for themselves a separate and independent existence.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners sent by the Confederate Government, after having been\r\nshamefully deceived, as has been heretofore fully set forth, left the\r\nUnited States capital to report the result of their mission to the\r\nConfederate Government.\r\n\r\nThe notice received, that an armed expedition had sailed for operations\r\nagainst the State of South Carolina in the harbor of Charleston, induced\r\nthe Confederate Government to meet, as best it might, this assault, in\r\nthe discharge of its obligation to defend each State of the Confederacy.\r\nTo this end the bombardment of the formidable work, Fort Sumter, was\r\ncommenced, in anticipation of the reënforcement which was then moving to\r\nunite with its garrison for hostilities against South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe bloodless bombardment and surrender of Fort Sumter occurred on April\r\n13, 1861. The garrison was generously permitted to retire with the\r\nhonors of war. The evacuation of that fort, commanding the entrance to\r\nthe harbor of Charleston, which, if in hostile hands, was destructive of\r\nits commerce, had been claimed as the right of South Carolina. The\r\nvoluntary withdrawal of the garrison by the United States Government had\r\nbeen considered, and those best qualified to judge believed it had been\r\npromised. Yet, when instead of the fulfillment of just expectations,\r\ninstead of the withdrawal of the garrison, a hostile expedition was\r\norganized and sent forward, the urgency of the case required its\r\nreduction before it should be reënforced. Had there been delay, the more\r\nserious conflict between larger forces, land and naval, would scarcely\r\nhave been bloodless, as the bombardment fortunately was. The event,\r\nhowever, was seized upon to inflame the mind of the Northern people, and\r\nthe disguise which had been worn in the communications with the\r\nConfederate Commissioners was now thrown off, and it was cunningly\r\nattempted to show that the South, which had been pleading for peace and\r\nstill stood on the defensive, had by this bombardment inaugurated a war\r\nagainst the United States. But it should be stated that the threats\r\nimplied in the declarations that the Union could not exist part slave\r\nand part free, and that the Union should be preserved, and the denial of\r\nthe right of a State peaceably to withdraw, were virtually a declaration\r\nof war, and the sending of an army and navy to attack was the result to\r\nhave been anticipated as the consequence of such declaration of war.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th day of the same month, President Lincoln, introducing his\r\nfarce \"of combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary\r\ncourse of judicial proceedings,\" called forth the military of the\r\nseveral States to the number of seventy-five thousand, and commanded\r\n\"the persons composing the combinations\" to disperse, etc. It can but\r\nsurprise any one in the least degree conversant with the history of the\r\nUnion, to find States referred to as \"persons composing combinations,\"\r\nand that the sovereign creators of the Federal Government, the States of\r\nthe Union, should be commanded by their agent to disperse. The levy of\r\nso large an army could only mean war; but the power to declare war did\r\nnot reside in the President--it was delegated to the Congress only. If,\r\nhowever, it had been a riotous combination or an insurrection, it must\r\nhave been, according to the Constitution, against the State; and the\r\npower of the President to call forth the militia to suppress it, was\r\ndependent upon an application from the State for that purpose; it could\r\nnot precede such application, and still less could it be rightfully\r\nexercised against the will of a State. The authorities on this subject\r\nhave been heretofore cited, and need not be referred to again.\r\n\r\nSuffice it to say that, by section 4, Article IV, of the Constitution,\r\nthe United States are bound to protect each State against invasion and\r\nagainst domestic violence, whenever application shall have been made by\r\nthe Legislature, or by the Executive when the Legislature can not be\r\nconvened; and that to fail to give protection against any invasion\r\nwhatsoever would be a dereliction of duty. To add that there could be no\r\njustification for the invasion of a State by an army of the United\r\nStates, is but to repeat what has been said, on the absence of any\r\nauthority in the General Government to coerce a State. In any possible\r\nview of the case, therefore, the conclusion must be, that the calling on\r\nsome of the States for seventy-five thousand militia to invade other\r\nStates which were asserted to be still in the Union, was a palpable\r\nviolation of the Constitution, and the usurpation of undelegated power,\r\nor, in other words, of power reserved to the States or to the people.\r\n\r\nIt might, therefore, have been anticipated that Virginia--one of whose\r\nsons wrote the Declaration of Independence, another of whose sons led\r\nthe armies of the United States in the Revolution which achieved their\r\nindependence, and another of whose sons mainly contributed to the\r\nadoption of the Constitution of the Union--would not have been slow, in\r\nthe face of such events, to reclaim the grants she had made to the\r\nGeneral Government, and to withdraw from the Union, to the establishment\r\nof which she had so largely contributed.\r\n\r\nTwo days had elapsed between the surrender of Fort Sumter and the\r\nproclamation of President Lincoln calling for seventy-five thousand\r\nmilitia as before stated. Two other days elapsed, and Virginia passed\r\nher ordinance of secession, and two days thereafter the citizens of\r\nBaltimore resisted the passage of troops through that city on their way\r\nto make war upon the Southern States. Thus rapidly did the current of\r\nevents bear us onward from peace to the desolating war which was soon to\r\nensue.\r\n\r\nThe manly effort of the unorganized, unarmed citizens of Baltimore to\r\nresist the progress of armies for the invasion of her Southern sisters,\r\nwas worthy of the fair fame of Maryland; becoming the descendants of the\r\nmen who so gallantly fought for the freedom, independence, and\r\nsovereignty of the States.\r\n\r\nThe bold stand, then and thereafter taken, extorted a promise from the\r\nExecutive authorities that no more troops should be sent through the\r\ncity of Baltimore, which promise, however, was only observed until, by\r\nartifice, power had been gained to disregard it.\r\n\r\nVirginia, as has been heretofore stated, passed her ordinance of\r\nsecession on the 17th of April. It was, however, subject to ratification\r\nby the people at an election to be held on the fourth Thursday of May.\r\nShe was in the mean time, like her Southern sisters, the object of\r\nNorthern hostilities, and, having a common cause with them, properly\r\nanticipated the election of May by forming an alliance with the\r\nConfederate States, which was ratified by the Convention on the 25th of\r\nApril.\r\n\r\nThe Convention for that alliance set forth that Virginia, looking to a\r\nspeedy union with the Confederate States, and for the purpose of meeting\r\npressing exigencies, agreed that \"the whole military force and military\r\noperations, offensive and defensive, of said Commonwealth, in the\r\nimpending conflict with the United States, shall be under the chief\r\ncontrol and direction of the President of the said Confederate States.\"\r\nThe whole was made subject to the approval and ratification of the\r\nproper authorities of both governments respectively.\r\n\r\nTo those who criticise South Carolina as having acted precipitately in\r\nwithdrawing from the Union, it may be answered that intervening\r\noccurrences show that her delay could not have changed the result; and,\r\nfurther, that her prompt action had enabled her better to prepare for\r\nthe contingency which it was found impossible to avert. Thus she was\r\nprepared in the first necessities of Virginia to send to her troops\r\norganized and equipped.\r\n\r\nBefore the convention for coöperation with the Confederate States had\r\nbeen adopted by Virginia, that knightly soldier, General Bonham, of\r\nSouth Carolina, went with his brigade to Richmond; and, throughout the\r\nSouthern States, there was a prevailing desire to rush to Virginia,\r\nwhere it was foreseen that the first great battles of the war were to be\r\nfought; so that, as early as the 22d of April, I telegraphed to Governor\r\nLetcher that, in addition to the forces heretofore ordered, requisitions\r\nhad been made for thirteen regiments, eight to rendezvous at Lynchburg,\r\nfour at Richmond, and one at Harper's Ferry. Referring to an application\r\nthat had been made to him from Baltimore, I wrote: \"Sustain Baltimore if\r\npracticable. We will reënforce you.\" The universal feeling was that of a\r\ncommon cause and common destiny. There was no selfish desire to linger\r\naround home, no narrow purpose to separate local interests from the\r\ncommon welfare. The object was to sustain a principle--the broad\r\nprinciple of constitutional liberty, the right of self-government.\r\n\r\nThe early demonstrations of the enemy showed that Virginia was liable to\r\ninvasion from the north, from the east, and from the west. Though the\r\nlarger preparation indicated that the most serious danger to be\r\napprehended was from the line of the Potomac, the first conflicts\r\noccurred in the east.\r\n\r\nThe narrow peninsula between the James and York Rivers had topographical\r\nfeatures well adapted to defense. It was held by General John B.\r\nMagruder, who skillfully improved its natural strength by artificial\r\nmeans, and there, on the ground memorable as the field of the last\r\nbattle of the Revolution, in which General Washington compelled Lord\r\nCornwallis to surrender, Magruder, with a small force, held for a long\r\ntime the superior forces of the enemy in check.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    The Supply of Arms; of Men.--Love of the Union.--Secessionists\r\n    few.--Efforts to prevent the Final Step.--Views of the\r\n    People.--Effect on their Agriculture.--Aid from African\r\n    Servitude.--Answer to the Clamors on the Horrors of\r\n    Slavery.--Appointment of a Commissary-General.--His Character\r\n    and Capacity.--Organization, Instruction, and Equipment of the\r\n    Army.--Action of Congress.--The Law.--Its Signification.--The\r\n    Hope of a Peaceful Solution early entertained; rapidly\r\n    diminished.--Further Action of Congress.--Policy of the\r\n    Government for Peace.--Position of Officers of United States\r\n    Army.--The Army of the States, not of the Government.--The\r\n    Confederate Law observed by the Government.--Officers retiring\r\n    from United States Army.--Organization of Bureaus.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of supplying arms and munitions of war was the first\r\nconsidered, because it was the want for which it was the most difficult\r\nto provide. Of men willing to engage in the defense of their country,\r\nthere were many more than we could arm.\r\n\r\nThough the prevailing sentiment of the Southern people was a cordial\r\nattachment to the Union as it was formed by their fathers, their love\r\nwas for the spirit of the compact, for the liberties it was designed to\r\nsecure, for the self-government and State sovereignty which had been won\r\nby separation from the mother-country, and transmitted to them by their\r\nRevolutionary sires as a legacy for their posterity for ever. The number\r\nof those who desired to dissolve the Union, even though the Constitution\r\nshould be faithfully observed--those who, in the language of the day,\r\nwere called \"secessionists _per se_\"--was so small as not to be felt in\r\nany popular decision; but the number of those who held that the States\r\nhad surrendered their sovereignty, and had no right to secede from the\r\nUnion, was so inappreciably small, if indeed any such existed, that I\r\ncan not recall the fact of a single Southern advocate of that opinion.\r\nThe assertion of the right is not to be confounded with a readiness to\r\nexercise it. Many who had no doubt as to the right, looked upon its\r\nexercise with reluctance amounting to sorrow, and claimed that it should\r\nbe the last resort, only to be adopted as the alternative to a surrender\r\nof the equality in the Union of States, free, sovereign, and\r\nindependent. Of that class, forming a large majority of the people of\r\nMississippi, I may speak with the confidence of one who belonged to it.\r\nThus, after the Legislature of Mississippi had enacted a law for a\r\nconvention which, representing the sovereignty of the State, should\r\nconsider the propriety of passing an ordinance to reassume the grants\r\nmade to the General Government, and withdraw from the Union, I, as a\r\nUnited States Senator of Mississippi, retained my position in the\r\nSenate, and sought by every practicable mode to obtain such measures as\r\nwould allay the excitement and afford to the South such security as\r\nwould prevent the final step, the ordinance of secession from the Union.\r\n\r\nWhen the last hope of preserving the Union of the Constitution was\r\nextinguished, and the ordinance of secession was enacted by the\r\nConvention of Mississippi, which was the highest authority known under\r\nour form of government, the question of the expediency of adopting that\r\nremedy was no longer open to inquiry by one who acknowledged his\r\nallegiance as due to the State of which he was a citizen. To evade the\r\nresponsibilities resulting from the decree of his sovereign, the people,\r\nwould be craven; to resist it would be treason. The instincts and\r\naffections of the citizens of Mississippi led them with great unanimity\r\nto the duty of maintaining and defending their State, without pausing to\r\nask what would be the consequences of refusing obedience to its mandate.\r\nA like feeling pervaded all of the seceding States, and it was not only\r\nfor the military service, but for every service which would strengthen\r\nand sustain the Confederacy, that an enthusiasm pervading all classes,\r\nsexes, and ages was manifested.\r\n\r\nThough our agricultural products had been mainly for export, insomuch\r\nthat in the planting States the necessary food-supplies were to a\r\nconsiderable extent imported from the West, and it would require that\r\nthe habits of the planters should be changed from the cultivation of\r\nstaples for export to the production of supplies adequate for home\r\nconsumption and the support of armies in the field, yet, even under the\r\nembarrassments of war, this was expected, and for a long time the result\r\njustified the expectation, extraordinary as it must appear when viewed\r\nby comparison with other people who have been subjected to a like\r\nordeal. Much of our success was due to the much-abused institution of\r\nAfrican servitude, for it enabled the white men to go into the army, and\r\nleave the cultivation of their fields and the care of their flocks, as\r\nwell as of their wives and children, to those who, in the language of\r\nthe Constitution, were \"held to service or labor.\" A passing remark may\r\nhere be appropriate as to the answer thus afforded to the clamor about\r\nthe \"horrors of slavery.\"\r\n\r\nHad these Africans been a cruelly oppressed people, restlessly\r\nstruggling to be freed from their bonds, would their masters have dared\r\nto leave them, as was done, and would they have remained as they did,\r\ncontinuing their usual duties, or could the proclamation of emancipation\r\nhave been put on the plea of a military necessity, if the fact had been\r\nthat the negroes were forced to serve, and desired only an opportunity\r\nto rise against their masters? It will be remembered that, when the\r\nproclamation was issued, it was confessed by President Lincoln to be a\r\nnullity beyond the limit within which it could be enforced by the\r\nFederal troops.\r\n\r\nTo direct the production, preservation, collection, and distribution of\r\nfood for the army required a man of rare capacity and character at the\r\nhead of the subsistence department. It was our good fortune to have such\r\nan one in Colonel L. B. Northrop, who was appointed commissary-general\r\nat the organization of the bureaus of the executive department of the\r\nConfederate Government. He had been an officer of the United States\r\nArmy, had served in various parts of the South, had been for some time\r\non duty in the commissariat, and, to the special and general knowledge\r\nthus acquired, added strong practical sense and incorruptible integrity.\r\nOf him and the operations of the subsistence department I shall have\r\nmore to say hereafter, when treating of the bureaus of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nAssured of an army as large as the population of the Confederate States\r\ncould furnish, and a sufficient supply of subsistence for such an army,\r\nat least until the chances of war should interfere with production and\r\ntransportation, the immediate object of attention was the organization,\r\ninstruction, and equipment of the army.\r\n\r\nAs heretofore stated, there was a prevailing belief that there would be\r\nno war, or, if any, that it would be of very short duration. Therefore\r\nthe first bill which passed the provisional Congress provided for\r\nreceiving troops for short periods--as my memory serves, for sixty days.\r\nThe chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs, the heroic Colonel\r\nBartow, who sealed his devotion to the cause with his life's blood on\r\nthe field of Manassas, in deference to my earnest remonstrance against\r\nsuch a policy, returned with the bill to the House (the Congress then\r\nconsisted of but one House), and procured a modification by which the\r\nterm of service was extended to twelve months unless sooner discharged.\r\n\r\nI had urged upon him, in our conference, the adoption of a much longer\r\nperiod, but he assured me that one year was as much as the Congress\r\nwould agree to. On this, as on other occasions, that Congress showed a\r\ngenerous desire to yield their preconceived opinions to my objections as\r\nfar as they consistently could, and, there being but one House, it was\r\neasier to change the terms of a bill after conference with the Executive\r\nthan when, under the permanent organization, objections had to be\r\nformally communicated in a message to that branch of Congress in which\r\nthe bill originated, and when the whole proceeding was of record.\r\n\r\nThis first act to provide for the public defense became a law on the\r\n28th of February, 1861, and its fifth section so clearly indicates the\r\nopinions and expectations prevailing when the Confederation was formed,\r\nthat it is inserted here:\r\n\r\n    \"That the President be further authorized to receive into the\r\n    service of this Government such forces now in the service of\r\n    said States (Confederate States) as may be tendered, or who may\r\n    volunteer by consent of their State, in such numbers as he may\r\n    require for any time not less than twelve months unless sooner\r\n    discharged.\"\r\n\r\nThe supremacy of the States is the controlling idea. The President was\r\nauthorized to receive from the several States the arms and munitions\r\nwhich they might desire to transfer to the Government of the Confederate\r\nStates, and he was also authorized to receive the forces which the\r\nStates might tender, or any which should volunteer by the _consent of\r\ntheir State_, for any time not less than twelve months unless sooner\r\ndischarged; and such forces were to be received with their officers by\r\ncompanies, battalions, or regiments, and the President, by and with the\r\nadvice and consent of Congress, was to appoint such general officer or\r\nofficers for said forces as might be necessary for the service.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the arms and munitions within the limits of the\r\nseveral States were regarded as entirely belonging to them; that the\r\nforces which were to constitute the provisional army could only be drawn\r\nfrom the several States by their consent, and that these were to be\r\norganized under State authority and to be received with their officers\r\nso appointed; that the lowest organization was to be that of a company\r\nand the highest that of a regiment, and that the appointment of general\r\nofficers to command these forces was confided to the Government of the\r\nConfederate States, should the assembling of large bodies of troops\r\nrequire organization above that of a regiment; and it will also be\r\nobserved that provision was made for the discharge of the forces so\r\nprovided for, before the term of service fixed by the law. No one will\r\nfail to perceive how little was anticipated a war of the vast\r\nproportions and great duration which ensued, and how tenaciously the\r\nsovereignty and self-government of the States were adhered to. At a\r\nlater period (March 16, 1861) the Congress adopted resolutions\r\nrecommending to the respective States to \"cede the forts, arsenals,\r\nnavy-yards, dock-yards, and other public establishments within their\r\nrespective limits to the Confederate States,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe hope which was early entertained of a peaceful solution of the\r\nissues pending between the Confederate States and the United States\r\nrapidly diminished, so that we find on the 6th of March that the\r\nCongress, in its preamble to an act to provide for the public defense,\r\nbegins with the declaration that, \"in order to provide speedily forces\r\nto repel invasion,\" etc., authorized the President to employ the\r\nmilitia, and to ask for and accept the services of any number of\r\nvolunteers, not exceeding one hundred thousand, and to organize\r\ncompanies into battalions, battalions into regiments, and regiments into\r\nbrigades and divisions. As in the first law, the President was\r\nauthorized to appoint the commanding officer of such brigades and\r\ndivisions, the commissions only to endure while the brigades were in\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nOn the same day (March 6, 1861) was enacted the law for the\r\nestablishment and organization of the Army of the Confederate States of\r\nAmerica, this being in contradistinction to the provisional army, which\r\nwas to be composed of troops tendered by the States, as in the first\r\nact, and volunteers received, as in the second act, to constitute a\r\nprovisional army. That the wish and policy of the Government was peace\r\nis again manifested in this act, which, in providing for the military\r\nestablishment of the Confederacy, fixed the number of enlisted men of\r\nall arms at nine thousand four hundred and twenty. Due care was taken to\r\nprevent the appointment of incompetent or unworthy persons to be\r\nofficers of the army, and the right to promotion up to and including the\r\ngrade of colonel was carefully guarded, and beyond this the professional\r\ncharacter of the army was recognized as follows: \"Appointments to the\r\nrank of brigadier-general, after the army is organized, shall be made by\r\nselection from the army.\" There being no right of promotion above the\r\ngrade of colonel in the Army of the United States, selection for\r\nappointment to the rank of general had no other restriction than the\r\nnecessity for confirmation by the Senate. The provision just quoted\r\nimposed the further restriction of requiring the person nominated by\r\nselection to have previously been an officer of the Army of the\r\nConfederate States.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Army of the United States as belonging neither to a\r\nsection of the Union nor to the General Government, but to the States\r\nconjointly while they remained united, it follows as a corollary of the\r\nproposition that, when disintegration occurred, the undivided\r\n_personnel_ composing the army would be left free to choose their future\r\nplace of service. Therefore, provision was made for securing to\r\nofficers, who should leave the Army of the United States and join that\r\nof the Confederate States, the same relative rank in the latter which\r\nthey held in the former.\r\n\r\n    \"Be it further enacted that all officers who have resigned, or\r\n    who may within six months tender their resignations, from the\r\n    Army of the United States, and who have been or may be appointed\r\n    to original vacancies in the Army of the Confederate States, the\r\n    commissions issued shall bear one and the same date, so that the\r\n    relative rank of officers of each grade shall be determined by\r\n    their former commissions in the United States Army, held\r\n    anterior to the secession of these Confederate States from the\r\n    United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe provisions hereof are in the view entertained that the army was of\r\nthe States, not of the Government, and was to secure to officers\r\nadhering to the Confederate States the same relative rank which they had\r\nbefore those States had withdrawn from the Union. It was clearly the\r\nintent of the law to embrace in this provision only those officers who\r\nhad resigned or who should resign from the United States Army to enter\r\nthe service of the Confederacy, or who, in other words, should thus be\r\ntransferred from one service to the other. It is also to be noted that,\r\nin the eleventh section of the act to which this was amendatory, the\r\nright of promotion up to the grade of colonel, in established regiments\r\nand corps, was absolutely secured, but that appointments to the higher\r\ngrade should be by selection, at first without restriction, but after\r\nthe army had been organized the selection was confined to the army, thus\r\nrecognizing the profession of arms, and relieving officers from the\r\nhazard, beyond the limit of their legal right to promotion, of being\r\nsuperseded by civilians through favoritism or political influence.\r\n\r\nHow well the Government of the Confederacy observed both the letter and\r\nthe spirit of the law will be seen by reference to its action in the\r\nmatter of appointments. It is a noteworthy fact that the three highest\r\nofficers in rank, and whose fame stands unchallenged either for\r\nefficiency or zeal, were all so indifferent to any question of personal\r\ninterest, that they had received their appointment before they were\r\naware it was to be conferred. Each brought from the Army of the United\r\nStates an enviable reputation, such as would have secured to him, had he\r\nchosen to remain in it, after the war commenced, any position his\r\nambition could have coveted. Therefore, against considerations of\r\nself-interest, and impelled by devotion to principle, they severed the\r\nties, professional and personal, which had bound them from their youth\r\nup to the time when the Southern States, asserting the consecrated truth\r\nthat all governments rest on the consent of the governed, decided to\r\nwithdraw from the Union they had voluntarily entered, and the Northern\r\nStates resolved to coerce them to remain in it against their will. These\r\nofficers were--first, Samuel Cooper, a native of New York, a graduate of\r\nthe United States Military Academy in 1815, and who served continuously\r\nin the army until March 7, 1861, with such distinction as secured to him\r\nthe appointment of Adjutant-General of the United States Army. Second,\r\nAlbert Sidney Johnston, a native of Kentucky, a graduate of the United\r\nStates Military Academy in 1826, served conspicuously in the army until\r\n1834, then served in the army of the Republic of Texas, and then in the\r\nUnited States Volunteers in the war with Mexico. Subsequently he\r\nreëntered the United States Army, and for meritorious conduct attained\r\nthe rank of brevet brigadier-general. After the secession of Texas, his\r\nadopted State, he resigned his commission in the United States Army, May\r\n3, 1861, and traveled by land from California to Richmond to offer his\r\nservices to the Confederacy. Third, Robert E. Lee, a native of Virginia,\r\na graduate of the United States Military Academy in 1829, when he was\r\nappointed in the Engineer Corps of the United States Army, and served\r\ncontinuously and with such distinction as to secure for him in 1847\r\nbrevets of three grades above his corps commission. He resigned from the\r\nArmy of the United States, April 25, 1861, upon the secession of\r\nVirginia, in whose army he served until it was transferred to the\r\nConfederate States.\r\n\r\nSamuel Cooper was the first of these to offer his services to the\r\nConfederacy at Montgomery. Having known him most favorably and\r\nintimately as Adjutant-General of the United States Army when I was\r\nSecretary of War, the value of his services in the organization of a new\r\narmy was considered so great that I invited him to take the position of\r\nAdjutant-General of the Confederate Army, which he accepted without a\r\nquestion either as to relative rank or anything else. The highest grade\r\nthen authorized by law was that of brigadier-general, and that\r\ncommission was bestowed upon him.\r\n\r\nWhen General Albert Sidney Johnston reached Richmond he called upon me,\r\nand for several days at various intervals we conversed with the freedom\r\nand confidence belonging to the close friendship which had existed\r\nbetween us for many years. Consequent upon a remark made by me, he asked\r\nto what duty I would assign him, and, when answered, to serve in the\r\nWest, he expressed his pleasure at service in that section, but inquired\r\nhow he was to raise his command, and for the first time learned that he\r\nhad been nominated and confirmed as a general in the Army of the\r\nConfederacy.\r\n\r\nThe third, General Robert E. Lee, had been commissioned by the State of\r\nVirginia as major-general and commander of her army. When that army was\r\ntransferred, after the accession of Virginia to the Confederate States,\r\nhe was nominated to be brigadier-general in the Confederate Army, but\r\nwas left for obvious reasons in command of the forces in Virginia. After\r\nthe seat of government was removed from Montgomery to Richmond, the\r\ncourse of events on the Southern Atlantic coast induced me to direct\r\nGeneral Lee to repair thither. Before leaving, he said that, while he\r\nwas serving in Virginia, he had never thought it needful to inquire\r\nabout his rank; but now, when about to go into other States and to meet\r\nofficers with whom he had not been previously connected, he would like\r\nto be informed upon that point. Under recent laws, authorizing\r\nappointments to higher grades than that of his first commission, he had\r\nbeen appointed a full general; but so wholly had his heart and his mind\r\nbeen consecrated to the public service, that he had not remembered, if\r\nhe ever knew, of his advancement.\r\n\r\nIn organizing the bureaus, it was deemed advisable to select, for the\r\nchief of each, officers possessing special knowledge of the duties to be\r\nperformed. The best assurance of that qualification was believed to be\r\nservice creditably rendered in the several departments of the United\r\nStates Army before resigning from it. Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel A. C.\r\nMyers, who had held many important trusts in the United States\r\nQuartermaster's Department, was appointed Quartermaster-General of the\r\nConfederacy, with the rank of colonel.\r\n\r\nCaptain L. B. Northrop, a gallant officer of the United States Dragoons,\r\nand who, by reason of a wound disabling him to perform regimental duty,\r\nhad been employed in the subsistence department, was, after resigning\r\nfrom the United States Army, appointed Commissary-General of the\r\nConfederate States Army, with the rank of colonel. I have heretofore\r\nalluded to the difficult task thus imposed on him, and the success with\r\nwhich he performed it, and would be pleased here to enter into a fuller\r\nrecital, but have not the needful information in regard to his\r\nadministration of that department.\r\n\r\nSurgeon L. P. Moore, an officer of recognized merit in the United States\r\nMedical Department, from which he had resigned to join the Confederacy,\r\nwas appointed the Surgeon-General of the Confederate States Army. As in\r\nthe case of other departments, there was in this a want of the stores\r\nrequisite, as well for the field as the hospital.\r\n\r\nTo supply medicines which were declared by the enemy to be contraband of\r\nwar, our medical department had to seek in the forest for substitutes,\r\nand to add surgical instruments and appliances to the small stock on\r\nhand as best they could.\r\n\r\nIt would be quite beyond my power to do justice to the skill and\r\nknowledge with which the medical corps performed their arduous task, and\r\nregret that I have no report from the Surgeon-General, Moore, which\r\nwould enable me to do justice to the officers of his corps, as well in\r\nregard to their humanity as to their professional skill.\r\n\r\nIn no branch of our service were our needs so great and our means to\r\nmeet them relatively so small as in the matter of ordnance and ordnance\r\nstores. The Chief of Ordnance, General Gorgas, had been an ordnance\r\nofficer of the United States Army, and resigned to join the Confederacy.\r\nHe has favored me with a succinct though comprehensive statement, which\r\nhas enabled me to write somewhat fully of that department; but, for the\r\nbetter understanding of its operations, the reader is referred to the\r\nordnance report elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n    Commissioners to purchase Arms and Ammunition.--My Letter to\r\n    Captain Semmes.--Resignations of Officers of United States\r\n    Navy.--Our Destitution of Accessories for the Supply of Naval\r\n    Vessels.--Secretary Mallory.--Food-Supplies.--The Commissariat\r\n    Department.--The Quartermaster's Department.--The Disappearance\r\n    of Delusions.--The Supply of Powder.--Saltpeter.--Sulphur.--\r\n    Artificial Niter-Beds.--Services of General G.

Captain (afterward Admiral) Semmes, the officer who was\r\nsent to the North, would have been quite successful but for the\r\nintervention of the civil authorities, preventing the delivery of the\r\nvarious articles contracted for. The officer who was sent to Europe,\r\nMajor Huse, found few serviceable arms upon the market; he, however,\r\nsucceeded in making contracts for the manufacture of large quantities,\r\nbeing in advance of the agents sent from the Northern Government for the\r\nsame purpose. For further and more detailed information, reference is\r\nmade to the monograph of the Chief of Ordnance.\r\n\r\nMy letter of instructions to Captain Semmes was as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Montgomery, Alabama, _February 21, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Sir: As agent of the Confederate States, you are\r\n    authorized to proceed, as hereinafter set forth, to make\r\n    purchases, and contracts for machinery and munitions, or for the\r\n    manufacture of arms and munitions of war.\r\n\r\n    \"Of the proprietor of the ---- Powder Company, in ----, you will\r\n    probably be able to obtain cannon- and musket-powder--the former\r\n    to be of the coarsest grain; and also to engage with him for the\r\n    establishment of a powder-mill at some point in the limits of\r\n    our territory.\r\n\r\n    \"The quantity of powder to be supplied immediately will exceed\r\n    his stock on hand, and the arrangement for further supply\r\n    should, if possible, be by manufacture in our own territory; if\r\n    this is not practicable, means must be sought for further\r\n    shipments from any and all sources which are reliable.\r\n\r\n    \"At the arsenal at Washington you will find an artisan named\r\n    ----, who has brought the cap-making machine to its present\r\n    state of efficiency, and who might furnish a cap-machine, and\r\n    accompany it to direct its operations. If not in this, I hope\r\n    you may in some other way be able to obtain a cap-machine with\r\n    little delay, and have it sent to the Mount Vernon Arsenal,\r\n    Alabama.\r\n\r\n    \"We shall require a manufactory for friction-primers, and you\r\n    will, if possible, induce some capable person to establish one\r\n    in our country. The demand of the Confederate States will be the\r\n    inducement in this as in the case of the powder-mill proposed.\r\n\r\n    \"A short time since, the most improved machinery for the\r\n    manufacture of rifles, intended for the Harper's Ferry Armory,\r\n    was, it was said, for sale by the manufacturer. If it be so at\r\n    this time, you will procure it for this Government, and use the\r\n    needful precaution in relation to its transportation. Mr. ----\r\n    ----, of the Harper's Ferry Armory, can give you all the\r\n    information in that connection which you may require. Mr. Ball,\r\n    the master armorer at Harper's Ferry, is willing to accept\r\n    service under our Government, and could probably bring with him\r\n    skilled workmen. If we get the machinery, this will be\r\n    important.\r\n\r\n    \"Machinery for grooving muskets and heavy guns is, I hope, to be\r\n    purchased ready made. If not, you will contract for its\r\n    manufacture and delivery. You will endeavor to obtain the most\r\n    improved shot for rifled cannon, and persons skilled in the\r\n    preparation of that and other fixed ammunition. Captain G. W.\r\n    Smith and Captain Lovell, late of the United States Army, and\r\n    now of New York City, may aid you in your task; and you will\r\n    please say to them that we will be happy to have their services\r\n    in our army.\r\n\r\n    \"You will make such inquiries as your varied knowledge will\r\n    suggest in relation to the supply of guns of different calibers,\r\n    especially the largest. I suggest the advantage, if to be\r\n    obtained, of having a few of the fifteen-inch guns, like the one\r\n    cast at Pittsburg.\r\n\r\n    \"I have not sought to prescribe so as to limit your inquiries,\r\n    either as to object or place, but only to suggest for your\r\n    reflection and consideration the points which have chanced to\r\n    come under my observation. You will use your discretion in\r\n    visiting places where information of persons or things is to be\r\n    obtained for the furtherance of the object in view. Any\r\n    contracts made will be sent to the Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary\r\n    of War, for his approval; and the contractor need not fear that\r\n    delay will be encountered in the action of this Government.\r\n\r\n    \"Very respectfully yours, etc.,\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Semmes had also been directed to seek for vessels which would\r\nserve for naval purposes, and, after his return, reported that he could\r\nnot find any vessels which in his judgment were, or could be made,\r\navailable for our uses. The Southern officers of the navy who were in\r\ncommand of United States vessels abroad, under an idea more creditable\r\nto their sentiment than to their knowledge of the nature of our\r\nconstitutional Union, brought the vessels they commanded into the ports\r\nof the North, and, having delivered them to the authorities of the\r\nUnited States Government, generally tendered their resignations, and\r\nrepaired to the States from which they had been commissioned in the\r\nnavy, to serve where they held their allegiance to be due. The theory\r\nthat they owed allegiance to their respective States was founded on the\r\nfact that the Federal Government was of the States; the sequence was,\r\nthat the navy belonged to the States, not to their agent the Federal\r\nGovernment; and, when the States ceased to be united, the naval vessels\r\nand armament should have been divided among the owners. While we honor\r\nthe sentiment which caused them to surrender their heart-bound\r\nassociations, and the profession to which they were bred, on which they\r\nrelied for subsistence, to go, with nothing save their swords and\r\nfaithful hearts, to fight, to bleed, and to die if need be, in defense\r\nof their homes and a righteous cause, we can but remember how much was\r\nlost by their view of what their honor and duty demanded. Far, however,\r\nbe it from their countrymen, for that or any other consideration, to\r\nwish that their fidelity to the dictates of a conscientious belief\r\nshould have yielded to any temptation of interest. The course they\r\npursued shows how impossible it was that they should have done so, for\r\nwhat did they not sacrifice to their sense of right! We were doubly\r\nbereft by losing our share of the navy we had contributed to build, and\r\nby having it all employed to assail us. The application of the\r\nappropriations for the Navy of the United States had been such that the\r\nconstruction of vessels had been at the North, though much of the timber\r\nused and other material employed was transported from the South to\r\nNorthern ship-yards. Therefore, we were without the accessories needful\r\nfor the rapid supply of naval vessels.\r\n\r\nWhile attempting whatever was practicable at home, we sent a competent,\r\nwell-deserving officer of the navy to England to obtain there and\r\nelsewhere, by purchase or by building, vessels which could be\r\ntransformed into ships of war. These efforts and their results will be\r\nnoticed more fully hereafter.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss to remark here that, if the anticipations of our\r\npeople were not realized, it was not from any lack of the zeal and\r\nability of the Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Mallory. As was heretofore\r\nstated, his fondness for and aptitude in nautical affairs had led him to\r\nknow much of vessels, their construction and management, and, as\r\nchairman of the Committee on United States Naval Affairs, he had\r\nsuperadded to this a very large acquaintance with officers of the United\r\nStates Navy, which gave him the requisite information for the most\r\nuseful employment of the instructed officers who joined our service.\r\n\r\nAt the North many had been deceived by the fictions of preparations at\r\nthe South for the war of the sections, and among ourselves were few who\r\nrealized how totally deficient the Southern States were in all which was\r\nnecessary to the active operations of an army, however gallant the men\r\nmight be, and however able were the generals who directed and led them.\r\nFrom these causes, operating jointly, resulted undue caution at the\r\nNorth and overweening confidence at the South. The habits of our people\r\nin hunting, and protecting their stock in fields from the ravages of\r\nferocious beasts, caused them to be generally supplied with the arms\r\nused for such purposes. The facility with which individuals traveled\r\nover the country led to very erroneous ideas as to the difficulties of\r\ntransporting an army. The small amount of ammunition required in time of\r\npeace gave no measure of the amount requisite for warlike operations,\r\nand the products of a country, which insufficiently supplied food for\r\nits inhabitants when peaceful pursuits were uninterrupted, would serve\r\nbut a short time to furnish the commissariat of a large army. It was, of\r\ncourse, easy to foresee that, if war was waged against the seceding\r\nStates by all of those which remained in the Union, the large supply of\r\nprovisions which had been annually sent from the Northwest to the South\r\ncould not, under the altered circumstances, be relied on. That our\r\npeople did not more immediately turn their attention to the production\r\nof food-supplies, may be attributed to the prevailing delusion that\r\nsecession would not be followed by war. To the able officer then at the\r\nhead of the commissariat department, Colonel L. B. Northrop, much credit\r\nis due for his well-directed efforts to provide both for immediate and\r\nprospective wants. It gives me the greater pleasure to say this, because\r\nthose less informed of all he did, and skillfully tried to do, have been\r\nprofuse of criticism, and sparing indeed of the meed justly his due.\r\nAdequate facilities for transportation might have relieved the local\r\nwant of supplies, especially in Virginia, where the largest bodies of\r\ntroops were assembled; but, unfortunately, the quartermaster's\r\ndepartment was scarcely less provided than that of the commissary. Not\r\nonly were the railroads insufficient in number, but they were poorly\r\nfurnished with rolling stock, and had been mainly dependent upon\r\nNorthern foundries and factories for their rails and equipment. Even the\r\nskilled operatives of the railroads were generally Northern men, and\r\ntheir desertion followed fast upon every disaster which attended the\r\nConfederate arms. In addition to other causes which have been mentioned,\r\nthe idea that Cotton was king, and would produce foreign intervention,\r\nas well as a desire of the Northern people for the return of peace and\r\nthe restoration of trade, exercised a potent influence in preventing our\r\nagriculturists from directing at an early period their capital and labor\r\nto the production of food-supplies rather than that of our staple for\r\nexport. As one after another the illusions vanished, and the material\r\nnecessities of a great war were recognized by our people, never did\r\npatriotic devotion exhibit brighter examples of the sacrifice of\r\nself-interest and the abandonment of fixed habits and opinions, or more\r\neffective and untiring effort to meet the herculean task which was set\r\nbefore them. Being one of the few who regarded secession and war as\r\ninevitably connected, my early attention was given to the organization\r\nof military forces and the procurement and preparation of the munitions\r\nof war. If our people had not gone to war without counting the cost,\r\nthey were, nevertheless, involved in it without means of providing for\r\nits necessities. It has been heretofore stated that we had no\r\npowder-mills. It would be needless to say that the new-born Government\r\nhad no depots of powder, but it may be well to add that, beyond the\r\nsmall supply required for sporting purposes, our local traders had no\r\nstock on hand. Having no manufacturing industries which required\r\nsaltpeter, very little of that was purchasable in our markets. The same\r\nwould have been the case in regard to sulphur, but for the fact that it\r\nhad been recently employed in the clarification of sugar-cane juice, and\r\nthus a considerable amount of it was found in New Orleans. Prompt\r\nmeasures were taken to secure a supply of sulphur, and parties were\r\nemployed to obtain saltpeter from the caves, as well as from the earth\r\nof old tobacco-houses and cellars; and artificial niter-beds were made\r\nto provide for prospective wants. Of soft wood for charcoal there was\r\nabundance, and thus materials were procured for the manufacture of\r\ngunpowder to meet the demand which would arise when the limited quantity\r\npurchased by the Confederate Government at the North should be\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nIt was our good fortune to secure the services of an able and scientific\r\nsoldier, General G. W. Rains, who, to a military education, added\r\nexperience in a large manufacturing establishment, and to him was\r\nconfided the construction of a powder-mill, and the manufacture of\r\npowder, both for artillery and small-arms. The appalling contemplation\r\nof the inauguration of a great war, without powder or a navy to secure\r\nits importation from abroad, was soon relieved by the extraordinary\r\nefforts of the ordnance department and the well-directed skill of\r\nGeneral Rains, to whom it is but a just tribute to say that, beginning\r\nwithout even instructed workmen, he had, before the close of the war,\r\nmade what, in the opinion of competent judges, has been pronounced to be\r\nthe best powder-mill in the world, and in which powder of every variety\r\nof grain was manufactured of materials which had been purified from\r\nthose qualities which cause its deterioration under long exposure to a\r\nmoist atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe avowed purpose and declared obligation of the Federal Government was\r\nto occupy and possess the property belonging to the United States, yet\r\none of the first acts was to set fire to the armory at Harper's Ferry,\r\nVirginia, the only establishment of the kind in the Southern States, and\r\nthe only Southern depository of the rifles which the General Government\r\nhad then on hand.\r\n\r\nWhat conclusion is to be drawn from such action? To avoid attributing a\r\nbreach of solemn pledges, it must be supposed that Virginia was\r\nconsidered as out of the Union, and a public enemy, in whose borders it\r\nwas proper to destroy whatever might be useful to her of the common\r\nproperty of the States lately united.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the United States troops had evacuated the place, the\r\ncitizens and armorers went to work to save the armory as far as possible\r\nfrom destruction, and to secure valuable material stored in it. The\r\nmaster armorer, Armistead Ball, so bravely and skillfully directed these\r\nefforts, that a large part of the machinery and materials was saved from\r\nthe flames. The subduing of the fire was a dangerous and difficult task,\r\nand great credit is due to those who, under the orders of Master Armorer\r\nBall, attempted and achieved it. When the fire was extinguished, the\r\nwork was continued and persevered in until all the valuable machinery\r\nand material had been collected, boxed, and shipped to Richmond, about\r\nthe end of the summer of 1861. The machinery thus secured was divided\r\nbetween the arsenals at Richmond, Virginia, and Fayetteville, North\r\nCarolina, and, when repaired and put in working condition, supplied to\r\nsome extent the want which existed in the South of means for the\r\nalteration and repair of old or injured arms, and finally contributed to\r\nincrease the very scanty supply of arms with which our country was\r\nfurnished when the war began. The practice of the Federal Government,\r\nwhich had kept the construction and manufacture of the material of war\r\nat the North, had consequently left the South without the requisite\r\nnumber of skilled workmen by whose labor machinery could at once be made\r\nfully effective if it were obtained; indeed, the want of such employees\r\nprevented the small amount of machinery on hand from being worked to its\r\nfull capacity. The gallant Master Armorer Ball, whose capacity, zeal,\r\nand fidelity deserve more than a passing notice, was sent with that part\r\nof the machinery assigned to the Fayetteville Arsenal. The toil, the\r\nanxiety, and responsibility of his perilous position at Harper's Ferry,\r\nwhere he remained long after the protecting force of the Confederate\r\narmy retired, had probably undermined a constitution so vigorous that,\r\nin the face of a great exigency, no labor seemed too great or too long\r\nfor him to grapple with and endure. So, like a ship which, after having\r\nweathered the storm, goes down in the calm, the master armorer, soon\r\nafter he took his quiet post at Fayetteville, was \"found dead in his\r\nbed.\"\r\n\r\nThe difficulties which on every side met the several departments of the\r\nexecutive branch of the Government one must suppose were but little\r\nappreciated by many, whose opportunities for exact observation were the\r\nbest, as one often meets with self-complacent expressions as to modes of\r\nachieving readily what prompt, patient, zealous effort proved to be\r\ninsurmountable. In the progress of this work, it is hoped, will be\r\npresented not only the magnitude of the obstacles, but the spirit and\r\ncapacity with which they were encountered by the unseen and much\r\nundervalued labors of the officers of the several departments, on whom\r\ndevolved provision for the civil service, as well as for the armies in\r\nthe field. Already has the report of General St. John, Commissary-\r\nGeneral of Subsistence, of the operations of that department, just\r\nbefore the close of the war, exposed the hollowness of many sensational\r\npictures intended to fix gross neglect or utter incapacity on the\r\nExecutive.\r\n\r\nThe hoped-for and expected monograms of other chiefs of bureaus will\r\nsilence like criticisms on each, so far as they are made by those who\r\nare not willfully blind, or maliciously intent on the circulation of\r\nfalsehood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    The Proclamation for Seventy-five Thousand Men by President\r\n    Lincoln further examined.--The Reasons presented by him to\r\n    Mankind for the Justification of his Conduct shown to be Mere\r\n    Fictions, having no Relation to the Question.--What is the Value\r\n    of Constitutional Liberty, of Bills of Rights, of Limitations of\r\n    Powers, if they may be transgressed at Pleasure?--Secession of\r\n    South Carolina.--Proclamation of Blockade.--Session of Congress\r\n    at Montgomery.--Extracts from the President's Message.--Acts of\r\n    Congress.--Spirit of the People.--Secession of Border\r\n    States.--Destruction of United States Property by Order of\r\n    President Lincoln.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any further evidence had been required to show that it was the\r\ndetermination of the Northern people not only to make no concessions to\r\nthe grievances of the Southern States, but to increase them to the last\r\nextremity, it was furnished by the proclamation of President Lincoln,\r\nissued on April 15, 1861. This proclamation, which has already been\r\nmentioned, requires a further examination, as it was the official\r\ndeclaration, on the part of the Government of the United States, of the\r\nwar which ensued. In it the President called for seventy-five thousand\r\nmen to suppress \"combinations\" opposed to the laws, and obstructing\r\ntheir execution in seven sovereign States which had retired from the\r\nUnion. Seventy-five thousand men organized and equipped are a powerful\r\narmy, and, when raised to operate against these States, nothing else\r\nthan war could be intended. The words in which he summoned this force\r\nwere these: \"Whereas the laws of the United States have been for some\r\ntime past, and now are, opposed, and the execution thereof obstructed,\r\nin the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi,\r\nLouisiana, and Texas, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by\r\nthe ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in\r\nthe marshals by law: Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, by virtue of\r\nthe power in me vested by the Constitution and laws,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe power granted in the Constitution is thus expressed: \"The Congress\r\nshall have power to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the\r\nlaws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.\"[169] It\r\nwas to the Congress, not the Executive, to whom the power was delegated,\r\nand thus early was commenced a long series of usurpations of powers\r\ninconsistent with the purposes for which the Union was formed, and\r\ndestructive of the fraternity it was designed to perpetuate.\r\n\r\nOn November 6, 1860, the Legislature of South Carolina assembled and\r\ngave the vote of the State for electors of a President of the United\r\nStates. On the next day an act was passed calling a State Convention to\r\nassemble on December 17th, to determine the question of the withdrawal\r\nof the State from the United States. Candidates for membership were\r\nimmediately nominated. All were in favor of secession. The Convention\r\nassembled on December 17th, and on the 20th passed \"an ordinance to\r\ndissolve the union between the State of South Carolina and other States\r\nunited with her under the compact entitled 'The Constitution of the\r\nUnited States of America.'\" The ordinance began with these words: \"We,\r\nthe people of the State of South Carolina, in convention assembled, do\r\ndeclare and ordain,\" etc. The State authorities immediately conformed to\r\nthis action of the Convention, and the laws and authority of the United\r\nStates ceased to be obeyed within the limits of the State. About four\r\nmonths afterward, when the State, in union with others which had joined\r\nher, had possessed herself of the forts within her limits, which the\r\nUnited States Government had refused to evacuate, President Lincoln\r\nissued the above-mentioned proclamation.\r\n\r\nThe State of South Carolina is designated in the proclamation as a\r\ncombination too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of\r\njudicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in the marshals by law.\r\nThis designation does not recognize the State, or manifest any\r\nconsciousness of its existence, whereas South Carolina was one of the\r\ncolonies that had declared her independence, and, after a long and\r\nbloody war, she had been recognized as a sovereign State by Great\r\nBritain, the only power to which she had ever owed allegiance. The fact\r\nthat she had been one of the colonies in the original Congress, had been\r\na member of the Confederation, and subsequently of the Union,\r\nstrengthens, but surely can not impair, her claim to be a State. Though\r\nPresident Lincoln designated her as a \"combination,\" it did not make her\r\na combination. Though he refused to recognize her as a State, it did not\r\nmake her any less a State. By assertion, he attempted to annihilate\r\nseven States; and the war which followed was to enforce the\r\nrevolutionary edict, and to establish the supremacy of the General\r\nGovernment on the ruins of the blood-bought independence of the States.\r\n\r\nBy designating the State as a \"combination,\" and considering that under\r\nsuch a name it might be in a condition of insurrection, he assumed to\r\nhave authority to raise a great military force and attack the State.\r\nYet, even if the fact had been as assumed, if an insurrection had\r\nexisted, the President could not lawfully have derived the power he\r\nexercised from such condition of affairs. The provision of the\r\nConstitution is as follows: \"The United States shall guarantee to every\r\nState in this Union a republican form of government, and shall protect\r\neach of them against invasion; and, on application of the Legislature,\r\nor of the Executive (when the Legislature can not be convened), against\r\ndomestic violence.\"[170] So the guarantee availed not at all to justify\r\nthe act which it was presented to excuse--the fact being that a State,\r\nand not an \"unlawful combination,\" as asserted, was the object of\r\nassault, and the case one of making war. For a State or union of States\r\nto attack with military force another State, is to make war. By the\r\nConstitution, the power to make war is given solely to Congress.\r\n\"Congress shall have power to declare war,\" says the Constitution.[171]\r\nAnd, again, \"to raise and support armies.\"[172] Thus, under a perverted\r\nuse of language, the Executive at Washington did that which he\r\nundeniably had no power to do, under a faithful observance of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nTo justify himself to Congress and the people, or, rather, before the\r\nface of mankind, for this evasion of the Constitution of his country,\r\nPresident Lincoln, in his message to Congress, of July 4, 1861, resorted\r\nto the artifice of saying, \"It [meaning the proceedings of the\r\nConfederate States] presents to the whole family of man the question\r\nwhether a constitutional republic or democracy--a government of the\r\npeople by the same people--can, or can not, maintain its territorial\r\nintegrity against its own domestic foes?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question is very plain. In the nature of things, no\r\nunion can be formed except by separate, independent, and distinct\r\nparties. Any other combination is not a union; and, upon the destruction\r\nof any of these elements in the parties, the union _ipso facto_ ceases.\r\nIf the Government is the result of a union of States, then these States\r\nmust be separate, sovereign, and distinct, to be able to form a union,\r\nwhich is entirely an act of their own volition. Such a government as\r\nours had no power to maintain its existence any longer than the\r\ncontracting parties pleased to cohere, because it was founded on the\r\ngreat principle of voluntary federation, and organized \"to establish\r\njustice and insure domestic tranquillity.\"[173] Any departure from this\r\nprinciple by the General Government not only perverts and destroys its\r\nnature, but furnishes a just cause to the injured State to withdraw from\r\nthe union. A new union might subsequently be formed, but the original\r\none could never by coercion be restored. Any effort on the part of the\r\nothers to force the seceding State to consent to come back is an attempt\r\nat subjugation. It is a wrong which no lapse of time or combination of\r\ncircumstances can ever make right. A forced union is a political\r\nabsurdity. No less absurd is President Lincoln's effort to dissever the\r\nsovereignty of the people from that of the State; as if there could be a\r\nState without a people, or a sovereign people without a State.\r\n\r\nBut the question which Mr. Lincoln presents \"to the whole family of man\"\r\ndeserves a further notice. The answer which he seems to infer would be\r\ngiven \"by the whole family of man\" is that such a government as he\r\nsupposes \"can maintain its territorial integrity against its own\r\ndomestic foes.\" And, therefore, he concluded that he was right in the\r\njudgment of \"the whole family of man\" in commencing hostilities against\r\nus. He says, \"So viewing the issue, no choice was left but to call out\r\nthe war power of the Government.\" That is the power to make war against\r\nforeign nations, for the Government has no other war power. Planting\r\nhimself on this position, he commenced the devastation and bloodshed\r\nwhich followed to effect our subjugation.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more erroneous than such views. The supposed case which\r\nhe presents is entirely unlike the real case. The Government of the\r\nUnited States is like no other government. It is neither a\r\n\"constitutional republic or democracy,\" nor has it ever been thus\r\ncalled. Neither is it a \"government of the people by the same people\";\r\nbut it is known and designated as \"the Government of the United States.\"\r\nIt is an anomaly among governments. Its authority consists solely of\r\ncertain powers delegated to it, as a common agent, by an association of\r\nsovereign and independent States. These powers are to be exercised only\r\nfor certain specified objects; and the purposes, declared in the\r\nbeginning of the deed or instrument of delegation, were \"to form a more\r\nperfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide\r\nfor the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the\r\nblessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\"\r\n\r\nThe beginning and the end of all the powers of the Government of the\r\nUnited States are to be found in that instrument of delegation. All its\r\npowers are there expressed, defined, and limited. It was only to that\r\ninstrument Mr. Lincoln as President should have gone to learn his\r\nduties. That was the chart which he had just solemnly pledged himself to\r\nthe country faithfully to follow. He soon deviated widely from it--and\r\nfatally erroneous was his course. The administration of the affairs of a\r\ngreat people, at a most perilous period, is decided by the answer which\r\nit is assumed \"the whole family of man\" would give to a supposed\r\ncondition of human affairs which did not exist and which could not\r\nexist. This is the ground upon which the rectitude of his cause was\r\nplaced. He says, \"No choice was left but to call out the war power of\r\nthe Government, and so to resist force employed for its destruction by\r\nforce for its preservation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" he says, \"no choice was left but to call out the war power of\r\nthe Government.\" For what purpose must he call out this war power? He\r\nanswers, by saying, \"and so to resist force employed for its destruction\r\nby force for its preservation.\" But this which he asserts is not a fact.\r\nThere was no \"force employed for its destruction.\" Let the reader turn\r\nto the record of the facts in Part III of this work, and peruse the\r\nfruitless efforts for peace which were made by us, and which Mr. Lincoln\r\ndid not deign to notice. The assertion is not only incorrect, in stating\r\nthat force was employed by us, but also in declaring that it was for the\r\ndestruction of the Government of the United States. On the contrary, we\r\nwished to leave it alone. Our separation did not involve its\r\ndestruction. To such fiction was Mr. Lincoln compelled to resort to give\r\neven apparent justice to his cause. He now goes to the Constitution for\r\nthe exercise of his war power, and here we have another fiction.\r\n\r\nOn April 19th, four days later, President Lincoln issued another\r\nproclamation, announcing a blockade of the ports of seven confederated\r\nStates, which was afterward extended to North Carolina and Virginia. It\r\nfurther declared that all persons who should under their authority\r\nmolest any vessel of the United States, or the persons or cargo on\r\nboard, should be treated as pirates. In their efforts to subjugate us,\r\nthe destruction of our commerce was regarded by the authorities at\r\nWashington as a most efficient measure. It was early seen that, although\r\nacts of Congress established ports of entry where commerce existed, they\r\nmight be repealed, and the ports nominally closed or declared to be\r\nclosed; yet such a declaration would be of no avail unless sustained by\r\na naval force, as these ports were located in territory not subject to\r\nthe United States. An act was subsequently passed authorizing the\r\nPresident of the United States, in his discretion, to close our ports,\r\nbut it was never executed.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of blockade was resorted to, and a falsehood was asserted on\r\nwhich to base it. Mr. Seward writes to Mr. Dallas: \"You will say (to\r\nLord John Russell) that, by our own laws and the laws of nature and the\r\nlaws of nations, this Government has a clear right to suppress\r\ninsurrection. An exclusion of commerce from national ports which have\r\nbeen seized by insurgents, in the equitable form of blockade, is a\r\nproper means to that end.\"[174] This is the same doctrine of\r\n\"combinations\" fabricated by the authorities at Washington to serve as\r\nthe basis of a bloody revolution. Under the laws of nations, separate\r\ngovernments when at war blockade each other's ports. This is decided to\r\nbe justifiable. But the Government of the United States could not\r\nconsent to justify its blockade of our ports on this ground, as it would\r\nbe an admission that the Confederate States were a separate and distinct\r\nsovereignty, and that the war was prosecuted only for subjugation. It,\r\ntherefore, assumed that the withdrawal of the Southern States from the\r\nUnion was an insurrection.\r\n\r\nWas it an insurrection? When certain sovereign and independent States\r\nform a union with limited powers for some general purposes, and any one\r\nor more of them, in the progress of time, suffer unjust and oppressive\r\ngrievances for which there is no redress but in a withdrawal from the\r\nassociation, is such withdrawal an insurrection? If so, then of what\r\nadvantage is a compact of union to States? Within the Union are\r\noppressions and grievances; and the attempt to go out brings war and\r\nsubjugation. The ambitious and aggressive States obtain possession of\r\nthe central authority which, having grown strong in the lapse of time,\r\nasserts its entire sovereignty over the States. Whichever of them denies\r\nit and seeks to retire, is declared to be guilty of insurrection, its\r\ncitizens are stigmatized as \"rebels,\" as if they had revolted against a\r\nmaster, and a war of subjugation is begun. If this action is once\r\ntolerated, where will it end? Where is the value of constitutional\r\nliberty? What strength is there in bills of rights--in limitations of\r\npower? What new hope for mankind is to be found in written\r\nconstitutions, what remedy which did not exist under kings or emperors?\r\nIf the doctrines thus announced by the Government of the United States\r\nare conceded, then, look through either end of the political telescope,\r\nand one sees only an empire, and the once famous Declaration of\r\nIndependence trodden in the dust as a \"glittering generality,\" and the\r\ncompact of union denounced as a \"flaunting lie.\" Those who submit to\r\nsuch consequences without resistance are not worthy of the liberties and\r\nthe rights to which they were born, and deserve to be made slaves. Such\r\nmust be the verdict of mankind.\r\n\r\nMen do not fight to make a fraternal union, neither do nations. These\r\nmilitary preparations of the Government of the United States signified\r\nnothing less than the subjugation of the Southern States, so that, by\r\none devastating blow, the North might grasp for ever that supremacy it\r\nhad so long coveted.\r\n\r\nTo be prepared for self-defense, I called Congress together at\r\nMontgomery on April 29th, and, in the message of that date, thus spoke\r\nof the proclamation of the President of the United States: \"Apparently\r\ncontradictory as are the terms of this singular document, one point is\r\nunmistakably evident. The President of the United States calls for an\r\narmy of seventy-five thousand men, whose first service is to be the\r\ncapture of our forts. It is a plain declaration of war, which I am not\r\nat liberty to disregard, because of my knowledge that, under the\r\nConstitution of the United States, the President is usurping a power\r\ngranted exclusively to Congress.\"\r\n\r\nI then proceeded to say that I did not feel at liberty to disregard the\r\nfact that many of the States seemed quite content to submit to the\r\nexercise of the powers assumed by the President of the United States,\r\nand were actively engaged in levying troops for the purpose indicated in\r\nthe proclamation. Meantime, being deprived of the aid of Congress, I had\r\nbeen under the necessity of confining my action to a call on the States\r\nfor volunteers for the common defense, in accordance with authority\r\npreviously conferred on me. I stated that there were then in the field,\r\nat Charleston, Pensacola, Forts Morgan, Jackson, St. Philip, and\r\nPulaski, nineteen thousand men, and sixteen thousand more were on their\r\nway to Virginia; that it was proposed to organize and hold in readiness\r\nfor instant action, in view of the existing exigencies of the country,\r\nan army of one hundred thousand men; and that, if a further force should\r\nbe needed, Congress would be appealed to for authority to call it into\r\nthe field. Finally, that the intent of the President of the United\r\nStates, already developed, to invade our soil, capture our forts,\r\nblockade our ports, and wage war against us, rendered it necessary to\r\nraise means to a much larger amount than had been done, to defray the\r\nexpenses of maintaining independence and repelling invasion.\r\n\r\nA brief summary of the internal affairs of the Government followed, and,\r\nnotwithstanding frequent declarations of the peaceful intentions of the\r\nwithdrawing States had been made in the most solemn manner, it was\r\ndeemed not to be out of place to repeat them once more; and, therefore,\r\nthe message closed with these words: \"We protest solemnly, in the face\r\nof mankind, that we desire peace at any sacrifice, save that of honor.\r\nIn independence we seek no conquest, no aggrandizement, no concession of\r\nany kind from the States with which we have lately been confederated.\r\nAll we ask is to be let alone--that those who never held power over us\r\nshall not now attempt our subjugation by arms. This we will, we must,\r\nresist to the direst extremity. The moment that this pretension is\r\nabandoned, the sword will drop from our grasp, and we shall be ready to\r\nenter into treaties of amity and commerce that can not but be mutually\r\nbeneficial. So long as this pretension is maintained, with a firm\r\nreliance on that Divine Power which covers with its protection the just\r\ncause, we must continue to struggle for our inherent right to freedom,\r\nindependence, and self-government.\"\r\n\r\nAt this session Congress passed acts authorizing the President to use\r\nthe whole land and naval force to meet the necessities of the war thus\r\ncommenced; to issue to private armed vessels letters of marque; in\r\naddition to the volunteer force authorized to be raised, to accept the\r\nservices of volunteers, to serve during the war; to receive into the\r\nservice various companies of the different arms; to make a loan of fifty\r\nmillions of dollars in bonds and notes; and to hold an election for\r\nofficers of the permanent Government under the new Constitution. An act\r\nwas also passed to provide revenue from imports; another, relative to\r\nprisoners of war; and such others as were necessary to complete the\r\ninternal organization of the Government, and establish the\r\nadministration of public affairs.\r\n\r\nIn every portion of the country there was exhibited the most patriotic\r\ndevotion to the common cause. Transportation companies freely tendered\r\nthe use of their lines for troops and supplies. Requisitions for troops\r\nwere met with such alacrity that the number offering their services in\r\nevery instance greatly exceeded the demand and the ability to arm them.\r\nMen of the highest official and social position served as volunteers in\r\nthe ranks. The gravity of age and the zeal of youth rivaled each other\r\nin the desire to be foremost in the public defense.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the proclamation of the President of the United\r\nStates, calling out seventy-five thousand men, was followed by the\r\nimmediate withdrawal of the States of Virginia, North Carolina,\r\nTennessee, and Arkansas, and their union with the Confederate States.\r\nThe former State, thus placed on the frontier and exposed to invasion,\r\nbegan to prepare for a resolute defense. Volunteers were ordered to be\r\nenrolled and held in readiness in every part of the State. Colonel\r\nRobert E. Lee, having resigned his commission in the United States\r\ncavalry, was on April 22d nominated and confirmed by the State\r\nConvention of Virginia as \"Commander-in-Chief of the military and naval\r\nforces of the Commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nAlready the Northern officer in charge had evacuated Harper's Ferry,\r\nafter having attempted to destroy the public buildings there. His report\r\nsays: \"I gave the order to apply the torch. In three minutes or less,\r\nboth of the arsenal buildings, containing nearly fifteen thousand stand\r\nof arms, together with the carpenter's shop, which was at the upper end\r\nof a long and connected series of workshops of the armory proper, were\r\nin a blaze. There is every reason for believing the destruction was\r\ncomplete.\" Mr. Simon Cameron, the Secretary of War, on April 22d replied\r\nto this report in these words: \"I am directed by the President of the\r\nUnited States to communicate to you, and through you to the officers and\r\nmen under your command at Harper's Ferry Armory, the approbation of the\r\nGovernment of your and their judicious conduct there, and to tender you\r\nand them the thanks of the Government for the same.\" At the same time\r\nthe ship-yard at Norfolk was abandoned after an attempt to destroy it.\r\nAbout midnight of April 20th, a fire was started in the yard, which\r\ncontinued to increase, and before daylight the work of destruction\r\nextended to two immense ship-houses, one of which contained the entire\r\nframe of a seventy-four-gun ship, and to the long ranges of stores and\r\noffices on each side of the entrance. The great ship Pennsylvania was\r\nburned, and the frigates Merrimac and Columbus, and the Delaware,\r\nRaritan, Plymouth, and Germantown were sunk. A vast amount of machinery,\r\nvaluable engines, small-arms, and chronometers, was broken up and\r\nrendered entirely useless. The value of the property destroyed was\r\nestimated at several millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThis property thus destroyed had been accumulated and constructed with\r\nlaborious care and skillful ingenuity during a course of years to\r\nfulfill one of the objects of the Constitution, which was expressed in\r\nthese words, \"To provide for the common defense\" (see Preamble of the\r\nConstitution). It had belonged to all the States in common, and to each\r\none equally with the others. If the Confederate States were still\r\nmembers of the Union, as the President of the United States asserted,\r\nwhere can he find a justification of these acts?\r\n\r\nIn explanation of his policy to the Commissioners sent to him by the\r\nVirginia State Convention, he said, referring to his inaugural address,\r\n\"As I then and therein said, I now repeat, the power confided in me will\r\nbe used to hold, occupy, and possess property and places belonging to\r\nthe Government.\" Yet he tendered the thanks of the Government to those\r\nwho applied the torch to destroy this property belonging, as he regarded\r\nit, to the Government.\r\n\r\nHow unreasonable, how blind with rage must have been that administration\r\nof affairs which so quickly brought the Government to the necessity of\r\ndestroying its own means of defense in order, as it publicly declared,\r\n\"to maintain its life\"! It would seem as if the passions that rule the\r\nsavage had taken possession of the authorities at the United States\r\ncapital! In the conflagrations of vast structures, the wanton\r\ndestruction of public property, and still more in the issue of _lettres\r\nde cachet_ by the Secretary of State, who boasted of the power of his\r\nlittle bell over the personal liberties of the citizen, the people saw,\r\nor might have seen, the rapid strides toward despotism made under the\r\nmask of preserving the Union. Yet these and similar measures were\r\ntolerated because the sectional hate dominated in the Northern States\r\nover the higher motives of constitutional and moral obligation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: Constitution of the United States, Article I, section 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: Constitution of the United States, Article IV, section\r\n4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: Article I, section 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: Constitution of the United States, preamble.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: Diplomatic correspondence, May 21, 1861.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n    Maryland first approached by Northern Invasion.--Denies to\r\n    United States Troops the Right of Way across her\r\n    Domain.--Mission of Judge Handy.--Views of Governor Hicks.--His\r\n    Proclamation.--Arrival of Massachusetts Troops at\r\n    Baltimore.--Passage through the City disputed.--Activity of the\r\n    Police.--Burning of Bridges.--Letter of President Lincoln to the\r\n    Governor.--Visited by Citizens.--Action of the State\r\n    Legislature.--Occupation of the Relay House.--The City Arms\r\n    surrendered.--City in Possession of United States\r\n    Troops.--Remonstrances of the City to the Passage of Troops\r\n    disregarded.--Citizens arrested; also, Members of the\r\n    Legislature.--Accumulation of Northern Forces at\r\n    Washington.--Invasion of West Virginia by a Force under\r\n    McClellan.--Attack at Philippi; at Laurel Hill.--Death of\r\n    General Garnett.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe border State of Maryland was the outpost of the South on the\r\nfrontier first to be approached by Northern invasion. The first\r\ndemonstration against State sovereignty was to be made there, and in her\r\nfate were the other slaveholding States of the border to have warning of\r\nwhat they were to expect. She had chosen to be, for the time at least,\r\nneutral in the impending war, and had denied to the United States troops\r\nthe right of way across her domain in their march to invade the Southern\r\nStates. The Governor (Hicks) avowed a desire, not only that the State\r\nshould avoid war, but that she should be a means for pacifying those\r\nmore disposed to engage in combat.\r\n\r\nJudge Handy, a distinguished citizen of Mississippi, who was born in\r\nMaryland, had, in December, 1860, been sent as a commissioner from the\r\nState of his adoption to that of his birth, and presented his views and\r\nthe object of his mission to Governor Hicks, who, in his response\r\n(December 19, 1860), declared his purpose to act in full concert with\r\nthe other border States, adding, \"I do not doubt the people of Maryland\r\nare ready to go with the people of those States for weal or woe.\"[175]\r\nSubsequently, in answer to appeals for and against a proclamation\r\nassembling the Legislature, in order to have a call for a State\r\nconvention, Governor Hicks issued an address, in which, arguing that\r\nthere was no necessity to define the position of Maryland, he wrote: \"If\r\nthe action of the Legislature would be simply to declare that Maryland\r\nwas with the South in sympathy and feeling; that she demands from the\r\nNorth the repeal of offensive, unconstitutional statutes, and appeals to\r\nit for new guarantees; that she will wait a reasonable time for the\r\nNorth to purge her statute-books, to do justice to her Southern\r\nbrethren; and, if her appeals are vain, will make common cause with her\r\nsister border States in resistance to tyranny, if need be, it would only\r\nbe saying what the whole country well knows,\" etc.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of April, 1861, Governor Hicks issued a proclamation\r\ninvoking them to preserve the peace, and said, \"I assure the people that\r\nno troops will be sent from Maryland, unless it may be for the defense\r\nof the national capital.\" On the same day Mayor Brown, of the city of\r\nBaltimore, issued a proclamation in which, referring to that of the\r\nGovernor above cited, he said, \"I can not withhold my expression of\r\nsatisfaction at his resolution that no troops shall be sent from\r\nMaryland to the soil of any other State.\" It will be remembered that the\r\ncapital was on a site which originally belonged to Maryland, and was\r\nceded by her for a special use, so that troops to defend the capital\r\nmight be considered as not having been sent out of Maryland. It will be\r\nremembered that these proclamations were three days after the\r\nrequisition made by the Secretary of War on the States which had not\r\nseceded for their quota of troops to serve in the war about to be\r\ninaugurated against the South, and that rumors existed at the time in\r\nBaltimore that troops from the Northeast were about to be sent through\r\nthat city toward the South. On the next day, viz., the 19th of April,\r\n1861, a body of troops arrived at the railroad depot; the citizens\r\nassembled in large numbers, and, though without arms, disputed the\r\npassage through the city. They attacked the troops with the loose stones\r\nfound in the street, which was undergoing repair, and with such\r\ndetermination and violence, that some of the soldiers were wounded, and\r\nthey fired upon the multitude, killing a few and wounding many.\r\n\r\nThe police of Baltimore were very active in their efforts to prevent\r\nconflict and preserve the peace; they rescued the baggage and munitions\r\nof the troops, which had been seized by the multitude; and the rear\r\nportion of the troops was, by direction of Governor Hicks, sent back to\r\nthe borders of the State. The troops who had got through the city took\r\nthe railroad at the Southern Depot and passed on. The militia of the\r\ncity was called out, and by evening quiet was restored. During the\r\nnight, on a report that more Northern troops were approaching the city\r\nby the railroads, the bridges nearest to the city were destroyed, as it\r\nwas understood, by orders from the authorities of Baltimore.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of April President Lincoln wrote in reply to Governor Hicks\r\nand Mayor Brown, saying, \"For the future, troops must be brought here,\r\nbut I make no point of bringing them through Baltimore.\" On the next\r\nday, the 21st, Mayor Brown and other influential citizens, by request of\r\nthe President, visited him. The interview took place in presence of the\r\nCabinet and General Scott, and was reported to the public by the Mayor\r\nafter his return to Baltimore. From that report I make the following\r\nextracts. Referring to the President, the Mayor uses the following\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n    \"The protection of Washington, he asseverated with great\r\n    earnestness, was the sole object of concentrating troops there,\r\n    and he protested that none of the troops brought through\r\n    Maryland were intended for any purposes hostile to the State, or\r\n    aggressive as against the Southern States.... He called on\r\n    General Scott for his opinion, which the General gave at great\r\n    length, to the effect that troops might be brought through\r\n    Maryland without going through Baltimore, etc.... The interview\r\n    terminated with the distinct assurance, on the part of the\r\n    President, that no more troops would be sent through Baltimore,\r\n    unless obstructed in their transit in other directions, and with\r\n    the understanding that the city authorities should do their best\r\n    to restrain their own people.\r\n\r\n    \"The Mayor and his companions availed themselves of the\r\n    President's full discussion of the questions of the day to urge\r\n    upon him respectfully, but in the most earnest manner, a course\r\n    of policy which would give peace to the country, and especially\r\n    the withdrawal of all orders contemplating the passage of troops\r\n    through any part of Maryland.\"\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of the State of Maryland appointed commissioners to the\r\nConfederate Government to suggest to it the cessation of impending\r\nhostilities until the meeting of Congress at Washington in July.\r\nCommissioners with like instructions were also sent to Washington. In my\r\nreply to the Commissioners, dated 25th of May, 1861, I referred to the\r\nuniform expression of desire for peace on the part of the Confederate\r\nGovernment, and added:\r\n\r\n    \"In deference to the State of Maryland, it again asserts in the\r\n    most emphatic terms that its sincere and earnest desire is for\r\n    peace; but that, while the Government would readily entertain\r\n    any proposition from the Government of the United States tending\r\n    to a peaceful solution of the present difficulties, the recent\r\n    attempts of this Government to enter into negotiations with that\r\n    of the United States were attended with results which forbid any\r\n    renewal of proposals from it to that Government.... Its policy\r\n    can not but be peace--peace with all nations and people.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of May, the Relay House, at the junction of the Washington\r\nand Baltimore and Ohio Railroads, was occupied by United States troops\r\nunder General Butler, and, on the 13th of the same month, he moved a\r\nportion of the troops to Baltimore, and took position on Federal\r\nHill--thus was consummated the military occupation of Baltimore. On the\r\nnext day, reënforcements were received; and, on the same day, the\r\ncommanding General issued a proclamation to the citizens, in which he\r\nannounced to them his purpose and authority to discriminate between\r\ncitizens, those who agreed with him being denominated \"well disposed,\"\r\nand the others described with many offensive epithets. The initiatory\r\nstep of the policy subsequently developed was found in one sentence:\r\n\"Therefore, all manufacturers of arms and munitions of war are hereby\r\nrequested to report to me forthwith, so that the lawfulness of their\r\noccupations may be known and understood, and all misconstruction of\r\ntheir doings avoided.\"\r\n\r\nThere soon followed a demand for the surrender of the arms stored by the\r\ncity authorities in a warehouse. The police refused to surrender them\r\nwithout the orders of the police commissioners. The police\r\ncommissioners, upon representation that the demand of General Butler was\r\nby order of the President, decided to surrender the arms under protest,\r\nand they were accordingly removed to Fort McHenry.\r\n\r\nBaltimore was now disarmed. The Army of the United States had control of\r\nthe city. There was no longer necessity to regard the remonstrance of\r\nBaltimore against sending troops through the city, and that more\r\nconvenient route was henceforth to be employed. George P. Kane, Marshal\r\nof the Police of Baltimore, who had rendered most efficient service for\r\nthe preservation of peace, as well in the city of Baltimore as at Locust\r\nPoint, where troops were disembarked to be dispatched to Washington, was\r\narrested at home by a military force, and sent to Fort McHenry, and a\r\nprovost-marshal was appointed by General Banks, who had succeeded to the\r\ncommand. The excuse given for the arrest of Marshal Kane was that he was\r\nbelieved to be cognizant of combinations of men waiting for an\r\nopportunity to unite with those in rebellion against the United States\r\nGovernment. Whether the suspicion were well or ill founded, it\r\nconstituted a poor excuse for depriving a citizen of his liberty without\r\nlegal warrant and without proof. But this was only the beginning of\r\nunbridled despotism and a reign of terror. The Mayor and Police\r\nCommissioners, Charles Howard, William H. Gatchell, and John W. Davis,\r\nheld a meeting, and, after preparing a protest against the suspension of\r\ntheir functions in the appointment of a provost-marshall, resolved that,\r\nwhile they would do nothing to \"obstruct the execution of such measures\r\nas Major-General Banks may deem proper to take, on his own\r\nresponsibility, for the preservation of the peace of the city and of\r\npublic order, they can not, consistently with their views of official\r\nduty and of the obligations of their oaths of office, recognize the\r\nright of any of the officers and men of the police force, as such, to\r\nreceive orders or directions from any other authority than from this\r\nBoard; and that, in the opinion of the Board, the forcible suspension of\r\ntheir functions suspends at the same time the active operations of the\r\npolice law.\"[176] The Provost-Marshal, with the plenary powers conferred\r\nupon him, commenced a system of search and seizure, in private houses,\r\nof arms and munitions of every description.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of July, General Banks announced that, \"in pursuance of\r\norders issued from the headquarters at Washington for the preservation\r\nof the public peace in this department, I have arrested, and do detain\r\nin custody of the United States, the late members of the Board of\r\nPolice--Messrs. Charles Howard, William H. Gatchell, Charles D. Hinks,\r\nand John W. Davis.\" If the object had been to preserve order by any\r\nproper and legitimate method, the effective means would palpably have\r\nbeen to rely upon men whose influence was known to be great, and whose\r\nintegrity was certainly unquestionable. The first-named of the\r\ncommissioners I knew well. He was of an old Maryland family, honored for\r\ntheir public services, and himself adorned by every social virtue. Old,\r\nunambitious, hospitable, gentle, loving, he was beloved by the people\r\namong whom his long life had been passed. Could such a man be the just\r\nobject of suspicion, if, when laws had been silenced, suspicion could\r\njustify arrest and imprisonment? Those who knew him will accept as a\r\njust description:\r\n\r\n  \"In action faithful, and in honor clear,\r\n  Who broke no promise, served no private end,\r\n  Who gained no title, and who lost no friend.\"\r\n\r\nThenceforward, arrests of the most illustrious became the rule. In a\r\nland where freedom of speech was held to be an unquestioned right,\r\nfreedom of thought ceased to exist, and men were incarcerated for\r\nopinion's sake.\r\n\r\nIn the Maryland Legislature, the Hon. S. Teacle Wallis, from a committee\r\nto whom was referred the memorial of the police commissioners arrested\r\nin Baltimore, made a report upon the unconstitutionality of the act, and\r\n\"appealed in the most earnest manner to the whole people of the country,\r\nof all parties, sections, and opinions, to take warnings by the\r\nusurpations mentioned, and come to the rescue of the free institutions\r\nof the country.\"[177]\r\n\r\nFor no better reason, so far as the public was informed, than a vote in\r\nfavor of certain resolutions, General Banks sent his provost-marshal to\r\nFrederick, where the Legislature was in session; a cordon of pickets was\r\nplaced around the town to prevent any one from leaving it without a\r\nwritten permission from a member of General Banks's staff; police\r\ndetectives from Baltimore then went into the town and arrested some\r\ntwelve or thirteen members and several officers of the Legislature,\r\nwhich, thereby left without a quorum, was prevented from organizing, and\r\nit performed the only act which it was competent to do, i.e., adjourned.\r\nS. Teacle Wallis, the author of the report in defense of the\r\nconstitutional rights of citizens, was among those arrested. Henry May,\r\na member of Congress, who had introduced a resolution which he hoped\r\nwould be promotive of peace, was another of those arrested and thrown\r\ninto prison. Senator Kennedy, of the same State, presented a report of\r\nthe Legislature to the United States Senate, reciting the outrage\r\ninflicted upon Maryland in the persons of her municipal officers and\r\ncitizens, and, after some opposition, merely obtained an order to have\r\nit printed. Governor Hicks, whose promises had been so cheering in the\r\nbeginning of the year, sent his final message to the Legislature on\r\nDecember 3, 1861. In that, referring to the action of the Maryland\r\nLegislature at its several sessions before that when the arrest of its\r\nmembers prevented an organization, he wrote, \"This continued until the\r\nGeneral Government had ample reason to believe it was about to go\r\nthrough the farce of enacting an ordinance of secession, when the\r\ntreason was summarily stopped by the dispersion of the traitors....\"\r\nAfter referring to the elections of the 13th of June and the 6th of\r\nNovember, he says, the people have \"declared, in the most emphatic\r\ntones, what I have never doubted, that Maryland has no sympathy with the\r\nrebellion, and desires to do her full share in the duty of suppressing\r\nit.\" It would be more easy than gracious to point out the inconsistency\r\nbetween his first statements and this last. The conclusion is inevitable\r\nthat he kept himself in equipoise, and fell at last, as men without\r\nconvictions usually do, upon the stronger side.\r\n\r\nHenceforth the story of Maryland is sad to the last degree, only\r\nrelieved by the gallant men who left their homes to fight the battle of\r\nState rights when Maryland no longer furnished them a field on which\r\nthey could maintain the rights their fathers left them. This was a fate\r\ndoubly sad to the sons of the heroic men who, under the designation of\r\nthe \"Maryland Line,\" did so much in our Revolutionary struggle to secure\r\nthe independence of the States; of the men who, at a later day, fought\r\nthe battle of North Point; of the people of a land which had furnished\r\nso many heroes and statesmen, and gave the great Chief-Justice Taney to\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\nThough Maryland did not become one of the Confederate States, she was\r\nendeared to the people thereof by many most enduring ties. Last in\r\norder, but first in cordiality, were the tender ministrations of her\r\nnoble daughters to the sick and wounded prisoners who were carried\r\nthrough the streets of Baltimore; and it is with shame we remember that\r\nbrutal guards on several occasions inflicted wounds upon gentlewomen who\r\napproached these suffering prisoners to offer them the relief of which\r\nthey so evidently stood in need.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of Northern forces at and near Washington City, made it\r\nevident that the great effort of the invasion would be from that point,\r\nwhile assaults of more or less vigor might be expected upon all\r\nimportant places which the enemy, by his facilities for transportation,\r\ncould reach. The concentration of Confederate troops in Virginia was\r\nbegun, and they were sent forward as rapidly as practicable to the\r\npoints threatened with attack.\r\n\r\nIt was soon manifest that, besides the army at Washington, which\r\nthreatened Virginia, there was a second one at Chambersburg,\r\nPennsylvania, under Major-General Patterson, designed to move through\r\nWilliamsport and Martinsburg, and another forming in Ohio, under the\r\ncommand of Major-General McClellan, destined to invade the western\r\ncounties of Virginia.\r\n\r\nThis latter force, having landed at Wheeling on May 26th, advanced as\r\nfar as Grafton on the 29th. At this time Colonel Porterfield, with the\r\nsmall force of seven hundred men, sent forward by Governor Letcher, of\r\nVirginia, was at Philippi. On the night of June 2d he was attacked by\r\nGeneral McClellan, with a strong force, and withdrew to Laurel Hill.\r\nReënforcements under General Garnett were sent forward and occupied the\r\nhill, while Colonel Pegram, the second in command, held Rich Mountain.\r\nOn July 11th the latter was attacked by two columns of the enemy, and,\r\nafter a vigorous defense, fell back on the 12th, losing many of his men,\r\nwho were made prisoners. General Garnett, hearing of this reverse,\r\nattempted to fall back, but was pursued by McClellan, and, while\r\nstriving to rally his rear guard, was killed. Five hundred of his men\r\nwere taken prisoners. This success left the Northern forces in\r\npossession of that region.\r\n\r\nThe difficult character of the country in which the battle was fought,\r\nas well from mountain acclivity as dense wood, rendered a minute\r\nknowledge of the roads of vast importance. There is reason to believe\r\nthat competent guides led the enemy, by roads unknown to our army, to\r\nthe flank and rear of its position, and thus caused the sacrifice of\r\nthose who had patriotically come to repel the invasion of the very\r\npeople who furnished the guides to the enemy. It was treachery\r\nconfounding the counsels of the brave. Thus occurred the disaster of\r\nRich Mountain and Laurel Hill.\r\n\r\nGeneral Robert Garnett was a native of Virginia, and a graduate of the\r\nUnited States Military Academy. He served in Mexico, on the staff of\r\nGeneral Z. Taylor, and was conspicuous for gallantry and good conduct,\r\nespecially in the battles of Monterey and Buena Vista. Recognizing his\r\nallegiance as due to the State of Virginia, from which he was appointed\r\na cadet, and thence won his various promotions in the army, he resigned\r\nhis commission when the State withdrew from the Union, and earnestly and\r\nusefully served as aide-de-camp to General R. E. Lee, the\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Army of Virginia, until she acceded to the\r\nConfederacy.\r\n\r\nWhen Western Virginia was invaded, he offered his services to go to her\r\ndefense, and, relying confidently on the sentiment, so strong in his own\r\nheart, of devotion to the State by all Virginians, he believed it was\r\nonly needful for him to have a nucleus around which the people could\r\nrally to resist the invasion of their country. How sadly he was\r\ndisappointed, and how bravely he struggled against adverse fortune, and\r\nhow gallantly he died in the discharge of his duty, are memories which,\r\nthough sad, bear with them to his friends the consolation that the\r\nmanner of his death was worthy of the way in which he lived, and that\r\neven his life was an offering he was not unwilling to make for the\r\nwelfare and honor of Virginia.\r\n\r\nHe fell while commanding the rear guard, to save his retreating army,\r\nthus exemplifying the highest quality of man, self-sacrifice for others,\r\nand such devotion and fortitude as made Ney the grandest figure in\r\nBonaparte's retreat from Moscow.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: \"Annual Cyclopædia,\" vol. i, p. 443.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: \"Baltimore American,\" June 28, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: New York \"World\", August 6, 1861.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n    Removal of the Seat of Government to Richmond.--Message to\r\n    Congress at Richmond.--Confederate Forces in Virginia.--Forces\r\n    of the Enemy.--Letter to General Johnston.--Combat at Bethel\r\n    Church.--Affair at Romney.--Movements of McDowell.--Battle of\r\n    Manassas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Provisional Congress, in session at Montgomery, Alabama, on the 21st\r\nof May, 1861, resolved \"that this Congress will adjourn on Tuesday next,\r\nto meet again on the 20th day of July at Richmond, Virginia.\" The\r\nresolution further authorized the President to have the several\r\nexecutive departments, with their archives, removed at such intermediate\r\ntime as he might determine, and added a proviso that, if any public\r\nemergency should \"render it impolitic to meet in Richmond,\" he should\r\ncall the Congress together at some other place to be selected by him.\r\n\r\nThe hostile demonstrations of the United States Government against\r\nVirginia caused the President, at an early day after the adjournment of\r\nCongress, to proceed to Richmond and to direct the executive\r\ndepartments, with their archives, to be removed to that place as soon as\r\ncould be conveniently done.\r\n\r\nIn the message delivered to the Congress at its meeting in Richmond,\r\naccording to adjournment, I gave the following explanation of my conduct\r\nunder the resolution above cited: \"Immediately after your adjournment,\r\nthe aggressive movement of the enemy required prompt, energetic action.\r\nThe accumulation of his forces on the Potomac sufficiently demonstrated\r\nthat his efforts were to be directed against Virginia, and from no point\r\ncould necessary measures for her defense and protection be so\r\neffectively decided as from her own capital.\"\r\n\r\nOn my arrival in Richmond, General R. E. Lee, as commander of the Army\r\nof Virginia, was found there, where he had established his headquarters.\r\nHe possessed my unqualified confidence, both as a soldier and a patriot,\r\nand the command he had exercised over the Army of Virginia, before her\r\naccession to the Confederacy, gave him that special knowledge which at\r\nthe time was most needful. As has been already briefly stated, troops\r\nhad previously been sent from other States of the Confederacy to the aid\r\nof Virginia. The forces there assembled were divided into three armies,\r\nat positions the most important and threatened: one, under General J. E.\r\nJohnston, at Harper's Ferry, covering the valley of the Shenandoah;\r\nanother, under General P. G. T. Beauregard, at Manassas, covering the\r\ndirect approach from Washington to Richmond; and the third, under\r\nGenerals Huger and Magruder, at Norfolk and on the Peninsula between the\r\nJames and York Rivers, covering the approach to Richmond from the\r\nseaboard.\r\n\r\nThe first and second of these armies, though separated by the Blue\r\nRidge, had such practicable communication with each other as to render\r\ntheir junction possible when the necessity should be foreseen. They both\r\nwere confronted by forces greatly superior in numbers to their own, and\r\nit was doubtful which would first be the object of attack. Harper's\r\nFerry was an important position, both for military and political\r\nconsiderations, and, though unfavorably situated for defense against an\r\nenemy which should seek to turn its position by crossing the Potomac\r\nabove, it was desirable to hold it as long as was consistent with\r\nsafety. The temporary occupation was especially needful for the removal\r\nof the valuable machinery and material in the armory located there, and\r\nwhich the enemy had failed to destroy, though he had for that purpose\r\nfired the buildings before his evacuation of the post. The\r\ndemonstrations of General Patterson, commanding the Federal army in that\r\nregion, caused General Johnston earnestly to insist on being allowed to\r\nretire to a position nearer to Winchester. Under these circumstances, an\r\nofficial letter was addressed to him, from which the following extract\r\nis made:\r\n\r\n    \"Adjutant and Inspector-General's Office,\r\n\r\n    \"Richmond, _June 13, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"_To_ General J. E. Johnston, _commanding Harper's Ferry,\r\n    Virginia_.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir: ... You had been heretofore instructed to exercise your\r\n    discretion as to retiring from your position at Harper's Ferry,\r\n    and taking the field to check the advance of the enemy.... The\r\n    ineffective portion of your command, together with the baggage\r\n    and whatever else would impede your operations in the field, it\r\n    would be well to send, without delay, to the Manassas road.\r\n    Should you not be sustained by the population of the Valley, so\r\n    as to enable you to turn upon the enemy before reaching\r\n    Winchester, you will continue slowly to retire to the Manassas\r\n    road, upon some of the passes of which it is hoped you will be\r\n    able to make an effective stand, even against a very superior\r\n    force. To this end, it might be well to send your engineer to\r\n    make a reconnaissance and construct such temporary works as may\r\n    be useful and proper.... For these reasons it has been with\r\n    reluctance that any attempt was made to give you specific\r\n    instructions, and you will accept assurances of the readiness\r\n    with which the freest exercise of discretion on your part will\r\n    be sustained.\r\n\r\n    \"Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"S. Cooper,\r\n\r\n    \"_Adjutant and Inspector-General_.\"\r\n\r\nThe earliest combat in this quarter, and which, in the inexperience of\r\nthe time, was regarded as a great battle, may claim a passing notice, as\r\nexemplifying the extent to which the individuality, self-reliance, and\r\nhabitual use of small-arms by the people of the South was a substitute\r\nfor military training, and, on the other hand, how the want of such\r\ntraining made the Northern new levies inferior to the like kind of\r\nSouthern troops.\r\n\r\nA detached work on the right of General Magruder's line was occupied\r\nJune 11, 1861, by the First Regiment of North Carolina Volunteers and\r\nthree hundred and sixty Virginians under the command of an educated,\r\nvigilant, and gallant soldier, then Colonel D. H. Hill, First Regiment\r\nNorth Carolina Volunteers, subsequently a lieutenant-general in the\r\nConfederate service. He reports that this small force was \"engaged for\r\nfive and a half hours with four and a half regiments of the enemy at\r\nBethel Church, nine miles from Hampton. The enemy made three distinct\r\nand well-sustained charges, but were repulsed with heavy loss. Our\r\ncavalry pursued them for six miles, when their retreat became a total\r\nrout.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other side, Frederick Townsend, colonel of Third Regiment of the\r\nenemy's forces, after stating with much minuteness the orders and line\r\nof march, describes how, \"about five or six miles from Hampton, a heavy\r\nand well-sustained fire of canister and small-arms was opened upon the\r\nregiment,\" and how it was afterward discovered to be a portion of their\r\nown column which had fired upon them. After due care for the wounded and\r\na recognition of their friends, the column proceeded, and the Colonel\r\ndescribes his regiment as moving to the attack \"in line of battle, as if\r\non parade, in the face of a severe fire of artillery and small-arms.\"\r\nSubsequently, the description proceeds, \"a company of my regiment had\r\nbeen separated from the regiment by a thickly-hedged ditch,\" and marched\r\nin the adjoining field in line with the main body. Not being aware of\r\nthe separation of that company, the Colonel states that, therefore,\r\n\"upon seeing among the breaks in the hedge the glistening of bayonets in\r\nthe adjoining field, I immediately concluded that the enemy were\r\noutflanking, and conceived it to be my duty to immediately retire and\r\nrepel that advance.\"[178]\r\n\r\nWithout knowing anything of the subsequent career of the Colonel from\r\nwhose report these extracts have been made, or of the officers who\r\nopened fire upon him while he was marching to the execution of the\r\norders under which they were all acting, it is fair to suppose that,\r\nafter a few months' experience, such scenes as are described could not\r\nhave occurred, and these citations have been made to show the value of\r\nmilitary training.\r\n\r\nIn further exemplification of the difference between the troops of the\r\nConfederate States and those of the United States, before either had\r\nbeen trained in war, I will cite an affair which occurred on the upper\r\nPotomac. Colonel A. P. Hill, commanding a brigade at Romney, in Western\r\nVirginia, having learned that the enemy had a command at the\r\ntwenty-first bridge on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, decided to\r\nattack it and to destroy the bridge, so as to interrupt the use of that\r\nimportant line of the enemy's communication. For this purpose he ordered\r\nColonel John C. Vaughn, of the Third Tennessee Volunteers, to proceed\r\nwith a detachment of two companies of his regiment and two companies of\r\nthe Thirteenth Virginia Volunteers to the position where the enemy were\r\nreported to be posted.\r\n\r\nColonel Vaughn reports that on June 18, 1861, at 8 P. M., he moved with\r\nhis command as ordered, marched eighteen miles, and, at 5 A. M. the next\r\nmorning, found the enemy on the north bank of the Potomac in some\r\nstrength of infantry and with two pieces of artillery. He had no\r\npicket-guards.\r\n\r\nAfter reconnaissance, the order to charge was given. It was necessary,\r\nin the execution of the order, to ford the river waist-deep, which\r\nColonel Vaughn reports \"was gallantly executed in good order but with\r\ngreat enthusiasm. As we appeared in sight at a distance of four hundred\r\nyards, the enemy broke and fled in all directions, firing as they ran\r\nonly a few random shots.... The enemy did not wait to fire their\r\nartillery, which we captured, both guns loaded; they were, however,\r\nspiked by the enemy before he fled. From the best information, their\r\nnumber was between two and three hundred.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Vaughn further states that, in pursuance of orders, he fired the\r\nbridge and then retired, bringing away the two guns and the enemy's\r\nflag, and other articles of little value which had been captured, and\r\narrived at brigade headquarters in the evening, with his command in high\r\nspirits good condition.\r\n\r\nColonel A. P. Hill, the energetic brigade commander who directed this\r\nexpedition, left the United States Army when the State, which had given\r\nhim to the military service of the General Government, passed her\r\nordinance of secession. The vigilance and enterprise he manifested on\r\nthis early occasion in the war of the States gave promise of the\r\nbrilliant career which gained for him the high rank of a\r\nlieutenant-general, and which there was nothing for his friends to\r\nregret save the honorable death which he met upon the field of battle.\r\n\r\nColonel Vaughn, the commander of the detachment, was new to war. His\r\npaths had been those of peace, and his home in the mountains of East\r\nTennessee might reasonably have secured him from any expectation that it\r\nwould ever be the theatre on which armies were to contend, and that he,\r\nin the mutation of human affairs, would become a soldier. He lived until\r\nthe close of the war, and, on larger fields than that on which he first\r\nappeared, proved that, though not educated for a soldier, he had\r\nendowments which compensated for that disadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe activity and vigilance of Stuart, afterward so distinguished as\r\ncommander of cavalry in the Army of Virginia, and the skill and daring\r\nof Jackson, soon by greater deeds to become immortal, checked, punished,\r\nand embarrassed the enemy in his threatened advances, and his movements\r\nbecame so devoid of a definite purpose that one was at a loss to divine\r\nthe object of his campaign, unless it was to detain General Johnston\r\nwith his forces in the Valley of the Shenandoah, while General McDowell,\r\nprofiting by the feint, should make the real attack upon General\r\nBeauregard's army at Manassas. However that may be, the evidence finally\r\nbecame conclusive that the enemy under General McDowell was moving to\r\nattack the army under General Beauregard. The contingency had therefore\r\narisen for that junction which was necessary to enable us to resist the\r\nvastly superior numbers of our assailant; for, though the most strenuous\r\nand not wholly unsuccessful exertions had been made to reënforce both\r\nthe Armies of the Shenandoah and of the Potomac, they yet remained far\r\nsmaller than those of the enemy confronting them, and made a junction of\r\nour forces indispensable whenever the real point of attack should be\r\nascertained. For this movement we had the advantage of an interior line,\r\nso that, if the enemy should discover it after it commenced, he could\r\nnot counteract it by adopting the same tactics. The success of this\r\npolicy, it will readily be perceived, depended upon the time of\r\nexecution, for, though from different causes, failure would equally\r\nresult if done too soon or too late. The determination as to which army\r\nshould be reënforced from the other, and the exact time of the transfer,\r\nmust have been a difficult problem, as both the generals appear to have\r\nbeen unable to solve it (each asking reënforcements from the other).\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of July General Johnston wrote an official letter, from which\r\nI make the following extracts:\r\n\r\n    \"Headquarters, Winchester, _July 9, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"General: ... Similar information from other sources gives me\r\n    the impression that the reënforcements arriving at Martinsburg\r\n    amount to seven or eight thousand. I have estimated the enemy's\r\n    force hitherto, you may remember, at eighteen thousand.\r\n    Additional artillery has also been received. They were greatly\r\n    superior to us in that arm before.\r\n\r\n    \"The object of reënforcing General Patterson must be an advance\r\n    upon this place. Fighting here against great odds seems to me\r\n    more prudent than retreat.\r\n\r\n    \"I have not asked for reënforcements, because I supposed that\r\n    the War Department, informed of the state of affairs everywhere,\r\n    could best judge where the troops at its disposal are most\r\n    required....\r\n\r\n    \"Most respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"Joseph E. Johnston,\r\n\r\n    \"_Brigadier-General, etc._\"\r\n\r\n    \"If it is proposed to strengthen us against the attack I suggest\r\n    as soon to be made, it seems to me that General Beauregard might\r\n    with _great expedition_ furnish five or six thousand men for a\r\n    few days.\r\n\r\n    \"J. E. J.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as I became satisfied that Manassas was the objective point of\r\nthe enemy's movement, I wrote to General Johnston, urging him to make\r\npreparations for a junction with General Beauregard, and to his\r\nobjections, and the difficulties he presented, replied at great length,\r\nendeavoring to convince him that the troops he described as embarrassing\r\na hasty march might be withdrawn in advance of the more effective\r\nportion of his command. Writing with entire confidence, I kept no copy\r\nof my letters, and, when subsequent events caused the wish to refer to\r\nthem, I requested General Johnston to send me copies of them. He replied\r\nthat his tent had been blown down, and his papers had been scattered.\r\nHis letters to me, which would show the general purport of mine to him,\r\nhave shared the fate which during or soon after the close of the war\r\nbefell most of the correspondence I had preserved, and his retained\r\ncopies, if still in his possession, do not appear to have been deemed of\r\nsufficient importance to be inserted in his published \"Narrative.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of July, 1861, the following telegram was sent by the\r\nAdjutant-General:\r\n\r\n    \"Richmond, _July 17, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"_To_ General J. E. Johnston, _Winchester, Virginia_.\r\n\r\n    \"General Beauregard is attacked. To strike the enemy a decisive\r\n    blow, a junction of all your effective force will be needed. If\r\n    practicable, make the movement, sending your sick and baggage to\r\n    Culpepper Court-House, either by railroad or by Warrenton. In\r\n    all the arrangements exercise your discretion.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"S. Cooper,\r\n\r\n    \"_Adjutant and Inspector-General_.\"\r\n\r\nThe confidence reposed in General Johnston, sufficiently evinced by the\r\nimportant command intrusted to him, was more than equal to the\r\nexpectation that he would do all that was practicable to execute the\r\norder for a junction, as well as to secure his sick and baggage. For the\r\nexecution of the one great purpose, that he would allow no minor\r\nquestion to interfere with that which was of vital importance, and for\r\nwhich he was informed all his \"effective force\" would \"be needed.\"\r\n\r\nThe order referred to was the telegram inserted above, in which the\r\nsending the sick to Culpepper Court-House might have been after or\r\nbefore the effective force had moved to the execution of the main and\r\nonly positive part of the order. All the arrangements were left to the\r\ndiscretion of the General. It seems strange that any one has construed\r\nthis expression as meaning that the movement for a junction was left to\r\nthe discretion of that officer, and that the forming of a junction--the\r\nimperious necessity--should have been termed in the order \"all the\r\narrangement,\" instead of referring that word to its proper connection,\r\nthe route and mode of transportation. The General had no margin on which\r\nto institute a comparison as to the importance of his remaining in the\r\nValley, according to his previous assignment, or going where he was\r\nordered by competent authority.\r\n\r\nIt gives me pleasure to state that, from all the accounts received at\r\nthe time, the plans of General Johnston, for masking his withdrawal to\r\nform a junction with General Beauregard, were conducted with marked\r\nskill, and, though all of his troops did not arrive as soon as expected\r\nand needed, he has satisfactorily shown that the failure was not due to\r\nany defect in his arrangements for their transportation.\r\n\r\nThe great question of uniting the two armies had been decided at\r\nRichmond. The time and place depended on the enemy, and, when it was\r\nseen that the real attack was to be against the position at Manassas,\r\nthe order was sent to General Johnston to move to that point. His\r\nletters of the 12th and 15th instant expressed his doubts about his\r\npower to retire from before the superior force of General Patterson,\r\ntherefore the word \"practicable\" was in this connection the equivalent\r\nof possible. That it was, at the time, so understood by General\r\nJohnston, is shown by his reply to the telegram.\r\n\r\n    \"Headquarters, Winchester, _July 18, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"General: I have had the honor to receive your telegram of\r\n    yesterday.\r\n\r\n    \"General Patterson, who had been at Bunker Hill since Monday,\r\n    seems to have moved yesterday to Charlestown, twenty-three miles\r\n    to the east of Winchester.\r\n\r\n    \"Unless he prevents it, we shall move toward General Beauregard\r\n    to-day....\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"Joseph E. Johnston.\r\n\r\n    \"General S. Cooper.\"\r\n\r\nAfter General Johnston commenced his march to Manassas, he sent to me a\r\ntelegram, the substance of which, as my memory serves and the reply\r\nindicates, was an inquiry as to the relative position he would occupy\r\ntoward General Beauregard. I returned the following answer:\r\n\r\n    \"Richmond, _July 20, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"General J. E. Johnston, _Manassas Junction, Virginia_.\r\n\r\n    \"You are a general in the Confederate Army, possessed of the\r\n    power attaching to that rank. You will know how to make the\r\n    exact knowledge of Brigadier-General Beauregard, as well of the\r\n    ground as of the troops and preparation, avail for the success\r\n    of the object in which you coöperate. The zeal of both assures\r\n    me of harmonious action.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Johnston, by his promotion to the grade of general, as well as\r\nhis superior rank as a brigadier over Brigadier-General Beauregard, gave\r\nhim precedence; so there was no need to ask which of the two would\r\ncommand the whole, when their troops should join and do duty together.\r\nTherefore his inquiry, as it was revolved in my mind, created an\r\nanxiety, not felt before, lest there should be some unfortunate\r\ncomplication, or misunderstanding, between these officers, when their\r\nforces should be united. Regarding the combat of the 18th of July as the\r\nprecursor of a battle, I decided, at the earliest moment, to go in\r\nperson to the army.\r\n\r\nAs has been heretofore stated, Congress was to assemble on the 20th of\r\nJuly, to hold its first session at the new capital, Richmond, Virginia.\r\nMy presence on that occasion and the delivery of a message were required\r\nby usage and law. After the delivery of the message to Congress on\r\nSaturday, the 20th of July, I intended to leave in the afternoon for\r\nManassas, but was detained until the next morning, when I left by rail,\r\naccompanied by my aide-de-camp, Colonel J. R. Davis, to confer with the\r\ngenerals on the field. As we approached Manassas Railroad junction, a\r\ncloud of dust was visible a short distance to the west of the railroad.\r\nIt resembled one raised by a body of marching troops, and recalled to my\r\nremembrance the design of General Beauregard to make the Rappahannock\r\nhis second line of defense. It was, however, subsequently learned that\r\nthe dust was raised by a number of wagons which had been sent to the\r\nrear for greater security against the contingencies of the battle. The\r\nsound of the firing had now become very distinct, so much so as to leave\r\nno doubt that a general engagement had commenced. Though that event had\r\nbeen anticipated as being near at hand after the action of the 18th, it\r\nwas both hoped and desired that it would not occur quite so soon, the\r\nmore so as it was not known whether the troops from the Valley had yet\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the railroad junction, I found a large number of men,\r\nbearing the usual evidence of those who leave the field of battle under\r\na panic. They crowded around the train with fearful stories of a defeat\r\nof our army. The railroad conductor announced his decision that the\r\nrailroad train should proceed no farther. Looking among those who were\r\nabout us for one whose demeanor gave reason to expect from him a\r\ncollected answer, I selected one whose gray beard and calm face gave\r\nbest assurance. He, however, could furnish no encouragement. Our line,\r\nhe said, was broken, all was confusion, the army routed, and the battle\r\nlost. I asked for Generals Johnston and Beauregard; he said they were on\r\nthe field when he left it. I returned to the conductor and told him that\r\nI must go on; that the railroad was the only means by which I could\r\nproceed, and that, until I reached the headquarters, I could not get a\r\nhorse to ride to the field where the battle was ragging. He finally\r\nconsented to detach the locomotive from the train, and, for my\r\naccommodation, to run it as far as the army headquarters. In this manner\r\nColonel Davis, aide-de-camp, and myself proceeded.\r\n\r\nAt the headquarters we found the Quartermaster General, W. L. Cabell,\r\nand the Adjutant-General, Jordan, of General Beauregard's staff, who\r\ncourteously agreed to furnish us horses, and also to show us the route.\r\nWhile the horses were being prepared, Colonel Jordan took occasion to\r\nadvise my aide-de-camp, Colonel Davis, of the hazard of going to the\r\nfield, and the impropriety of such exposure on my part. The horses were\r\nafter a time reported ready, and we started to the field. The stragglers\r\nsoon became numerous, and warnings as to the fate which awaited us if we\r\nadvanced were not only frequent but evidently sincere.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, many who turned back, and the wounded generally\r\ncheered upon meeting us. I well remember one, a mere stripling, who,\r\nsupported on the shoulders of a man, who was bearing him to the rear,\r\ntook off his cap and waved it with a cheer, that showed within that\r\nslender form beat the heart of a hero--breathed a spirit that would dare\r\nthe labors of Hercules.\r\n\r\nAs we advanced, the storm of the battle was rolling westward, and its\r\nfury became more faint. When I met General Johnston, who was upon a hill\r\nwhich commanded a general view of the field of the afternoon's\r\noperations, and inquired of him as to the state of affairs, he replied\r\nthat we had won the battle. I left him there and rode still farther to\r\nthe west. Several of the volunteers on General Beauregard's staff joined\r\nme, and a command of cavalry, the gallant leader of which, Captain John\r\nF. Lay, insisted that I was too near the enemy to be without an escort.\r\nWe, however, only saw one column near to us that created a doubt as to\r\nwhich side it belonged; and, as we were riding toward it, it was\r\nsuggested that we should halt until it could be examined with a\r\nfield-glass. Colonel Chesnut dismounted so as the better to use his\r\nglass, and at that moment the column formed into line, by which the wind\r\nstruck the flag so as to extend it, and it was plainly revealed to be\r\nthat of the United States.\r\n\r\nOur cavalry, though there was present but the squadron previously\r\nmentioned, and from a statement of the commander of which I will make\r\nsome extracts, dashed boldly forward to charge. The demonstration was\r\nfollowed by the immediate retreat of what was, I believe, the last,\r\nthereabout, of the enemy's forces maintaining their organization, and\r\nshowing a disposition to dispute the possession of the field of battle.\r\nIn riding over the ground, it seemed quite possible to mark the line of\r\na fugitive's flight. Here was a musket, there a cartridge-box, there a\r\nblanket or overcoat, a haversack, etc., as if the runner had stripped\r\nhimself, as he went, of all impediments to speed.\r\n\r\nAs we approached toward the left of our line, the signs of an utter rout\r\nof the enemy were unmistakable, and justified the conclusion that the\r\nwatchword of \"On to Richmond!\" had been changed to \"Off for Washington!\"\r\n\r\nOn the extreme left of our field of operations, I found the troops whose\r\nopportune arrival had averted impending disaster, and had so materially\r\ncontributed to our victory. Some of them had, after arriving at the\r\nManassas Railroad junction, hastened to our left; their\r\nbrigadier-general, E. K. Smith, was wounded soon after getting into\r\naction, and the command of the brigade devolved upon Elzy, by whom it\r\nwas gallantly and skillfully led to the close of the battle; others,\r\nunder the command of General (then Colonel) Early, made a rapid march,\r\nunder the pressing necessity, from the extreme right of our line to and\r\nbeyond our left, so as to attack the enemy in flank, thus inflicting on\r\nhim the discomfiture his oblique movement was designed to inflict on us.\r\nAll these troops and the others near to them had hastened into action\r\nwithout supplies or camp-equipage; weary, hungry, and without shelter,\r\nnight closed around them where they stood, the blood-stained victors on\r\na hard-fought field.\r\n\r\nIt was reported to me that some of the troops had been so long without\r\nfood as to be suffering severe hunger, and that no supplies could be got\r\nwhere they were. I made several addresses to them, all to the effect\r\nthat their position was that best adapted to a pursuit of the enemy, and\r\nthat they should therefore remain there; adding that I would go to the\r\nheadquarters and direct that supplies should be sent to them promptly.\r\n\r\nGeneral (then Colonel) Early, commanding a brigade, informed me of some\r\nwounded who required attention; one, Colonel Gardner, was, he said, at a\r\nhouse not far from where we were. I rode to see him, found him in severe\r\npain, and from the twitching, visible and frequent, seemed to be\r\nthreatened with tetanus. A man sat beside him whose uniform was that of\r\nthe enemy; but he was gentle, and appeared to be solicitously attentive.\r\nHe said that he had no morphine, and did not know where to get any. I\r\nfound in a short time a surgeon who went with me to Colonel Gardner,\r\nhaving the articles necessary in the case. Before leaving Colonel\r\nGardner, he told me that the man who was attending to him might, without\r\nhindrance, have retreated with his comrades, but had kindly remained\r\nwith him, and he therefore asked my protection for the man. I took the\r\nname and the State of the supposed good Samaritan, and at army\r\nheadquarters directed that he should not be treated as a prisoner. The\r\nsequel will be told hereafter.\r\n\r\nIt was then late, and we rode back in the night, say seven miles, to the\r\narmy headquarters. I had not seen General Beauregard on the field, and\r\ndid not find him at his quarters when we returned; the promise made to\r\nthe troops was therefore communicated to a staff-officer, who said he\r\nwould have the supplies sent out. At a later hour when I met General\r\nBeauregard and informed him of what had occurred, he stated that,\r\nbecause of a false alarm which had reached him, he had ordered the\r\ntroops referred to from the left to the right of our line, so as to be\r\nin position to repel the reported movement of the enemy against that\r\nflank. That such an alarm should have been credited, and a night march\r\nordered on account of it, shows how little the completeness of the\r\nvictory was realized.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: see \"Rebellion Record,\" vol. ii, pp. 164, 165.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n    Conference with the Generals after the Battle.--Order to pursue\r\n    the Enemy.--Evidences of a Thorough Rout.--\"Sweet to die for\r\n    such a Cause.\"--Movements of the Next Day.--What more it was\r\n    practicable to do.--Charge against the President of preventing\r\n    the Capture of Washington.--The Failure to pursue.--Reflection\r\n    on the President.--General Beauregard's Report.--Endorsement\r\n    upon it.--Strength of the Opposing Forces.--Extracts relating to\r\n    the Battle, from the Narrative of General Early.--Resolutions of\r\n    Congress.--Efforts to increase the Efficiency of the Army.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a late hour of the night, I had a conference with Generals Johnston\r\nand Beauregard; the Adjutant-General of the latter, Colonel Jordan, was\r\npresent, and sat opposite to me at the table.\r\n\r\nWhen, after some preliminary conversation, I asked whether any troops\r\nhad been sent in pursuit of the enemy, I was answered in the negative.\r\nUpon further inquiry as to what troops were in the best position for\r\npursuit, and had been least fatigued during the day, General Bonham's\r\nbrigade was named. I then suggested that he should be ordered in\r\npursuit; a pause ensued, until Colonel Jordan asked me if I would\r\ndictate the order. I at once dictated an order for immediate pursuit.\r\nSome conversation followed, the result of which was a modification of\r\nthe order by myself, so that, instead of immediate pursuit, it should be\r\ncommenced at early dawn. Colonel Jordan spoke across the table to me,\r\nsaying, \"If you will send the order as you first dictated it, the enemy\r\nwon't stop till he gets into the Potomac.\" I believe I remember the\r\nwords very nearly, and am quite sure that I do remember them\r\nsubstantially. On the 25th of March, 1878, I wrote to General Beauregard\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Sir: Permit me to ask you to recall the conference held\r\n    between General Johnston, yourself, and myself, on the night\r\n    after the close of the battle of Manassas; and to give me, if\r\n    you can, a copy of the order which I dictated, and which your\r\n    adjutant-general, T. J. Jordan, wrote at my dictation, directing\r\n    Brigadier-General Bonham to follow the retreating enemy. If you\r\n    can not furnish a copy of the order, please give me your\r\n    recollection of its substance.\r\n\r\n    \"Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n    (Signed)  \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\nTo this letter General Beauregard courteously replied that his\r\norder-book was in New York, in the hands of a friend, to whom he would\r\nwrite for a copy of the order desired if it should be in said book, and\r\nthat he would also write to his adjutant, General Jordan, for his\r\nrecollection of the order if it had not been inscribed in the\r\norder-book.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of April General Beauregard forwarded to me the answer to\r\nhis inquiries in my behalf, as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"New York, 63 Broadway, _April 18, 1878_.\r\n\r\n    \"My dear General: In answer to your note, I hasten to say that\r\n    properly Mr. Davis is not to be held accountable for our failure\r\n    to pursue McDowell from the field of Manassas the night of the\r\n    21st of July, 1861.\r\n\r\n    \"As to the order, to which I presume Mr. Davis refers in his\r\n    note to you, I recollect the incident very distinctly.\r\n\r\n    \"The night of the battle, as I was about to ascend to your\r\n    quarters over my office, Captain E. P. Alexander, of your staff,\r\n    informed me that Captain ----, attached to General Johnston's\r\n    Army of the Shenandoah, reported that he had been as far forward\r\n    as Centreville, where he had seen the Federal army completely\r\n    routed and in full flight toward Washington.\r\n\r\n    \"This statement I at once repeated to Mr. Davis, General\r\n    Johnston, and yourself, whom I found seated around your\r\n    table--Mr. Davis at the moment writing a dispatch to General\r\n    Cooper.\r\n\r\n    \"As soon as I had made my report, Mr. Davis with much animation\r\n    asserted the necessity for an urgent pursuit that night by\r\n    Bonham, who, with his own brigade and that of Longstreet, was in\r\n    close proximity to Centreville at the moment. So I took my seat\r\n    at the same table with you, and wrote the order for pursuit,\r\n    substantially at the dictation of Mr. Davis. But, while writing,\r\n    either I happened to remember, or Captain Alexander himself--as\r\n    I am inclined to believe--called me aside to remind me that his\r\n    informant was known among us of the old army as ---- ----,\r\n    because of eccentricities, and in contradistinction with others\r\n    of the same name. When I repeated this reminder, Mr. Davis\r\n    recalled the _sobriquet_, as he had a precise personal knowledge\r\n    of the officers of the old army. He laughed heartily, as did all\r\n    present.\r\n\r\n    \"The question of throwing General Bonham forward that night,\r\n    upon the unverified report of Captain ----, was now briefly\r\n    discussed, with a unanimous decision against it; therefore, the\r\n    order was not dispatched.\r\n\r\n    \"It is proper to add in this connection that, so far as I am\r\n    aware--and I had the opportunity of knowing what occurred--this\r\n    was the only instance during Mr. Davis's stay at Manassas in\r\n    which he exercised any voice as to the movement of the troops.\r\n    Profoundly pleased with the results achieved by the happy\r\n    juncture of the two Confederate armies upon the very field of\r\n    battle, his bearing toward the generals who commanded them was\r\n    eminently proper, as I have testified on a former occasion; and,\r\n    I repeat, he certainly expressed or manifested no opposition to\r\n    a forward movement, nor did he display the least disposition to\r\n    interfere by opinion or authority touching what the Confederate\r\n    forces should or should not do.\r\n\r\n    \"You having at the close of the day surrendered the command,\r\n    which had been left in your hands, over both Confederate armies\r\n    during the engagement, General Johnston was that night in chief\r\n    command. He was decidedly averse to an immediate offensive, and\r\n    emphatically discountenanced it as impracticable.\r\n\r\n    \"Very truly, your friend,\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"Thomas Jordan.\r\n\r\n    \"General P. G. T. Beauregard, _New Orleans, Louisiana_.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Beauregard, in his letter forwarding the above, wrote, \"The\r\naccount given herewith by General Jordan of what occurred there\r\nrespecting further pursuit that night agrees with my own recollection.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of importance, as I regarded it, to follow closely on\r\nthe retreating enemy, but it was of no consequence then or now as to who\r\nissued the order for pursuit, and, unless requested, I should not have\r\ndictated one, preferring that the generals to whom the operations were\r\nconfided should issue all orders to the troops. I supposed the order, as\r\nmodified by myself, had been sent. I have found, however, since the\r\nclose of the war, that it was not, but that an order to the same effect\r\nwas sent on the night of the 21st of July, for a copy of which I am\r\nindebted to the kindness of that chivalrous gentleman, soldier, and\r\npatriot, General Bonham. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Headquarters Army of the Potomac,\r\n\r\n    \"Manassas, _July 21, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"(Special Orders, No. 140.)\r\n\r\n    \"I. General Bonham will send, as early as practicable in the\r\n    morning, a command of two of his regiments of infantry, a strong\r\n    force of cavalry, and one field-battery, to scour the country\r\n    and roads to his front, toward Centreville. He will carry with\r\n    him abundant means of transportation for the collection of our\r\n    wounded, all the arms, ammunition, and abandoned hospital\r\n    stores, subsistence, and baggage, which will be sent immediately\r\n    to these headquarters.\r\n\r\n    \"General Bonham will advance with caution, throwing out an\r\n    advanced guard and skirmishers on his right and left, and the\r\n    utmost caution must be taken to prevent firing into our own men.\r\n\r\n    \"Should it appear, while this command is occupied as directed,\r\n    that it is insufficient for the purposes indicated, General\r\n    Bonham will call on the nearest brigade commander for support.\r\n\r\n    \"II. Colonel P. St. George Cocke, commanding, will dispatch at\r\n    the same time, for similar purposes, a command of the same size\r\n    and proportions of infantry, artillery, and cavalry on the road\r\n    _via_ Stone Bridge; and another command of two companies of\r\n    infantry and one of cavalry on the road by which the enemy\r\n    retreated toward and _via_ Sudley's Mills.\r\n\r\n    \"By command of Brigadier-General Beauregard:\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"Thomas Jordan, _A. A. Adjutant-General._\r\n\r\n    \"To Brigadier-General Bonham.\"\r\n\r\nImpressed with the belief that the enemy was very superior to us, both\r\nin numbers and appointments, I had felt apprehensive that, unless\r\npressed, he would recover from the panic under which he fled from the\r\nfield, rally on his reserves, and renew the contest. Therefore it was\r\nthat I immediately felt the necessity for a pursuit of the fugitives,\r\nand insisted that the troops on the extreme left should retain their\r\nposition during the night of the 21st, as has been heretofore stated. In\r\nconference with the generals that night, this subject was considered,\r\nand I dictated an order for a movement on the rear of the enemy at early\r\ndawn, which, on account of the late hour at which it was given, differed\r\nvery little from one for an immediate movement. A rainfall,\r\nextraordinary for its violence and duration, occurred on the morning of\r\nthe succeeding day, so that, over places where during the battle one\r\ncould scarcely get a drink of water, rolled torrents which, in the\r\nafternoon of the 22d, it was difficult to cross.\r\n\r\nFrom these and other causes, the troops were scattered to such an extent\r\nthat but few commands could have been assembled for immediate service.\r\nIt was well for us that the enemy, instead of retiring in order, so as\r\nto be rallied and again brought to the attack, left hope behind, and\r\nfled in dismay to seek for safety beyond the Potomac.\r\n\r\nEach hour of the day following the battle added to the evidence of a\r\nthorough rout of the enemy. Abandoned wagons, stores, guns, caissons,\r\nsmall-arms, and ammunition, proved his complete demoralization. As far\r\nas our cavalry went, no hostile force was met, and all the indications\r\nfavored the conclusion that the purpose of invasion had for the time\r\nbeen abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe victory, though decisive and important, both in its moral and\r\nphysical effect, had been dearly bought by the sacrifice of the lives of\r\nmany of our bravest and best, who at the first call of their country had\r\nrushed to its defense.\r\n\r\nWhen riding to the front, I met an ambulance bearing General Barnard Bee\r\nfrom the field, where he had been mortally wounded, after his patriotism\r\nhad been illustrated by conspicuous exhibitions of skill, daring, and\r\nfortitude. Soon after, I learned that my friend Colonel Bartow had\r\nheroically sealed with his life-blood his faith in the sanctity of our\r\ncause. He had been the chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs in\r\nthe Provisional Congress, and, after the laws were enacted to provide\r\nfor the public defense, he went to the field to maintain them. It is to\r\nsuch virtuous and devoted citizens that a country is indebted for its\r\nprosperity and honor, as well in peace as in war.\r\n\r\nReference has been made to the dispersion of our troops after the\r\nbattle, and in this connection the following facts are mentioned: In the\r\nafternoon of the 22d, with a guide, supposed to be cognizant of the\r\npositions at which the different commands would be found, I went to\r\nvisit the wounded, and among them a youth of my family, who, it was\r\nreported to me, was rapidly sinking. After driving many miles, and\r\nwitnessing very painful scenes, but seldom finding the troops in the\r\nposition where my guide supposed them to be, and always disappointed in\r\nnot discovering him I particularly sought, I was, at the approach of\r\nnight, about to abandon the search, when, accidentally meeting an\r\nofficer of the command to which the youth belonged, I was directed to\r\nthe temporary hospital to which the wounded of that command had been\r\nremoved. It was too late; the soul of the young soldier had just left\r\nhis body; the corpse lay before me. Around him were many gentle boys,\r\nsuffering in different degrees from the wounds they had received. One\r\nbright, refined-looking youth from South Carolina, severely if not\r\nfatally wounded, responded to my expression of sympathy by the heroic\r\ndeclaration that it was \"sweet to die for such a cause.\"\r\n\r\nMany kindred spirits ascended to the Father from that field of their\r\nglory. The roll need not be recorded here; it has a more enduring\r\ndepository than the pen can make--the traditions of a grateful people.\r\n\r\nThe victory at Manassas was certainly extraordinary, not only on account\r\nof the disparity of numbers and the inferiority of our arms, but also\r\nbecause of many other disadvantages under which we labored. We had no\r\ndisciplined troops, and, though our citizens were generally skilled in\r\nthe use of small-arms, which, with their high pride and courage, might\r\ncompensate for the want of training while in position, these\r\ninadequately substituted military instruction when manoeuvres had to be\r\nperformed under fire, and could not make the old-fashioned musket equal\r\nto the long-range, new-model muskets with which the enemy was supplied.\r\nThe disparity in artillery was still greater, both in the number and\r\nkind of guns; but, thanks to the skill and cool courage of the Rev.\r\nCaptain W. N. Pendleton, his battery of light, smooth-bore guns, manned\r\nprincipally by the youths whose rector he had been, proved more\r\neffective in battle than the long-range rifle-guns of the enemy. The\r\ncharacter of the ground brought the forces into close contact, and the\r\nricochet of the round balls carried havoc into the columns of the enemy,\r\nwhile the bolts of their rifle-guns, if they missed their object,\r\npenetrated harmlessly into the ground.\r\n\r\nThe field was very extensive, broken, and wooded. The senior general had\r\nso recently arrived that he had no opportunity minutely to learn the\r\nground, and the troops he brought were both unacquainted with the field\r\nand with those with whom they had to coöperate. To all this must be\r\nadded the disturbing fact that the plan of battle, as originally\r\ndesigned, was entirely changed by the movement of the enemy on our\r\nextreme left, instead of right and center, as anticipated. The\r\noperations, therefore, had to be conducted against the plan of the\r\nenemy, instead of on that which our generals had prepared and explained\r\nto their subordinate commanders. The promptitude with which the troops\r\nmoved, and the readiness with which our generals modified their\r\npreconceived plans to meet the necessities as they were developed,\r\nentitled them to the commendation so liberally bestowed at the time by\r\ntheir countrymen at large.\r\n\r\nGeneral Johnston had been previously promoted to the highest grade in\r\nour army, and I deemed it but a fitting reward for the services rendered\r\nby General Beauregard that he should be promoted to the same grade;\r\ntherefore, I addressed to him the following letter:\r\n\r\n    \"Manassas, Virginia, _July 21, 1861._\r\n\r\n    \"Sir: Appreciating your services in the battle of Manassas, and\r\n    on several other occasions during the existing war, as affording\r\n    the highest evidence of your skill as a commander, your\r\n    gallantry as a soldier, and your zeal as a patriot, you are\r\n    promoted to be a general in the army of the Confederate States\r\n    of America, and, with the consent of the Congress, will be duly\r\n    commissioned accordingly.\r\n\r\n    \"Yours, etc.,\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"Jefferson Davis.\r\n\r\n    \"General P. G. T. Beauregard, etc.\"\r\n\r\nThe 22d, the day after the battle, was spent in following up the line of\r\nthe retreating foe, and collecting the large supplies of arms, of\r\nammunition, and other military stores. The supplies of the army were on\r\na scale of such luxurious extravagance as to excite the surprise of\r\nthose accustomed only to our rigid economy. The anticipation of an easy\r\nvictory had caused many to come to the battle as to a joyous feast, and\r\nthe signs left behind them of the extent to which they had been\r\ndisappointed in the entertainment, constituted the staple of many\r\nlaughable stories, which were not without their value because of the\r\nlesson they contained as to the uncertainties of war, and the\r\nmortification that usually follows vain boasting. Among the articles\r\nabandoned by the enemy in his flight were some which excited a just\r\nindignation, and which indicated the shameless disregard of all the\r\nusages of honorable warfare. They were handcuffs, the fit appendage of a\r\npoliceman, but not of a soldier who came to meet his foeman hilt to\r\nhilt. These were reported to have been found in large numbers; some of\r\nthem were sent to Richmond.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 22d I held a second conference with Generals\r\nJohnston and Beauregard. All the revelations of the day were of the most\r\nsatisfactory character as to the completeness of our victory. The large\r\namount gained of fine artillery, small-arms, and ammunition, all of\r\nwhich were much needed by us, was not the least gratifying consequence\r\nof our success. The generals, like myself, were well content with what\r\nhad been done.\r\n\r\nI propounded to them the inquiry as to what more it was practicable to\r\ndo. They concurred as to their inability to cross the Potomac, and to\r\nthe further inquiry as to an advance to the south side of the Potomac,\r\nGeneral Beauregard promptly stated that there were strong fortifications\r\nthere, occupied by garrisons, which had not been in the battle, and were\r\ntherefore not affected by the panic which had seized the defeated army.\r\nHe described those fortifications as having wide, deep ditches, with\r\npalisades, which would prevent the escalade of the works. Turning to\r\nGeneral Johnston, he said, \"They have spared no expense.\" It was further\r\nstated in explanation that we had no sappers and miners, nor even the\r\ntools requisite to make regular approaches. If we had possessed both,\r\nthe time required for such operations would have more than sufficed for\r\nGeneral Patterson's army and other forces to have been brought to that\r\nlocality in such numbers as must have rendered the attempt, with our\r\npresent means, futile.\r\n\r\nThis view of the matter rests on the supposition that the fortifications\r\nand garrisons described did actually exist, of which there seemed then\r\nto be no doubt. If the reports which have since reached us be true, that\r\nthere were at that time neither fortifications nor troops stationed on\r\nthe south bank of the Potomac; that all the enemy's forces fled to the\r\nnorth side of the river, and even beyond; that the panic of the routed\r\narmy infected the whole population of Washington City; and that no\r\npreparation was made, or even contemplated, for the destruction of the\r\nbridge across the Potomac--then it may have been, as many have asserted,\r\nthat our army, following close upon the flying enemy, could have entered\r\nand taken possession of the United States capital. These reports,\r\nhowever, present a condition of affairs altogether at variance with the\r\ninformation on which we had to act. Thus it was, and, so far as I knew,\r\nfor the reasons above stated, that an advance to the south bank of the\r\nPotomac was not contemplated as the immediate sequence of the victory at\r\nManassas. What discoveries would have been made and what results would\r\nhave ensued from the establishment of our guns upon the south bank of\r\nthe river, to open fire upon the capital, are speculative questions upon\r\nwhich it would be useless to enter.\r\n\r\nAfter the conference of the 22d, and because of it, I decided to return\r\nto Richmond and employ all the power of my office to increase the\r\nstrength of the army, so as the better to enable it to meet the public\r\nneed, whether in offensive-defensive or purely defensive operations, as\r\nopportunity should offer for the one, or the renewal of invasion require\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nA short time subsequent to my return, a message was brought to me from\r\nthe prison, to the effect that a non-commissioned officer, captured at\r\nManassas, claimed to have a promise of protection from me. The name was\r\ngiven Hulburt, of Connecticut. I had forgotten the name he gave when I\r\nsaw him; but, believing that I would recognize the person who had\r\nattended to Colonel Gardner, and to whom only such a promise had been\r\ngiven, the officer in charge was directed to send him to me. When he\r\ncame, I had no doubt of his identity, and explained to him that I had\r\ndirected that he should not be treated as a prisoner, but that, in the\r\nmultitude of those wearing the same uniform as his, some neglect or\r\nmistake had arisen, for which I was very sorry, and that he should be\r\nimmediately released and sent down the river to the neighborhood of\r\nFortress Monroe, where he would be among his own people. He then told me\r\nthat he had a sister residing a few miles in the country, whom he would\r\nbe very glad to visit. Permission was given him to do so, and a time\r\nfixed at which he was to report for transportation; and so he left, with\r\nmanifestations of thankfulness for the kindness with which he had been\r\ntreated. In due time a newspaper was received, containing an account of\r\nhis escape, and how he had lingered about the suburbs of Richmond and\r\nmade drawings of the surrounding fortifications. The treachery was as\r\ngreat as if his drawings had been valuable, which they could not have\r\nbeen, as we had only then commenced the detached works which were\r\ndesigned as a system of defenses for Richmond.\r\n\r\nWhen the smoke of battle had lifted from the field of Manassas, and the\r\nrejoicing over the victory had spread over the land and spent its\r\nexuberance, some, who, like Job's war-horse, \"snuffed the battle from\r\nafar,\" but in whom the likeness there ceased, censoriously asked why the\r\nfruits of the victory had not been gathered by the capture of Washington\r\nCity. Then some indiscreet friends of the generals commanding in that\r\nbattle, instead of the easier task of justification, chose the harder\r\none of exculpation for the imputed failure. Their ill-advised zeal,\r\ncombined perhaps with malice against me, induced the allegation that the\r\nPresident had prevented the generals from making an immediate and\r\nvigorous pursuit of the routed enemy.\r\n\r\nThis, as other stories had been, was left to the correction which time\r\nit was hoped would bring, the sooner because it was expected to be\r\nrefuted by the reports of the commanding generals with whom I had\r\nconferred on that subject immediately after the battle.\r\n\r\nAfter considerable time had elapsed, it was reported to me that a member\r\nof Congress, who had served on that occasion as a volunteer aide to\r\nGeneral Beauregard, had stated in the House of Representatives that I\r\nhad prevented the pursuit of the enemy after his defeat at Manassas.\r\n\r\nThis gave to the rumor such official character and dignity as seemed to\r\nme to entitle it to notice not theretofore given, wherefore I addressed\r\nto General Johnston the following inquiry, which, though restricted in\r\nits terms to the allegation, was of such tenor as left it to his option\r\nto state all the facts connected with the slander, if he should choose\r\nto do me that justice, or should see the public interest involved in the\r\ncorrection, which, as stated in my letter to him, was that which gave it\r\nin my estimation its claim to consideration, and had caused me to\r\naddress him on the subject:\r\n\r\n    \"Richmond, Virginia, _November 3, 1861._\r\n\r\n    \"General J. E. Johnston, _commanding Department of the Potomac._\r\n\r\n    \"Sir: Reports have been, and are being, widely circulated to the\r\n    effect that I prevented General Beauregard from pursuing the\r\n    enemy after the battle of Manassas, and had subsequently\r\n    restrained him from advancing upon Washington City. Though such\r\n    statements may have been made merely for my injury, and in that\r\n    view might be postponed to a more convenient season, they have\r\n    acquired importance from the fact that they have served to\r\n    create distrust, to excite disappointment, and must embarrass\r\n    the Administration in its further efforts to reënforce the\r\n    armies of the Potomac, and generally to provide for the public\r\n    defense. For these public considerations, I call upon you, as\r\n    the commanding general, and as a party to all the conferences\r\n    held by me on the 21st and 22d of July, to say whether I\r\n    obstructed the pursuit of the enemy after the victory at\r\n    Manassas, or have ever objected to an advance or other active\r\n    operation which it was feasible for the army to undertake.\r\n\r\n    \"Very respectfully, yours, etc.,\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Headquarters, Centreville, _November 10, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"To his Excellency the President.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir: I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 3d\r\n    inst., in which you call upon me, 'as the commanding general,\r\n    and as a party to all the conferences held by you on the 21st\r\n    and 22d of July, to say whether you obstructed the pursuit after\r\n    the victory of Manassas, or have ever objected to an advance or\r\n    other active operation which it was feasible for the army to\r\n    undertake?'\r\n\r\n    \"To the first question I reply, No. The pursuit was 'obstructed'\r\n    by the enemy's troops at Centreville, as I have stated in my\r\n    official report. In that report I have also said why no advance\r\n    was made upon the enemy's capital (for reasons) as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"The apparent freshness of the United States troops at\r\n    Centreville, which checked our pursuit; the strong forces\r\n    occupying the works near Georgetown, Arlington, and Alexandria;\r\n    the certainty, too, that General Patterson, if needed, would\r\n    reach Washington with his army of more than thirty thousand\r\n    sooner than we could; and the condition and inadequate means of\r\n    the army in ammunition, provisions, and transportation,\r\n    prevented any serious thoughts of advancing against the capital.\r\n\r\n    \"To the second question I reply that it has never been feasible\r\n    for the army to advance farther than it has done--to the line of\r\n    Fairfax Court-House, with its advanced posts at Upton's,\r\n    Munson's, and Mason's Hills. After a conference at Fairfax\r\n    Court-House with the three senior general officers, you\r\n    announced it to be impracticable to give this army the strength\r\n    which those officers considered necessary to enable it to assume\r\n    the offensive. Upon which I drew it back to its present\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    \"Most respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"J. E. Johnston.\"\r\n\r\nThis answer to my inquiry was conclusive as to the charge which had been\r\nindustriously circulated that I had prevented the immediate pursuit of\r\nthe enemy, and had obstructed active operations after the battle of\r\nManassas, and thus had caused the failure to reap the proper fruits of\r\nthe victory.\r\n\r\nNo specific inquiry was made by me as to the part I took in the\r\nconferences of the 21st and 22d of July, but a general reference was\r\nmade to them. The entire silence of General Johnston in regard to those\r\nconferences is noticeable from the fact that, while his answer was\r\nstrictly measured by the terms of my inquiry as to pursuit, he added a\r\nstatement about a conference at Fairfax Court-House, which occurred in\r\nthe autumn, say October, and could have had no relation to the question\r\nof pursuit of the enemy after the victory of Manassas, or other active\r\noperations therewith connected. The reasons stated in my letter for\r\nmaking an inquiry, naturally pointed to the conferences of the 21st and\r\n22d of July, but surely not to a conference held months subsequent to\r\nthe battle, and on a question quite different from that of hot pursuit.\r\nIn regard to the matter of this subsequent conference I shall have more\r\nto say hereafter.\r\n\r\nI left the field of Manassas, proud of the heroism of our troops in\r\nbattle, and of the conduct of the officers who led them. Anxious to\r\nrecognize the claim of the army on the gratitude of the country, it was\r\nmy pleasing duty to bear testimony to their merit in every available\r\nform. Those who left the field and did not return to share its glory, it\r\nwas wished, should only be remembered as exceptions proving a rule.\r\n\r\nWith all the information possessed at the time by the commanding\r\ngenerals, the propriety of maintaining our position, while seeking\r\nobjects more easily attained than the capture of the United States\r\ncapital, seemed to me so demonstrable as to require no other\r\njustification than the statements to which I have referred in connection\r\nwith the conference of the 22d of July. It would have seemed to me then,\r\nas it does now, to be less than was due to the energy and fortitude of\r\nour troops, to plead a want of transportation and supplies for a march\r\nof about twenty miles through a country which had not then been denuded\r\nby the ravages of war.\r\n\r\nUnder these impressions, and with such feelings, I wrote to General\r\nBeauregard as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Richmond, Virginia, _August 4, 1861._\r\n\r\n    \"General Beauregard, _Manassas, Virginia._\r\n\r\n    \"My Dear Sir: ... I think you are unjust to yourself in putting\r\n    your failure to pursue the enemy to Washington to the account of\r\n    short supplies of subsistence and transportation. Under the\r\n    circumstances of our army, and in the absence of the knowledge\r\n    since acquired, if indeed the statements be true, it would have\r\n    been extremely hazardous to have done more than was performed.\r\n    You will not fail to remember that, so far from knowing that the\r\n    enemy was routed, a large part of our forces was moved by you,\r\n    in the night of the 21st, to repel a supposed attack upon our\r\n    right, and that the next day's operations did not fully reveal\r\n    what has since been reported of the enemy's panic. Enough was\r\n    done for glory, and the measure of duty was full; let us rather\r\n    show the untaught that their desires are unreasonable, than, by\r\n    dwelling on possibilities recently developed, give form and\r\n    substance to the criticisms always easy to those who judge after\r\n    the event.\r\n\r\n    \"With sincere esteem, I am your friend,\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\nI had declared myself content and gratified with the conduct of the\r\ntroops and the officers, and supposed the generals, in recognition of my\r\nefforts to aid them by increasing their force and munitions, as well as\r\nby my abstinence from all interference with them upon the field, would\r\nhave neither cause nor motive to reflect upon me in their reports, and\r\nit was with equal surprise and regret that in this I found myself\r\nmistaken. General Johnston, in his report, represented the order to him\r\nto make a junction with General Beauregard as a movement left to his\r\ndiscretion, with the condition that, if made, he should first send his\r\nsick and baggage to Culpepper Court-House. I felt constrained to put\r\nupon his report when it was received the following endorsement:\r\n\r\n    \"The telegram referred to by General Johnston in this report as\r\n    received by him about one o'clock on the morning of the 18th of\r\n    July is inaccurately reported. The following is a copy:\r\n\r\n    \"'Richmond, _July 17, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"'General J. E. Johnston, _Winchester, Virginia_.\r\n\r\n    \"'General Beauregard is attacked. To strike the enemy a decisive\r\n    blow, a junction of all your effective force will be needed. If\r\n    practicable, make the movement, sending your sick and baggage to\r\n    Culpepper Court-House, either by railroad or by Warrenton. In\r\n    all the arrangements, exercise your discretion.\r\n\r\n    \"'S. Cooper, _Adjutant and Inspector-General_.'\r\n\r\n    \"The word 'after' is not found in the dispatch before the words\r\n    'sending your sick,' as is stated in the report; so that the\r\n    argument based on it requires no comment. The order to move 'if\r\n    practicable' had reference to General Johnston's letters of the\r\n    12th and 15th of July, representing the relative strength and\r\n    positions of the enemy under Patterson and of his own forces to\r\n    be such as to make it doubtful whether General Johnston had the\r\n    power to effect the movement.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of General Beauregard's report of the battle of\r\nManassas, I found that it contained matter which seemed to me out of\r\nplace, and therefore addressed to him the following letter:\r\n\r\n    \"Richmond, Virginia, _October 30, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"General Beauregard, _Manassas, Virginia_.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir: Yesterday my attention was called to various newspaper\r\n    publications purporting to have been sent from Manassas, and to\r\n    be a synopsis of your report of the battle of the 21st of July\r\n    last, and in which it is represented that you have been\r\n    overruled by me in your plan for a battle with the enemy south\r\n    of the Potomac, for the capture of Baltimore and Washington, and\r\n    the liberation of Maryland.\r\n\r\n    \"I inquired for your long-expected report, and it has been\r\n    to-day submitted to my inspection. It appears, by official\r\n    endorsement, to have been received by the Adjutant-General on\r\n    the 18th of October, though it is dated August 26, 1861.\r\n\r\n    \"With much surprise I found that the newspaper statements were\r\n    sustained by the text of your report. I was surprised, because,\r\n    if we did differ in opinion as to the measure and purposes of\r\n    contemplated campaigns, such fact could have no appropriate\r\n    place in the report of a battle; further, because it seemed to\r\n    be an attempt to exalt yourself at my expense; and, especially,\r\n    because no such plan as that described was submitted to me. It\r\n    is true that, some time before it was ordered, you expressed a\r\n    desire for the junction of General Johnston's army with your\r\n    own. The movement was postponed until the operations of the\r\n    enemy rendered it necessary, and until it became thereby\r\n    practicable to make it with safety to the Valley of Virginia.\r\n    Hence, I believe, was secured the success by which it was\r\n    attended.\r\n\r\n    \"If you have retained a copy of the plan of campaign which you\r\n    say was submitted to me through Colonel Chesnut, allow me to\r\n    request that you will furnish me with a duplicate of it.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Very respectfully yours, etc.,\"\r\n\r\n    (Signed)  \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\nAs General Beauregard did not think proper to omit that portion of his\r\nreport to which objection was made, it necessitated, when the entire\r\nreport was transmitted to Congress, the placing of an endorsement upon\r\nit, reviewing that part of the report which I considered objectionable.\r\nThe Congress, in its discretion, ordered the publication of the report,\r\nexcept that part to which the endorsement referred, thereby judiciously\r\nsuppressing both the endorsement and the portion of the report to which\r\nit related. In this case, and _every other_ official report ever\r\nsubmitted to me, I made neither alteration nor erasure.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the report which was suppressed by the Congress has,\r\nsince the war, found its way into the press, but the endorsement which\r\nbelonged to it has not been published. As part of the history of the\r\ntime, I will here present both in their proper connection:\r\n\r\n    \"General S. Cooper, _Adjutant and Inspector-General, Richmond\r\n    Virginia._\r\n\r\n    \"Before entering upon a narration of the general military\r\n    operations in the presence of the enemy on July 21st, I\r\n    propose--I hope not unreasonably--first to recite certain events\r\n    which belong to the strategy of the campaign, and consequently\r\n    form an essential part of the history of the battle.\r\n\r\n    \"Having become satisfied that the advance of the enemy with a\r\n    decidedly superior force, both as to numbers and war equipage,\r\n    to attack or turn my position in this quarter was immediately\r\n    impending, I dispatched, on July 13th, one of my staff, Colonel\r\n    James Chesnut, of South Carolina, to submit for the\r\n    consideration of the President a plan of operations\r\n    substantially as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"I proposed that General Johnston should unite, as soon as\r\n    possible, the bulk of the Army of the Shenandoah with that of\r\n    the Potomac, then under my command, leaving only sufficient\r\n    force to garrison his strong works at Winchester, and to guard\r\n    the five defensive passes of the Blue Ridge, and thus hold\r\n    Patterson in check. At the same time Brigadier-General Holmes\r\n    was to march hither with all of his command not essential for\r\n    the defense of the position of Acquia Creek. These junctions\r\n    having been effected at Manassas, an immediate, impetuous attack\r\n    of our combined armies upon General McDowell was to follow, as\r\n    soon as he approached my advanced position, at and around\r\n    Fairfax Court-House, with the inevitable result, as I submitted,\r\n    of his complete defeat, and the destruction or capture of his\r\n    army. This accomplished, the Army of the Shenandoah, under\r\n    General Johnston, increased with a part of my forces and\r\n    rejoined as he returned by the detachment left to hold the\r\n    mountain-passes, was to march back rapidly into the Valley, fall\r\n    upon and crush Patterson with a superior force, wheresoever he\r\n    might be found. This, I confidently estimated, could be achieved\r\n    within fifteen days after General Johnston should march from\r\n    Winchester for Manassas.\r\n\r\n    \"Meanwhile, I was to occupy the enemy's works on this side of\r\n    the Potomac, if, as I anticipated, he had been so routed as to\r\n    enable me to enter them with him or, if not, to retire again for\r\n    a time within the lines of Bull Run with my main force.\r\n    Patterson having been virtually destroyed, then General Johnston\r\n    would reënforce General Garnett sufficiently to make him\r\n    superior to his opponent (General McClellan) and able to defeat\r\n    that officer. This done, General Garnett was to form an\r\n    immediate junction with General Johnston, who was forthwith to\r\n    cross the Potomac into Maryland with his whole force, arouse the\r\n    people as he advanced to the recovery of their political rights,\r\n    and the defense of their homes and families from an offensive\r\n    invader, and then march to the investment of Washington, in the\r\n    rear, while I resumed the offensive in front. This plan of\r\n    operations, you are aware, was not acceptable at the time, from\r\n    considerations which appeared so weighty as to more than\r\n    counterbalance its proposed advantages. Informed of these views,\r\n    and of the decision of the War Department, I then made my\r\n    preparations for the stoutest practicable defense of the line of\r\n    Bull Run, the enemy having developed his purpose, by the advance\r\n    on and occupation of Fairfax Court-House, from which my advance\r\n    brigade had been withdrawn.\r\n\r\n    \"The War Department having been informed by me, by telegraph on\r\n    July 17th, of the movement of General McDowell, General Johnston\r\n    was immediately ordered to form a junction of his army corps\r\n    with mine, should the movement in his judgment be deemed\r\n    advisable. General Holmes was also directed to push forward with\r\n    two regiments, a battery, and one company of cavalry.\"[179]\r\n\r\n    \"ENDORSEMENT.\r\n\r\n    \"The order issued by the War Department to General Johnston was\r\n    not, as herein reported, to form a junction, 'should the\r\n    movement in his judgment be deemed advisable.' The following is\r\n    an accurate copy of the order:\r\n\r\n    \"'General Beauregard is attacked. To strike the enemy a decisive\r\n    blow, a junction of all your effective force will be needed. If\r\n    practicable, make the movement, sending your sick and baggage to\r\n    Culpepper Court-House, either by railroad or by Warrenton. In\r\n    all the arrangements, exercise your discretion.'\r\n\r\n    \"The words 'if practicable' had reference to letters of General\r\n    Johnston of the 12th and 15th of July, which made it extremely\r\n    doubtful if he had the power to make the movement, in view of\r\n    the relative strength and position of Patterson's forces as\r\n    compared with his own.\r\n\r\n    \"The plan of campaign reported to have been submitted, but not\r\n    accepted, and to have led to a decision of the War Department,\r\n    can not be found among its files, nor any reference to any\r\n    decision made upon it; and it was not known that the army had\r\n    advanced beyond the line of Bull Run, the position previously\r\n    selected by General Lee, and which was supposed to have\r\n    continued to be the defensive line occupied by the main body of\r\n    our forces. Inquiry has developed the fact that a message, to be\r\n    verbally delivered, was sent by Hon. Mr. Chesnut. If the\r\n    conjectures recited in the report were entertained, they rested\r\n    on the accomplishment of one great condition, namely, that a\r\n    junction of the forces of Generals Johnston and Holmes should be\r\n    made with the army of General Beauregard and should gain a\r\n    victory. The junction was made, the victory was won; but the\r\n    consequences that were predicted did not result. The reasons why\r\n    no such consequences could result are given in the closing\r\n    passages of the reports of both the commanding generals, and the\r\n    responsibility can not be transferred to the Government at\r\n    Richmond, which certainly would have united in any feasible plan\r\n    to accomplish such desirable results.\r\n\r\n    \"If the plan of campaign mentioned in the report had been\r\n    presented in a written communication, and in sufficient detail\r\n    to permit proper investigation, it must have been pronounced to\r\n    be impossible at that time, and its proposal could only have\r\n    been accounted for by the want of information of the forces and\r\n    positions of the armies in the field. The facts that rendered it\r\n    impossible are the following:\r\n\r\n    \"1. It was based, as related from memory by Colonel Chesnut, on\r\n    the supposition of drawing a force of about twenty-five thousand\r\n    men from the command of General Johnston. The letters of General\r\n    Johnston show his effective force to have been only eleven\r\n    thousand, with an enemy thirty thousand strong in his front,\r\n    ready to take possession of the Valley of Virginia on his\r\n    withdrawal.\r\n\r\n    \"2. It proposed to continue operations by effecting a junction\r\n    of a part of the victorious forces with the army of General\r\n    Garnett in Western Virginia. General Garnett's forces amounted\r\n    only to three or four thousand men, then known to be in rapid\r\n    retreat before vastly superior forces under McClellan, and the\r\n    news that he was himself killed and his army scattered arrived\r\n    within forty-eight hours of Colonel Chesnut's arrival in\r\n    Richmond.\r\n\r\n    \"3. The plan was based on the improbable and inadmissible\r\n    supposition that the enemy was to await everywhere, isolated and\r\n    motionless, until our forces could effect junctions to attack\r\n    them in detail.\r\n\r\n    \"4. It could not be expected that any success obtainable on the\r\n    battle-field would enable our forces to carry the fortifications\r\n    on the Potomac, garrisoned, and within supporting distance of\r\n    fresh troops; nor after the actual battle and victory did the\r\n    generals on the field propose an advance on the capital, nor\r\n    does it appear that they have since believed themselves in a\r\n    condition to attempt such a movement.\r\n\r\n    \"It is proper also to observe that there is no communication on\r\n    file in the War Department, as recited at the close of the\r\n    report, showing what were the causes which prevented the advance\r\n    of our forces and prolonged, vigorous pursuit of the enemy to\r\n    and beyond the Potomac.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\nIt has not been my purpose to describe the battles of the war. To the\r\nreports of the officers serving on the field, in the armies of both\r\nGovernments, the student of history must turn for knowledge of the\r\ndetails, and it will be the task of the future historian, from\r\ncomparison of the whole, to deduce the truth.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate for the cause of justice that error and\r\nmisrepresentation have, in their inconsistencies and improbabilities,\r\nthe elements of self-destruction, while truth is in its nature\r\nconsistent and therefore self-sustaining. To such general remarks in\r\nregard to campaigns, sieges, and battles as may seem to me appropriate\r\nto the scope and object of my work, I shall append or insert, from time\r\nto time, the evidence of reliable actors in those affairs, as well to\r\nelucidate obscurity as to correct error.\r\n\r\nFrom the official reports it appears that the strength of the two armies\r\nwas: Confederate, 30,167 men of all arms, with 29 guns;[180] Federal,\r\n35,732 men,[181] with a body of cavalry, of which only one company is\r\nreported, and a large artillery force not shown in the tabular\r\nstatement. Of these troops, some on both sides were not engaged in the\r\nbattle. This, it is believed, was the case to a much larger extent on\r\nour side than on that of the enemy. He selected the point of attack, and\r\ncould concentrate his troops for that purpose, but we were guarding a\r\nline of some seven miles front, and therefore widely dispersed.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose above stated, extracts are herein inserted from a\r\nnarrative in the \"Operations on the Line of Bull Run in June and July,\r\n1861, including the First Battle of Manassas.\" The name of the author,\r\nJ. A. Early, will, to all who know him, be a sufficient guarantee for\r\nthe accuracy of the statements, and for the justice of the conclusions\r\nannounced. To those who do not know him, it may be proper to state that\r\nhe was educated as a soldier; after leaving the army became a lawyer,\r\nbut, when his country was involved in war with Mexico, he volunteered\r\nand served in a regiment of his native State, Virginia. After that war\r\nterminated, he returned to the practice of his profession, which he was\r\nactively pursuing when the controversy between the sections caused the\r\ncall of a convention to decide whether Virginia should secede from the\r\nUnion. He was sent, by the people of the county in which he resided, to\r\nrepresent them in that convention. There he opposed to the last the\r\nadoption of the ordinance for secession; but, when it was decided,\r\nagainst his opinion, to resort to the remedy of withdrawal from the\r\nUnion, he, true to his allegiance to the State of which he was a\r\ncitizen, paused not to cavil or protest, but at once stepped forth to\r\ndefend her against a threatened invasion. The sword that had rusted in\r\npeace gleamed brightly in war. He rose to the high grade of\r\nlieutenant-general. None have a more stainless record as a soldier, none\r\nhave shown a higher patriotism or purer fidelity through all the bitter\r\ntrials to which we have been subjected since open war was ended and\r\nnominal peace began.\r\n\r\nExtracts from the narrative of General J. A. Early, of events occurring\r\nwhen he was colonel of the Twenty-fourth Regiment of Virginia Infantry\r\nand commanding a brigade:\r\n\r\n    \"On June 19, 1861, I arrived at Manassas Junction and reported\r\n    to General P. G. T. Beauregard, the Twenty-fourth Virginia\r\n    Regiment having been previously sent to him, under the command\r\n    of Lieutenant-Colonel Hairsten, from Lynchburg, where I had been\r\n    stationed under the orders of General Robert E. Lee, for the\r\n    purpose of organizing the Virginia troops which were being\r\n    mustered into service at that place....\r\n\r\n    \"On the morning of July 18th, my brigade was moved, by order of\r\n    General Beauregard, to the left of Camp Walker, on the railroad,\r\n    and remained there some time....\r\n\r\n    \"On falling back, General Ewell, in pursuance of his\r\n    instructions, had burned the bridges on the railroad over Pope's\r\n    Run, from Fairfax Station to Union Mills, and while I was at\r\n    Camp Walker I saw the smoke ascending from the railroad-bridge\r\n    over Bull Run, which was burned that morning.\r\n\r\n    \"The burning of this bridge had not been included in the\r\n    previous instructions to Ewell, and I have always been at a loss\r\n    to know why it was now fired. That bridge certainly was not\r\n    necessary to the enemy for crossing Bull Run, either with his\r\n    troops or wagons, as that stream was easily fordable at numerous\r\n    places, both above and below. The bridge was, moreover,\r\n    susceptible of easy defense, as there were deep cuts leading to\r\n    it on both sides. The only possible purpose to be subserved by\r\n    the burning of that bridge would have been the prevention for a\r\n    short time of the running of trains over it by the enemy, in the\r\n    event of our defeat, or evacuation of Manassas without a fight.\r\n    As it was, we were afterward greatly inconvenienced by its\r\n    destruction.\" ...\r\n\r\nThe attack made on the 18th is described as directed against our right\r\ncenter, and as having been met and repulsed in a manner quite creditable\r\nto our raw troops, of whom he writes:\r\n\r\n    \"On the 19th they were occupied in the effort to strengthen\r\n    their position by throwing up the best defenses they could with\r\n    the implements at hand, which consisted of a very few picks and\r\n    spades, some rough bowie-knives, and the bayonets of the\r\n    muskets.... The position was a very weak one, as the banks on\r\n    the opposite side of Bull Run overlooked and commanded those on\r\n    the south side, which were but a few feet above the water's\r\n    edge, and there was an open field in rear of the strip of woods\r\n    on our side of the stream, for a considerable distance up and\r\n    down it, which exposed all of our movements on that side to\r\n    observation from the opposite one, as the strip of woods\r\n    afforded but a thin veil which could be seen through....\r\n\r\n    \"About dusk on the 19th, brigade commanders were summoned to a\r\n    conference at McLean's house by General Beauregard, and he then\r\n    informed us of the fact that General Johnston had been ordered,\r\n    at his instance, from the Valley, and was marching to coöperate\r\n    with us. He stated that Johnston would march directly across the\r\n    Blue Ridge toward the enemy's right flank, and would probably\r\n    attack on that flank at dawn the next morning. Before he had\r\n    finished his statement of the plans he proposed pursuing in the\r\n    event of Johnston's attack on the enemy's right flank, a party\r\n    of horsemen rode up in front of the house, and, dismounting, one\r\n    of them walked in and reported himself as Brigadier-General T.\r\n    J. Jackson, who had arrived with the advanced brigade of\r\n    Johnston's troops by the way of Manassas Gap Railroad, and he\r\n    stated that his brigade was about twenty-five hundred strong.\r\n    This information took General Beauregard very much by surprise,\r\n    and, after ascertaining that General Jackson had taken the cars\r\n    at Piedmont Station, General Beauregard asked him if General\r\n    Johnston would not march the rest of his command on the direct\r\n    road, so as to get on the enemy's right flank. General Jackson\r\n    replied with some little hesitation, and, as I thought at the\r\n    time, in rather a stolid manner, that he thought not; that he\r\n    thought the purpose was to transport the whole force by railroad\r\n    from Piedmont Station. This was the first time I ever saw\r\n    General Jackson, and my first impressions of him were not very\r\n    favorable from the manner in which he gave his information. I\r\n    subsequently ascertained very well how it was that he seemed to\r\n    know so little, in the presence of the strangers among whom he\r\n    found himself, of General Johnston's intended movements, and I\r\n    presume nothing but the fact of General Beauregard being his\r\n    superior in rank, and his being ordered to report to him, could\r\n    have elicited as much information from him, under the\r\n    circumstances, as was obtained. After General Jackson had given\r\n    the information above stated, and received instructions where to\r\n    put his brigade, he retired, and General Beauregard proceeded to\r\n    develop fully his plans for the next day. The information\r\n    received from General Jackson was wholly unexpected, but General\r\n    Beauregard said he thought Jackson was not correctly informed,\r\n    and was mistaken; that he was satisfied General Johnston was\r\n    marching with the rest of his troops and would attack the\r\n    enemy's right flank early next day as he had before stated. Upon\r\n    this hypothesis, he directed that when General Johnston's attack\r\n    began and he had become fully engaged, of which we were to judge\r\n    from the character of the musketry-fire, we should cross Bull\r\n    Run from our several positions, and move upon the enemy so as to\r\n    attack him on his left flank and rear. He said that he had no\r\n    doubt General Johnston's attack would be a complete surprise to\r\n    the enemy; that the latter would not know what to think of it;\r\n    that when he turned to meet that attack, and soon found himself\r\n    assailed on the other side, he would be still more surprised and\r\n    would not know what to do; that the effect would become a\r\n    complete rout--a perfect Waterloo; and that, when the enemy took\r\n    to flight, we would pursue, cross the Potomac, and arouse\r\n    Maryland....\r\n\r\n    \"During the 20th General Johnston arrived at Manassas Junction\r\n    by the railroad, and that day we received the order from him\r\n    assuming command of the combined armies of General Beauregard\r\n    and himself.\r\n\r\n    \"Early on the morning of the 21st (Sunday), we heard the enemy's\r\n    guns open from the heights north of Bull Run, from which they\r\n    had opened on the 18th, and I soon received orders for the\r\n    movement of my brigade....\r\n\r\n    \"Upon arriving there (McLean's Ford), I found General Jones had\r\n    returned to the intrenchments with his brigade, and I was\r\n    informed by him that General Beauregard had directed that I\r\n    should join him (General Beauregard) with my brigade.... He then\r\n    asked me if I had received an order from General Beauregard to\r\n    go to him, and, on my replying in the negative, he informed me\r\n    that he had such an order for me in a note to him. He sent to\r\n    one of his staff-officers for the note, and showed it to me. The\r\n    note was one directing him to fall back behind Bull Run, and was\r\n    in pencil. At the foot of it were these words: 'Send Early to\r\n    me.' This was all the order that I received to move to the left,\r\n    and it was shown to me a very little after twelve o'clock....\r\n    Chisholm, who carried the note to Jones, in which was contained\r\n    the order I received, passed me at McLean's Ford going on to\r\n    Jones about, or a little after, eleven o'clock. If I had not\r\n    received the order until 2 P. M., it would have been impossible\r\n    for me to get on the field at the time I reached it, about 3.30\r\n    P. M. Colonel Chisholm informed me that the order was for all\r\n    the troops to fall back across Bull Run.... I was met by Colonel\r\n    John S. Preston, one of the General's aides, who informed me\r\n    that General Beauregard had gone where the fighting was ... but\r\n    that General Johnston was just in front, and his directions were\r\n    that we should proceed to the left, where there was a heavy fire\r\n    of musketry.... When we reached General Johnston, he expressed\r\n    great gratification at our arrival, but it was very perceptible\r\n    that his anticipations were not sanguine. He gave me special\r\n    instructions as to my movements, directing me to clear our lines\r\n    completely before going to the front.... In some fields on the\r\n    left of our line we found Colonel Stuart with a body of cavalry\r\n    and some pieces of artillery, belonging, as I understood, to a\r\n    battery commanded by Lieutenant Beckham.... I found Stuart\r\n    already in position beyond our extreme left, and, as I\r\n    understood it, supporting and controlling Beckham's guns, which\r\n    were firing on the enemy's extreme right flank, thus rendering\r\n    very efficient service. I feel well assured that Stuart had but\r\n    _two_ companies of cavalry with him, as these were all I saw\r\n    when he afterward went in pursuit of the enemy. As I approached\r\n    the left, a young man named Saunders came galloping to me from\r\n    Stuart with the information that the enemy was about retreating,\r\n    and a request to hurry on. This was the first word of\r\n    encouragement we had received since we reached the vicinity of\r\n    the battle. I told the messenger to inform Stuart that I was\r\n    then moving as rapidly as my men could move; but he soon\r\n    returned with another message informing me that the other was a\r\n    mistake, that the enemy had merely retired behind the ridge in\r\n    front to form a new flanking column, and cautioning me to be on\r\n    my guard. This last information proved to be correct. It was the\r\n    last effort of the enemy to extend his right beyond our left,\r\n    and was met by the formation of my regiments in his front....\r\n    The hill on which the enemy's troops were was Chinn's Hill, so\r\n    often referred to in the accounts of this battle, and the one\r\n    next year, on the same field.... An officer came to me in a\r\n    gallop, and entreated me not to fire on the troops in front, and\r\n    I was so much impressed by his earnest manner and confident\r\n    tone, that I halted my brigade on the side of the hill, and rode\r\n    to the top of it, when I discovered, about a hundred and fifty\r\n    yards to my right, a regiment bearing a flag which was drooping\r\n    around the staff in such a manner as not to be distinguishable\r\n    from the Confederate flag of that day. I thought that, if the\r\n    one that had been in front of me was a Virginia regiment, this\r\n    must also be a Confederate one; but one or two shots from\r\n    Beckham's guns on the left caused the regiment to face about,\r\n    when its flag unfurled, and I discovered it to be the United\r\n    States flag. I forthwith ordered my brigade forward, but it did\r\n    not reach the top of the hill soon enough to do any damage to\r\n    the retiring regiment, which retreated precipitately down the\r\n    hill and across the Warrenton Pike. At that time there was very\r\n    little distinction between the dress of some of the Federal\r\n    regiments and some of ours. As soon as the misrepresentation in\r\n    regard to the character of the troops was corrected, my brigade\r\n    advanced to the top of the hill that had been occupied by the\r\n    enemy, and we ascertained that his troops had retired\r\n    precipitately, and a large body of them was discovered in the\r\n    fields in rear of Dogan's house, and north of the turnpike.\r\n    Colonel Cocke, with one of his regiments, now joined us, and our\r\n    pieces of artillery were advanced and fired upon the enemy's\r\n    columns with considerable effect, causing them to disperse, and\r\n    we soon discovered that they were in full retreat.... When my\r\n    column was seen by General Beauregard, he at first thought it\r\n    was a column of the enemy, having received erroneous information\r\n    that such a column was on the Manassas Gap Railroad. The enemy\r\n    took my troops, as they approached his right, for a large body\r\n    of our troops from the Valley; and as my men, moving by flank,\r\n    were stretched out at considerable length, from weariness, they\r\n    were greatly over-estimated. We scared the enemy worse than we\r\n    hurt him....\r\n\r\n    \"We saw the evidences of the flight all along our march, and\r\n    unmistakable indications of the overwhelming character of the\r\n    enemy's defeat in abandoned muskets and equipments. It was\r\n    impossible for me to pursue the enemy farther, as well because I\r\n    was utterly unacquainted with the crossings of the Run and the\r\n    woods in front, as because most of the men belonging to my\r\n    brigade had been marching the greater part of the day and were\r\n    very much exhausted. But pursuit with infantry would have been\r\n    unavailing, as the enemy's troops retreated with such rapidity\r\n    that they could not have been overtaken by any other than\r\n    mounted troops. On the next day we found a great many articles\r\n    that the routed troops had abandoned in their flight, showing\r\n    that no expense or trouble had been spared by the enemy in\r\n    equipping his army.... In my movement after the retreat of the\r\n    enemy commenced, I passed the Carter house and beyond our line\r\n    of battle. The enemy had by this time entirely disappeared, and,\r\n    having no knowledge of the country whatever, being on the ground\r\n    for the first time, besides not observing any movement of troops\r\n    from our line, I halted, with the expectation of receiving\r\n    further orders. Observing some men near the Carter house, I rode\r\n    to it, and found some five or six Federal soldiers, who had\r\n    collected some wounded there of both sides, and among them\r\n    Colonel Gardner, of the Eighth Georgia Regiment, who was\r\n    suffering from a very painful wound in the leg, which was\r\n    fractured just above the ankle.... Just after my return from the\r\n    house where I saw Colonel Gardner, President Davis, in company\r\n    with several gentlemen, rode to where my command was, and\r\n    addressed a few stirring remarks to my regiments, in succession,\r\n    which received him with great enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n    \"I briefly informed Mr. Davis of the orders I had received, and\r\n    the movements of my brigade, and asked him what I should do\r\n    under the circumstances. He told me that I had better get my men\r\n    into line, and wait for further orders. I then requested him to\r\n    inform Generals Johnston and Beauregard of my position, and my\r\n    desire to receive orders. I also informed him of the condition\r\n    in which I had found Colonel Gardner, and also of Colonel Jones\r\n    being in the neighborhood badly wounded, requesting him to have\r\n    a surgeon sent to their relief, as all of mine were in the rear\r\n    attending to the wounded of their regiments. While we were\r\n    talking, we saw a body of troops moving on the opposite side of\r\n    Bull Run, some distance below us.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Davis then left me, going to the house where Colonel\r\n    Gardner was, and I moved my brigade some half a mile farther,\r\n    and formed it in line across the peninsula formed by a very\r\n    considerable bend in Bull Run above the stone bridge. I put out\r\n    a line of pickets in front, and my brigade bivouacked in this\r\n    position for the night. By the time all these dispositions were\r\n    made it was night, and I then rode back with Captain Gardner\r\n    over the route I had moved on, as I knew no other, in order to\r\n    find General Johnston or General Beauregard, so that I might\r\n    receive orders, supposing that there would be a forward movement\r\n    early in the morning. I first went to the Lewis house, which I\r\n    found to be a hospital filled with wounded men; but was unable\r\n    to get any information about either of the generals. I then rode\r\n    toward Manassas, and, after going some distance in that\r\n    direction, I met an officer who inquired for General Johnston,\r\n    stating that he was on his staff. I informed him that I was\r\n    looking for General Johnston also, as well as for General\r\n    Beauregard, and supposed they were at Manassas; but he said that\r\n    he was just from Manassas, and neither of the generals was\r\n    there.... At about twelve o'clock at night I lay down in the\r\n    field in rear of my command, on a couple of bundles of wheat in\r\n    the straw. My men had no rations with them. I had picked up a\r\n    haversack on the field, which was filled with hard biscuits, and\r\n    had been dropped by some Yankee in his flight, and out of its\r\n    contents I made my own supper, distributing the rest among a\r\n    number of officers who had nothing.\r\n\r\n    \"Very early next morning, I sent Captain Gardner to look out for\r\n    the generals, and get orders for my command. He went to\r\n    Manassas, and found General Beauregard, who sent orders to me to\r\n    remain where I was until further orders, and to send for the\r\n    camp-equipage, rations, etc., of my command. A number of the men\r\n    spread over the country in the vicinity of the battlefield, and\r\n    picked up a great many knapsacks, India-rubber cloths, blankets,\r\n    overcoats, etc., as well as a good deal of sugar, coffee, and\r\n    other provisions that had been abandoned by the enemy....\r\n\r\n    \"After I had received orders showing that there was no purpose\r\n    to make a forward movement, I rode over a good deal of the\r\n    field, north of the Warrenton pike, and to some hospitals in the\r\n    vicinity, in order to see what care was being taken of the\r\n    wounded. I found a hospital on the Sudley road, back of the\r\n    field of battle, at which Colonel Jones, of the Fourth Alabama,\r\n    had been, which was in charge of a surgeon of a Rhode Island\r\n    regiment, whose name was Harris, I think. I asked him if he had\r\n    what he wanted for the men under his care, and he told me he\r\n    would like to have some morphine, of which his supply was short.\r\n    I directed a young surgeon of our cavalry, who rode up at the\r\n    time, to furnish the morphine, which he did, from a pair of\r\n    medical saddle-pockets which he had. Dr. Harris told me that he\r\n    knew that their troops had had a great deal of coffee and sugar\r\n    mixed, ready for boiling, of which a good deal had been left at\r\n    different points near the field, and asked if there would be any\r\n    objection to his sending out and gathering some of it for the\r\n    use of the wounded under his charge, as it would be of much\r\n    service to them. I gave him the permission to get not only that,\r\n    but anything else that would tend to the comfort of his\r\n    patients. There did not come within my observation any instance\r\n    of harsh or unkind treatment of the enemy's wounded; nor did I\r\n    see any indication of a spirit to extend such treatment to them.\r\n    The stories which were afterward told before the Committee on\r\n    the Conduct of the War (appointed by the Federal Congress), in\r\n    regard to 'rebel atrocities,' were very grossly exaggerated, or\r\n    manufactured from the whole cloth....\r\n\r\n    \"On the night following the battle, when I was looking for\r\n    Generals Beauregard and Johnston, in riding over and to the rear\r\n    of the battle-field, I discovered that the greater part of the\r\n    troops that had been engaged in the battle were in a great state\r\n    of confusion. I saw companies looking for their regiments, and\r\n    squads looking for their companies, and they were scattered as\r\n    far as I went toward Manassas. It was very apparent that no\r\n    considerable body of those troops that had been engaged on the\r\n    left could have been brought into a condition next day for an\r\n    advance toward Washington....\r\n\r\n    \"The dispute as to who planned the battle, or commanded on the\r\n    field, General Johnston or General Beauregard, is a most\r\n    unprofitable one. The battle which General Beauregard planned\r\n    was never fought, because the enemy did not move as he expected\r\n    him to move. The battle which was fought was planned by\r\n    McDowell, at least so far as the ground on which it was fought\r\n    was concerned. He made a movement on our left which was wholly\r\n    unexpected and unprovided for, and we were compelled to fight a\r\n    defensive battle on that flank, by bringing up reënforcements\r\n    from other points as rapidly as possible. When Generals Johnston\r\n    and Beauregard arrived on the field where the battle was\r\n    actually fought, it had been progressing for some time, with the\r\n    odds greatly against us. What was required then was to rally the\r\n    troops already engaged, which had been considerably shattered,\r\n    and hold the position to which they had been compelled to retire\r\n    until reënforcements could be brought up. According to the\r\n    statements of both generals, the command of the troops then on\r\n    the field was given to General Beauregard, and he continued to\r\n    exercise it until the close, but in subordination, of course, to\r\n    General Johnston, as commander-in-chief, while the movements of\r\n    all the reënforcements as they arrived were unquestionably\r\n    directed by the latter. According to the statement of both, the\r\n    movement of Elzey's brigade to the left averted a great danger,\r\n    and both concur in attributing the turning of the tide of battle\r\n    to the movement of my brigade against the enemy's extreme right\r\n    flank (General Beauregard in a letter on the origin of the\r\n    battle-flag, and General Johnston in his 'Narrative' recently\r\n    published).\r\n\r\n    \"General Beauregard unquestionably performed the duty assigned\r\n    him with great ability, and General Johnston gives him full\r\n    credit therefor. Where, then, is there any room for a\r\n    controversy in regard to the actual command, and what profit can\r\n    there be in it?\r\n\r\n    \"General Johnston assumes the responsibility for the failure to\r\n    advance on Washington, and why, then, should an effort be made\r\n    to shift it on any one else? He certainly was\r\n    commander-in-chief, and had the privilege of advancing if he\r\n    thought proper. The attempt to show that the failure to advance\r\n    was due to the want of transportation and rations for the army\r\n    is idle. If the Bull Run bridge had not been burned on the 18th,\r\n    our supplies could have been run to Alexandria, if we could have\r\n    advanced, as easily as to Manassas, for the enemy had repaired\r\n    the railroad to Fairfax Station as he moved up, and failed to\r\n    destroy it when he went back. Moreover, we had abundant\r\n    transportation at that time for all the purposes of an advance\r\n    as far as Washington. In my brigade, the two Virginia regiments\r\n    had about fourteen six-horse wagons each, and that would have\r\n    furnished enough for the brigade, if the Seventh Louisiana had\r\n    none. In 1862 we carried into Maryland only enough wagons to\r\n    convey ammunition, medical supplies, and cooking-utensils, and\r\n    we started from the battle-field of second Manassas with no\r\n    rations on hand, being, before we crossed the Potomac, entirely\r\n    dependent on the country, which, in July, 1861, was teeming with\r\n    supplies, but in August and September, 1862, was nearly\r\n    depleted. The pretense, therefore, that the advance in July,\r\n    1861, was prevented by the want of transportation and of\r\n    supplies is wholly untenable.\"\r\n\r\nI will now make the promised extracts from reminiscences of Colonel\r\n(then Captain) Lay, which were sent to a friend, and handed to me for my\r\nuse. The paper bears date February 13, 1878. After some preliminary\r\nmatter, and stating that his force consisted of three cavalry companies,\r\nthe narrative proceeds:\r\n\r\n    \"I was under orders to be in the saddle at 6.30 A. M., July 21,\r\n    1861, and to report immediately to General Beauregard at his\r\n    headquarters. About 7.30 A. M. I accompanied him and General\r\n    Johnston to a position near to Mitchell's Ford, where for some\r\n    hours we remained under an active fire of the long-range guns of\r\n    the enemy upon the opposite hills. When the unexpected flank\r\n    movement of the enemy was developed, with the generals named, we\r\n    rode at rapid speed to the left, when General Beauregard\r\n    immediately rode to the front, General Johnston taking position\r\n    near and to the left of the Lewis house.... About 3.15 P. M.,\r\n    Captain R. Lindsey Walker, with his battery, took position to\r\n    the left and in front of the Lewis house and commenced firing. I\r\n    was near him when the shot from his battery was fired, and\r\n    watched its effect as it swept through the columns of the enemy,\r\n    producing perfect confusion and demoralization.... I rode to\r\n    join my brother, Colonel Lay, whom I saw going toward my command\r\n    from General Johnston. He reported to me that General Johnston\r\n    said: 'Now is your time; push the pursuit.' I started at once on\r\n    a trot, was passing General Johnston, who gave some orders, and\r\n    I understood him to say, 'Salute the President in passing.' ...\r\n    I saluted, and passed on at a gallop.\r\n\r\n    \"I halted at Bull Run to water my horses--then suffering--and to\r\n    confer a moment or two with my gallant old commander, General\r\n    Philip St. George Cocke.\r\n\r\n    \"I passed on, ... when to my astonishment I saw the President\r\n    near me in the orchard. I immediately rode up to him, and said\r\n    that he was much farther forward than he should be; that the\r\n    forces of the enemy were not entirely broken, and very few of\r\n    our troops in front of the Run, and advised him to retire; that\r\n    I was then about to charge....\r\n\r\n    \"We made the charge; a small body of the enemy broke before we\r\n    reached them, and scattered, and the larger body of troops\r\n    beyond proved to be of our own troops rapidly advancing upon our\r\n    left.... After parting from the President, I pushed on to Sudley\r\n    Church, and far beyond. Sent my surgeon, Dr. Randolph Barksdale,\r\n    to Captains Tillinghast, Ricketts, and other badly wounded\r\n    United States officers, and was going on until a superior force\r\n    should stop me, but was recalled by an order and returned over\r\n    the field to my quarters at Manassas a little before daylight--I\r\n    and my little gallant squadron--having been actively in the\r\n    saddle, I think, more than twenty hours....\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"John F.

Cabell,\r\nstates in a letter written at Dallas, Texas, on the 16th of August,\r\n1880, in regard to the field transportation of General Beauregard's\r\nforces before the battle of Manassas, that as nearly as he could\r\nremember it was as follows, viz.:\r\n\r\n  One four-horse wagon to each company.\r\n  One  \"     \"     \"   for field and staff (regimental).\r\n  One  \"     \"     \"    \"  ammunition.\r\n  One  \"     \"     \"    \"  hospital purposes.\r\n  Two  \"     \"   wagons \"  each battery of artillery.\r\n  Twenty-five wagons in a train for depot purposes.\r\n  One ambulance for each regiment.\r\n\r\nTransportation belonging to General Johnston's army did not arrive until\r\nthe day (or probably two days) after the battle.\r\n\r\nIf General Johnston, as stated, had nine thousand infantry, the field\r\ntransportation reported above could surely have been distributed so as\r\nto supply this additional force, and have rendered, as General Early\r\nstates, the pretense wholly untenable that the advance in July, 1861,\r\nwas prevented by want of transportation.\r\n\r\nThe deep anxiety which had existed, and was justified by the\r\ncircumstances, had corresponding gratification among all classes and in\r\nall sections of our country. On the day after the victory, the Congress,\r\nthen sitting in Richmond, upon receiving the dispatch of the President\r\nfrom the field of Manassas, adopted resolutions expressive of their\r\nthanks to the most high God, and inviting the people of the Confederate\r\nStates to offer up their united thanksgiving and praise for the mighty\r\ndeliverance. The resolutions also deplored the necessity which had\r\ncaused the soil of our country to be stained with the blood of its sons,\r\nand to their families and friends offered the most cordial sympathy;\r\nassuring them that in the hearts of our people would be enshrined \"the\r\nnames of the gallant dead as the champions of free and constitutional\r\nliberty.\"\r\n\r\nIf universal gratulation at our success inspired an overweening\r\nconfidence, it also begat increased desire to enter the military\r\nservice; and, but for our want of arms and munitions, we could have\r\nenrolled an army little short of the number of able-bodied men in the\r\nConfederate States.\r\n\r\nI have given so much space to the battle of Manassas because it was the\r\nfirst great action of the war, exciting intense feeling, and producing\r\nimportant moral results among the people of the Confederacy; and\r\nfurther, because it was made the basis of misrepresentation, and unjust\r\nreflection upon the chief Executive, which certainly had no plausible\r\npretext in the facts, and can not be referred to a reasonable desire to\r\npromote the successful defense of our country.\r\n\r\nImpressed with the conviction that time would naturally work to our\r\ndisadvantage, as training was more necessary to make soldiers of the\r\nNorthern people than of our own; and further, because of their larger\r\npopulation, as well as their greater facility in obtaining recruits from\r\nforeign countries, the Administration continued assiduously to exert\r\nevery faculty to increase the efficiency of the army by addition to its\r\nnumbers, by improving its organization, and by supplying the needful\r\nmunitions and equipments. Inactivity is the prolific source of evil to\r\nan army, especially if composed of new levies, who, like ours, had\r\nhurried from their homes at their country's call. For these, and other\r\nreasons more readily appreciated, it was thought desirable that all our\r\navailable forces should be employed as actively as might be practicable.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of August, 1861, I wrote to General J. E. Johnston, at\r\nManassas, as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"We are anxiously looking for the official reports of the battle\r\n    of Manassas, and have present need to know what supplies and\r\n    wagons were captured. I wish you would have prepared a statement\r\n    of your wants in transportation and supplies of all kinds, to\r\n    put your army on a proper footing for active operations....\r\n\r\n    \"I am, as ever, your friend,\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: The foregoing was copied from \"The Land we Love,\" for\r\nFebruary, 1867 (vol. ii, No. 4).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: General Beauregard's report.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: General McDowell's return, July 16, 17, 1861.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n    The Kentucky Resolutions of 1798-'99.--Their Influence on\r\n    Political Affairs.--Kentucky declares for\r\n    Neutrality.--Correspondence of Governor Magoffin with the\r\n    President of the United States and the President of the\r\n    Confederate States.--Occupation of Columbus, Kentucky, by\r\n    Major-General Polk.--His Correspondence with the Kentucky\r\n    Commissioners.--President Lincoln's View of Neutrality.--Acts of\r\n    the United States Government.--Refugees.--Their Motives of\r\n    Expatriation.--Address of ex-Vice-President Breckinridge to the\r\n    People of the State.--The Occupation of Columbus secured.--The\r\n    Purpose of the United States Government.--Battle of\r\n    Belmont.--Albert Sidney Johnston commands the Department.--State\r\n    of Affairs.--Line of Defense.-Efforts to obtain Arms; also\r\n    Troops.\r\n\r\n\r\nKentucky, the eldest daughter of Virginia, had moved contemporaneously\r\nwith her mother in the assertion of the cardinal principles announced in\r\nthe resolutions of 1798-'99. She then by the properly constituted\r\nauthority did with due solemnity declare that the Government of the\r\nUnited States was the result of a compact between the States to which\r\neach acceded as a State; that it possessed only delegated powers, of\r\nwhich it was not the exclusive or final judge; and that, as in all cases\r\nof compact among parties having no common judge, \"each party has an\r\nequal right to judge for itself as well of infractions as of the mode\r\nand measure of redress.\" Thus spoke Kentucky in the first years of her\r\nexistence as a sovereign. The great truth announced in her series of\r\nresolutions was the sign under which the Democracy conquered in 1800,\r\nand which constituted the corner-stone of the political edifice of which\r\nJefferson was the architect, and which stood unshaken for sixty years\r\nfrom the time its foundation was laid. During this period, the growth,\r\nprosperity, and happiness of the country seemed unmistakably to confirm\r\nthe wisdom of the voluntary union of free sovereign States under a\r\nwritten compact confining the action of the General Government to the\r\nexpressly enumerated powers which had been delegated therein. When\r\ninfractions of the compact had been deliberately and persistently made,\r\nwhen the intent was clearly manifested to pervert the powers of the\r\nGeneral Government from the purposes for which they had been conferred,\r\nand to use them for the injury of a portion of the States, which were\r\nthe integral parties to the compact, some of them resolved to judge for\r\nthemselves of the \"mode and measure of redress,\" and to exercise the\r\nright, enunciated in the Declaration of Independence to be the\r\nunalienable endowment of every people, to alter or abolish any form of\r\ngovernment, and to institute a new one, \"laying its foundation on such\r\nprinciples, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall\r\nseem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.\" By no rational\r\nmode of construction, in view of the history of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, or of the resolutions of Kentucky, can it be claimed that\r\nthe word \"people\" had any other meaning than that of a distinct\r\ncommunity, such as the people of each colony who by their delegates in\r\nthe Congress declared themselves to be henceforth a State; and that none\r\nother than the people of each State could, by the resolutions of\r\n1798-'99, have been referred to as the final judge of infractions of\r\ntheir compact, and of the remedy which should be applied.\r\n\r\nKentucky made no decision adverse to this right of a State, but she\r\ndeclared, in the impending conflict between the States seceding from and\r\nthose adhering to the Federal Government, that she would hold the\r\nposition of neutrality. If the question was to be settled by a war of\r\nwords, that was feasible; but, if the conflict was to be one of arms, it\r\nwas utterly impracticable. To maintain neutrality under such\r\ncircumstances would have required a power greater than that of both the\r\ncontestants, or a moral influence commanding such respect for her wishes\r\nas could hardly have been anticipated from that party which had, in\r\nviolation of right, inflicted the wrongs which produced the withdrawal\r\nof some of the States, and had uttered multiplied threats of coercion if\r\nany State attempted to exercise the rights defined in the resolutions of\r\n1798-'99. If, however, any such hope may have been entertained, but few\r\nmoons had filled and waned before the defiant occupation of her\r\nterritory and the enrollment of her citizens as soldiers in the army of\r\ninvasion must have dispelled the illusion.\r\n\r\nThe following correspondence took place in August, between Governor\r\nMagoffin, of Kentucky, and President Lincoln--also between the Governor\r\nand myself, as President of the Confederate States--relative to the\r\nneutrality of the State:\r\n\r\n    \"Commonwealth of Kentucky, Executive Department,\r\n\r\n    \"Frankfort, _August 19,1861_.\r\n\r\n    To his Excellency Abraham Lincoln, _President of the United\r\n    States_.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir: From the commencement of the unhappy hostilities now\r\n    pending in this country, the people of Kentucky have indicated\r\n    an earnest desire and purpose, as far as lay in their power,\r\n    while maintaining their original political status, to do nothing\r\n    by which to involve themselves in the war. Up to this time they\r\n    have succeeded in securing to themselves and to the State peace\r\n    and tranquillity as the fruits of the policy they adopted. My\r\n    single object now is to promote the continuance of these\r\n    blessings to this State.\r\n\r\n    \"Until within a brief period the people of Kentucky were quiet\r\n    and tranquil, free from domestic strife, and undisturbed by\r\n    internal commotion. They have resisted no law, rebelled against\r\n    no authority, engaged in no revolution, but constantly\r\n    proclaimed their firm determination to pursue their peaceful\r\n    avocations, earnestly hoping that their own soil would be spared\r\n    the presence of armed troops, and that the scene of conflict\r\n    would be kept removed beyond the border of their State. By thus\r\n    avoiding all occasions for the introduction of bodies of armed\r\n    soldiers, and offering no provocation for the presence of\r\n    military force, the people of Kentucky have sincerely striven to\r\n    preserve in their State domestic peace and avert the calamities\r\n    of sanguinary engagements.\r\n\r\n    \"Recently a large body of soldiers have been enlisted in the\r\n    United States army and collected in military camps in the\r\n    central portion of Kentucky. This movement was preceded by the\r\n    active organization of companies, regiments, etc., consisting of\r\n    men sworn into the United States service, under officers holding\r\n    commissions from yourself. Ordnance, arms, munitions, and\r\n    supplies of war are being transported into the State, and placed\r\n    in large quantities in these camps. In a word, an army is now\r\n    being organized and quartered within the State, supplied with\r\n    all the appliances of war, without the consent or advice of the\r\n    authorities of the State, and without consultation with those\r\n    most prominently known and recognized as loyal citizens. This\r\n    movement now imperils that peace and tranquillity which from the\r\n    beginning of our pending difficulties have been the paramount\r\n    desire of this people, and which, up to this time, they have so\r\n    secured to the State.\r\n\r\n    \"Within Kentucky there has been, and is likely to be, no\r\n    occasion for the presence of military force. The people are\r\n    quiet and tranquil, feeling no apprehension of any occasion\r\n    arising to invoke protection from the Federal arm. They have\r\n    asked that their territory be left free from military\r\n    occupation, and the present tranquillity of their communication\r\n    left uninvaded by soldiers. They do not desire that Kentucky\r\n    shall be required to supply the battle-field for the contending\r\n    armies, or become the theatre of the war.\r\n\r\n    \"Now, therefore, as Governor of the State of Kentucky, and in\r\n    the name of the people I have the honor to represent, and with\r\n    the single and earnest desire to avert from their peaceful homes\r\n    the horrors of war, I urge the removal from the limits of\r\n    Kentucky of the military force now organized and in camp within\r\n    the State. If such action as is here urged be promptly taken, I\r\n    firmly believe the peace of the people of Kentucky will be\r\n    preserved, and the horrors of a bloody war will be averted from\r\n    a people now peaceful and tranquil.\r\n\r\n    \"I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    \"B.

Up to this period they have enjoyed comparative\r\n    tranquillity and entire domestic peace.\r\n\r\n    \"Recently a military force has been enlisted and quartered by\r\n    the United States authorities within this State.

The people of this State desire to be free from the\r\n    presence of the soldiers of either belligerent, and to that end\r\n    my efforts are now directed.\r\n\r\n    \"Although I have no reason to presume that the Government of the\r\n    Confederate States contemplate or have ever proposed any\r\n    violation of the neutral attitude thus assumed by Kentucky,\r\n    there seems to be some uneasiness felt among the people of some\r\n    portion of the State, occasioned by the collection of bodies of\r\n    troops along their southern frontier. In order to quiet this\r\n    apprehension, and to secure to the people their cherished object\r\n    of peace, this communication is to present these facts and\r\n    elicit an authoritative assurance that the Government of the\r\n    Confederate States will continue to respect and observe the\r\n    position indicated as assumed by Kentucky.\r\n\r\n    \"Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    \"B.

The assemblage of\r\n    troops in Tennessee, to which you refer, had no other object\r\n    than to repel the lawless invasion of that State by the forces\r\n    of the United States, should their Government seek to approach\r\n    it through Kentucky, without respect for its position of\r\n    neutrality. That such apprehensions were not groundless has been\r\n    proved by the course of that Government in the States of\r\n    Maryland and Missouri, and more recently in Kentucky itself, in\r\n    which, as you inform me, 'a military force has been enlisted and\r\n    quartered by the United States authorities.'\r\n\r\n    \"The Government of the Confederate States has not only respected\r\n    most scrupulously the neutrality of Kentucky, but has continued\r\n    to maintain the friendly relations of trade and intercourse\r\n    which it has suspended with the United States generally.\r\n\r\n    \"In view of the history of the past, it can scarcely be\r\n    necessary to assure your Excellency that the Government of the\r\n    Confederate States will continue to respect the neutrality of\r\n    Kentucky so long as her people will maintain it themselves.\r\n\r\n    \"But neutrality, to be entitled to respect, must be strictly\r\n    maintained between both parties; or, if the door be opened on\r\n    the one side for the aggressions of one of the belligerent\r\n    parties upon the other, it ought not to be shut to the assailed\r\n    when they seek to enter it for purposes of self-defense.\r\n\r\n    \"I do not, however, for a moment believe that your gallant State\r\n    will suffer its soil to be used for the purpose of giving an\r\n    advantage to those who violate its neutrality and disregard its\r\n    rights, over others who respect both.\r\n\r\n    \"In conclusion, I tender to your Excellency the assurance of my\r\n    high consideration and regard, and am, sir, very respectfully,\r\n\r\n    \"Yours, etc., Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\nMovements by the Federal forces in southwestern Kentucky revealed such\r\ndesigns as made it absolutely necessary that General Polk, commanding\r\nthe Confederate forces in that section, should immediately occupy the\r\ntown of Columbus, Kentucky; a position of much strategic importance on\r\nthe shore of the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nThat position was doubly important, because it commanded the opposite\r\nshore in Missouri, and was the gateway on the border of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nTwo States of the Confederacy were therefore threatened by the\r\nanticipated movement of the enemy to get possession of Columbus.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Polk, therefore, crossed the State line, took possession\r\nof Hickman on September 3d, and on the 4th secured Columbus. General\r\nGrant, who took command at Cairo on September 2d, being thus\r\nanticipated, seized Paducah, at the mouth of the Tennessee River, and\r\noccupied it in force on the 5th and 6th.\r\n\r\nAfter the occupation, under date of September 4th, I received the\r\nfollowing dispatch from Major-General Polk: \"The enemy having descended\r\nthe Mississippi River some three or four days since, and seated himself\r\nwith cannon and entrenched lines opposite the town of Columbus,\r\nKentucky, making such demonstrations as left no doubt upon the minds of\r\nany of their intention to seize and forcibly possess said town, I\r\nthought proper, under the plenary power delegated to me, to direct a\r\nsufficient portion of my command both by the river way and land to\r\nconcentrate at Columbus, as well to offer to its citizens that\r\nprotection they unite to a man in accepting, as also to prevent, in\r\ntime, the occupation by the enemy of a point so necessary to the\r\nsecurity of western Tennessee. The demonstration on my part has had the\r\ndesired effect. The enemy has withdrawn his forces even before I had\r\nfortified my position. It is my intention to continue to occupy and hold\r\nthis place.\" On the same day I sent the following reply to Major-General\r\nPolk: \"Your telegram received; the necessity must justify the action.\"\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of Kentucky passed resolutions and appointed a committee\r\nto inquire into the action of General Polk, from which the annexed\r\ncorrespondence resulted:\r\n\r\n    CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN MAJOR-GENERAL POLK AND THE AUTHORITIES OF\r\n    KENTUCKY.\r\n\r\n    _Resolutions of the Kentucky Senate relative to the Violation of\r\n    the Neutrality of Kentucky._\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved by the Senate_, That the special committee of the\r\n    Senate, raised for the purpose of considering the reported\r\n    occupation of Hickman and other points in Kentucky by\r\n    Confederate troops, take into consideration the occupation of\r\n    Paducah and other places in Kentucky by the Federal authorities,\r\n    and report thereon when the true state of the case shall have\r\n    been ascertained.

The cases alluded to by his\r\n    Excellency, Governor Magoffin, in his recent message, as\r\n    'raids,' I presume, are the cases of the steamers Cheney and\r\n    Orr. The former was the unauthorized and unrecognized act of\r\n    certain citizens of Alabama, and the latter the act of citizens\r\n    of Tennessee and others, and was an act of reprisal. They can\r\n    not, therefore, be charged, in any sense, as acts of the\r\n    Confederate Government.\r\n\r\n    \"The first and only instance in which the neutrality of Kentucky\r\n    has been disregarded is that in which the troops under my\r\n    command, and by my direction, took possession of the place I now\r\n    hold, and so much of the territory between it and the Tennessee\r\n    line as was necessary for me to pass over in order to reach it.\r\n    This act finds abundant justification in the history of the\r\n    concessions granted to the Federal Government by Kentucky ever\r\n    since the war began, notwithstanding the position of neutrality\r\n    which she had assumed, and the firmness with which she\r\n    proclaimed her intention to maintain it. That history shows the\r\n    following among other facts: In January, the House of\r\n    Representatives of Kentucky passed anti-coercion\r\n    resolutions--only four dissenting. The Governor, in May, issued\r\n    his neutrality proclamation. The address of the Union Central\r\n    Committee, including Mr. James Speed, Mr. Prentice, and other\r\n    prominent Union men, in April, proclaimed neutrality as the\r\n    policy of Kentucky, and claimed that an attempt to coerce the\r\n    South should induce Kentucky to make common cause with her, and\r\n    take part in the contest on her side, 'without counting the\r\n    cost.' The Union speakers and papers, with few exceptions,\r\n    claimed, up to the last election, that the Union vote was strict\r\n    neutrality and peace. These facts and events gave assurance of\r\n    the integrity of the avowed purpose of your State, and we were\r\n    content with the position she assumed.\r\n\r\n    \"Since the election, however, she has allowed the seizure in her\r\n    port (Paducah) of property of citizens of the Confederate\r\n    States; she has, by her members in the Congress of the United\r\n    States, voted supplies of men and money to carry on the war\r\n    against the Confederate States; she has allowed the Federal\r\n    Government to cut timber from her forests for the purpose of\r\n    building armed boats for the invasion of the Southern States;\r\n    she is permitting to be enlisted in her territory, troops, not\r\n    only of her own citizens, but of the citizens of other States,\r\n    for the purpose of being armed and used in offensive warfare\r\n    against the Confederate States. At Camp Robinson, in the county\r\n    of Garrard, there are now ten thousand troops, if the newspapers\r\n    can be relied upon, in which men from Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana,\r\n    and Illinois are mustered with Kentuckians into the service of\r\n    the United States, and armed by that Government for the avowed\r\n    purpose of giving aid to the disaffected in one of the\r\n    Confederate States, and of carrying out the designs of that\r\n    Government for their subjugation. Notwithstanding all these and\r\n    other acts of a similar character, the Confederate States have\r\n    continued to respect the attitude which Kentucky had assumed as\r\n    a neutral, and forborne from reprisals, in the hope that\r\n    Kentucky would yet enforce respect for her position on the part\r\n    of the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\n    \"Our patient expectation has been disappointed, and it was only\r\n    when we perceived that this continued indifference to our rights\r\n    and our safety was about to culminate in the seizure of an\r\n    important part of her territory by the United States forces for\r\n    offensive operations against the Confederate States, that a\r\n    regard for self-preservation demanded of us to seize it in\r\n    advance. We are here, therefore, not by choice, but of\r\n    necessity, and as I have had the honor to say, in a\r\n    communication addressed to his Excellency Governor Magoffin, a\r\n    copy of which is herewith inclosed and submitted as a part of my\r\n    reply, so I now repeat in answer to your request, that I am\r\n    prepared to agree to withdraw the Confederate troops from\r\n    Kentucky, provided she will agree that the troops of the Federal\r\n    Government be withdrawn simultaneously, with a guarantee (which\r\n    I will give reciprocally for the Confederate Government) that\r\n    the Federal troops shall not be allowed to enter nor occupy any\r\n    part of Kentucky for the future.\r\n\r\n    \"In view of the facts thus submitted, I can not but think the\r\n    world at large will find it difficult to appreciate the\r\n    'profound astonishment' with which you say the people of\r\n    Kentucky received the intelligence of the occupation of this\r\n    place.\r\n\r\n    \"I have the honor to be, respectfully,\r\n\r\n    \"Your obedient servant, etc.,\r\n\r\n    \"Leonidas Polk,\r\n\r\n    \"_Major-General commanding_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Letter from General Polk to Governor Magoffin._\r\n\r\n    \"Columbus, Kentucky, _September 3, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"Governor Magoffin, _Frankfort, Kentucky_.\r\n\r\n    \"I should have dispatched to you immediately, as the troops\r\n    under my command took possession of this position, the very few\r\n    words I addressed to the people here; but my duties since that\r\n    time have so preoccupied me, that I have but now the first\r\n    leisure moment to communicate with you. It will be sufficient\r\n    for me to inform you (as my short address herewith will do) that\r\n    I had information, on which I could rely, that the Federal\r\n    forces intended, and were preparing to seize Columbus. I need\r\n    not describe to you the danger resulting to western Tennessee\r\n    from such occupation.\r\n\r\n    \"My responsibility could not permit me quietly to lose to the\r\n    command intrusted to me so important a position. In evidence of\r\n    the accuracy of the information I possessed, I will state that,\r\n    as the Confederate force approached this place, the Federal\r\n    troops were found in formidable numbers in position upon the\r\n    opposite bank, with their cannon turned upon Columbus. The\r\n    citizens of the town had fled with terror, and not a word of\r\n    assurance of safety or protection had been addressed to them.\r\n    Since I have taken possession of this place, I have been\r\n    informed by highly respected citizens of your State that certain\r\n    representatives of the Federal Government are seeking to take\r\n    advantage of its own wrong, are setting up complaints against my\r\n    acts of occupation, and are making it a pretest for seizing\r\n    other points. Upon this proceeding I have no comments to make.\r\n    But I am prepared to say that I will agree to withdraw the\r\n    Confederate troops from Kentucky, provided that she will agree\r\n    that the troops of the Federal Government be withdrawn\r\n    simultaneously, with a guarantee (which I will give reciprocally\r\n    for the Confederate Government) that the Federal troops shall\r\n    not be allowed to enter or occupy any part of Kentucky in the\r\n    future.\r\n\r\n    \"I have the honor to be, respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    (Signed)\r\n\r\n    \"Leonidas Polk,\r\n\r\n    \"_Major-General commanding_.\"\r\n\r\nHowever willing the government of Kentucky might have been to accede to\r\nthe proposition of General Polk, and which from his knowledge of the\r\nviews of his own Government he was fully justified in offering, the\r\nState of Kentucky had no power, moral or physical, to prevent the United\r\nStates Government from using her soil as best might suit its purposes in\r\nthe war it was waging for the subjugation of the seceded States.\r\nPresident Lincoln, in his message of the previous July, had distinctly\r\nand reproachfully spoken of the idea of neutrality as existing in some\r\nof the border States. He said: \"To prevent the Union forces passing one\r\nway, or the disunion the other, over their soil, would be disunion\r\ncompleted.... At a stroke it would take all the trouble off the hands of\r\nsecession, except only what proceeds from the external blockade.\"\r\n\r\nThe acts of the Federal Government corresponded with the views announced\r\nby its President. Briefly, but conclusively, General Polk showed in his\r\nanswer that the United States Government paid no respect to the neutral\r\nposition which Kentucky wished to maintain; that it was armed, but not\r\nneutral, for the arms and the troops assembled on her soil were for the\r\ninvasion of the South; and that he occupied Columbus to prevent the\r\nenemy from taking possession of it. When our troops first entered\r\nColumbus they found the inhabitants had been in alarm from\r\ndemonstrations of the United States forces, but that they felt no dread\r\nof the Confederate troops. As far as the truth could be ascertained, a\r\ndecided majority of the people of Kentucky, especially its southwestern\r\nportion, if left to a free choice, would have joined the Confederacy in\r\npreference to remaining in the Union. Could they have foreseen what in a\r\nshort time was revealed, there can be little doubt that mule contracts,\r\nand other forms of bribery, would have proved unavailing to make her the\r\npassive observer of usurpations destructive of the personal and\r\npolitical rights of which she had always been a most earnest advocate.\r\nWith the slow and sinuous approach of the serpent, the General\r\nGovernment, little by little, gained power over Kentucky, and then,\r\nthrowing off the mask, proceeded to outrages so regardless of law and\r\nthe usages of English-speaking people, as could not have been\r\nanticipated, and can only be remembered with shame by those who honor\r\nthe constitutional Government created by the States. While artfully\r\nurging the maintenance of the Union as a duty of patriotism, the\r\nConstitution which gave the Union birth was trampled under foot, and the\r\nexcesses of the Reign of Terror which followed the French Revolution\r\nwere reënacted in our land, once the vaunted home of law and liberty.\r\nMen who had been most honored by the State, and who had reflected back\r\nmost honor upon it, were seized without warrant, condemned without\r\ntrial, because they had exercised the privilege of free speech, and for\r\nadhering to the principles which were the bed-rock on which our fathers\r\nbuilded our political temple. Members of the Legislature vacated their\r\nseats and left the State to avoid arrest, the penalty hanging over them\r\nfor opinion's sake. The venerable Judge Monroe, who had presided over\r\nthe United States District Court for more than a generation, driven from\r\nthe land of his birth, the State he had served so long and so well, with\r\nfeeble step, but upright conscience and indomitable will, sought a\r\nresting place among those who did not regard it a crime to adhere to the\r\nprinciples of 1776 and of 1787, and the declaratory affirmation of them\r\nin the resolutions of 1793-'99. About the same time others of great\r\nworth and distinction, impelled by the feeling that \"where liberty is\r\nthere is my country,\" left the land desecrated by despotic usurpation,\r\nto join the Confederacy in its struggle to maintain the personal and\r\npolitical liberties which the men of the Revolution had left as an\r\ninheritance to their posterity. Space would not suffice for a complete\r\nlist of the refugees who became conspicuous in the military events of\r\nthe Confederacy; let a few answer for the many: J. C. Breckinridge, the\r\nlate Vice-President of the United States, and whose general and\r\nwell-deserved popularity might have reasonably led him to expect in the\r\nUnion the highest honors the States could bestow; William Preston,\r\nGeorge W. Johnston, S. B. Buckner, John H. Morgan, and a host of others,\r\nalike meritorious and alike gratefully remembered. When the passions of\r\nthe hour shall have subsided, and the past shall be reviewed with\r\ndiscrimination and justice, the question must arise in every reflecting\r\nmind, Why did such men as these expatriate themselves, and surrender all\r\nthe advantages which they had won by a life of honorable effort in the\r\nland of their nativity? To such inquiry the answer must be, the\r\nusurpations of the General Government foretold to them the wreck of\r\nconstitutional liberty. The motives which governed them may best be\r\nlearned from the annexed extracts from the statement made in the address\r\nof Mr. Breckinridge to the people of Kentucky, whom he had represented\r\nin both Houses of the United States Congress, with such distinguished\r\nability and zeal for the general welfare as to place him in the front\r\nrank of the statesmen of his day:\r\n\r\n    \"Bowling Green, Kentucky, _October 8,1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"In obedience, as I supposed, to your wishes, I proceeded to\r\n    Washington, and at the special session of Congress, in July,\r\n    spoke and voted against the whole war policy of the President\r\n    and Congress; demanding, in addition, for Kentucky, the right to\r\n    refuse, not men only, but money also, to the war, for I would\r\n    have blushed to meet you with the confession that I had\r\n    purchased for you exemption from the perils of the battle-field,\r\n    and the shame of waging war against your Southern brethren, by\r\n    hiring others to do the work you shrunk from performing. During\r\n    that memorable session a very small body of Senators and\r\n    Representatives, even beneath the shadow of a military\r\n    despotism, resisted the usurpations of the Executive, and, with\r\n    what degree of dignity and firmness, they willingly submit to\r\n    the judgment of the world.\r\n\r\n    \"Their efforts were unavailing, yet they may prove valuable\r\n    hereafter, as another added to former examples of many protest\r\n    against the progress of tyranny.\r\n\r\n    \"On my return to Kentucky, at the close of the late special\r\n    session of Congress, it was my purpose immediately to resign the\r\n    office of Senator. The verbal and written remonstrances of many\r\n    friends in different parts of the State induced me to postpone\r\n    the execution of my purpose; but the time has arrived to carry\r\n    it into effect, and accordingly I now hereby return the trust\r\n    into your hands.... In the House of Representatives it was\r\n    declared that the South should be reduced to 'abject\r\n    submission,' or their institutions be overthrown. In the Senate\r\n    it was said that, if necessary, the South should be depopulated\r\n    and repeopled from the North; and an eminent Senator expressed a\r\n    desire that the President should be made dictator. This was\r\n    superfluous, since they had already clothed him with dictatorial\r\n    powers. In the midst of these proceedings, no plea for the\r\n    Constitution is listened to in the North; here and there a few\r\n    heroic voices are feebly heard protesting against the progress\r\n    of despotism, but, for the most part, beyond the military lines,\r\n    mobs and anarchy rule the hour.\r\n\r\n    \"The great mass of the Northern people seem anxious to sunder\r\n    every safeguard of freedom; they eagerly offer to the Government\r\n    what no European monarch would dare to demand. The President and\r\n    his generals are unable to pick up the liberties of the people\r\n    as rapidly as they are thrown at their feet.... In every form by\r\n    which you could give direct expression to your will, you\r\n    declared for neutrality. A large majority of the people at the\r\n    May and August elections voted for the neutrality and peace of\r\n    Kentucky. The press, the public speakers, the candidates--with\r\n    exceptions in favor of the Government at Washington so rare as\r\n    not to need mention--planted themselves on this position. You\r\n    voted for it, and you meant it. You were promised it, and you\r\n    expected it.... Look now at the condition of Kentucky, and see\r\n    how your expectations have been realized--how these promises\r\n    have been redeemed.... General Anderson, the military dictator\r\n    of Kentucky, announces in one of his proclamations that he will\r\n    arrest no one who does not act, write, or speak in opposition to\r\n    Mr. Lincoln's Government. It would have completed the idea if he\r\n    had added, or think in opposition to it. Look at the condition\r\n    of our State under the rule of our new protectors. They have\r\n    suppressed the freedom of speech and of the press. They seize\r\n    people by military force upon mere suspicion, and impose on them\r\n    oaths unknown to the laws. Other citizens they imprison without\r\n    warrant, and carry them out of the State, so that the writ of\r\n    _habeas corpus_ can not reach them.\r\n\r\n    \"Every day foreign armed bands are making seizures among the\r\n    people. Hundreds of citizens, old and young, venerable\r\n    magistrates, whose lives have been distinguished by the love of\r\n    the people, have been compelled to fly from their homes and\r\n    families to escape imprisonment and exile at the hands of\r\n    Northern and German soldiers, under the orders of Mr. Lincoln\r\n    and his military subordinates. While yet holding an important\r\n    political trust, confided by Kentucky, I was compelled to leave\r\n    my home and family, or suffer imprisonment and exile. If it is\r\n    asked why I did not meet the arrest and seek a trial, my answer\r\n    is, that I would have welcomed an arrest to be followed by a\r\n    judge and jury; but you well know that I could not have secured\r\n    these constitutional rights. I would have been transported\r\n    beyond the State, to languish in some Federal fortress during\r\n    the pleasure of the oppressor. Witness the fate of Morehead and\r\n    his Kentucky associates in their distant and gloomy prison.\r\n\r\n    \"The case of the gentleman just mentioned is an example of many\r\n    others, and it meets every element in a definition of despotism.\r\n    If it should occur in England it would be righted, or it would\r\n    overturn the British Empire. He is a citizen and native of\r\n    Kentucky. As a member of the Legislature, Speaker of the House,\r\n    Representative in Congress from the Ashland district, and\r\n    Governor of the State, you have known, trusted, and honored him\r\n    during a public service of a quarter of a century. He is eminent\r\n    for his ability, his amiable character, and his blameless life.\r\n    Yet this man, without indictment, without warrant, without\r\n    accusation, but by the order of President Lincoln, was seized at\r\n    midnight, in his own house, and in the midst of his own family,\r\n    and led through the streets of Louisville, as I am informed,\r\n    with his hands crossed and pinioned before him--was carried out\r\n    of the State and district, and now lies a prisoner in a fortress\r\n    in New York Harbor, a thousand miles away....\r\n\r\n    \"The Constitution of the United States, which these invaders\r\n    unconstitutionally swear every citizen whom they\r\n    unconstitutionally seize to support, has been wholly abolished.\r\n    It is as much forgotten as if it lay away back in the twilight\r\n    of history. The facts I have enumerated show that the very\r\n    rights most carefully reserved by it to the States and to\r\n    individuals have been most conspicuously violated.... Your\r\n    fellow-citizen,\r\n\r\n    (Signed)  \"John C. Breckinridge.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the \"neutrality\" suffered by the Confederacy from governments\r\nboth at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nThe chivalric people of Kentucky showed their sympathy with the just\r\ncause of the people of the Southern States, by leaving the home where\r\nthey could not serve the cause of right against might, and nobly shared\r\nthe fortunes of their Southern brethren on many a blood-dyed field. In\r\nlike manner did the British people see with disapprobation their\r\nGovernment, while proclaiming neutrality, make new rules, and give new\r\nconstructions to old ones, so as to favor our enemy and embarrass us.\r\nThe Englishman's sense of fair-play, and the manly instinct which\r\npredisposes him to side with the weak, gave us hosts of friends, but all\r\ntheir good intentions were paralyzed or foiled by their wily Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, and his coadjutor on this side, the artful,\r\nunscrupulous United States Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nI have thus presented the case of Kentucky, not because it was the only\r\nState where false promises lulled the people into delusive security,\r\nuntil, by gradual approaches, usurpation had bound them hand and foot,\r\nand where despotic power crushed all the muniments of civil liberty\r\nwhich the Union was formed to secure, but because of the attempt, which\r\nhas been noticed, to arraign the Confederacy for invasion of the State\r\nin disregard of her sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of Columbus by the Confederate forces was only just soon\r\nenough to anticipate the predetermined purpose of the Federal\r\nGovernment, all of which was plainly set forth in the letter of General\r\nPolk to the Governor of Kentucky, and his subsequent letter to the\r\nKentucky commissioners.\r\n\r\nMissouri, like Kentucky, had wished to preserve peaceful relations in\r\nthe contest which it was foreseen would soon occur between the Northern\r\nand the Southern States. When the Federal Government denied to her the\r\nprivilege of choosing her own position, which betokened no hostility to\r\nthe General Government, and she was driven to the necessity of deciding\r\nwhether or not her citizens should be used for the subjugation of the\r\nSouthern States, her people and their representative, the State\r\ngovernment, repelled the arbitrary assumption of authority by military\r\nforce to control her government and her people.\r\n\r\nAmong other acts of invasion, the Federal troops had occupied Belmont, a\r\nvillage in Missouri opposite to Columbus, and with artillery threatened\r\nthat town, inspiring terror in its peaceful inhabitants. After the\r\noccupation of Columbus, under these circumstances of full justification,\r\na small Confederate force, Colonel Tappan's Arkansas regiment, and\r\nBeltzhoover's battery, were thrown across the Mississippi to occupy and\r\nhold the village, in the State of Missouri, then an ally, and soon to\r\nbecome a member, of the Confederacy. On the 6th of November General\r\nGrant left his headquarters at Cairo with a land and naval force, and\r\nencamped on the Kentucky shore. This act and a demonstration made by\r\ndetachments from his force at Paducah were probably intended to induce\r\nthe belief that he contemplated an attack on Columbus, thus concealing\r\nhis real purpose to surprise the small garrison at Belmont. General Polk\r\non the morning of the 7th discovered the landing of the Federal forces\r\non the Missouri shore, some seven miles above Columbus, and, divining\r\nthe real purpose of the enemy, detached General Pillow with four\r\nregiments of his division, say two thousand men, to reënforce the\r\ngarrison at Belmont. Very soon after his arrival, the enemy commenced an\r\nassault which was sternly resisted, and with varying fortune, for\r\nseveral hours. The enemy's front so far exceeded the length of our line\r\nas to enable him to attack on both flanks, and our troops were finally\r\ndriven back to the bank of the river with the loss of their battery,\r\nwhich had been gallantly and efficiently served until nearly all its\r\nhorses had been killed, and its ammunition had been expended. The enemy\r\nadvanced to the bank of the river below the point to which our men had\r\nretreated, and opened an artillery-fire upon the town of Columbus, to\r\nwhich our guns from the commanding height responded with such effect as\r\nto drive him from the river bank. In the mean time General Polk had at\r\nintervals sent three regiments to reënforce General Pillow. Upon the\r\narrival of the first of these, General Pillow led it to a favorable\r\nposition, where it for some time steadily resisted and checked the\r\nadvance of the enemy. General Pillow, with great energy and gallantry,\r\nrallied his repulsed troops and brought them again into action. General\r\nPolk now proceeded in person with two other regiments. Whether from this\r\nor some other cause, the enemy commenced a retreat. General Pillow,\r\nwhose activity and daring on the occasion were worthy of all praise, led\r\nthe first and second detachments, by which he had been reënforced, to\r\nattack the enemy in the rear, and General Polk, landing further up the\r\nriver, moved to cut off the enemy's retreat; but some embarrassment and\r\nconsequent delay which occurred in landing his troops caused him to be\r\ntoo late for the purpose for which he crossed, and to become only a part\r\nof the pursuing force.\r\n\r\nOne would naturally suppose that the question about which there would be\r\nthe greatest certainty would be the number of troops engaged in a\r\nbattle, yet there is nothing in regard to which we have such conflicting\r\naccounts. It is fairly concluded, from the concurrent reports, that the\r\nenemy attacked us on both flanks, and that in the beginning of the\r\naction we were outnumbered; but the obstinacy with which the conflict\r\nwas maintained and the successive advances and retreats which occurred\r\nin the action indicate that the disparity could not have been very\r\ngreat, and therefore that, after the arrival of our reënforcements, our\r\ntroops must have become numerically superior. The dead and wounded left\r\nby the enemy upon the field, the arms, ammunition, and military stores\r\nabandoned in his flight, so incontestably prove his defeat, that his\r\nclaim to have achieved a victory is too preposterous for discussion.\r\nThough the forces engaged were comparatively small to those in\r\nsubsequent battles of the war, six hours of incessant combat, with\r\nrepeated bayonet-charges, must place this in the rank of the most\r\nstubborn engagements, and the victors must accord to the vanquished the\r\nmeed of having fought like Americans. One of the results of the battle,\r\nwhich is at least significant, is the fact that General Grant, who had\r\nsuperciliously refused to recognize General Polk as one with whom he\r\ncould exchange prisoners, did, after the battle, send a flag of truce to\r\nget such privileges as are recognized between armies acknowledging each\r\nother to be \"foemen worthy of their steel.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Polk reported as follows: \"We pursued them to their boats, seven\r\nmiles, and then drove their boats before us. The road was strewed with\r\ntheir dead and wounded, guns, ammunition, and equipments. The number of\r\nprisoners taken by the enemy, as shown by their list furnished, was one\r\nhundred and six, all of whom have been returned by exchange. After\r\nmaking a liberal allowance to the enemy, a hundred of their prisoners\r\nstill remain in my hands, one stand of colors, and a fraction over one\r\nthousand stand of arms, with knapsacks, ammunition, and other military\r\nstores. Our loss in killed, wounded, and missing, was six hundred and\r\nforty one; that of the enemy was probably not less than twelve hundred.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Albert Sidney Johnston, a soldier of great distinction in the\r\nUnited States Army, where he had attained the rank of brigadier-general\r\nby brevet, and was in command of the Department of California, resigned\r\nhis commission, and came overland from San Francisco to Richmond, to\r\ntender his services to the Confederate States. Though he had been bred a\r\nsoldier, and most of his life had been spent in the army, he had not\r\nneglected such study of political affairs as properly belongs to the\r\ncitizen of a republic, and appreciated the issue made between States\r\nclaiming the right to resume the powers they had delegated to a general\r\nagent and the claims set up by that agent to coerce States, his\r\ncreators, and for whom he held a trust.\r\n\r\nHe was a native of Kentucky, but his first military appointment was from\r\nLouisiana, and he was a volunteer in the war for independence by Texas,\r\nand for a time resided in that State. Much of his military service had\r\nbeen in the West, and he felt most identified with it. On the 10th of\r\nSeptember, 1861, he was assigned to command our Department of the West,\r\nwhich included the States of Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas, the Indian\r\ncountry, and the western part of Mississippi.\r\n\r\nGeneral Johnston, on his arrival at Nashville, found that he lacked not\r\nonly men, but the munitions of war and the means of obtaining them. Men\r\nwere ready to be enlisted, but the arms and equipments had nearly all\r\nbeen required to fit out the first levies. Immediately on his survey of\r\nthe situation, he determined to occupy Bowling Green in Kentucky, and\r\nordered Brigadier-General S. B. Buckner, with five thousand men, to take\r\npossession of the position. This invasion of Kentucky was an act of\r\nself-defense rendered necessary by the action of the government of\r\nKentucky, and by the evidences of intended movements of the forces of\r\nthe United States. It was not possible to withdraw the troops from\r\nColumbus in the west, nor from Cumberland Ford in the east, to which\r\nGeneral Felix K. Zollicoffer had advanced with four thousand men. A\r\ncompliance with the demands of Kentucky would have opened the frontiers\r\nof Tennessee and the Mississippi River to the enemy; besides, it was\r\nessential to the defense of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nEast of Columbus, Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, and Hopkinsville were\r\ngarrisoned with small bodies of troops; and the territory between\r\nColumbus and Bowling Green was occupied by moving detachments which\r\ncaused the supposition that a large military force was present and\r\ncontemplated an advance. A fortified camp was established at Cumberland\r\nGap as the right of General Johnston's line, and an important point for\r\nthe protection of East Tennessee against invasion. Thus General Johnston\r\nlocated his line of defense, from Columbus on the west to the Cumberland\r\nMountains on the east, with his center at Bowling Green, which was\r\noccupied and intrenched. It was a good base for military operations, was\r\na proper depot for supplies, and, if fortified, could be held against\r\nlargely superior numbers.\r\n\r\nOn October 28th General Johnston took command at Bowling Green. He\r\nstates his force to have been twelve thousand men, and that the enemy's\r\nforce at that time was estimated to be double his own, or twenty-four\r\nthousand. He says: \"The enemy's force increased more rapidly than our\r\nown, so that by the last of November it numbered fifty thousand, and\r\ncontinued to increase until it ran up to between seventy-five and one\r\nhundred thousand. My force was kept down by disease, so that it numbered\r\nabout twenty-two thousand.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief anxiety of the commander of the department was to procure arms\r\nand men. On the next day after his arrival at Nashville, he wrote to the\r\nGovernor of Alabama, \"I shall beg to rely on your Excellency to furnish\r\nus as rapidly as possible, at this point, with every arm it may be in\r\nyour power to provide--I mean small-arms for infantry and cavalry.\" The\r\nGovernor replied, \"It is out of the power of Alabama to afford you any\r\nassistance in the way of arms.\" The Governor of Georgia replied to the\r\nsame request on September 18th, \"It is utterly impossible for me to\r\ncomply with your request.\" General Bragg, in command at Pensacola,\r\nwrites in reply on September 27th: \"The mission of Colonel Buckner will\r\nnot be successful, I fear, as our extreme Southern country has been\r\nstripped of both arms and men. We started early in this matter, and have\r\nwellnigh exhausted our resources.\" On September 19th General Johnston\r\ntelegraphed to me: \"Thirty thousand stand of arms are a necessity to my\r\ncommand. I beg you to order them, or as many as can be got, to be\r\ninstantly procured and sent with dispatch.\" The Secretary of War\r\nreplied: \"The whole number received by us, by that steamer, was eighteen\r\nhundred, and we purchased of the owners seventeen hundred and eighty,\r\nmaking in all thirty-five hundred Enfield rifles, of which we have been\r\ncompelled to allow the Governor of Georgia to have one thousand for\r\narming troops to repel an attack now hourly threatened at Brunswick. Of\r\nthe remaining twenty-five hundred, I have ordered one thousand sent to\r\nyou, leaving us but fifteen hundred for arming several regiments now\r\nencamped here, and who have been awaiting their arms for several\r\nmonths.... We have not an engineer to send you. The whole engineer corps\r\ncomprises only six captains together with three majors, of whom one is\r\non bureau duty. You will be compelled to employ the best material within\r\nyour reach, by detailing officers from other corps, and by employing\r\ncivil engineers.\"\r\n\r\nThese details are given to serve as an illustration of the deficiencies\r\nexisting in every department of the military service in the first years\r\nof the war. In this respect much relief came from the well-directed\r\nefforts of Governor Harris and the Legislature of Tennessee. A\r\ncap-factory, ordnance-shops, and workshops were established. The\r\npowder-mills at Nashville turned out about four-hundred pounds a day.\r\nTwelve or fourteen batteries were fitted out at Memphis. Laws were\r\npassed to impress and pay for the private arms scattered throughout the\r\nState, and the utmost efforts were made to collect and adapt them to\r\nmilitary uses. The returns make it evident that, during most of the\r\nautumn of 1861, fully one half of General Johnston's troops were\r\nimperfectly armed, and whole brigades remained without weapons for\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nNo less energetic were the measures taken to concentrate and recruit his\r\nforces. General Hardee's command was moved from northeastern Arkansas,\r\nand sent to Bowling Green, which added four thousand men to the troops\r\nthere. The regiment of Texan rangers was brought from Louisiana, and\r\nsupplied with horses and sent to the front. Five hundred Kentuckians\r\njoined General Buckner on his advance, and five regiments were gradually\r\nformed and filled up. A cavalry company under John H. Morgan was also\r\nadded. At this time (September, 1861), General Johnston, under the\r\nauthority granted to him by the Government, made a requisition for\r\nthirty thousand men from Tennessee, ten thousand from Mississippi, and\r\nten thousand from Arkansas. The Arkansas troops were directed to be sent\r\nto General McCulloch for the defense of their own frontier. The Governor\r\nof Mississippi sent four regiments, when this source of supply was\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nUp to the middle of November only three regiments were mustered in under\r\nthis call from Tennessee, but, by the close of December, the number of\r\nmen who joined was from twelve to fifteen thousand. Two regiments,\r\nfifteen hundred strong, had joined General Polk.\r\n\r\nIn Arkansas, five companies and a battalion had been organized, and were\r\nready to join General McCulloch.\r\n\r\nA speedy advance of the enemy was now indicated, and an increase of\r\nforce was so necessary that further delay was impossible. General\r\nJohnston, therefore, determined upon a levy _en masse_ in his\r\ndepartment. He made a requisition on the Governors of Tennessee,\r\nAlabama, and Mississippi, to call out every able-bodied member of the\r\nmilitia into whose hands arms could be placed, or to provide a volunteer\r\nforce large enough to use all the arms that could be procured. In his\r\nletters to these Governors, he plainly presents his view of the posture\r\nof affairs on December 24th, points out impending dangers, and shows\r\nthat to his applications the response had not been such as the emergency\r\ndemanded. He says:\r\n\r\n    \"It was apprehended by me that the enemy would attempt to assail\r\n    the South, not only by boats and troops moving down the river,\r\n    to be assembled during the fall and winter, but by columns\r\n    marching inland, threatening Tennessee, by endeavoring to turn\r\n    the defenses of Columbus. Further observation confirms me in\r\n    this opinion; but I think the means employed for the defense of\r\n    the river will probably render it comparatively secure. The\r\n    enemy will energetically push toward Nashville the heavy masses\r\n    of troops now assembled between Louisville and Bowling Green.\r\n    The general position of Bowling Green is good and commanding;\r\n    but the peculiar topography of the place and the length of the\r\n    line of the Barren River as a line of defense, though strong,\r\n    require a large force to defend it. There is no position equally\r\n    defensive as Bowling Green, nor line of defense as good as the\r\n    Barren River, between the Barren and the Cumberland at\r\n    Nashville; so that it can not be abandoned without exposing\r\n    Tennessee, and giving vastly the vantage-ground to the enemy. It\r\n    is manifest that the Northern generals appreciate this; and, by\r\n    withdrawing their forces from western Virginia and east\r\n    Kentucky, they have managed to add them to the new levies from\r\n    Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and to concentrate a force in front\r\n    of me variously estimated at from sixty to one hundred thousand\r\n    men, and which I believe will number seventy-five thousand. To\r\n    maintain my position, I have only about seventeen thousand men\r\n    in this neighborhood. It is impossible for me to obtain\r\n    additions to my strength from Columbus; the generals in command\r\n    in that quarter consider that it would imperil that point to\r\n    diminish their force, and open Tennessee to the enemy. General\r\n    Zollicoffer can not join me, as he guards the Cumberland, and\r\n    prevents the invasion and possible revolt of East Tennessee.\"\r\n\r\nOn June 5th General Johnston was reënforced by the brigades of Floyd and\r\nManey from western Virginia. He also sent a messenger to Richmond to ask\r\nthat a few regiments might be detached from the several armies in the\r\nfield, and sent to him to be replaced by new levies. He said: \"I do not\r\nask that my force shall be made equal to that of the enemy; but, if\r\npossible, it should be raised to fifty thousand men.\" Meantime such an\r\nappearance of menace had been maintained as led the enemy to believe\r\nthat our force was large, and that he might be attacked at any time.\r\nFrequent and rapid expeditions through the sparsely settled country gave\r\nrise to rumors which kept alive this apprehension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n    The Coercion of Missouri.--Answers of the Governors of States to\r\n    President Lincoln's Requisition for Troops.--Restoration of\r\n    Forts Caswell and Johnson to the United States Government.--\r\n    Condition of Missouri similar to that of Kentucky.--\r\n    Hostilities, how initiated in Missouri.--Agreement between\r\n    Generals Price and Harney.--Its Favorable Effects.--General\r\n    Harney relieved of Command by the United States Government\r\n    because of his Pacific Policy.--Removal of Public Arms from\r\n    Missouri.--Searches for and Seizure of Arms.--Missouri on the\r\n    Side of Peace.--Address of General Price to the People.--\r\n    Proclamation of Governor Jackson.--Humiliating Concessions of\r\n    the Governor to the United States Government, for the sake of\r\n    Peace.--Demands of the Federal Officers.--Revolutionary\r\n    Principles attempted to be enforced by the United States\r\n    Government.--The Action at Booneville.--The Patriot Army of\r\n    Militia.--Further Rout of the Enemy.--Heroism and Self-sacrifice\r\n    of the People.--Complaints and Embarrassments--Zeal: its\r\n    effects.--Action of Congress.--Battle of Springfield.--General\r\n    Price.--Battle at Lexington.--Bales of Hemp.--Other Combats.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve the Union in the spirit and for the purposes for which it\r\nwas established, an equilibrium between the States, as grouped in\r\nsections, was essential. When the Territory of Missouri constitutionally\r\napplied for admission as a State into the Union, the struggle between\r\nState rights and that sectional aggrandizement which was seeking to\r\ndestroy the existing equilibrium gave rise to the contest which shook\r\nthe Union to its foundation, and sowed the seeds of geographical\r\ndivisions, which have borne the most noxious weeds that have choked our\r\npolitical vineyard. Again, in 1861, Missouri appealed to the\r\nConstitution for the vindication of her rights, and again did usurpation\r\nand the blind rage of a sectional party disregard the appeal, and assume\r\npowers, not only undelegated, but in direct violation of the fourth\r\nsection of the fourth article of the Constitution, which every Federal\r\nofficer had sworn to maintain, and which secured to every State a\r\nrepublican government, and protection against invasion.\r\n\r\nIf it be contended that the invasion referred to must have been by other\r\nthan the troops of the United States, and that their troops were\r\ntherefore not prohibited from entering a State against its wishes, and\r\nfor purposes hostile to its policy, the section of the Constitution\r\nreferred to fortifies the fact, heretofore noticed, of the refusal of\r\nthe Convention, when forming the Constitution, to delegate to the\r\nFederal Government power to coerce a State. By its last clause it was\r\nprovided that not even to suppress domestic violence could the General\r\nGovernment, on its own motion, send troops of the United States into the\r\nterritory of one of the States. That section reads thus:\r\n\r\n    \"The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union\r\n    a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them\r\n    against invasion, and on application of the Legislature, or of\r\n    the executive (when the Legislature can not be convened),\r\n    against domestic violence.\"\r\n\r\nSurely, if Federal troops could not be sent into a State without its\r\napplication, even to protect it against domestic violence, still less\r\ncould it be done to overrule the will of its people. That, instead of an\r\nobligation upon the citizens of other States to respond to a call by the\r\nPresident for troops to invade a particular State, it was in April,\r\n1861, deemed a high crime to so use them: reference is here made to the\r\npublished answers of the Governors of States, which had not seceded, to\r\nthe requisition made upon them for troops to be employed against the\r\nStates which had seceded.\r\n\r\nGovernor Letcher, of Virginia, replied to the requisition of the United\r\nStates Secretary of War as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"I am requested to detach from the militia of the State of\r\n    Virginia the quota designated in a table which you append, to\r\n    serve as infantry or riflemen, for the period of three months,\r\n    unless sooner discharged.\r\n\r\n    \"In reply to this communication, I have only to say that the\r\n    militia of Virginia will not be furnished to the powers at\r\n    Washington for any such use or purpose as they have in view.\r\n    Your object is to subjugate the Southern States, and a\r\n    requisition made upon me for such an object--an object, in my\r\n    judgment, not within the purview of the Constitution, or the Act\r\n    of 1795--will not be complied with.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Magoffin, of Kentucky, replied:\r\n\r\n    \"Your dispatch is received. In answer, I say emphatically,\r\n    Kentucky will furnish no troops for the wicked purpose of\r\n    subduing her sister Southern States.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Harris, of Tennessee, replied:\r\n\r\n    \"Tennessee will not furnish a single man for coercion, but fifty\r\n    thousand, if necessary, for the defense of our rights, or those\r\n    of our Southern brothers.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Jackson, of Missouri, answered:\r\n\r\n    \"Requisition is illegal, unconstitutional, revolutionary,\r\n    inhuman, diabolical, and can not be complied with.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Rector, of Arkansas, replied:\r\n\r\n    \"In answer to your requisition for troops from Arkansas, to\r\n    subjugate the Southern States, I have to say that none will be\r\n    furnished. The demand is only adding insult to injury.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Ellis, of North Carolina, responded to the requisition for\r\ntroops from that State as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Your dispatch is received, and, if genuine--which its\r\n    extraordinary character leads me to doubt--I have to say, in\r\n    reply, that I regard the levy of troops made by the\r\n    Administration, for the purpose of subjugating the States of the\r\n    South, as in violation of the Constitution, and a usurpation of\r\n    power. I can be no party to this wicked violation of the laws of\r\n    the country, and to this war upon the liberties of a free\r\n    people. You can get no troops from North Carolina.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Ellis, who had lived long enough to leave behind him an\r\nenviable reputation, was a fair representative of the conservatism,\r\ngallantry, and tenacity in well-doing, of the State over which he\r\npresided. He died too soon for his country's good, and the Confederacy\r\nseriously felt the loss of his valuable services. The prompt and\r\nspirited answer he gave to the call upon North Carolina to furnish\r\ntroops for the subjugation of the Southern States, was the fitting\r\ncomplement of his earlier action in immediately restoring to the Federal\r\nGovernment Forts Johnson and Caswell, which had been seized without\r\nproper authority. In communicating his action to President Buchanan, he\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n    \"My information satisfies me that this popular outbreak was\r\n    caused by a report, very generally credited, but which, for the\r\n    sake of humanity, I hope is not true, that it was the purpose of\r\n    the Administration to coerce the Southern States, and that\r\n    troops were on their way to garrison the Southern ports, and to\r\n    begin the work of subjugation.... Should I receive assurance\r\n    that no troops will be sent to this State prior to the 4th of\r\n    March next, then all will be peace and quiet here, and the\r\n    property of the United States will be fully protected, as\r\n    heretofore. If, however, I am unable to get such assurances, I\r\n    will not undertake to answer for the consequences.\r\n\r\n    \"The forts in this State have long been unoccupied, and their\r\n    being garrisoned at this time will unquestionably be looked upon\r\n    as a hostile demonstration, and will in my opinion certainly be\r\n    resisted.\"\r\n\r\nThe plea so constantly made by the succeeding Administration, as an\r\nexcuse for its warlike acts, that the duty to protect the public\r\nproperty required such action, is shown by this letter of Governor Ellis\r\nto have been a plea created by their usurpations, but for which there\r\nmight have been peace, as well as safety to property, and, what was of\r\ngreater worth, the lives, the liberties, and the republican institutions\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nThere was great similarity in the condition of Missouri to that of\r\nKentucky. They were both border States, and, by their institutions and\r\nthe origin of a large portion of their citizens, were identified with\r\nthe South. Both sought to occupy a neutral position in the impending\r\nwar, and offered guarantees of peace and order throughout their\r\nterritory if left free to control their own affairs. Both refused to\r\nfurnish troops to the United States Government for the unconstitutional\r\npurpose of coercing the Southern States. Both, because of their stronger\r\naffinity to the South than to the North, were the objects of suspicion,\r\nand consequent military occupation by the troops of the United States\r\nGovernment. At the inception of this unwarrantable proceeding, an effort\r\nwas made by the Governor of Missouri to preserve the rights of the State\r\nwithout disturbing its relations to the United States Government. If it\r\nhad been the policy of the Government to allow to Missouri the control\r\nof her domestic affairs, and an exemption from being a party to the\r\nviolation of the Constitution in making war against certain of the\r\nStates, the above-described effort of the Governor might and probably\r\nwould have been successful. The form and purpose of that effort appear\r\nin the compact entered into between Major-General Price, commanding the\r\nmilitia or \"Missouri State Guard,\" and General Harney, of the United\r\nStates Army, commanding the Department of the West, a geographical\r\ndivision which included the State of Missouri.\r\n\r\nDuring a temporary absence of General Harney, Captain Lyon, commanding\r\nUnited States forces at St. Louis, initiated hostilities against the\r\nState of Missouri under the following circumstances:\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the militia law of the State, an annual encampment was\r\ndirected by the Governor for instruction in tactics. Camp Jackson, near\r\nSt. Louis, was designated for the encampment of the militia of the\r\ncounty in 1861. Here for some days companies of State militia, amounting\r\nto about eight hundred men, under command of Brigadier-General D. M.\r\nFrost, were being exercised, as is usual upon such occasions. They\r\npresented no appearance of a hostile camp. There were no sentinels to\r\nguard against surprise; visitors were freely admitted; it was the\r\npicnic-ground for the ladies of the city, and everything wore the aspect\r\nof merry-making rather than that of grim-visaged war.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Captain (afterward General) Nathaniel Lyon appeared with an\r\noverwhelming force of Federal troops, surrounded this holiday\r\nencampment, and demanded an unconditional surrender. Resistance was\r\nimpracticable, and none was attempted; the militia surrendered, and were\r\nconfined as prisoners; but prisoners of what? There was no war, and no\r\nwarrant for their arrest as offenders against the law. It is left for\r\nthe usurpers to frame a vocabulary suited to their act.\r\n\r\nAfter the return of General Harney, Brigadier-General D. M. Frost, of\r\nthe Missouri militia, appealed to him from his prison, the St. Louis\r\nArsenal, on May 11, 1861, representing that, \"in accordance with the\r\nlaws of the State of Missouri, which have been existing for some years,\r\nand in obedience to the orders of the Governor, on Monday last I entered\r\ninto an encampment with the militia force of St. Louis County for the\r\npurpose of instructing the same in accordance with the laws of the\r\nUnited States and of this State.\" He further sets forth that every\r\nofficer and soldier of his command had taken an oath to sustain the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States and of the State of Missouri,\r\nand that while in the peaceable performance of their duties the\r\nencampment was surrounded by the command of Captain N. Lyon, United\r\nStates Army, and a surrender demanded, to which General Frost replied as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    \"Camp Jackson, _May 10, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir: I, never for a moment having conceived the idea that so\r\n    illegal and unconstitutional a demand as I have just received\r\n    from you would be made by an officer of the United States Army,\r\n    am wholly unprepared to defend my command from this unwarranted\r\n    attack, and shall therefore be forced to comply with your\r\n    demand.\r\n\r\n    \"I am sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    \"D. Frost,\r\n\r\n    \"_Brigadier-General, commanding Camp Jackson, M. M._\r\n\r\n    \"Captain N. Lyon, _commanding United States troops_.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Frost's letter to General Harney continues: \"My command was, in\r\naccordance with the above, deprived of their arms, and surrendered into\r\nthe hands of Captain Lyon; after which, while thus disarmed and\r\nsurrounded, a fire was opened on a portion of it by his troops, and a\r\nnumber of my men put to death, together with several innocent\r\nlookers-on, men, women, and children.\" On the occasion of the attack\r\nupon Camp Jackson, \"a large crowd of citizens, men, women, and children,\r\nwere gathered around, gazing curiously at these strange proceedings,\r\nwhen a volley was fired into them, killing ten and wounding twenty\r\nnon-combatants, mostly women and children. A reign of terror was at once\r\nestablished, and the most severe measures were adopted by the Federals\r\nto overawe the excitement and the rage of the people.\"[182]\r\n\r\nThe massacre at Camp Jackson produced intense excitement throughout the\r\nState. The Legislature, upon receipt of the news, passed several bills\r\nfor the enrollment and organization of the militia, and to confer\r\nspecial powers upon the Governor of the State. By virtue of these,\r\ngeneral officers were appointed, chief of whom was Sterling Price.\r\n\r\nBecause of the atrocities at St. Louis, and the violent demonstrations\r\nconsequent upon them, not only in St. Louis but elsewhere in the State,\r\nGeneral Price, well known to be what was termed \"a Union man,\" and not\r\nonly by his commission as commander-in-chief of the militia of the\r\nState, but also, and even more, because of his influence among the\r\npeople, was earnestly solicited by influential citizens of St. Louis to\r\nunite with General Harney in a joint effort to restore order and\r\npreserve peace. With the sanction of Governor Jackson he proceeded to\r\nSt. Louis, the headquarters of the Department of the West, and, after\r\nsome preliminary conference, entered into the following agreement,\r\nwhich, being promulgated to the people, was received with general\r\nsatisfaction, and for a time allayed excitement. The agreement was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    \"St. Louis, _May 21, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"The undersigned, officers of the United States Government and of\r\n    the government of the State of Missouri, for the purpose of\r\n    removing misapprehension and of allaying public excitement, deem\r\n    it proper to declare publicly that they have this day had a\r\n    personal interview in this city, in which it has been mutually\r\n    understood, without the semblance of dissent on either part,\r\n    that each of them has no other than a common object, equally\r\n    interesting and important to every citizen of Missouri--that of\r\n    restoring peace and good order to the people of the State in\r\n    subordination to the laws of the General and State governments.\r\n\r\n    \"It being thus understood, there seems no reason why every\r\n    citizen should not confide in the proper officers of the General\r\n    and State governments to restore quiet, and, as among the best\r\n    means of offering no counter-influences, we mutually commend to\r\n    all persons to respect each other's rights throughout the State,\r\n    making no attempt to exercise unauthorized powers, as it is the\r\n    determination of the proper authorities to suppress all unlawful\r\n    proceedings which can only disturb the public peace. General\r\n    Price, having by commission full authority over the militia of\r\n    the State of Missouri, undertakes with the sanction of the\r\n    Governor of the State, already declared, to direct the whole\r\n    power of the State officers to maintaining order within the\r\n    State among the people thereof. General Harney publicly declares\r\n    that, this object being assured, he can have no occasion, as he\r\n    has no wish, to make military movements that might otherwise\r\n    create excitement and jealousy, which he most earnestly desires\r\n    to avoid.\r\n\r\n    \"We, the undersigned, do therefore mutually enjoin upon the\r\n    people of the State to attend to their civil business, of\r\n    whatever sort it may be, and it is hoped that the unquiet\r\n    elements which have threatened so seriously to disturb the\r\n    public peace may soon subside, and be remembered only to be\r\n    deplored.\r\n\r\n    \"W. S. Harney,\r\n\r\n    \"_Brigadier-General commanding._\r\n\r\n    \"Sterling Price,\r\n\r\n    \"_Major-General Missouri State Guard._\"\r\n\r\nThe distinct position of General Harney, that the military force of the\r\nUnited States should not be used in Missouri except in case of\r\nnecessity, together with the emphatic declaration of General Price that\r\nhe had the power and would use it to preserve peace and order in\r\nMissouri, seemed to remove all danger of collision in that State between\r\nthe Federal and local forces. In conformity with this understanding,\r\nGeneral Price returned to the capital of the State, and sent to their\r\nhomes the militia who had been assembled there by the Governor for the\r\ndefense of the capital against an anticipated attack by the troops of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThose who desired to preserve peace in Missouri had just cause to be\r\ngratified at the favorable prospect now presented. Those who desired war\r\nhad equal ground for dissatisfaction. A few days after the promulgation\r\nof the agreement between General Price and General Harney, the latter\r\nwas removed from command, as many believed, because of his successful\r\nefforts to allay excitement and avoid war. Rumors had been in\r\ncirculation that the Missourians were driving the \"Union men\" from their\r\nhomes, and many letters purporting to be written in different parts of\r\nthe State represented the persecution of Union men. It was suspected\r\nthat many of them were written in St. Louis, or inspired by the cabal.\r\nAn incident related in confirmation of the justice of this suspicion is,\r\nthat General Harney received a letter from St. Joseph, stating that\r\nex-Governor Stewart and a number of the most respectable men in St.\r\nJoseph had been driven from their homes, and that, unless soldiers were\r\nsoon sent, the Union men would all have to leave. He called upon the\r\nHon. F. P. Blair, an influential citizen of St. Louis, and asked him if\r\nhe knew the writer of the letter. The reply was: \"Oh, yes, he is\r\nperfectly reliable; you can believe anything he says.\"[183] General\r\nHarney said he would write immediately to General Price. Dissatisfaction\r\nwas then manifested at such delay; but, two or three days later, a\r\nletter from ex-Governor Stewart was published in the \"St. Joseph News,\"\r\nin which was a marked paragraph of the copy sent to General Harney:\r\n\"Neither I nor any other Union man has been driven out of St. Joe.\"[184]\r\nAn attempt has been made to evade the conclusion that General Harney was\r\nrelieved from command because of his pacific policy. The argument is,\r\nthat the order was dated the 16th of May, and his agreement with General\r\nPrice was on the 21st of the same month, an argument more specious than\r\nfair, as it appears from the letter of President Lincoln of May 18,\r\n1861, to Hon. F. P. Blair, that the order sent from the War Department\r\nto him was to be delivered or withheld at his discretion, and that it\r\nwas not delivered until the 30th of the month, and until after General\r\nHarney had not only entered into his agreement with General Price, but\r\nhad declined to act upon sensational stories of persecution, on which\r\napplications were made to send troops into the interior of Missouri.\r\nDuring the days this order was held for his removal, with discretionary\r\npower to deliver or withhold it, the above-recited events occurred, and\r\nthey may fairly be considered as having decided the question of his\r\nremoval from that command.\r\n\r\nThe principal United States arsenal at the West was that near to St.\r\nLouis. To it had been transferred a large number of the altered muskets\r\nsent from Springfield, Massachusetts, so that in 1861 the arms in that\r\narsenal were, perhaps, numerically second only to those at Springfield.\r\nThese arms, by a conjunction of deceptive and bold measures, were\r\nremoved from the arsenal in Missouri and transported to Illinois. To\r\nwhom did those arms belong? Certainly to those whose money had made or\r\npurchased them. That is, to the States in common, not to their agent the\r\nGeneral Government, or to a portion of the States which might be in a\r\ncondition to appropriate them to their special use, and in disregard of\r\nthe rights of their partners.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with removing the public arms from the limits of Missouri,\r\nthe next step was that, in total disrespect of the constitutional right\r\nof the citizens to bear arms for their own defense, and to be free from\r\nsearches and seizures except by warrants duly issued, the officers of\r\nthe General Government proceeded to search the houses of citizens in St.\r\nLouis, and to seize arms wherever they were found.\r\n\r\nMissouri had refused to engage in war against her sister States of the\r\nSouth; therefore she was first to be disarmed, and then to be made the\r\nvictim of an invasion characterized by such barbarous atrocities as\r\nshame the civilization of the age. The wrongs she suffered, the brave\r\nefforts of her unarmed people to defend their hearthstones and their\r\nliberties against the desecration and destruction of both, form a\r\nmelancholy chapter in the history of the United States, which all who\r\nwould cherish their fair fame must wish could be obliterated.\r\n\r\nThese acts of usurpation and outrage, as well upon the political as\r\npersonal rights of the people of Missouri, aroused an intense feeling in\r\nthat State. It will be remembered that Governor Jackson had responded to\r\nthe call of Mr. Lincoln upon him for troops with the just indignation of\r\none who understood the rights of the State, and the limited powers of\r\nthe General Government. His stern refusal to become a party to the war\r\nupon the South made him the object of special persecution. By his side\r\nin this critical juncture stood the gallant veteran, General Price. To\r\nthe latter was confided the conduct of the military affairs of the\r\nState, and, after exhausting every effort to maintain order by peaceful\r\nmeans, and seeing that the Government would recognize no other method\r\nthan that of force, he energetically applied himself to raise troops,\r\nand procure arms so as to enable the State to meet force by force.\r\nDuring this and all the subsequent period, the Governor and the General\r\nwere ably seconded by the accomplished, gallant, and indefatigable\r\nLieutenant-Governor, Reynolds.\r\n\r\nThe position of Missouri in 1860-'61 was unquestionably that of\r\nopposition to the secession of the State. The people generously confided\r\nin the disposition of the General Government to observe their rights,\r\nand continued to hope for a peaceful settlement of the questions then\r\nagitating the country. This was evinced by the fact that not a single\r\nsecessionist was elected to the State Convention, and that General\r\nPrice, an avowed \"Union man,\" was chosen as President of the Convention.\r\nHence the general satisfaction with the agreement made between Generals\r\nHarney and Price for the preservation of peace and non-intervention by\r\nthe army of the United States. General Harney, the day before the order\r\nfor his removal was communicated to him, wrote to the War Department,\r\nexpressing his confidence in the preservation of peace in Missouri, and\r\nused this significant expression: \"Interference by unauthorized parties\r\nas to the course I shall pursue can alone prevent the realization of\r\nthese hopes.\"[185] The \"unauthorized parties\" here referred to could not\r\nhave been the people or the government of Missouri. Others than they\r\nmust have been the parties wishing to use force, provocative of\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\nAs has been heretofore stated, after his agreement with General Harney\r\nat St. Louis, General Price returned to the capital and dismissed to\r\ntheir homes the large body of militia that had been there assembled.\r\n\r\nAfter the removal of General Harney, believed to be in consequence of\r\nhis determination to avoid the use of military force against the people\r\nof Missouri, reports were rife of a purpose on the part of the\r\nAdministration at Washington to disarm the citizens of Missouri who did\r\nnot sympathize with the views of the Federal Government, and to put arms\r\ninto the hands of those who could be relied on to enforce them. On the\r\n4th of June General Price issued an address to the people of Missouri,\r\nand in reference to that report said: \"The purpose of such a movement\r\ncould not be misunderstood; and it would not only be a palpable\r\nviolation of the agreement referred to, and an equally plain violation\r\nof our constitutional rights, but a gross indignity to the citizens of\r\nthis State, which would be resisted to the last extremity.\"\r\n\r\nThe call of President Lincoln for seventy-five thousand volunteers\r\nremoved any preëxisting doubt as to the intent to coerce the States\r\nwhich should claim to assert their right of sovereignty. Missouri, while\r\navowing her purpose to adhere to the Union, had asserted her right to\r\nexercise supreme control over her domestic affairs, and this put her in\r\nthe category of a State threatened by the proceedings of the United\r\nStates Government. To provide for such contingency as might be\r\nanticipated, Governor Jackson, on the 13th of June, issued a call for\r\nfifty thousand volunteers, and Major-General Price took the field in\r\ncommand. In this proclamation Governor Jackson said:\r\n\r\n    \"A series of unprovoked and unparalleled outrages has been\r\n    inflicted on the peace and dignity of this Commonwealth, and\r\n    upon the rights and liberties of its people, by wicked and\r\n    unprincipled men professing to act under the authority of the\r\n    Government of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nIn his endeavor to maintain the peace of the State, and to avert, if\r\npossible, from its borders a civil war, he caused the aforementioned\r\nagreement to be made with the commander of the Northern forces in the\r\nState, by which its peace might be preserved. That officer was promptly\r\nremoved by his Government. The Governor then, upon the increase of\r\nhostile actions, proposed, at an interview with the new officer\r\ncommanding the forces of the United States Government, to disband the\r\nState Guard, and break up its organization; to disarm all companies that\r\nhad been armed by the State; to pledge himself not to organize the\r\nmilitia under the military bill; that no arms or munitions of war should\r\nbe brought into the State; that he would protect the citizens equally in\r\nall their rights, regardless of their political opinions; that he would\r\nrepress all insurrectionary movements within the State; would repel all\r\nattempts to invade it, from whatever quarter, and by whomsoever made;\r\nand would maintain a strict neutrality and preserve the peace of the\r\nState. And, further, if necessary, he would invoke the assistance of the\r\nUnited States troops to carry out the pledges. The only conditions to\r\nthis proposition made by the Governor were that the United States\r\nGovernment should undertake to disarm the \"Home Guard\" which it had\r\nillegally organized and armed throughout the State, and pledge itself\r\nnot to occupy with its troops any localities in the State not occupied\r\nby them at that time.\r\n\r\nThe words of a Governor of a State who offered such truly generous terms\r\ndeserve to be inserted: \"Nothing but the most earnest desire to avert\r\nthe horrors of civil war from our beloved State could have tempted me to\r\npropose these humiliating terms. They were rejected by the Federal\r\nofficers.\"\r\n\r\nThese demanded not only the disorganization and disarming of the State\r\nmilitia and the nullification of the military bill, but they refused to\r\ndisarm their own \"Home Guard,\" and insisted that the Government of the\r\nUnited States should enjoy an unrestricted right to move and station its\r\ntroops throughout the State whenever and wherever it might, in the\r\nopinion of its officers, be necessary either for the protection of its\r\n\"loyal subjects\" or for the repelling of invasion; and they plainly\r\nannounced that it was the intention of the Administration to take\r\nmilitary occupation of the whole State, and to reduce it, as avowed by\r\nGeneral Lyon, to the \"exact condition of Maryland.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that the revolutionary measures which the United\r\nStates Government had undertaken to enforce involved the subjection of\r\nevery State, either by voluntary submission or subjugation. However much\r\na State might desire peace and neutrality, its own will could not elect.\r\nThe scheme demanded the absolute sovereignty of the Government of the\r\nUnited States, or, in other words, the extinguishment of the\r\nindependence and sovereignty of the State. Human actions are not only\r\nthe fruit of the ruling motive, but they are also the evidence of the\r\nexistence of that motive. Thus, when we see the Governor of the State of\r\nMissouri offering such generous terms to the government of the United\r\nStates in order to preserve peace and neutrality, and the latter,\r\nrejecting them, avow its intention to do its will with the authorities,\r\nthe property, and the citizens of the State, and proceed with military\r\nforce to do it, its actions are both the evidence and the fruit of its\r\ntheory. These measures were revolutionary in the extreme. They involved\r\nthe entire subversion of those principles on which the American Union\r\nwas founded, and of the compact or Constitution of that Union. The\r\nGovernment of the United States, in the hands of those who wielded its\r\nauthority, was made the bloody instrument to establish these usurpations\r\non the ruins of the crushed hopes of mankind for permanent freedom under\r\nconstitutional government. For the justness and truthfulness of these\r\nallegations I appeal to the impartial and sober judgment of posterity.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers who were assembled under this proclamation of Governor\r\nJackson, of June 13th, had few arms except their squirrel-rifles and\r\nshot-guns, and could scarcely be said to have any military equipments.\r\nThe brigadier-generals who were appointed were assigned to geographical\r\ndivisions, and, with such men as they could collect, reported in\r\nobedience to their orders at Booneville and Lexington. On the 20th of\r\nJune, 1861, General Lyon and Colonel F. P. Blair, with an estimated\r\nforce of seven thousand well-armed troops, having eight pieces of\r\nartillery, ascended the Missouri River, and debarked about five miles\r\nbelow Booneville. To oppose them, the Missourians had there about eight\r\nhundred men, poorly armed, without a piece of artillery, and but little\r\nammunition. With courage which must be commended at the expense of their\r\ndiscretion, they resolved to engage the enemy, and, after a combat of an\r\nhour and a half or more, retired, having inflicted heavy loss upon the\r\nenemy, and suffering but little themselves. This first skirmish between\r\nthe Federal troops and the Missouri militia inspired confidence in their\r\nfellow-citizens, and checked the contemptuous terms in which the militia\r\nhad been spoken of by the enemy. Governor Jackson, with some two hundred\r\nand fifty to three hundred of the militia engaged in the action at\r\nBooneville, started toward the southwestern portion of the State. He\r\nmarched in the direction of a place called Cole Camp, and, when within\r\ntwelve or fifteen miles of it, learned that a force of seven hundred to\r\none thousand of the enemy had been sent to that point by General Lyon\r\nand Colonel Blair, with the view of intercepting his retreat. The\r\ndesign, however, was frustrated by an expedition consisting of about\r\nthree hundred and fifty men, commanded by Colonel O'Kane, who had\r\nassembled them in a very few hours in the neighborhood south of the\r\nenemy's camp. There were no pickets out except in the neighborhood of\r\nJackson's forces, and Colonel O'Kane surprised the enemy where they were\r\nasleep in two large barns. The attack was made at daybreak, the enemy\r\nrouted after suffering the heavy loss of two hundred and six killed and\r\nmore wounded, and more than a hundred prisoners. Three hundred and\r\nsixty-two muskets with bayonets were captured. The Missourians lost four\r\nkilled and fifteen or twenty wounded.\r\n\r\nGeneral Price, with a view to draw his army from the baseline of the\r\nenemy, the Missouri River, ordered his troops to the southwestern\r\nportion of the State. The column from Lexington marched without\r\ntransportation, without tents or blankets, and relied for subsistence on\r\nthe country through which it passed, being in the mean time closely\r\npursued by the enemy. The movement was successfully made, and a junction\r\neffected in Cedar County with the forces present with Governor Jackson.\r\nThe total when assembled was about thirty-six hundred men.\r\n\r\n    \"This, then, was the patriot army of Missouri. It was a\r\n    heterogeneous mass representing every condition of Western life.\r\n    There were the old and young, the rich and poor, the grave and\r\n    gay, the planter and laborer, the farmer and clerk, the hunter\r\n    and boatman, the merchant and woodsman. At least five hundred of\r\n    these men were entirely unarmed. Many had only the common rifle\r\n    and shot-gun. None were provided with cartridges or canteens.\r\n    They had eight pieces of cannon, but no shells, and very few\r\n    solid shot, or rounds of grape and canister.\r\n\r\n    \"Rude and almost incredible devices were made to supply these\r\n    wants: trace-chains, iron rods, hard pebbles, and smooth stones\r\n    were substituted for shot; and evidence of the effect of such\r\n    rough missiles was to be given in the next encounter with the\r\n    enemy.\"[186]\r\n\r\nGovernor Jackson continued his march toward southwestern Missouri. He\r\nhad received reliable intelligence that he was pursued by General Lyon\r\nfrom the northeast, and by Lane and Sturgis from the northwest, their\r\nsupposed object being to form a junction in his rear, and he\r\nsubsequently learned that a column numbering three thousand had been\r\nsent out from St. Louis to intercept his retreat, and had arrived at the\r\ntown of Carthage, immediately in his front. These undisciplined, poorly\r\narmed Missourians were, therefore, in a position which would have\r\nappalled less heroic men--a large hostile force in their rear, and\r\nanother, nearly equal in numbers to their own, disputing their passage\r\nin front. They, however, cheerfully moved forward, attacked the enemy in\r\nposition, and, after a severe engagement, routed him, pursued him to a\r\nsecond position, from which he was again driven, falling back to\r\nCarthage, where he made his last stand, and, upon being driven from\r\nwhich, as was subsequently ascertained, continued his retreat all night.\r\nThe killed and wounded of the enemy, left along the route of his retreat\r\nover a space of ten miles, were estimated at from one hundred and fifty\r\nto two hundred killed, and from three to four hundred wounded. Several\r\nhundred muskets were captured, and the Missourians were better prepared\r\nfor future conflicts. Our loss was between forty and fifty killed, and\r\nfrom one hundred and twenty-five to one hundred and fifty wounded.[187]\r\n\r\nIf any shall ask why I have entered into such details of engagements\r\nwhere the forces were comparatively so small, and the results so little\r\naffected the final issue of the war, the reply is, that such heroism and\r\nself-sacrifice as these undisciplined, partially armed, unequipped men\r\ndisplayed against superior numbers, possessed of all the appliances of\r\nwar, claim special notice as bearing evidence not only of the virtue of\r\nthe men, but the sanctity of the cause which could so inspire them.\r\nUnsupported, save by the consciousness of a just cause, without other\r\nsympathy than that which the Confederate States fully gave, despising\r\nthe plea of helplessness, and defying the threats of a powerful\r\nGovernment to crush her, Missouri, without arms or other military\r\npreparation, took up the gauntlet thrown at her feet, and dared to make\r\nwar in defense of the laws and liberties of her people.\r\n\r\nMy motive for promptly removing the seat of government, after authority\r\nwas given by the Provisional Congress, has been heretofore stated, but\r\nproximity to the main army of the enemy, and the flanking attacks by\r\nwhich the new capital was threatened, did not diminish the anxiety,\r\nwhich had been felt before removal from Montgomery, in regard to affairs\r\nin Missouri, the \"far West\" of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nThe State, which forty years before had been admitted to the Union,\r\nagainst sectional resistance to the right guaranteed by the\r\nConstitution, and specifically denominated in the treaty for the\r\nacquisition of Louisiana, now, because her Governor refused to furnish\r\ntroops for the unconstitutional purpose of coercing States, became the\r\nsubject of special hostility and the object of extraordinary efforts for\r\nher subjugation.\r\n\r\nThe little which it would have been possible for the Confederacy to do\r\nto promote her military efficiency was diminished by the anomalous\r\ncondition in which the State troops remained until some time in the\r\nsecond year of the war. A strange misapprehension led to unreasonable\r\ncomplaints, under the supposition that Missouri was generally neglected,\r\nand her favorite officer, General Price, was not accorded a commission\r\ncorresponding to his merit and the wishes of the people. It is due to\r\nthat gallant soldier and true patriot, that it should here be stated\r\nthat he was not a party to any such complaints, knew they were\r\nunfounded, and realized that his wishes for the defense of Missouri were\r\nfully reciprocated by the Executive of the Confederacy; all of which was\r\nmanifested in the correspondence between us, before Missouri had\r\ntendered any troops to the Confederate States. It was his statement of\r\nthe difficulties and embarrassments which surrounded him that caused me\r\nto write to the Governor of Missouri on the 21st of December, 1861,\r\nstating to him my anxiety to have the troops of Missouri tendered and\r\norganized into brigades and divisions, so that they might be rendered\r\nmore effective, and we be better able to provide for them by the\r\nappointment of general officers and otherwise.\r\n\r\nFor a full understanding of the nature and degree of the complaints and\r\nembarrassments referred to, I here insert my reply to letters sent to me\r\nby the Hon. John B. Clarke, M.C., of Missouri:\r\n\r\n    Richmond, Virginia, _January 8, 1862_.\r\n\r\n    \"Hon. John B. Clarke, _Richmond_, _Virginia_.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir: I have received the two letters from Governor Jackson sent\r\n    by you this day. The Governor speaks of delay by the authorities\r\n    of Richmond, and neglect of the interests of Missouri, and\r\n    expresses the hope that he has said enough to be well understood\r\n    by me.\r\n\r\n    \"When I remember that he wrote in reply to my call upon him to\r\n    hasten the tender of Missouri troops, so that they should be put\r\n    upon the footing of those of other States, and with a knowledge\r\n    that as militia of the State I had no power to organize or\r\n    appoint commanders for them, and that it was his duty to attend\r\n    to their wants, but that I had sent an agent of the Confederate\r\n    Government as far as practicable to furnish the necessary\r\n    supplies to the militia of Missouri actually in service, I can\r\n    only say, I hope he is not understood by me. It is but a short\r\n    time since, in a conversation of hours, I fully explained to you\r\n    the ease so far as I am connected with it, and there is nothing\r\n    for me to add to what you then seemed to consider conclusive.\r\n\r\n    \"Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n    \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\nAs is usually the case when citizens are called from their ordinary\r\npursuits for the purposes of war, the people of Missouri did not then\r\nrealize the value of preparation in camp, and were reluctant to enroll\r\nthemselves for long periods. The State, even less than the Confederate\r\nGovernment, could not supply them with the arms, munitions, and equipage\r\nnecessary for campaigns and battles and sieges. Under all these\r\ndisadvantages, it is a matter of well-grounded surprise that they were\r\nable to achieve so much. The Missourians who fought at Vicksburg, and\r\nwho, after that long, trying, and disastrous siege, asked, when in the\r\ncamp of parolled prisoners, not if they could get a furlough, not if\r\nthey might go home when released, but how soon they might hope to be\r\nexchanged and resume their places in the line of battle, show of what\r\nmetal the Missouri troops were made, and of what they were capable when\r\ntempered in the fiery furnace of war.\r\n\r\nI can recall few scenes during the war which impressed me more deeply\r\nthan the spirit of those worn prisoners waiting for the exchange that\r\nwould again permit them to take the hazards of battle for the cause of\r\ntheir country.\r\n\r\nThis memory leads me to recur with regret to my inability, in the\r\nbeginning of the war, to convince the Governor of Missouri of the\r\nnecessity for thorough organization and the enrollment of men for long\r\nterms, instead of loose combinations of militia for periods always short\r\nand sometimes uncertain.\r\n\r\nGeneral Price possessed an extraordinary power to secure the personal\r\nattachment of his troops, and to inspire them with a confidence which\r\nserved in no small degree as a substitute for more thorough training.\r\nHis own enthusiasm and entire devotion to the cause he served were\r\ninfused throughout his followers, and made them all their country's own.\r\nTo Lord Wellington has been attributed the remark that he did not want\r\nzeal in a soldier, and to Napoleon the apothegm that Providence is on\r\nthe side of the heavy battalions. Zeal was oftentimes our main\r\ndependence, and on many a hard-fought field served to drive our small\r\nbattalions, like a wedge, through the serried ranks of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate States, yet in their infancy, and themselves engaged in\r\nan unequal struggle for existence, by act of their Congress declared\r\nthat, if Missouri was engaged in repelling a lawless invasion of her\r\nterritory by armed forces, it was their right and duty to aid the people\r\nand government of said State in resisting such invasion, and in securing\r\nthe means and the opportunity of expressing their will upon all\r\nquestions affecting their rights and liberties. With small means,\r\ncompared to their wants, the Confederate Congress, on the 6th of August,\r\nappropriated one million dollars \"to aid the people of the State of\r\nMissouri in the effort to maintain, within their own limits, the\r\nconstitutional liberty which it is the purpose of the Confederate States\r\nin the existing war to vindicate,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIn the next battle after that of Carthage, which has been noticed,\r\nMissourians were no longer to be alone. General McCullough, commanding a\r\nbrigade of Confederate troops, marched from Arkansas to make a junction\r\nwith General Price, then threatened with an attack by a large force of\r\nthe enemy under General Lyon, which was concentrated near Springfield,\r\nMissouri. The battle was fiercely contested, but finally won by our\r\ntroops. In this action General Lyon was killed while gallantly\r\nendeavoring to rally his discomfited troops, and lead them to the\r\ncharge. While we can not forget the cruel wrongs he had inflicted and\r\nsought still further to impose upon an unoffending people, we must\r\naccord to him the redeeming virtue of courage, and recognize his ability\r\nas a soldier. On this occasion General Price exhibited in two instances\r\nthe magnanimity, self-denial, and humanity which ever characterized him.\r\nGeneral McCulloch claimed the right to command as an officer of the\r\nConfederate States Army. General Price, though he ranked him by a grade,\r\nreplied that \"he was not fighting for distinction, but for the defense\r\nof the liberties of his countrymen, and that it mattered but little what\r\nposition he occupied. He said he was ready to surrender not only the\r\ncommand, but his life, as a sacrifice to the cause.\"[188] He surrendered\r\nthe command and took a subordinate position, though \"he felt assured of\r\nvictory.\"\r\n\r\nThe second instance was an act of humanity to his bitterest enemy.\r\nGeneral Lyon's \"surgeon came in for his body, under a flag of truce,\r\nafter the close of the battle, and General Price sent it in his own\r\nwagon. But the enemy, in his flight, left the body unshrouded in\r\nSpringfield. The next morning, August 11th, Lieutenant-Colonel Gustavus\r\nElgin and Colonel R. H. Musser, two members of Brigadier General\r\nClarke's staff, caused the body to be properly prepared for\r\nburial.\"[189]\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Springfield, General McCulloch returned with his\r\nbrigade to his former position in Arkansas. John C. Fremont had been\r\nappointed a general, and assigned to the command made vacant by the\r\ndeath of General Lyon. He signalized his entrance upon the duty by a\r\nproclamation, confiscating the estates and slave property of \"rebels.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the 10th of September, when General Price was about to go into camp,\r\nhe learned that a detachment of Federal troops was marching from\r\nLexington to Warrensburg, to seize the funds of the bank in that place,\r\nand to arrest and plunder the citizens of Johnson County, in accordance\r\nwith General Fremont's proclamation and instructions.\"[190] General\r\nPrice resumed his march, and, pressing rapidly forward with his mounted\r\nmen, arrived about daybreak at Warrensburg, where he learned that the\r\nenemy had hastily fled about midnight. He then decided to move with his\r\nwhole force against Lexington. He found the enemy in strong\r\nintrenchments, and well supplied with artillery.\r\n\r\nThe place was stubbornly defended. The siege proper commenced on the\r\n18th of September, 1861, and with varying fortunes. Fierce combats\r\ncontinued through that day and the next. On the morning of the 20th\r\nGeneral Price ordered a number of bales of hemp to be transported to the\r\npoint from which the advance of his troops had been repeatedly repulsed.\r\nThey were ranged in a line for a breastwork, and, when rolled before the\r\nmen as they advanced, formed a moving rampart which was proof against\r\nshot, and only to be overcome by a sortie in force, which the enemy did\r\nnot dare to make. On came the hempen breastworks, while Price's\r\nartillery continued an effective fire. In the afternoon of the 20th the\r\nenemy hung out a white flag, upon which General Price ordered a\r\ncessation of firing, and sent to ascertain the object of the signal. The\r\nFederal forces surrendered as prisoners of war, to the number of\r\nthirty-five hundred; also, seven pieces of artillery, over three\r\nthousand stand of muskets, a considerable number of sabres, a valuable\r\nsupply of ammunition, a number of horses, a large amount of commissary's\r\nstores, and other property. Here were also recovered the great seal of\r\nthe State and the public records, and about nine hundred thousand\r\ndollars of which the Bank of Lexington had been robbed. General Price\r\ncaused the money to be at once returned to the bank.\r\n\r\nAfter the first day of the siege of Lexington, General Price learned\r\nthat Lane and Montgomery, from Kansas, with about four thousand men, and\r\nGeneral Sturgis, with fifteen hundred cavalry, were on the north side of\r\nthe Missouri River, advancing to reënforce the garrison at Lexington. At\r\nthe same time, and from the same direction, Colonel Saunders, with about\r\ntwenty-five hundred Missourians, was coming to the aid of General Price.\r\nGeneral D. R. Atchison, who had long been a United States Senator from\r\nMissouri, and at the time of his resignation was President _pro tem._ of\r\nthe Senate, was sent by General Price to meet the command of Colonel\r\nSaunders and hasten them forward. He joined them on the north bank of\r\nthe river, and, after all but about five hundred had been ferried over,\r\nGeneral Atchison still remaining with these, they were unexpectedly\r\nattacked by the force from Kansas. The ground was densely wooded, and\r\npartially covered with water. The Missourians, led and cheered by one\r\nthey had so long and deservedly honored, met the assault with such\r\ndetermination, and fighting with the skill of woodsmen and hunters, that\r\nthey put the enemy to rout, pursuing him for a distance of ten miles,\r\nand inflicting heavy loss upon him, while that of the Missourians was\r\nbut five killed and twenty wounded.\r\n\r\nThe expedient of the bales of hemp was a brilliant conception, not\r\nunlike that which made Tarik, the Saracen warrior, immortal, and gave\r\nhis name to the northern pillar of Hercules.\r\n\r\nThe victories in Missouri which have been noticed, and which so far\r\nexceeded what might have been expected from the small forces by which\r\nthey were achieved, had caused an augmentation of the enemy's troops to\r\nan estimated number of seventy thousand. Against these the army of\r\nGeneral Price could not hope successfully to contend; he therefore\r\nretired toward the southwestern part of the State.\r\n\r\nThe want of supplies and transportation compelled him to disband a\r\nportion of his troops; with the rest he continued his retreat to Neosho.\r\nBy proclamation of Governor Jackson, the Legislature had assembled at\r\nthis place, and had passed the ordinance of secession. If other evidence\r\nwere wanting, the fact that, without governmental aid, without a\r\nmilitary chest, without munitions of war, the campaign which has been\r\ndescribed had so far been carried on by the voluntary service of the\r\ncitizens, and the free-will offerings of the people, must be conclusive\r\nthat the ordinance of secession was the expression of the popular will\r\nof Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe forces of Missouri again formed a junction with the Confederate\r\ntroops under General McCulloch, and together they moved to Pineville, in\r\nMcDonald County.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: See \"Confederate First and Second Missouri Brigades,\"\r\nBevier, pp. 24-26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: See \"Life of General Wm.

Wise, who was well and\r\nfavorably known to the people of the Kanawha Valley, in his enthusiasm\r\nfor their defence and confidence in his ability to rally them to resist\r\nthe threatened invasion of that region, offered his services for that\r\npurpose. With a small command, which was to serve as a nucleus to the\r\nforce he hoped to raise, he was sent thither. His success was as great\r\nas could have been reasonably expected, and, after the small but\r\nbrilliant affair on Scary Creek, he prepared to give battle to the enemy\r\nthen advancing up the Kanawha Valley under General Cox; but the defeat\r\nof our forces at Laurel Hill, which has been already noticed, uncovered\r\nhis right flank and endangered his rear, which was open to approach by\r\nseveral roads; he therefore fell back to Lewisburg.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General John B. Floyd had in the mean time raised a brigade in\r\nsouthwestern Virginia, and advanced to the support of General Wise.\r\nUnfortunately, there was a want of concert between these two officers,\r\nwhich prevented their entire coöperation. General Floyd engaged the\r\nenemy in several brilliant skirmishes, when he found that his right was\r\nthreatened by a force which was approaching on that flank, with the\r\napparent purpose of crossing the Gauley River at the Carnifex Ferry so\r\nas to strike his line of communication with Lewisburg. He crossed the\r\nriver with his brigade and a part of Wise's cavalry, leaving that\r\ngeneral to check any advance which Cox might make. General Floyd's\r\nmovement was as successful as it was daring; he met the enemy's forces,\r\ndefeated and dispersed them, but the want of coöperation between\r\nGenerals Wise and Floyd prevented a movement against General Cox.\r\n\r\nFloyd intrenched himself on the Gauley, in a position of great natural\r\nstrength, but the small force under his command and the fact that he was\r\nseparated from that of General Wise probably induced General Rosecrans,\r\ncommanding the enemy's forces in the Cheat Mountain, to advance and\r\nassail the position. Though his numbers were vastly superior, the attack\r\nwas a failure; after a heavy loss on the part of the enemy, he fell back\r\nafter nightfall. During the night Floyd crossed the river and withdrew\r\nto the camp of General Wise, to form a junction of the two forces, and\r\ntogether they fell back toward Sewell's Mountain. The unfortunate\r\ncontroversy between these officers, which had prevented coöperation in\r\nthe past, grew more bitter, and each complained of the other in terms\r\nthat left little hope of future harmony; and this want of coöperation\r\nled to confusion, and threatened further reverses.\r\n\r\nGeneral Loring had succeeded General Garnett, and was in command of the\r\nremnant of the force defeated at Laurel Hill. His headquarters were at\r\nValley Mountain. General R. E. Lee, on duty at Richmond, aiding the\r\nPresident in the general direction of military affairs, was now ordered\r\nto proceed to western Virginia. It was hoped that, by his military skill\r\nand deserved influence over men, he would be able to retrieve the\r\ndisaster we had suffered at Laurel Hill, and, by combining all our\r\nforces in western Virginia on one plan of operations, give protection to\r\nthat portion of our country. Such reënforcement as could be furnished\r\nhad been sent to Valley Mountain, the headquarters of General Loring.\r\nThither General Lee promptly proceeded. The duty to which he was\r\nassigned was certainly not attractive by the glory to be gained or the\r\nease to be enjoyed, but Lee made no question as to personal preference,\r\nand, whatever were his wishes, they were subordinate to what was\r\nbelieved to be the public interest.\r\n\r\nThe season had been one of extraordinary rains, rendering the\r\nmountain-roads, ordinarily difficult, almost impassable. With\r\nunfaltering purpose and energy, he crossed the Alleghany Mountains, and,\r\nlearning that the main encampment of the enemy was in the valley of\r\nTygart River and Elk Run, Randolph County, he directed his march toward\r\nthat position. The troops under the immediate command of\r\nBrigadier-General H. R. Jackson, together with those under\r\nBrigadier-General Loring, were about thirty-five hundred men. The force\r\nof the enemy, as far as it could be ascertained, was very much greater.\r\nIn the detached work at Cheat Mountain Pass, we learned by a\r\nprovision-return, found upon the person of a captured staff-officer,\r\nthat there were three thousand men, being but a fraction less than our\r\nwhole force. After a careful reconnaissance, and a full conference with\r\nGeneral Loring, Lee decided to attack the main encampment of the enemy\r\nby a movement of his troops converging upon the valley from three\r\ndirections. The colonel of one of his regiments, who had reconnoitered\r\nthe position of the works at Cheat Mountain Pass, reported that it was\r\nfeasible to turn it and carry it by assault, and he was assigned to that\r\nduty. General Lee ordered other portions of his force to take position\r\non the spurs overlooking the enemy's main encampment, while he led three\r\nregiments to the height below and nearest to the position of the enemy.\r\nThe instructions were that the officer sent to turn the position at\r\nCheat Mountain Pass should approach it at early dawn, and immediately\r\nopen fire, which was to be the signal for the concerted attack by the\r\nrest of the force. It rained heavily during the day, and, after a\r\ntoilsome night-march, the force led by General Lee, wet, weary, hungry,\r\nand cold, gained their position close to and overlooking the enemy's\r\nencampment. In their march they had surprised and captured the picket,\r\nwithout a gun being fired, so that no notice had been given of their\r\napproach.\r\n\r\nThe officer who had been sent to attack the work at Cheat Mountain Pass\r\nfound on closer examination that he had been mistaken as to the\r\npracticability of taking it by assault, and that the heavy abatis which\r\ncovered it was advanced beyond the range of his rifles. Not having\r\nunderstood that his firing was to be the signal for the general attack,\r\nand should therefore be opened, whether it would be effective or not, he\r\nwithdrew without firing a musket.\r\n\r\nThe height occupied by General Lee was shrouded in fog, and, as morning\r\nhad dawned without the expected signal, he concluded that some mishap\r\nhad befallen the force which was to make it. By a tortuous path he went\r\ndown the side of the mountain low enough to have a distinct view of the\r\ncamp. He saw the men, unconscious of the near presence of an enemy,\r\nengaged in cleaning their arms, cooking, and other morning occupations;\r\nthen returning to his command, he explained to his senior officers what\r\nhe had seen, and expressed his belief that, though the plan of attack\r\nhad failed, the troops there with him could surprise and capture the\r\ncamp. The officers withdrew, conferred with their men, and reported to\r\nthe General that the troops were not in condition for the enterprise. As\r\nthe fog was then lifting, and they would soon be revealed to the enemy\r\nbelow, whose numbers were vastly superior to his own, he withdrew his\r\ncommand by the route they had come, and without observation returned to\r\nhis camp. Beyond some skirmishes with outposts and reconnoitering\r\nparties, our troops had not been engaged, and in these affairs our\r\nreported loss was comparatively small.\r\n\r\nColonel John A. Washington, aide-de-camp of General Lee, was killed,\r\nwhile making a reconnaissance, by a party in ambuscade. The loss of this\r\nvaluable and accomplished officer was much regretted by his general and\r\nall others who knew him.\r\n\r\nThe report that Rosecrans and Cox had united their commands and were\r\nadvancing upon Wise and Floyd caused General Lee to move at once to\r\ntheir support. He found General Floyd at Meadow Bluff and General Wise\r\nat Sewell Mountain. The latter position being very favorable for\r\ndefense, the troops were concentrated there to await the threatened\r\nattack by Rosecrans, who advanced and took position in sight of General\r\nLee's intrenched camp, and, having remained there for more than a week,\r\nwithdrew in the night without attempting the expected attack.\r\n\r\nThe weak condition of his artillery-horses and the bad state of the\r\nroads, made worse by the retiring army, prevented General Lee from\r\nattempting to pursue; and the approach of winter, always rigorous in\r\nthat mountain-region, closed the campaign with a small but brilliant\r\naction in which General H. R. Jackson repelled an attack of a greatly\r\nsuperior force, inflicting severe loss on the assailants, and losing but\r\nsix of his own command.\r\n\r\nWith the close of active operations, General Lee returned to Richmond,\r\nand, though subjected to depreciatory criticism by the carpet-knights\r\nwho make campaigns on assumed hypotheses, he with characteristic\r\nself-abnegation made no defense of himself, not even presenting an\r\nofficial report of his night-march in the Cheat Mountain, but orally he\r\nstated to me the facts which have formed the basis of this sketch. My\r\nestimate of General Lee, my confidence in his ability, zeal, and\r\nfidelity, rested on a foundation not to be shaken by such criticism as I\r\nhave noticed. I had no more doubt then, than after his fame had been\r\nsecurely established, that, whenever he had the opportunity to prove his\r\nworth, he would secure public appreciation. Therefore, as affairs on the\r\ncoast of South Carolina and Georgia were in an unsatisfactory condition,\r\nhe was directed to go there and take such measures for the defense,\r\nparticularly of Savannah and Charleston, as he should find needful. Lest\r\nthe newspaper attack should have created unjust and unfavorable\r\nimpressions in regard to him, I thought it desirable to write to\r\nGovernor Pickens and tell him what manner of man he was who had been\r\nsent to South Carolina.\r\n\r\nAfter the withdrawal of the Confederate army from Fairfax Court-House\r\nand the positions which had been occupied in front of that place, a\r\nmovement was made by the enemy to cross the Potomac near Leesburg, where\r\nwe had, under the command of Brigadier General N. S. Evans, of South\r\nCarolina, four regiments of infantry (i.e., the Thirteenth, Seventeenth,\r\nand Eighteenth Mississippi, and the Eighth Virginia), commanded\r\nrespectively by Colonels Barksdale, Featherston, Burt, and Hunton, a\r\nsmall detachment of cavalry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Jenifer, and some\r\npieces of artillery.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of October the enemy commenced crossing the river at\r\nEdwards's Ferry. A brigade was thrown over and met by the Thirteenth\r\nMississippi, which held them in check at the point of crossing. In the\r\nmean time another brigade was thrown over at Ball's Bluff, and, as\r\ntroops continued to cross at that point, where the Eighth Virginia had\r\nengaged them, General Evans ordered up the Seventeenth and Eighteenth\r\nMississippi, and the three regiments made such an impetuous attack as to\r\ndrive back the enemy to the bluff, and their leader, Colonel Baker,\r\nhaving fallen, a panic seemed to seize the command, so that they rushed\r\nheadlong down the bluff, and crowded into the flat-boats, which were\r\ntheir means of transportation, in such numbers that they were sunk, and\r\nmany of the foe were drowned in their attempt to swim the river. The\r\nloss of the enemy, prisoners included, exceeded the number of our troops\r\nin the action. The Confederate loss was reported to be thirty-six\r\nkilled, one hundred and seventeen wounded, and two captured; total, one\r\nhundred and fifty-five. Among the killed was the gallant Colonel Burt, a\r\nmuch-respected citizen of Mississippi, where he had held high civil\r\nstation, and where his death was long deplored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n    The Issue.--The American Idea of Government.--Who was\r\n    responsible for the War?--Situation of Virginia.--Concentration\r\n    of the Enemy against Richmond.--Our Difficulty.--Unjust\r\n    Criticisms.--The Facts set forth.--Organization of the\r\n    Army.--Conference at Fairfax Court-House.--Inaction of the\r\n    Army.--Capture of Romney.--Troops ordered to retire to the\r\n    Valley.--Discipline.--General Johnston regards his Position as\r\n    unsafe.--The First Policy.--Retreat of General Johnston.--The\r\n    Plans of the Enemy.--Our Strength magnified by the\r\n    Enemy.--Stores destroyed.--The Trent Affair.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the Southern States, by their representatives in\r\nthe two Houses of Congress, consistently endeavored even to the last\r\nday, when they were by their constituents permitted to remain in the\r\nhalls of Federal legislation, to maintain the Constitution, and preserve\r\nthe Union which the States had by their independent action ordained and\r\nestablished. On the other hand, proof has been adduced to show that the\r\nNorthern States, by a majority of their representatives in the Congress,\r\nhad persisted in agitation injurious to the welfare and tranquillity of\r\nthe Southern States, and at the last moment had refused to make any\r\nconcessions, or to offer any guarantees to check the current toward\r\nsecession of the complaining States, whose love for the Union rendered\r\nthem willing to accept less than justice should have readily accorded.\r\nThe issue was then presented between submission to empire of the North,\r\nor the severance of those ties consecrated by many memories, and\r\nstrengthened by those habits which render every people reluctant to\r\nsever long-existing associations.\r\n\r\nThe authorities heretofore cited have, I must believe, conclusively\r\nshown that the question of changing their government was one that the\r\nStates had the power to decide by virtue of the unalienable right\r\nannounced in the Declaration of Independence, and which had been proudly\r\ndenominated the American idea of government. The hope and the wish of\r\nthe people of the South were that the disagreeable necessity of\r\nseparation would be peacefully met, and be followed by such commercial\r\nregulations as would least disturb the prosperity and future intercourse\r\nof the separated States. Every step taken by the Confederate Government\r\nwas directed toward that end. The separation of the States having been\r\ndecided on, it was sought to effect it in such manner as would be just\r\nto the parties concerned, and preserve as far as possible, under\r\nseparate governments, the fraternal and mutually beneficial relations\r\nwhich had existed between the States when united, and which it was the\r\nobject of their compact of union to secure. To all the proofs heretofore\r\noffered I confidently refer for the establishment of the fact that\r\nwhatever of bloodshed, of devastation, or shock to republican government\r\nhas resulted from the war, is to be charged to the Northern States. The\r\ninvasions of the Southern States, for purposes of coercion, were in\r\nviolation of the written Constitution, and the attempt to subjugate\r\nsovereign States, under the pretext of \"preserving the Union,\" was alike\r\noffensive to law, to good morals, and the proper use of language. The\r\nUnion was the voluntary junction of free and independent States; to\r\nsubjugate any of them was to destroy constituent parts, and necessarily,\r\ntherefore, must be the destruction of the Union itself.\r\n\r\nThat the Southern States were satisfied with a Federal Government such\r\nas their fathers had formed, was shown by their adoption of a\r\nConstitution so little differing from the instrument of 1787. It was\r\nagainst the violations of that instrument, and usurpations offensive to\r\ntheir pride and injurious to their interests, that they remonstrated,\r\nargued, and finally appealed to the inherent, undelegated power of the\r\nStates to judge of their wrongs, and of the \"mode and measure of\r\nredress.\"\r\n\r\nAfter many years of fruitless effort to secure from their Northern\r\nassociates a faithful observance of the compact of union; after its\r\nconditions had been deliberately and persistently broken, and the signs\r\nof the times indicated further and more ruthless violations of their\r\nrights as equals in the Union, the Southern States, preferring a\r\npeaceful separation to continuance in a hostile Union, decided to\r\nexercise their sovereign right to withdraw from an association which had\r\nfailed to answer the ends for which it was formed. It has been shown how\r\nthey endeavored to effect the change with strict regard to the\r\nprinciples controlling a dissolution of partnership, and how earnestly\r\nthey desired to remain in friendly relations to the Northern States, and\r\nhow all their overtures were rejected. When they pleaded for peace, the\r\nUnited States Government deceptively delayed to answer, while making\r\nready for war. To the calm judgment of mankind is submitted the\r\nquestion, Who was responsible for the war between the States?\r\n\r\nVirginia, whose history, from the beginning of the Revolution of 1776,\r\nhad been a long course of sacrifices for the benefit of her sister\r\nStates, and for the preservation of the Union she had mainly contributed\r\nto establish, clung to it with the devotion of a mother. It has been\r\nshown how her efforts to check dissolution were persisted in when the\r\naggrieved were hopeless and the aggressors reckless, and how her\r\nmediations were rejected in the \"Peace Congress,\" which on her motion\r\nhad been assembled. Sorrowing over the failure of this, her blessed\r\nthough unsuccessful attempt to preserve the Union _of the Constitution_,\r\nshe was not permitted to mourn as a neutral, but was required by the\r\nUnited States Government to choose between furnishing troops to\r\nsubjugate her Southern sisters or the reclamation of the grants she had\r\nmade to the Federal Government when she became a member of the Union.\r\nThe first was a violation of the letter and the spirit of the\r\nConstitution; the second was a reserved right. The voice of Henry called\r\nto her from the ground; the spirits of Washington and Jefferson moved\r\namong her people.\r\n\r\nThere was but one course consistent with her stainless reputation and\r\noften-declared tenets, as to the liberties of her people, which she\r\ncould have adopted. As in 1776, reluctantly she bowed to the necessity\r\nof separation from the Crown, so in 1861 the ordinance of secession was\r\nadopted. Having exhausted all other means, she took the last resort,\r\nand, if for this she was selected as the first object of assault,\r\n\"methinks the punishment exceedeth the offense.\"\r\n\r\nThe large resources and full preparation of the United States Government\r\nenabled it to girt Virginia as with a wall of fire. It has been shown\r\nthat she was threatened from the east, from the north, and from the\r\nwest. The capital of the State and of the Confederacy, Richmond, was the\r\nobjective point, and on this the march of three columns concentrated. On\r\nthe east, the advance of the enemy was on several occasions feasible,\r\nwhen we consider the number of his forces at and about Fortress Monroe,\r\nin comparison with the small means retained for the defense of the\r\ncapital. On the north, the most formidable army of the enemy was\r\nassembled; to oppose it we had the comparatively small Army of the\r\nPotomac. This being regarded as the line on which the greatest danger\r\nwas apprehended, our efforts were mostly directed toward giving it the\r\nrequisite strength. Troops, as rapidly as they could be raised and\r\narmed, were sent forward for that purpose. From the beginning to the\r\nclose of the war, we mainly relied for the defense of the capital on its\r\naged citizens, boys too young for service, and the civil employees of\r\nthe executive departments. On several occasions these were called out to\r\nresist an attack. They answered with alacrity, and always bore\r\nthemselves gallantly, more than once repelling the enemy in the open\r\nfield. Had it been practicable to do so, it would surely have been\r\nproper to keep a large force in reserve for the defense of the capital,\r\nso often and vauntingly proclaimed to be the object of the enemy's\r\ncampaign. Perhaps the propriety of such provision gave currency and\r\ncredence to rumors that we had a large force at Richmond. This even led\r\nto the application for a detachment from it to reënforce our Army of the\r\nPotomac, which caused me to write to General J. E. Johnston at Manassas,\r\nVirginia, on September 5, 1861, as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"You have again been deceived as to the forces here. We never\r\n    have had anything near to twenty thousand men, and have now but\r\n    little over one fourth of that number.... Since the date of your\r\n    glorious victory the enemy have grown weaker in numbers, and far\r\n    weaker in the character of their troops, so that I had felt it\r\n    remained with us to decide whether another battle should soon be\r\n    fought or not. Your remark indicates a different opinion.... I\r\n    wish I could send additional force to occupy Loudon, but my\r\n    means are short of the wants of each division I am laboring to\r\n    protect. One ship-load of small-arms would enable me to answer\r\n    all demands, but vainly have I hoped and waited.\"\r\n\r\nThen, there, and everywhere, our difficulty was the want of arms and\r\nmunitions of war. Lamentable cries came to us from the West for the\r\nsupplies which would enable patriotic citizens to defend their homes.\r\nThe resource upon which the people had so confidently relied, the\r\nprivate arms in the hands of citizens, proved a sad delusion, and\r\nelsewhere it has been shown how deficient we were in ammunition, or the\r\nmeans of providing it. The simple fact was, the country had gone to war\r\nwithout counting the cost.\r\n\r\nUndue elation over our victory at Manassas was followed by\r\ndissatisfaction at what was termed the failure to reap the fruits of\r\nvictory; and rumors, for which there could be no better excuse than\r\npartisan zeal, were circulated that the heroes of the hour were\r\nprevented from reaping the fruits of the victory by the interference of\r\nthe President. Naturally there followed another rumor, that the inaction\r\nof the victorious army, to which reënforcements continued to be sent,\r\nwas due to the policy of the President; and he also was held\r\nresponsible, and with more apparent justice, for the failure to organize\r\nthe troops of the several States, as the law contemplated, into brigades\r\nand divisions composed of the soldiers of each.\r\n\r\nThough these unjust criticisms weakened the power of the Government to\r\nmeet its present and provide for its future necessities, I bore them in\r\nsilence, lest to vindicate myself should injure the public service by\r\nturning the public censure to the generals on whom the hopes of the\r\ncountry rested. That motive no longer exists; and, to justify the faith\r\nof those who, without a defense continued to uphold my hands, I propose\r\nto set forth the facts by correspondence and otherwise. So far as, in\r\ndoing this, blame shall be transferred from me to others, it will be the\r\nincident, not the design, as it would be most gratifying to me only to\r\nnotice for praise each and all who wore the gray.\r\n\r\nThe fiction of my having prevented the pursuit of the enemy after the\r\nvictory of Manassas was exploded after it had acquired an authoritative\r\nand semi-official form in the manner and for the reasons heretofore set\r\nforth. It only remains, therefore, to notice the other points indicated\r\nabove:\r\n\r\nFirst, the organization of the army.\r\n\r\nDisease and discontent are known to be the attendants of armies lying\r\nunemployed in camps, especially, as in our case, when the troops were\r\ncomposed of citizens called from their homes under the idea of a\r\npressing necessity, and with the hope of soon returning to them.\r\n\r\nOur citizen soldiers were a powerful political element, and their\r\ncorrespondence, finding its way to the people through the press and to\r\nthe halls of Congress by direct communication with the members, was\r\nfelt, by its influence both upon public opinion and general legislation.\r\nMembers of Congress, and notably the Vice-President, contended that men\r\nshould be allowed to go home and attend to their private affairs while\r\nthere were no active operations, and that there was no doubt but that\r\nthey would return whenever there was to be a battle. The experience of\r\nwar soon taught our people the absurdity of such ideas, and before its\r\nclose probably none would have uttered them.\r\n\r\nThere were very many men out of the army who were anxious to enter it,\r\nbut for whom we had not arms. This gave rise to the remark, more\r\nhumorous than profound, that we \"stood around the camps with clubs to\r\nkeep one set in and an other set out.\" Had this been true, it was\r\ncertainly justifiable to refuse to exchange a trained man for a recruit.\r\nAll who have seen service know that one old soldier is, in campaign,\r\nequal to several who have everything of military life to learn.\r\n\r\nA marked characteristic of the Southern people was individuality, and\r\ntime was needful to teach them that the terrible machine, a disciplined\r\narmy, must be made of men who had surrendered their freedom of will. The\r\nmost distinguished of our citizens were not the slowest to learn the\r\nlesson, and perhaps no army ever more thoroughly knew it than did that\r\nwhich Lee led into Pennsylvania, and none ever had a leader who in his\r\nown conduct better illustrated the lesson.\r\n\r\nOur largest army in 1861 was that of the Potomac. It had been formed by\r\nthe junction of the forces under General J. E. Johnston with those under\r\nGeneral P. G. T. Beauregard, with such additions as could be hurriedly\r\nsent forward to meet the enemy on the field of Manassas. They were\r\ncombined into brigades and divisions as pressing exigencies required.\r\n\r\nBy the act of February 28, 1861, the President was authorized to receive\r\ncompanies, battalions, and regiments to form a part of the provisional\r\narmy of the Confederate States, and, with the advice and consent of\r\nCongress, to appoint general officers for them; and by the act of March\r\n6th the President was to apportion the staff and general officers among\r\nthe respective States from which the volunteers were received. It will\r\nthus be seen that the States generously surrendered their right to\r\npreserve for those volunteers the character of State troops and to\r\nappoint general officers when furnishing a sufficient number of\r\nregiments to require such grade for their command; but, in giving their\r\nvolunteers to form the provisional army of the Confederacy, it was\r\ndistinctly suggested that the general officers should be so appointed as\r\nto make a just apportionment among the States furnishing the troops.\r\n\r\nDuring the repose which followed the battle of Manassas, it was deemed\r\nproper that the regiments of the different States should be assembled in\r\nbrigades together, and, as far as consistent with the public service,\r\nthat the spirit of the law should be complied with by the assignment of\r\nbrigadier-generals of the same State from which the troops were drawn.\r\nInstructions to that end were therefore given, and again and again\r\nrepeated, but were for a long time only partially complied with, until\r\nthe delay formed the basis of the argument that those who had by\r\nassociation become thoroughly acquainted would more advantageously be\r\nleft united. In the mean time, frequent complaints came to me from the\r\narmy, of unjust discrimination, the law being executed in regard to the\r\ntroops of some States but not of others, and of serious discontent\r\narising therefrom.\r\n\r\nThe duty to obey the law was imperative, and neither the Executive nor\r\nthe officers of the army had any right to question its propriety. I,\r\nhowever, considered the policy of that law wise, and was not surprised\r\nwhen it was stated to me that the persistent obstruction to its\r\nexecution was repressing the spirit to volunteer in places to which\r\ncomplaints of such supposed favoritism had been transmitted.\r\n\r\nAbout the 1st of October, at the request of General Johnston, I went to\r\nhis headquarters, at Fairfax Court-House, for the purpose of conference.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this visit to the army, the attention of the general\r\nofficers, who then met me in conference, was called to the obligation\r\ncreated by law to organize the troops, when the numbers tendered by any\r\nState permitted it, into brigades and divisions composed of the\r\nregiments, battalions, or companies of such State, and to assign general\r\nand staff officers in the ratio of the troops thus received. After my\r\nreturn to the capital, the importance of the subject weighed so heavily\r\nupon me as to lead to correspondence with the generals, which will be\r\nbest understood by the following extracts from my letters to them--which\r\nare here appended:\r\n\r\n    \"Major-General G. W. Smith, _Army of Potomac_.\r\n\r\n    \"... How have you progressed in the solution of the problem I\r\n    left--the organization of the troops with reference to the\r\n    States, and term of service? If the volunteers continue their\r\n    complaints that they are commanded by strangers and do not get\r\n    justice, and that they are kept in camp to die when reported for\r\n    hospital by the surgeon, we shall soon feel a reaction in the\r\n    matter of volunteering. Already I have been much pressed on both\r\n    subjects, and have answered by promising that the generals would\r\n    give due attention, and, I hoped, make satisfactory changes. The\r\n    authority to organize regiments into brigades and the latter\r\n    into divisions is by law conferred only on the President; and I\r\n    must be able to assume responsibility of the action taken by\r\n    whomsoever acts for me in that regard. By reference to the law,\r\n    you will see that, in surrendering the sole power to appoint\r\n    general officers, it was nevertheless designed, as far as should\r\n    be found consistent, to keep up the State relation of troops and\r\n    generals. Kentucky has a brigadier, but not a brigade; she has,\r\n    however, a regiment--that regiment and brigadier might be\r\n    associated together. Louisiana had regiments enough to form a\r\n    brigade, but no brigadier in either corps; all of the regiments\r\n    were sent to that corps commanded by a Louisiana general.\r\n    Georgia has regiments now organized into two brigades; she has\r\n    on duty with that army two brigadiers, but one of them serves\r\n    with other troops. Mississippi troops were scattered as if the\r\n    State were unknown. Brigadier-General Clark was sent to remove a\r\n    growing dissatisfaction, but, though the State had nine\r\n    regiments there, he (Clark) was put in command of a post and\r\n    depot of supplies. These nine regiments should form two\r\n    brigades. Brigadiers Clark and (as a native of Mississippi)\r\n    Whiting should be placed in command of them, and the regiments\r\n    for the war put in the army man's brigade. Both brigades should\r\n    be put in the division commanded by General Van Dorn, of\r\n    Mississippi. Thus would the spirit and intent of the law be\r\n    complied with, disagreeable complaint be spared me, and more of\r\n    content be assured under the trials to which you look forward.\r\n    It is needless to specify further. I have been able in writing\r\n    to you to speak freely, and you have no past associations to\r\n    disturb the judgment to be passed upon the views presented. I\r\n    have made and am making inquiries as to the practicability of\r\n    getting a corps of negroes for laborers to aid in the\r\n    construction of an intrenched line in rear of your present\r\n    position.\r\n\r\n    \"Your remarks on the want of efficient staff-officers are\r\n    realized in all their force, and I hope, among the elements\r\n    which constitute a staff-officer for volunteers, you have duly\r\n    estimated the qualities of forbearance and urbanity. Many of the\r\n    privates are men of high social position, of scholarship and\r\n    fortune. Their pride furnishes the motive for good conduct, and,\r\n    if wounded, is turned from an instrument of good to one of great\r\n    power for evil....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Richmond, Virginia, _October 16, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    \"General Beauregard, _Manassas, Virginia_.\r\n\r\n    \"... I have thought often upon the questions of reorganization\r\n    which were submitted to you, and it has seemed to me that,\r\n    whether in view of disease, or the disappointment and suffering\r\n    of a winter cantonment on a line of defense, or of a battle to\r\n    be fought in and near your position, it was desirable to combine\r\n    the troops, by a new distribution, with as little delay as\r\n    practicable. They will be stimulated to extraordinary effort\r\n    when so organized, in that the fame of their State will be in\r\n    their keeping, and that each will feel that his immediate\r\n    commander will desire to exalt rather than diminish his\r\n    services. You pointed me to the fact that you had observed that\r\n    rule in the case of the Louisiana and Carolina troops, and you\r\n    will not fail to perceive that others find in the fact a reason\r\n    for the like disposal of them. In the hour of sickness, and the\r\n    tedium of waiting for spring, men from the same region will best\r\n    console and relieve each other. The maintenance of our cause\r\n    rests on the sentiments of the people. Letters from the camp,\r\n    complaining of inequality and harshness in the treatment of the\r\n    men, have already dulled the enthusiasm which filled our ranks\r\n    with men who by birth, fortune, education, and social position\r\n    were the equals of any officer in the land. The spirit of our\r\n    military law is manifested in the fact that the State\r\n    organization was limited to the regiment. The volunteers come in\r\n    sufficient numbers to have brigadiers, but have only colonels.\r\n    It was not then intended (is the necessary conclusion) that\r\n    those troops should be under the immediate command of officers\r\n    above the grade of colonel. The spirit of the law, then,\r\n    indicates that brigades should be larger than customary, the\r\n    general being charged with the care, the direction, the\r\n    preservation of the men, rather than the internal police.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Richmond, Virginia, _October_ 20, 1861.\r\n\r\n    \"General Beauregard, _Manassas, Virginia_.\r\n\r\n    \"My Dear General:... Two rules have been applied in the\r\n    projected reorganization of the Army of the Potomac:\r\n\r\n    \"1. As far as practicable, to keep regiments from the same State\r\n    together; 2. To assign generals to command the troops of their\r\n    own State. I have not overlooked the objections to each, but the\r\n    advantages are believed to outweigh the disadvantages of that\r\n    arrangement. In distributing the regiments of the several States\r\n    it would, I think, be better to place the regiments for the war\r\n    in the same brigade of the State, and assign to those brigades\r\n    the brigadiers whose services could least easily be dispensed\r\n    with. For this, among other reasons, I will mention but one: the\r\n    commission of a brigadier expires upon the breaking up of his\r\n    brigade (see the law for their appointment). Of course, I would\r\n    not for slight cause change the relations of troops and\r\n    commanders, especially where it has been long continued and\r\n    endeared by the trials of battle; but it is to be noted that the\r\n    regiment was fixed as the unit of organization, and made the\r\n    connecting link between the soldier and his home. Above that,\r\n    all was subject to the discretion of the Confederate\r\n    authorities, save the pregnant intimation in relation to the\r\n    distribution of generals among the several States. It was\r\n    generous and confiding to surrender entirely to the Confederacy\r\n    the appointment of generals, and it is the more incumbent on me\r\n    to carry out as well as may be the spirit of the volunteer\r\n    system.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Richmond, _May 10, 1862_.\r\n\r\n    \"General J. E. Johnston.\r\n\r\n    \"... Your attention has been heretofore called to the law in\r\n    relation to the organization of brigades and divisions--orders\r\n    were long since given to bring the practice and the law into\r\n    conformity. Recently reports have been asked for from the\r\n    commanders of separate armies as to the composition of their\r\n    respective brigades and divisions. I have been much harassed,\r\n    and the public interest has certainly suffered, by the delay to\r\n    place the regiments of some of the States in brigades together,\r\n    it being deemed that unjust discrimination was made against\r\n    them, and also by the popular error which has existed as to the\r\n    number of brigadiers to which appointments could be specially\r\n    urged on the grounds of residence. While some have expressed\r\n    surprise at my patience when orders to you were not observed, I\r\n    have at least hoped that you would recognize the desire to aid\r\n    and sustain you, and that it would produce the corresponding\r\n    action on your part. The reasons formerly offered have one after\r\n    another disappeared, and I hope you will, as you can, proceed to\r\n    organize your troops as heretofore instructed, and that the\r\n    returns will relieve us of the uncertainty now felt as to the\r\n    number and relations of the troops, and the commands of the\r\n    officers having brigades and divisions.... I will not dwell on\r\n    the lost opportunity afforded along the line of northern\r\n    Virginia, but must call your attention to the present condition\r\n    of affairs and probable action of the enemy, if not driven from\r\n    his purpose to advance on the Fredericksburg route....\r\n\r\n    \"Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n    \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of May General Johnston's attention was again called to the\r\norganization of the ten Mississippi regiments into two brigades, and was\r\nreminded that the proposition had been made to him in the previous\r\nautumn, with an expression of my confidence that the regiments would be\r\nmore effective in battle if thus associated.\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to notice the allegation that I was responsible for\r\ninaction by the Army of the Potomac, in the latter part of 1861 and in\r\nthe early part of 1862. After the explosion of the fallacy that I had\r\nprevented the pursuit of the enemy from Manassas in July, 1861, my\r\nassailants have sought to cover their exposure by a change of time and\r\nplace, locating their story at Fairfax Court-House, and dating it in the\r\nautumn of 1861.\r\n\r\nWhen at that time and place I met General Johnston for conference, he\r\ncalled in the two generals next in rank to himself, Beauregard and G. W.\r\nSmith. The question for consideration was, What course should be adopted\r\nfor the future action of the army? and the preliminary inquiry by me was\r\nas to the number of the troops there assembled. To my surprise and\r\ndisappointment, the effective strength was stated to be but little\r\ngreater than when it fought the battle of the 21st of the preceding\r\nJuly. The frequent reënforcements which had been sent to that army in\r\nnowise prepared me for such an announcement. To my inquiry as to what\r\nforce would be required for the contemplated advance into Maryland, the\r\nlowest estimate made by any of them was about twice the number there\r\npresent for duty. How little I was prepared for such a condition of\r\nthings will be realized from the fact that previous suggestions by the\r\ngenerals in regard to a purpose to advance into Maryland had induced me,\r\nwhen I went to that conference, to take with me some drawings made by\r\nthe veteran soldier and engineer, Colonel Crozêt, of the falls of the\r\nPotomac, to show the feasibility of crossing the river at that point.\r\nVery little knowledge of the condition and military resources of the\r\ncountry must have sufficed to show that I had no power to make such an\r\naddition to that army without a total disregard of the safety of other\r\nthreatened positions. It only remained for me to answer that I had not\r\npower to furnish such a number of troops; and, unless the militia\r\nbearing their private arms should be relied on, we could not possibly\r\nfulfill such a requisition until after the receipt of the small-arms\r\nwhich we had early and constantly striven to procure from abroad, and\r\nhad for some time expected.\r\n\r\nAfter I had written the foregoing, and all the succeeding chapters on\r\nkindred subjects, a friend, in October, 1880, furnished me with a copy\r\nof a paper relating to the conference at Fairfax Court-House, which\r\nseems to require notice at my hands.\r\n\r\nTherefore I break the chain of events to insert here some remarks in\r\nregard to it.\r\n\r\nThe paper appears to have been written by General G. W. Smith, and to\r\nhave received the approval of Generals Beauregard and J. E. Johnston,\r\nand to bear date the 31st of January, 1862.\r\n\r\nIt does not agree in some respects with my memory of what occurred, and\r\nis not consistent with itself. It was not necessary that I should learn\r\nin that interview the evil of inactivity. My correspondence of anterior\r\ndate might have shown that I was fully aware of it, and my suggestions\r\nin the interview certainly did not look as if it was necessary to\r\nimpress me with the advantage of action.\r\n\r\nIn one part of the paper it is stated that the reënforcements asked for\r\nwere to be \"seasoned soldiers,\" such as were there present, and who were\r\nsaid to be in the \"finest fighting condition.\" This, if such a\r\nproposition had been made, would have exposed its absurdity, as well as\r\nthe loophole it offered for escape, by subsequently asserting that the\r\ntroops furnished were not up to the proposed standard.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the paper it is stated that there were hope and\r\nexpectation that, before the end of the winter, arms would be introduced\r\ninto the country, and that then we could successfully invade that of the\r\nenemy; but this supply of arms, however abundant, could not furnish\r\n\"seasoned soldiers,\" and the two propositions are therefore\r\ninconsistent. In one place it is written that \"it was felt it might be\r\nbetter to run the risk of almost certain destruction fighting upon the\r\nother side of the Potomac, rather than see the gradual dying out and\r\ndeterioration of this army during a winter,\" etc.; but, when it was\r\nproposed to cross into eastern Maryland on a steamer in our possession\r\nfor a partial campaign, difficulties arose like the lion in the path of\r\nthe sluggard, so that the proposition was postponed and never executed.\r\nIn like manner the other expedition in the Valley of Virginia was\r\nachieved by an officer not of this council, General T. J. Jackson.\r\n\r\nIn one place it is written that the President stated, \"At that time no\r\nreënforcements could be furnished to the army of the character asked\r\nfor.\" In another place he is made to say he could not take any troops\r\nfrom the points named, and, \"without arms from abroad, could not\r\nreënforce that army.\" Here, again, it is clear from the answer that the\r\nproposition had been for such reënforcement as additional arms would\r\nenable him to give. Those arms he expected to receive, barring the\r\ndangers of the sea, and of the enemy, which obstacles alone prevented\r\nthe \"positive assurance that they would be received at all.\"\r\n\r\nIt was, as stated, with deep regret and bitter disappointment that I\r\nfound, notwithstanding our diligent efforts to reënforce this army\r\nbefore and after the battle of Manassas, that its strength had but\r\nlittle increased, and that the arms of absentees and discharged men were\r\nrepresented by only twenty-five hundred on hand. I can not suppose that\r\nGeneral Johnston could have noticed the statement that his request for\r\nconference had set forth the object of it to be to discuss the question\r\nof reënforcement. He would have known that in Richmond, where all the\r\nreturns were to be found, any consideration of reënforcement, by the\r\nwithdrawal of troops from existing garrisons, could best be decided.\r\nVery little experience or a fair amount of modesty without any\r\nexperience would serve to prevent one from announcing his conclusion\r\nthat troops could be withdrawn from a place or places without knowing\r\nhow many were there, and what was the necessity for their presence.\r\n\r\nI was at the conference by request; the confidence felt in those\r\nofficers is shown by the fact that I met them alone, and did not require\r\nany minutes to be made of the meeting. About four months afterward a\r\npaper was prepared to make a record of the conversation; the fact was\r\nconcealed from me, whereas, both for accuracy and frankness, it should\r\nhave been submitted to me, even if there had been nothing due to our\r\nofficial relations. Twenty years after the event, I learned of this\r\nsecret report, by one party, without notice having been given to the\r\nother, of a conversation said to have lasted two hours.\r\n\r\nI have noticed the improbabilities and inconsistencies of the paper,\r\nand, without remark, I submit to honorable men the concealment from me\r\nin which it was prepared, whereby they may judge of the chances for such\r\nco-intelligence as needs must exist between the Executive and the\r\ncommanders of armies to insure attainable success.\r\n\r\nThe position at Fairfax Court-House, though it would answer very well as\r\na point from which to advance, was quite unfavorable for defense; and\r\nwhen I so remarked, the opinion seemed to be that to which the generals\r\nhad previously arrived. It, therefore, only remained to consider what\r\nchange of position should be made in the event of the enemy threatening\r\nsoon to advance. But in the mean time I hoped that something could be\r\ndone by detachments from the army to effect objects less difficult than\r\nan advance against his main force, and particularly indicated the lower\r\npart of Maryland, where a small force was said to be ravaging the\r\ncountry and oppressing our friends. This, I thought, might be feasible\r\nby the establishment of a battery near to Acquia Creek, where the\r\nchannel of the Potomac was said to be so narrow that our guns could\r\nprevent the use of the river by the enemy's boats, and, by employing a\r\nsteamboat lying there, troops enough could be sent over some night to\r\ndefeat that force, and return before any large body could be\r\nconcentrated against them. The effect of the battery and of the\r\nexpedition, it was hoped, would be important in relieving our friends\r\nand securing recruits from those who wished to join us. Previously,\r\nGeneral Johnston's attention had been called to possibilities in the\r\nValley of the Shenandoah, and that these and other like things were not\r\ndone, was surely due to other causes than \"the policy of the\r\nAdministration,\" as will appear by the letters hereto annexed:\r\n\r\n    \"Richmond, Virginia, _August_ 1, 1861.\r\n\r\n    \"General J.

As I there suggested,\r\n    though you may not be able to advance into Maryland and expel\r\n    the enemy, it may be possible to keep up the spirits of your\r\n    troops by expeditions such as that particularly spoken of\r\n    against Sickles's brigade on the lower Potomac, or Banks's\r\n    above.

That vigilant, enterprising, and patriotic soldier,\r\nGeneral T. J. Jackson, whose steadiness under fire at the first battle\r\nof Manassas had procured for him the _sobriquet_ of \"Stonewall,\" was\r\nthen on duty as district commander of the Shenandoah Valley.\r\n\r\nHe was a West Virginian; and, though he had not acquired the fame which\r\nsubsequently shed such luster upon his name, he possessed a\r\nwell-deserved confidence among the people of that region. Ever watchful\r\nand daring in the discharge of any duty, he was intensely anxious to\r\nguard his beloved mountains of Virginia. This, stimulating his devotion\r\nto the general welfare of the Confederacy, induced him to desire to\r\nmarch against the enemy, who had captured Romney. On the 20th of\r\nNovember, 1861, he wrote to the War Department, proposing an expedition\r\nto Romney, in western Virginia. It was decided to adopt his proposition,\r\nendorsed by the commander of the department, and, further to insure\r\nsuccess, though not recommended in the endorsement, his old brigade,\r\nthen in the Army of the Potomac, was selected as a part of the command\r\nwith which he was to make the campaign. General Johnston remonstrated\r\nagainst this transfer, and the correspondence is subjoined for a fuller\r\nunderstanding of the matter:\r\n\r\n    \"Headquarters, Valley District, _November_ 20, 1861.\r\n\r\n    \"Hon. J. P. Benjamin, _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir: I hope you will pardon me for requesting that, at once,\r\n    all the troops under General Loring be ordered to this point.\r\n    Deeply impressed with the importance of absolute secrecy\r\n    respecting military operations, I have made it a point to say\r\n    but little respecting my proposed movements in the event of\r\n    sufficient reënforcements arriving, but, since conversing with\r\n    Lieutenant-Colonel J. L. T. Preston upon his return from General\r\n    Loring, and ascertaining the disposition of the General's\r\n    forces, I venture to respectfully urge that, after concentrating\r\n    all his troops here, an attempt should be made to capture the\r\n    Federal forces at Romney. The attack on Romney would probably\r\n    induce McClellan to believe that the Army of the Potomac had\r\n    been so weakened as to justify him in making an advance on\r\n    Centreville; but, should this not induce him to advance, I do\r\n    not believe anything will during the present winter. Should the\r\n    Army of the Potomac be attacked, I would be at once prepared to\r\n    reënforce it with my present volunteer force, increased by\r\n    General Loring's. After repulsing the enemy at Manassas, let the\r\n    troops that marched on Romney return to the Valley and move\r\n    rapidly westward to the waters of the Monongahela and Little\r\n    Kanawha. Should General Kelley be defeated, and especially\r\n    should he be captured, I believe that, by a judicious\r\n    disposition of the militia, a few cavalry, and a small number of\r\n    field-pieces, no additional forces would be required for some\r\n    time in this district. I deem it of very great importance that\r\n    northwestern Virginia be occupied by Confederate troops this\r\n    winter. At present, it is to be presumed that the enemy are not\r\n    expecting an attack there, and the resources of that region\r\n    necessary for the subsistence of our troops are in greater\r\n    abundance than in almost any other season of the year. Postpone\r\n    the occupation of that section until spring, and we may expect\r\n    to find the enemy prepared for us, and the resources to which I\r\n    have referred greatly exhausted. I know that what I have\r\n    proposed will be an arduous undertaking, and can not be\r\n    accomplished without the sacrifice of much personal comfort, but\r\n    I feel that the troops will be prepared to make this sacrifice\r\n    when animated by the prospects of important results to our cause\r\n    and distinction to themselves. It may be urged, against this\r\n    plan, that the enemy will advance on Staunton or Huntersville. I\r\n    am well satisfied that such a step would but make their\r\n    destruction more certain. Again, it may be said that General\r\n    Floyd will be cut off. To avoid this, if necessary, the General\r\n    has only to fall back toward the Virginia and Tennessee\r\n    Railroad. When northwestern Virginia is occupied in force, the\r\n    Kanawha Valley, unless it be the lower part of it, must be\r\n    evacuated by the Federal forces, or otherwise their safety will\r\n    be endangered by forcing a column across from the Little Kanawha\r\n    between them and the Ohio River. Admitting that the season is\r\n    too far advanced, or that from other causes all can not be\r\n    accomplished that has been named, yet, through the blessing of\r\n    God, who has thus far so wonderfully prospered our cause, much\r\n    more may be expected from General Loring's troops, according to\r\n    this programme, than can be expected from them where they are.\r\n    If you decide to order them here, I trust that, for the purpose\r\n    of saving time, all the infantry, cavalry, and artillery will be\r\n    directed to move immediately upon the reception of the order.\r\n    The enemy, about five thousand strong, have been for some time\r\n    slightly fortifying at Romney, and have completed their\r\n    telegraph from that place to Green Spring Depot. Their forces at\r\n    and near Williamsport are estimated as high as five thousand,\r\n    but as yet I have no reliable information of their strength\r\n    beyond the Potomac. Your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    \"T. J. Jackson, _Major-General, P. A. C. S._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Headquarters, Centreville, _November_ 21, 1861.\r\n\r\n    \"Respectfully forwarded.

If the means of\r\n    driving the enemy from Romney (preventing the reconstruction of\r\n    the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and incursions by marauders\r\n    into the counties of Jefferson, Berkeley, and Morgan) can be\r\n    supplied to General Jackson, and with them those objects,\r\n    accomplished, we shall have reason to be satisfied, so far as\r\n    the Valley district is concerned. The wants of other portions of\r\n    the frontier--Acquia district, for instance--make it\r\n    inexpedient, in my opinion, to transfer to the Valley district\r\n    so large a force as that asked for by Major-General Jackson. It\r\n    seems to me to be now of especial importance to strengthen\r\n    Major-General Holmes, near Acquia Creek.

Johnston, _Manassas, Virginia_.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir: The Secretary of War has this morning laid before me yours\r\n    of the 8th instant. I fully sympathize with your anxiety for the\r\n    Army of the Potomac. If indeed mine be less than yours, it can\r\n    only be so because the south, the west, and the east, presenting\r\n    like cause for solicitude, have in the same manner demanded my\r\n    care. Our correspondence must have assured you that I fully\r\n    concur in your view of the necessity for unity in command, and I\r\n    hope by a statement of the case to convince you that there has\r\n    been no purpose to divide your authority by transferring the\r\n    troops specified in order No. 206 from the center to the left of\r\n    your department. The active campaign in the Greenbrier region\r\n    was considered as closed for the season. There is reason to\r\n    believe that the enemy is moving a portion of his forces from\r\n    that mountain-region toward the Valley of Virginia, and that he\r\n    has sent troops and munitions from the east by the way of the\r\n    Potomac Canal toward the same point. The failure to destroy his\r\n    communications by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and by the\r\n    Potomac Canal has left him in possession of great advantages for\r\n    that operation. General Jackson, for reasons known to you, was\r\n    selected to command the division of the Valley, but we had only\r\n    the militia and one mounted regiment within the district\r\n    assigned to him. The recent activity of the enemy, the capture\r\n    of Romney, etc., required that he should have for prompt service\r\n    a body of Confederate troops to coöperate with the militia of\r\n    that district. You suggest that such force should be drawn from\r\n    the army at the Greenbrier; this was originally considered, and\r\n    abandoned, because they could not reach him in time to\r\n    anticipate the enemy's concentration, and also because General\r\n    Jackson was a stranger to them, and time was wanting for the\r\n    growth of that confidence between the commander and his troops,\r\n    the value of which need not be urged upon you. We could have\r\n    sent to him from this place an equal number of regiments, being\r\n    about double the numerical strength of those specified in the\r\n    order referred to, but they were parts of a brigade now in the\r\n    Army of the Potomac, or were southern troops, and were ignorant\r\n    of the country in which they were to serve, and all of them\r\n    unknown to General Jackson. The troops sent were his old\r\n    brigade, had served in the Valley, and had acquired a reputation\r\n    which would give confidence to the people of that region upon\r\n    whom the General had to rely for his future success. Though the\r\n    troops sent to you are, as you say, 'raw,' they have many able\r\n    officers, and will, I doubt not, be found reliable in the hour\r\n    of danger. Their greater numbers will to you, I hope, more than\r\n    compensate for the experience of those transferred; while, in\r\n    the Valley, the latter, by the moral effect their presence will\r\n    produce, will more than compensate for the inferiority of their\r\n    numbers. I have labored to increase the Army of the Potomac,\r\n    and, so far from proposing a reduction of it, did not intend to\r\n    rest content with an exchange of equivalents. In addition to the\r\n    troops recently sent to you, I expected soon to send further\r\n    reënforcements by withdrawing a part of the army from the\r\n    Greenbrier Mountains. I have looked hopefully forward to the\r\n    time when our army could assume the offensive, and select the\r\n    time and place where battles were to be fought, so that ours\r\n    should be alternations of activity and repose, theirs the heavy\r\n    task of constant watching. When I last visited your\r\n    headquarters, my surprise was expressed at the little increase\r\n    of your effective force above that of the 21st of July last,\r\n    notwithstanding the heavy reënforcements which, in the mean\r\n    time, had been sent to you. Since that visit I have frequently\r\n    heard of the improved health of the troops, of the return of\r\n    many who had been absent sick; and some increase has been made\r\n    by reënforcements. You can, then, imagine my disappointment at\r\n    the information you give, that, on the day before the date of\r\n    your letter, the army at your position was yet no stronger than\r\n    on the 21st of July. I can only repeat what has been said to you\r\n    in our conference at Fairfax Court-House, that we are restricted\r\n    in our capacity to reënforce by the want of arms. Troops to bear\r\n    the few arms you have in store have been ordered forward. Your\r\n    view of the magnitude of the calamity of defeat of the Army of\r\n    the Potomac is entirely concurred in, and every advantage which\r\n    is attainable should be seized to increase the power of your\r\n    present force. I will do what I can to augment its numbers, but\r\n    you must remember that our wants greatly exceed our resources.\r\n\r\n    \"Banks's brigade, we learn, has left the position occupied when\r\n    I last saw you. Sickles is said to be yet in the lower Potomac,\r\n    and, when your means will enable you to reach him, I still hope\r\n    he may be crushed.\r\n\r\n    \"I will show this reply to the Secretary of War, and hope there\r\n    will be no misunderstanding between you in future. The success\r\n    of the army requires harmonious coöperation.\r\n\r\n    \"Very respectfully, etc.,\r\n\r\n    \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\nAfter General Jackson commenced his march, the cold became unexpectedly\r\nsevere, and, as he ascended into the mountainous region, the slopes were\r\ncovered with ice, which impeded his progress, the more because his\r\nhorses were smooth-shod; but his tenacity of purpose, fidelity, and\r\ndaring, too well known to need commendation, triumphed over every\r\nobstacle, and he attained his object, drove the enemy from Romney and\r\nits surroundings, took possession of the place, and prevented the\r\nthreatened concentration. Having accomplished this purpose, and being\r\nassured that the enemy had abandoned that section of country, he\r\nreturned with his old brigade to the Valley of the Shenandoah, leaving\r\nthe balance of his command at Romney. General Loring, the senior officer\r\nthere present, and many others of the command so left, appealed to the\r\nWar Department to be withdrawn. Their arguments were, as well as I\r\nremember, these: that the troops, being from the South, were\r\nunaccustomed to, and unprepared for, the rigors of a mountain winter;\r\nthat they were strangers to the people of that section; that the\r\nposition had no military strength, and, at the approach of spring, would\r\nbe accessible to the enemy by roads leading from various quarters.\r\n\r\nAfter some preliminary action, an order was issued from the War Office\r\ndirecting the troops to retire to the Valley. As that order has been the\r\nsubject of no little complaint, both by civil and military\r\nfunctionaries, my letter to the General commanding the department, in\r\nexplanation of the act of the Secretary of War, is hereto annexed:\r\n\r\n    \"Richmond, Virginia, _February_ 14, 1862.\r\n\r\n    \"General J. E. Johnston, _commanding Department of Northern\r\n    Virginia, Centreville, Virginia_.\r\n\r\n    \"General: I have received your letter of the 5th instant. While\r\n    I admit the propriety in all cases of transmitting orders\r\n    through you to those under your command, it is not surprising\r\n    that the Secretary of War should, in a case requiring prompt\r\n    action, have departed from this, the usual method, in view of\r\n    the fact that he had failed more than once in having his\r\n    instructions carried out when forwarded to you in the proper\r\n    manner. You will remember that you were directed, on account of\r\n    the painful reports received at the War Department in relation\r\n    to the command at Romney, to repair to that place, and, after\r\n    the needful examination, to give the orders proper in the case.\r\n    You sent your adjutant- (inspector?) general, and I am informed\r\n    that he went no farther than Winchester, to which point the\r\n    commander of the expedition had withdrawn; leaving the troops,\r\n    for whom anxiety had been excited, at Romney. Had you given your\r\n    personal attention to the case, you must be assured that the\r\n    confidence reposed in you would have prevented the Secretary\r\n    from taking any action before your report had been received. In\r\n    the absence of such security, he was further moved by what was\r\n    deemed reliable information, that a large force of the enemy was\r\n    concentrating to capture the troops at Romney, and by official\r\n    report that place had no natural strength and little strategic\r\n    importance. To insure concert of action in the defense of our\r\n    Potomac frontier, it was thought best to place all the forces\r\n    for this object under one command. The reasons which originally\r\n    induced the adding of the Valley district to your department\r\n    exist in full force at present, and I can not, therefore, agree\r\n    to its separation from your command.\r\n\r\n    \"I will visit the Army of the Potomac as soon as other\r\n    engagements will permit, although I can not realize your\r\n    complimentary assurance that great good to the army will result\r\n    from it; nor can I anticipate the precise time when it will be\r\n    practicable to leave my duties here.\r\n\r\n    \"Very respectfully and truly yours,\r\n\r\n    \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\nTo complaints by General Johnston that the discipline of his army was\r\ninterfered with by irregular action of the Secretary of War, and its\r\nnumerical strength diminished by furloughs granted directly by the War\r\nDepartment, I replied, after making inquiry at the War Office, by a\r\nletter, a copy of which is hereto annexed:\r\n\r\n    \"Richmond, Virginia, _March_ 4, 1862.\r\n\r\n    \"General J. E. Johnston, _Centreville, Virginia_.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Sir: Yours of the 1st instant received prompt attention,\r\n    and I am led to the conclusion that some imposition has been\r\n    practiced upon you. The Secretary of War informs me that he has\r\n    not granted leaves of absence or furloughs to soldiers of your\r\n    command for a month past, and then only to divert the current\r\n    which threatened by legislation to destroy your army by a\r\n    wholesale system of furloughs. Those which you inform me are\r\n    daily received must be spurious. The authority to reënlist and\r\n    change from infantry to artillery, the Secretary informs me, has\r\n    been given but in four cases--three on the recommendation of\r\n    General Beauregard, and specially explained to you some time\r\n    since; the remaining case was that of a company from Wheeling,\r\n    which was regarded as an exceptional one. I wish, therefore,\r\n    that you would send to the Adjutant-General the cases of recent\r\n    date in which the discipline of your troops has been interfered\r\n    with in the two methods stated, so that an inquiry may be made\r\n    into the origin of the papers presented. The law in relation to\r\n    reënlistment provides for reorganization, and was under the\r\n    policy of electing the officers.\r\n\r\n    \"The concession to army opinions was limited to the promotion by\r\n    seniority after the organization of the companies and regiments\r\n    had been completed. The reorganization was not to occur before\r\n    the expiration of the present term. A subsequent law provides\r\n    for filling up the twelve months' companies by recruits for the\r\n    war, but the organization ceases with the term of the twelve\r\n    months' men. Be assured of readiness to protect your proper\r\n    authority, and I do but justice to the Secretary of War in\r\n    saying that he can not desire to interfere with the discipline\r\n    and organization of your troops. He has complained that his\r\n    orders are not executed, and I regret that he was able to\r\n    present to me so many instances to justify that complaint, which\r\n    were in no wise the invasion of your prerogative as a commander\r\n    in the field.\r\n\r\n    \"You can command my attention at all times to any matter\r\n    connected with your duties, and I hope that full co-intelligence\r\n    will secure full satisfaction. Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n    \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\nA fortnight after this letter, I received from General Johnston notice\r\nthat his position was considered unsafe. Many of his letters to me have\r\nbeen lost, and I have thus far not been able to find the one giving the\r\nnotice referred to, but the reply which is annexed clearly indicates the\r\nsubstance of the letter which was answered.\r\n\r\n    \"Richmond, Virginia, _February_ 28, 1862.\r\n\r\n    \"General J. E. Johnston: ... Your opinion that your position may\r\n    be turned whenever the enemy chooses to advance, and that he\r\n    will be ready to take the field before yourself, clearly\r\n    indicates prompt effort to disencumber yourself of everything\r\n    which would interfere with your rapid movement when necessary,\r\n    and such thorough examination of the country in your rear as\r\n    would give you exact knowledge of its roads and general\r\n    topography, and enable you to select a line of greater natural\r\n    advantages than that now occupied by your forces.\r\n\r\n    \"The heavy guns at Manassas and Evansport, needed elsewhere, and\r\n    reported to be useless in their present position, would\r\n    necessarily be abandoned in any hasty retreat.

Those can not be\r\n    determined until you have furnished definite information as to\r\n    your plans, especially the line to which you would remove in the\r\n    contingency of retiring. The Commissary-General had previously\r\n    stopped further shipments to your army, and given satisfactory\r\n    reasons for the establishment at Thoroughfare.[191] ...\r\n\r\n    \"I need not urge on your consideration the value to our country\r\n    of arms and munitions of war: you know the difficulty with which\r\n    we have obtained our small supply; that, to furnish heavy\r\n    artillery to the advanced posts, we have exhausted the supplies\r\n    here which were designed for the armament of the city defenses.\r\n    Whatever can be, should be done to avoid the loss of these\r\n    guns....\r\n\r\n    \"As has been my custom, I have only sought to present general\r\n    purposes and views.

At such an hour, the wisdom of\r\n    the trained and the steadiness of the brave possess a double\r\n    value.

I was fully impressed with\r\n    the difficulties which you presented when discussing the subject\r\n    of a change of position. To preserve the efficiency of your\r\n    army, you will, of course, avoid all needless exposure; and,\r\n    when your army has been relieved of all useless encumbrance, you\r\n    can have no occasion to move it while the roads and the weather\r\n    are such as would involve serious suffering, because the same\r\n    reasons must restrain the operations of the enemy....\r\n\r\n    \"Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n    \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\nAt the conference at Fairfax Court-House, heretofore referred to, I was\r\nsadly disappointed to find that the strength of that army had been\r\nlittle increased, notwithstanding the reënforcements sent to it since\r\nthe 21st of July, and that to make an advance the generals required an\r\nadditional force, which it was utterly impracticable for me to supply.\r\nSoon thereafter the army withdrew to Centreville, a better position for\r\ndefense but not for attack, and thereby suggestive of the abandonment of\r\nan intention to advance. The subsequent correspondence with General\r\nJohnston during the winter expressed an expectation that the enemy would\r\nresume the offensive, and that the position then held was geographically\r\nunfavorable. There was a general apprehension at Richmond that the\r\nnorthern frontier of Virginia would be abandoned, and a corresponding\r\nearnestness was exhibited to raise the requisite force to enable our\r\narmy to take the offensive. On the 10th of March I telegraphed to\r\nGeneral Johnston: \"Further assurance given to me this day that you shall\r\nbe promptly and adequately reënforced, so as to enable you to maintain\r\nyour position, and resume first policy when the roads will permit.\" The\r\nfirst policy was to carry the war beyond our own border.\r\n\r\nFive days thereafter, I received notice that our army was in retreat,\r\nand replied as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Richmond, Virginia, _March_ 15, 1862.\r\n\r\n    \"General J. E. Johnston, _Headquarters Army of the Potomac_.\r\n\r\n    \"General: I have received your letter of the 13th instant,\r\n    giving the first official account I have received of the\r\n    retrograde movement of your army.\r\n\r\n    \"Your letter would lead me to infer that others had been sent to\r\n    apprise me of your plans and movements. If so, they have not\r\n    reached me; and, before the receipt of yours of the 13th, I was\r\n    as much in the dark as to your purposes, condition, and\r\n    necessities as at the time of our conversation on the subject\r\n    about a month since.\r\n\r\n    \"It is true I have had many and alarming reports of great\r\n    destruction of ammunition, camp-equipage, and provisions,\r\n    indicating precipitate retreat; but, having heard of no cause\r\n    for such a sudden movement, I was at a loss to believe it.\r\n\r\n    \"I have not the requisite topographical knowledge for the\r\n    selection of your new position. I had intended that you should\r\n    determine that question; and for this purpose a corps of\r\n    engineers was furnished to make a careful examination of the\r\n    country to aid you in your decision.\r\n\r\n    \"The question of throwing troops into Richmond is contingent\r\n    upon reverses in the West and Southeast. The immediate necessity\r\n    for such a movement is not anticipated.\r\n\r\n    \"Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n    \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day I sent the following telegram:\r\n\r\n    \"Richmond, Virginia, _March_ 15, 1862.\r\n\r\n    \"General J. E. Johnston, _Culpepper Court-House, Virginia_.\r\n\r\n    \"Your letter of the 13th received this day, being the first\r\n    information of your retrograde movement. I have no report of\r\n    your reconnaissance, and can suggest nothing as to the position\r\n    you should take except it should be as far in advance as\r\n    consistent with your safety.\r\n\r\n    \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\nTo further inquiry from General Johnston as to where he should take\r\nposition, I replied that I would go to his headquarters in the field,\r\nand found him on the south bank of the river, to which he had retired,\r\nin a position possessing great natural advantages. An elevated bank\r\ncommanded the north side of the river, overlooking the bridge, and an\r\nopen field beyond it, across which the enemy must pass to reach the\r\nbridge, which, if left standing, was an invitation to seek that\r\ncrossing. Upon inquiring whether the south bank of the river continued\r\nto command the other side down to Fredericksburg, General Johnston\r\nanswered that he did not know; that he had not been at Fredericksburg\r\nsince he passed there in a stage on his way to West Point, when he was\r\nfirst appointed a cadet. I then proposed that we should go to\r\nFredericksburg, to inform ourselves upon that point. On arriving at\r\nFredericksburg, a reconnaissance soon manifested that the hills on the\r\nopposite side commanded the town and adjacent river-bank, and therefore\r\nFredericksburg could only be defended by an army occupying the opposite\r\nhills, for which our force was inadequate. In returning to the house of\r\nMr. Barton, where I was a guest, I found a number of ladies had\r\nassembled there to welcome me, and who, with anxiety, inquired as to the\r\nresult of our reconnaissance. Upon learning that the town was not\r\nconsidered defensible against an enemy occupying the heights on the\r\nother side, and that our force was not sufficient to hold those heights\r\nagainst such an attack as might be anticipated, the general answer was,\r\nwith a self-sacrificing patriotism too much admired to be forgotten, \"If\r\nthe good of our cause requires the defense of the town to be abandoned,\r\nlet it be done.\" The purposes of the enemy were then unknown to us. If\r\nGeneral Johnston's expectation of a hostile advance in great force\r\nshould be realized, our course must depend partly upon receiving the\r\nreënforcement we had reason to expect from promises previously given and\r\nrenewed, as was announced to General Johnston in my telegram of 10th of\r\nMarch, 1862, in these words:\r\n\r\n    \"Further assurance given to me this day that you shall be\r\n    promptly and adequately reënforced, so as to enable you to\r\n    maintain your position, and resume first policy when the roads\r\n    will permit.\"\r\n\r\nNo immediate decision could therefore be made, and I returned to\r\nRichmond, to wait the further development of the enemy's plans, and to\r\nprepare as best we might to counteract them.\r\n\r\nThe feeling heretofore noticed as arousing in Virginia a determination\r\nto resist the abandonment of her northern frontier, and which caused the\r\nassurance of reënforcements, bore fruit in the addition of about thirty\r\nthousand men, by a draft made by the Governor of the State. These, it is\r\ntrue, were not the disciplined, seasoned troops which were asked for by\r\nthe generals in the conference at Fairfax Court-House, but they were of\r\nsuch men as often during the war won battles for the Confederacy. The\r\ndevelopment of the enemy's plans, for which we had to wait, proved that,\r\ninstead of advancing in force against our position at Centreville, he\r\nhad, before the retreat of our army commenced, decided to move down the\r\nPotomac for a campaign against Richmond, from the Peninsula as a base.\r\nThe conflagration at Centreville gave notice of its evacuation, and an\r\nadvance was made as far as Manassas, but, as appears by General\r\nMcClellan's report, with no more important design than to attack our\r\nrear guard, if it should be encountered. In the report on the conduct of\r\nthe war by a committee of the United States Congress, evidence is found\r\nof much vacillation before the conclusion was finally reached of\r\nabandoning the idea of a direct advance upon Richmond for that of\r\nconcentrating their army at the mouth of the Chesapeake. Whatever doubt\r\nor apprehension continued to exist about uncovering the city of\r\nWashington by removing their main army from before it, was of course\r\ndispelled by the retreat of our army, and the burning of bridges behind\r\nit. In this last-mentioned fact, General McClellan says he found the\r\nstrongest reason to believe that there was no immediate danger of our\r\narmy returning.\r\n\r\nThere was an apparent advantage to the enemy in the new base for his\r\noperations which was sufficiently illustrated by the events of the last\r\nyear of the war. Had we possessed an army as large as the enemy\r\nsupposed, it would have been possible for us at the same time to check\r\nhis advance from the East and to march against his capital, with fair\r\nprospect of capturing it, before the army he had sent against Yorktown\r\ncould have been brought back for the defense of Washington. On this as\r\non other occasions he greatly magnified the force we possessed, and on\r\nthis as on other occasions it required the concentration of our troops\r\nsuccessfully to resist a detachment of his. Accepting as a necessity\r\nthe withdrawal of the main portion of our army from northern Virginia to\r\nmeet the invasion from the seaboard, it was regretted that earlier and\r\nmore effective means were not employed for the mobilization of the army,\r\na desirable measure in either contingency of advance or retreat, or at\r\nthe least that the withdrawal was not so deliberate as to secure the\r\nremoval of our ordnance, subsistence, and quartermasters' stores, which\r\nhad been collected on the line occupied in 1861 and the early part of\r\n1862.\r\n\r\nA distinguished officer of our army, who has since the war made valuable\r\ncontributions to the history of its operations--especially valuable as\r\nwell for their accuracy as for their freedom from personal or partisan\r\nbias--writes thus of the retreat from Centreville:\r\n\r\n    \"A very large amount of stores and provisions had been abandoned\r\n    for want of transportation, and among the stores was a very\r\n    large quantity of clothing, blankets etc., which had been\r\n    provided by the States south of Virginia for their own troops.\r\n    The pile of trunks along the railroad was appalling to behold.\r\n    All these stores, clothing, trunks, etc., were consigned to the\r\n    flames by a portion of our cavalry left to carry out the work of\r\n    their destruction. The loss of stores at this point and at White\r\n    Plains on the Manassas Gap Railroad, where a large amount of\r\n    meat had been salted and stored, was a very serious one to us,\r\n    and embarrassed us for the remainder of the war, as it put us at\r\n    once on a running stock.\"\r\n\r\nThe same officer--and the value of his opinion will be recognized by all\r\nwho know him, wherefore I give his name, General J. A. Early--in a\r\ncommunication subsequent to that from which I have just quoted, writes,\r\nin regard to the loss of supplies:\r\n\r\n    \"I believe that all might have been carried off from Manassas if\r\n    the railroads had been energetically operated. The rolling-stock\r\n    of the Orange and Alexandria, Manassas Gap, and Virginia Central\r\n    Railroads ought to have been sufficient for the purpose of\r\n    removing everything in the two weeks allowed, if properly used.\"\r\n\r\nThe enemy's plans, the development of which, as has been already stated,\r\nwas necessary for the determination of our own movements, were soon\r\nthereafter found to be the invasion of Virginia from the seaboard, and\r\nthe principal portion of our army was consequently ordered to the\r\nPeninsula, between the York River and the James. Thus the northern\r\nfrontier of Virginia, which, in the first year of the war, had been the\r\nmain field of skirmishes, combats, and battles, of advance and retreat,\r\nand the occupation and evacuation of fortified positions, ceased for a\r\ntime to tremble beneath the tread of contending armies.\r\n\r\nTo the foregoing narration of events immediately connected with the\r\nefforts of the Confederate Government to maintain its existence at home,\r\nmay here be properly added an incident bearing on its foreign relations\r\nin the first year of the war.\r\n\r\nOur efforts for the recognition of the Confederate States by the\r\nEuropean powers, in 1861, served to make us better known abroad, to\r\nawaken a kindly feeling in our favor, and cause a respectful regard for\r\nthe effort we were making to maintain the independence of the States\r\nwhich Great Britain had recognized, and her people knew to be our\r\nbirthright.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of November, 1861, an outrage was perpetrated by an armed\r\nvessel of the United States, in the forcible detention, on the\r\nhigh-seas, of a British mail steamer, making one of her regular trips\r\nfrom one British port to another, and the seizure, on that unarmed\r\nvessel, of our Commissioners, Mason and Slidell, who with their\r\nsecretaries were bound for Europe on diplomatic service. The seizure was\r\nmade by an armed force against the protest of the Captain of the vessel,\r\nand of Commander Williams, R.N., the latter speaking as the\r\nrepresentative of her Majesty's Government. The Commissioners only\r\nyielded when force, which they could not resist, was used to remove them\r\nfrom the mail-steamer, and convey them to the United States vessel of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThis outrage was the more marked because the United States had been\r\nforemost in resisting the right of \"visit and search,\" and had made it\r\nthe cause of the War of 1812 with Great Britain.\r\n\r\nWhen intelligence of the event was received in England, it excited the\r\ngreatest indignation among the people; and her Majesty's Government, by\r\nnaval and other preparations, unmistakably exhibited the purpose to\r\nredress the wrong.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners and their secretaries had been transported to the\r\nharbor of Boston, and imprisoned in its main fortress.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic correspondence resulted from this event. The British\r\nGovernment demanded the immediate and unconditional release of the\r\nCommissioners, \"in order that they may again be placed under British\r\nprotection, and a suitable apology for the aggression which has been\r\ncommitted.\"\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Captain Wilkes, commander of the vessel which had made\r\nthe visit and search of the Trent, returned to the United States and was\r\nreceived with general plaudit, both by the people and the Government.\r\nThe House of Representatives passed a vote of thanks, an honor not\r\nheretofore bestowed except for some deed deserving well of the country.\r\nIn the midst of all this exultation at the seizure of our Commissioners\r\non board of a British merchant-ship, came the indignant and stern demand\r\nfor the restoration of those Commissioners to the British protection\r\nfrom which they had been taken, and an apology for the aggression. It\r\nwas little to be expected, after such explicit commendation of the act,\r\nthat the United States Government would accede to the demand; and\r\ntherefore the War and Navy Departments of the British Government made\r\nactive and extensive provision to enforce it. The haughty temper\r\ndisplayed toward four gentlemen arrested on an unarmed ship subsided in\r\nview of a demand to be enforced by the army and navy of Great Britain,\r\nand the United States Secretary of State, after a wordy and ingenious\r\nreply to the Minister of Great Britain at Washington City, wrote: \"The\r\nfour persons in question are now held in military custody at Fort\r\nWarren, in the State of Massachusetts. They will be cheerfully\r\nliberated. Your lordship will please indicate a time and place for\r\nreceiving them.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a time when the Government and the people of the United States\r\nwould not have sanctioned such aggression on the right of friendly ships\r\nto pass unquestioned on the high way of nations, and the right of a\r\nneutral flag to protect everything not contraband of war; but that was a\r\ntime when arrogance and duplicity had not led them into false positions,\r\nand when the roar of the British lion could not make Americans retract\r\nwhat they had deliberately avowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 191: Thoroughfare Gap was the point at which the\r\nCommissary-General had placed a meat-packing establishment]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n    Supply of Arms at the Beginning of the War; of Powder; of\r\n    Batteries; of other Articles.--Contents of Arsenals.--Other\r\n    Stores, Mills, etc.--First Efforts to obtain Powder, Niter, and\r\n    Sulphur.--Construction of Mills commenced.--Efforts to supply\r\n    Arms, Machinery, Field-Artillery, Ammunition, Equipment, and\r\n    Saltpeter.--Results in 1862.--Government Powder-Mills; how\r\n    organized.--Success.--Efforts to obtain Lead.--\r\n    Smelting-Works.--Troops, how armed.--Winter of 1862.--\r\n    Supplies.--Niter and Mining Bureau.--Equipment of First\r\n    Armies.--Receipts by Blockade-Runners.--Arsenal at\r\n    Richmond.--Armories at Richmond and Fayetteville.--A Central\r\n    Laboratory built at Macon.--Statement of General Gorgas.--\r\n    Northern Charge against General Floyd answered.--Charge of\r\n    Slowness against the President answered.--Quantities of Arms\r\n    purchased that could not be shipped in 1861.--Letter of Mr.\r\n    Huse.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war the arms within the limits of the\r\nConfederacy were distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n                                          Rifles.     Muskets.\r\nAt Richmond (State)               about    4,000\r\nFayetteville, North Carolina        \"      2,000      25,000\r\nCharleston, South Carolina          \"      2,000      20,000\r\nAugusta, Georgia                    \"      3,000      28,000\r\nMount Vernon, Alabama               \"      2,000      20,000\r\nBaton Rouge, Louisiana              \"      2,000      27,000\r\n                                         ---------  ----------\r\n             Total                        15,000     120,000\r\n\r\nThere were at Richmond about sixty thousand old flint-muskets, and at\r\nBaton Rouge about ten thousand old Hall's rifles and carbines. At Little\r\nRock, Arkansas, there were a few thousand stands, and a few at the Texas\r\nArsenal, increasing the aggregate of serviceable arms to about one\r\nhundred and forty-three thousand. Add to these the arms owned by the\r\nseveral States and by military organizations, and it would make a total\r\nof one hundred and fifty thousand for the use of the armies of the\r\nConfederacy. The rifles were of the caliber .54, known as Mississippi\r\nrifles, except those at Richmond taken from Harper's Ferry, which were\r\nof the new-model caliber .58; the muskets were the old flint lock,\r\ncaliber .69, altered to percussion. There were a few boxes of sabers at\r\neach arsenal, and some short artillery-swords. A few hundred\r\nholster-pistols were scattered about. There were no revolvers.\r\n\r\nThere was before the war little powder or ammunition of any kind stored\r\nin the Southern States, and this was a relic of the war with Mexico. It\r\nis doubtful if there were a million of rounds of small-arms cartridges.\r\nThe chief store of powder was that captured at Norfolk; there was,\r\nbesides, a small quantity at each of the Southern arsenals, in all sixty\r\nthousand pounds, chiefly old cannon-powder. The percussion-caps did not\r\nexceed one quarter of a million, and there was no lead on hand. There\r\nwere no batteries of serviceable field-artillery at the arsenals, but a\r\nfew old iron guns mounted on Gribeauval carriages fabricated about 1812.\r\nThe States and the volunteer companies did, however, possess some\r\nserviceable batteries. But there were neither harness, saddles, bridles,\r\nblankets, nor other artillery or cavalry equipments.\r\n\r\nTo furnish one hundred and fifty thousand men, on both sides of the\r\nMississippi, in May, 1861, there were no infantry accoutrements, no\r\ncavalry arms or equipments, no artillery and, above all, no ammunition;\r\nnothing save arms, and these almost wholly the old pattern smooth-bore\r\nmuskets, altered to percussion from flint locks.\r\n\r\nWithin the limits of the Confederate States the arsenals had been used\r\nonly as depots, and no one of them, except that at Fayetteville, North\r\nCarolina, had a single machine above the grade of a foot-lathe. Except\r\nat Harper's Ferry Armory, all the work of preparation of material had\r\nbeen carried on at the North; not an arm, not a gun, not a gun-carriage,\r\nand, except during the Mexican War, scarcely a round of ammunition, had\r\nfor fifty years been prepared in the Confederate States. There were\r\nconsequently no workmen, or very few, skilled in these arts. Powder,\r\nsave perhaps for blasting, had not been made at the South. No saltpeter\r\nwas in store at any Southern point; it was stored wholly at the North.\r\nThere were no worked mines of lead except in Virginia, and the situation\r\nof those made them a precarious dependence. The only cannon-foundry\r\nexisting was at Richmond. Copper, so necessary for field-artillery and\r\nfor percussion-caps, was just being obtained in East Tennessee. There\r\nwas no rolling-mill for bar-iron south of Richmond, and but few\r\nblast-furnaces and these, with trifling exceptions, were in the border\r\nStates of Virginia and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe first efforts made to obtain powder were by orders sent to the\r\nNorth, which had been early done both by the Confederate Government and\r\nby some of the States. These were being rapidly filled when the attack\r\nwas made on Fort Sumter. The shipments then ceased. Niter was\r\ncontemporaneously sought for in north Alabama and Tennessee. Between\r\nfour and five hundred tons of sulphur were obtained in New Orleans, at\r\nwhich place it had been imported for use in the manufacture of sugar.\r\nPreparations for the construction of a large powder-mill were promptly\r\ncommenced by the Government, and two small, private mills in East\r\nTennessee were supervised and improved. On June 1, 1861, there was\r\nprobably two hundred and fifty thousand pounds only, chiefly of\r\ncannon-powder, and about as much niter, which had been imported by\r\nGeorgia. There were the two powder-mills above mentioned, but we had no\r\nexperience in making powder, or in extracting niter from natural\r\ndeposits, or in obtaining it by artificial beds.\r\n\r\nFor the supply of arms an agent was sent to Europe, who made contracts\r\nto the extent of nearly half a million dollars. Some small-arms had been\r\nobtained from the North, and also important machinery. The machinery at\r\nHarper's Ferry Armory had been saved from the flames by the heroic\r\nconduct of the operatives, headed by Mr. Armistead M. Ball, the master\r\narmorer. Of the machinery so saved, that for making rifle-muskets was\r\ntransported to Richmond, and that for rifles with sword-bayonets to\r\nFayetteville, North Carolina. In addition to the injuries suffered by\r\nthe machinery, the lack of skilled workmen caused much embarrassment. In\r\nthe mean time the manufacture of small-arms was undertaken at New\r\nOrleans and prosecuted with energy, though with limited success.\r\n\r\nIn field-artillery the manufacture was confined almost entirely to the\r\nTredegar Works in Richmond. Some castings were made in New Orleans, and\r\nattention was turned to the manufacture of field and siege artillery at\r\nNashville. A small foundry at Rome, Georgia, was induced to undertake\r\nthe casting of the three-inch iron rifle, but the progress was very\r\nslow. The State of Virginia possessed a number of old four-pounder iron\r\nguns which were reamed out to get a good bore, and rifled with three\r\ngrooves, after the manner of Parrott. The army at Harper's Ferry and\r\nthat at Manassas were supplied with old batteries of six-pounder guns\r\nand twelve-pounder howitzers. A few Parrott guns, purchased by the State\r\nof Virginia, were with General Magruder at Big Bethel.\r\n\r\nFor the ammunition and equipment required for the infantry and\r\nartillery, a good laboratory and workshop had been established at\r\nRichmond. The arsenals were making preparations for furnishing\r\nammunition and knapsacks; but generally, what little was done in this\r\nregard was for local purposes. Such was the general condition of\r\nordnance and ordnance stores in May, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe progress of development, however, was steady. A refinery of\r\nsaltpeter was established near Nashville during the summer, which\r\nreceived the niter from its vicinity, and from the caves in East and\r\nMiddle Tennessee. Some inferior powder was made at two small mills in\r\nSouth Carolina. North Carolina established a mill near Raleigh; and a\r\nstamping-mill was put up near New Orleans, and powder made there before\r\nthe fall of the city. Small quantities were also received through the\r\nblockade. It was estimated that on January 1, 1862, there were fifteen\r\nhundred seacoast-guns of various caliber in position from Evansport, on\r\nthe Potomac, to Fort Brown, on the Rio Grande. If their caliber was\r\naveraged at thirty-two pounder, and the charge at five pounds, it would,\r\nat forty rounds per gun, require six hundred thousand pounds of powder\r\nfor them. The field-artillery--say three hundred guns, with two hundred\r\nrounds to the piece--would require one hundred and twenty-five thousand\r\npounds; and the small-arm cartridges--say ten million--would consume one\r\nhundred and twenty-five thousand pounds more, making in all eight\r\nhundred and fifty thousand pounds. Deducting two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand pounds, supposed to be on hand in various shapes, and the\r\nincrement is six hundred thousand pounds for the year 1861. Of this,\r\nperhaps two hundred thousand pounds had been made at the Tennessee and\r\nother mills, leaving four hundred thousand pounds to be supplied through\r\nthe blockade, or before the beginning of hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe liability of powder to deteriorate in damp atmospheres results from\r\nthe impurity of the niter used in its manufacture, and this it is not\r\npossible to detect by any of the usual tests. Security, therefore, in\r\nthe purchase, depends on the reliability of the maker. To us, who had to\r\nrely on foreign products and the open market, this was equivalent to no\r\nsecurity at all. It was, therefore, as well for this reason as because\r\nof the precariousness of thus obtaining the requisite supply, necessary\r\nthat we should establish a Government powder-mill. It was our good\r\nfortune to have a valuable man whose military education and scientific\r\nknowledge had been supplemented by practical experience in a large\r\nmanufactory of machinery. He, General G. W. Rains, was at the time\r\nresident in the State of New York; but, when his native State, North\r\nCarolina, seceded from the Union and joined the Confederacy, true to the\r\nhighest instincts of patriotism, he returned to the land of his birth,\r\nand only asked where he could be most useful. The expectations which his\r\nreputation justified, caused him to be assigned to the task of making a\r\ngreat powder-mill, which should alike furnish an adequate supply, and\r\ngive assurance of its possessing all the requisite qualities. This\r\nproblem, which, under the existing circumstances, seemed barely\r\npossible, was fully solved. Not only was powder made of every variety of\r\ngrain and exact uniformity in each, but the niter was so absolutely\r\npurified that there was no danger of its deterioration in service. Had\r\nAdmiral Semmes been supplied with such powder, it is demonstrated, by\r\nthe facts which have since been established, that the engagement between\r\nthe Alabama and the Kearsarge would have resulted in a victory for the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nThese Government powder-mills were located at Augusta, Georgia, and\r\nsatisfactory progress was made in the construction during the year. All\r\nthe machinery, including the very heavy rollers, was made in the\r\nConfederate States. Contracts were made abroad for the delivery of niter\r\nthrough the blockade; and, for obtaining it immediately, we resorted to\r\ncaves, tobacco-houses, cellars, etc. The amount delivered from Tennessee\r\nwas the largest item in the year's supply, but the whole was quite\r\ninadequate to existing and prospective needs.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of lead was mainly met by the Virginia lead-mines at\r\nWytheville, the yield from which was from sixty to eighty thousand\r\npounds per month. Lead was also collected by agents in considerable\r\nquantities throughout the country, and the battle-field of Manassas was\r\nclosely gleaned, from which much lead was collected. A laboratory for\r\nthe smelting of other ores was constructed at Petersburg, Virginia, and\r\nwas in operation before midsummer of 1862.\r\n\r\nBy the close of 1861, eight arsenals and four depots had been supplied\r\nwith materials and machinery, so as to be efficient in producing the\r\nvarious munitions and equipments, the want of which had caused early\r\nembarrassment. Thus a good deal had been done to produce the needed\r\nmaterial of war, and to refute the croakers who found in our poverty\r\napplication for the maxim, \"_Ex nihilo nihil fit._\"\r\n\r\nThe troops were, however, still very poorly armed and equipped. The old\r\nsmooth-bore musket was the principal weapon of the infantry; the\r\nartillery had mostly the six-pounder gun and the twelve-pounder\r\nhowitzer; and the cavalry were armed with such various weapons as they\r\ncould get--sabers, horse-pistols, revolvers, Sharp's carbines,\r\nmusketoons, short Enfield rifles, Holt's carbines, muskets cut off, etc.\r\nEquipments were in many cases made of stout cotton domestic, stitched in\r\ntriple folds and covered with paint or rubber varnish. But, poor as were\r\nthe arms, enough of them, such as they were, could not be obtained to\r\narm the troops pressing forward to defend their homes and their\r\npolitical rights.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1861, arms purchased abroad began to come in, and a good\r\nmany Enfield rifles were in the hands of the troops at the battle of\r\nShiloh. The winter of 1862 was the period when our ordnance deficiencies\r\nwere most keenly felt. Powder was called for on every hand; and the\r\nequipments most needed were those we were least able to supply. The\r\nabandonment of the line of the Potomac and the upper Mississippi from\r\nColumbus to Memphis did somewhat, however, the pressure for heavy\r\nartillery; and, after the fall of 1862, when the powder-mills at Augusta\r\nhad got into full operation, there was no further inability to meet all\r\nrequisitions for ammunition. To provide the iron needed for cannon and\r\nprojectiles, it had been necessary to stimulate by contracts the mining\r\nand smelting of its ores.\r\n\r\nBut it was obviously beyond the power of even the great administrative\r\ncapacity of the chief of ordnance, General J. Gorgas, to whose monograph\r\nI am indebted for these details, to add, to his already burdensome\r\nlabors, the numerous and increasing cares of obtaining the material from\r\nwhich ammunition, arms, and equipments were to be manufactured. On his\r\nrecommendation a niter and mining bureau was organized, and Colonel St.\r\nJohn, who had been hitherto assigned to duty in connection with\r\nprocuring supplies of niter and iron, was appointed to be chief of this\r\nbureau. A large, difficult, and most important field of operations was\r\nthus assigned to him, and well did he fulfill its requirements. To his\r\nrecent experience was added scientific knowledge, and to both, untiring,\r\nsystematic industry, and his heart's thorough devotion to the cause he\r\nserved. The tree is known by its fruit, and he may confidently point to\r\nresults as the evidence on which he is willing to stand for judgment.\r\nBriefly, they will be noticed.\r\n\r\nNiter was to be obtained from caves and other like sources, and by the\r\nformation of niter-beds, some of which had previously been begun at\r\nRichmond. These beds were located at Columbia, South Carolina,\r\nCharleston, Savannah, Augusta, Mobile, Selma, and various other points.\r\nAt the close of 1864 there were two million eight hundred thousand feet\r\nof earth collected, and in various stages of nitrification, of which a\r\nlarge proportion was presumed to yield one and a half pound of niter per\r\nfoot of earth. The whole country was laid off into districts, each of\r\nwhich was under the charge of an officer, who obtained details of\r\nworkmen from the army, and made his monthly reports. Thus the niter\r\nproduction, in the course of a year, was brought up to something like\r\nhalf of the total consumption. The district from which the most constant\r\nyield could be relied on had its chief office at Greensboro, North\r\nCarolina, a region which had no niter-caves in it. The niter was\r\nobtained from lixiviation of nitrous earth found under old houses,\r\nbarns, etc. The supervision of the production of iron, lead, copper, and\r\nall the minerals which needed development, as well as the manufacture of\r\nsulphuric and nitric acids (the latter required for the supply of the\r\nfulminate of mercury for percussion-caps), without which the firearms of\r\nour day would have been useless, was added to the niter bureau. Such was\r\nthe progress that, in a short time, the bureau was aiding or managing\r\nsome twenty to thirty furnaces with an annual yield of fifty thousand\r\ntons or more of pig-iron. The lead- and copper-smelting works erected\r\nwere sufficient for all wants, and the smelting of zinc of good quality\r\nhad been achieved. The chemical works were placed at Charlotte, North\r\nCarolina, to serve as a reserve when the supply from abroad might be cut\r\noff.\r\n\r\nIn equipping the armies first sent into the field, the supply of\r\naccessories was embarrassingly scant. There were arms, such as they\r\nwere, for over one hundred thousand men, but no accoutrements nor\r\nequipments, and a meager supply of ammunition. In time the knapsacks\r\nwere supplanted by haversacks, which the women could make. But soldiers'\r\nshoes and cartridge-boxes must be had; leather was also needed for\r\nartillery-harness and for cavalry-saddles; and, as the amount of leather\r\nwhich the country could furnish was quite insufficient for all these\r\npurposes, it was perforce apportioned among them. Soldiers' shoes were\r\nthe prime necessity. Therefore, a scale was established, by which first\r\nshoes and then cartridge-boxes had the preference; after these,\r\nartillery-harness, and then saddles and bridles. To economize leather,\r\nthe waist and cartridge-box belts were made of prepared cotton cloth\r\nstitched in stitched in three or four thicknesses. Bridle-reins were\r\nlikewise so made, and then cartridge-boxes were thus covered, except the\r\nflap. Saddle-skirts, too, were made of heavy cotton cloth strongly\r\nstitched. To get leather, each department procured its quota of hides,\r\nmade contracts with the tanners, obtained hands for them by exemptions\r\nfrom the army, got transportation over the railroads for the hides and\r\nfor supplies. To the varied functions of this bureau was finally added\r\nthat of assisting the tanners to procure the necessary supplies for the\r\ntanneries. A fishery, even, was established on Cape Fear River to get\r\noil for mechanical purposes, and at the same time food for the workmen.\r\nIn cavalry equipments the main thing was to get a good saddle which\r\nwould not hurt the back of the horse. For this purpose various patterns\r\nwere tried, and reasonable success was obtained. One of the most\r\ndifficult wants to supply in this branch of the service was the\r\nhorseshoe for cavalry and artillery. The want of iron and of skilled\r\nlabor was strongly felt. Every wayside blacksmith-shop accessible,\r\nespecially those in and near the theatre of operations, was employed.\r\nThese, again, had to be supplied with material, and the employees\r\nexempted from service.\r\n\r\nIt early became manifest that great reliance must be placed on the\r\nintroduction of articles of prime necessity through the blockaded ports.\r\nA vessel, capable of stowing six hundred and fifty bales of cotton, was\r\npurchased by the agent in England, and kept running between Bermuda and\r\nWilmington. Some fifteen to eighteen successive trips were made before\r\nshe was captured. Another was added, which was equally successful. These\r\nvessels were long, low, rather narrow, and built for speed. They were\r\nmostly of pale sky-color, and, with their lights out and with fuel that\r\nmade little smoke, they ran to and from Wilmington with considerable\r\nregularity. Several others were added, and devoted to bringing in\r\nordnance, and finally general supplies. Depots of stores were likewise\r\nmade at Nassau and Havana. Another organization was also necessary, that\r\nthe vessels coming in through the blockade might have their return\r\ncargoes promptly on their arrival These resources were also supplemented\r\nby contracts for supplies brought through Texas from Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe arsenal in Richmond soon grew into very large dimensions, and\r\nproduced all the ordnance stores that the army required, except cannon\r\nand small-arms, in quantities sufficient to supply the forces in the\r\nfield. The arsenal at Augusta was very serviceable to the armies serving\r\nin the south and west, and turned out a good deal of field-artillery\r\ncomplete. The Government powder-mills were entirely successful. The\r\narsenal and workshops at Charleston were enlarged, steam introduced, and\r\ngood work done in various departments. The arsenal at Mount Vernon,\r\nAlabama, was moved to Selma, in that State, where it grew into a large\r\nand well-ordered establishment of the first class. Mount Vernon Arsenal\r\nwas dismantled, and served to furnish lumber and timber for use\r\nelsewhere. At Montgomery, shops were kept up for the repair of\r\nsmall-arms and the manufacture of articles of leather. There were many\r\nother small establishments and depots.\r\n\r\nThe chief armories were at Richmond and Fayetteville, North Carolina.\r\nThe former turned out about fifteen hundred stands per month, and the\r\nlatter only four hundred per month, for want of operatives. To meet the\r\nwant of cavalry arms, a contract was made for the construction in\r\nRichmond of a factory for Sharp's carbines; this being built, it was\r\nthen converted into a manufactory of rifle-carbines, caliber .58.\r\nSmaller establishments grew up at Asheville, North Carolina, and at\r\nTallahassee, Alabama. A great part of the work of the armories consisted\r\nin the repair of arms. In this manner the gleanings of the battle-fields\r\nwere utilized. Nearly ten thousand stands were saved from the field of\r\nManassas, and from those about Richmond in 1862 about twenty-five\r\nthousand excellent arms. All the stock of inferior arms disappeared from\r\nthe armories during the first two years of the war, and were replaced by\r\na better class of arms, rifled and percussioned. Placing the good arms\r\nlost previous to July, 1863, at one hundred thousand, there must have\r\nbeen received from various sources four hundred thousand stands of\r\ninfantry arms in the first two years of the war.\r\n\r\nAmong the obvious requirements of a well-regulated service was one\r\ncentral laboratory of sufficient capacity to prepare all ammunition, and\r\nthus to secure the vital advantage of absolute uniformity. Authority was\r\ntherefore granted to concentrate this species of work at Macon, Georgia.\r\nPlans of the buildings and of the machinery required were submitted and\r\napproved, and the work was begun with energy. The pile of buildings had\r\na façade of six hundred feet, was designed with taste, and comprehended\r\nevery possible appliance for good and well-organized work. The buildings\r\nwere nearly ready for occupation at the close of the war, and some of\r\nthe machinery had arrived at Bermuda. This project preceded that of a\r\ngeneral armory for the Confederacy, and was much nearer completion.\r\nThese, with the admirable powder-mills at Augusta, would have been\r\ncompleted, and with them the Government would have been in a condition\r\nto supply arms and ammunition to three hundred thousand men. To these\r\nwould have been added a foundry for heavy guns at Selma or Brierfield,\r\nAlabama, where the strongest cast iron in the country had been made.\r\n\r\nThus has been briefly sketched the development of the resources from\r\nwhich our large armies were supplied with arms and ammunition, while our\r\ncountry was invaded on land and water by armies much larger than our\r\nown. It will be seen under what disadvantages our people successfully\r\nprosecuted the (to them) new pursuits of mining and manufacturing. The\r\nchief of ordnance was General J. Gorgas, a man remarkable for his\r\nscientific attainment, for the highest administrative capacity and moral\r\npurity, all crowned by zeal and fidelity to his trust, in which he\r\nachieved results greatly disproportioned to the means at his command. He\r\ncloses his excellent monograph in the following words:\r\n\r\n    \"We began in April, 1861, without an arsenal, laboratory, or\r\n    powder-mill of any capacity, and with no foundry or\r\n    rolling-mill, except in Richmond, and, before the close of 1863,\r\n    or within a little over two years, we supplied them. During the\r\n    harassments of war, while holding our own in the field defiantly\r\n    and successfully against a powerful enemy; crippled by a\r\n    depreciated currency; throttled with a blockade that deprived us\r\n    of nearly all the means of getting material or workmen; obliged\r\n    to send almost every able-bodied man to the field; unable to use\r\n    the slave-labor, with which we were abundantly supplied, except\r\n    in the most unskilled departments of production; hampered by\r\n    want of transportation even of the commonest supplies of food;\r\n    with no stock on hand even of articles such as steel, copper,\r\n    leather, iron, which we must have to build up our\r\n    establishments--against all these obstacles, in spite of all\r\n    these deficiencies, we persevered at home, as determinedly as\r\n    did our troops in the field, against a more tangible opposition;\r\n    and in that short period created, almost literally out of the\r\n    ground, foundries and rolling-mills at Selma, Richmond, Atlanta,\r\n    and Macon; smelting-works at Petersburg, chemical works at\r\n    Charlotte, North Carolina; a powder-mill far superior to any in\r\n    the United States and unsurpassed by any across the ocean; and a\r\n    chain of arsenals, armories, and laboratories equal in their\r\n    capacity and their improved appointments to the best of those in\r\n    the United States, stretching link by link from Virginia to\r\n    Alabama.\"\r\n\r\nThe same officer writes:\r\n\r\n    \"It was a charge often repeated at the North against General\r\n    Floyd, that, as Secretary of War, he had with traitorous intent\r\n    abused his office by sending arms to the South just before the\r\n    secession of the States. The transactions which gave rise to\r\n    this accusation were in the ordinary course of an economical\r\n    administration of the War Department. After it had been\r\n    determined to change the old flint-lock muskets which the United\r\n    States possessed to percussion, it was deemed cheaper to bring\r\n    all the flint-lock arms in store at Southern arsenals to the\r\n    Northern arsenals and armories for alteration, rather than to\r\n    send the necessary machinery and workmen to the South.\r\n    Consequently, the Southern arsenals were stripped of their\r\n    deposits, which were sent to Springfield, Watervliet, Pittsburg,\r\n    St. Louis, and other points. After the conversion had been\r\n    effected, the denuded Southern arsenals were again supplied with\r\n    about the same number, perhaps slightly augmented, that had\r\n    formerly been stored there. The quota deposited at the\r\n    Charleston Arsenal, where I was stationed in 1860, arrived there\r\n    full a year before the opening of the war.\"\r\n\r\nThe charge was made early in the war that I was slow in procuring arms\r\nand munitions of war from Europe. We were not only in advance of the\r\nGovernment of the United States in the markets of Europe, but the facts\r\npresented in the following extracts from a letter of our agent, Caleb\r\nHuse, dated December 30, 1861, and addressed to Major C. C. Anderson,\r\nwill serve to place the matter in its proper light:\r\n\r\n    \"London, _December_ 30, 1861.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Major: We are all waiting with almost breathless anxiety\r\n    for the arrival of the answer from the United States to the\r\n    unqualified demand of England for the captured commissioners.\r\n    Will Mr. Lincoln disregard the international writ of _habeas\r\n    corpus_ served by Great Britain? We shall soon know. If the\r\n    prisoners are given up, the affair will result in great\r\n    inconvenience to us in the way of shipping goods.\r\n\r\n    \"I have now more than enough to load three 'Bermudas,' and can\r\n    not ship a package, though I have a steamer off the wharf, all\r\n    ready to receive her cargo. We are literally fighting two\r\n    governments here. Government watchmen guard the wharf where our\r\n    goods are stowed and others in the neighborhood, night and\r\n    day--and the wharfinger has orders not to ship or deliver, by\r\n    land or water, any goods marked W. D., without first acquainting\r\n    the honorable Board of Customs. I have applied myself to ship to\r\n    Bermuda, offering to give bonds to double the amount of value of\r\n    the goods, that they should be held in Bermuda, subject to the\r\n    direction of her Majesty's representative in Bermuda. I ... has\r\n    applied for permission to ship to Cardenas, agreeing to hold the\r\n    goods subject to the order of the Spanish authorities--but all\r\n    without avail, and our army must suffer for the want of\r\n    blankets, overcoats, shoes, socks, field forges, arms, and\r\n    ammunition, which have been collected to an amount more than\r\n    double that I have yet received.\r\n\r\n    \"It is miserable to have to look at the immense pile of packages\r\n    in the warehouse at St. Andrews Wharf, and not be able to send\r\n    anything--only read the following: twenty-five thousand rifles;\r\n    two thousand barrels of powder; five hundred thousand caps; ten\r\n    thousand friction-tubes; five hundred thousand cartridges;\r\n    thirteen thousand accoutrements; thirteen thousand knapsacks;\r\n    thirteen thousand gun-slings; forty-four thousand three hundred\r\n    and twenty-eight pairs of socks; sixteen thousand four hundred\r\n    and eighty-four blankets; two hundred and twenty-six saddles;\r\n    saddlers' tools; artillery-harness; leather, etc. Very truly\r\n    yours,\r\n\r\n    \"Caleb Huse.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n    Extracts from my Inaugural.--Our Financial System: Receipts and\r\n    Expenditures of the First Year.--Resources, Loans, and\r\n    Taxes.--Loans authorized.--Notes and Bonds.--Funding\r\n    Notes.--Treasury Notes guaranteed by the States.--Measure to\r\n    reduce the Currency.--Operation of the General System.--Currency\r\n    fundable.--Taxation.--Popular Aversion.--Compulsory Reduction of\r\n    the Currency.--Tax Law.--Successful Result.--Financial Condition\r\n    of the Government at its Close.--Sources whence Revenue was\r\n    derived.--Total Public Debt.--System of Direct Taxes and\r\n    Revenue.--The Tariff.--War-Tax of Fifty Cents on a Hundred\r\n    Dollars.--Property subject to it.--Every Resource of the Country\r\n    to be reached.--Tax paid by the States mostly.--Obstacle to the\r\n    taking of the Census.--The Foreign Debt.--Terms of the\r\n    Contract.--Premium.--False charge against me of\r\n    Repudiation.--Facts stated.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my inaugural address in 1862 I said:\r\n\r\n    \"The first year of our history has been the most eventful in the\r\n    annals of this continent. A new Government has been established,\r\n    and its machinery put in operation over an area exceeding seven\r\n    hundred thousand square miles. The great principles upon which\r\n    we have been willing to hazard everything that is dear to man,\r\n    have made conquests for us which could never have been achieved\r\n    by the sword. Our Confederacy has grown from six to thirteen\r\n    States; and Maryland, already united to us by hallowed memories\r\n    and material interests, will, I believe, when enabled to speak\r\n    with unstifled voice, connect her destiny with the South. Our\r\n    people have rallied with unexampled unanimity to the support of\r\n    the great principles of constitutional government, with firm\r\n    resolve to perpetuate by arms the rights which they could not\r\n    peacefully secure. A million of men, it is estimated, are now\r\n    standing in hostile array and waging war along a frontier of\r\n    thousands of miles. Battles have been fought, sieges have been\r\n    conducted, and, although the contest is not ended, and the tide\r\n    for the moment is against us, the final result in our favor is\r\n    not doubtful.... Fellow-citizens, after the struggles of ages\r\n    had consecrated the right of the Englishman to constitutional\r\n    representative government, our colonial ancestors were forced to\r\n    vindicate that birthright by an appeal to arms. Success crowned\r\n    their efforts, and they provided for their posterity a peaceful\r\n    remedy against future aggression.\r\n\r\n    \"The tyranny of an unbridled majority, the most odious and the\r\n    least responsible form of despotism, has denied us both the\r\n    right and the remedy. Therefore, we are in arms to renew such\r\n    sacrifices as our forefathers made to the holy cause of\r\n    constitutional liberty.\"\r\n\r\nThe financial system which had been adopted from necessity proved\r\nadequate at this early period to supply all the wants of the Government\r\nand of the people. An unexpected and very large increase of expenditures\r\nhad resulted from the great enlargement of the necessary means of\r\ndefense. Yet the Government entered on its second year without a\r\nfloating debt and with its credit unimpaired. The total expenditures of\r\nthe first year, ending February 1, 1862, amounted to one hundred and\r\nseventy million dollars. A statement of the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\ncomprising the period from the organization of the Government to August\r\n1, 1862, presents the following results:\r\n\r\nExpenditures: War Department            $298,376,549 41\r\n              Navy    \"                   14,605,777 86\r\nCivil and miscellaneous                   15,766,503 43\r\n                                        ---------------\r\n    Total                               $328,748,830 70\r\nOutstanding requisitions                  18,524,128 15\r\n                                        ---------------\r\n    Total expenditures                  347,272,958 85\r\n    Total receipts                      302,482,096 60\r\n                                        ---------------\r\nDeficient Treasury notes authorized      16,755,165 00\r\n    \"        \"       \"   to be provided  28,035,697 25\r\n                                        ---------------\r\n                                        $44,790,862 25\r\n\r\nThe receipts were derived as follows:\r\n\r\nCustoms                                $1,437,399 96\r\nWar-tax                                10,539,910 70\r\nMiscellaneous                           1,974,769 33     $13,952,079 99\r\nLoans, bonds, February, 1861           15,000,000 00\r\nBonds, August, 1861                    22,613,346 61\r\nCall certificates, December, 1861      37,515,200 00\r\nTreasury notes, April, 1861            22,799,900 00\r\nDemand notes, August, 1861            187,130,670 00\r\nOne and two dollar notes                  846,900 00\r\nDue banks                               2,645,000 00    $288,551,016 61\r\n                                                        ---------------\r\n    Total receipts                                      $302,503,096 60\r\n\r\nSuch was the result presented by the Treasury of a Government that had\r\nbeen in existence only eighteen months. It commenced that existence\r\nwithout a treasury, and, without the sinews and the munitions of war,\r\nwas in less than two months invaded on every side by an implacable foe.\r\nIts ways and means consisted in loans and taxes, and to these it\r\nresorted. On February 28th I was authorized by Congress to borrow, at\r\nany time within twelve months, fifteen million dollars, or less, as\r\nmight be needed. It was to be applied to the payment of appropriations\r\nfor the support of the Government, and for the public defense.\r\nCertificates of stock or bonds, payable in ten years at eight per cent.\r\ninterest, were issued. For the payment of the interest and principal of\r\nthis loan a tax or duty of one eighth of one per cent. per pound was\r\nlaid on all cotton exported. On March 9th an issue of one million\r\ndollars in Treasury notes of fifty dollars and upward was authorized,\r\npayable in one year from date, at 3.65 per cent. interest, and\r\nreceivable for all public debts except the export duty on cotton. A\r\nreissue was authorized for a year. On May 16th a loan of fifty million\r\ndollars in bonds, payable after twenty years at eight per cent.\r\ninterest, was authorized. The bonds were \"to be sold for specie,\r\nmilitary stores, or for the proceeds of sales of raw produce or\r\nmanufactured articles, to be paid in the form of specie or with foreign\r\nbills of exchange.\" The bonds could not be issued in fractional parts of\r\na hundred dollars, or be exchanged for Treasury notes or the notes of\r\nany bank, corporation, or individual. In lieu of any amount of these\r\nbonds, not exceeding twenty million dollars, an equal amount of Treasury\r\nnotes, without interest, in denominations of five dollars and upward,\r\nwas authorized to be issued. These notes were payable in two years in\r\nspecie, and were receivable for all debts or taxes except the export\r\nduty on cotton. They were also convertible into bonds payable in ten\r\nyears at eight per cent. interest. On August 19th another issue of\r\nTreasury notes, amounting with those then issued to one hundred million\r\ndollars, was authorized. They were of the denominations of five dollars\r\nand upward. They were receivable for the war-tax and all other public\r\ndues except the export duty on cotton. These notes were convertible into\r\ntwenty-year bonds, bearing eight per cent. interest, of which the issue\r\nwas limited to one hundred million dollars. Thirty millions were to be a\r\nsubstitute for the same amount, authorized by the act of May 16, 1861.\r\nThese bonds could be exchanged for specie, military and naval stores, or\r\nfor the proceeds of raw produce and manufactured articles. On December\r\n19th ten million dollars in Treasury notes were issued to pay the\r\nadvance of the banks. On December 24th an additional issue of fifty\r\nmillions of Treasury notes like those of the act of August 19th was\r\nauthorized. An additional issue of thirty millions of bonds was also\r\nauthorized. On April 12, 1862, an issue of Treasury notes, certificates\r\nof stock and bonds, as the public necessities might require, to the\r\namount of two hundred and fifteen millions, was authorized. Of these,\r\nfifty millions in Treasury notes were issued without reserve, ten\r\nmillions in Treasury notes retained as a reserve fund to pay any sudden\r\nor unexpected call for deposits, and one hundred and sixty-five millions\r\ncertificates of stock or bonds. Bonds to the amount of fifty million\r\ndollars, payable in ten years at six per cent. interest, were authorized\r\nand made exchangeable for any of the above Treasury notes. All these\r\nnotes and bonds were subject to the same conditions as those of the acts\r\nof August 19 and December 24, 1861. On April 17th five millions of\r\nTreasury notes were authorized to be issued in denominations of one and\r\ntwo dollars, which were receivable for all public dues except the cotton\r\nduty. An amount of Treasury notes bearing interest at two cents per day\r\non each hundred dollars, as a substitute for as much of the one hundred\r\nand sixty-five millions of bonds authorized, was also authorized to be\r\nissued. On September 19, 1862, three million five hundred thousand\r\ndollars in bonds was authorized to be issued to meet a contract for six\r\niron-clad vessels of war. On September 23, 1862, the amount of Treasury\r\nnotes under the denomination of five dollars was increased from five\r\nmillion to ten million dollars, and a further issue of bonds or\r\ncertificates of stock, to the amount of fifty million dollars, was\r\nauthorized.\r\n\r\nOn March 23, 1863, an effort was made to remove from circulation some of\r\nthe issues of Treasury notes by funding them. For this purpose it was\r\nprovided that all Treasury notes, not bearing interest, issued prior to\r\nDecember, 1862, should be fundable in eight per cent. bonds or stock\r\nduring the ensuing thirty days, and during the succeeding three months\r\nin seven per cent. bonds or stock, after which they ceased to be\r\nfundable. All Treasury notes not bearing interest, and issued after\r\nDecember 1, 1862, until ten days after the passage of the act, were made\r\nfundable in seven per cent. bonds or stock during the ensuing four\r\nmonths, and afterward only in four per cent. thirty years bonds. Call\r\ncertificates were made fundable in thirty years bonds at eight per\r\ncent., and all outstanding on the ensuing July 1st were deemed bonds at\r\nsix per cent., payable in thirty years. A monthly issue of Treasury\r\nnotes, without interest, to the amount of fifty million dollars, was\r\nalso authorized. These were made fundable during the first year of their\r\nissue in six per cent. thirty years bonds, and after the expiration of\r\nthe year in four per cent. thirty years bonds. The further issue of call\r\ncertificates was suspended; but Treasury notes fundable in the six per\r\ncent. bonds might be converted, at the pleasure of the holder, into such\r\ncertificates at five per cent. interest, which were reconvertible into\r\nlike notes within six months, or afterward exchanged for thirty years\r\nsix per cent. bonds. Treasury notes fundable in four per cent. bonds\r\nwere convertible in like manner at four per cent. All disposable means\r\nin the Treasury were to be applied to the purchase of Treasury notes,\r\nbearing no interest, until the amount in circulation did not exceed one\r\nhundred and seventy-five millions. The issue of five million dollars, in\r\nnotes of two dollars, one dollar, and fifty cents, was also authorized.\r\nIt was further provided in this act that six per cent. bonds, as above\r\nmentioned, might be sold to any of the States for Treasury notes, and,\r\nbeing guaranteed by any of the States, they might be used to purchase\r\nTreasury notes. The whole amount of such bonds could not exceed two\r\nhundred million dollars. Treasury notes so purchased were not to be\r\nreissued. The issue of six per cent. coupon bonds to the amount of one\r\nhundred million dollars, which were to be applied only to the absorption\r\nof Treasury notes, was also authorized. The coupons were payable either\r\nin the currency in which interest on other bonds was paid, or in cotton\r\ncertificates pledging the Government to pay the same in cotton of New\r\nOrleans middling quality, delivered at the rate of eight pence sterling\r\nper pound.\r\n\r\nAn important measure was adopted on February 17, 1864, the object of\r\nwhich was to reduce the currency and to authorize a new issue of notes\r\nand bonds. All Treasury notes above the denomination of five dollars,\r\nand not bearing interest, were, if offered within a short period, made\r\nfundable in registered twenty years bonds at four per cent. At the same\r\ntime a new issue of Treasury notes was authorized, and made receivable\r\nfor all public dues, except customs duties, at the rate of two dollars\r\nfor three of the old. The issue of other Treasury notes, after the 1st\r\nof the ensuing April, was prohibited.\r\n\r\nTo pay the expenses of the Government an issue of five hundred million\r\ndollars in six per cent. bonds was authorized. For the payment of\r\ninterest the receipts of the export and import duties, payable in\r\nspecie, were pledged.\r\n\r\nA review of this statement of the legislation of Congress will clearly\r\npresent the financial system of the Government. The first action of the\r\nProvisional Congress was confined to the adoption of a tariff law, and\r\nan act for a loan of fifteen million dollars, with a pledge of a small\r\nexport duty on cotton, to provide for the redemption of the debt. At the\r\nnext session, after the commencement of the war, provision was made for\r\nthe issue of twenty million dollars in Treasury notes, and for borrowing\r\nthirty million dollars in bonds. At the same time the tariff was\r\nrevised, and preparatory measures taken for the levy of internal taxes.\r\nAfter the purpose of subjugation became manifest by the action of the\r\nCongress of the United States, early in July, 1861, and the certainty of\r\na long war was demonstrated, there arose the necessity that a financial\r\nsystem should be devised on a basis sufficiently large for the vast\r\nproportions of the approaching contest. The plan then adopted was\r\nfounded on the theory of issuing Treasury notes, convertible at the\r\npleasure of the holder into eight per cent. bonds, with the interest\r\npayable in coin. It was assumed that any tendency to depreciation, which\r\nmight arise from the over-issue of the currency, would be checked by the\r\nconstant exercise of the holder's right to fund the notes at a liberal\r\ninterest, payable in specie. The success of this system depended on the\r\nability of the Government constantly to pay the interest in specie. The\r\nmeasures, therefore, adopted to secure that payment consisted in the\r\nlevy of an internal tax, termed a war tax, and the appropriation of the\r\nrevenue from imports.\r\n\r\nThe first operation of this plan was quite successful. The interest was\r\npaid from the reserve of coin existing in the country, and experience\r\nsustained the expectations of those who devised the system.\r\n\r\nWheat, in the beginning of the year 1862, was selling at one dollar and\r\nthirty cents per bushel, thus but little exceeding its average price in\r\ntime of peace. The other agricultural products of the country were at\r\nsimilarly moderate rates, thus indicating that there was no excess of\r\ncirculation. At the same time the premium on coin had reached about\r\ntwenty per cent. But it had become apparent that the commerce of our\r\ncountry was threatened with permanent suspension by reason of the\r\nconduct of neutral nations, who virtually gave aid to the United States\r\nGovernment by sanctioning its declaration of a blockade. These neutral\r\nnations treated our invasion by our former limited and special agent as\r\nthough it were the attempt of a sovereign to suppress a rebellion\r\nagainst lawful authority. This exceptional cause heightened the premium\r\non specie, because it indicated the exhaustion of our reserve, without\r\nthe possibility of renewing the supply.\r\n\r\nAt the inauguration of the permanent Government, in February, 1862, a\r\npopular aversion to internal taxation had been so strongly manifested as\r\nto indicate its partial failure. This will be further explained\r\npresently in our statement of the system of taxation.\r\n\r\nUnder all these circumstances the effort was made to avoid the increase\r\nin the volume of notes in circulation, by offering inducements to\r\nvoluntary funding. The measures adopted for that purpose were but\r\npartially successful. Meanwhile the intervening exigencies from the\r\nfortunes of war permitted no delay. The issues of Treasury notes were\r\nincreased until, in December, 1863, the currency in circulation amounted\r\nto more than six hundred million dollars, or more than threefold the\r\namount required by the business of the country. The evil effects of this\r\nfinancial condition were but too apparent. In addition to the difficulty\r\npresented to the necessary operations of the Government, and the\r\nefficient conduct of the war, the most deplorable of all its results\r\nwas, undoubtedly, its corrupting influence on the morals of the people.\r\nThe possession of large amounts of Treasury notes led to a desire for\r\ninvestment; and, with a constantly increasing volume of currency, there\r\nwas an equally constant increase of price in all objects of investment.\r\nThis effect stimulated purchase by the apparent certainty of profit, and\r\na spirit of speculation was thus fostered, which had so debasing an\r\ninfluence and such ruinous consequences that it became our highest duty\r\nto remove the cause by prompt and stringent measures.\r\n\r\nI therefore recommended to Congress, in December, 1863, the compulsory\r\nreduction of the currency to the amount required by the business of the\r\ncountry, accompanied by a pledge that, under no stress of circumstances,\r\nwould the amount be increased. I stated that, if the currency was not\r\ngreatly and promptly reduced, the existing scale of inflated prices\r\nwould not only continue, but, by the very fact of the large amounts thus\r\nmade requisite in the conduct of the war, these prices would reach rates\r\nstill more extravagant, and the whole system would fall under its own\r\nweight, rendering the redemption of the debt impossible, and destroying\r\nits value in the hands of the holder. If, on the contrary, a funded\r\ndebt, with interest secured by adequate taxation, could be substituted\r\nfor the outstanding currency, its entire amount would be made available\r\nto the holder, and the Government would be in a condition, beyond the\r\nreach of any probable contingency, to prosecute the war to a successful\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nThis recommendation was followed by the passage of the act of February\r\n17, 1864, above mentioned. One of its features is the tax levied on the\r\ncirculation. Regarding the Government when contracting a debt as the\r\nagent of the people, its debt is their debt. As the currency was held\r\nexclusively by ourselves, it was obvious that, if each person, held\r\nTreasury notes in exact proportion to the valuation of his whole estate,\r\neach would in fact owe himself the amount of the notes held by him; and,\r\nwere it possible to distribute the currency among the people in this\r\nexact proportion, a tax levied on the currency alone, to an amount\r\nsufficient to reduce it to its proper limits, would afford the best of\r\nall remedies. Under such circumstances, the notes remaining in the hands\r\nof each holder after the payment of his tax would be worth quite as much\r\nas the whole sum previously held, for it would have an equal purchasing\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nAfter this law had been in operation for one year, it was manifest that\r\nit had the desired effect of withdrawing from circulation the large\r\nexcess of Treasury notes which had been issued. On July 1, 1864, the\r\noutstanding amount was estimated at two hundred and thirty million\r\ndollars. The estimate of the amount funded under this act, about this\r\ntime, was three hundred million dollars, while new notes were authorized\r\nto be issued to the extent of two thirds of the sum received under its\r\nprovisions. The chief difficulty apprehended in connection with our\r\nfinances, up to the close of the war, resulted from the depreciation of\r\nour Treasury notes, which was to be attributed to the increasing\r\nredundancy in amount and the diminishing confidence in their ultimate\r\nredemption.\r\n\r\nThe financial condition of the Government, near its close, is very\r\ncorrectly represented in the report of the Treasury Department. The\r\ntotal receipts of the Treasury for the two quarters ending on September\r\n30, 1864, amounted to $415,191,550, which sum, added to the balance,\r\n$308,282,722, that remained in the Treasury on April 1, 1864, formed a\r\ntotal of $723,474,272. Of this total, not far from half, that is to say,\r\n$342,560,327, were applied to the extinction of the public debt; while\r\nthe total expenditures were $272,378,505, leaving a balance in the\r\nTreasury on October 1, 1864, of $108,435,440. The sources from which\r\nthis revenue was derived were as follows:\r\n\r\nFour per cent. registered bonds,\r\n  act of February 17, 1864                     $13,363,500\r\nSix per cent. bonds, $500,000,000 loan,\r\n  act of February 17, 1864                      14,481,050\r\nFour per cent. call certificates,\r\n  act of February 17, 1864                      20,978,100\r\nTax on old issue of certificates redeemed      $14,440,566\r\nRepayments by disbursing officers               20,115,830\r\nTreasury notes, act of February 17, 1864       277,576,950\r\nWar-tax                                         42,294,314\r\nSequestrations                                   1,338,732\r\nCustoms                                             50,004\r\nExport duty                                          4,320\r\nCoin seized by the Secretary of War              1,653,200\r\nPremium on loans                                 4,822,249\r\nSoldiers' tax                                      908,622\r\n\r\nThe total amount of the public debt on October 1, 1864, on the books of\r\nthe Register of the Treasury, was $1,147,970,208, of which $530,340,090\r\nwere funded debt, bearing interest, and $283,880,150 were Treasury notes\r\nof the new issue, and the remainder consisted of the former issue of\r\nTreasury notes which were converted into other forms of debt, and ceased\r\nto exist on December 31st. In consequence, however, of the absence of\r\ncertain returns from distant officers, the true amount of the debt was\r\nless by $21,500,000 than appeared on the books of the Register; so that\r\nthe total public debt, on October 1st, might have been fairly considered\r\nto have been $1,126,381,095. Of this amount, $541,340,090 consisted of\r\nfunded debt, and the balance unfunded debt, or Treasury notes. The\r\nforeign debt is omitted in these statements. It amounted to £2,200,000,\r\nand was provided for by about two hundred and fifty thousand bales of\r\ncotton collected by the Government.[192]\r\n\r\nThe aggregate appropriations called for by the different departments of\r\nthe Government for the six months ending on June 30, 1865, amounted to\r\n$438,416,504. It was estimated that the remains of former appropriations\r\nwould, on January 1, 1865, amount to a balance of $467,416,504. No\r\nadditional appropriations were therefore required for the ensuing six\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nA system of measures by which to obtain a revenue from direct taxes and\r\nduties was commenced at the first session of Congress under the\r\nprovisional Government. The officers who, at the time of the adoption of\r\nthe provisional Constitution, held any office connected with the\r\ncollection of the customs, duties, and imposts in the several States of\r\nthe Confederacy, or as assistant treasurers intrusted with the keeping\r\nof moneys arising therefrom, were continued in office with the same\r\npowers and subject to the same duties. The tariff laws of the United\r\nStates were continued in force until they might be altered. The free\r\nlist was enlarged so as to embrace many articles of necessity;\r\nadditional ports and places of entry were established; restrictive laws\r\nwere repealed, and foreign vessels were admitted to the coasting-trade.\r\nA lighthouse bureau was organized; a lower rate of duties was imposed on\r\na number of enumerated articles, and an export duty of one eighth of one\r\ncent per pound was imposed on all cotton exported in the raw state. At\r\nthe second session, in May, a complete tariff law was enacted, with a\r\nlower scale of duties than had previously existed. On August 19, 1861, a\r\nwar-tax of fifty cents on each hundred dollars of certain classes of\r\nproperty was levied for the special purpose of paying the principal and\r\ninterest of the public debt, and of supporting the Government. The\r\ndifferent classes of property on which the tax was levied were as\r\nfollows: real estate of all kinds; slaves; merchandise; bank-stocks;\r\nrailroad and other corporation stocks; money at interest, or invested by\r\nindividuals in the purchase of bills, notes, and other securities for\r\nmoney, except the bonds of the Confederate States, and cash on hand, or\r\non deposit; cattle, horses, and mules; gold watches, gold and silver\r\nplate, pianos, and pleasure-carriages. There were some exemptions, such\r\nas the property of educational, charitable, and religious institutions,\r\nand of a head of a family having property worth less than five hundred\r\ndollars. An act was passed for the sequestration of the property of\r\nalien enemies, as a retaliatory measure, to offset the confiscation act\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nOn April 24, 1863, a new act was passed relative to internal or direct\r\ntaxes. It was designed to reach, as far as practicable, every resource\r\nof the country except the capital invested in real estate and slaves,\r\nand, by means of an income-tax and a tax in kind on the produce of the\r\nsoil, as well as by licenses on business occupations and professions, to\r\ncommand resources sufficient for the wants of the country. On February\r\n17, 1864, an amendment to this last-mentioned act was passed. It levied\r\nadditional taxes on all business of individuals, of copartnerships and\r\ncorporations, also on trades, sales, liquor-dealers, hotel-keepers,\r\ndistillers, and a tax in kind on agriculturists. On June 10, 1864, an\r\nact was passed which levied a tax equal to one fifth of the amount of\r\nthe existing tax upon all subjects of taxation for the year.\r\n\r\nWithin six months after the passage of the war-tax of August 19, 1861,\r\nthe popular aversion to internal taxation by the General Government had\r\nso influenced the legislation of the several States that only in South\r\nCarolina, Mississippi, and Texas were the taxes actually collected from\r\nthe people. The quotas of the remaining States had been raised by the\r\nissue of bonds and State Treasury notes. The public debt of the country\r\nwas thus actually increased instead of being diminished by the taxation\r\nimposed by Congress.\r\n\r\nAt the first and second sessions of Congress in 1862 no means were\r\nprovided by taxation for maintaining the Government. The legislation was\r\nconfined to authorizing further sales of bonds and issues of Treasury\r\nnotes. An obstacle had arisen against successful taxation. About two\r\nthirds of the entire taxable property of the Confederate States\r\nconsisted in land and slaves. Under the provisional Constitution, which\r\nceased to be in force on February 22, 1862, the power of Congress to\r\nlevy taxes was not restricted by any other condition than that \"all\r\nduties, imposts, and excises should be uniform throughout the States of\r\nthe Confederacy.\" But in the permanent Constitution, which took effect\r\non the same day (February 22d), it was specially provided that\r\n\"representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several\r\nStates according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined\r\nby adding to the whole number of free persons--including those bound to\r\nservice for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed--three\r\nfifths of all slaves.\" According to the received construction of the\r\nConstitution of the United States, which had been acquiesced in for\r\nsixty years, taxes on lands and slaves were direct taxes. In repeating,\r\nwithout modification, in our Constitution this language of the United\r\nStates Constitution, our Convention necessarily seems to have intended\r\nto attach to it the meaning which had been sanctioned by long and\r\nuninterrupted acquiescence--thus deciding that taxes on lands and slaves\r\nwere direct taxes. Our Constitution further ordered that a census should\r\nbe made within three years after the first meeting of Congress, and that\r\n\"no capitation or other direct tax shall be laid, unless in proportion\r\nto the census or enumeration hereinbefore directed to be taken.\"\r\n\r\nSo long as there seemed to be a probability of being able to carry out\r\nthese provisions of the Constitution fully, and in conformity with the\r\nintentions of its authors, there was an obvious difficulty in framing\r\nany system of taxation. A law which should exempt from the burden two\r\nthirds of the property of the country would be as unfair to the owners\r\nof the remaining third as it would be inadequate to meet the\r\nrequirements of the public service. The urgency of the need, however,\r\nwas such that, after great embarrassment, the law of April 24, 1863,\r\nabove mentioned, was framed. Still, a very large proportion of these\r\nresources was unavailable for some time, and, the intervening exigencies\r\npermitting of no delay, a resort to further issues of Treasury notes\r\nbecame unavoidable.\r\n\r\nThe foreign debt of the Confederate States at the close of the war was\r\ntwenty-two hundred thousand pounds. The earliest proposals on which this\r\ndebt was contracted were issued in London and Paris in March, 1863. The\r\nbonds bore interest at seven per cent. per annum, in sterling, payable\r\nhalf-yearly. They were exchangeable for cotton on application, at the\r\noption of the holder, or redeemable at par in sterling, in twenty years,\r\nby half-yearly drawings, commencing March 1, 1864. The special security\r\nof these bonds was the engagement of the Government to deliver cotton to\r\nthe holders. Each bond, _at the option of the holder_, was convertible\r\nat its nominal amount into cotton at the rate of sixpence sterling for\r\neach pound of cotton--say four thousand pounds of cotton for each bond\r\nof a hundred pounds, or twenty-five hundred francs; and this could be\r\ndone at any time not later than six months after the ratification of a\r\ntreaty of peace between the belligerents. Sixty days after the notice,\r\nthe cotton was to be delivered, if in a state of peace, at the ports of\r\nCharleston, Savannah, Mobile, or New Orleans; if at war, at points in\r\nthe interior of the country, within ten miles of a railroad, or a stream\r\nnavigable to the ocean. The delivery was to be made free of all charges,\r\nexcept the export duty of one eighth of one cent per pound. The quality\r\nof the cotton was to be the standard of New Orleans middling. An annual\r\nsinking fund of five per cent. was provided for, whereby two and a half\r\nper cent. of the bonds unredeemed by cotton should be drawn by lot\r\nhalf-yearly, so as finally to extinguish the loan in twenty years from\r\nthe first drawing. The bonds were issued at ninety per cent., payable in\r\ninstallments. The loan soon stood in the London market at five per cent.\r\npremium. The amount asked for was three million pounds. The amount of\r\napplications in London and Paris exceeded fifteen million pounds.\r\n\r\nGreat efforts had previously been made by agents of the United States\r\nGovernment to reflect upon the credit of the Confederate States, by\r\nresuscitating an almost forgotten accusation of repudiation against the\r\nState of Mississippi, and especially by an emissary sent to Great\r\nBritain, than whom no one knew better how false were the attempts to\r\nimplicate my name in that charge. The slanderous tongues of Northern\r\nhatred even went so far as to style me \"the father of repudiation.\" How\r\nunjust all such assertions were, will be manifest by a simple statement\r\nof the case.[193]\r\n\r\nWe should not omit to refer once more to the most prolific source of\r\nsectional strife and alienation, which is believed to have been the\r\nquestion of the tariff, or duties upon imports. Its influence extended\r\nto and affected subjects with which it was not visibly connected, and\r\nfinally assumed a form surely not contemplated in the original formation\r\nof the Union. In the Articles of Confederation, the first Constitution\r\nof the United States, the theory was that of direct taxation, and the\r\nmanner was to impose upon the States an amount which each was to furnish\r\nto the common Treasury to defray expenses for the common defense and\r\ngeneral welfare.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of our colonial existence, the policy of the British\r\nGovernment had been to suppress the growth of manufacturing industry. It\r\nwas forcibly expressed by Lord North in the declaration that \"not a\r\nhobnail should be made in the American colonies.\" The consequence was\r\nthat in the War of the Revolution our armies and people suffered so much\r\nfrom the want of the most necessary supplies that General Washington,\r\nafter we had achieved our independence, expressed the opinion that the\r\nGovernment should by bounties, encourage the manufacture of such\r\nmaterials as were necessary in time of war.\r\n\r\nIn the Convention which framed the Constitution for a \"more perfect\r\nUnion,\" one of the greatest difficulties in agreeing upon its terms was\r\nfound in the different interests of the States, but, among the\r\ncompromises which were made, there prominently appears the purpose of a\r\nstrict equality in the burdens to be borne, as well as the blessings to\r\nbe enjoyed, by the people of the several States. For a long time after\r\nthe formation of the \"more perfect Union,\" but little capital was\r\ninvested in manufacturing establishments; and, though in the early part\r\nof the present century the amount had considerably increased, the\r\nproducts were yet quite insufficient for the necessary supplies of our\r\narmies in the War of 1812. Government contracts, high prices, and to\r\nsome extent, no doubt, patriotic impulses, led to the investment of\r\ncapital in the articles required for the prosecution of the war. With\r\nthe restoration of peace and the renewal of commerce, prices naturally\r\ndeclined, and it was represented that the investments made in\r\nmanufacturing establishments were so unprofitable as to involve the ruin\r\nof those who had made them. The Congress of the United States, in 1816,\r\nfrom motives at least to be commended for their generosity, enacted a\r\nlaw to protect from the threatened ruin those of their countrymen who\r\nhad employed their capital for purposes demanded by the general welfare\r\nand common defense. These good intentions, if it be conceded that the\r\ndanger was real which it was designed to avert, were most unfortunate as\r\nthe beginning of a policy the end of which was fraught with the greatest\r\nevils that have ever befallen the Union. By the Constitution of 1789\r\npower was conferred upon Congress--\r\n\r\n    \"To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay\r\n    the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare\r\n    of the United States; but all duties, imposts, and excises shall\r\n    be uniform throughout the United States.\"\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of this delegated trust, tariff laws were enacted, and\r\nhad been in operation to the satisfaction of all parts of the Union,\r\nfrom the organization of the Government down to 1816; but throughout\r\nthat period all of those laws were based upon the principle of duties\r\nfor revenue. It was true, and of course it was known, that such duties\r\nwould give incidental protection to any industry producing an article on\r\nwhich the duty was levied; but, while the money was collected for the\r\npurposes enumerated, and the rate kept down to the lowest revenue\r\nstandard, the consumer had no cause to complain of the indirect benefit\r\nreceived by the manufacturer, and the history of the time shows that it\r\nproduced no discontent. Not so with the tariff law of 1816: though\r\nsustained by men from all sections of the Union, and notably by so\r\nstrict a constructionist as Mr. Calhoun, there were not wanting those\r\nwho saw in it a departure from the limitation of the Constitution, and\r\nsternly opposed it as the usurpation of a power to legislate for the\r\nbenefit of a class. The law derived much of its support from the\r\nassurance that it was only a temporary measure, and intended to shield\r\nthose whose patriotism had exposed them to danger, thus presenting the\r\nnot uncommon occurrence of a good case making a bad precedent. For the\r\nfirst time a tariff law had protection for its object, and for the first\r\ntime it produced discontent. In the law there was nothing which\r\nnecessarily gave to it or in its terms violated the obligation that\r\nduties should be uniform throughout the United States. The fact that it\r\naffected the sections differently was due to physical causes--that is,\r\ngeographical differences. The streams of the Southern Atlantic States\r\nran over wide plains into the sea; their last falls were remote from\r\nocean navigation; and their people, almost exclusively agricultural,\r\nresided principally on this plain, and as near to the seaboard as\r\ncircumstances would permit. In the Northern Atlantic States the\r\nhighlands approached more nearly to the sea, and the rivers made their\r\nlast leap near to harbors of commerce. Water-power being relied on\r\nbefore the steam-engine had been made, and ships the medium of commerce\r\nbefore railroads and locomotives were introduced, it followed that the\r\nstaples of the Southern plains were economically sent to the water-power\r\nof the North to be manufactured. This remark, of course, applies to such\r\narticles as were not exported to foreign countries, and is intended to\r\nexplain how the North became the seat of manufactures, and the South\r\nremained agricultural. From this it followed that legislation for the\r\nbenefit of manufacturers became a Northern policy. It was not, as has\r\nbeen erroneously stated, because of the agricultural character of the\r\nSouthern people, that they were opposed to the policy inaugurated by the\r\ntariff act of 1816. This is shown by the fact that anterior to that time\r\nthey had been the friends of manufacturing industry, without reference\r\nto its location. As long as duties were imposed for revenue, so that the\r\nobject was to supply the common Treasury, it had been cheerfully borne,\r\nand the agriculture of one section and the manufacturing of another were\r\nproperly regarded as handmaids, and not unfrequently referred to as the\r\nmeans of strengthening and perpetuating the bonds by which the States\r\nwere united. When duties were imposed, not for revenue, but as a bounty\r\nto a particular industry, it was regarded both as unjust and without\r\nwarrant, expressed or implied, in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThen arose the controversy, quadrennially renewed and with increasing\r\nprovocation, in 1820, in 1824, and in 1828--each stage intensifying the\r\ndiscontent, arising more from the injustice than the weight of the\r\nburden borne. It was not the twenty-shilling ship-money tax, but the\r\nviolation of Magna Charta, which Hampden and his associates resisted. It\r\nwas not the stamp duty nor the tea-tax, but the principle involved in\r\ntaxation without representation, against which our colonial fathers took\r\nup arms. So the tariff act in 1828, known at the time as \"the bill of\r\nabominations,\" was resisted by Southern representatives, because it was\r\nthe invasion of private rights in violation of the compact by which the\r\nStates were united. In the last stage of the proceeding, after the\r\nfriends of the bill had advocated it as a measure for protecting capital\r\ninvested in manufactures, Mr. Drayton, of South Carolina, moved to amend\r\nthe title so that it should read, \"An act to increase the duties upon\r\ncertain imports, for the purpose of increasing the profits of certain\r\nmanufacturers,\" and stated his purpose for desiring to amend the title\r\nto be that, upon some case which would arise under the execution of the\r\nlaw, an appeal might be made to the Supreme Court of the United States\r\nto test its constitutionality. Those who had passed the bill refused to\r\nallow the opportunity to test the validity of a tax imposed for the\r\nprotection of a particular industry. Though the debates showed clearly\r\nenough the purpose to be to impose duties for protection, the\r\nphraseology of the law presented it as enacted to raise revenue, and\r\ntherefore the victims of the discrimination were deprived of an appeal\r\nto the tribunal instituted to hear and decide on the constitutionality\r\nof a law.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina, oppressed by onerous duties and stung by the injustice\r\nof a refusal to allow her the ordinary remedy against unconstitutional\r\nlegislation, asserted the right, as a sovereign State, to nullify the\r\nlaw. This conflict between the authority of the United States and one of\r\nthe States threatened for a time such disastrous consequences as to\r\nexcite intense feeling in all who loved the Union as the fraternal\r\nfederation of equal States. Before an actual collision of arms occurred,\r\nCongress wisely adopted the compromise act of 1833. By that the fact of\r\nprotection remained, but the principle of duties for revenue was\r\nrecognized by a sliding scale of reduction, and it was hoped the\r\nquestion had been placed upon a basis that promised a permanent peace.\r\nThe party of protective duties, however, came into power about the close\r\nof the period when the compromise measure had reached the result it\r\nproposed, and the contest was renewed with little faith on the part of\r\nthe then dominant party and with more than all of its former bitterness.\r\nThe cause of the departure from a sound principle of a tariff for\r\nrevenue, which had prevailed during the first quarter of a century, and\r\nthe adoption in 1816 of the rule imposing duties for protection, was\r\nstated by Mr. McDuffie to be that politicians and capitalists had seized\r\nupon the subject and used it for their own purposes--the former for\r\npolitical advancement, the latter for their own pecuniary profit--and\r\nthat the question had become one of partisan politics and sectional\r\nenrichment. Contemporaneously with this theory of protective duties,\r\narose the policy of making appropriations from the common Treasury for\r\nlocal improvements. As the Southern representatives were mainly those\r\nwho denied the constitutional power to make such expenditures, it\r\nnaturally resulted that the mass of those appropriations were made for\r\nNorthern works. Now that direct taxes had in practice been so wholly\r\nabandoned as to be almost an obsolete idea, and now that the Treasury\r\nwas supplied by the collection of duties upon imports, two golden\r\nstreams flowed steadily to enrich the Northern and manufacturing region\r\nby the impoverishment of the Southern and agricultural section. In the\r\ntrain of wealth and demand for labor followed immigration and the more\r\nrapid increase of population in the Northern than in the Southern\r\nStates. I do not deny the existence of other causes, such as the fertile\r\nregion of the Northwest, the better harbors, the greater amount of\r\nshipping of the Northeastern States, and the prejudice of Europeans\r\nagainst contact with the negro race; but the causes I have first stated\r\nwere, I think, the chief, and those only which are referable to the\r\naction of the General Government. It was not found that the possession\r\nof power mitigated the injustice of its use by the North, and discontent\r\ntherefore was steadily accumulating, and, as stated in the beginning of\r\nthis chapter, I think was due to class legislation in the form of\r\nprotective duties and its consequences more than to any or all other\r\ncauses combined. Turning from the consideration of this question in its\r\nsectional aspect, I now invite attention to its general effect upon the\r\ncharacter of our institutions. If the common Treasury of the States had,\r\nas under the Confederation, been supplied by direct taxation, who can\r\ndoubt that a rigid economy would have been the rule of the Government;\r\nthat representatives would have returned to their tax-paying\r\nconstituents to justify appropriations for which they had voted by\r\nshowing that they were required for the general welfare, and were\r\nauthorized by the Constitution under which they were acting? When the\r\nmoney was obtained by indirect taxation, so that but few could see the\r\nsource from which it was derived, it readily followed that a\r\nconstituency would ask, not why the representative had voted for the\r\nexpenditure of money, but how much he had got for his own district, and\r\nperhaps he might have to explain why he did not get more. Is it doubtful\r\nthat this would lead to extravagance, if not to corruption? Nothing\r\ncould be more fatal to the independence of the people and the liberties\r\nof the States than dependence for support upon the public Treasury,\r\nwhether it be in the form of subsidies, of bounties, or restrictions on\r\ntrade for the benefit of special interests. In the decline of the Roman\r\nEmpire, the epoch in which the hopelessness of renovation was made\r\nmanifest was that in which the people accepted corn from the public\r\ngranaries: it preceded but a little the time when the post of emperor\r\nbecame a matter of purchase. How far would it differ from this if\r\nconstituencies should choose their representatives, not for their\r\nintegrity, not for their capacity, not for their past services, but\r\nbecause of their ability to get money from the public Treasury for the\r\nbenefit of their local interests; and how far would it differ from a\r\npurchase of the office if a President were chosen because of the favor\r\nhe would show to certain moneyed interests?\r\n\r\nNow that fanaticism can no longer inflame the prejudices of the\r\nuninformed, it may be hoped that our statesmen will review the past, and\r\ngive to our country a future in accordance with its early history, and\r\npromotive of true liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: These bales were the security for the foreign cotton\r\nbonds, and were seized by the United States Government. Was it not\r\nliable to the bondholders?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: The facts with regard to the Mississippi \"Union Bank\"\r\nbonds may be briefly stated as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of Mississippi required that no law should ever be\r\npassed \"to raise a loan of money on the credit of the State, or to\r\npledge the faith of the State for the payment or redemption of any loan\r\nor debt,\" unless such law should be proposed and adopted by the\r\nLegislature, then published for three months previous to the next\r\nregular election, and finally reënacted by the succeeding Legislature.\r\nThe object was to enable the people of the State to consider the\r\nquestion intelligently, and to indicate and exercise their will upon it\r\nby the election of representatives to the ensuing Legislature, whose\r\nviews upon the subject would be known, and with such instructions,\r\nexpress or implied, as they might think proper to give.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 a law was passed by the Legislature for incorporating the \"Union\r\nBank of Mississippi,\" with a capital of fifteen million five hundred\r\nthousand dollars, \"to be raised by means of a loan to be obtained by the\r\ndirectors of the institution.\" In order to secure this loan, the\r\nstockholders were required to give mortgages on productive and\r\nunencumbered property, to be in all cases of value greater, by a fixed\r\nratio, than the amount of their stock. When the stock had been thus\r\nsecured, as a further guarantee for the redemption of the loan, the\r\nGovernor was directed to issue bonds, in the name and behalf of the\r\nState, equal in amount to the stock secured by mortgage on private\r\nproperty. No bonds as thus directed were ever issued.\r\n\r\nThis act was duly promulgated to the people, and duly reënacted by the\r\nsucceeding Legislature on the 5th of February, 1838, in strict\r\naccordance with the Constitution.\r\n\r\nTen days afterward, however, viz., on the 15th of February, the\r\nLegislature passed an act _supplemental_ to the act chartering the Union\r\nBank, which materially changed or abolished the essential conditions for\r\nthe pledge of the credit of the State. By this supplemental act the\r\nGovernor was instructed, as soon as the books of subscription should be\r\nopened, to \"_subscribe for_, in behalf of the State, fifty thousand\r\n_shares of the stock of the original capital of said bank_, to be paid\r\nfor out of the proceeds of the State bonds to be executed to the said\r\nbank, as already provided for in the said charter.\" This act was passed\r\nin the ordinary mode of legislation, and was not referred, published,\r\nnor reënacted, as prescribed by the Constitution. As soon as the\r\ndirectory was organized and the books of subscription were opened, and\r\nbefore the mortgages required by the charter were executed, the\r\nGovernor, in behalf of the State, subscribed for fifty thousand shares\r\nof the stock, and issued the bonds of the State for five million\r\ndollars, payable to the order of the bank.\r\n\r\nThese bonds were sold to Nicholas Biddle, President of the United States\r\nBank of Pennsylvania, and by him sent to Great Britain as collateral\r\nsecurity for a loan previously made. None of the money received for them\r\nwent into the Treasury of the State of Mississippi, nor was any of it\r\nused for a public improvement. All the consideration ever received by\r\nthe State was its stock in the Union Bank. The bank soon failed, and the\r\nstock became utterly worthless.\r\n\r\nBefore the bonds became due, the Governor of the State had declared them\r\nto be null and void, among other causes, in consequence of the failure\r\nto sell them at par, as required by the \"supplemental act,\" under which\r\nthey were issued.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary here to discuss the question of the validity or\r\nnullity of the bonds. The object is merely to state the principal facts.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were occurring, and until a period several years\r\nsubsequent to their consummation, I, who had just resigned my commission\r\nin the army, was a private citizen, had never held any civil office, and\r\ntook no part in political affairs. Indeed, I have never at any time\r\nbefore, during, or since those events, held any civil office under the\r\nState government, and neither had nor could have had any part in shaping\r\nthe policy of the State. When brought out as a candidate for office, my\r\nnomination was opposed by that section of my party which advocated\r\n\"repudiation,\" on account of my opinions in favor of the payment of the\r\nbonds.\r\n\r\nAs a private citizen, it may be stated that I held that the question of\r\nthe validity of the bonds should be decided by the courts. The\r\nConstitution of Mississippi authorized suit to be brought against the\r\nState in such cases in her own courts, and this I regarded as the proper\r\ncourse to be pursued by the bondholders, holding that the State would be\r\nbound by the judicial decision, if it should sustain the validity of the\r\nclaim. This course, however, was not adopted until long afterward, when\r\nthe question had become complicated with political issues, which\r\nrendered the effort to obtain a settlement entirely nugatory.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a member of the Senate of the United States, my official\r\ninfluence was exerted to promote the objects of a citizen of\r\nMississippi, who, with quasi-credentials from the United States\r\nSecretary of State, Mr. Buchanan, went to London to propose to the\r\nbondholders an arrangement by which the claim, or the greater portion of\r\nit, might be paid by private subscription, on consideration of the\r\ncancellation of the bonds. This effort failed, from a mistaken estimate\r\non the part of some of the principal bondholders, to whom the\r\nproposition was made, of the extent to which State pride would induce\r\nour citizens to contribute, and to the belief in a power to coerce\r\npayment. The gentleman who bore the proposal, indignant at the offensive\r\nmanner of its rejection, and conscious of the disinterestedness of his\r\nmotives, abandoned the negotiation in disgust, and the opportunity was\r\nlost.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n    Military Laws and Measures.--Agricultural Products\r\n    diminished.--Manufactures flourishing.--The Call for\r\n    Volunteers.--The Term of Three Years.--Improved Discipline.--The\r\n    Law assailed.--Important Constitutional Question raised.--Its\r\n    Discussion at Length.--Power of the Government over its own\r\n    Armies and the Militia.--Object of Confederations.--The\r\n    War-Powers granted.--Two Modes of raising Armies in the\r\n    Confederate States.--Is the Law necessary and proper?--Congress\r\n    is the Judge under the Grant of Specific Power.--What is meant\r\n    by Militia.--Whole Military Strength divided into Two\r\n    Classes.--Powers of Congress.--Objections answered.--Good\r\n    Effects of the Law.--The Limitations enlarged.--Results of the\r\n    Operations of these Laws.--Act for the Employment of\r\n    Slaves.--Message to Congress.--\"Died of a Theory.\"--Act to use\r\n    Slaves as Soldiers passed.--Not Time to put it in Operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe agricultural products were diminished every year during the war. Its\r\ndemands diminished the number of cultivators, and their labors were more\r\nextensively devoted to grain-crops. The amount of the cotton-crop was\r\ngreatly reduced, and numbers of bales were destroyed when in danger of\r\nfalling into the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturing industry became more extensive than ever before, and\r\nin many branches more highly developed. The results in the ordnance\r\ndepartment of the Government, stated elsewhere in these pages, serve as\r\nan illustration of the achievements in many branches of industry.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of the war the authority granted to the President\r\nto call for volunteers in the army for a short period was sufficient to\r\nsecure all the military force which we could fit out and use\r\nadvantageously. As it became evident that the contest would be long and\r\nsevere, better measures of preparation were enacted. I was authorized to\r\ncall out and place in the military service for three years, unless the\r\nwar should sooner end, all white men residents of the Confederate States\r\nbetween the ages of eighteen and thirty-five years, and to continue\r\nthose already in the field until three years from the date of their\r\nenlistment. But those under eighteen years and over thirty-five were\r\nrequired to remain ninety days. The existing organization of companies,\r\nregiments, etc., was preserved, but the former were filled up to the\r\nnumber of one hundred and twenty-five men. This was the first step\r\ntoward placing the army in a permanent and efficient condition. The term\r\nof service being lengthened, the changes by discharges and by receiving\r\nrecruits were diminished, so that, while additions were made to the\r\nforces already in the field, the discipline was greatly improved. At the\r\nsame time, on March 13, 1862, General Robert E. Lee was \"charged with\r\nthe conduct of the military operations of the armies of the Confederacy\"\r\nunder my direction. Nevertheless, the law upon which our success so\r\ngreatly depended was assailed with unexpected criticism in various\r\nquarters. A constitutional question of high importance was raised, which\r\ntended to involve the harmony of coöperation, so essential in this\r\ncrisis, between the General and the State governments. It was advanced\r\nprincipally by the Governor of Georgia, Hon. Joseph E. Brown, and the\r\nfollowing extracts are taken from my reply to him, dated\r\n\r\n    Executive Department, Richmond, _May_ 29, 1862.\r\n\r\n    \"I propose, from my high respect for yourself and for other\r\n    eminent citizens who entertain opinions similar to yours, to set\r\n    forth somewhat at length my own views on the power of the\r\n    Confederate Government over its own armies and the militia, and\r\n    will endeavor not to leave without answer any of the positions\r\n    maintained in your letters.\r\n\r\n    \"The main, if not the only, purpose for which independent states\r\n    form unions, or confederations, is to combine the power of the\r\n    several members in such manner as to form one united force in\r\n    all relations with foreign powers, whether in peace or in war.\r\n    Each state, amply competent to administer and control its own\r\n    domestic government, yet too feeble successfully to resist\r\n    powerful nations, seeks safety by uniting with other states in\r\n    like condition, and by delegating to some common agent the use\r\n    of the combined strength of all, in order to secure advantageous\r\n    commercial relations in peace, and to carry on hostilities with\r\n    effect in war.\r\n\r\n    \"Now, the powers delegated by the several States to the\r\n    Confederate Government, which is their common agent, are\r\n    enumerated in the eighth section of the Constitution; each power\r\n    being distinct, specific, and enumerated in paragraphs\r\n    separately numbered. The only exception is the eighteenth\r\n    paragraph, which by its own terms is made dependent on those\r\n    previously enumerated, as follows: '18. To make all laws which\r\n    shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the\r\n    foregoing powers,' etc.\r\n\r\n    \"Now the _war-powers_ granted to the Congress are conferred in\r\n    the following paragraphs: No. 1 'gives authority to raise\r\n    revenue necessary to pay the debts, provide for _the common\r\n    defense_, and carry on the Government,' etc. No. 11, 'To declare\r\n    war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules\r\n    concerning captures on land and water.' No. 12, 'To raise and\r\n    support armies, but no appropriations of money to that use shall\r\n    be for a longer term than two years.' No. 13, 'To provide and\r\n    maintain a navy.' No. 14, 'To make rules for the government and\r\n    regulation of _the land and naval forces_.'\r\n\r\n    \"It is impossible to imagine a more broad, ample, and\r\n    unqualified delegation of the whole war power of each State than\r\n    is here contained, with the solitary limitation of the\r\n    appropriations to two years. The States not only gave power to\r\n    raise money for the common defense, to declare war, to raise and\r\n    support armies (in the plural), to provide and maintain a navy,\r\n    to govern and regulate both land and naval forces, but they went\r\n    further, and covenanted, by the third paragraph of the tenth\r\n    section, not 'to engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in\r\n    such imminent danger as will not admit of delay.'\r\n\r\n    \"I know of but two modes of raising armies within the\r\n    Confederate States, viz., voluntary enlistment and draft, or\r\n    conscription. I perceive, in the delegation of power to raise\r\n    armies, no restriction as to the mode of procuring troops. I see\r\n    nothing which confines Congress to one class of men, nor any\r\n    greater power to receive volunteers than conscripts into its\r\n    service. I see no limitation by which enlistments are to be\r\n    received of individuals only, but not of companies, or\r\n    battalions, or squadrons, or regiments. I find no limitation of\r\n    time of service, but only of duration of appropriation. I\r\n    discover nothing to confine Congress to waging war within the\r\n    limits of the Confederacy, nor to prohibit offensive war. In a\r\n    word, when Congress desires to raise an army, and passes a law\r\n    for that purpose, the solitary question is under the eighteenth\r\n    paragraph, viz., 'Is the law one that is necessary and proper to\r\n    execute the power to raise armies?'\r\n\r\n    \"On this point you say: `But did the necessity exist in this\r\n    case? The conscription act can not aid the Government in\r\n    increasing its supply of _arms_ or _provisions_, but can only\r\n    enable it to call a larger number of men into the field. The\r\n    difficulty has never been to get _men_. The States have already\r\n    furnished the Government more than it can arm,' etc.\r\n\r\n    \"I would have very little difficulty in establishing to your\r\n    entire satisfaction that the passage of the law was not only\r\n    necessary, but that it was absolutely indispensable; that\r\n    numerous regiments of twelve months' men were on the eve of\r\n    being disbanded, whose places could not be supplied by raw\r\n    levies in the face of superior numbers of the foe, without\r\n    entailing the most disastrous results; that the position of our\r\n    armies was so critical as to fill the bosom of every patriot\r\n    with the liveliest apprehension; and that the provisions of this\r\n    law were effective in warding off a pressing danger. But I\r\n    prefer to answer your objection on other and broader grounds.\r\n\r\n    \"I hold that, when a specific power is granted by the\r\n    Constitution, like that now in question, 'to raise armies,'\r\n    Congress is the judge whether the law passed for the purpose of\r\n    executing that power is 'necessary and proper.' It is not enough\r\n    to say that armies might be raised in other ways, and that,\r\n    therefore, this particular way is not 'necessary.' The same\r\n    argument might be used against _every_ mode of raising armies.\r\n    To each successive mode suggested, the objection would be that\r\n    other modes were practicable, and that, therefore, the\r\n    particular mode used was not 'necessary.' The true and only test\r\n    is to inquire whether the law is intended and calculated to\r\n    carry out the object; whether it devises and creates an\r\n    instrumentality for executing the specific power granted; and,\r\n    if the answer be in the affirmative, the law is constitutional.\r\n    None can doubt that the conscription law is calculated and\r\n    intended to 'raise armies'; it is, therefore, 'necessary and\r\n    proper' for the execution of that power, and is constitutional,\r\n    unless it comes in conflict with some other provision of our\r\n    Confederate compact.\r\n\r\n    \"You express the opinion that this conflict exists, and support\r\n    your argument by the citation of those clauses which refer to\r\n    the militia. There are certain provisions not cited by you,\r\n    which are not without influence on my judgment, and to which I\r\n    call your attention. They will aid in defining what is meant by\r\n    'militia,' and in determining the respective powers of the\r\n    States and the Confederacy over them.\r\n\r\n    \"The several States agree 'not to keep troops or ships of war in\r\n    time of peace.'[194] They further stipulate that, 'a\r\n    well-regulated militia being necessary for the security of a\r\n    free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall\r\n    not be infringed.'[195]\r\n\r\n    \"'That no person shall be held to answer for a capital or\r\n    otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment\r\n    of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the _land_ or _naval\r\n    forces_, or in _the militia_ when in actual service in times of\r\n    war or public danger.'[196]\r\n\r\n    \"What, then, are militia? They can only be created by law. The\r\n    arms-bearing inhabitants of a State are liable to become its\r\n    militia, if the law so order; but, in the absence of a law to\r\n    that effect, the men of a State capable of bearing arms are no\r\n    more militia than they are seamen.\r\n\r\n    \"The Constitution also tells us that militia are not _troops_,\r\n    nor are they any part of the _land_ or _naval forces_; for\r\n    militia exist in time of peace, and the Constitution forbids the\r\n    States to keep troops in time of peace, and they are expressly\r\n    distinguished and placed in a separate category from land or\r\n    naval forces in the sixteenth paragraph above quoted; and the\r\n    words _land_ and _naval forces_ are shown by paragraphs 12, 13,\r\n    and 14, to mean the Army and Navy of the Confederate States.\r\n\r\n    \"Now, if militia are not the citizens taken singly, but a body\r\n    created by law; if they are not troops; if they are no part of\r\n    the Army and Navy of the Confederacy, we are led directly to the\r\n    definition, quoted by the Attorney-General, that militia are 'a\r\n    body of soldiers in a State enrolled for discipline.' In other\r\n    words, the term 'militia' is a collective term meaning a body of\r\n    men organized, and can not be applied to the separate\r\n    individuals who compose the organization.\r\n\r\n    \"The Constitution divides the whole military strength of the\r\n    States into only two classes of organized bodies: one, the\r\n    armies of the Confederacy; the other, the militia of the States.\r\n\r\n    \"In the delegation of power to the Confederacy, after exhausting\r\n    the subject of declaring war, raising and supporting armies, and\r\n    providing a navy, in relation to all which the grant of\r\n    authority to Congress is _exclusive_, the Constitution proceeds\r\n    to deal with the other organized body, the militia; and, instead\r\n    of delegating power to Congress alone, or reserving it to the\r\n    States alone, the power is divided as follows, viz.: Congress is\r\n    to have power 'to provide for calling forth the militia to\r\n    execute the laws of the _Confederate_ States, suppress\r\n    insurrections, and _repel invasions_.'[197]\r\n\r\n    \"'To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the\r\n    militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed\r\n    in the service of the Confederate States; _reserving_ to _the\r\n    States respectively the appointment of the officers_, and the\r\n    _authority of training the militia_, according to the discipline\r\n    prescribed by Congress.'[198]\r\n\r\n    \"Congress, then, has the power to provide for _organizing_ the\r\n    arms-bearing people of the State into militia. Each _State_ has\r\n    the power to officer and _train_ them when organized.\r\n\r\n    \"_Congress_ may call forth the militia to execute Confederate\r\n    laws; the _State_ has not surrendered the power to call them\r\n    forth to execute State laws.\r\n\r\n    \"Congress may call them forth to repel invasion; so may the\r\n    State, for the power is impliedly reserved of governing all the\r\n    militia, except the part in actual service of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\n    \"I confess myself at a loss to perceive in what manner these\r\n    careful and well-defined provisions of the Constitution,\r\n    regulating the organization and government of the militia, can\r\n    be understood as applying in the remotest degree to the armies\r\n    of the Confederacy, nor can I conceive how the grant of\r\n    _exclusive_ power to declare and carry on war by armies raised\r\n    and supported by the Confederacy is to be restricted or\r\n    diminished by the clauses which grant a _divided_ power over the\r\n    militia. On the contrary, the delegation of authority over the\r\n    militia, so far as granted, appears to me to be plainly an\r\n    _additional_ enumerated power intended to strengthen the hands\r\n    of the Confederate Government in the discharge of its paramount\r\n    duty, the common defense of the States.\r\n\r\n    \"You state, after quoting the twelfth, fifteenth, and sixteenth\r\n    grants of power to Congress, that 'these grants of power all\r\n    relate to the same subject-matter, and are all contained in the\r\n    same section of the Constitution, and, by a well-known rule of\r\n    construction, must be taken as a whole and construed together.'\r\n\r\n    \"This argument appears to me unsound. _All_ the powers of\r\n    Congress are enumerated in one section, and the three paragraphs\r\n    quoted can no more control each other by reason of their\r\n    location in the same section than they can control any of the\r\n    other paragraphs preceding, intervening, or succeeding. So far\r\n    as the subject-matter is concerned, I have already endeavored to\r\n    show that the armies mentioned in the twelfth paragraph are a\r\n    subject-matter as distinct from the militia mentioned in the\r\n    fifteenth and sixteenth as they are from the navy mentioned in\r\n    the thirteenth. Nothing can so mislead as to construe together,\r\n    and as a whole, the carefully separated clauses which define the\r\n    different powers to be exercised over distinct subjects by the\r\n    Congress.\r\n\r\n    \"But you add that, 'by the grant of power to Congress to raise\r\n    and support armies without qualification, the framers of the\r\n    Constitution intended the regular armies of the Confederacy, and\r\n    not armies composed of the whole militia of all the States.'\r\n\r\n    \"I must confess myself somewhat at a loss to understand this\r\n    position. If I am right that the militia is a body of enrolled\r\n    State soldiers, it is not possible in the nature of things that\r\n    armies raised by the Confederacy can 'be composed of the whole\r\n    militia of all the States.' The militia may be called forth in\r\n    whole or in part into the Confederate service, but do not\r\n    thereby become part of the 'armies raised' by Congress. They\r\n    remain militia, and go home when the emergency which provoked\r\n    their call has ceased. Armies raised by Congress are of course\r\n    raised out of the _same population_ as the militia organized by\r\n    the States, and to deny to Congress the power to draft a citizen\r\n    into the army, or to receive his voluntary offer of services,\r\n    because he is a member of the State militia, is to deny the\r\n    power to raise an army at all; for, practically, all men fit for\r\n    service in the army may be embraced in the militia organization\r\n    of the several States. You seem, however, to suggest, rather\r\n    than directly to assert, that the conscript law may be\r\n    unconstitutional, because it comprehends all arms-bearing men\r\n    between eighteen and thirty-five years; at least, this is an\r\n    inference which I draw from your expression, 'armies composed of\r\n    the _whole_ militia of _all_ the States.' But it is obvious\r\n    that, if Congress have power to draft into the armies raised by\r\n    it any citizens at all (without regard to the fact whether they\r\n    are, or not, members of militia organizations), the power must\r\n    be coextensive with the exigencies of the occasion, or it\r\n    becomes illusory; and the extent of the exigency must be\r\n    determined by Congress; for the Constitution has left the power\r\n    without any other check or restriction than the Executive veto.\r\n    Under ordinary circumstances, the power thus delegated to\r\n    Congress is scarcely felt by the States. At the present moment,\r\n    when our very existence is threatened by armies vastly superior\r\n    in numbers to ours, the necessity for defense has induced a\r\n    call, not for 'the whole militia of all the States,' not for any\r\n    militia, but for men to compose _armies_ for the Confederate\r\n    States.\r\n\r\n    \"Surely there is no mystery in this subject. During our whole\r\n    past history, as well as during our recent one year's experience\r\n    as a new Confederacy, the militia 'have been called forth to\r\n    repel invasion' in numerous instances, and they never came\r\n    otherwise than as bodies organized by the States with their\r\n    company, field, and _general officers_; and, when the emergency\r\n    had passed, they went home again. I can not perceive how any one\r\n    can interpret the conscription law as taking away from the\r\n    States the power to appoint officers to their militia. You\r\n    observe on this point in your letter that, unless your\r\n    construction is adopted, 'the very object of the States in\r\n    reserving the power of appointing the officers is defeated, and\r\n    that portion of the Constitution is not only a nullity, but the\r\n    whole military power of the States, and the entire control of\r\n    the militia, with the appointment of the officers, is vested in\r\n    the Confederate Government, whenever it chooses to call its own\r\n    action \"raising an army,\" and not \"calling forth the militia.\"'\r\n\r\n    \"I can only say, in reply to this, that the power of Congress\r\n    depends on the real nature of the act it proposes to perform,\r\n    not on the name given to it; and I have endeavored to show that\r\n    its action is really that of 'raising an army,' and bears no\r\n    semblance to 'calling forth the militia.' I think I may safely\r\n    venture the assertion that there is not one man out of a\r\n    thousand of those who will do service under the conscription act\r\n    that will describe himself while in the Confederate service as\r\n    being a militiaman; and, if I am right in this assumption, the\r\n    popular understanding concurs entirely with my own deductions\r\n    from the Constitution as to the meaning of the word 'militia.'\r\n\r\n    \"My answer has grown to such a length, that I must confine\r\n    myself to one more quotation from your letter. You proceed:\r\n    'Congress shall have power to _raise armies_. How shall it be\r\n    done? The answer is clear. In conformity to the provisions of\r\n    the Constitution, which expressly provides that, when the\r\n    militia of the States are called forth to _repel invasion_, and\r\n    employed in the service of the Confederate States, which is now\r\n    the case, the State shall appoint the officers.\r\n\r\n    \"I beg you to observe that the answer which you say is clear is\r\n    not an answer to the question put. The question is, How are\r\n    armies to be raised? The answer given is, that, when militia are\r\n    called upon to repel invasion, the State shall appoint the\r\n    officers.\r\n\r\n    \"There seems to me to be a conclusive test on this whole\r\n    subject. By our Constitution, Congress may declare war,\r\n    _offensive_ as well as _defensive_. It may acquire territory.\r\n    Now, suppose that, for good cause and to right unprovoked\r\n    injuries, Congress should declare war against Mexico and invade\r\n    Sonora. The militia could not be called forth in such a case,\r\n    the right to call it being limited 'to repel invasions.' Is it\r\n    not plain that the law now under discussion, if passed under\r\n    such circumstances, could by no possibility be aught else than a\r\n    law to 'raise an army'? Can one and the same law be construed\r\n    into a 'calling forth the militia,' if the war be defensive, and\r\n    a 'raising of armies,' if the war be offensive?\r\n\r\n    \"At some future day, after our independence shall have been\r\n    established, it is no improbable supposition that our present\r\n    enemy may be tempted to abuse his naval power by depredations on\r\n    our commerce, and that we may be compelled to assert our rights\r\n    by offensive war. How is it to be carried on? Of what is the\r\n    army to be composed? If this Government can not call on its\r\n    arms-bearing population otherwise than as militia, and if the\r\n    militia can only be called forth to repel invasion, we should be\r\n    utterly helpless to vindicate our honor or protect our rights.\r\n    War has been well styled 'the terrible litigation of nations.'\r\n    Have we so formed our Government that in this litigation we must\r\n    never be plaintiffs? Surely this can not have been the intention\r\n    of the framers of our compact.\r\n\r\n    \"In no respect in which I can view this law can I find just\r\n    reason to distrust the propriety of my action in approving and\r\n    signing it; and the question presented involves consequences,\r\n    both immediate and remote, too momentous to permit me to leave\r\n    your objections unanswered.\r\n\r\n    \"Jefferson Davis.\"\r\n\r\nThe operation of this law was suspended in the States of Kentucky,\r\nMissouri, and Maryland, because of their occupation by the armies of the\r\nFederal Government. The opposition to it, where its execution was\r\ncontinued, soon became limited, and before June 1st its good effects\r\nwere seen in the increased strength and efficiency of our armies. At the\r\nsame time I was authorized to commission officers to form bands of\r\n\"Partisan Rangers,\" either of infantry or cavalry, which were\r\nsubsequently confined to cavalry alone. On September 27, 1862, all white\r\nmen between the ages of thirty-five and forty-five were placed in the\r\nmilitary service for three years. All persons subject to enrollment\r\nmight be enrolled wherever found, and were made subject to the\r\nprovisions of the law. Authority was also given for the reception of\r\nvolunteers from the States in which the law was suspended. On February\r\n11, 1864, it was enacted by Congress that all white men between the ages\r\nof seventeen and fifty should be in the military service for the war;\r\nalso, that all then in the service between the ages of eighteen and\r\nforty-five should be retained during the war. An enrollment was also\r\nordered of all persons between the ages of seventeen and eighteen and\r\nbetween forty-five and fifty years, who should constitute a reserve for\r\nState defense and detail duty. On February 17th all male free negroes\r\nbetween the ages of eighteen and fifty years were made liable to perform\r\nduties with the army, or in connection with the military defenses of the\r\ncountry in the way of work upon the fortifications, or in Government\r\nworks for the production or preparation of materials of war, or in\r\nmilitary hospitals. The Secretary of War was also authorized to employ\r\nfor the same duties any number of negro slaves not exceeding twenty\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nIn the operation of the military laws we found the exemption from\r\nmilitary duty accorded by the law to all persons engaged in certain\r\nspecified pursuits or professions to be unwise. Indeed, it seems to be\r\nindefensible in theory. The defense of home, family, and country is\r\nuniversally recognized as the paramount political duty of every member\r\nof society; and, in a form of government where each citizen enjoys an\r\nequality of rights and privileges, nothing can be more invidious than an\r\nunequal distribution of duties or obligations. No pursuit nor position\r\nshould relieve any one who is able to do active duty from enrollment in\r\nthe army, unless his functions or services are more useful to the\r\ndefense of his country in another sphere. But the exemption from service\r\nof entire classes should be wholly abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe act of February 17, 1864 (above mentioned), which authorized the\r\nemployment of slaves, produced less results than had been anticipated.\r\nIt, however, brought forward the question of the employment of the\r\nnegroes as soldiers in the army, which was warmly advocated by some and\r\nas ardently opposed by others. My own views upon it were expressed\r\nfreely and frequently in intercourse with members of Congress, and\r\nemphatically in my message of November 7, 1864, when, urging upon\r\nCongress the consideration of the propriety of a radical modification of\r\nthe theory of the law, I said:\r\n\r\n    \"Viewed merely as property, and therefore as the subject of\r\n    impressment, the service or labor of the slave has been\r\n    frequently claimed for short periods in the construction of\r\n    defensive works. The slave, however, bears another relation to\r\n    the state--that of a person. The law of last February\r\n    contemplates only the relation of the slave to the master, and\r\n    limits the impressment to a certain term of service.\r\n\r\n    \"But, for the purposes enumerated in the act, instruction in the\r\n    manner of camping, marching, and packing trains is needful, so\r\n    that even in this limited employment length of service adds\r\n    greatly to the value of the negro's labor. Hazard is also\r\n    encountered in all the positions to which negroes can be\r\n    assigned for service with the army, and the duties required of\r\n    them demand loyalty and zeal.\r\n\r\n    \"In this aspect the relation of person predominates so far as to\r\n    render it doubtful whether the private right of property can\r\n    consistently and beneficially be continued, and it would seem\r\n    proper to acquire for the public service the entire property in\r\n    the labor of the slave, and to pay therefor due compensation,\r\n    rather than to impress his labor for short terms; and this the\r\n    more especially as the effect of the present law would vest this\r\n    entire property in all cases where the slave might be recaptured\r\n    after compensation for his loss had been paid to the private\r\n    owner. Whenever the entire property in the service of a slave is\r\n    thus acquired by the Government, the question is presented by\r\n    what tenure he should be held. Should he be retained in\r\n    servitude, or should his emancipation be held out to him as a\r\n    reward for faithful service, or should it be granted at once on\r\n    the promise of such service; and if emancipated what action\r\n    should be taken to secure for the freed man the permission of\r\n    the State from which he was drawn to reside within its limits\r\n    after the close of his public service? The permission would\r\n    doubtless be more readily accorded as a reward for past faithful\r\n    service, and a double motive for zealous discharge of duty would\r\n    thus be offered to those employed by the Government--their\r\n    freedom and the gratification of the local attachment which is\r\n    so marked a characteristic of the negro and forms so powerful an\r\n    incentive to his action. The policy of engaging to liberate the\r\n    negro on his discharge after service faithfully rendered seems\r\n    to me preferable to that of granting immediate manumission, or\r\n    that of retaining him in servitude. If this policy should\r\n    commend itself to the judgment of Congress, it is suggested\r\n    that, in addition to the duties heretofore performed by the\r\n    slave, he might be advantageously employed as a pioneer and\r\n    engineer laborer, and, in that event, that the number should be\r\n    augmented to forty thousand.\r\n\r\n    \"Beyond this limit and these employments it does not seem to me\r\n    desirable under existing circumstances to go.\r\n\r\n    \"A broad, moral distinction exists between the use of slaves as\r\n    soldiers in defense of their homes and the incitement of the\r\n    same persons to insurrection against their masters. The one is\r\n    justifiable, if necessary, the other is iniquitous and unworthy\r\n    of civilized people; and such is the judgment of all writers on\r\n    public law, as well as that expressed and insisted on by our\r\n    enemies in all wars prior to that now waged against us. By none\r\n    have the practices of which they are now guilty been denounced\r\n    with greater severity than by themselves in the two wars with\r\n    Great Britain, in the last and in the present century, and in\r\n    the Declaration of Independence in 1776, when an enumeration was\r\n    made of the wrongs which justified the revolt from Great\r\n    Britain. The climax of atrocity was deemed to be reached only\r\n    when the English monarch was denounced as having 'excited\r\n    domestic insurrection among us.'\r\n\r\n    \"The subject is to be viewed by us, therefore, solely in the\r\n    light of policy and our social economy. When so regarded, I must\r\n    dissent from those who advise a general levy and arming of the\r\n    slaves for the duty of soldiers. Until our white population\r\n    shall prove insufficient for the armies we require and can\r\n    afford to keep in the field, to employ as a soldier the negro,\r\n    who has merely been trained to labor, and, as a laborer, the\r\n    white man accustomed from his youth to the use of arms, would\r\n    scarcely be deemed wise or advantageous by any; and this is the\r\n    question now before us. But should the alternative ever be\r\n    presented of subjugation, or of the employment of the slave as a\r\n    soldier, there seems no reason to doubt what should then be our\r\n    decision. Whether our view embraces what would, in so extreme a\r\n    case, be the sum of misery entailed by the dominion of the\r\n    enemy, or be restricted solely to the effect upon the welfare\r\n    and happiness of the negro population themselves, the result\r\n    would be the same. The appalling demoralization, suffering,\r\n    disease, and death, which have been caused by partially\r\n    substituting the invaders' system of police for the kind\r\n    relation previously subsisting between the master and slave,\r\n    have been a sufficient demonstration that external interference\r\n    with our institution of domestic slavery is productive of evil\r\n    only. If the subject involved no other consideration than the\r\n    mere right of property, the sacrifices heretofore made by our\r\n    people have been such as to permit no doubt of their readiness\r\n    to surrender every possession in order to secure independence.\r\n    But the social and political question which is exclusively under\r\n    the control of the several States has a far wider and more\r\n    enduring importance than that of pecuniary interest. In its\r\n    manifold phases it embraces the stability of our republican\r\n    institutions, resting on the actual political equality of all\r\n    its citizens, and includes the fulfillment of the task which has\r\n    been so happily begun--that of Christianizing and improving the\r\n    condition of the Africans who have by the will of Providence\r\n    been placed in our charge. Comparing the results of our own\r\n    experience with those of the experiments of others who have\r\n    borne similar relations to the African race, the people of the\r\n    several States of the Confederacy have abundant reason to be\r\n    satisfied with the past, and to use the greatest circumspection\r\n    in determining their course. These considerations, however, are\r\n    rather applicable to the improbable contingency of our need of\r\n    resorting to this element of assistance than to our present\r\n    condition. If the recommendation above, made for the training of\r\n    forty thousand negroes for the service indicated, shall meet\r\n    your approval, it is certain that even this limited number, by\r\n    their preparatory training in intermediate duties, would form a\r\n    more valuable reserve force in case of urgency than threefold\r\n    their number suddenly called from field-labor, while a fresh\r\n    levy could to a certain extent supply their places in the\r\n    special service for which they are now employed.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequent events advanced my views from a prospective to a present need\r\nfor the enrollment of negroes to take their place in the ranks.\r\nStrenuously I argued the question with members of Congress who called to\r\nconfer with me. To a member of the Senate (the House in which we most\r\nneeded a vote) I stated, as I had done to many others, the fact of\r\nhaving led negroes against a lawless body of armed white men, and the\r\nassurance which the experiment gave me that they might, under proper\r\nconditions, be relied on in battle, and finally used to him the\r\nexpression which I believe I can repeat exactly: \"If the Confederacy\r\nfalls, there should be written on its tombstone, 'Died of a theory.'\"\r\nGeneral Lee was brought before a committee to state his opinion as to\r\nthe probable efficiency of negroes as soldiers, and disappointed the\r\nprobable expectation by his unqualified advocacy of the proposed\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nAfter much discussion in Congress, a bill authorizing the President to\r\nask for and accept from their owners such a number of able-bodied negro\r\nmen as he might deem expedient subsequently passed the House, but was\r\nlost in the Senate by one vote. The Senators of Virginia opposed the\r\nmeasure so strongly that only legislative instruction could secure their\r\nsupport of it. Their Legislature did so instruct them, and they voted\r\nfor it. Finally, the bill passed, with an amendment providing that not\r\nmore than twenty-five per cent. of the male slaves between the ages of\r\neighteen and forty-five should be called out. But the passage of the act\r\nhad been so long delayed that the opportunity was lost. There did not\r\nremain time enough to obtain any result from its provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: Article I, section 10, paragraph 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: Ibid., section 9, Part XIII.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: Ibid., section 9, paragraph 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: Section 8, paragraph 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: Ibid., paragraph 16.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIXES.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: There is no Appendix A.]\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B.\r\n\r\nTHE OREGON QUESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nExtracts from speech of Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, February 6, 1846, on the resolution to terminate the\r\njoint occupation of the Oregon Territory.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman: In negotiations between governments, in attempts to modify\r\nexisting policies, the circumstances of the time most frequently decide\r\nbetween success and failure.\r\n\r\nHow far the introduction of this question may affect our foreign\r\nintercourse, the future only can determine; but I invite attention to\r\nthe present posture of affairs. Amicable relations, after a serious\r\ninterruption, have been but recently restored between the United States\r\nand Mexico. The most delicate and difficult of questions, the adjustment\r\nof a boundary between us, remains unsettled; and many eyes are fixed\r\nupon our minister at Mexico, with the hope that he may negotiate a\r\ntreaty which will remove all causes of dispute, and give to us\r\nterritorial limits, the ultimate advantages of which it would be\r\ndifficult to over-estimate.\r\n\r\nIf, sir, hereafter we shall find that, by this excited discussion,\r\nportentous of a war with England, unreasonable demands upon the part of\r\nMexico should be encouraged, the acquisition of California be defeated,\r\nthat key to Asiatic commerce be passed from our hands for ever--what\r\nwill we have gained to compensate so great a loss? We know the influence\r\nwhich Great Britain exercises over Mexico; we should not expect her to\r\nbe passive, nor doubt that the prospect of a war between England and the\r\nUnited States would serve to revive the former hopes and to renew the\r\nrecent enmity of Mexico.\r\n\r\nSir, I have another hope, for the fulfillment of which the signs of the\r\ntimes seem most propitious. An unusually long exemption from a general\r\nwar has permitted the bonds of commerce to extend themselves around the\r\ncivilized world, and nations from remote quarters of the globe have been\r\ndrawn into that close and mutual dependence which foretold unshackled\r\ntrade and a lasting peace. In the East, there appeared a rainbow which\r\npromised that the waters of national jealousy and proscription were\r\nabout to recede from the earth for ever, and the spirit of free trade to\r\nmove over the face thereof.\r\n\r\nIn perspective, we saw the ports of California united to the ports and\r\nforests of Oregon, and our countrymen commanding the trade of the\r\nPacific. The day seemed at hand when the overcharged granaries of the\r\nWest should be emptied to the starving millions of Europe and Asia; when\r\nthe canvas-winged doves of our commerce should freely fly forth from the\r\nark, and return across every sea with the olive of every land. Shall\r\nobjects like these be endangered by the impatience of petty ambition,\r\nthe promptings of sectional interest, or the goadings of fanatic hate?\r\nShall the good of the whole be surrendered to the voracious demands of\r\nthe few? Shall class interests control the great policy of our country,\r\nand the voice of reason be drowned in the clamor of causeless\r\nexcitement? If so, not otherwise, we may agree with him who would\r\nreconcile us to the evils of war by the promise of \"emancipation from\r\nthe manufacturers of Manchester and Birmingham\"; or leave unanswered the\r\nheresy boldly announced, though by history condemned, that war is the\r\npurifier, blood is the aliment, of free institutions. Sir, it is true\r\nthat republics have often been cradled in war, but more often they have\r\nmet with a grave in that cradle. Peace is the interest, the policy, the\r\nnature of a popular government. War may bring benefits to a few, but\r\nprivation and loss are the lot of the many. An appeal to arms should be\r\nthe last resort, and only by national rights or national honor can it be\r\njustified.\r\n\r\nTo those who have treated this as a case involving the national honor, I\r\nreply that, whenever that question shall justly be raised, I trust an\r\nAmerican Congress will not delay for weeks to discuss the chances, or\r\nestimate the sacrifices, which its maintenance may cost. But, sir,\r\ninstead of rights invaded or honor violated, the question before us is,\r\nthe expediency of terminating an ancient treaty, which, if it be unwise,\r\nit can not be dishonorable, to continue. Yet, throughout this long\r\ndiscussion, the recesses and vaulted dome of this hall have reëchoed to\r\ninflammatory appeals and violent declamations on the sanctity of\r\nnational honor; and then, as if to justify them, followed reflections\r\nmost discreditable to the conduct of our Government. The charge made\r\nelsewhere has been repeated here, that we have trodden upon Mexico, but\r\ncowered under England.\r\n\r\nSir, it has been my pride to believe that our history was unstained by\r\nan act of injustice or of perfidy; that we stood recorded before the\r\nworld as a people haughty to the strong, generous to the weak; and\r\nnowhere has this character been more exemplified than in our intercourse\r\nwith Mexico. We have been referred to the treaty of peace that closed\r\nour last war with Great Britain, and told that our injuries were\r\nunredressed, because the question of impressment was not decided. There\r\nare other decisions than those made by commissioners, and sometimes they\r\noutlast the letter of a treaty. On sea and land we settled the question\r\nof impressment before negotiations were commenced at Ghent. Further, it\r\nshould be remembered that there was involved within that question a\r\ncardinal principle of each Government. The power of expatriation, and\r\nits sequence, naturalization, were denied by Great Britain; and hence a\r\nright asserted to impress native-born Britons, though naturalized as\r\ncitizens of the United States. This violated a principle which lies at\r\nthe foundation of our institutions, and could never be permitted; but,\r\nnot being propagandists, we could afford to leave the political opinion\r\nunnoticed, after having taught a lesson which would probably prevent any\r\nfuture attempt to exercise it to our injury. Let the wisdom of that\r\npolicy be judged by subsequent events....\r\n\r\nMr. Davis then proceeded to state and argue at length the historical\r\nquestions involved, making copious citations from original authorities.\r\nHe continued:\r\n\r\nWaiving the consideration of any sinister motive or sectional hate which\r\nmay have brought allies to the support of the resolution now before us,\r\nI will treat it as simply aiming at the object which in common we\r\ndesire--to secure the whole of Oregon to the United States.\r\n\r\nThus considered, the dissolution of the Oregon convention becomes a mere\r\nquestion of time. As a friend to the extension of our Union, and\r\ntherefore prone to insist upon its territorial claims, I have thought\r\nthis movement premature; that we should have put ourselves in the\r\nstrongest attitude for the enforcement of our claims before we fixed a\r\nday on which negotiations should be terminated. That nation negotiates\r\nto most advantage which is best prepared for war. Gentlemen have treated\r\nthe idea of preparation for war as synonymous with the raising of an\r\narmy. It is not so; indeed, that is the last measure, and should only be\r\nresorted to when war has become inevitable; and then a very short time\r\nwill always be, I trust, sufficient. But, sir, there are preparations\r\nwhich require years, and can only be made in a state of peace. Such are\r\nthe fortifications of the salient points and main entrances of our\r\ncoast. For twenty-odd years Southern men have urged the occupation of\r\nthe Tortugas. Are those who have so long opposed appropriations for that\r\npurpose ready to grant them now in such profusion that the labor of\r\nthree years may be done in one? No, sir; the occasion, by increasing the\r\ndemand for money elsewhere, must increase the opposition. That rock,\r\nwhich Nature placed like a sentinel to guard the entrance into the\r\nMediterranean of our continent, and which should be Argus-eyed to watch\r\nit, will stand without an embrasure to look through.\r\n\r\nHow is the case in Oregon? Our settlements there must be protected, and\r\nunder present circumstances an army of operations in that country must\r\ndraw its food from this; but we have not a sufficient navy to keep open\r\na line of communication by sea around Cape Horn; and the rugged route\r\nand the great distance forbid the idea of supplying it by transportation\r\nacross the mountains. Now, let us see what time and the measures more\r\npointedly recommended by the President would effect. Our jurisdiction\r\nextended into Oregon, the route guarded by stockades and troops, a new\r\nimpulse would be given to immigration: and in two or three years the\r\nsettlement on the Willamette might grow into a colony, whose flocks and\r\nherds and granaries would sustain an army, whenever one should be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nBy agencies among the Indian tribes, that effective ally of Great\r\nBritain, which formerly she has not scrupled to employ, would be\r\nrendered friendly to our people. In the mean time, roads could be\r\nconstructed for the transportation of munitions of war. Then we should\r\nbe prepared to assert, and effectively maintain, our claims to their\r\nultimate limits.\r\n\r\nI could not depreciate my countrymen; I would not vaunt the prowess of\r\nan enemy; but, sir, I tell those gentlemen who, in this debate, have\r\nfound it so easy to drive British troops out of Oregon, that, between\r\nEngland and the United States, if hostilities occur in that remote\r\nterritory, the party must succeed which has bread within the country....\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, unfortunately, the opinion has gone forth that no\r\npolitician dares to be the advocate of peace when the question of war is\r\nmooted. That will be an evil hour--the sand of our republic will be\r\nnearly run--when it shall be in the power of any demagogue, or fanatic,\r\nto raise a war-clamor, and control the legislation of the country. The\r\nevils of war must fall upon the people, and with them the war-feeling\r\nshould originate. We, their representatives, are but a mirror to reflect\r\nthe light, and never should become a torch to fire the pile. But, sir,\r\nthough gentlemen go, torch in hand, among combustible materials, they\r\nstill declare there is no danger of a fire. War-speeches and measures\r\nthreatening war are mingled with profuse assurances of peace. Sir, we\r\ncan not expect, we should not require, our adversary to submit to more\r\nthan we would bear; and I ask, after the notice has been given and the\r\ntwelve months have expired, who would allow Great Britain to exercise\r\nexclusive jurisdiction over Oregon? If we would resist such act by force\r\nof arms, before ourselves performing it we should prepare for war.\r\n\r\nSome advocates of this immediate notice have urged their policy by\r\nreference to a resolution of the Democratic Baltimore Convention, and\r\ncontended that the question was thereby closed to members of the\r\nDemocratic party. That resolution does not recommend immediate notice,\r\nbut recommends \"the reannexation of Texas\" and the \"reoccupation of\r\nOregon\" at the \"earliest practicable period.\" The claim is strongly made\r\nto the \"whole of Oregon\"; and the resolution seems directed more\r\npointedly to space than time. Texas and Oregon were united in the\r\nresolution; and, had there been a third question involving our\r\nterritorial extension, I doubt not it would have been united with the\r\nother two. The addition of territory to our Union is part of the\r\nDemocratic faith, and properly was placed in the declaration of our\r\npolicy at that time. To determine whether that practicable period has\r\narrived is now the question; and those who cordially agree upon the\r\nprinciple of territorial enlargement have differed, and may continue\r\nstill to differ, on that question. Sir, though it is demonstrable that\r\nhaste may diminish but can not increase our chances to secure the whole\r\nof Oregon, yet, because Southern men have urged the wisdom of delay, we\r\nhave had injurious comparisons instituted between our conduct on Texas\r\nannexation and Oregon occupation. Is there such equality between the\r\ncases that the same policy must apply to each? Texas was peopled, the\r\ntime was present when it must be acquired, or the influences active to\r\ndefeat our annexation purpose would probably succeed, and the country be\r\nlost to us for ever. Oregon is, with a small exception, still a\r\nwilderness; our claim to ultimate sovereignty can not be weakened during\r\nthe continuance of the Oregon convention. That ill-starred partnership\r\nhas robbed us of the advantages which an early occupation would have\r\ngiven to our people in the fur-trade of the country, and we are now\r\nrapidly advancing to a position from which we can command the entire\r\nTerritory. In Texas annexation we were prompted by other and higher\r\nconsiderations than mere interest. Texas had been a member of our\r\nfamily: in her infancy had been driven from the paternal roof,\r\nsurrendered to the government of harsh, inquisitorial Spain; but, true\r\nto her lineage, preserved the faith of opposition to monarchical\r\noppression. She now returned, and asked to be admitted to the hearth of\r\nthe homestead. She pointed to the band of noble sons who stood around\r\nher and said: \"Here is the remnant of my family; the rest I gave a\r\nsacrifice at the altar of our fathers' God--the God of Liberty.\" One,\r\ntwo, three, of the elder sisters strove hard to close the door upon her;\r\nbut the generous sympathy, the justice of the family, threw it wide\r\nopen, and welcomed her return. Such was the case of Texas; is there a\r\nparallel in Oregon?\r\n\r\nBut who are those that arraign the South, imputing to us motives of\r\nsectional aggrandizement? Generally, the same who resisted Texas\r\nannexation, and now most eagerly press on the immediate occupation of\r\nthe whole of Oregon. The source is worthy the suspicion. These were the\r\nmen whose constitutional scruples resisted the admission of a country\r\ngratuitously offered to us, but who now look forward to gaining Canada\r\nby conquest. These, the same who claim a weight to balance Texas, while\r\nthey attack others as governed by sectional considerations.\r\n\r\nSir, this doctrine of a political balance between different sections of\r\nour Union is not of Southern growth. We advocated the annexation of\r\nTexas as a \"great national measure\"; we saw in it the extension of the\r\nprinciples intrusted to our care; and, if in the progress of the\r\nquestion it assumed a sectional hue, the coloring came from the\r\nopposition that it met--an opposition based, not upon a showing of the\r\ninjury it would bring to them, but upon the supposition that benefits\r\nwould be obtained by us.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that Texas is referred to, and treated as a Southern measure\r\nmerely, though its northern latitude is 42°? And why has the West so\r\noften been reminded of its services upon Texas annexation? Is it to\r\ndivide the South and West? If so, let those who seek this object cease\r\nfrom their travail, for their end can never be obtained. A common\r\nagricultural interest unites us in a common policy, and the hand that\r\nsows seeds of dissension between us will find, if they spring from the\r\nground, that the foot of fraternal intercourse will tread them back to\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe streams that rise in the West flow on and are accumulated into the\r\nrivers of the South; they bear the products of one to the other, and\r\nbind the interests of the whole indissolubly together. The wishes of the\r\none wake the sympathies of the other. On Texas annexation the voice of\r\nMississippi found an echo in the West, and Mississippi reëchoes the call\r\nof the West on the question of Oregon. Though this Government has done\r\nnothing adequate to the defense of Mississippi, though by war she has\r\nmuch to lose and nothing to gain, yet she is willing to encounter it, if\r\nnecessary to maintain our rights in Oregon. Her Legislature has recently\r\nso resolved, and her Governor, in a late message, says, \"If war comes,\r\nto us it will bring blight and desolation, yet we are ready for the\r\ncrisis.\" Sir, could there be a higher obligation on the representative\r\nof such a people than to restrain excitement--than to oppose a policy\r\nthat threatens an unnecessary war?...\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, why have such repeated calls been made upon the South to\r\nrally to the rescue? When, where, or how, has she been laggard or\r\ndeserter?\r\n\r\nIn 1776 the rights of man were violated in the outrages upon the\r\nNorthern colonies, and the South united in a war for their defense. In\r\n1812 the flag of our Union was insulted, our sailors' rights invaded;\r\nand, though the interests infringed were mainly Northern, war was\r\ndeclared, and the opposition to its vigorous prosecution came not from\r\nthe South. We entered it for the common cause, and for the common cause\r\nwe freely met its sacrifices. If, sir, we have not been the \"war party\r\nin peace,\" neither have we been the \"peace party in war,\" and I will\r\nleave the past to answer for the future.\r\n\r\nIf we have not sought the acquisition of provinces by conquest, neither\r\nhave we desired to exclude from our Union such as, drawn by the magnet\r\nof free institutions, have peacefully sought for admission. From sire to\r\nson has descended our federative creed, opposed to the idea of sectional\r\nconflict for private advantage, and favoring the wider expanse of our\r\nunion. If envy and jealousy and sectional strife are eating like rust\r\ninto the bonds our fathers expected to bind us, they come from causes\r\nwhich our Southern atmosphere has never furnished. As we have shared in\r\nthe toils, so we have gloried in the triumphs, of our country. In our\r\nhearts, as in our history, are mingled the names of Concord, and Camden,\r\nand Saratoga, and Lexington, and Plattsburg, and Chippewa, and Erie, and\r\nMoultrie, and New Orleans, and Yorktown, and Bunker Hill. Grouped\r\ntogether, they form a record of the triumphs of our cause, a monument of\r\nthe common glory of our Union. What Southern man would wish it less by\r\none of the Northern names of which it is composed? Or where is he who,\r\ngazing on the obelisk that rises from the ground made sacred by the\r\nblood of Warren, would feel his patriot's pride suppressed by local\r\njealousy? Type of the men, the event, the purpose, it commemorates, that\r\ncolumn rises, stern, even severe in its simplicity; neither niche nor\r\nmolding for parasite or creeping thing to rest on; composed of material\r\nthat defies the waves of time, and pointing like a finger to the source\r\nof noblest thought. Beacon of freedom, it guides the present generation\r\nto retrace the fountain of our years and stand beside its source; to\r\ncontemplate the scene where Massachusetts and Virginia, as stronger\r\nbrothers of the family, stood foremost to defend our common rights; and\r\nremembrance of the petty jarrings of to-day are buried in the nobler\r\nfriendship of an earlier time.\r\n\r\nYes, sir, and when ignorance, led by fanatic hate, and armed by all\r\nuncharitableness, assails a domestic institution of the South, I try to\r\nforgive, for the sake of the righteous among the wicked--our natural\r\nallies, the Democracy of the North. Thus, sir, I leave to silent\r\ncontempt the malign predictions of the member from Ohio, who spoke in\r\nthe early stage of this discussion, while it pleases me to remember the\r\nmanly and patriotic sentiments of the gentleman who sits near me [Mr.\r\nMcDowell], and who represents another portion of that State. In him I\r\nrecognize the feelings of our Western brethren; his were the sentiments\r\nthat accord with their acts in the past, and which, with a few ignoble\r\nexceptions, I doubt not they will emulate, if again the necessity should\r\nexist. Yes, sir, if ever they hear that the invader's foot has been\r\npressed upon our soil, they will descend to the plain like an avalanche,\r\nrushing to bury the foe.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I will say that, free from any forebodings of evil, above\r\nthe influence of taunts, beyond the reach of treasonable threats, and\r\nconfiding securely in the wisdom and patriotism of the Executive, I\r\nshrink from the assertion of no right, and will consent to no\r\nrestrictions on the discretion of the treaty-making power of our\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C.\r\n\r\nSPEECHES, AND EXTRACTS FROM SPEECHES, OF THE AUTHOR IN THE SENATE OF THE\r\nUNITED STATES DURING THE FIRST SESSION OF THE THIRTY-FIRST CONGRESS,\r\n1849-1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeech of Mr. Davis, of Mississippi, in the Senate of the United States,\r\non the resolutions of compromise proposed by Mr. Clay, January 29, 1850:\r\n\r\nI do not rise to continue the discussion, but, as it has been made an\r\nhistorical question as to what the position of the Senate was twelve\r\nyears ago, and, as with great regret I see this, the conservative branch\r\nof the Government, tending toward that fanaticism which seems to prevail\r\nwith the majority in the United States, I wish to read from the journals\r\nof that date the resolutions then adopted, and to show that they went\r\nfurther than the honorable Senator from Kentucky has stated. I take it\r\nfor granted, from the date to which the honorable Senator has alluded,\r\nhe means the resolutions introduced by the honorable Senator from South\r\nCarolina [Mr. Calhoun], not now in his seat, and to which the Senator\r\nfrom Kentucky proposed certain amendments. Of the resolutions introduced\r\nby the Senator from South Carolina, I will read the fifth in the series,\r\nthat to which the honorable Senator from Kentucky must have alluded. It\r\nis in these words:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the intermeddling of any State or States, or their\r\ncitizens, to abolish slavery in the District, or any of the Territories,\r\non the ground, or under the pretext, that it is immoral or sinful, or\r\nthe passage of any act or measure of Congress with that view, would be a\r\ndirect and dangerous attack on the institutions of all the slaveholding\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the general form of the proposition. It was variously modified,\r\nbut never, in my opinion, improved. On the 27th, the fifth resolution\r\nbeing again under consideration, Mr. Clay, of Kentucky, moved to amend\r\nthe amendment by striking out all after the word \"resolved,\" and insert:\r\n\r\n\"That the interference, by the citizens of any of the States, with a\r\nview to the abolition of slavery in this District, is endangering the\r\nrights and security of the people of the District; and that any act or\r\nmeasure of Congress designed to abolish slavery in this District would\r\nbe a violation of the faith implied in the cessions by the States of\r\nVirginia and Maryland; a just cause of alarm to the people of the\r\nslaveholding States, and have a direct and inevitable tendency to\r\ndisturb and endanger the Union.\r\n\r\n\"_And, resolved_, That it would be highly inexpedient to abolish slavery\r\nwithin any district of country set apart for the Indian tribes, where it\r\nnow exists, or in Florida, the only Territory of the United States in\r\nwhich it now exists, because of the serious alarm and just apprehensions\r\nwhich would be thereby excited in the States sustaining that domestic\r\ninstitution; because the people of that Territory have not asked it to\r\nbe done, and, when admitted into the Union, will be exclusively entitled\r\nto decide that question for themselves; because it would be in violation\r\nof the stipulations of the treaty between the United States and Spain of\r\nthe 22d of February, 1819; and, also, because it would be in violation\r\nof a solemn compromise, made at a memorable and critical period in the\r\nhistory of this country, by which, while slavery was prohibited north,\r\nit was admitted south, of the line of thirty-six degrees and thirty\r\nminutes north latitude.\"\r\n\r\nBut this resolution was not finally adopted. Upon the motion of Mr.\r\nBuchanan to amend said amendment, by striking out the second clause\r\nthereof, commencing with the word \"resolved,\" it was determined in the\r\naffirmative, and finally the resolution which here follows was\r\nsubstituted in place of the second clause:\r\n\r\n\"That the interference by the citizens of any of the States, with a view\r\nto the abolition of slavery in this District, is endangering the rights\r\nand security of the people of the District; and that any act or measure\r\nof Congress designed to abolish slavery in this district, would be a\r\nviolation of the faith implied in the cessions by the States of Virginia\r\nand Maryland; a just cause of alarm to the people of the slaveholding\r\nStates, and have a direct and inevitable tendency to disturb and\r\nendanger the Union.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the form in which the resolution was finally adopted, passing\r\nby a vote of thirty-six to eight. Here, then, was fully and broadly\r\nasserted the danger resulting from the interference in the question of\r\nslavery in the District of Columbia, as trenching upon the rights of the\r\nslaveholding States. Twelve years only have elapsed, yet this brief\r\nperiod has swept away even the remembrance of principles then deemed\r\nsacred and necessary to secure the safety of the Union. Now, an\r\nhonorable and distinguished Senator, to whom the country has been\r\ninduced to look for something that would heal the existing dissensions,\r\ninstead of raising new barriers against encroachment, dashes down those\r\nheretofore erected and augments the existing danger. A representative\r\nfrom one of the slaveholding States raises his voice for the first time\r\nin disregard of this admitted right. Nor, Mr. President, did he stop\r\nhere. The boundary of a State, with which we have no more right to\r\ninterfere than with the boundary of the State of Kentucky, is encroached\r\nupon. The United States, sir, as the agent for Texas, had a right to\r\nsettle the question of boundary between Texas and Mexico. Texas was not\r\nannexed as a Territory, but was admitted as a State, and, at the period\r\nof her admission, her boundaries were established by her Congress. She,\r\nby the terms of annexation, gave to the United States the right to\r\ndefine her boundary by treaty with Mexico; but the United States, in the\r\ntreaty made with Mexico subsequent to the war with that country,\r\nreceived from Mexico not merely a cession of the territory that was\r\nclaimed by Texas, but much that lay beyond the asserted limits. Shall\r\nwe, then, acting simply as the cogent of Texas in the settlement of this\r\nquestion of boundary, take from the principal for whom we act that\r\nterritory which belongs to her, to which we asserted her title against\r\nMexico, and appropriate it to ourselves? Why, sir, it would be a\r\nviolation of justice, and of a principle of law which is so plain that\r\nit does not require one to have been bred to the profession of law to\r\nunderstand it. The principle I refer to is, that an agent can not take\r\nfor his own benefit anything resulting from the matter in controversy,\r\nafter having acquired it as belonging to the principal for whom he acts.\r\nThe agent can not appropriate to himself rights acquired for his client.\r\nThe right of Texas, therefore, to that boundary was made complete by the\r\ntreaty of peace, which silenced the only rival claim to the territory.\r\nIt was distinctly defined by the acts of her Congress, before the time\r\nof annexation; and I have only to refer to those acts to show that the\r\nboundary of Texas was the Rio Bravo del Norte, from its mouth to its\r\nsource. What justice, or even decent regard for fairness, can there be,\r\nnow that Texas has acceded to annexation upon certain terms, to propose\r\na change of boundary, in violation of those terms, and by the power we\r\nhold over her as a part of the Union? Can this power extend so far as to\r\ntake from her a portion of her territory, or to assert that there is a\r\nportion to which she is not entitled?\r\n\r\nThese constitute with me two great objections to the propositions of the\r\nhonorable Senator from Kentucky; but, without stating all the objections\r\nthat I have, and they are very many, I will merely point out a few of\r\nthe prominent points to which I object in the argument of the Senator.\r\nHe assumes as facts things which are mere matters of opinion, and, I\r\nthink, of erroneous and injurious opinion. But, deferring the discussion\r\nto another occasion, I desire at present merely to notice the assertion\r\nof the honorable Senator, that slavery would never under any\r\ncircumstances be established in California. This, though stated as a\r\nfact, is but a mere opinion--an opinion with which I do not accord. It\r\nwas to work the gold-mines on this continent that the Spaniards first\r\nbrought Africans to the country. The European races now engaged in\r\nworking the mines of California sink under the burning heat and sudden\r\nchanges of the climate to which the African race are altogether better\r\nadapted. The production of rice, sugar, and cotton, is no better adapted\r\nto slave-labor than the digging, washing, and quarrying of the\r\ngold-mines.\r\n\r\nWe, sir, have not asked that slavery should be established in\r\nCalifornia. We have only asked that there should be no restriction; that\r\nclimate and soil should be left free to establish the institution or\r\nnot, as experience should determine. Sir, after the agitation of the\r\nsubject within these halls and elsewhere has prevented the introduction\r\nof slavery--by preventing the emigration of slaveholders with their\r\nproperty--are we now to be told that the question is settled? More than\r\nthat: when we have acquired territory over which the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States is thereby extended, and which the citizens of the United\r\nStates have a right to occupy, and to establish therein what laws they\r\nplease, in accordance with the principles of the Constitution--in which\r\nthey have a right to establish what institutions they please--it is now\r\nclaimed that the municipal regulations which previously existed shall\r\nstill govern the people, and that a portion of the citizens of the\r\nUnited States shall thus be precluded from going there with their\r\nproperty. This rule has, however, in discussion here, only been applied\r\nto the property of slaveholders; as though slaves were the only property\r\nunder the laws of Mexico prohibited from entering California. It is to\r\nbe remembered that the late Secretary of the Treasury, in a report to\r\nCongress, stated that the Mexican law prohibited the entrance of some\r\nsixty articles of commerce; this was prohibition by law of Congress, and\r\nslavery has never been so prohibited. It never has been prohibited by\r\nthe Mexican Congress in California; and the only prohibition ever issued\r\nwas that contained in the edict of a usurper, under the specious pretext\r\nthat it was necessary, in order to oppose the invasion of the country by\r\nSpain. This decree was recognized by a subsequent Congress, so far as to\r\npass a law authorizing payment for slaves so liberated. It was the\r\nemancipation of all the slaves in Mexico; an act, if you please, of\r\nabolition, not of prohibition; not, whatever construction may be placed\r\nupon it, done in the forms of law and requirements of their\r\nConstitution. But we have not proposed to inquire into the legality of\r\nthe abolition, neither has any Southern man asked that that decree\r\nshould be repealed, or that those liberated under its provisions should\r\nbe returned to slavery. We only claim that there shall be an equality of\r\nimmunities and privileges among citizens of all parts of the United\r\nStates; that Mexican law shall not be applied so as to create inequality\r\nbetween citizens, by preventing the immigration of any.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, we are called on to receive this as a measure of compromise!\r\nIs a measure in which we of the minority are to receive nothing a\r\ncompromise? I look upon it as but a modest mode of taking that, the\r\nclaim to which has been more boldly asserted by others; and, that I may\r\nbe understood upon this question, and that my position may go forth to\r\nthe country in the same columns that convey the sentiments of the\r\nSenator from Kentucky, I here assert that never will I take less than\r\nthe Missouri compromise line extended to the Pacific Ocean, with the\r\nspecific recognition of the right to hold slaves in the territory below\r\nthat line; and that, before such Territories are admitted into the Union\r\nas States, slaves may be taken there from any of the United States at\r\nthe option of their owners. I can never consent to give additional power\r\nto a majority to commit further aggressions upon the minority in this\r\nUnion; and will never consent to any proposition which will have such a\r\ntendency, without a full guarantee or counteracting measure is connected\r\nwith it. I forbear commenting at any further length upon the\r\npropositions embraced in the resolutions at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemarks of Mr. Davis, of Mississippi, in the Senate of the United\r\nStates, on the question of the reception of a memorial from inhabitants\r\nof Pennsylvania and Delaware, presented by Mr. Hale, of New Hampshire,\r\npraying that Congress would adopt measures for an immediate and peaceful\r\ndissolution of the Union. February 8, 1850.\r\n\r\nMr. President: I rise merely to make a few remarks upon the right of\r\npetition, and to notice the error which I think has pervaded the\r\ncomparisons that have been instituted between certain resolutions which\r\nwere presented by the Senator from North Carolina and the petition which\r\nit is now proposed shall be received. The resolutions which were\r\npresented from North Carolina were published in yesterday's paper, and,\r\nafter reading them, I think they refer to a state of case which the\r\npeople of North Carolina might properly present as their grievance. They\r\nwere resolutions for preserving the Union, calling upon Congress to take\r\nall measures in its power for that purpose. This was all legitimate.\r\nThey had a right to petition Congress for a redress of grievances; and,\r\nif it were in our power to redress those grievances, if it were within\r\nthe legitimate functions of our legislation, we were bound to receive\r\nthe petition and respectfully consider it. This case is exactly the\r\nreverse. Here is no grievance, unless the Union is a grievance to those\r\nwho petition. And they call upon Congress to do that which every one\r\nmust admit Congress has no power to do--to dissolve peaceably the union\r\nof the States. Then, sir, in the first place, there is no grievance; in\r\nthe next place, there is no power; and, beyond all that, it is offensive\r\nto the Senate. It is offensive to recommend legislation for the\r\ndissolution of the Union--offensive to the Senate and to the whole\r\ncountry. If this Union is ever to be dissolved, it must be by the action\r\nof the States and their people. Whatever power Congress holds, it bolds\r\nunder the Constitution, and that power is but a part of the Union.\r\nCongress has no power to legislate upon that which will be the\r\ndestruction of the whole foundation upon which its authority rests.\r\n\r\nI recollect, a good many years ago, that the Senator from Massachusetts\r\n[Mr. John Davis], who addressed the Senate this morning, very pointedly\r\ndescribed the right of petition as a very humble right--as the mere\r\nright to beg. This is my own view. The right peaceably to assemble, I\r\nhold as the right which it was intended to grant to the people; that was\r\nthe only right which had ever been denied in our colonial condition. The\r\nright of petition had never been denied by Parliament. It was intended\r\nonly to secure to the people, I say, the right peaceably to assemble,\r\nwhenever they choose to do so, with intent to petition for a redress of\r\ngrievances.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, the right of petition, though but a poor right--the mere right\r\nto beg--may yet be carried to such an extent that we are bound to abate\r\nit as a nuisance. If the avenues to the Capitol were to be obstructed,\r\nso that members would find themselves unable to reach the halls of\r\nlegislation, because hordes of beggars presented themselves in the way\r\ncalling for relief, it would be a nuisance that would require to be\r\nabated, and Congress, in self-defense, would be compelled to remove\r\nthem. But such a collection of beggars would not be half so great an\r\nevil as the petitions presented here on the subject of slavery. They\r\ndisturb the peace of the country; they impede and pervert legislation by\r\nthe excitement they create; they do more to prevent rational\r\ninvestigation and proper action in this body than any, if not all, other\r\ncauses. Good, if ever designed, has never resulted, and it would be\r\ndifficult to suppose that good is expected ever to flow from them. Why,\r\nthen, should we be bound to receive such petitions to the detriment of\r\nthe public business; or, rather, why are they presented? I am not of\r\nthose who believe we should be turned from the path of duty by\r\nout-of-door clamor, or that the evil can be removed by partial\r\nconcession. To receive is to give cause for further demands, and our\r\ndirect and safe course is rejection.\r\n\r\nYes, sir, their reception would serve only to embarrass Congress, to\r\ndisturb the tranquillity of the country, and to peril the Union of the\r\nStates. By every obligation, therefore, that rests upon us under the\r\nConstitution, upon every great principle upon which the Constitution is\r\nfounded, we are bound to abate this as a great and growing evil. This\r\npetition, sir, was well described by the Senator from Pennsylvania as\r\nbeing spurious; and I have been assured of the fact, from other sources\r\nof information, that petitions are sent round in reference to other\r\nsubjects--of temperance, generally--and, after a long list of names has\r\nbeen obtained, the caption is cut off, and the list of signatures\r\nattached to an abolition caption and sent here to excite one section of\r\nthe Union against the other, to disturb the country, and distract the\r\nlegislation of Congress, to execute which we have our seats in this\r\nChamber. For the reasons first stated, I voted to receive the\r\nresolutions that were presented by the Senator from North Carolina, and\r\nfor the reasons I have just given shall vote to reject this petition.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion of speech of Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, in the Senate\r\nof the United States, on the resolutions of Mr. Clay, relative to\r\nslavery in the Territories, etc., February 13 and 14, 1850.\r\n\r\n... Sir, it has been asked on several occasions during the present\r\nsession, What ground of complaint has the South? Is this agitation in\r\nthe two halls of Congress, in relation to the domestic institutions of\r\nthe South, no subject for complaint? Is the denunciation heaped upon us\r\nby the press of the North, and the attempts to degrade us in the eyes of\r\nChristendom--to arraign the character of our people and the character of\r\nour fathers, from whom our institutions are derived--no subject for\r\ncomplaint? Is this sectional organization, for the purpose of hostility\r\nto our portion of the Union, no subject for complaint? Would it not,\r\nbetween foreign nations--nations not bound together and restrained as we\r\nare by compact--would it not, I say, be just cause for war? What\r\ndifference is there between organizations for circulating incendiary\r\ndocuments and promoting the escape of fugitives from a neighboring State\r\nand the organization of an armed force for the purpose of invasion? Sir,\r\na State relying securely on its own strength would rather court the open\r\ninvasion than the insidious attack. And for what end, sir, is all this\r\naggression? They see that the slaves in their present condition in the\r\nSouth are comfortable and happy; they see them advancing in\r\nintelligence; they see the kindest relations existing between them and\r\ntheir masters; they see them provided for in age and sickness, in\r\ninfancy and in disability; they see them in useful employment,\r\nrestrained from the vicious indulgences to which their inferior nature\r\ninclines them; they see our penitentiaries never filled, and our\r\npoor-houses usually empty. Let them turn to the other hand, and they see\r\nthe same race in a state of freedom at the North; but, instead of the\r\ncomfort and kindness they receive at the South, instead of being happy\r\nand useful, they are, with few exceptions, miserable, degraded, filling\r\nthe penitentiaries and poor-houses, objects of scorn, excluded in some\r\nplaces from the schools, and deprived of many other privileges and\r\nbenefits which attach to the white men among whom they live. And yet\r\nthey insist that elsewhere an institution which has proved beneficial to\r\nthis race shall be abolished, that it may be substituted by a state of\r\nthings which is fraught with so many evils to the race which they claim\r\nto be the object of their solicitude! Do they find in the history of St.\r\nDomingo, and in the present condition of Jamaica, under the recent\r\nexperiments which have been made upon the institution of slavery in the\r\nliberation of the blacks, before God, in his wisdom, designed it should\r\nbe done--do they there find anything to stimulate them to future\r\nexertion in the cause of abolition? Or should they not find there\r\nsatisfactory evidence that their past course was founded in error? And\r\nis it not the part of integrity and wisdom, as soon as they can, to\r\nretrace their steps? Should they not immediately cease from a course\r\nmischievous in every stage, and finally tending to the greatest\r\ncatastrophe? We may dispute about measures, but, as long as parties have\r\nnationality, as long as it is a difference of opinion between\r\nindividuals passing into every section of the country, it threatens no\r\ndanger to the Union. If the conflicts of party were the only cause of\r\napprehension, this Government might last for ever--the last page of\r\nhuman history might contain a discussion in the American Congress upon\r\nthe meaning of some phrase, the extent of the power conferred by some\r\ngrant of the Constitution. It is, sir, these sectional divisions which\r\nweaken the bonds of union and threaten their final rupture. It is not\r\ndifferences of opinion--it is geographical lines, rivers and\r\nmountains--which divide State from State, and make different nations of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nAre these no subjects of complaint for us? And do they furnish no cause\r\nfor repentance to you? Have we not a right to appeal to you as brethren\r\nof this Union? Have we not a right to appeal to you, as brethren bound\r\nby the compact of our fathers, that you should, with due regard to your\r\nown rights and interests and constitutional obligations, do all that is\r\nnecessary to preserve our peace and promote our prosperity?\r\n\r\nIf, sir, the seeds of disunion have been sown broadcast over this land,\r\nI ask by whose hand they have been scattered? If, sir, we are now\r\nreduced to a condition when the powers of this Government are held\r\nsubservient to faction; if we can not and dare not legislate for the\r\norganization of territorial governments--I ask, sir, who is responsible\r\nfor it? And I can with proud reliance say, it is not the South--it is\r\nnot the South! Sir, every charge of disunion which is made on that part\r\nof the South which I in part represent, and whose sentiments I well\r\nunderstand, I here pronounce to be grossly calumnious. The conduct of\r\nthe State of Mississippi in calling a convention has already been\r\nintroduced before the Senate; and on that occasion I stated, and now\r\nrepeat, that it was the result of patriotism, and a high resolve to\r\npreserve, if possible, our constitutional Union; that all its\r\nproceedings were conducted with deliberation, and it was composed of the\r\nfirst men of the State.\r\n\r\nThe Chief-Justice--a man well known for his high integrity, for his\r\npowerful intellect, for his great legal attainments, and his ability in\r\nquestions of constitutional law-presided over that Convention. After\r\ncalm and mature deliberation, resolutions were adopted, not in the\r\nspirit of disunion, but announcing, in the first resolution of the\r\nseries, their attachment to the Union. They call on their brethren of\r\nthe South to unite with them in their holy purpose of preserving the\r\nConstitution, which is its only bond and reliable hope. This was their\r\nobject; and for this and for no other purpose do they propose to meet in\r\ngeneral convention at Nashville. As I stated on a former occasion, this\r\nwas not a party movement in Mississippi. The presiding officer belongs\r\nto the political minority in the State; the two parties in the State\r\nwere equally represented in the numbers of the Convention, and its\r\ndeliberations assumed no partisan or political character whatever. It\r\nwas the result of primary meetings in the counties; an assemblage of men\r\nknown throughout the State, having first met and intimated to those\r\ncounties a time when the State Convention should, if deemed proper, be\r\nheld. Every movement was taken with deliberation, and every movement\r\nthen taken was wholly independent of the action of anybody else; unless\r\nit be intended, by the remarks made here, to refer its action to the\r\ngreat principles of those who have gone before us, and who have left us\r\nthe rich legacy of the free institutions under which we live. If it be\r\nattempted to assign the movement to the nullification tenets of South\r\nCarolina, as my friend near me seemed to understand, then I say you must\r\ngo further back, and impute it to the State rights and strict-\r\nconstruction doctrines of Madison and Jefferson. You must refer these in\r\ntheir turn to the principles in which originated the Revolution and\r\nseparation of these then colonies from England. You must not stop there,\r\nbut go back still further, to the bold spirit of the ancient barons of\r\nEngland. That spirit has come down to us, and in that spirit has all the\r\naction since been taken. We will not permit aggressions. We will defend\r\nour rights; and, if it be necessary, we will claim from this Government,\r\nas the barons of England claimed from John, the grant of another _Magna\r\nCharta_ for our protection.\r\n\r\nSir, I can but consider it as a tribute of respect to the character for\r\ncandor and sincerity which the South maintains, that every movement\r\nwhich occurs in the Southern States is closely scrutinized, and the\r\nassertion of a determination to maintain their constitutional rights is\r\ndenounced as a movement of disunion; while violent denunciations against\r\nthe Union are now made, and for years have been made, at the North by\r\nassociations, by presses and conventions, yet are allowed to pass\r\nunnoticed as the idle wind--I suppose for the simple reason that nobody\r\nbelieved there was any danger in them. It is, then, I say, a tribute\r\npaid to the sincerity of the South, that every movement of hers is\r\nwatched with such jealousy; but what shall we think of the love for the\r\nUnion of those in whom this brings us corresponding change of conduct,\r\nwho continue the wanton aggravations which have produced and justify the\r\naction they deprecate? Is it well, is it wise, is it safe, to disregard\r\nthese manifestations of public displeasure, though it be the displeasure\r\nof a minority? Is it proper, or prudent, or respectful, when a\r\nrepresentative, in accordance with the known will of his constituents,\r\naddresses you the language of solemn warning, in conformity to his duty\r\nto the Constitution, the Union, and to his own conscience, that his\r\ncourse should be arraigned as the declaration of ultra and dangerous\r\nopinions? If these warnings were received in the spirit in which they\r\nare given, it would augur better for the country. It would give hopes\r\nwhich are now denied us, if the press of the country, that great lever\r\nof public opinion, would enforce these warnings, and bear them to every\r\ncottage, instead of heaping abuse upon those whose love of ease would\r\nprompt them to silence--whose speech, therefore, is evidence of\r\nsincerity. Lightly and loosely, representatives of Southern people have\r\nbeen denounced as disunionists by that portion of the Northern press\r\nwhich most disturbs the harmony and endangers the perpetuity of the\r\nUnion. Such, even, has been my own case, though the man does not breathe\r\nat whose door the charge of disunion might not as well be laid as at\r\nmine. The son of a Revolutionary soldier, attachment to this Union was\r\namong the first lessons of my childhood; bred to the service of my\r\ncountry, from boyhood to mature age, I wore its uniform. Through the\r\nbrightest portion of my life I was accustomed to see our flag, historic\r\nemblem of the Union, rise with the rising and fall with the setting sun.\r\nI look upon it now with the affection of early love, and seek to\r\npreserve it by a strict adherence to the Constitution, from which it had\r\nits birth, and by the nurture of which its stars have come so much to\r\noutnumber its original stripes. Shall that flag, which has gathered\r\nfresh glory in every war, and become more radiant still by the conquest\r\nof peace--shall that flag now be torn by domestic faction, and trodden\r\nin the dust by sectional rivalry? Shall we of the South, who have shared\r\nequally with you all your toils, all your dangers, all your adversities,\r\nand who equally rejoice in your prosperity and your fame--shall we be\r\ndenied those benefits guaranteed by our compact, or gathered as the\r\ncommon fruits of a common country? If so, self-respect requires that we\r\nshould assert them; and, as best we may, maintain that which we could\r\nnot surrender without losing your respect as well as our own.\r\n\r\nIf, sir, this spirit of sectional aggrandizement--or, if gentlemen\r\nprefer, this love they bear the African race--shall cause the disunion\r\nof these States, the last chapter of our history will be a sad\r\ncommentary upon the justice and the wisdom of our people. That this\r\nUnion, replete with blessings to its own citizens, and diffusive of hope\r\nto the rest of mankind, should fall a victim to a selfish aggrandizement\r\nand a pseudo-philanthropy, prompting one portion of the Union to war\r\nupon the domestic rights and peace of another, would be a deep\r\nreflection on the good sense and patriotism of our day and generation.\r\nBut, sir, if this last chapter in our history shall ever be written, the\r\nreflective reader will ask, Whence proceeded this hostility of the North\r\nagainst the South? He will find it there recorded that the South, in\r\nopposition to her own immediate interests, engaged with the North in the\r\nunequal struggle of the Revolution. He will find again, that, when\r\nNorthern seamen were impressed, their brethren of the South considered\r\nit cause for war, and entered warmly into the contest with the haughty\r\npower then claiming to be mistress of the seas. He will find that the\r\nSouth, afar off, unseen and unheard, toiling in the pursuits of\r\nagriculture, had filled the shipping and supplied the staple for\r\nmanufactures, which enriched the North. He will find that she was the\r\ngreat consumer of Northern fabrics--that she not only paid for these\r\ntheir fair value in the markets of the world, but that she also paid\r\ntheir increased value, derived from the imposition of revenue duties.\r\nAnd, if, still further, he seeks for the cause of this hostility, it at\r\nlast is to be found in the fact that the South held the African race in\r\nbondage, being the descendants of those who were mainly purchased from\r\nthe people of the North. And this was the great cause. For this the\r\nNorth claimed that the South should be restricted from future\r\ngrowth--that around her should be drawn, as it were, a sanitary cordon\r\nto prevent the extension of a \"moral leprosy\"; and, if for that it shall\r\nbe written that the South resisted, it would be but in keeping with\r\nevery page she has added to the history of our country.\r\n\r\nIt depends on those in the majority to say whether this last chapter in\r\nour history shall be written or not. It depends on them now to decide\r\nwhether the strife between the different sections shall be arrested\r\nbefore it has become impossible, or whether it shall proceed to a final\r\ncatastrophe. I, sir--and I only speak for myself--am willing to meet any\r\nfair proposition--to settle upon anything which promises security for\r\nthe future; anything which assures me of permanent peace, and I am\r\nwilling to make whatever sacrifice I may properly be called on to render\r\nfor that purpose. Nor, sir, is it a light responsibility. If I strictly\r\nmeasured my conduct by the late message of the Governor, and the recent\r\nexpressions of opinion in my State, I should have no power to accept any\r\nterms save the unqualified admission of the equal rights of the citizens\r\nof the South to go into any of the Territories of the United States with\r\nany and every species of property held among us. I am willing, however,\r\nto take my share of the responsibility which the crisis of our country\r\ndemands. I am willing to rely on the known love of the people I\r\nrepresent for the whole country, and the abiding respect which I know\r\nthey entertain for the Union of these States. If, sir, I distrusted\r\ntheir attachment to our Government, and if I believed that they had that\r\nrestless spirit of disunion which has been ascribed to the South, I\r\nshould know full well that I had no such foundation as this to rely\r\nupon--no such great reserve in the heart of the people to fall back upon\r\nin the hour of accountability.\r\n\r\nMr. President, is there such incompatibility of interest between the two\r\nsections of this country that they can not profitably live together?\r\nDoes the agriculture of the South injure the manufactures of the North?\r\nOn the other hand, are they not their life-blood? And think you, if one\r\nportion of the Union, however great it might be in commerce and\r\nmanufactures, was separated from all the agricultural districts, that it\r\nwould long maintain its supremacy? If any one so believes, let him turn\r\nto the written history of commercial states: let him look upon the\r\nmoldering palaces of Venice; let him ask for the faded purple of Tyre,\r\nand visit the ruins of Carthage; there he will see written the fate of\r\nevery country which rests its prosperity on commerce and manufactures\r\nalone. United we have grown to our present dignity and power--united we\r\nmay go on to a destiny which the human mind cannot measure. Separated, I\r\nfeel that it requires no prophetic eye to see that the portion of the\r\ncountry which is now scattering the seeds of disunion to which I have\r\nreferred will be that which will suffer most. Grass will grow on the\r\npavements now worn by the constant tread of the human throng which waits\r\non commerce, and the shipping will abandon your ports for those which\r\nnow furnish the staples of trade. And we who produce the great staples\r\nupon which your commerce and manufactures rest, we will produce those\r\nstaples still; shipping will fill our harbors; and why may we not found\r\nthe Tyre of modern commerce within our own limits? Why may we not bring\r\nthe manufacturers to the side of agriculture, and commerce, too, the\r\nready servant of both?\r\n\r\nBut, sir, I have no disposition to follow this subject. I certainly can\r\nderive no pleasure from the contemplation of anything which can impair\r\nthe prosperity of any portion of this Union; and I only refer to it that\r\nthose who suppose we are tied by interest or fear should look the\r\nquestion in the face and understand that it is mainly a feeling of\r\nattachment to the Union which has long bound, and now binds, the South.\r\nBut, Mr. President, I ask Senators to consider how long affection can be\r\nproof against such trial, and injury, and provocation, as the South is\r\ncontinually receiving.\r\n\r\nThe case in which this discrimination against the South is attempted,\r\nthe circumstances under which it was introduced, render it especially\r\noffensive. It will not be difficult to imagine the feeling with which a\r\nSouthern soldier during the Mexican war received the announcement that\r\nthe House of Representatives had passed that odious measure, the Wilmot\r\nProviso; and that he, although then periling his life, abandoning all\r\nthe comforts of home, and sacrificing his interests, was, by the\r\nLegislature of his country, marked as coming from a portion of the Union\r\nwhich was not entitled to the equal benefits of whatever might result\r\nfrom the service to which he was contributing whatever power he\r\npossessed. Nor will it be difficult to conceive, of the many sons of the\r\nSouth whose blood has stained those battle-fields, whose ashes now\r\nmingle with Mexican earth, that some, when they last looked on the flag\r\nof their country, may have felt their dying moments embittered by the\r\nrecollection that that flag cast not an equal shadow of protection over\r\nthe land of their birth, the graves of their parents, and the homes of\r\ntheir children, so soon to be orphans. Sir, I ask Northern Senators to\r\nmake the case their own--to carry to their own firesides the idea of\r\nsuch intrusion and offensive discrimination as is offered to us--realize\r\nthese irritations, so galling to the humble, so intolerable to the\r\nhaughty, and wake, before it is too late, from the dream that the South\r\nwill tamely submit. Measure the consequences to us of your assumption,\r\nand ask yourselves whether, as a free, honorable, and brave people, you\r\nwould submit to it?\r\n\r\nIt is essentially the characteristic of the chivalrous that they never\r\nspeculate upon the fears of any man, and I trust that no such\r\nspeculations will be made upon the idea that may be entertained in any\r\nquarter that the South, from fear of her slaves, is necessarily opposed\r\nto a dissolution of the Union. She has no such fear; her slaves would be\r\nto her now, as they were in the Revolution, an element of military\r\nstrength. I trust that no speculations will be made upon either the\r\ncondition or the supposed weakness of the South. They will bring sad\r\ndisappointments to those who indulge them. Rely upon her devotion to the\r\nUnion, rely upon the feeling of fraternity she inherited and has never\r\nfailed to manifest; rely upon the nationality and freedom from sedition\r\nwhich have in all ages characterized an agricultural people; give her\r\njustice, sheer justice, and the reliance will never fail you.\r\n\r\nThen, Mr. President, I ask that some substantial proposition may be made\r\nby the majority in regard to this question. It is for those who have the\r\npower to pass it to propose one. It is for those who are threatening us\r\nwith the loss of that which we are entitled to enjoy, to state, if there\r\nbe any compromise, what that compromise is. We are unable to pass any\r\nmeasure, if we propose it; therefore I have none to suggest. We are\r\nunable to bend you to any terms which we may offer; we are under the ban\r\nof your purpose: therefore from you, if from anywhere, the proposition\r\nmust come. I trust that we shall meet it, and bear the responsibility as\r\nbecomes us; that we shall not seek to escape from it; that we shall not\r\nseek to transfer to other places, or other times, or other persons, that\r\nresponsibility which devolves upon us; and I hope the earnestness which\r\nthe occasion justifies will not be mistaken for the ebullition of\r\npassion, nor the language of warning be construed as a threat. We\r\ncannot, without the most humiliating confession of the supremacy of\r\nfaction, evade our constitutional obligations, and our obligations under\r\nthe treaty with Mexico to organize governments in the Territories of\r\nCalifornia and New Mexico. I trust that we will not seek to escape from\r\nthe responsibility, and leave the country unprovided for, unless by an\r\nirregular admission of new States; that we will act upon the good\r\nexample of Washington in the case of Tennessee, and of Jefferson in the\r\ncase of Louisiana; that we will not, if we abandon those high standards,\r\ndo more than come down to modern examples; that we will not go further\r\nthan to permit those who have the forms of government, under the\r\nConstitution, to assume sovereignty over territory of the United States;\r\nthat we may at least, I say, assert the right to know who they are, how\r\nmany they are--where they voted, how they voted--and whose certificate\r\nis presented to us of the fact, before it is conceded to them to\r\ndetermine the fundamental law of the country, and to prescribe the\r\nconditions on which other citizens of the United States may enter it. To\r\nreach all this knowledge, we must go through the intermediate stage of\r\nterritorial government.\r\n\r\nHow will you determine what is the seal, and who are the officers, of a\r\ncommunity unknown as an organized body to the Congress of the United\r\nStates? Can the right be admitted in that community to usurp the\r\nsovereignty over territory which belongs to the States of the Union? All\r\nthese questions must be answered before I can consent to any such\r\nirregular proceeding as that which is now presented in the case of\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nMr. President, thanking the Senate for the patience they have shown\r\ntoward me, I again express the hope that those who have the power to\r\nsettle this distracting question--those who have the ability to restore\r\npeace, concord, and lasting harmony to the United States--will give us\r\nsome substantial proposition, such as magnanimity can offer, and such as\r\nwe can honorably accept. I, being one of the minority in the Senate and\r\nthe Union, have nothing to offer, except an assurance of coöperation in\r\nanything which my principles will allow me to adopt, and which promises\r\npermanent, substantial security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeech of Mr. Davis, of Mississippi, in the Senate of the United States\r\n(chiefly in answer to Mr. Fessenden, of Maine, on the message of the\r\nPresident of the United States transmitting to Congress the \"Lecompton\r\nConstitution\" of Kansas), February 8, 1858:\r\n\r\nI wish to express not only my concurrence with the message of the\r\nPresident, but my hearty approbation of the high motive which actuated\r\nhim when he wrote it. In that paper breathes the sentiment of a patriot,\r\nand it stands out in bold contrast with the miserable slang by which he\r\nwas pursued this morning. It may serve the purposes of a man who little\r\nregards the Union to perpetrate a joke on the hazard of its dissolution.\r\nIt may serve the purpose of a man who never looks to his own heart to\r\nfind there any impulses of honor, to arraign everybody, the President\r\nand the Supreme Court, and to have them impeached and vilified on his\r\nmere suspicion. It ill becomes such a man to point to Southern\r\ninstitutions as to him a moral leprosy, which he is to pursue to the end\r\nof extermination, and, perverting everything, ancient and modern, to\r\nbring it tributary to his own malignant purposes. Not even could that\r\nclause of the Constitution which refers to the importation or migration\r\nof persons be held up to public consideration by the Senator [Mr.\r\nFessenden] in a studied argument, save as a permission for the\r\nslave-trade. Then, everything that is most prominent in relation to the\r\nprotection of property in that instrument he holds to have been swept\r\naway by a statute which prohibited the further importation of Africans.\r\nThe language of that clause of the Constitution is far broader than the\r\nimportation of Africans. It is not confined or limited at all to that\r\nsubject. It says:\r\n\r\n\"The migration or importation of such persons as any of the States now\r\nexisting shall think proper to admit shall not be prohibited by the\r\nCongress prior to the year 1808, but a tax or duty may be imposed on\r\nsuch importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person.\"\r\n\r\nThat was a power given to Congress far broader than the slave-trade; and\r\nyet the Senator gravely argues that, when that prohibition against the\r\nfurther importation of Africans took place by act of Congress,\r\nthenceforward the constitutional shield, which had been thrown over\r\nslave property, fell. Sir, it is the only private property in the United\r\nStates which is specifically recognized in the Constitution and\r\nprotected by it.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when there was a higher and holier sentiment among the\r\nmen who represented the people of this country. As far back as the time\r\nof the Confederation, when no narrow, miserable prejudice between\r\nNorthern and Southern men governed those who ruled the States, a\r\ncommittee of three, two of whom were Northern men, reporting upon what\r\nthey considered the bad faith of Spain in Florida, in relation to\r\nfugitive slaves, proposed that negotiations should be instituted to\r\nrequire Spain to surrender, as the States did then surrender, all\r\nfugitives escaped into their limits. Hamilton and Sedgwick from the\r\nNorth, and Madison from the South, made that report--men, the loftiness\r\nof whose purpose and genius might put to shame the puny efforts now made\r\nto disturb that which lies at the very foundation of the Government\r\nunder which we live.\r\n\r\nA man not knowing into what presence he was introduced, coming into this\r\nChamber, might, for a large part of this session, have supposed that\r\nhere stood the representatives of belligerent States, and that, instead\r\nof men assembled here to confer together for the common welfare, for the\r\ngeneral good, he saw here ministers from States preparing to make war\r\nupon each other; and then he would have felt that vain, indeed, was the\r\nvaunting of the prowess of one to destroy another. Or if, sir, he had\r\nknown more--if he had recognized the representatives of the States of\r\nthe Union--still he would have traced through this same eternal, petty\r\nagitation about sectional success, that limit which can not fail,\r\nhowever the Senator from New York (Mr. Seward) may regret it, to bring\r\nabout a result which every man should, from his own sense of honor,\r\nfeel, when he takes his seat in this Chamber, that he is morally bound\r\nto avoid as long as he retains possession of his seat.\r\n\r\nTo express myself more distinctly: I hold that a Senator, while he sits\r\nhere as the representative of a State in the Federal Government, is in\r\nthe relation of a minister to a friendly court, and that the moment he\r\nsees this Government in hostility to his own, the day he resolves to\r\nmake war on this Government, his honor and the honor of his State compel\r\nhim to vacate the seat he holds.\r\n\r\nIt is a poor evasion for any man to say: \"I make war on the rights of\r\none whole section; I make war on the principles of the Constitution; and\r\nyet, I uphold the Union, and I desire to see it protected.\" Undermine\r\nthe foundation, and still pretend that he desires the fabric to stand!\r\nCommon sense rejects it. No one will believe the man who makes the\r\nassertion, unless he believes him under the charitable supposition that\r\nhe knows not what he is doing.\r\n\r\nSir, we are arraigned, day after day, as the aggressive power. What\r\nSouthern Senator, during this whole session, has attacked any portion,\r\nor any interest, of the North? In what have we now, or ever, back to the\r\nearliest period of our history, sought to deprive the North of any\r\nadvantage it possessed? The whole charge is, and has been, that we seek\r\nto extend our own institutions into the common territory of the United\r\nStates. Well and wisely has the President of the United States pointed\r\nto that common territory as the joint possession of the country. Jointly\r\nwe held it, jointly we enjoyed it in the earlier period of our country;\r\nbut when, in the progress of years, it became apparent that it could not \r\nlonger be enjoyed in peace, the men of that day took upon themselves, \r\nwisely or unwisely, a power which the Constitution did not confer, and, \r\nby a geographical line, determined to divide the Territories, so that \r\nthe common field, which brothers could not cultivate in peace, should be \r\nheld severally for the benefit of each. Wisely or unwisely, that law \r\nwas denied extension to the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nI was struck, in the course of these debates, to which I have not \r\nbeen in the habit of replying, to hear the Senator from New Hampshire \r\n[Mr. Hale], who so very ardently opposed the extension of that line \r\nto the Pacific Ocean, who held it to be a political stain upon the \r\nhistory of our country, and who would not even allow the southern \r\nboundary of Utah to be the parallel of 36° 30', because of the \r\npolitical implication which was contained in it (the historical \r\ncharacter of the line), plead, as he did a few days ago, for the \r\nconstitutionality and legality and for the sacred character of that \r\nso-called Missouri Compromise.\r\n\r\nI, for one, never believed Congress had the power to pass that law; \r\nyet, as one who was willing to lay down much then, as I am now, to \r\nthe peace, the harmony, and the welfare of our common country, I \r\ndesired to see that line extended to the Pacific Ocean, and that \r\nstrife which now agitates the country never renewed; but with a \r\ndistinct declaration: \"Go ye to the right, and we will go to the \r\nleft; and we go in peace and good-will toward each other.\" Those \r\nwho refused then to allow the extension of that line, those who \r\ndeclared then that it was a violation of principle, and insisted \r\non what they termed non-intervention, must have stood with very \r\npoor grace in the same Chamber when, at a subsequent period, the \r\nSenator from Illinois [Mr. Docoias], bound by his honor on account \r\nof his previous course, moved the repeal of that line to throw open \r\nKansas; they must have stood with very bad grace, in this presence, \r\nto argue that that line was now sacred, and must be kept for ever.\r\n\r\nThe Senator from Illinois stood foremost as one who was willing, at \r\nan early period, to sacrifice his own prejudices and his own interests \r\n(if, in deed, his interests be girt and bounded by the limits of a \r\nState) by proposing to extend that line of pacification to the \r\nPacific Ocean; and, failing in that, then became foremost in the \r\nadvocacy of the doctrine of non-intervention; and upon that, I say, \r\nhe was in honor bound to wipe out that line and throw Kansas open, \r\nlike any other Territory. But, sir, was it then understood by the \r\nSenator from Illinois, or anybody else, that throwing open the \r\nTerritory of Kansas to free emigration was to be the signal for the \r\nmarching of cohorts from one section or another to fight on that \r\nbattle field for mastery? Or, did he not rather think that \r\nemigration was to be allowed to take its course, and soil and \r\nclimate be permitted to decide the great question? We were willing \r\nto abide by it. We were willing to leave natural causes to decide \r\nthe question. Though I differed from the\r\nSenator from New York [Mr. Seward], though I did not believe\r\nthat natural causes, if permitted to flow in their own channel, would\r\nhave produced any other result than the introduction of slave property\r\ninto the Territory of Kansas, I am free to admit that I have not yet\r\nreached the conclusion that that property would have permanently\r\nremained there. That is a question which interest decides. Vermont would\r\nnot keep African slaves, because they were not valuable to her; neither\r\nwill any population, whose density is so great as to trade rapidly on\r\nthe supply of bread, be willing to keep and maintain an improvident\r\npopulation, to feed them in infancy, to care for them in sickness, to\r\nprotect them in age. And thus it will be found in the history of\r\nnations, that, whenever population has reached that density in the\r\ntemperate zones, serfdom, villenage, or slavery, whatever it has been\r\ncalled, has disappeared.\r\n\r\nOurs presents a new problem, one not stated by those who wrote on it in\r\nthe earlier period of our history. It is the problem of a semi-tropical\r\nclimate, the problem of malarial districts, of staple products. This\r\nproduces a result different from that which would be found in the\r\nfarming districts and cooler climates. A race suited to our labor exists\r\nthere. Why should we care whether they go into other Territories or not?\r\nSimply because of the war which is made against our institutions; simply\r\nbecause of the want of security which results from the action of our\r\nopponents in the Northern States. Had you made no political war upon us,\r\nhad you observed the principles of our confederacy as States, that the\r\npeople of each State were to take care of their domestic affairs, or, in\r\nthe language of the Kansas bill, to be left perfectly free to form and\r\nregulate their institutions in their own way, then, I say, within the\r\nlimits of each State the population there would have gone on to attend\r\nto their own affairs, and would have had little regard to whether this\r\nspecies of property, or any other, was held in any other portion of the\r\nUnion. You have made it a political war. We are on the defensive. How\r\nfar are you to push us?\r\n\r\nThe Senator from Alabama [Mr. Clay] has been compelled to notice the\r\nresolutions of his State; nor does that State stand alone. To what issue\r\nare you now pressing us? To the conclusion that, because within the\r\nlimits of a Territory slaves are held as property, a State is to be\r\nexcluded from the Union. I am not in the habit of paying lip-service to\r\nthe Union. The Union is strong enough to confer favors; it is strong\r\nenough to command service. Under these circumstances, the man deserves\r\nbut little credit who sings pæans to its glory. If, through a life, now\r\nnot a short one, a large portion of which has been spent in the public\r\nservice, I have given no better proof of my affection for this Union\r\nthan by declarations, I have lived to little purpose, indeed. I think I\r\nhave given evidence, in every form in which patriotism is ever subjected\r\nto a test, and I trust, whatever evil may be in store for us by those\r\nwho wage war on the Constitution and our rights under it, that I shall\r\nbe able to turn at least to the past and say, \"Up to that period when I\r\nwas declining into the grave, I served a Government I loved, and served\r\nit with my whole heart.\" Nor will I stop to compare services with those\r\ngentlemen who have fair phrases, while they undermine the very\r\nfoundation of the temple our fathers built. If, however, there be those\r\nhere who do really love the Union, and the Constitution, which is the\r\nlife-blood of the Union, the time has come when we should look calmly,\r\nthough steadily, the danger which besets us in the face.\r\n\r\nViolent speeches, denunciatory of people in any particular section of\r\nthe Union, the arraignment of institutions which they inherited and\r\nintend to transmit, as leprous spots on the body-politic, are not the\r\nmeans by which fraternity is to be preserved, or this Union rendered\r\nperpetual. These were not the arguments which our fathers made when,\r\nthrough the struggles of the Revolutionary War, they laid the foundation\r\nof the Union. These are not the principles on which our Constitution, a\r\nbundle of compromises, was made. Then the navigating and the\r\nagricultural States did not war to see which could most injure the\r\nother; but each conceded something from that which it believed to be its\r\nown interest to promote the welfare of the other. Those debates, while\r\nthey brought up all that straggle which belongs to opposite interests\r\nand opposite localities, show none of that bitterness which, so\r\nunfortunately, characterizes every debate in which this body is\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nThe meanest thing--I do not mean otherwise than the smallest\r\nthing--which can arise among us, incidentally, runs into this sectional\r\nagitation, as though it were an epidemic and gave its type to every\r\ndisease. Not even could the committees of this body, when we first\r\nassembled, before any one had the excuse of excitement to plead, be\r\norganized without sectional agitation springing up. Forcibly, I suppose\r\ngravely and sincerely, it was contended here that a great wrong was done\r\nbecause New York, the great commercial State, and the emporium of\r\ncommerce within her limits, was not represented upon the Committee of\r\nCommerce. This will go forth to remote corners, and descend, perhaps, to\r\nafter-times, as an instance in which the Democratic party of the Senate\r\nbehaved with unfairness toward its opponents; for with it will not\r\ndescend the fact that the Democratic party only arranged for itself its\r\nown portion of the committees, taking the control of them, and left\r\nblanks on the committees to be filled by the Opposition; that the\r\nOpposition did fill the blanks; that the Opposition had both the\r\nSenators from New York, but did not choose to put either of them on that\r\ncommittee, though it afterward formed the basis and staple of their\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I concur with my friend from Virginia [Mr. Hunter], and\r\nwhen I rose I did not intend to consume anything like so much time as I\r\nhave occupied. I think there are points, which have been sprung upon the\r\nSenate to-day and heretofore, that require to be answered and to be met.\r\nLike my friend from Virginia, I shall feel that it devolves on me, as a\r\nrepresentative in part of that constituency which is peculiarly\r\nassailed, on another occasion to meet, and, if I am able, to answer, the\r\nallegations and accusations which have been heaped, as well on the\r\nsection in which I live as upon every man who has performed his duty by\r\nextending over them the protection for which our Constitution and\r\nGovernment were formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1858, Mr. Davis being in Portland, Maine, a vast\r\nconcourse of its citizens assembled in front of his hotel to offer him a\r\nwelcome to their city, whereupon he made to them an address, from which\r\nthe following extracts are given:\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens: Accept my sincere thanks for this manifestation of your\r\nkindness. Vanity does not lead me so far to misconceive your purpose as\r\nto appropriate the demonstration to myself; but it is not the less\r\ngratifying to me to be made the medium through which Maine tenders an\r\nexpression of regard to her sister, Mississippi. It is, moreover, with\r\nfeelings of profound gratification that I witness this indication of\r\nthat national sentiment and fraternity which made us, and which alone\r\ncan keep us, one people. At a period but as yesterday, when compared\r\nwith the life of nations, these States were separate, and in some\r\nrespects opposing colonies; their only relation to each other was that\r\nof a common allegiance to the Government of Great Britain. So separate,\r\nindeed almost hostile, was their attitude, that when General Stark, of\r\nBennington memory, was captured by savages on the head-waters of the\r\nKennebec, he was subsequently taken by them to Albany, where they went\r\nto sell furs, and again led away a captive, without interference on the\r\npart of the inhabitants of that neighboring colony to demand or obtain\r\nhis release. United as we now are, were a citizen of the United States,\r\nas an act of hostility to our country, imprisoned or slain in any\r\nquarter of the world, whether on land or sea, the people of each and\r\nevery State of the Union, with one heart and with one voice, would\r\ndemand redress, and woe be to him against whom a brother's blood cried\r\nto as from the ground! Such is the fruit of the wisdom and the justice\r\nwith which our fathers bound contending colonies into confederation, and\r\nblended different habits and rival interests into an harmonious whole,\r\nso that, shoulder to shoulder, they entered on the trial of the\r\nRevolution, and step with step trod its thorny paths until they reached\r\nthe height of national independence, and founded the constitutional\r\nrepresentative liberty which is our birthright....\r\n\r\nBy such men, thus trained and ennobled, our Constitution was framed. It\r\nstands a monument of principle, of forecast, and, above all, of that\r\nliberality which made each willing to sacrifice local interest,\r\nindividual prejudice, or temporary good to the general welfare and the\r\nperpetuity of the republican institutions which they had passed through\r\nfire and blood to secure. The grants were as broad as were necessary for\r\nthe functions of the general agent, and the mutual concessions were\r\ntwice blessed, blessing him who gave and him who received. Whatever was\r\nnecessary for domestic government--requisite in the social organization\r\nof each community--was retained by the States and the people thereof;\r\nand these it was made the duty of all to defend and maintain. Such, in\r\nvery general terms, is the rich political legacy our fathers bequeathed\r\nto us. Shall we preserve and transmit it to posterity? Yes, yes, the\r\nheart responds; and the judgment answers, the task is easily performed.\r\nIt but requires that each should attend to that which most concerns him,\r\nand on which alone he has rightful power to decide and to act; that each\r\nshould adhere to the terms of a written compact, and that all should\r\ncoöperate for that which interest, duty, and honor demand.\r\n\r\nFor the general affairs of our country, both foreign and domestic, we\r\nhave a national Executive and a national Legislature. Representatives\r\nand Senators are chosen by districts and by States, but their acts\r\naffect the whole country, and their obligations are to the whole people.\r\nHe, who, holding either seat, would confine his investigations to the\r\nmere interests of his immediate constituents, would be derelict to his\r\nplain duty; and he who would legislate in hostility to any section would\r\nbe morally unfit for the station, and surely an unsafe depositary, if\r\nnot a treacherous guardian, of the inheritance with which we are\r\nblessed. No one more than myself recognizes the binding force of the\r\nallegiance which the citizen owes to the State of his citizenship, but,\r\nthat State being a party to our compact, a member of the Union, fealty\r\nto the Federal Constitution is not in opposition to, but flows from the\r\nallegiance due to, one of the United States. Washington was not less a\r\nVirginian when he commanded at Boston, nor did Gates or Greene weaken\r\nthe bonds which bound them to their several States by their campaigns in\r\nthe South. In proportion as a citizen loves his own State will he strive\r\nto honor her by preserving her name and her fame, free from the tarnish\r\nof having failed to observe her obligations and to fulfill her duties to\r\nher sister States. Each page of our history is illustrated by the names\r\nand deeds of those who have well understood and discharged the\r\nobligation. Have we so degenerated that we can no longer emulate their\r\nvirtues? Have the purposes for which our Union was formed lost their\r\nvalue? Has patriotism ceased to be a virtue, and is narrow sectionalism\r\nno longer to be counted a crime? Shall the North not rejoice that the\r\nprogress of agriculture in the South has given to her great staple the\r\ncontrolling influence of the commerce of the world, and put\r\nmanufacturing nations under bond to keep the peace with the United\r\nStates?\r\n\r\nShall the South not exult in the fact that the industry and persevering\r\nintelligence of the North have placed her mechanical skill in the front\r\nranks of the civilized world; that our mother-country, whose haughty\r\nminister, some eighty-odd years ago, declared that not a hobnail should\r\nbe made in the colonies which are now the United States, was brought,\r\nsome four years ago, to recognize our preëminence by sending a\r\ncommission to examine our workshops and our machinery, to perfect their\r\nown manufacture of the arms requisite for their defense? Do not our\r\nwhole people, interior and seaboard, North, South, East, and West, alike\r\nfeel proud of the hardihood, the enterprise, the skill, and the courage\r\nof the Yankee sailor, who has borne our flag far as the ocean bears its\r\nfoam, and caused the name and character of the United States to be known\r\nand respected wherever there is wealth enough to woo commerce, and\r\nintelligence to honor merit? So long as we preserve and appreciate the\r\nachievements of Jefferson and Adams, of Franklin and Madison, of\r\nHamilton, of Hancock, and of Rutledge, men who labored for the whole\r\ncountry, and lived for mankind, we can not sink to the petty strife\r\nwhich would sap the foundations and destroy the political fabric our\r\nfathers erected and bequeathed as an inheritance to our posterity for\r\never.\r\n\r\nSince the formation of the Constitution, a vast extension of territory\r\nand the varied relations arising therefrom have presented problems which\r\ncould not have been foreseen. It is just cause for admiration, even\r\nwonder, that the provisions of the fundamental law should have been so\r\nfully adequate to all the wants of a government, new in its\r\norganization, and new in many of the principles on which it was founded.\r\nWhatever fears may have once existed as to the consequences of\r\nterritorial expansion must give way before the evidence which the past\r\naffords. The General Government, strictly confined to its delegated\r\nfunctions, and the State left in the undisturbed exercise of all else,\r\nwe have a theory and practice which fit our Government for immeasurable\r\ndomain, and might, under a millennium of nations, embrace mankind.\r\n\r\nFrom the slope of the Atlantic our population, with ceaseless tide, has\r\npoured into the wide and fertile valley of the Mississippi, with eddying\r\nwhirl has passed to the coast of the Pacific; from the West and the East\r\nthe tides are rushing toward each other, and the mind is carried to the\r\nday when all the cultivable land will be inhabited, and the American\r\npeople will sigh for more wilderness to conquer. But there is here a\r\nphysico-political problem presented for our solution. Were it purely\r\nphysical, your past triumphs would leave but little doubt of your\r\ncapacity to solve it. A community which, when less than twenty thousand,\r\nconceived the grand project of crossing the White Mountains, and\r\nunaided, save by the stimulus which jeers and prophecies of failure\r\ngave, successfully executed the herculean work, might well be impatient\r\nif it were suggested that a physical problem was before us too difficult\r\nfor mastery. The history of man teaches that high mountains and wide\r\ndeserts have resisted the permanent extension of empire, and have formed\r\nthe immutable boundaries of states. From time to time, under some able\r\nleader, have the hordes of the upper plains of Asia swept over the\r\nadjacent country, and rolled their conquering columns over Southern\r\nEurope. Yet, after the lapse of a few generations, the physical law to\r\nwhich I have referred has asserted its supremacy, and the boundaries of\r\nthose states differ little now from those which were obtained three\r\nthousand years ago.\r\n\r\nRome flew her conquering eagles over the then known world, and has now\r\nsubsided into the little territory on which the great city was\r\noriginally built. The Alps and the Pyrenees have been unable to restrain\r\nimperial France; but her expansion was a feverish action, her advance\r\nand her retreat were tracked with blood, and those mountain-ridges are\r\nthe reëstablished limits of her empire. Shall the Rocky Mountains prove\r\na dividing barrier to us? Were ours a central, consolidated Government,\r\ninstead of a Union of sovereign States, our fate might be learned from\r\nthe history of other nations. Thanks to the wisdom and independent\r\nspirit of our forefathers, this is not the case. Each State having sole\r\ncharge of its local interests and domestic affairs, the problem, which\r\nto others has been insoluble, to us is made easy. Rapid, safe, and easy\r\ncommunication between the Atlantic and the Pacific will give\r\ncointelligence, unity of interest, and coöperation among all parts of\r\nour continent-wide republic. The network of railroads which bind the\r\nNorth and the South, the slope of the Atlantic and the valley of the\r\nMississippi, together, testifies that our people have the power to\r\nperform, in that regard, whatever it is their will to achieve.\r\n\r\nWe require a railroad to the States of the Pacific for present uses; the\r\ntime no doubt will come when we shall have need of two or three, it may\r\nbe more. Because of the desert character of the interior country, the\r\nwork will be difficult and expensive. It will require the efforts of a\r\nunited people. The bickerings of little politicians, the jealousies of\r\nsections, must give way to dignity of purpose and zeal for the common\r\ngood. If the object be obstructed by contention and division as to\r\nwhether the route shall be Northern, Southern, or central, the\r\nhandwriting is on the wall, and it requires little skill to see that\r\nfailure is the interpretation of the inscription. You are practical\r\npeople, and may ask, How is that contest to be avoided? By taking the\r\nquestion out of the hands of politicians altogether. Let the Government\r\ngive such aid as it is proper for it to render to the company which\r\nshall propose the most feasible plan; then leave to capitalists, with\r\njudgments sharpened by interest, the selection of the route, and the\r\ndifficulties will diminish, as did those which you overcame when you\r\nconnected your harbor with the Canadian provinces.\r\n\r\nIt would be to trespass on your kindness, and to violate the proprieties\r\nof the occasion, were I to detain the vast concourse which stands before\r\nme, by entering on the discussion of controverted topics, or by further\r\nindulging in the expression of such reflections as circumstances\r\nsuggest. I came to your city in quest of health and repose. From the\r\nmoment I entered it you have showered upon me kindness and hospitality.\r\nThough my experience has taught me to anticipate good rather than evil\r\nfrom my fellow-man, it had not prepared me to expect such unremitting\r\nattentions as have here been bestowed. I have been jocularly asked in\r\nrelation to my coming here, whether I had secured a guarantee for my\r\nsafety, and lo! I have found it. I stand in the midst of thousands of my\r\nfellow-citizens. But, my friends, I came neither distrusting nor\r\napprehensive....\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1858 Mr. Davis visited Boston, and was invited to\r\naddress a public meeting at Faneuil Hall. He was introduced by the Hon.\r\nCaleb Cushing, with whom he had been four years associated in the\r\nCabinet of President Pierce. Mr. Cushing's speech, on account of its\r\ngreat merit, is inserted here, except some complimentary portions of it.\r\n\r\nMr. President--Fellow Citizens: I present myself before you at the\r\ninstance of your chairman, not so much in order to occupy your time with\r\nobservations of my own, as to prepare you for that higher gratification\r\nwhich you are to receive from the remarks of the eminent man here\r\npresent to address you in the course of the evening. I will briefly and\r\nonly suggest to you such reflections as are appropriate to that duty.\r\n\r\nWe are assembled here, my friends, at the call of the Democratic ward\r\nand county committee of Suffolk, for the purpose of ratifying the\r\nnominations made at the late Democratic State Convention--the nomination\r\nof our distinguished and honored fellow-citizen [Hon. Erasmus D. Beach]\r\nwho has already addressed to you the words of wisdom and of patriotism;\r\nas also the nomination of others of our fellow-citizens, whom--if we\r\nmay--we ought, whom the welfare and the honor of our Commonwealth demand\r\nof us, to place in power in the stead of the existing authorities of the\r\nCommonwealth. I would to God it were in our power to say with confidence\r\nthat shall be done! [\"It can be done.\"] We do say that it shall not\r\ndepend upon us that it shall not be done. We do say that in so far as\r\ndepends upon us it shall be done; and whatsoever devoted love of our\r\ncountry and our Commonwealth; whatsoever of our noble and holy\r\nprinciples; whatsoever desire to vindicate our Commonwealth from the\r\nstain that has so long rested upon the name may prompt us to do, that we\r\nwill do, leaving the result to the good providence of God.\r\n\r\nI say we are invited here by the ward and county committee to ratify\r\nthese nominations, and we do ratify them with our whole heart. And we\r\npledge our most earnest efforts at the polls to give success to these\r\nnominations. That call is comprehensive; it is addressed not only to\r\nDemocrats, but to all national men, and so it should be. We know full\r\nwell that there are multitudes of men in this Commonwealth who oppose\r\nthe Democratic party, but who are yet impelled toward us by sympathy for\r\nthe principles we profess, and by the repulsion they have toward the\r\nopinions and purposes of the leaders of the Republican party. They\r\nsympathize with our principles, and we invite them to coöperate with us\r\nin the maintenance of the principles of the Constitution and in the\r\nvindication of the Commonwealth--all national men, whatsoever may have\r\nbeen their past party affinities. But, while we do so, we declare that\r\nit is our belief that the Democratic party is now recognized as that\r\nonly existing national party in the United States--the only\r\nconstitutional party--the only party which by its present principles is\r\ncompetent to govern these United States, whose principles are based upon\r\nthe Constitution--the only party with a platform coextensive with this\r\ngreat Union--this is the great Democratic party. I have heard again and\r\nagain, remonstrances have been addressed to me more than once, because\r\nof the condemnation which Democratic speakers so continually utter about\r\nthe unnationality as well as the unconstitutionality of the Republican\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nLet us reflect a moment; let us recall to mind that the honor of the\r\nexisting organization of this Federal Administration was by the votes of\r\nthe people of these United States sustained when James Buchanan was\r\nnominated for the Presidency, and that he is a worthy representative of\r\nthe Democratic party. Let us reflect also that John C. Fremont was\r\nnominated as the candidate of the Republican party. I pray you,\r\ngentlemen, to reflect upon the different methods by which these\r\nnominations were presented to the people of the United States. On the\r\none hand, there assembled at the Democratic Convention, at Cincinnati,\r\nthe delegates of every one of the States in the Union. That Convention\r\nwas national in its constitution, national in its character, national in\r\nits purpose, and cordially presented to the suffrages of the people of\r\nthe United States a national candidate, a candidate of the whole United\r\nStates; and that candidate was elected not by the votes of one section\r\nof the Union alone, or another section of the Union alone, but by the\r\nconcurrent votes of the South and the North.\r\n\r\nHow was it on the other side? On the other side there assembled a\r\nconvention which, by the very tenor of its call, was confined to sixteen\r\nof the thirty-one States of the Union, which, by the very tenor of its\r\ncall, excluded from its councils fifteen of the thirty-one States of the\r\nUnion, a convention in which appeared the representatives of only\r\nsixteen of the States of the Union--nay, I mistake--as to the remaining\r\nfifteen States of the Union, in their name, pretendedly in their name\r\nand their behalf, there appeared one man--one man only--and he a\r\nself-appointed delegate by pretension from the State of Maryland. That\r\nwas the Convention which presented John C. Fremont to the people of the\r\nUnited States. I say that was a sectional Convention, a sectional\r\nnomination, a sectional party; and no reasoning, no remonstrances, no\r\nprotestations, can discharge the Republican party from the ineffaceable\r\nstigma of that sectional Convention, that sectional nomination, and that\r\nsectional candidate for the suffrages of the United States. That party\r\nitself has placed upon its back that shirt of Nessus which clings to it\r\nand stings it to death. I repeat, then, and I say it in confidence and\r\nvindication, in so far as regards my own belief, I say it in all good\r\nspirit toward multitudes of men in this Commonwealth of the Whig and\r\nAmerican parties in their heretofore organization; I say it to\r\nmultitudes of men who have been betrayed by the passions of the hour\r\ninto joining the sectional combinations of the Republican party; I say\r\nthat in the Democratic party and in that alone is the tower of strength\r\nfor the liberties, the position, and the honor of the United States. But\r\nwhy need I indulge in these reflections in proof of my proposition?\r\nGentlemen, we have here this evening the living proof, the visible,\r\ntangible, audible, incontestable, immortal proof, that the position of\r\nthe Democratic party, in the existing organization of parties, is the\r\nnational, constitutional party of the United States. Gentlemen, I ask\r\nyou to challenge your memories, and look upon the history of the past\r\nfour years of the United States, and can you point me to a Republican\r\nassembly here, in the city of Boston, or anywhere else; can you point me\r\nin the last four years of our history to any occasion on which Faneuil\r\nHall has been crowded to its utmost capability with a Republican\r\nassembly in which appeared any one of those preëminent statesmen of the\r\nSouthern States to honor not merely their States, but these United\r\nStates? When, sir, did that ever happen? When, sir, was that a possible\r\nfact, morally speaking, that any eminent Southern statesman appeared in\r\na Republican assembly in any one of the States of this Union? There\r\nnever was a Republican assembly--an assembly of the Republican party in\r\nfifteen of these States--and I again ask, when, in the remaining sixteen\r\nStates, was there ever convened an assembly of the Republican party\r\nwhich, by reason of bigotry, proscriptive bigotry, of unnational hatred\r\nof the South, and of determined insult of all Southern statesmen, did\r\nnot render it an impossible fact that any Southern statesman should thus\r\nmake his appearance as a member in such Republican Convention? You know\r\nit is so, gentlemen; and yet, have we not a common country? Did those\r\nthirteen colonies which, commencing with that combat at Concord, and\r\nfollowing it with that battle at Bunker's Hill, and pursuing it in every\r\nbattlefield of this continent, did those thirteen colonies form one\r\ncountry or thirteen countries? Nay, did they form two countries, or one\r\ncountry? I would imagine when I listen to a Republican speech here in\r\nthe State of Massachusetts, when I read a Republican address in\r\nMassachusetts, I would imagine fifteen States of this Union--our\r\nfellow-citizens or fellow-sufferers, our fellow-heroes of the\r\nRevolution--I would imagine not that they are our countrymen endeared to\r\nus by ties of consanguinity, but that they are from some foreign\r\ncountry, that they belong to some French or British or Mexican enemies.\r\nThere never was a day in which the forces of war were marshaled against\r\nthe most flagrant abuses toward these United States; there never was a\r\nwar in which these United States have been engaged, never even in the\r\ndeath-struggle of the Revolution, never in our war for maritime\r\nindependence, never in our war with France and Mexico, never was there a\r\ntime when any party in these United States expressed, avowed,\r\nproclaimed, ostentatiously proclaimed more intense hostility to the\r\nBritish, French, Mexican enemy, than I have heard uttered or proclaimed\r\nconcerning our fellow-citizens--brothers in the fifteen States of this\r\nUnion. It is the glory of the Democratic party that we can assume the\r\nburden of our nationality for the Union; that we can make all due\r\nsacrifices in order to show our reprobation of sectionalism, that we of\r\nthe North can sacrifice to the South, from dear attachment to our\r\nfellow-citizens of the South, and they in the South in like manner meet\r\nwith us upon that ground, in order to show their love for the Federal\r\nUnion, and at the risk of encountering local prejudices. In the\r\nDemocratic party alone, as parties are now organized, is this catholic,\r\ngenerous, universal spirit to be found. I say, then, the Democratic\r\nparty has such a character of constitutionality and of nationality.\r\n\r\nAnd now, gentlemen, I have allowed myself unthinkingly to be carried\r\nbeyond my original purpose. I return to it to remind you that here among\r\nus is a citizen of one of the Southern States, eloquent among the most\r\neloquent in debate, wise among the wisest in council, and brave among\r\nthe bravest in the battle-field. A citizen of a Southern State who knows\r\nthat he can associate with you, the representatives of the Democracy and\r\nthe nationality of Massachusetts, that he can associate with you on\r\nequal footing with the fellow-citizens and common members of these\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nMy friends, there are those here present, and in fact there is no one\r\nhere present of whom it can not be said that, in memory and admiration\r\nat least, and if not in the actual fact, yet in proud and bounding\r\nmemory, they have been able to tread the glorious tracks of the\r\nvictorious achievements of Jefferson Davis on the fields of Monterey and\r\nBuena Vista, and all have heard or have read the accents of eloquence\r\naddressed by him to the Senate of the United States; and there is one at\r\nleast who, from his own personal observation, can bear witness to the\r\nfact of the surpassing wisdom of Jefferson Davis in the administration\r\nof the Government of the United States. Such a man, fellow-citizens, you\r\nare this evening to hear, and to hear as a beautiful illustration of the\r\nworking of our republican institutions of these United States; of the\r\nrepublican institutions which in our own country, our own republic, as\r\nin the old republics of Athens and of Rome, exhibit the same\r\ncombinations of the highest military and civic qualities in the same\r\nperson. It must naturally be so, for in a republic every citizen is a\r\nsoldier, and every soldier a citizen. Not in these United States on the\r\noccurrence of foreign war is that spectacle exhibited which we have so\r\nrecently seen in our mother-country, of the administration of the\r\ncountry going abroad begging and stealing soldiers throughout Europe and\r\nAmerica. No! And while I ask you, my friends, to ponder this fact in\r\nrelation to that disastrous struggle of giants which so recently\r\noccurred in our day--the Crimean War--I ask you whether any English\r\ngentleman, any member of the British House of Commons, any member of the\r\nBritish House of Peers, abandoned the ease of home, abandoned his easy\r\nhours at home, and went into the country among his friends, tenants, and\r\nfellow-countrymen, volunteering there to raise troops for the service of\r\nEngland in that hour of her peril; did any such fact occur? No! But here\r\nin these United States we had examples, and illustrious ones, of the\r\nfact that men, eminent in their place in Congress, abandoned their\r\nstations and their honors to go among fellow-citizens of their own\r\nStates, and there raise troops with which to vindicate the honor and the\r\nflag of their country. Of such men was Jefferson Davis.\r\n\r\nThere is now living one military man of prominent distinction in the\r\npublic eye of England and the United States--I mean Sir Colin Campbell,\r\nnow Lord Clyde of Clydesdale. He deserves the distinction he enjoys, for\r\nhe has redeemed the British flag on the ensanguined, burning plains of\r\nIndia. He has restored the glory of the British name in Asia. I honor\r\nhim. Scotland, England, Wales, and Ireland are open, for their counties,\r\nas well as their countries, and their poets, orators, and statesmen, and\r\ntheir generals, belong to our history as well as theirs. I will never\r\ndisavow Henry V on the plains of Agincourt; never Oliver Cromwell on the\r\nfields of Marston Moor and Naseby; never Sarsfield on the banks of the\r\nBoyne. The glories and honors of Sir Colin Campbell are the glories of\r\nthe British race, and the races of Great Britain and Ireland, from whom\r\nwe are descended.\r\n\r\nBut what gained Sir Colin Campbell the opportunity to achieve those\r\nglorious results in India? Remember that, and let us see what it was. On\r\none of those bloody battles fought by the British before the fortress of\r\nSebastopol, in the midst of the perils, the most perilous of all the\r\nbattle-fields England ever encountered in Europe, in one of the bloody\r\ncharges of the Russian cavalry, there was an officer--a man who felt and\r\nwho possessed sufficient confidence in the troops he commanded, and in\r\nthe authority of his own voice and example--received that charge not in\r\nthe ordinary, commonplace, and accustomed manner, by forming his troops\r\ninto a hollow square, and thus arresting the charge, but by forming into\r\ntwo diverging lines, and thus receiving upon the rifles of his\r\nHighlandmen the charge of the Russian cavalry and repelling it. How all\r\nEngland rang with the glory of that achievement! How the general voice\r\nof England placed upon the brows of Sir Colin Campbell the laurels of\r\nthe future mastership of victory for the arms of England! And well they\r\nmight do so. But who originated that movement; who set the example of\r\nthat gallant operation--who but Colonel Jefferson Davis, of the First\r\nMississippi Regiment, on the field of Buena Vista? He was justly\r\nentitled to the applause of the restorer of victory to the arms of the\r\nUnion. Gentlemen, in our country, in this day, such a man, such a master\r\nof the art of war, so daring in the field, such a man may not only\r\naspire to the highest places in the executive government of the Union,\r\nbut such a man may acquire what nowhere else, since the days of Cimon\r\nand Miltiades, of the Cincinnati and the Cornelii of Athens and of Rome,\r\nhas been done by the human race, the combination of eminent powers, of\r\nintellectual cultivation, and of eloquence with the practical, qualities\r\nof a statesman and general.\r\n\r\nBut, gentlemen, I am again betrayed beyond my purpose. Sir [addressing\r\nGeneral Davis], we welcome you to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. You\r\nmay not find here the ardent skies of your own sunny South, but you will\r\nfind as ardent hearts, as warm and generous hands to welcome you to our\r\nCommonwealth. We welcome you to the city of Boston, and you have already\r\nexperienced how open-hearted, how generous, how free from all possible\r\ntaint of sectional thought are the hospitality and cordiality of the\r\ncity of Boston. We welcome you to Faneuil Hall. Many an eloquent voice\r\nhas in all times resounded from the walls of Faneuil Hall. It is said\r\nthat no voice is uttered by man in this air we breathe but enters into\r\nthat air. It continues there immortal as the portion of the universe\r\ninto which it has passed. If it be so, how instinct is Faneuil Hall with\r\nthe voice of the great, good, and glorious of past generations, and of\r\nour own, whose voices have echoed through its walls, whose eloquent\r\nwords have thrilled the hearts of hearers, as if a pointed sword were\r\npassing them through and through. Here Adams aroused his countrymen in\r\nthe War of Independence, and Webster invoked them almost with the dying\r\nbreath of his body--invoked with that voice of majesty and power which\r\nhe alone possessed--invoked them to a union between the North and South.\r\nAy, sir, and who, if he were here present, who from those blest abodes\r\non high from which he looks down upon us would congratulate us for this\r\nscene. First, and above all, because his large heart would have\r\nappreciated the spectacle of a statesman eminent among the most eminent\r\nof the Southern States here addressing an assembly of the people in the\r\ncity of Boston. Because, in the second place, he would have remembered\r\nthat, though divided from you by party relations, in one of the critical\r\nhours of his fame and his honor, your voice was not wanting for his\r\nvindication in the Congress of the United States. Sir, again, I say we\r\nwelcome you to Faneuil Hall.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my fellow-citizens, I will withdraw myself and present to you\r\nthe Hon. Jefferson Davis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress of Jefferson Davis, at Faneuil Hall, Boston, October 12, 1858.\r\n\r\nCountrymen, Brethren, Democrats: Most happy am I to meet you, and to\r\nhave received here renewed assurance--of that which I have so long\r\nbelieved--that the pulsation of the Democratic heart is the same in\r\nevery parallel of latitude, on every meridian of longitude, throughout\r\nthe United States. It required not this to confirm me in a belief I have\r\nso long and so happily enjoyed. Your own great statesman [the Hon. Caleb\r\nCushing], who has introduced me to this assembly, has been too long\r\nassociated with me, too nearly connected, we have labored too many\r\nhours, until one day ran into another, in the cause of our country, for\r\nme to fail to understand that a Massachusetts Democrat has a heart as\r\nwide as the Union, and that its pulsations always beat for the liberty\r\nand happiness of his country. Neither could I be unaware that such was\r\nthe sentiment of the Democracy of New England. For it was my fortune\r\nlately to serve under a President drawn from the neighboring State of\r\nNew Hampshire, and I know that he spoke the language of his heart, for I\r\nlearned it in four years of intimate relations with him, when he said he\r\nknew \"no North, no South, no East, no West, but sacred maintenance of\r\nthe common bond and true devotion to the common brotherhood.\" Never,\r\nsir, in the past history of our country, never, I add, in its future\r\ndestiny, however bright it may be, did or will a man of higher and purer\r\npatriotism, a man more devoted to the common weal of his country, hold\r\nthe helm of our great ship of state, than Franklin Pierce.\r\n\r\nI have heard the resolutions read and approved by this meeting; I have\r\nheard the address of your candidate for Governor; and these, added to\r\nthe address of my old and intimate friend, General Cushing, bear to me\r\nfresh testimony, which I shall be happy to carry away with me, that the\r\nDemocracy, in the language of your own glorious Webster, \"still lives\";\r\nlives, not as his great spirit did, when it hung 'twixt life and death,\r\nlike a star upon the horizon's verge, but lives like the germ that is\r\nshooting upward; like the sapling that is growing to a mighty tree, and\r\nI trust it may redeem Massachusetts to her glorious place in the Union,\r\nwhen she led the van of the defenders of State rights.\r\n\r\nWhen I see Faneuil Hall thus thronged it reminds me of another meeting,\r\nwhen it was found too small to contain the assembly that met here, on\r\nthe call of the people, to know what should be done in relation to the\r\ntea-tax, and when, Faneuil Hall being too small, they went to the old\r\nSouth Church, which still stands a monument of your early day. I hope\r\nthe time will soon come when many Democratic meetings in Boston will be\r\ntoo large for Faneuil Hall. I am welcomed to this hall, so venerable for\r\nall the associations of our early history; to this hall of which you are\r\nso justly proud, and the memories of which are part of the inheritance\r\nof every American citizen; and I felt, as I looked upon it, and\r\nremembered how many voices of patriotic fervor have filled it--how here\r\nthe first movement originated from which the Revolution sprang; how here\r\nbegan the system of town meetings and free discussion--that, though my\r\ntheme was more humble than theirs, as befitted my humbler powers, I had\r\nenough to warn me that I was assuming much to speak in this sacred\r\nchamber. But, when I heard your distinguished orator say that words\r\nuttered here could never die, that they lived and became a part of the\r\ncircumambient air, I feel a hesitation which increases upon me with the\r\nremembrance of his expressions. But, if those voices which breathed the\r\nfirst impulse into the colonies--now the United States--to proclaim\r\nindependence, and to unite for resistance against the power of the\r\nmother-country--if those voices live here still, how must they fare who\r\ncome here to preach treason to the Constitution and to assail the union\r\nof these States? It would seem that their criminal hearts would fear\r\nthat those voices, so long slumbering, would break silence, that those\r\nforms which hang upon these walls behind me might come forth, and that\r\nthe sabers so long sheathed would leap from their scabbards to drive\r\nfrom this sacred temple those who desecrate it as did the money-changers\r\nwho sold doves in the temple of the living God.\r\n\r\nHere you have, to remind you, and to remind all who enter this hall, the\r\nportraits of those men who are dear to every lover of liberty, and part\r\nand parcel of the memory of every American citizen; and highest among\r\nthem all I see you have placed Samuel Adams and John Hancock. You have\r\nplaced them the highest, and properly; for they were two, the only two,\r\nexcepted from the proclamation of mercy, when Governor Gage issued his\r\nanathema against them and against their fellow-patriots. These men, thus\r\nexcepted from the saving grace of the crown, now occupy the highest\r\nplaces in Faneuil Hall, and thus seem to be the highest in the reverence\r\nof the people of Boston. This is one of the instances in which we find\r\ntradition so much more reliable than history; for tradition has borne\r\nthe name of Samuel Adams to the remotest of the colonies, and the new\r\nStates formed out of what was territory of the old colonies; and there\r\nit is a name as sacred among us as it is among you.\r\n\r\nWe all remember how early he saw the necessity of community\r\nindependence. How, through the dim mists of the future, and in advance\r\nof his day, he looked forward to the proclamation of the independence of\r\nMassachusetts; how he steadily strove, through good report and evil\r\nreport, with a great, unwavering heart, whether in the midst of his\r\nfellow-citizens, cheered by their voices, or communing with his own\r\nheart, when driven from his home, his eyes were still fixed upon his\r\nfirst, last hope, the community independence of Massachusetts! Always a\r\ncommanding figure, we see him, at a later period, the leader in the\r\ncorrespondence which waked the feelings of the other colonies to united\r\nfraternal association--the people of Massachusetts with the people of\r\nthe other colonies--there we see his letters acknowledging the receipt\r\nof rice of South Carolina, and the money of New York and\r\nPennsylvania--all these poured in to relieve Boston of the sufferings\r\ninflicted upon her when the port was closed by the despotism of the\r\nBritish crown--we see the beginning of that which insured the\r\ncoöperation of the colonies throughout the desperate struggle of the\r\nRevolution. And we there see that which, if the present generation be\r\ntrue to the memory of their sires, to the memory of the noble men from\r\nwhom they descended, will perpetuate for them that spirit of fraternity\r\nin which the Union began. But it is not here alone, nor in reminiscences\r\nconnected with the objects which present themselves within this hall,\r\nthat the people of Boston have much to excite their patriotism and carry\r\nthem back to the great principles of the Revolutionary struggle. Where\r\nwill you go and not meet some monument to inspire such sentiments? Go to\r\nLexington and Concord, where sixty brave countrymen came with their\r\nfowling-pieces to oppose six hundred veterans--where they forced those\r\nveterans back, pursuing them on the road, fighting from every barn, and\r\nbush, and stock, and stone, till they drove them, retreating, to the\r\nships from which they went forth! And there stand those monuments of\r\nyour early patriotism, Breed's and Bunker's Hills, whose soil drank the\r\nmartyr-blood of men who lived for their country and died for mankind!\r\nCan it be that any of you should tread that soil and forget the great\r\npurposes for which those men died? While, on the other side, rise the\r\nheights of Dorchester, where once stood the encampment of the Virginian,\r\nthe man who came here, and did not ask, Is this a town of Virginia? but,\r\nIs this a town of my brethren? The steady courage and cautious wisdom of\r\nWashington availed to drive the British troops out from the city which\r\nthey had so confidently held. Here, too, you find where once the old\r\nLiberty Tree, connected with so many of your memories, grew. You ask\r\nyour legend, and learn that it was cut down for firewood by British\r\nsoldiers, as some of your meeting-houses were destroyed; they burned the\r\nold tree, and it warmed the soldiers long enough to leave town, and, had\r\nthey burned it a little longer, its light would have shown Washington\r\nand his followers where their enemies were.\r\n\r\nBut they are gone, and never again shall a hostile foot set its imprint\r\nupon your soil. Your harbor is being fortified, to prevent an unexpected\r\nattack on your city by a hostile fleet. But woe to the enemy whose fleet\r\nshall bear him to your shores to set his footprint upon your soil; he\r\ngoes to a prison or to a grave! American fortifications are not built\r\nfrom any fear of invasion, they are intended to guard points where\r\nmarine attacks can be made; and, for the rest, the hearts of Americans\r\nare our ramparts.\r\n\r\nBut, my friends, it is not merely in these associations, so connected\r\nwith the honorable pride of Massachusetts, that one who visits Boston\r\nfinds much for gratification, hope, and instruction. If I were selecting\r\na place where the advocate of strict construction, the extreme expounder\r\nof democratic State-rights doctrine should go for his texts, I would\r\nsend him into the collections of your historical associations. Instead\r\nof going to Boston as a place where only consolidation would be found,\r\nhe would find written, in letters of living light, that sacred creed of\r\nState rights which has been miscalled the ultra opinions of the South;\r\nhe could find among your early records that this Faneuil Hall, the\r\nproperty of the town at the time when Massachusetts was under a colonial\r\ngovernment, administered by a man appointed by the British crown,\r\nguarded by British soldiers, was refused to a British Governor in which\r\nto hold a British festival, because he was going to bring with him the\r\nagents for collecting, and naval officers sent here to enforce, an\r\noppressive tax upon your Commonwealth. Such was the proud spirit of\r\nindependence manifested even in your colonial history. Such is the great\r\nfoundation-stone on which may be erected an eternal monument of State\r\nrights. And so, in an early period of our country, you find\r\nMassachusetts leading the movements, prominent of all the States, in the\r\nassertion of that doctrine which has been recently so much belied.\r\nHaving achieved your independence, having passed through the\r\nConfederation, you assented to the formation of our present\r\nconstitutional Union. You did not surrender your sovereignty. Your\r\nfathers had sacrificed too much to claim, as a reward of their toil,\r\nmerely that they should have a change of masters; and a change of\r\nmasters it would have been had Massachusetts surrendered her State\r\nsovereignty to the central Government, and consented that that central\r\nGovernment should have the power to coerce a State. But, if this power\r\ndoes not exist, if this sovereignty has not been surrendered, then, who\r\ncan deny the words of soberness and truth spoken by your candidate this\r\nevening, when he has pleaded to you the cause of State independence, and\r\nthe right of every community to be judge of its own domestic affairs?\r\nThis is all we have ever asked--we of the South, I mean--for I stand\r\nbefore you as one of those who have always been called the ultra men of\r\nthe South, and I speak, therefore, for that class; and I tell you that\r\nyour candidate for Governor has uttered to-night everything which we\r\nhave claimed as a principle for our protection. And I have found the\r\nsame condition of things in the neighboring State of Maine. I have found\r\nthat the Democrats there asserted the same broad constitutional\r\nprinciple for which we have been contending, by which we are willing to\r\nlive, for which we are willing to die!\r\n\r\nIn this state of the case, my friends, why is the country agitated? The\r\nold controversies have passed away, or they have subsided, and have been\r\ncovered up by one dark pall of somber hue, which increases with every\r\npassing year. Why is it, then, I say, that you are thus agitated in\r\nrelation to the domestic affairs of other communities? Why is it that\r\nthe peace of the country is disturbed in order that one people may judge\r\nof what another people may do? Is there any political power to authorize\r\nsuch interference? If so, where is it? You did not surrender your\r\nsovereignty. You gave to the Federal Government certain functions. It\r\nwas your agent, created for specified purposes. It can do nothing save\r\nthat which you have given it power to perform. Where is the grant? Has\r\nit a right to determine what shall be property? Surely not; that belongs\r\nto every community to decide for itself; you judge in your case--every\r\nother State must judge in its case. The Federal Government has no power\r\nto destroy property. Do you pay taxes, then, to an agent, that he may\r\ndestroy your property? Do you support him for that purpose? It is an\r\nabsurdity on the face of it. To ask the question is to answer it. The\r\nGovernment is instituted to protect, not to destroy, property. And, in\r\nabundance of caution, your fathers provided that the Federal Government\r\nshould not take private property for its own use unless by making due\r\ncompensation therefor. It is prohibited from attempting to destroy\r\nproperty. One of its great purposes was protection to the States.\r\nWhenever that power is made a source of danger, we destroy the purpose\r\nfor which the Government was formed.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, have you agitators? With Pharisaical pretension it is\r\nsometimes said it is a moral obligation to agitate, and I suppose they\r\nare going through a sort of vicarious repentance for other men's sins.\r\nWith all due allowance for their zeal, we ask, how do they decide that\r\nit is a sin? By what standard do they measure it? Not the Constitution;\r\nthe Constitution recognizes the property in slaves in many forms, and\r\nimposes obligations in connection with that recognition. Not the Bible;\r\nthat justifies it. Not the good of society; for, if they go where it\r\nexists, they find that society recognizes it as good. What, then, is\r\ntheir standard? The good of mankind? Is that seen in the diminished\r\nresources of the country? Is that seen in the diminished comfort of the\r\nworld? Or is not the reverse exhibited? Is there, in the cause of\r\nChristianity, a motive for the prohibition of the system which is the\r\nonly agency through which Christianity has reached that inferior race,\r\nthe only means by which they have been civilized and elevated? Or is\r\ntheir piety manifested in denunciation of their brethren, who are\r\ndeterred from answering their denunciation only by the contempt which\r\nthey feel for a mere brawler, who intends to end his brawling only in\r\nempty words?\r\n\r\nWhat, my friends, must be the consequences? Good or evil? They have been\r\nevil, and evil they must be only to the end. Not one particle of good\r\nhas been done to any man, of any color, by this agitation. It has been\r\ninsidiously working the purpose of sedition, for the destruction of that\r\nUnion on which our hopes of future greatness depend.\r\n\r\nOn the one side, then, you see agitation tending slowly and steadily to\r\nthat separation of States, which, if you have any hope connected with\r\nthe liberty of mankind; if you have any national pride connected with\r\nmaking your country the greatest on the face of the earth; if you have\r\nany sacred regard for the obligations which the deeds and the blood of\r\nyour fathers entailed upon you, that hope should prompt you to reject\r\nanything that would tend to destroy the result of that experiment which\r\nthey left it to you to conclude and perpetuate. On the other hand, if\r\neach community, in accordance with the principles of our Government,\r\nshould regard its domestic interests as a part of the common whole, and\r\nstruggle for the benefit of all, this would steadily lead us to\r\nfraternity, to unity, to coöperation, to the increase of our happiness\r\nand the extension of the benefits of our useful example over mankind.\r\nThe flag of the Union, whose stars have already more than doubled their\r\noriginal number, with its ample folds may wave, the recognized flag of\r\nevery State or the recognized protector of every State upon the\r\nContinent of America.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the view which I have presented of the early idea of\r\ncommunity independence, I will add the very striking fact that one of\r\nthe colonies, about the time they had resolved to unite for the purpose\r\nof achieving their independence, addressed the Colonial Congress to know\r\nin what condition it would be in the interval between its separation\r\nfrom the Government of Great Britain and the establishment of a\r\ngovernment on this continent. The answer of the Colonial Congress was\r\nexactly what might have been expected--exactly what State-rights\r\nDemocracy would answer to-day to such an inquiry--that they \"had nothing\r\nto do with it.\" If such sentiment had continued, if it had governed in\r\nevery State, if representatives had been chosen upon it, then your halls\r\nof Federal legislation would not have been disturbed about the question\r\nof the domestic institutions of the different States. The peace of the\r\ncountry would not be hazarded by the arraignment of the family relations\r\nof people over whom the Government has no control. If in harmony working\r\ntogether, with co-intelligence for the conservation of the interests of\r\nthe country--if protection to the States and the other great ends for\r\nwhich the Government was established, had been the aim and united effort\r\nof all--what effects would not have been produced? As our Government\r\nincreases in expansion it would increase in its beneficent effect upon\r\nthe people; we should, as we grow in power and prosperity, also grow in\r\nfraternity, and it would be no longer a wonder to see a man coming from\r\na Southern State to address a Democratic audience in Boston.\r\n\r\nBut I have referred to the fact that Massachusetts stood preëminently\r\nforward among those who asserted community independence: and this\r\nreminds me of another incident. President Washington visited Boston when\r\nJohn Hancock was Governor, and Hancock refused to call upon the\r\nPresident, because he contended that any man who came within the limits\r\nof Massachusetts must yield rank and precedence to the Governor of the\r\nState. He eventually only surrendered the point on account of his\r\npersonal regard and respect for the character of George Washington. I\r\nhonor him for this, and value it as one of the early testimonies in\r\nfavor of State rights. I wish all our Governors had the same regard for\r\nthe dignity of the State as had the great and glorious John Hancock.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning the founders of this Government were true democratic\r\nState-rights men. Democracy was State rights, and State rights was\r\ndemocracy, and it is so to-day. Your resolutions breathe it. The\r\nDeclaration of Independence embodied the sentiments which had lived in\r\nthe hearts of the country for many years before its formal assertion.\r\nOur fathers asserted the great principle--the right of the people to\r\nchoose their own government--and that government rested upon the consent\r\nof the governed. In every form of expression it uttered the same idea,\r\ncommunity independence and the dependence of the Union upon the\r\ncommunities of which it consisted. It was an American declaration of the\r\nunalienable right of man; it was a general truth, and I wish it were\r\naccepted by all men. But I have said that this State sovereignty--this\r\ncommunity independence--has never been surrendered, and that there is no\r\npower in the Federal Government to coerce a State. Will any one ask me,\r\nthen, how a State is to be held to the fulfillment of its obligations?\r\nMy answer is, by its honor. The obligation is the more sacred to observe\r\nevery feature of the compact, because there is no power to enforce it.\r\nThe great error of the Confederation was, that it attempted to act upon\r\nthe States. It was found impracticable, and our present form of\r\ngovernment was adopted, which acts upon individuals, and is not designed\r\nto act upon States. The question of State coercion was raised in the\r\nConvention which framed the Constitution, and, after discussion, the\r\nproposition to give power to the General Government to enforce against\r\nany State obedience to the laws was rejected. It is upon the ground that\r\na State can not be coerced that observance of the compact is a sacred\r\nobligation. It was upon this principle that our fathers depended for the\r\nperpetuity of a fraternal Union, and for the security of the rights that\r\nthe Constitution was designed to preserve. The fugitive slave compact in\r\nthe Constitution of the United States implied that the States should\r\nfulfill it voluntarily. They expected the States to legislate so as to\r\nsecure the rendition of fugitives; and in 1778 it was a matter of\r\ncomplaint that the Spanish colony of Florida did not restore fugitive\r\nnegroes from the United States who escaped into that colony, and a\r\ncommittee, composed of Hamilton, of New York, Sedgwick, of\r\nMassachusetts, and Mason, of Virginia, reported resolutions in the\r\nCongress, instructing the Secretary of Foreign Affairs to address the\r\n_chargé d'affaires_ at Madrid to apply to his Majesty of Spain to issue\r\norders to his governor to compel them to secure the rendition of\r\nfugitive negroes. This was the sentiment of the committee, and they\r\nadded, also, that the States would return any slaves from Florida who\r\nmight escape into their limits.\r\n\r\nWhen the constitutional obligation was imposed, who could have doubted\r\nthat every State, faithful to its obligations, would comply with the\r\nrequirements of the Constitution, and waive all questions as to whether\r\nthe institution should or should not exist in another community over\r\nwhich they had no control? Congress was at last forced to legislate on\r\nthe subject, and they have continued, up to a recent period, to\r\nlegislate, and this has been one of the causes by which you have been\r\ndisturbed. You have been called upon to make war against a law which\r\nneed never to have been enacted, if each State had done the duty which\r\nshe was called upon by the Constitution to perform.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, this presents one phase of agitation--negro agitation: there\r\nis another and graver question, it is in relation to the prohibition by\r\nCongress of the introduction of slave property into the Territories.\r\nWhat power does Congress possess in this connection? Has it the right to\r\nsay what shall be property anywhere? If it has, from what clause of the\r\nConstitution does it derive that power? Have other States the power to\r\nprescribe the condition upon which a citizen of another State shall\r\nenter upon and enjoy territory--common property of all? Clearly not.\r\nShall the inhabitants who first go into the Territory deprive any\r\ncitizen of the United States of those rights which belong to him as an\r\nequal owner of the soil? Certainly not. Sovereign jurisdiction can only\r\npass to these inhabitants when the States, the owners of that Territory\r\nshall recognize their right to become an equal member of the Union.\r\nUntil then, the Constitution and the laws of the Union must be the rule\r\ngoverning within the limits of a Territory.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution recognizes all property, and gives equal privileges to\r\nevery citizen of the States; and it would be a violation of its\r\nfundamental principles to attempt any discrimination.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing of truth or justice with which to sustain this\r\nagitation, or ground for it, unless it be that it is a very good bridge\r\nover which to pass into office; a little stock of trade in politics\r\nbuilt up to aid men who are missionaries staying at home; reformers of\r\nthings which they do not go to learn; preachers without a congregation;\r\noverseers without laborers and without wages; war-horses who snuff the\r\nbattle afar off and cry: \"Aha! aha! I am afar off.\"\r\n\r\nThus it is that the peace of the Union is disturbed; thus it is that\r\nbrother is arrayed against brother; thus it is that the people come to\r\nconsider not how they can promote each other's interests, but how they\r\nmay successfully war upon them. And among the things most odious to my\r\nmind is to find a man who enters upon a public office, under the\r\nsanction of the Constitution, and taking an oath to support the\r\nConstitution--the compact between the States binding each for the common\r\ndefense and general welfare of the other--and retaining to himself a\r\nmental reservation that he will war upon the institutions and the\r\nproperty of any of the States of the Union. It is a crime too low to\r\ncharacterize as it deserves before this assembly. It is one which would\r\ndisgrace a gentleman--one which a man with self-respect would never\r\ncommit. To swear that he will support the Constitution, to take an\r\noffice which belongs in many of its relations to all the States, and to\r\nuse it as a means of injuring a portion of the States of whom he is thus\r\nan agent, is treason to everything that is honorable in man. It is the\r\nbase and cowardly attack of him who gains the confidence of another in\r\norder that he may wound him. But I have often heard it argued, and I\r\nhave seen it published: I have seen a petition that was circulated for\r\nsigners, announcing that there was an incompatibility between the\r\ndifferent sections of the Union; that it had been tried long enough, and\r\nthat they must get rid of those sections in which the curse of slavery\r\nexisted. Ah! those sages, so much wiser than our fathers, have found out\r\nthat there is incompatibility in that which existed when the Union was\r\nformed. They have found an incompatibility inconsistent with union, in\r\nthat which existed when South Carolina sent her rice to Boston, and\r\nMaryland and Pennsylvania and New York brought in their funds for her\r\nrelief. The fact is that, from that day to this, the difference between\r\nthe people of the colonies has been steadily diminishing, and the\r\npossible advantages of union in no small degree augmented. The variety\r\nof product of soil and of climate has been multiplied, both by the\r\nexpansion of our country and by the introduction of new tropical\r\nproducts not cultivated at that time; so that every motive to union\r\nwhich your fathers had, in a diversity which should give prosperity to\r\nthe country, exists in a higher degree to-day than when this Union was\r\nformed, and this diversity is fundamental to the prosperity of the\r\npeople of the several sections of the country.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, to-day, in sentiment and interest, less than on the day\r\nwhen the Declaration of Independence was made. Diversity there\r\nis--diversity of character--but it is not of that extreme kind which\r\nproves incompatibility; for your Massachusetts man, when he comes into\r\nMississippi, adopts our opinions and our institutions, and frequently\r\nbecomes the most extreme man among us. As our country has extended, as\r\nnew products have been introduced into it, this Union and the free trade\r\nthat belongs to it have been of increasing value. And I say, moreover,\r\nthat it is not an unfortunate circumstance that this diversity of\r\npursuit and character still remains. Originally it sprang in no small\r\ndegree from natural causes. Massachusetts became a manufacturing and\r\ncommercial State because of her fine harbors--because of her\r\nwater-power, making its last leap into the sea, so that the ship of\r\ncommerce brought the staple to the manufacturing power. This made you a\r\ncommercial and a manufacturing people. In the Southern States great\r\nplains interpose between the last leaps of the streams and the sea.\r\nThose plains were cultivated in staple crops, and the sea brought their\r\nproducts to your streams to be manufactured. This was the first\r\nbeginning of the differences.\r\n\r\nThen your longer and more severe winters, your soil not so favorable for\r\nagriculture, in a degree kept you a manufacturing and a commercial\r\npeople. Even after the cause had passed away--after railroads had been\r\nbuilt--after the steam-engine had become a motive power for a large part\r\nof manufacturing machinery, the natural causes from which your people\r\nobtained a manufacturing ascendancy and ours became chiefly\r\nagriculturists continued to act in a considerable measure to preserve\r\nthat relation. Your interest is to remain a manufacturing, and ours to\r\nremain an agricultural people. Your prosperity, then, is to receive our\r\nstaple and to manufacture it, and ours to sell it to you and buy the\r\nmanufactured goods. This is an interweaving of interests which makes us\r\nall the richer and happier.\r\n\r\nBut this accursed agitation, this intermeddling with the affairs of\r\nother people, is that alone which will promote a desire in the mind of\r\nany one to separate these great and glorious States. The seeds of\r\ndissension may be sown by invidious reflections. Men may be goaded by\r\nthe constant attempts to infringe upon rights and to disturb\r\ntranquillity, and in the resentment which follows it is not possible to\r\ntell how far the wave may rush. I therefore plead to you now to arrest a\r\nfanaticism which has been evil in the beginning and must be evil in the\r\nend. You may not have the numerical power requisite; and those at a\r\ndistance may not understand how many of you there are desirous to put a\r\nstop to the course of this agitation. For me, I have learned since I\r\nhave been in New England the vast mass of true State-rights Democrats to\r\nbe found within its limits--though not represented in the halls of\r\nCongress. And if it comes to the worst--if, availing themselves of a\r\nmajority in the two Houses of Congress, they should attempt to trample\r\nupon the Constitution; if they should attempt to violate the rights of\r\nthe States; if they should attempt to infringe upon our equality in the\r\nUnion--I believe that even in Massachusetts, though it has not had a\r\nrepresentative in Congress for many a day, the State-rights Democracy,\r\nin whose breasts beats the spirit of the Revolution, can and will whip\r\nthe black Republicans. I trust we shall never be thus purified, as it\r\nwere, by fire; but that the peaceful, progressive revolution of the\r\nballot-box will answer all the glorious purposes of the Constitution and\r\nthe Union. And I marked that the distinguished orator and statesman who\r\npreceded me, in addressing you, used the words \"national\" and\r\n\"constitutional\" in such relation to each other as to show that in his\r\nmind the one was a synonym of the other. I say so: we became national by\r\nthe Constitution, the bond for uniting the States, and national and\r\nconstitutional are convertible terms.\r\n\r\nYour candidate for the high office of Governor--whom I have been once or\r\ntwice on the point of calling Governor, and whom I hope I may be able\r\nsoon to call so--in his remarks to you has presented the same idea in\r\nanother form. And well may Massachusetts orators, without even\r\nperceiving what they are saying, utter sentiments which lie at the\r\nfoundation of your colonial as well as your subsequent political\r\nhistory, which existed in Massachusetts before the Revolution, and have\r\nexisted ever since, whenever the true spirit which comes down from the\r\nRevolutionary sires has swelled and found utterance within her limits.\r\n\r\nIt has been not only, my friends, in this increasing and mutual\r\ndependence of interest that we have found new ties to you. Those bonds\r\nare both material and mental. Every improvement or invention, every\r\nconstruction of a railroad, has formed a new reason for our being one.\r\nEvery new achievement, whether it has been in arts or science, in war or\r\nin manufactures, has constituted for us a new bond and a new sentiment\r\nholding us together.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, I would ask, do we see these lengthened shadows which follow\r\nin the course of our political history? Is it because our sun is\r\ndeclining to the horizon? Are they the shadows of evening, or are they,\r\nas I hopefully believe, but the mists which are exhaled by the sun as it\r\nrises, but which are to be dispersed by its meridian glory? Are they but\r\nthe little evanishing clouds that flit between the people and the great\r\nobjects for which the Constitution was established? I hopefully look\r\ntoward the reaction which will establish the fact that our sun is still\r\nin the ascendant--that that cloud which has so long covered our\r\npolitical horizon is to be dispersed--that we are not again to be\r\ndivided on parallels of latitude and about the domestic institutions of\r\nStates--a sectional attack on the prosperity and tranquillity of a\r\nnation--but only by differences in opinion upon measures of expediency,\r\nupon questions of relative interest, by discussions as to the powers of\r\nthe States and the rights of the States, and the powers of the Federal\r\nGovernment--such discussion as is commemorated in this picture of your\r\nown great and glorious Webster, when he specially addressed our best,\r\nmost tried, and greatest man, the pure and incorruptible Calhoun,\r\nrepresented as intently listening to catch the accents of eloquence that\r\nfell from his lips. Those giants strove each for his conviction, not\r\nagainst a section--not against each other; they stood to each other in\r\nthe relation of personal affection and esteem, and never did I see Mr.\r\nWebster so agitated, never did I hear his voice falter, as when he\r\ndelivered the eulogy on John C. Calhoun.\r\n\r\nBut allusion was made to my own connection with your great and favorite\r\ndeparted statesman. Of that I will only say, on this occasion, that very\r\nearly in my Congressional life Mr. Webster was arraigned for an offense\r\nwhich affected him most deeply. He was no accountant, and all knew that.\r\nHe was arraigned on a pecuniary charge--the misapplication of what is\r\nknown as the secret-service fund--and I was one of the committee that\r\nhad to investigate the charge. I endeavored to do justice. I endeavored\r\nto examine the evidence with a view to ascertain the truth. It is true I\r\nremembered that he was an eminent American statesman. It is true that as\r\nan American I hoped he would come out without a stain upon his garments.\r\nBut I entered upon the investigation to find the truth and to do\r\njustice. The result was, he was acquitted of every charge that was made\r\nagainst him, and it was equally my pride and my pleasure to vindicate\r\nhim in every form which lay within my power. No one that knew Daniel\r\nWebster could have believed that he would ever ask whether a charge was\r\nmade against a Massachusetts man or a Mississippian. No! It belonged to\r\na lower, to a later, and I trust a shorter-lived race of statesmen, who\r\nmeasure all facts by considerations of latitude and longitude.\r\n\r\nI honor that sentiment which makes us oftentimes too confident, and to\r\ndespise too much the danger of that agitation which disturbs the peace\r\nof the country. I respect that feeling which regards the Union as too\r\nstrong to be broken. But, at the same time, in sober judgment, it will\r\nnot do to treat too lightly the danger which has existed and still\r\nexists. I have heard our Constitution and Union compared to the granite\r\nshores which face the sea, and, dashing back the foam of the waves,\r\nstand unmoved by their fury. Now I accept the simile: and I have stood\r\nupon the shore, and I have seen the waves of the sea dash upon the\r\ngranite of your own shores which frowns over the ocean, have seen the\r\nspray thrown back from the cliffs. But, when the tide had ebbed, I saw\r\nthat the rock was seamed and worn; and, when the tide was low, the\r\npieces that had been riven from the granite rock were lying at its base.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the waves of sectional agitation are dashing themselves against\r\nthe granite patriotism of the land. But even that must show the seams\r\nand scars of the conflict. Sectional hostility will follow. The danger\r\nlies at your door, and it is time to arrest it. Too long have we allowed\r\nthis influence to progress. It is time that men should go back to the\r\nfirst foundation of our institutions. They should drink the waters of\r\nthe fountain at the source of our colonial and early history.\r\n\r\nYou, men of Boston, go to the street where the massacre occurred in\r\n1770. There you should learn how your fathers strove for community\r\nrights. And near the same spot you should learn how proudly the\r\ndelegation of democracy came to demand the removal of the troops from\r\nBoston, and how the venerable Samuel Adams stood asserting the rights of\r\ndemocracy, dauntless as Hampden, clear and eloquent as Sidney; and how\r\nthey drove out the myrmidons who had trampled on the rights of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAll over our country, these monuments, instructive to the present\r\ngeneration, of what our fathers did, are to be found. In the library of\r\nyour association for the collection of your early history, I found a\r\nletter descriptive of the reading of the church service to his army by\r\nGeneral Washington, during one of those winters when the army was\r\nill-clad and without shoes, when he built a little log-cabin for a\r\nmeeting-house, and there, reading the service to them his sight failed\r\nhim, he put on his glasses and, with emotion which manifested the\r\nreality of his feelings, said, \"I have grown gray in serving my country,\r\nand now I am growing blind.\"\r\n\r\nBy the aid of your records you may call before you the day when the\r\ndelegation of the army of the democracy of Boston demanded compliance\r\nwith its requirements for the removal of the troops. A painfully\r\nthrilling case will be found in the heroic conduct of your fathers'\r\nfriends, the patriots in Charleston, South Carolina. The prisoners were\r\nput upon the hulks, where the small-pox existed, and where they were\r\nbrought on shore to stay the progress of the infection, and were\r\noffered, if they would enlist in his Majesty's service, release from all\r\ntheir sufferings, present and prospective; while, if they would not, the\r\nrations would be taken from their families, and they would be sent back\r\nto the hulks and again exposed to the infection. Emaciated as they were,\r\nwith the prospect of being returned to confinement, and their families\r\nturned out into the streets, the spirit of independence, the devotion to\r\nliberty, was so supreme in their breasts, that they gave one loud huzza\r\nfor General Washington, and went to meet death in their loathsome\r\nprison. From these glorious recollections, from the emotions which they\r\ncreate, when the sacrifices of those who gave you the heritage of\r\nliberty are read in your early history, the eye is directed to our\r\npresent condition. Mark the prosperity, the growth, the honorable career\r\nof your country under the voluntary union of independent States. I do\r\nnot envy the heart of that American whose pulse does not beat quicker,\r\nand who does not feel within him a high exultation and pride, in the\r\npast glory and future prospects of his country. With these prospects are\r\nassociated--if we are only wise, true, and faithful, if we shun\r\nsectional dissension--all that man can conceive of the progression of\r\nthe American people. And the only danger which threatens those high\r\nprospects is that miserable spirit which, disregarding the obligations\r\nof honor, makes war upon the Constitution; which induces men to assume\r\npowers they do not possess, trampling as well upon the great principles\r\nwhich lie at the foundation of the Declaration of Independence, and the\r\nConstitution of the Union, as upon the honorable obligations which were\r\nfixed upon them by their fathers. They with internecine strife would\r\nsacrifice themselves and their brethren to a spirit which is a disgrace\r\nto our common country. With these views, it will not be surprising, to\r\nthose who most differ from me, that I feel an ardent desire for the\r\nsuccess of this State-rights Democracy; that, convinced as I am of the\r\nill consequences of the described heresies unless they be corrected; of\r\nthe evils upon which they would precipitate the country unless they are\r\nrestrained--I say, none need be surprised if, prompted by such\r\naspirations, and impressed by such forebodings as now open themselves\r\nbefore me, I have spoken freely, yielding to motives I would suppress\r\nand can not avoid. I have often, elsewhere than in the State of which I\r\nam a citizen, spoken in favor of that party which alone is national, in\r\nwhich alone lies the hope of preserving the Constitution and the\r\nperpetuation of the Government and of the blessings which it was\r\nordained and established to secure.\r\n\r\nMy friends, my brethren, my countrymen, I thank you for the patient\r\nattention you have given me. It is the first time it has ever befallen\r\nme to address an audience here. It will probably be the last. Residing\r\nin a remote section of the country, with private as well as public\r\nduties to occupy the whole of my time, it would only be for a very\r\nhurried visit, or under some such necessity for a restoration to health\r\nas brought me here this season, that I could ever expect to remain long\r\namong you, or in any other portion of the Union than the State of which\r\nI am a citizen.\r\n\r\nI have staid long enough to feel that generous hospitality which evinces\r\nitself to-night, which has evinced itself in Boston since I have been\r\nhere, and showed itself in every town and village of New England where I\r\nhave gone. I have staid here, too, long enough to learn that, though not\r\nrepresented in Congress, there is a large mass of as true Democrats as\r\nare to be found in any portion of the Union within the limits of New\r\nEngland. Their purposes, their construction of the Constitution, their\r\nhopes for the future, their respect for the past, is the same as that\r\nwhich exists among my beloved brethren in Mississippi....\r\n\r\nIn the hour of apprehension I shall turn back to my observations here,\r\nin this consecrated hall, where men so early devoted themselves to\r\nliberty and community independence; and I shall endeavor to impress upon\r\nothers, who know you only as you are represented in the two Houses of\r\nCongress, how true and how many are the hearts that beat for\r\nconstitutional liberty, and faithfully respect every clause and\r\nguarantee which the Constitution contains for any and every portion of\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX F.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeech of Mr. Davis, of Mississippi, in the Senate of the United States,\r\non the resolutions offered by him relative to the relations of the\r\nStates, the Federal Government, and the Territories, May 7, 1860.\r\n\r\nMr. President: Among the many blessings for which we are indebted to our\r\nancestry is that of transmitting to us a written Constitution; a fixed\r\nstandard to which, in the progress of events, every case may be\r\nreferred, and by which it may be measured. But for this, the wise men\r\nwho formed our Government dared not have hoped for its perpetuity; for\r\nthey saw, floating down the tide of time, wreck after wreck, marking the\r\nshort life of every republic which had preceded them. With this,\r\nhowever, to check, to restrain, and to direct their posterity, they\r\nmight reasonably hope the Government they founded should last for ever;\r\nthat it should secure the great purposes for which it was ordained and\r\nestablished; that it would be the shield of their posterity equally in\r\nevery part of the country, and equally in all time to come. It was this\r\nwhich mainly distinguished the formation of our Government from those\r\nconfederacies or republics which had preceded it; and this is the best\r\nfoundation for our hope to-day. The resolutions which have been read,\r\nand which I had the honor to present to the Senate, are little more than\r\nthe announcement of what I hold to be the clearly-expressed declarations\r\nof the Constitution itself. To that fixed standard it is sought, at this\r\ntime, when we are drifting far from the initial point, and when clouds\r\nand darkness hover over us, to bring back the Government, and to test\r\nour condition to-day by the rules which our fathers laid down for us in\r\nthe beginning.\r\n\r\nThe differences which exist between different portions of the country,\r\nthe rivalries and the jealousies of to-day, though differing in degree,\r\nare exactly of the nature of those which preceded the formation of the\r\nConstitution. Our fathers were aware of the different interests of the\r\nnavigating and planting States, as they were then regarded. They sought\r\nto compose those difficulties, and, by compensating advantages given by\r\none to the other, to form a Government equal and just in its operation,\r\nand which, like the gentle showers of heaven, should fall twice blessed,\r\nblessing him that gives and him that receives. This beneficial action\r\nand reaction between the different interests of the country constituted\r\nthe bond of union and the motive of its formation. They constitute it\r\nto-day, if we are sufficiently wise to appreciate our interests, and\r\nsufficiently faithful to observe our trust. Indeed, with the extension\r\nof territory, with the multiplication of interests, with the varieties,\r\nincreasing from time to time, of the products of this great country, the\r\nbonds which bind the Union together should have increased. Rationally\r\nconsidered, they have increased, because the free trade which was\r\nestablished in the beginning has now become more valuable to the people\r\nof the United States than their trade with all the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to argue questions of natural rights and inherent\r\npowers. I plant my reliance upon the Constitution; that Constitution\r\nwhich you have all sworn to support; that Constitution which you have\r\nsolemnly pledged yourself to maintain while you hold the seat you now\r\noccupy in the Senate; to which you are bound in its spirit and in its\r\nletter, not grudgingly, but willingly, to render your obedience and\r\nsupport as long as you hold office under the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nWhen the tempter entered the garden of Eden and induced our common\r\nmother to offend against the law which God had given to her through\r\nAdam, he was the first teacher of that \"higher law\" which sets the will\r\nof the individual above the solemn rule which he is bound, as a part of\r\nevery community, to observe. From the effect of the introduction of that\r\nhigher law in the garden of Eden, and the fall consequent upon it, came\r\nsin into the world; and from sin came death and banishment and\r\nsubjugation, as the punishment of sin; the loss of life, unfettered\r\nliberty, and perfect happiness followed from that first great law which\r\nwas given by God to fallen man.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, shall we talk about natural rights? Who is to define them?\r\nWhere is the judge who is to sit over the court to try natural rights?\r\nWhat is the era at which you will fix the date by which you will\r\ndetermine the breadth, the length, and the depth of those called the\r\nrights of nature? Shall it be after the fall, when the earth was covered\r\nwith thorns, and man had to earn his bread in the sweat of his brow? Or\r\nshall it be when there was equality between the sexes, when he lived in\r\nthe garden, when all his wants were supplied, and when thorns and\r\nthistles were unknown on the face of the earth? Shall it be then? Shall\r\nit be after the flood, when, for the first sin committed after the\r\nwaters retired from the face of the earth, the doom of slavery was fixed\r\nupon the mongrel descendants of Ham? If after the flood, and after that\r\ndecree, how idle is all this prating about natural rights as standing\r\nabove the obligations of civil government! The Constitution is the law\r\nsupreme to every American. It is the plighted faith of our fathers; it\r\nis the hope of our posterity. I say, then, I come not to argue questions\r\noutside of or above the Constitution, but to plead the cause of right,\r\nof law and order, under the Constitution and to plead it to those who\r\nhave sworn to abide by that obligation.\r\n\r\nOne of the fruitful sources, as I hold it, of the errors which prevail\r\nin our country, is the theory that this is a Government of one people;\r\nthat the Government of the United States was formed by a mass. The\r\nGovernment of the United States is a compact between the sovereign\r\nmembers who formed it; and, if there be one feature common to all the\r\ncolonies planted upon the shores of America, it is desire for community\r\nindependence. It was for this the Puritan, the Huguenot, the Catholic,\r\nthe Quaker, the Protestant, left the land of their nativity, and, guided\r\nby the shadows thrown by the fires of European persecution, they sought\r\nand found the American refuge of civil and religious freedom. While they\r\nexisted as separate and distinct colonies they were not forbearing\r\ntoward each other. They oppressed opposite religions. They did not come\r\nhere with the enlarged idea of no established religion. The Puritans\r\ndrove out the Quakers; the Church-of-England men drove out the\r\nCatholics. Persecution reigned through the colonies, except, perhaps,\r\nthat of the Catholic colony of Maryland; but the rule was--persecution.\r\nTherefore, I say the common idea, and the only common idea, was\r\ncommunity independence--the right of each independent people to do as\r\nthey pleased in their domestic affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Independence was made by the colonies, each for\r\nitself. The recognition of their independence was not for the colonies\r\nunited, but for each of the colonies which had maintained its\r\nindependence; and so, when the Constitution was formed, the delegates\r\nwere not elected by the people _en masse_, but they came from each one\r\nof the States; and when the Constitution was formed it was referred, not\r\nto the people _en masse_, but to the States severally, and severally by\r\nthem ratified and approved. But, if there be anything which enforces\r\nthis idea more than another, it is the unequal dates at which it\r\nreceived this approval. From first to last, nearly two years and a half\r\nelapsed; and the Government went into operation something like a year--I\r\nbelieve more than a year--before the last ratification was made. Is it\r\nthen contended that, by this ratification and adoption of the\r\nConstitution, the States surrendered that sovereignty which they had\r\npreviously gained? Can it be that men who braved the perils of the\r\nocean, the privations of the wilderness, who fought the war of the\r\nRevolution, in the hour of their success, when all was sunshine and\r\npeace around them, came voluntarily forward to lay down that community\r\nindependence for which they had suffered so much and so long? Reason\r\nforbids it; but, if reason did not furnish a sufficient answer, the\r\naction of the States themselves forbids it. The great State of New\r\nYork--great, relatively, then, as she is now--manifested her wisdom in\r\nnot receiving merely that implication which belongs to the occasion,\r\nwhich was accepted by the other States, but she required the positive\r\nassertion of that retention of her sovereignty and power over all her\r\naffairs as the condition on which she ratified the Constitution itself.\r\nI read from Elliott's \"Debates\" (page 327). Among her resolutions of\r\nratification is the following:\r\n\r\n\"That the powers of government may be reassumed by the people whensoever\r\nit shall become necessary to their happiness; that every power,\r\njurisdiction, and right which is not by the said Constitution clearly\r\ndelegated to the Congress of the United States, or the departments of\r\nthe Government thereof, remain to the people of the several States, or\r\nto their respective State governments to which they may have granted the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina, with the Scotch caution which subsequent events have so\r\nwell justified, in 1788 passed this resolution:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That a declaration of rights, asserting and securing from\r\nencroachments the great principles of civil and religious liberty, and\r\nthe unalienable rights of the people, together with amendments to the\r\nmost ambiguous and exceptionable parts of the said Constitution of\r\nGovernment, ought to be laid before Congress and the convention of the\r\nStates that shall or may be called for the purpose of amending the said\r\nConstitution, for their consideration, previous to the ratification of\r\nthe Constitution aforesaid, on the part of the State of North Carolina.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in keeping with this North Carolina withheld her ratification; she\r\nallowed the Government to be formed with the number of States which was\r\nrequired to put it in operation, and still she remained out of the\r\nUnion, asserting and recognized in the independence which she had\r\nmaintained against Great Britain, and which she had no idea of\r\nsurrendering to any other power; and the last State which ratified the\r\nConstitution long after it had in fact gone into effect, Rhode Island,\r\nin the third of her resolutions, says:\r\n\r\n\"III. That the powers of government may be reassumed by the people\r\nwhensoever it shall become necessary to their happiness. That the rights\r\nof the States respectively to nominate and appoint all State officers,\r\nand every other power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by the said\r\nConstitution clearly delegated to the Congress of the United States, or\r\nthe departments of Government thereof, remain to the people of the\r\nseveral States, or their respective State governments to whom they may\r\nhave granted the same.\"\r\n\r\nHere the use of the phrase \"State governments\" shows how utterly\r\nunwarrantable the construction has been, to say that the reference here\r\nwas to the whole people of the States--to the people of all the\r\nStates--and not to the people of each of the States severally.\r\n\r\nI spoke, however, Mr. President, but a moment ago, of the difference of\r\npolitics, products, population, constituting the great motive for the\r\nUnion. It was, indeed, its necessity. Had all the people been alike--had\r\ntheir institutions all been the same--there would have been no interest\r\nto bring them together; there would have been no cause or necessity for\r\nany restraint being imposed upon them. It was the fact that they\r\ndiffered which rendered it necessary to have some law governing their\r\nintercourse. It was the fact that their products were opposite--that\r\ntheir pursuits were various--that rendered it the great interest of the\r\npeople that they should have free trade existing among each other; that\r\nfree trade which Franklin characterized as being between the States such\r\nas existed between the counties of England.\r\n\r\nSince that era, however, a fiber then unknown in the United States, and\r\nthe production of which is dependent upon the domestic institution of\r\nAfrican slavery, has come to be cultivated in such amounts, to enter so\r\ninto the wearing apparel of the world, so greatly to add to the comfort\r\nof the poor, that it may be said to-day that that little fiber, cotton,\r\nwraps the commercial world and binds it to the United States in bonds to\r\nkeep the peace with us which no Government dare break. It has built up\r\nthe Northern States. It is their great manufacturing interest to-day. It\r\nsupports their shipping abroad. It enables them to purchase in the\r\nmarkets of China, when the high premium to be paid on the milled dollar\r\nwould otherwise exclude them from that market. These are a part of the\r\nblessings resulting from that increase and variety of product which\r\ncould not have existed if we had all been alike; which would have been\r\nlost to-day unless free trade between the United States was still\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nAnd here it strikes me as somewhat strange that a book recently issued\r\nhas received the commendation of a large number of the representatives\r\nof the manufacturing and commercial States, though, apart from its\r\nfalsification of statistics and low abuse of Southern States,\r\ninstitutions, and interests, the great feature which stands prominently\r\nout from it is the arraignment of the South for using their surplus\r\nmoney in buying the manufactures of the North. How a manufacturing and\r\ncommercial people can be truly represented by those who would inculcate\r\nsuch doctrines as these, is to me passing strange. Is it vain boasting\r\nwhich renders you anxious to proclaim to the world that we buy our\r\nbuckets, our rakes, and our shovels from you? No, there is too much good\r\nsense in the people for that; and, therefore, I am left at a loss to\r\nunderstand the motive, unless it be that deep-rooted hate which makes\r\nyou blind to your own interest when that interest is weighed in the\r\nbalance with the denunciation and detraction of your brethren of the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nThe great principle which lay at the foundation of this fixed standard,\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, was the equality of rights\r\nbetween the States. This was essential; it was necessary; it was a step\r\nwhich had to be taken first, before any progress could be made. It was\r\nthe essential requisite of the very idea of sovereignty in the State; of\r\na compact voluntarily entered into between sovereigns; and it is that\r\nequality of right under the Constitution on which we now insist. But\r\nmore: when the States united they transferred their forts, their\r\narmament, their ships, and their right to maintain armies and navies, to\r\nthe Federal Government. It was the disarmament of the States, under the\r\noperation of a league which made the warlike operations, the powers of\r\ndefense, common to them all. Then, with this equality of the States,\r\nwith this disarmament of the States, if there had been nothing in the\r\nConstitution to express it, I say the protection of every constitutional\r\nright would follow as a necessary incident, and could not be denied by\r\nany one who could understand and would admit the true theory of such a\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nWe claim protection, first, because it is our right; secondly, because\r\nit is the duty of the General Government; and, thirdly, because we have\r\nentered into a compact together, which deprives each State of the power\r\nof using all the means which it might employ for its own defense. This\r\nis the general theory of the right of protection. What is the exception\r\nto it? Is there an exception? If so, who made it? Does the Constitution\r\ndiscriminate between different kinds of property? Did the Constitution\r\nattempt to assimilate the institutions of the different States\r\nconfederated together? Was there a single State in this Union that would\r\nhave been so unfaithful to the principles which had prompted them in\r\ntheir colonial position, and which had prompted them, at a still earlier\r\nperiod, to seek and try the temptations of the wilderness; is there one\r\nwhich would have consented to allow the Federal Government to control or\r\nto discriminate between her institutions and those of her confederate\r\nStates?\r\n\r\nBut, if it be contended that this is argument, and that you need\r\nauthority, I will draw it from the fountain; from the spring before it\r\nhad been polluted; from the debates in the formation of the\r\nConstitution; from the views of those who at least it will be admitted\r\nunderstood what they were doing.\r\n\r\nMr. Randolph, it will be recollected, introduced a _projet_ for a\r\nGovernment, consisting of a series of resolutions. Among them was one\r\nwhich proposed to give Congress the power \"to call forth the force of\r\nthe Union against any member of the Union failing to fulfill its duty\r\nunder the articles thereof.\" That was, to give Congress the power to\r\ncoerce the States; to bring the States into subjection to the Federal\r\nGovernment. Now, sir, let us see how that was treated; and first I will\r\nrefer to one whose wisdom, as we take a retrospective view, seems to me\r\nmarvelous. Not conspicuous in debate, at least not among the names which\r\nfirst occur when we think of that bright galaxy of patriots and\r\nstatesmen, he was the man who, above all others, it seems to me, laid\r\nhis finger upon every danger, and indicated the course which that danger\r\nwas to take. I refer to Mr. Mason.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Mason observed, not only that the present Confederation was\r\ndeficient in not providing for coercion and punishment against\r\ndelinquent States, but argued very cogently that punishment could not,\r\nin the nature of things, be executed on the States collectively; and,\r\ntherefore, that such a Government was necessary as could directly\r\noperate on individuals, and would punish those only whose guilt required\r\nit.\"[199]\r\n\r\nMr. Madison, who has been called sometimes the father of the\r\nConstitution, upon the same question, said:\r\n\r\n\"A union of the States containing such an ingredient seemed to provide\r\nfor its own destruction. The use of force against a State would look\r\nmore like a declaration of war than an infliction of punishment, and\r\nwould probably be considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of\r\nall previous compacts by which it might be bound.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton, who, if I were to express a judgment by way of comparison,\r\nI would say was the master intellect of the age in which he lived, whose\r\nmind seemed to penetrate profoundly every question with which he\r\ngrappled, and who seldom failed to exhaust the subject which he\r\ntreated--Mr. Hamilton, in speaking of the various powers necessary to\r\nmaintain a Government, came to clause four:\r\n\r\n\"4. Force, by which may be understood a _coercion of laws, or coercion\r\nof arms_. Congress have not the former, except in few cases. In\r\nparticular States, this coercion is nearly sufficient; though he held\r\nit, in most cases, not entirely so. A certain portion of military force\r\nis absolutely necessary in large communities. Massachusetts is now\r\nfeeling this necessity, and making provision for it. But how can this\r\nforce be exerted on the States collectively? It is impossible. It\r\namounts to a war between the parties. Foreign powers, also, will not be\r\nidle spectators. They will interpose; the confusion will increase; and a\r\ndissolution of the Union will ensue.\"\r\n\r\nThe consequence was, the proposition was lost. In support of this same\r\nidea of community independence, which I have suggested, the argument\r\nupon the proposition least likely to have exhibited it, that to give\r\npower to restrain the slave-trade, shows the Northern and Southern men\r\nall arguing and presenting different views, yet concurred in this, that\r\nthere could be no power to restrain a State from importing what she\r\npleased. As the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Collamer] looks somewhat\r\nsurprised at my statement, I will refer to the authority. Mr. Rutledge\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Religion and humanity had nothing to do with this question. Interest\r\nalone is the governing principle with nations. The true question at\r\npresent is, whether the Southern States shall or shall not be parties to\r\nthe Union. If the Northern States consult their interest, they will not\r\noppose the increase of slaves, which will increase the commodities of\r\nwhich they will become the carriers.\"[200]\r\n\r\nMr. Pinckney: \"South Carolina can never receive the plan if it prohibits\r\nthe slave-trade. In every proposed extension of the powers of Congress,\r\nthat State has expressly and watchfully excepted that of meddling with\r\nthe importation of negroes. If the States be all left at liberty on this\r\nsubject, South Carolina may, perhaps, by degrees, do of herself what is\r\nwished, as Virginia and Maryland already have done.\"[201]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sherman was for leaving the clause as it stands. He disapproved of\r\nthe slave-trade; yet, as the States were now possessed of the right to\r\nimport slaves, as the public good did not require it to be taken from\r\nthem, and as it was expedient to have as few objections as possible to\r\nthe proposed scheme of government, he thought it best to leave the\r\nmatter as we find it.\"[202]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Baldwin had conceived national objects alone to be before the\r\nConvention: not such as, like the present, were of a local nature.\r\nGeorgia was decided on this point. That State has always hitherto\r\nsupposed a General Government to be the pursuit of the central States,\r\nwho wished to have a vortex for everything; that her distance would\r\npreclude her from equal advantage; and that she could not prudently\r\npurchase it by yielding national powers. From this, it might be\r\nunderstood in what light she would view an attempt to abridge one of her\r\nfavorite prerogatives.\r\n\r\n\"If left to herself, she may probably put a stop to the evil. As one\r\nground for this conjecture, he took notice of the sect of ----, which,\r\nhe said was a respectable class of people who carried their ethics\r\nbeyond the mere _equality of men_, extending their humanity to the\r\nclaims of the whole animal creation.\"[203]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gerry thought we had nothing to do with the conduct of the States\r\nas to slaves, but ought to be careful not to give any sanction to\r\nit.\"[204]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. King thought the subject should be considered in a political light\r\nonly. If two States will not agree to the Constitution, as stated on one\r\nside, he could affirm with equal belief, on the other, that great and\r\nequal opposition would be experienced from the other States. He remarked\r\non the exemption of slaves from duty, while every other import was\r\nsubjected to it, as an inequality that could not fail to strike the\r\ncommercial sagacity of the Northern and Middle States.\"[205]\r\n\r\nHere, as will be observed, everywhere was recognized and admitted the\r\ndoctrine of community independence and State equality--no interference\r\nwith the institutions of a State--no interference even prospectively\r\nsave and except with their consent; and thus it followed that at one\r\ntime it was proposed to except, from the power to prohibit the further\r\nintroduction of Africans, those States which insisted upon retaining the\r\npower; and finally it was agreed that a date should be fixed beyond\r\nwhich, probably, none of them desired to retain it. These were States\r\nacting in their sovereign capacity; they possessed power to do as they\r\npleased; and that was the view which they took of it. I ask, then, how\r\nare we, their descendants, those holding under their authority, to\r\nassume a power which they refused to admit, upon principles eternal and\r\nlying at the foundation of the Constitution itself?\r\n\r\nIf, then, there be no such distinction or discrimination; if protection\r\nbe the duty (and who will deny it?) with which this Government is\r\ncharged, and for which the States pay taxes, because of which they\r\nsurrendered their armies and their navies; if general protection be the\r\ngeneral duty, I ask, in the name of reason and constitutional right--I\r\nask you to point me to authority by which a discrimination is made\r\nbetween slave-property and any other. Yet this is the question now\r\nfraught with evil to our country. It is this which has raised the\r\nhurricane threatening to sweep our political institutions before it.\r\nThis is the dark spot which some already begin to fear may blot out the\r\nconstellation of the Union from the political firmament of mankind. Does\r\nit not become us, then, calmly to consider it, justly to weigh it; to\r\nhold it in balances from which the dust has been blown, in order that we\r\nmay see where truth, right, and the obligations of the Constitution\r\nrequire us to go?\r\n\r\nIt may be pardoned to one who, from his earliest youth up, has been\r\nconnected with a particular party, who has always believed that the\r\nwelfare and the safety of the country most securely rested with that\r\nparty, who has seen in the triumph of Democracy the triumph of the\r\nUnion, and who has believed for years past that the downfall of\r\nDemocracy would be its destruction--it may be pardoned, I say, under\r\nsuch circumstances as these, to such a person as that, to refer even in\r\nthis connection to that feature of the particular point which I am\r\ndiscussing, which has been brought forward by the recent action of that\r\nparty. States met together to consult as brethren, to see whether they\r\ncould agree as well upon the candidate as upon the creed, and it was\r\napparent that division had entered into our ranks. After days of\r\ndiscussion, we saw that party convention broken. We saw the enemies of\r\nDemocracy waiting to be invited to its funeral, and jestingly looking\r\ninto the blank faces of those of us to whom the telegraph brought the\r\nsad intelligence. I hope this is, however, but the mist of the morning.\r\nI have faith in the Democracy, and that it still lives. I have faith in\r\nthe patriotism and in the good sense of the Democracy, that they will\r\nassert the truth, boldly pronounce it, meet the issue, and I trust in\r\nthe good sense and patriotism of the people for their success.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, it may be permissible to review our present party\r\ncondition. For a long time two parties divided the people of the United\r\nStates. The controversy was mainly upon questions of expediency;\r\nsometimes of constitutionality. They divided men in all of the States.\r\nThe contest was sometimes won by one, and sometimes by the other. The\r\nWhig party lives now but in history, yet it has a history of which any\r\nof its members may be proud. It bore the high but not successful part of\r\nstemming the tide of popular impulse, and thus failed to attain the\r\nhighest power. Differing from them upon the points at issue, I offer the\r\nhomage of my respect to those who, adhering to what they believed to be\r\ntrue, go down sooner than find success in the abandonment of principle.\r\nWith the disappearance of that party--and perhaps for the very reasons\r\nthat caused its disappearance--up rose radical organizations who strode\r\nso far beyond progressive Democracy that Democracy took the place now\r\nleft vacant by the old Whig party, and became the reservoir into which\r\nall conservatism was poured. Therefore it is that so many of those men,\r\neminent in their day, eminent for their services, eminent in their\r\nhistory, have approved of the Democratic party in the present condition\r\nof the country as the only conservative element which remains in our\r\npolitics. In the midst of this radicalism, of this revolutionary\r\ntendency, it becomes not the regret of a partisan merely; it is the\r\nsadness of an American citizen, that the party on which the conservative\r\nhopes of the country hang has been threatened with division, and\r\npossibly may not hereafter be united. Thanks to a sanguine temperament,\r\nthanks to an abiding faith, thanks to a confidence in the Providence\r\nwhich has so long ruled for good the destiny of my country, I believe it\r\nwill reunite, and reunite upon sound and acceptable principles. At\r\nleast, I hope so.\r\n\r\nFrom the postulates which I have laid down result the fourth and fifth\r\nresolutions. They are the two which I expect to be opposed. They contain\r\nthe assertion of the equality of rights of all the people of the United\r\nStates in the Territories, and they declare the obligation of the\r\nCongress to see these rights protected. I admit that the United States\r\nmay acquire eminent domain. I admit that the United States may have\r\nsovereignty over territory; otherwise the sovereign jurisdiction which\r\nwe obtained by conquest or treaty would not pass to us. I deny that\r\ntheir agent, the Federal Government, under the existing Constitution,\r\ncan have eminent domain; I deny that it can have sovereignty. I consider\r\nit as the mere agent of the States--an agent of limited power; and that\r\nit can do nothing save that which the Constitution empowers it to\r\nperform; and that, though the treaty or the deed of cession may direct\r\nor control, it can not enlarge or expand the powers of the Congress;\r\nthat it is not sovereign in any essential particular. It has functions\r\nto perform, and those functions I propose now to consider.\r\n\r\nThe power of Congress over the Territories--a subject not well defined\r\nin the Constitution of the United States--has been drawn from various\r\nsources by different advocates of that power. One has found it in the\r\ngrant of power to dispose of the Territory and other public property.\r\nThat is to say, because the agent was authorized to sell a particular\r\nthing, or to dispose of it by grant or barter, therefore he has\r\nsovereign power over that and all else which the principal, constituting\r\nhim an agent, may hereafter acquire! The property, besides the land,\r\nconsisted of forts, of ships, of armaments, and other things which had\r\nbelonged to the States in their separate capacity, and were turned over\r\nto the Government of the Confederation, and transferred to the\r\nGovernment of the United States, and of this, together with the land so\r\ntransferred, the Federal Government had the power to dispose; and of\r\nterritory thereafter acquired, of arms thereafter made or purchased, of\r\nforts thereafter constructed, or custom-houses, or docks, or lights, or\r\nbuoys; of all these, of course, it had power to dispose. It had the\r\npower to create them; it must, of necessity, have had the power to\r\ndispose of them. It was only necessary to confer the power to dispose of\r\nthose things which the Federal Government did not create, of those\r\nthings which came to it from the States, and over which they might\r\nsignify their will for its control.\r\n\r\nI look upon it as the mere power to dispose of, for considerations and\r\nobjects defined in the trust, the land held in the United States, none\r\nof which then was within the limits of the States, and the other public\r\nproperty which the United States received from the States after the\r\nformation of the Union. I do not agree with those who say the Government\r\nhas no power to establish a temporary and civil government within a\r\nTerritory. I stand half-way between the extremes of squatter sovereignty\r\nand of Congressional sovereignty. I hold that the Congress has power to\r\nestablish a civil government; that it derives it from the grants of the\r\nConstitution--not the one which is referred to; and I hold that that\r\npower is limited and restrained, first, by the Constitution itself, and\r\nthen by every rule of popular liberty and sound discretion, to the\r\nnarrowest limits which the necessities of the case require. The Congress\r\nhas power to defend the territory, to repel invasion, to suppress\r\ninsurrection; the Congress has power to see the laws executed. For this\r\nit may have a civil magistracy--territorial courts. It has the power to\r\nestablish a Federal judiciary. To that Federal judiciary, from these\r\nlocal courts, may come up to be decided questions with regard to the\r\nlaws of the United States and the Constitution of the United States.\r\nThese, combined, give power to establish a temporary government,\r\nsufficient, perhaps, for the simple wants of the inhabitants of a\r\nTerritory, until they shall acquire the population, until they shall\r\nhave the resources and the interests which justify them in becoming a\r\nState. I am sustained in this view of the case by an opinion of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States in 1845, in the case of Pollard's\r\nLessee _vs_. P. Hagan (3 Howard, 222, 223), in which the Court say:\r\n\r\n\"Taking the legislative acts of the United States, and the States of\r\nVirginia and Georgia, and their deeds of cession to the United States,\r\nand giving to each separately, and to all jointly, a fair\r\ninterpretation, we must come to the conclusion that it was the intention\r\nof the parties to invest the United States with the eminent domain of\r\nthe country ceded, both national and municipal, for the purposes of\r\ntemporary government; and to hold it in trust for the performance of the\r\nstipulations and conditions expressed in the deeds of cession and the\r\nlegislative acts connected with them.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a question of land. It was land lying between high and low\r\nwater, over which the United States claimed to have and to exercise\r\nauthority, because of the terms on which Alabama had been admitted into\r\nthe Union. In that connection the Court say, in the same case:\r\n\r\n\"When Alabama was admitted into the Union, on an equal footing with the\r\noriginal States, she succeeded to all the rights of sovereignty,\r\njurisdiction, and eminent domain which Georgia possessed at the date of\r\nthe cession, except so far as this right was diminished by the public\r\nlands remaining in the possession and under the control of the United\r\nStates for the temporary purpose provided for in the deeds of cession\r\nand the legislative acts connected with it. Nothing remained in the\r\nUnited States, according to the terms of the agreement, but the public\r\nlands; and if an express stipulation had been inserted in the agreement,\r\ngranting the municipal right of sovereignty and eminent domain to the\r\nUnited States, such stipulation would have been void and inoperative;\r\nbecause the United States has no constitutional capacity to exercise\r\nmunicipal jurisdiction, sovereignty, or eminent domain within the limits\r\nof a State or elsewhere, except in the cases in which it is expressly\r\ngranted.\"\r\n\r\nAnother case arose not long afterward, in which not land, but religion,\r\nwas involved, where suit was brought against the municipality of New\r\nOrleans because they would not allow a dead body to be exposed at a\r\nplace where, according to the religious rites of those interested, it\r\nwas deemed they had a right thus to expose it. On that the Supreme Court\r\nsay, speaking of the ordinance for the government of Louisiana:\r\n\r\n\"So far as they conferred political rights and secured civil and\r\nreligious liberties (which are political rights) the laws of Congress\r\nwere all suspended by the State Constitution; nor is any part of them in\r\nforce, unless they were adopted by the Constitution of Louisiana, as\r\nlaws of the State.\"[206]\r\n\r\nThus we find the Supreme Court sustaining the proposition that the\r\nFederal Government has power to establish a temporary civil government\r\nwithin the limits of a Territory, but that it can enact no law which\r\nwill endure beyond the temporary purposes for which such government was\r\nestablished. In other cases the decisions of the Court run in the same\r\nline; and in 1855 the then Attorney-General, most learned in his\r\nprofession--and in what else is he not learned, for he may be said to be\r\na man of universal acquirements?--Attorney-General Cushing then foretold\r\nwhat must have been the decision of the Supreme Court on the Missouri\r\nCompromise, anticipating the decision subsequently made in the case of\r\nDred Scott; that decision for which the venerable justices have been so\r\noften and so violently arraigned. He foretold it as the necessary\r\nconsequence from the line of precedents descending from 1842, affirmed\r\nand reaffirmed in different cases, and now bearing on a case similar in\r\nprinciple, and only different in the mere reference to the subject\r\ninvolved from those which had gone before. As connected with the\r\ndecision which had agitated the peace of the country; as the\r\nanticipation of that decision before it was made, viewing it as the\r\nnecessary consequence of the decisions which the court had made before;\r\nif it be the pleasure of the Senate, I ask my friend from South Carolina\r\n[Mr. Chesnut] to read for me a letter of the Attorney-General, being an\r\nofficial answer made by him in relation to the military reservation\r\nwhich was involved in the question before him.\r\n\r\nMr. Chesnut read from the \"Opinions of the Attorneys-General,\" vol. vii,\r\npage 575:\r\n\r\n\"The Supreme Court has determined that the United States never held any\r\nmunicipal sovereignty, jurisdiction, or right of soil in the territory\r\nof which any of the new States have been formed, except for temporary\r\npurposes, and to execute the trusts created by the deeds of cession....\r\n\r\n\"By the force of the same principle, and in the same line of\r\nadjudications, the Supreme Court would have had to decide that the\r\nprovision of the act of March 6, 1820, which undertakes to determine in\r\nadvance the municipal law of all that portion of the original province\r\nof Louisiana which lies north of the parallel 36° 30' north latitude,\r\nwas null and void _ab incepto_, if it had not been repealed by a recent\r\nact of Congress. (Compare iv, Statutes at Large, p. 848, and x, Statutes\r\nat Large, p. 289.) For an act of Congress which pretends of right, and\r\nwithout consent or compact, to impose on the municipal power of any new\r\nState or States limitations and restrictions not imposed on all, is\r\ncontrary to the fundamental condition of the Confederation, according to\r\nwhich there is to be equality of right between the old and new States\r\n'in all respects whatsoever.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davis: It was not long after this official opinion of the\r\nAttorney-General before the case arose on which the decision was made\r\nwhich has so agitated the country. Fortunate indeed was it for the\r\npublic peace that land and religion had been decided--those questions on\r\nwhich men might reason had been the foundation of judicial\r\ndecision--before that which drives all reason, it seems, from the mind\r\nof man, came to be presented the question whether Cuffee should be kept\r\nin his normal condition or not; the question whether the Congress of the\r\nUnited States could decide what might or might not be property in a\r\nTerritory--the case being that of an officer of the army sent into a\r\nTerritory to perform his public duty, having taken with him his negro\r\nslave. The court, however, in giving their decision in this case--or\r\ntheir opinion, if it suits gentlemen better--have gone into the question\r\nwith such clearness, such precision, and such amplitude, that it will\r\nrelieve me from the necessity of arguing it any further than to make a\r\nreference to some sentences contained in that opinion. And here let me\r\nsay, I can not see how those who agreed on a former occasion that the\r\nconstitutional right of the slaveholder to take his property into the\r\nTerritory--the constitutional power of the Congress and the\r\nconstitutional power of the Territory to legislate upon that\r\nsubject--should be a judicial question, can now attempt to escape the\r\noperation of an opinion which covers the exact political question which,\r\nit was known beforehand, the Court would be called upon to decide.\r\nDecided in strictness of technical language, it was known it could not\r\nbe. Hundreds, thousands, a vast variety of cases may arise, and\r\ncenturies elapse, and leave that Court, if our Union still exists,\r\ndeciding questions in relation to that character of property in the\r\nTerritories; but the great and fundamental idea was that, after thirty\r\nyears of angry controversy, dividing the people and paralyzing the arm\r\nof the Federal Government, some umpire should be sought which would\r\ncompose the difficulty and set it upon a footing to leave us in future\r\nto proceed in peace; and that umpire was selected which the Constitution\r\nhad provided to decide questions of law. I ask my friend to read some\r\nextracts from the decision.\r\n\r\nMr. Chesnut read as follows, from the case of Dred Scott _vs._ Sandford,\r\npp. 55-57:\r\n\r\n\"The Territory being a part of the United States, the Government and the\r\ncitizen both enter it under the authority of the Constitution, with\r\ntheir respective rights defined and marked out; and the Federal\r\nGovernment can exercise no power over his person or property beyond what\r\nthat instrument confers, nor lawfully deny any right which it has\r\nreserved....\r\n\r\n\"The powers over person and property, of which we speak, are not only\r\nnot granted to Congress, but are in express terms denied, and they are\r\nforbidden to exercise them. And this prohibition is not confined to the\r\nStates, but the words are general, and extend to the whole territory\r\nover which the Constitution gives it power to legislate, including those\r\nportions of it remaining under territorial government, as well as that\r\ncovered by States. It is a total absence of power everywhere within the\r\ndominion of the United States, and places the citizens of a Territory,\r\nso far as these rights are concerned, on the same footing with citizens\r\nof the States, and guards them as firmly and plainly against any inroads\r\nwhich the General Government might attempt under the plea of implied or\r\nincidental powers. And if Congress itself can not do this--if it is\r\nbeyond the powers conferred on the Federal Government--it will be\r\nadmitted, we presume, that it could not authorize a territorial\r\ngovernment to exercise them. It could confer no power on any local\r\ngovernment, established by its authority, to violate the provisions of\r\nthe Constitution....\r\n\r\n\"And if the Constitution recognizes the right of property of the master\r\nin the slave, and makes no distinction between that description of\r\nproperty and other property owned by a citizen, no tribunal, acting\r\nunder the authority of the United States, whether it be legislative,\r\nexecutive, or judicial, has a right to draw such a distinction, or deny\r\nto it the benefit of the provisions and guarantees which have been\r\nprovided for the protection of private property against the\r\nencroachments of the Government....\r\n\r\n\"This is done in plain words--too plain to be misunderstood. And no word\r\ncan be found in the Constitution which gives Congress a greater power\r\nover slave-property, or which entitles property of that kind to less\r\nprotection than property of any other description. The only power\r\nconferred is the power coupled with the duty of guarding and protecting\r\nthe owner in his rights.\r\n\r\n\"Upon these considerations, it is the opinion of the Court that the act\r\nof Congress which prohibited a citizen from holding and owning property\r\nof this kind, in the territory of the United States north of the line\r\ntherein mentioned, is not warranted by the Constitution, and is\r\ntherefore void; and that neither Dred Scott himself, nor any of his\r\nfamily, were made free by being carried into this territory, even if\r\nthey had been carried there by the owner, with the intention of becoming\r\na permanent resident.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davis: Here, then, Mr. President, I say the umpire selected as the\r\nreferee in the controversy has decided that neither the Congress nor its\r\nagent, the territorial government, has the power to invade or impair the\r\nright of property within the limits of a Territory. I will not inquire\r\nwhether it be technically a decision or not. It was obligatory on those\r\nwho selected the umpire and agreed to abide by the award.\r\n\r\nIt is well known to those who have been associated with me in the two\r\nHouses of Congress that, from the commencement of the question, I have\r\nbeen the determined opponent of what is called squatter sovereignty. I\r\nnever gave it countenance, and I am now least of all disposed to give it\r\nquarter. In 1848 it made its appearance for good purposes. It was\r\nushered in by a great and good man. He brought it forward because of\r\nthat distrust which he had in the capacity of the Government to bear the\r\nrude shock to which it was exposed. His apprehension, no doubt, to some\r\nextent sharpened and directed his patriotism, and his reflection led him\r\nto a conclusion to which, I doubt not, to-day he adheres as tenaciously\r\nas ever; but from which it was my fortune, good or ill, to dissent when\r\nhis letter was read to me in manuscript--I being, together with some\r\nother persons, asked, though not by the writer, whether or not it should\r\nbe sent. At the first blush I believed it to be a fallacy--a fallacy\r\nfraught with mischief; that it escaped an issue which was upon us which\r\nit was our duty to meet; that it escaped it by a side path, which led to\r\na greater danger. I thought it a fallacy which would surely be exploded.\r\nI doubted then, and still more for some time afterward, when held to a\r\ndread responsibility for the position which I occupied. I doubted\r\nwhether I should live to see that fallacy exploded. It has been more\r\nspeedily, and, to the country, more injuriously than I anticipated. In\r\nthe mean time, what has been its operation? Let Kansas speak--the first\r\ngreat field on which the trial was made. What was then the consequence?\r\nThe Federal Government withdrawing control, leaving the contending\r\nsections, excited to the highest point upon this question, each to send\r\nforth its army, Kansas became the battle-field, and Kansas the cry,\r\nwhich wellnigh led to civil war. This was the first fruit. More deadly\r\nthan the fatal upas, its effect was not limited to the mere spot of\r\nground on which the dew fell from its leaves, but it spread throughout\r\nthe United States; it kindled all which had been collected for years of\r\ninflammable material. It was owing to the strength of our Government and\r\nthe good sense of the quiet masses of the people that it did not wrap\r\nour country in one widespread conflagration.\r\n\r\nWhat right had Congress then, or what right has it now, to abdicate any\r\npower conferred upon it as trustee of the States? What right had\r\nCongress then, or has it now, to shrink from the performance of a duty\r\nbecause the mere counters spread on the table may be swept off, when\r\nthey have not answered the purposes for which they were placed? What is\r\nit to you, or me, or any one, when we weigh our own continuation in\r\nplace against the great interests of which we are conservators; against\r\nthe welfare of the country, and the liberty of our posterity to the\r\nremotest ages? What is it, I say, which can be counted in the balance on\r\nour side against the performance of that duty which is imposed upon us?\r\nIf any one believes Congress has not the constitutional power, he acts\r\nconscientiously in insisting upon Congress not usurping it. If any one\r\nbelieves that the squatters upon the lands of the United States within a\r\nTerritory are invested with sovereignty, having won it by some of those\r\nprocesses unknown to history, without grant, or without revolution,\r\nwithout money and without price, he, adhering to the theory, may pursue\r\nit to its conclusion. To the first class, those who claim sovereign\r\npower over the Territories for Congress, I say, lay your hand upon the\r\nConstitution, and find there the warrant of your authority. Of the\r\nsecond, those of whom I have last spoken, I ask, in the Constitution,\r\nreason, right, or justice, what is there to sustain your theory?\r\n\r\nThe phraseology which has been employed on this question seems to me to\r\nbetray a strange confusion of ideas--to speak of a sovereignty, a\r\nplenary legislative power deriving its power from an agent; a\r\nsovereignty, held subject to articles with the formation of which that\r\nsovereignty had nothing to do; a compact to which it was not a party!\r\nYou say to a sovereign: \"A and B have agreed on certain terms between\r\nthemselves, and you must govern your conduct according to them; yet I do\r\nnot deny your sovereignty!\" That is, the power to do as they please,\r\nprovided it conforms to the rule which others chose to lay down! Can\r\nthis be a definition of sovereignty?\r\n\r\nBut again, sir, nothing seems to me more illogical than the argument\r\nthat this power is acquired by a grant from the Congress, connected with\r\nthe other argument that Congress have not got the power to do the act\r\nthemselves; that is to say, that the recipient takes more than the giver\r\npossessed; that a Territorial Legislature can do anything which a State\r\nLegislature can do, and that \"subject to the Constitution\" means merely\r\nthe restraints imposed upon both. This is confounding the whole theory\r\nand the history of our Government. The States were the grantors; they\r\nmade the compact; they gave the Federal agent its powers; they inhibited\r\nthemselves from doing certain things, and all else they retained to\r\nthemselves. This Federal agent got just so much as the States chose to\r\ngive--no more. It could do nothing save by warrant of the authority of\r\nthe grant made by the States. Therefore its powers are not comparable to\r\nthe powers of the State Legislature, because one is the creature of\r\ngrant, and the other the exponent of sovereign power. The Supreme Court\r\nhave covered the whole ground of the relation of the Congress to the\r\nTerritorial Legislatures--the agent of the States and the agent of the\r\nCongress--and the restrictions put upon the one are those put upon the\r\nother, in language so clear as to render it needless further to labor\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, following the promulgation of this notion of squatter\r\nsovereignty, we had the idea of non-intervention introduced into the\r\nSenate of the United States, and it is strange to me how that idea has\r\nexpanded. It seems to have been more malleable than gold; to have been\r\nhammered out to an extent that covers boundless regions undiscovered by\r\nthose who proclaimed the doctrine. Non-intervention then meant, as the\r\ndebates show, that Congress should neither prohibit nor establish\r\nslavery in the Territories. That I hold to now. Will any one suppose\r\nthat Congress then meant by non-intervention that Congress should\r\nlegislate in no regard in respect to property in slaves? Why, sir, the\r\nvery acts which they passed at the time refute it. There is the fugitive\r\nslave law, and that abomination of laws which assumed to confiscate the\r\nproperty of a citizen who should attempt to bring it into this District\r\nwith intent to remove it to sell it at some other time and at some other\r\nplace. Congress acted then upon the subject--acted beyond the limit of\r\nits authority, as I believed, confidently believed; and, if ever that\r\nact comes before the Supreme Court, I feel satisfied they will declare\r\nit null and void. Are we to understand that those men, thus acting at\r\nthe very moment, intended by non-intervention to deny and repudiate the\r\nlaws they were then creating? The man who stood most prominently the\r\nadvocate of the measures of that year, who, great in many periods of our\r\nhistory, perhaps shone then with the brightest light his genius ever\r\nemitted--I refer to Henry Clay--has given his own view on this subject;\r\nand I suppose he may be considered as the highest authority. On June 18,\r\n1850, I had introduced an amendment to the compromise bill, providing:\r\n\r\n\"And that all laws, or parts of laws, usages, or customs, preëxisting in\r\nthe Territories acquired by the United States from Mexico, and which in\r\nsaid Territories restrict, abridge, or obstruct, the full enjoyment of\r\nany right of person or property of a citizen of the United States, as\r\nrecognized or guaranteed by the Constitution or laws of the United\r\nStates, are hereby declared and shall be held as repealed.\"\r\n\r\nUpon that, Mr. Clay said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President: I thought that upon this subject there had been a clear\r\nunderstanding in the Senate that the Senate would not decide itself upon\r\nthe _lex loci_ as it respects slavery; that the Senate would not allow\r\nthe Territorial Legislature to pass any law upon that question. In other\r\nwords, that it would leave the operation of the local law, or of the\r\nConstitution of the United States upon that local law, to be decided by\r\nthe proper and competent tribunal--the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates.\"--(_Appendix to Congressional Globe_, Thirty-first Congress,\r\nfirst session, p. 916.)\r\n\r\nThat was the position taken by Mr. Clay, the leader. A mere sentence\r\nwill show with what view I regarded the dogma of non-intervention when\r\nthat amendment was offered. I said:\r\n\r\n\"But what is non-intervention seems to vary as often as the light and\r\nshade of every fleeting cloud. It has different meanings in every State,\r\nin every county, in every town. If non-intervention means that we shall\r\nnot have protection for our property in slaves, then I always was, and\r\nalways shall be, opposed to it. If it means that we shall not have the\r\nprotection of the law because it would favor slaveholders, that Congress\r\nshall not legislate so as to secure to us the benefits of the\r\nConstitution, then I am opposed to non-intervention, and shall always be\r\nopposed to it.\"--(_Appendix to Congressional Globe_, Thirty-first\r\nCongress, first session, p. 919.)\r\n\r\nMr. Downs, one of the Committee of Thirteen, and an advocate of the\r\nmeasures, said:\r\n\r\n\"What I understand by non-intervention is, an interposition of Congress\r\nprohibiting, or establishing, or interfering with slavery.\"--(_Appendix\r\nto Congressional Globe_, Thirty-first Congress, first session, p. 99.)\r\n\r\nBy what species of legerdemain this doctrine of non-intervention has\r\ncome to extend to a paralysis of the Government on the whole subject, to\r\nexclude the Congress from any kind of legislation whatever, I am at a\r\nloss to conceive. Certain it is, it was not the theory of that period,\r\nand it was not contended for in all the controversies we had then. I had\r\nno faith in it then; I considered it an evasion; I held that the duty of\r\nCongress ought to be performed; that the issue was before us, and ought\r\nto be met, the sooner the better; that truth would prevail if presented\r\nto the people; borne down to-day, it would rise up to-morrow; and I\r\nstood then on the same general plea which I am making now. The Senator\r\nfrom Illinois [Mr. Douglas] and myself differed at that time, as I\r\npresume we do now. We differed radically then. He opposed every\r\nproposition which I made, voting against propositions to give power to a\r\nTerritorial Legislature to protect slave-property which should be taken\r\nthere; to remove the obstructions of the Mexican laws; voting for a\r\nproposition to exclude the conclusion that slavery might be taken there;\r\nvoting for the proposition expressly to prohibit its introduction;\r\nvoting for the proposition to keep in force the laws of Mexico which\r\nprohibited it. Some of these votes, it is but just to him I should say,\r\nI think he gave perforce of his instructions; but others of them, I\r\nthink it is equally fair to suppose, were outside of the limits of any\r\ninstructions which could have been given before the fact.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, advancing in this same general line of thought, the Congress,\r\nin enacting territorial bills, left out a provision which had before\r\nbeen usually contained in them, requiring the Legislature of the\r\nTerritory to submit its laws to the Congress of the United States. It\r\nhas been sometimes assumed that this was the recognition of the power of\r\nthe Territorial Legislature to exercise plenary legislation, as might\r\nthat of a State. It will be remembered that, when our present form of\r\ngovernment was instituted, there were those who believed the Federal\r\nGovernment should have the power of revision over the laws of a State.\r\nIt was long and ably contended for in the Convention which formed the\r\nConstitution; and one of the compromises which was made was an appellate\r\npower--to lodge power in the Supreme Court to decide all questions of\r\nconstitutional law.\r\n\r\nBut did this omission of the obligation to send here the laws of the\r\nTerritories work this grant of power to the Territorial Legislature?\r\nCertainly not; it could not; and that it did not is evinced by the fact\r\nthat, at a subsequent period, the organic act was revised because the\r\nlegislation of the Territory of Kansas was offensive to the Congress of\r\nthe United States. Congress could not abdicate its authority; it could\r\nnot abandon its trust; and, when it omitted the requirement that the\r\nlaws should be sent back, it created a _casus_ which required it to act\r\nwithout the official records being laid before it, as they would have\r\nbeen if the obligation had existed. That was all the difference. It was\r\nnot enforcing upon the agent the obligation to send the information. It\r\nleft Congress, as to its power, just where it was. I find myself\r\nphysically unable to go as fully into the subject as I intended, and\r\ntherefore, omitting a reference to those acts, suffice it to say that\r\nhere was the recognition of the obligation of Congress to interpose\r\nagainst a Territorial Legislature for the protection of personal right.\r\nThat is what we ask of Congress now. I am not disposed to ask this\r\nCongress to go into speculative legislation. I am not one of those who\r\nwould willingly see this Congress enact a code to be applied to all\r\nTerritories and for all time to come. I only ask that cases, as they\r\narise, may be met according to the exigency. I ask that when personal\r\nand property rights in the Territories are not protected, then the\r\nCongress, by existing laws and governmental machinery, shall intervene\r\nand provide such means as will secure in each case, as far as may be, an\r\nadequate remedy. I ask no slave code, nor horse code, nor machine code.\r\nI ask that the Territorial Legislature be made to understand beforehand\r\nthat the Congress of the United States does not concede to them the\r\npower to interfere with the rights of person or property guaranteed by\r\nthe Constitution, and that it will apply the remedy, if the Territorial\r\nLegislature should so far forget its duty, so far transcend its power,\r\nas to commit that violation of right. That is the announcement of the\r\nfifth resolution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese are the general views which I entertain of our right of protection\r\nand the duty of the Government. They are those which are entertained by\r\nthe constituency I have the honor to represent, whose delegation has\r\nrecently announced those principles at Charleston. I honor them, and I\r\napprove their conduct. I think their bearing was worthy of the\r\nmother-State which sent them there; and I doubt not she will receive\r\nthem with joy and gratitude. They have asserted and vindicated her\r\nequality of right. By that asserted equality of right I doubt not she\r\nwill stand. For weal or for woe, for prosperity or adversity, for the\r\npreservation of the great blessings which we enjoy, or the trial of a\r\nnew and separate condition, I trust Mississippi never will surrender the\r\nsmallest atom of the sovereignty, independence, and equality, to which\r\nshe was born, to avoid any danger or any sacrifice to which she may\r\nhereby be exposed.\r\n\r\nThe sixth resolution of the series declares at what time a State may\r\nform a Constitution and decide upon her domestic institutions. I deny\r\nthis right to the territorial condition, because the Territory belongs\r\nin common to the States. Every citizen of the United States, as a joint\r\nowner of that Territory, has a right to go into it with any property\r\nwhich he may possess. These territorial inhabitants require municipal\r\nlaw, police, and government. They should have them, but they should be\r\nrestricted to their own necessities. They have no right within their\r\nmunicipal power to attempt to decide the rights of the people of the\r\nStates. They have no right to exclude any citizen of the United States\r\nfrom owning and equally enjoying this common possession; it is for the\r\npurpose of preserving order, and giving protection to rights of person\r\nand property, that a municipal territorial government should be\r\ninstituted.\r\n\r\nThe last resolution refers to a law founded on a provision of the\r\nConstitution, which contains an obligation of faith to every State of\r\nthe Union; and that obligation of faith has been violated by thirteen\r\nStates of the Confederacy--as many as originally fought the battles of\r\nthe Revolution and established the Confederation. Is it to be expected\r\nthat a compact thus broken in part, violated in its important features,\r\nwill be regarded as binding in all else? Is the free trade which the\r\nNorth sought in the formation of the Union, and for which the States\r\ngenerally agreed to give Congress the power to regulate commerce, to be\r\ntrampled under foot by laws of obstruction, not giving to the citizens\r\nof the South that free transit across the territory of the Northern\r\nStates which we might claim from any friendly state under Christendom;\r\nand is Congress to stand powerless by, on the doctrine of\r\nnon-intervention? We have a right to claim abstinence from interference\r\nwith our rights from any Government on the earth. Shall we claim no more\r\nfrom that which we have constituted for our own purposes, and which we\r\nsupport by draining our own means for its support?\r\n\r\nWe have had agitation, changing in its form, and gathering intensity,\r\nfor the last forty years. It was first for political power, and directed\r\nagainst new States; now it has assumed a social form, is all-prevailing,\r\nand has reached the point of revolution and civil war. For it was only\r\nlast fall that an overt act was committed by men who were sustained by\r\narms and money, raised by extensive combination among the\r\nnon-slaveholding States, to carry treasonable war against the State of\r\nVirginia, because now, as before the Revolution, and ever since, she\r\nheld the African in bondage. This is part of the history and marks the\r\nnecessity of the times. It warns us to stop and reflect, to go back to\r\nthe original standard, to measure our acts by the obligation of our\r\nfathers, by the pledges they made one to the other, to see whether we\r\nare conforming to our plighted faith, and to ask seriously, solemnly,\r\nlooking each other inquiringly in the face, what we should do to save\r\nour country.\r\n\r\nThis agitation being at first one of sectional pride for political\r\npower, has at last degenerated or grown up to (as you please) a trade.\r\nThere are men who habitually set aside a portion of money which they are\r\nannually to apply to what are called \"charitable purposes\"--that is to\r\nsay, so far as I understand it, to support some vagrant lecturer, whose\r\npurpose is agitation and mischief wherever he goes. This constitutes,\r\ntherefore, a trade; a class of people are thus employed--employed for\r\nmischief, for incendiary purposes, perhaps not always understood by\r\nthose who furnish the money; but such is the effect; such is the result\r\nof their action; and in this state of the case I call upon the Senate to\r\naffirm the great principles on which our institutions rest. In no spirit\r\nof crimination have I stated the reasons why I present it. For these\r\nreasons I call upon them now to restrain the growth of evil passion, and\r\nto bring back the public sense as far as in them lies, by earnest and\r\nunited effort, if it may be, to crown our country with peace, and start\r\nit once more in its primal channel on a career of progressive prosperity\r\nand justice.\r\n\r\nThe majority section can not be struggling for additional power in order\r\nto preserve their rights. If any of them ever believed in what is called\r\nSouthern aggression, they know now they have the majority in the\r\nrepresentative districts and in the electoral college. They can not,\r\ntherefore, fear an invasion of their rights. They need no additional\r\npolitical power to protect them from that. The argument, then, or the\r\nreason on which this agitation commenced, has passed away; and yet we\r\nare asked, if a party hostile to our institutions shall gain possession\r\nof the Government, that we shall stand quietly by, and wait for an overt\r\nact. Overt act! Is not a declaration of war an overt act? What would be\r\nthought of a country that, after a declaration of war, and while the\r\nenemy's fleets were upon the sea, should wait until a city had been\r\nsacked before it would say that war existed, or resistance should be\r\nmade? The power of resistance consists, in no small degree, in meeting\r\nthe evil at the outer gate. I can speak for myself--and I have no right\r\nto speak for others--when I say, that, if I belonged to a party\r\norganized on the basis of making war on any section or interest in the\r\nUnited States, if I know myself, I would instantly quit it. We have made\r\nno war against you. We have asked no discrimination in our favor. We\r\nclaim to have but the Constitution fairly and equally administered. To\r\nconsent to less than this would be to sink in the scale of manhood;\r\nwould be to make our posterity so degraded that they would curse this\r\ngeneration for robbing them of the rights their Revolutionary fathers\r\nbequeathed them....\r\n\r\nAmong the great purposes declared in the preamble of the Constitution is\r\none to provide for the general welfare. Provision for the general\r\nwelfare implies general fraternity. This Union was not expected to be\r\nheld together by coercion; the power of force as a means was denied.\r\nThey sought, however, to bind it perpetually together with that which\r\nwas stronger than triple bars of brass and steel--the ceaseless current\r\nof kind offices, renewing and renewed in an eternal flow, and gathering\r\nvolume and velocity as it rolled. It was a function intended not for the\r\ninjury of any. It declared its purpose to be the benefit of all.\r\nConcessions which were made between the different States in the\r\nConvention prove the motive. Each gave to the other what was necessary\r\nto it; what each could afford to spare. Young as a nation, our triumphs\r\nunder this system have had no parallel in human history. We have tamed a\r\nwilderness; we have spanned a continent. We have built up a granary that\r\nsecures the commercial world against the fear of famine. Higher than all\r\nthis, we have achieved a moral triumph. We have received, by hundreds of\r\nthousands, a constant tide of immigrants--energetic, if not well\r\neducated, fleeing, some from want, some from oppression, some from the\r\npenalties of violated law--received them into our society; and by the\r\ngentle suasion of a Government which exhibits no force, by removing want\r\nand giving employment, they have subsided into peaceful citizens, and\r\nhave increased the wealth and power of our country.\r\n\r\nIf, then, this temple so blessed, and to the roof of which we were about\r\nto look to see it extended over the continent, giving a protecting arm\r\nto infant republics that need it--if this temple is tottering on its\r\npillars, what, I ask, can be a higher or nobler duty for the Senate to\r\nperform than to rush to its pillars and uphold them, or be crushed in\r\nthe attempt? We have tampered with a question which has grown in\r\nmagnitude by each year's delay. It requires to be plainly met--the truth\r\nto be told. The patriotism and the sound sense of the people, whenever\r\nthe Federal Government from its high places of authority shall proclaim\r\nthe truth in unequivocal language, will, in my firm belief, receive and\r\napprove it. But so long as we deal, like the Delphic oracle, in words of\r\ndouble meaning, so long as we attempt to escape from responsibility, and\r\nexhibit our fear to declare the truth by the fact that we do not act\r\nupon it, we must expect speculative theory to occupy the mind of the\r\npublic, and error to increase as time rolls on. But, if the sad fate\r\nshould be ours, for this most minute cause, to destroy our Government,\r\nthe historian who shall attempt philosophically to examine the question\r\nwill, after he has put on his microscopic glasses and discovered it, be\r\ncompelled to cry out, \"Veritably so the unseen insect in the course of\r\ntime destroys the mighty oak!\" Now, I believe--may I not say I believe?\r\nif not, then I hope--there is yet time, by the full, explicit\r\ndeclaration of the truth, to disabuse the popular mind, to arouse the\r\npopular heart, to expose the danger from lurking treason and\r\nill-concealed hostility; to rally a virtuous people to their country's\r\nrescue, who, circling closer and deeper as the storm gathers fury,\r\naround the ark of their fathers' covenant, will place it in security,\r\nthere happily to remain a sign of fraternity, justice, and equality, to\r\nour remotest posterity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: Elliott's \"Debates,\" vol. v, p. 133.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: Ibid., p. 457.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 201: Elliot's \"Debates,\" vol. v, p. 457.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203: Ibid, p. 459.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 204: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 205: Ibid., p. 460.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 206: Permoli _vs_.

We came here the representatives of an authority which\r\ncould, at any time within the past sixty days, have taken possession of\r\nthe forts in Charleston Harbor, but which, upon pledges given in a\r\nmanner that, we can not doubt, determined to trust to your honor rather\r\nthan to its own power. Since our arrival here an officer of the United\r\nStates, acting, as we are assured, not only without but against your\r\norders, has dismantled one fort and occupied another, thus altering, to\r\na most important extent, the condition of affairs under which we came.\r\n\r\nUntil these circumstances are explained in a manner which relieves us of\r\nall doubt as to the spirit in which these negotiations shall be\r\nconducted, we are forced to suspend all discussion as to any\r\narrangements by which our mutual interests might be amicably adjusted.\r\n\r\nAnd, in conclusion, we would urge upon you the immediate withdrawal of\r\nthe troops from the harbor of Charleston. Under present circumstances,\r\nthey are a standing menace which renders negotiation impossible, and, as\r\nour recent experience shows, threatens speedily to bring to a bloody\r\nissue questions which ought to be settled with temperance and judgment.\r\n\r\nWe have the honor, sir, to be, very respectfully, your obedient\r\nservants,\r\n\r\nR. W. BARNWELL,}\r\nJ. H. ADAMS,   } _Commissioners_.\r\nJAMES L. ORR,  }\r\n\r\nTo the President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reply of the President to the Commissioners_.\r\n\r\nWashington City, _December_ 30, 1860.\r\n\r\nGentlemen: I have the honor to receive your communication of 28th inst.,\r\ntogether with a copy of your \"full powers from the Convention of the\r\nPeople of South Carolina,\" authorizing you to treat with the Government\r\nof the United States on various important subjects therein mentioned,\r\nand also a copy of the ordinance bearing date on the 20th inst.,\r\ndeclaring that \"the union now subsisting between South Carolina and\r\nother States, under the name of 'The United States of America,' is\r\nhereby dissolved.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to this communication, I have to say that my position as\r\nPresident of the United States was clearly defined in the message to\r\nCongress of the 3d instant. In that I stated that, \"apart from the\r\nexecution of the laws, so far as this may be practicable, the Executive\r\nhas no authority to decide what shall be the relations between the\r\nFederal Government and South Carolina. He has been invested with no such\r\ndiscretion. He possesses no power to change the relations heretofore\r\nexisting between them, much less to acknowledge the independence of that\r\nState. This would be to invest a mere executive officer with the power\r\nof recognizing the dissolution of the confederacy among our thirty-three\r\nsovereign States. It bears no resemblance to the recognition of a\r\nforeign _de facto_ government--involving no such responsibility. Any\r\nattempt to do this would, on his part, be a naked act of usurpation. It\r\nis, therefore, my duty to submit to Congress the whole question, in all\r\nits bearings.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is my opinion still. I could, therefore, meet you only as private\r\ngentlemen of the highest character, and was entirely willing to\r\ncommunicate to Congress any proposition you might have to make to that\r\nbody upon the subject. Of this you were well aware. It was my earnest\r\ndesire that such a disposition might be made of the whole subject by\r\nCongress, who alone possess the power, as to prevent the inauguration of\r\na civil war between the parties in regard to the possession of the\r\nFederal forts in the harbor of Charleston; and I therefore deeply regret\r\nthat, in your opinion, \"the events of the last twenty-four hours render\r\nthis impossible.\" In conclusion, you urge upon me \"the immediate\r\nwithdrawal of the troops from the harbor of Charleston,\" stating that,\r\n\"under present circumstances, they are a standing menace, which renders\r\nnegotiation impossible, and, as our present experience shows, threatens\r\nspeedily to bring to a bloody issue questions which ought to be settled\r\nwith temperance and judgment.\"\r\n\r\nThe reason for this change in your position is that, since your arrival\r\nin Washington, \"an officer of the United States, acting as we (you) are\r\nassured, not only without your (my) orders, has dismantled one fort and\r\noccupied another, thus altering, to a most important extent, the\r\ncondition of affairs under which we (you) came.\" You also allege that\r\nyou came here \"the representatives of an authority which could at any\r\ntime within the past sixty days have taken possession of the forts in\r\nCharleston Harbor, but which, upon pledges given in a manner that we\r\n(you) can not doubt, determined to trust to your (my) honor rather than\r\nto its own power.\"\r\n\r\nThis brings me to a consideration of the nature of those alleged\r\npledges, and in what manner they have been observed. In my message of\r\nthe 3d of December last, I stated, in regard to the property of the\r\nUnited States in South Carolina, that it \"has been purchased for a fair\r\nequivalent 'by the consent of the Legislature of the State, for the\r\nerection of forts, magazines, arsenals,' etc., and over these the\r\nauthority 'to exercise exclusive legislation' has been expressly granted\r\nby the Constitution to Congress. It is not believed that any attempt\r\nwill be made to expel the United States from this property by force;\r\nbut, if in this I should prove to be mistaken, the officer in command of\r\nthe forts has received orders to act strictly on the defensive. In such\r\na contingency, the responsibility for consequences would rightfully rest\r\nupon the heads of the assailants.\" This being the condition of the\r\nparties on Saturday, 8th December, four of the representatives from\r\nSouth Carolina called upon me and requested an interview. We had an\r\nearnest conversation on the subject of these forts, and the best means\r\nof preventing a collision between the parties, for the purpose of\r\nsparing the effusion of blood. I suggested, for prudential reasons, that\r\nit would be best to put in writing what they said to me verbally. They\r\ndid so accordingly, and on Monday morning, the 10th instant, three of\r\nthem presented to me a paper signed by all the representatives from\r\nSouth Carolina, with a single exception, of which the following is a\r\ncopy:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To his Excellency James Buchanan, _President of the United States_:\r\n\r\n\"In compliance with our statement to you yesterday, we now express to\r\nyou our strong convictions that neither the constituted authorities, nor\r\nany body of the people of the State of South Carolina, will either\r\nattack or molest the United States forts in the harbor of Charleston,\r\npreviously to the action of the Convention, and, we hope and believe,\r\nnot until an offer has been made, through an accredited representative,\r\nto negotiate for an amicable arrangement of all matters between the\r\nState and the Federal Government, provided that no reënforcements shall\r\nbe sent into those forts, and their relative military _status_ shall\r\nremain as at present.\r\n\r\n\"John McQueen,\r\n\"William Porcher Miles,\r\n\"M. L. Bonham,\r\n\"W. W. Boyce,\r\n\"Lawrence M. Keitt.\r\n\r\n\"Washington, _December 9, 1860_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here I must, in justice to myself, remark that, at the time the\r\npaper was presented to me, I objected to the word \"provided,\" as it\r\nmight be construed into an agreement, on my part, which I never would\r\nmake. They said that nothing was further from their intention; they did\r\nnot so understand it, and I should not so consider it. It is evident\r\nthey could enter into no reciprocal agreement with me on the subject.\r\nThey did not profess to have authority to do this, and were acting in\r\ntheir individual character. I considered it as nothing more, in effect,\r\nthan the promise of highly honorable gentlemen to exert their influence\r\nfor the purpose expressed. The event has proved that they have\r\nfaithfully kept this promise, although I have never since received a\r\nline from any one of them, or from any member of the Convention on the\r\nsubject. It is well known that it was my determination, and this I\r\nfreely expressed, not to reënforce the forts in the harbor, and thus\r\nproduce a collision, until they had been actually attacked, or until I\r\nhad certain evidence that they were about to be attacked. This paper I\r\nreceived most cordially, and considered it as a happy omen that peace\r\nmight still be preserved, and that time might thus be gained for\r\nreflection. This is the whole foundation for the alleged pledge.\r\n\r\nBut I acted in the same manner I would have done had I entered into a\r\npositive and formal agreement with parties capable of contracting,\r\nalthough such an agreement would have been, on my part, from the nature\r\nof my official duties, impossible.\r\n\r\nThe world knows that I have never sent any reënforcements to the forts\r\nin Charleston Harbor, and I have certainly never authorized any change\r\nto be made \"in their relative military _status_.\"\r\n\r\nBearing upon this subject, I refer you to an order issued by the\r\nSecretary of War, on the 11th instant, to Major Anderson, but not\r\nbrought to my notice until the 21st instant. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Memorandum of verbal instructions to Major_ Anderson, _First\r\nArtillery, commanding Fort Moultrie, South Carolina_:\r\n\r\n\"You are aware of the great anxiety of the Secretary of War that a\r\ncollision of the troops with the people of this State shall be avoided,\r\nand of his studied determination to pursue a course, with reference to\r\nthe military force and forts in this harbor, which shall guard against\r\nsuch a collision. He has, therefore, carefully abstained from increasing\r\nthe force at this point, or taking any measures which might add to the\r\npresent excited state of the public mind, or which would throw any doubt\r\non the confidence he feels that South Carolina will not attempt by\r\nviolence to obtain possession of the public works, or to interfere with\r\ntheir occupancy. But, as the counsel of rash and impulsive persons may\r\npossibly disappoint these expectations of the Government, he deems it\r\nproper that you should be prepared with instructions to meet so unhappy\r\na contingency. He has, therefore, directed me, verbally, to give you\r\nsuch instructions.\r\n\r\n\"You are carefully to avoid every act which would needlessly tend to\r\nprovoke aggression; and, for that reason, you are not, without evident\r\nand imminent necessity, to take up any position which could be construed\r\ninto the assumption of a hostile attitude; but you are to hold\r\npossession of the forts in this harbor, and, if attacked, you are to\r\ndefend yourself to the last extremity. The smallness of your force will\r\nnot permit you, perhaps, to occupy more than one of the three forts; but\r\nan attack on or attempt to take possession of either of them will be\r\nregarded as an act of hostility, and you may then put your command into\r\neither of them which you may deem most proper, to increase its power of\r\nresistance. You are also authorized to take similar defensive steps\r\nwhenever you have tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile\r\nact.\r\n\r\n\"D. P. Butler, _Assistant Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\"Fort Moultrie, South Carolina, _December 11, 1860_.\r\n\r\n\"This is in conformity to my instructions to Major Buel.\r\n\r\n\"John B. Floyd, _Secretary of War_.\"\r\n\r\nThese were the last instructions transmitted to Major Anderson before\r\nhis removal to Fort Sumter, with a single exception in regard to a\r\nparticular which does not, in any degree, affect the present question.\r\nUnder these circumstances it is clear that Major Anderson acted upon his\r\nown responsibility, and without authority, unless, indeed, he had\r\n\"tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act\" on the part\r\nof the authorities of South Carolina, which has not yet been alleged.\r\nStill he is a brave and honorable officer, and justice requires that he\r\nshould not be condemned without a fair hearing.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, when I learned that Major Anderson had left Fort\r\nMoultrie, and proceeded to Fort Sumter, my first promptings were to\r\ncommand him to return to his former position, and there to await the\r\ncontingencies presented in his instructions. This could only have been\r\ndone, with any degree of safety to the command, by the concurrence of\r\nthe South Carolina authorities. But, before any steps could possibly\r\nhave been taken in this direction, we received information, dated on the\r\n28th instant, that \"the Palmetto flag floated out to the breeze at\r\nCastle Pinckney, and a large military force went over last night (the\r\n27th) to Fort Moultrie.\" Thus the authorities of South Carolina, without\r\nwaiting or asking for any explanation, and doubtless believing, as you\r\nhave expressed it, that the officer had acted not only without, but\r\nagainst my orders, on the very next day after the night when the removal\r\nwas made, seized, by a military force, two of the three Federal forts in\r\nthe harbor of Charleston, and have covered them under their own flag,\r\ninstead of that of the United States. At this gloomy period of our\r\nhistory, startling events succeed each other rapidly. On the very day\r\n(the 27th instant) that possession of these two forts was taken, the\r\nPalmetto flag was raised over the Federal Custom-House and Post-Office\r\nin Charleston; and on the same day every officer of the\r\ncustoms--collector, naval officers, surveyor, and appraisers--resigned\r\ntheir offices. And this, although it was well known, from the language\r\nof my message, that as an executive officer I felt myself bound to\r\ncollect the revenue at the port of Charleston under the existing laws.\r\nIn the harbor of Charleston we now find three forts confronting each\r\nother, over all of which the Federal flag floated only four days ago;\r\nbut now over two of them this flag has been supplanted, and the Palmetto\r\nflag has been substituted in its stead. It is under all these\r\ncircumstances that I am urged immediately to withdraw the troops from\r\nthe harbor of Charleston, and am informed that, without this,\r\nnegotiation is impossible. This I can not do; this I will not do. Such\r\nan idea was never thought of by me in any possible contingency. No\r\nallusion to it had ever been made in any communication between myself\r\nand any human being. But the inference is, that I am bound to withdraw\r\nthe troops from the only fort remaining in the possession of the United\r\nStates in the harbor of Charleston, because the officer then in command\r\nof all the forts thought proper, without instructions, to change his\r\nposition from one of them to another. I can not admit the justice of any\r\nsuch inference.\r\n\r\nAt this point of writing I have received information, by telegram, from\r\nCaptain Humphreys, in command of the arsenal at Charleston, that \"it has\r\nto-day (Sunday, the 30th) been taken by force of arms.\" It is estimated\r\nthat the munitions of war belonging to the United States in this arsenal\r\nare worth half a million of dollars.\r\n\r\nComment is needless. After this information, I have only to add that,\r\nwhile it is my duty to defend Fort Sumter, as a portion of the public\r\nproperty of the United States, against hostile attacks from whatever\r\nquarter they may come, by such means as I may possess for this purpose,\r\nI do not perceive how such a defense can be construed into a menace\r\nagainst the city of Charleston.\r\n\r\nWith great personal regard, I remain\r\n\r\nYours, very respectfully,\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\nTo Honorable Robert W. Barnwell, James H. Adams, James L. Orr.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reply of the Commissioners to the President_.\r\n\r\nWashington, D.C., _January_ 1, 1861.\r\n\r\nSir: We have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the\r\n30th December, in reply to a note addressed by us to you on the 28th of\r\nthe same month, as commissioners from South Carolina.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the declaration with which your reply commences, that\r\n\"your position as President of the United States was clearly defined in\r\nthe message to Congress of the 3d instant,\" that you possess \"no power\r\nto change the relations heretofore existing between South Carolina and\r\nthe United States, much less to acknowledge the independence of that\r\nState\"; and that, consequently, you could meet us only as private\r\ngentlemen of the highest character, with an entire willingness to\r\ncommunicate to Congress any proposition we might have to make, we deem\r\nit only necessary to say that, the State of South Carolina having, in\r\nthe exercise of that great right of self-government which underlies all\r\nour political organizations, declared herself sovereign and independent,\r\nwe, as her representatives, felt no special solicitude as to the\r\ncharacter in which you might recognize us. Satisfied that the State had\r\nsimply exercised her unquestionable right, we were prepared, in order to\r\nreach substantial good, to waive the formal considerations which your\r\nconstitutional scruples might have prevented you from extending. We came\r\nhere, therefore, expecting to be received as you did receive us, and\r\nperfectly content with that entire willingness of which you assured us,\r\nto submit any proposition to Congress which we might have to make upon\r\nthe subject of the independence of the State. That willingness was ample\r\nrecognition of the condition of public affairs which rendered our\r\npresence necessary. In this position, however, it is our duty, both to\r\nthe State which we represent and to ourselves, to correct several\r\nimportant misconceptions of our letter into which you have fallen.\r\n\r\nYou say, \"It was my earnest desire that such a disposition might be made\r\nof the whole subject by Congress, who alone possesses the power to\r\nprevent the inauguration of a civil war between the parties in regard to\r\nthe possession of the Federal forts in the harbor of Charleston; and I,\r\ntherefore, deeply regret that, in your opinion, 'the events of the last\r\ntwenty-four hours render this impossible.'\" We expressed no such\r\nopinion, and the language which you quote as ours is altered in its\r\nsense by the omission of a most important part of the sentence. What we\r\ndid say was, \"But the events of the last twenty-four hours render _such\r\nan assurance_ impossible.\" Place that \"assurance,\" as contained in our\r\nletter, in the sentence, and we are prepared to repeat it.\r\n\r\nAgain, professing to quote our language, you say: \"Thus the authorities\r\nof South Carolina, without waiting or asking for any explanation, and\r\ndoubtless believing, as you have expressed it, that the officer had\r\nacted not only without, but against my orders,\" etc. We expressed no\r\nsuch opinion in reference to the belief of the people of South Carolina.\r\nThe language which you have quoted was applied solely and entirely to\r\n_our assurance_, obtained here, and based, as you well know, upon your\r\nown declaration--a declaration which, at that time, it was impossible\r\nfor the authorities of South Carolina to have known. But, without\r\nfollowing this letter into all its details, we propose only to meet the\r\nchief points of the argument.\r\n\r\nSome weeks ago, the State of South Carolina declared her intention, in\r\nthe existing condition of public affairs, to secede from the United\r\nStates. She called a convention of her people to put her declaration in\r\nforce. The Convention met and passed the ordinance of secession. All\r\nthis you anticipated, and your course of action was thoroughly\r\nconsidered. In your annual message you declared that you had no right,\r\nand would not attempt, to coerce a seceding State, but that you were\r\nbound by your constitutional oath, and would defend the property of the\r\nUnited States within the borders of South Carolina, if an attempt was\r\nmade to take it by force. Seeing very early that this question of\r\nproperty was a difficult and delicate one, you manifested a desire to\r\nsettle it without collision. You did not reënforce the garrisons in the\r\nharbor of Charleston. You removed a distinguished and veteran officer\r\nfrom the command of Fort Moultrie, because he attempted to increase his\r\nsupply of ammunition. You refused to send additional troops to the same\r\ngarrison when applied for by the officer appointed to succeed him. You\r\naccepted the resignation of the oldest and most eminent member of your\r\nCabinet, rather than allow these garrisons to be strengthened. You\r\ncompelled an officer stationed at Fort Sumter to return immediately to\r\nthe arsenal forty muskets which he had taken to arm his men. You\r\nexpressed, not to one, but to many, of the most distinguished of our\r\npublic characters, whose testimony will be placed upon the record\r\nwhenever it is necessary, your anxiety for a peaceful termination of\r\nthis controversy, and your willingness not to disturb the military\r\n_status_ of the forts, if commissioners should be sent to the\r\nGovernment, whose communications you promised to submit to Congress. You\r\nreceived and acted on assurances from the highest official authorities\r\nof South Carolina, that no attempt would be made to disturb your\r\npossession of the forts and property of the United States, if you would\r\nnot disturb their existing condition until commissioners had been sent,\r\nand the attempt to negotiate had failed. You took from the members of\r\nthe House of Representatives a written memorandum that no such attempt\r\nshould be made, \"provided that no reënforcements shall be sent into\r\nthose forts, and their relative military _status_ shall remain as at\r\npresent.\" And, although you attach no force to the acceptance of such a\r\npaper, although you \"considered it as nothing more in effect than the\r\npromise of highly honorable gentlemen,\" as an obligation on one side\r\nwithout corresponding obligation on the other, it must be remembered (if\r\nwe are rightly informed) that you were pledged, if you ever did send\r\nreënforcements, to return it to those from whom you had received it\r\nbefore you executed your resolution. You sent orders to your officers,\r\ncommanding them strictly to follow a line of conduct in conformity with\r\nsuch an understanding.\r\n\r\nBesides all this, you had received formal and official notice, from the\r\nGovernor of South Carolina, that we had been appointed commissioners and\r\nwere on our way to Washington. You knew the implied condition under\r\nwhich we came; our arrival was notified to you, and an hour appointed\r\nfor an interview. We arrived in Washington on Wednesday, at three\r\no'clock, and you appointed an interview with us at one the next day.\r\nEarly on that day, Thursday, the news was received here of the movement\r\nof Major Anderson. That news was communicated to you immediately, and\r\nyou postponed our meeting until half-past two o'clock on Friday, in\r\norder that you might consult your Cabinet. On Friday we saw you, and we\r\ncalled upon you then to redeem your pledge. You could not deny it. With\r\nthe facts we have stated, and in the face of the crowning and conclusive\r\nfact that your Secretary of War had resigned his seat in the Cabinet,\r\nupon the publicly avowed ground that the action of Major Anderson had\r\nviolated the pledged faith of the Government, and that unless the pledge\r\nwas instantly redeemed he was dishonored, denial was impossible; you did\r\nnot deny it. You do not deny it now, but you seek to escape from its\r\nobligations on two grounds: 1. That _we_ terminated all negotiation by\r\ndemanding, as a preliminary, the withdrawal of the United States troops\r\nfrom the harbor of Charleston; and, 2. That the authorities of South\r\nCarolina, instead of asking explanation and giving you the opportunity\r\nto vindicate yourself, took possession of other property of the United\r\nStates. We will examine both.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we deny positively that we have ever, in any way,\r\nmade any such demand. Our letter is in your possession; it will stand by\r\nthis on the record. In it we inform you of the objects of our mission.\r\nWe say that it would have been our duty to assure you of our readiness\r\nto commence negotiations with the most earnest and anxious desire to\r\nsettle all questions between us amicably, and to our mutual advantage,\r\nbut that events had rendered that assurance impossible. We stated the\r\nevents, and we said that, until some satisfactory explanation of these\r\nevents was given us, we could not proceed; and then, having made this\r\nrequest for explanation, we added: \"And, in conclusion, we would urge\r\nupon you the immediate withdrawal of the troops from the harbor of\r\nCharleston. Under present circumstances they are a standing menace,\r\nwhich renders negotiation impossible,\" etc. \"Under present\r\ncircumstances!\" What circumstances? Why, clearly the occupation of Fort\r\nSumter, and the dismantling of Fort Moultrie by Major Anderson, in the\r\nface of your pledges, and without explanation or practical disavowal.\r\nAnd there is nothing in the letter which would or could have prevented\r\nyou from declining to withdraw the troops, and offering the restoration\r\nof the _status_ to which you were pledged, if such had been your desire.\r\nIt would have been wiser and better, in our opinion, to have withdrawn\r\nthe troops, and this opinion we urged upon you, but we _demanded_\r\nnothing but such an explanation of the events of the last twenty-four\r\nhours as would restore our confidence in the spirit with which the\r\nnegotiation should be conducted. In relation to this withdrawal of the\r\ntroops from the harbor, we are compelled, however, to notice one passage\r\nof your letter. Referring to it, you say: \"This I can not do; this I\r\nwill not do. Such an idea was never thought of by me in any possible\r\ncontingency. No allusion to it had ever been made in any communication\r\nbetween myself and any human being.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to this statement, we are compelled to say that your\r\nconversation with us left upon our minds the distinct impression that\r\nyou did seriously contemplate the withdrawal of the troops from\r\nCharleston Harbor. And, in support of this impression, we would add that\r\nwe have the positive assurance of gentlemen of the highest possible\r\npublic reputation and the most unsullied integrity--men whose name and\r\nfame, secured by long service and patriotic achievement, place their\r\ntestimony beyond cavil--that such suggestions had been made to and urged\r\nupon you by them, and had formed the subject of more than one earnest\r\ndiscussion with you. And it was this knowledge that induced us to urge\r\nupon you a policy which had to recommend it its own wisdom and the\r\nweight of such authority. As to the second point, that the authorities\r\nof South Carolina, instead of asking explanations, and giving you the\r\nopportunity to vindicate yourself, took possession of other property of\r\nthe United States, we would observe, first, that, even if this were so,\r\nit does not avail you for defense, for the opportunity for decision was\r\nafforded you before these facts occurred. We arrived in Washington on\r\nWednesday. The news from Major Anderson reached here early on Thursday,\r\nand was immediately communicated to you. All that day, men of the\r\nhighest consideration--men who had striven successfully to lift you to\r\nyour great office--who had been your tried and true friends through the\r\ntroubles of your Administration--sought you and entreated you to act--to\r\nact at once. They told you that every hour complicated your position.\r\nThey only asked you to give the assurance that, if the facts were so--if\r\nthe commander had acted without and against your orders, and in\r\nviolation of your pledges--you would restore the _status_ you had\r\npledged your honor to maintain.\r\n\r\nYou refused to decide. Your Secretary of War--your immediate and proper\r\nadviser in this whole matter--waited anxiously for your decision, until\r\nhe felt that delay was becoming dishonor. More than twelve hours passed,\r\nand two Cabinet meetings had adjourned before you knew what the\r\nauthorities of South Carolina had done, and your prompt decision at any\r\nmoment of that time would have avoided the subsequent complications.\r\nBut, if you had known the acts of the authorities of South Carolina,\r\nshould that have prevented your keeping your faith? What was the\r\ncondition of things? For the last sixty days, you have had in Charleston\r\nHarbor not force enough to hold the forts against an equal enemy. Two of\r\nthem were empty; one of those two, the most important in the harbor. It\r\ncould have been taken at any time. You ought to know, better than any\r\nman, that it would have been taken, but for the efforts of those who put\r\ntheir trust in your honor. Believing that they were threatened by Fort\r\nSumter especially, the people were, with difficulty, restrained from\r\nsecuring, without blood, the possession of this important fortress.\r\nAfter many and reiterated assurances given on your behalf, which we can\r\nnot believe unauthorized, they determined to forbear, and in good faith\r\nsent on their commissioners to negotiate with you. They meant you no\r\nharm, wished you no ill. They thought of you kindly, believed you true,\r\nand were willing, as far as was consistent with duty, to spare you\r\nunnecessary and hostile collision. Scarcely had their commissioners\r\nleft, than Major Anderson waged war. No other words will describe his\r\naction. It was not a peaceful change from one fort to another; it was a\r\nhostile act in the highest sense--one only justified in the presence of\r\na superior enemy and in imminent peril. He abandoned his position,\r\nspiked his guns, burned his gun-carriages, made preparations for the\r\ndestruction of his post, and withdrew under cover of the night to a\r\nsafer position. This was war. No man could have believed (without your\r\nassurance) that any officer could have taken such a step, \"not only\r\nwithout orders, but against orders.\" What the State did was in simple\r\nself-defense; for this act, with all its attending circumstances, was as\r\nmuch war as firing a volley; and, war being thus begun, until those\r\ncommencing it explained their action, and disavowed their intention,\r\nthere was no room for delay; and, even at this moment, while we are\r\nwriting, it is more than probable, from the tenor of your letter, that\r\nreënforcements are hurrying on to the conflict, so that, when the first\r\ngun shall be fired, there will have been, on your part, one continuous\r\nconsistent series of actions commencing in a demonstration essentially\r\nwarlike, supported by regular reënforcement, and terminating in defeat\r\nor victory. And all this without the slightest provocation; for, among\r\nthe many things which you have said, there is one thing you can not\r\nsay--you have waited anxiously for news from the seat of war, in hopes\r\nthat delay would furnish some excuse for this precipitation. But this\r\n\"tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act, on the part\r\nof the authorities of South Carolina\" (which is the only justification\r\nof Major Anderson), you are forced to admit \"has not _yet_ been\r\nalleged.\" But you have decided. You have resolved to hold by force what\r\nyou have obtained through our misplaced confidence, and, by refusing to\r\ndisavow the action of Major Anderson, have converted his violation of\r\norders into a legitimate act of your Executive authority. Be the issue\r\nwhat it may, of this we are assured, that, if Fort Moultrie has been\r\nrecorded in history as a memorial of Carolina gallantry, Fort Sumter\r\nwill live upon the succeeding page as an imperishable testimony of\r\nCarolina faith.\r\n\r\nBy your course you have probably rendered civil war inevitable. Be it\r\nso. If you choose to force this issue upon us, the State of South\r\nCarolina will accept it, and, relying upon Him who is the God of justice\r\nas well as the God of hosts, will endeavor to perform the great duty\r\nwhich lies before her, hopefully, bravely, and thoroughly.\r\n\r\nOur mission being one for negotiation and peace, and your note leaving\r\nus without hope of a withdrawal of the troops from Fort Sumter, or of\r\nthe restoration of the _status quo_ existing at the time of our arrival,\r\nand intimating, as we think, your determination to reënforce the\r\ngarrison in the harbor of Charleston, we respectfully inform you that we\r\npropose returning to Charleston on to-morrow afternoon.\r\n\r\nWe have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servants,\r\n\r\nR. W. BARNWELL,    }\r\nJ. H. ADAMS,       } _Commissioners_.\r\nJAMES L. ORR,      }\r\n\r\nTo his Excellency the President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last communication is endorsed as follows:\r\n\r\nExecutive Mansion, 3½ _o'clock, Wednesday_.\r\n\r\nThis paper, just presented to the President, is of such a character that\r\nhe declines to receive it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX H.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeech on the state of the country, by Mr. Davis, of Mississippi, in the\r\nSenate of the United States, January 10, 1861--a motion to print the\r\nspecial message of the President of the United States, of January 9th,\r\nbeing under consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis: Mr. President, when I took the floor yesterday, I intended to\r\nengage somewhat in the argument which has heretofore prevailed in the\r\nSenate upon the great questions of constitutional right, which have\r\ndivided the country from the beginning of the Government. I intended to\r\nadduce some evidences, which I thought were conclusive, in favor of the\r\nopinions which I entertain; but events, with a current hurrying on as it\r\nprogresses, have borne me past the point where it would be useful for me\r\nto argue, by the citing of authorities, the question of rights. To-day,\r\ntherefore, it is my purpose to deal with events. Abstract argument has\r\nbecome among the things that are past. We have to deal now with facts;\r\nand, in order that we may meet those facts and apply them to our present\r\ncondition, it is well to inquire what is the state of the country. The\r\nConstitution provides that the President shall, from time to time,\r\ncommunicate information on the state of the Union. The message which is\r\nnow under consideration gives us very little, indeed, beyond that which\r\nthe world--less, indeed, than reading men generally--knew before it was\r\ncommunicated.\r\n\r\nWhat, Senators, to-day is the condition of the country? From every\r\ncorner of it comes the wailing cry of patriotism, pleading for the\r\npreservation of the great inheritance we derived from our fathers. Is\r\nthere a Senator who does not daily receive letters appealing to him to\r\nuse even the small power which one man here possesses to save the rich\r\ninheritance our fathers gave us? Tears are trickling down the stern\r\nfaces of men who have bled for the flag of their country, and are\r\nwilling now to die for it; but patriotism stands powerless before the\r\nplea that the party about to come into power laid down a platform, and\r\nthat come what will, though ruin stare us in the face, consistency must\r\nbe adhered to, even though the Government be lost.\r\n\r\nIn this state of the case, then, we turn and ask, What is the character\r\nof the Administration? What is the Executive department doing? What\r\nassurance have we there for the safety of the country? But we come back\r\nfrom that inquiry with a mournful conviction that feeble hands now hold\r\nthe reins of state; that drivelers are taken in as counselors, not\r\nprovided by the Constitution; that vacillation is the law; and the\r\npolicy of this great Government is changed with every changing rumor of\r\nthe day; nay, more, it is changing with every new phase of causeless\r\nfear. In this state of the case, after complications have been\r\nintroduced into the question, after we were brought to the verge of war,\r\nafter we were hourly expecting by telegraph to learn that the conflict\r\nhad commenced, after nothing had been done to insure the peace of the\r\nland, we are told in this last hour that the question is thrown at the\r\ndoor of Congress, and here rests the responsibility.\r\n\r\nHad the garrison at Charleston, representing the claim of the Government\r\nto hold the property in a fort there, been called away thirty days, nay,\r\nten days ago, peace would have spread its pinions over this land, and\r\ncalm negotiation would have been the order of the day. Why was it not\r\nrecalled? No reason yet has been offered, save that the Government is\r\nbound to preserve its property; and yet look from North to South, from\r\nEast to West, wherever we have constructed forts to defend States\r\nagainst a foreign foe, and everywhere you find them without a garrison,\r\nexcept at a few points where troops are kept for special purposes; not\r\nto coerce or to threaten a State, but stationed in seacoast\r\nfortifications, there merely for the purposes of discipline and\r\ninstruction as artillerists. You find all the other forts in the hands\r\nof fort-keepers and ordnance-sergeants, and, before a moral and\r\npatriotic people, standing safely there as the property of the country.\r\n\r\nI asked in this Senate, weeks ago: \"What causes the peril that is now\r\nimminent at Fort Moultrie; is it the weakness of the garrison?\" and then\r\nI answered, \"No, it is its presence, not its weakness.\" Had an\r\nordnance-sergeant there represented the Federal Government, had there\r\nbeen no troops, no physical power to protect it, I would have pledged my\r\nlife upon the issue that no question ever would have been made as to its\r\nseizure. Now, not only there, but elsewhere, we find movements of troops\r\nfurther to complicate this question, and probably to precipitate us upon\r\nthe issue of civil war; and, worse than all, this Government, reposing\r\non the consent of the governed; this Government, strong in the\r\naffections of the people; this Government (I describe it as our fathers\r\nmade it) is now furtively sending troops to occupy positions lest \"the\r\nmob\" should seize them. When before in the history of our land was it\r\nthat a mob could resist the sound public opinion of the country? When\r\nbefore was it that an unarmed magistrate had not the power, by crying,\r\n\"I command the peace,\" to quell a mob in any portion of the land? Yet\r\nnow we find, under cover of night, troops detached from one position to\r\noccupy another. Fort Washington, standing in its lonely grandeur, and\r\noverlooking the home of the Father of his Country, near by the place\r\nwhere the ashes of Washington repose, built there to prevent a foreign\r\nfoe from coming up the Potomac with armed ships to take the\r\ncapital--Fort Washington is garrisoned by marines sent secretly away\r\nfrom the navy yard at Washington. And Fort McHenry, memorable in our\r\nhistory as the place where, under bombardment, the star-spangled banner\r\nfloated through the darkness of night, the point which was consecrated\r\nby our national song--Fort McHenry, too, has been garrisoned by a\r\ndetachment of marines, sent from this place in an extra train, and sent\r\nunder cover of the night, so that even the mob should not know it.\r\n\r\nSenators, the responsibility is thrown at the door of Congress. Let us\r\ntake it. It is our duty in this last hour to seize the pillars of our\r\nGovernment and uphold them, though we be crushed in the fall. Then what\r\nis our policy? Are we to drift into war? Are we to stand idly by, and\r\nallow war to be precipitated upon the country? Allow an officer of the\r\narmy to make war? Allow an unconfirmed head of a department to make war?\r\nAllow a general of the army to make war? Allow a President to make war?\r\nNo, sir. Our fathers gave to Congress the power to declare war, and even\r\nto Congress they gave no power to make war upon a State of the Union. It\r\ncould not have been given, except as a power to dissolve the Union.\r\nWhen, then, we see, as is evident to the whole country, that we are\r\ndrifting into a war between the United States and an individual State,\r\ndoes it become the Senate to sit listlessly by and discuss abstract\r\nquestions, and read patchwork from the opinions of men now mingled with\r\nthe dust? Are we not bound to meet events as they come before us,\r\nmanfully and patriotically to struggle with the difficulties which now\r\noppress the country?\r\n\r\nIn the message yesterday, we were even told that the District of\r\nColumbia was in danger. In danger of what? From whom comes the danger?\r\nIs there a man here who dreads that the deliberations of this body are\r\nto be interrupted by an armed force? Is there one who would not prefer\r\nto fall with dignity at his station, the representative of a great and\r\npeaceful Government, rather than to be protected by armed bands? And yet\r\nthe rumor is--and rumors seem now to be so authentic that we credit them\r\nrather than other means of information--that companies of artillery are\r\nto be quartered in this city to preserve peace, where the laws have\r\nheretofore been supreme, and that this District is to become a camp by\r\ncalling out every able-bodied man within its limits to bear arms under\r\nthe militia law. Are we invaded? Is there an insurrection? Are there two\r\nSenators here who would not be willing to go forth as a file, and put\r\ndown any resistance which showed itself in this District against the\r\nGovernment of the United States? Is the reproach meant against these, my\r\nfriends from the South, who advocate Southern rights and State rights?\r\nIf so, it is a base slander. We claim our rights under the Constitution;\r\nwe claim our rights reserved to the States; and we seek by no brute\r\nforce to gain any advantage which the law and the Constitution do not\r\ngive us. We have never appealed to mobs. We have never asked for the\r\narmy and the navy to protect us. On the soil of Mississippi, not the\r\nfoot of a Federal soldier has been impressed since 1819, when, flying\r\nfrom the yellow fever, they sought refuge within the limits of our\r\nState; and on the soil of Mississippi there breathes not a man who asks\r\nfor any other protection than that which our Constitution gives us, that\r\nwhich our strong arms afford, and the brave hearts of our people will\r\ninsure in every contingency.\r\n\r\nSenators, we are rapidly drifting into a position in which this is to\r\nbecome a government of the army and navy; in which the authority of the\r\nUnited States is to be maintained, not by law, not by constitutional\r\nagreement between the States, but by physical force; and will you stand\r\nstill and see this policy consummated? Will you fold your arms, the\r\ndegenerate descendants of those men who proclaimed the eternal principle\r\nthat government rests on the consent of the governed; and that every\r\npeople have a right to change, modify, or abolish a government when it\r\nceases to answer the ends for which it was established, and permit this\r\nGovernment imperceptibly to slide from the moorings where it was\r\noriginally anchored, and become a military despotism? It was well said\r\nby the Senator from New York [Mr. Seward], whom I do not now see in his\r\nseat--well said in a speech wherein I found but little to commend--that\r\nthis Union could not be maintained by force, and that a Union of force\r\nwas a despotism. It was a great truth, come from what quarter it may.\r\nThat was not the Government instituted by our fathers; and against it,\r\nso long as I live, with heart and hand, I will rebel.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to a passage in the message which says:\r\n\r\n\"I certainly had no right to make aggressive war upon any State; and I\r\nam perfectly satisfied that the Constitution has wisely withheld that\r\npower even from Congress\"--very good--\"but the right and the duty to use\r\nmilitary force defensively against those who resist the Federal officers\r\nin the exercise of their legal functions, and against those who assail\r\nthe power of the Federal Government, are clear and undeniable.\"\r\n\r\nIs it so? Where does he get it? Our fathers were so jealous of a\r\nstanding army, that they scarcely would permit the organization and\r\nmaintenance of any army! Where does he get the \"clear and undeniable\"\r\npower to use the force of the United States in the manner he there\r\nproposes? To execute a process, troops may be summoned in a posse\r\ncomitatus; and here, in the history of our Government, it is not to be\r\nforgotten that in the earlier and, as it is frequently said, the better\r\ndays of the republic--and painfully we feel that they were better\r\nindeed--a President of the United States did not recur to the army; he\r\nwent to the people of the United States. Vaguely and confusedly, indeed,\r\ndid the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Johnson] bring forward the case of\r\nthe great man, Washington, as one in which he had used a means which, he\r\nargued, was equivalent to the coercion of a State; for he said that\r\nWashington used the military power against a portion of a people of the\r\nState; and why might he not as well have used it against the whole\r\nState? Let me tell that Senator that the case of General Washington has\r\nno such application as he supposes. It was a case of insurrection in the\r\nState of Pennsylvania; and the very message from which he read\r\ncommunicated the fact that Governor Mifflin thought it was necessary to\r\ncall the militia of the adjoining States to aid him. President\r\nWashington coöperated with Governor Mifflin; he called the militia of\r\nadjoining States to coöperate with those of Pennsylvania. He used the\r\nmilitia, not as a standing army. It was by the consent of the Governor;\r\nit was by his advice. It was not the invasion of the State; it was not\r\nthe coercion of the State; but it was aiding the State to put down\r\ninsurrection, and in the very manner provided for in the Constitution\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nBut, I ask again, what power has the President to use the army and navy\r\nexcept to execute process? Are we to have drum-head courts substituted\r\nfor those which the Constitution and laws provide? Are we to have\r\nsergeants sent over the land instead of civil magistrates? Not so\r\nthought the elder Adams; and here, in passing, I will pay him a tribute\r\nhe deserves, as the one to whom, more than any other man among the early\r\nfounders of this Government, credit is due for the military principles\r\nwhich prevail in its organization. Associated with Mr. Jefferson\r\noriginally, in preparing the rules and articles of war, Mr. Adams\r\nreverted through the long pages of history back to the empire of Rome,\r\nand drew from that foundation the very rules and articles of war which\r\ngovern in our country to-day, and drew them thence because he said they\r\nhad brought two nations to the pinnacle of glory--referring to the\r\nRomans and the Britons, whose military law was borrowed from them. Mr.\r\nAdams, however, when an insurrection occurred in the same State of\r\nPennsylvania, not only relied upon the militia, but his orders, through\r\nSecretary McHenry, required that the militia of the vicinage should be\r\nemployed; and, though he did order troops from Philadelphia, he required\r\nthe militia of the northern counties to be employed as long as they were\r\nable to execute the laws; and the orders given to Colonel McPherson,\r\nthen in New Jersey, were, that Federal troops should not go across the\r\nJersey line except in the last resort. I say, then, when we trace our\r\nhistory to its early foundation, under the first two Presidents of the\r\nUnited States, we find that this idea of using the army and the navy to\r\nexecute the laws at the discretion of the President was one not even\r\nentertained, still less acted upon, in any case.\r\n\r\nThen, Senators, we are brought to consider passing events. A little\r\ngarrison in the harbor of Charleston now occupies a post which, I am\r\nsorry to say, it gained by the perfidious breach of an understanding\r\nbetween the parties concerned; and here, that I may do justice to one\r\nwho had not the power, on this floor at least, to right himself--who has\r\nno friend here to represent him--let me say that remark does not apply\r\nto Major Anderson; for I hold that, though his orders were not so\r\ndesigned, as I am assured, they did empower him to go from one post to\r\nanother, and to take his choice of the posts in the harbor of\r\nCharleston; but in so doing he committed an act of hostility. When he\r\ndismantled Fort Moultrie, when he burned the carriages and spiked the\r\nguns bearing upon Fort Sumter, he put Carolina in the attitude of an\r\nenemy of the United States; and yet he has not shown that there was any\r\njust cause for apprehension. Vague rumors had reached him--and causeless\r\nfear seems now to be the impelling motive of every public act--vague\r\nrumors of an intention to take Fort Moultrie. But, sir, a soldier should\r\nbe confronted by an overpowering force before he spikes his guns and\r\nburns his carriages. A soldier should be confronted by a public enemy\r\nbefore he destroys the property of the United States lest it should fall\r\ninto the hands of such an enemy. Was that fort built to make war upon\r\nCarolina? Was an armament put into it for such a purpose? Or was it\r\nbuilt for the protection of Charleston Harbor; and was it armed to make\r\nthat protection effective? If so, what right had any soldier to destroy\r\nthat armament lest it should fall into the hands of Carolina?\r\n\r\nSome time since I presented to the Senate resolutions which embodied my\r\nviews upon this subject, drawing from the Constitution itself the data\r\non which I based those resolutions. I then invoked the attention of the\r\nSenate in that form to the question as to whether garrisons should be\r\nkept within a State against the consent of that State. Clear was I then,\r\nas I am now, in my conclusion. No garrison should be kept within a\r\nState, during a time of peace, if the State believes the presence of\r\nthat garrison to be either offensive or dangerous. Our army is\r\nmaintained for common defense; our forts are built out of the common\r\nTreasury, to which every State contributes; and they are perverted from\r\nthe purpose for which they were erected whenever they are garrisoned\r\nwith a view to threaten, to intimidate, or to control a State in any\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nYet, we are told this is no purpose to coerce a State; we are told that\r\nthe power does not exist to coerce a State; but the Senator from\r\nTennessee [Mr. Johnson] says it is only a power to coerce individuals;\r\nand the Senator from Ohio [Mr. Wade] seems to look upon this latter\r\npower as a very harmless power in the hands of the President, though the\r\nresults of such coercion might be to destroy the State. What is a State?\r\nIs it land and houses? Is it taxable property? Is it the organization of\r\nthe local government? Or is it all these combined with the people who\r\npossess them? Destroy the people, and yet not make war upon the State!\r\nTo state the proposition is to answer it, by reason of its very\r\nabsurdity. It is like making desolation, and calling it peace. There\r\nbeing, as it is admitted on every hand, no power to coerce a State, I\r\nask what is the use of a garrison within a State where it needs no\r\ndefense? The answer from every candid mind must be, there is none. The\r\nanswer from every patriotic breast must be, peace requires under all\r\nsuch circumstances that the garrison should be withdrawn. Let the Senate\r\nto-day, as the responsibility is thrown at our door, pass those\r\nresolutions, or others which better express the idea contained in them,\r\nand you have taken one long step toward peace, one long stride toward\r\nthe preservation of the Government of our fathers.\r\n\r\nThe President's message of December, however, has all the\r\ncharacteristics of a diplomatic paper, for diplomacy is said to abhor\r\ncertainty as Nature abhors a vacuum; and it was not within the power of\r\nman to reach any fixed conclusion from that message. When the country\r\nwas agitated, when opinions were being formed, when we were drifting\r\nbeyond the power ever to return, this was not what we had a right to\r\nexpect from the Chief Magistrate. One policy or the other he ought to\r\nhave taken. If believing this to be a government of force, if believing\r\nit to be a consolidated mass, and not a confederation of States, he\r\nshould have said: \"No State has a right to secede; every State is\r\nsubordinate to the Federal Government, and the Federal Government must\r\nempower me with physical means to reduce to subjugation the State\r\nasserting such a right.\" If not, if a State-rights man and a\r\nDemocrat--as for many years it has been my pride to acknowledge our\r\nvenerable Chief Magistrate to be--then another line of policy should\r\nhave been taken. The Constitution gave no power to the Federal\r\nGovernment to coerce a State; the Constitution gave an army for the\r\npurposes of common defense, and to preserve domestic tranquillity; but\r\nthe Constitution never contemplated using that army against a State. A\r\nState exercising the sovereign function of secession is beyond the reach\r\nof the Federal Government, unless we woo her with the voice of\r\nfraternity, and bring her back to the enticements of affection. One\r\npolicy or the other should have been taken; and it is not for me to say\r\nwhich, though my opinion is well known; but one policy or the other\r\nshould have been pursued. He should have brought his opinion to one\r\nconclusion or another, and to-day our country would have been safer than\r\nit is.\r\n\r\nWhat is the message before us? Does it benefit the case? Is there a\r\nsolution offered here? We are informed in it of propositions made by\r\ncommissioners from South Carolina. We are not informed even as to how\r\nthey terminated. No countervailing proposition is presented; no\r\nsuggestion is made. We are left drifting loosely, without chart or\r\ncompass.\r\n\r\nThere is in our recent history, however, an event which might have\r\nsuggested a policy to be pursued. When foreigners having no citizenship\r\nwithin the United States declared war against it and made war upon it;\r\nwhen the inhabitants of a Territory, disgraced by institutions offensive\r\nto the laws of every State of the Union, held this attitude of\r\nrebellion; when the Executive there had power to use troops, he first\r\nsent commissioners of peace to win them back to their duty. When South\r\nCarolina, a sovereign State, resumes the grants she had delegated; when\r\nSouth Carolina stands in an attitude which threatens within a short\r\nperiod to involve the country in a civil war unless the policy of the\r\nGovernment be changed, no suggestion is made to us that this Government\r\nmight send commissioners to her; no suggestion is made to us that better\r\ninformation should be sought; there is no policy of peace, but we are\r\ntold the army and navy are in the hands of the President of the United\r\nStates, to be used against those who assail the power of the Federal\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThen, my friends, are we to allow events to drift onward to this fatal\r\nconsummation? Are we to do nothing to restore peace? Shall we not, in\r\naddition to the proposition I have already made, to withdraw the force\r\nwhich complicates the question, send commissioners there in order that\r\nwe may learn what this community desire, what this community will do,\r\nand put the two Governments upon friendly relations?\r\n\r\nI will not weary the Senate by going over the argument of coercion. My\r\nfriend from Ohio [Mr. Pugh], I may say, has exhausted the subject. I\r\nthank him, because it came appropriately from one not identified by his\r\nposition with South Carolina. It came more effectively from him than it\r\nwould have done from me, had I (as I have not) a power to present it as\r\nforcibly as he has done. Sirs, let me say, among the painful reflections\r\nwhich have crowded upon me by day and by night, none have weighed more\r\nheavily upon my heart than the reflection that our separation severs the\r\nties which have so long bound us to our Northern friends, of whom we are\r\nglad to recognize the Senator as a type.\r\n\r\nNow let us return a moment to consider what would have been the state of\r\nthe case if the garrison at Charleston had been withdrawn. The fort\r\nwould have stood there, not dismantled, but unoccupied. It would have\r\nstood there in the hands of an ordnance-sergeant. Commissioners would\r\nhave come to treat of all questions with the Federal Government, of\r\nthese forts as well as others. They would have remained there to answer\r\nthe ends for which they were constructed--the ends of defense. If South\r\nCarolina was an independent State, then she might hold to us such a\r\nrelation as Rhode Island held after the dissolution of the Confederation\r\nand before the formation of the Union, when Rhode Island appealed to the\r\nsympathies existing between the States connected in the struggles of the\r\nRevolution, and asked that a commercial war should not be waged upon\r\nher. These forts would have stood there then to cover the harbor of a\r\nfriendly State; and, if the feeling which once existed among the people\r\nof the States had subsisted still, and that fort had been attacked,\r\nbrave men from every section would have rushed to the rescue, and there\r\nimperiled their lives in the defense of a State identified with their\r\nearly history, and still associated in their breasts with affectionate\r\nmemories; the first act of this kind would have been one appealing to\r\nevery generous motive of those people, again to reconsider the question\r\nof how we could live together, and through that bloody ordeal to have\r\nbrought us into the position in which our fathers left us. There need\r\nhave been no collision, as there could have been no question of property\r\nwhich that State was not ready to meet. If it was a question of dollars\r\nand cents, they came here to adjust it. If it was a question of covering\r\nan interior State, their interests were identical. In whatever way the\r\nquestion could have been presented, the consequence would have been to\r\nrelieve the Government of the charge of maintaining the fort, and to\r\nthrow it upon the State which had resolved to be independent.\r\n\r\nThus we see that no evil could have resulted. We have yet to learn what\r\nevil the opposite policy may bring. Telegraphic intelligence, by the man\r\nwho occupied the seat on the right of me in the old Chamber, was never\r\nrelied on. He was the wisest statesman I ever knew--a man whose\r\nprophetic vision foretold all the trials through which we are now\r\npassing; whose clear intellect, elaborating everything, borrowing\r\nnothing from anybody, seemed to dive into the future, and to unveil\r\nthose things which are hidden to other eyes. Need I say I mean Calhoun?\r\nNo other man than he would have answered this description. I say, then,\r\nnot relying upon telegraphic dispatches, we still have information\r\nenough to notify us that we are on the verge of civil war; that civil\r\nwar is in the hands of men irresponsible, as it seems to us; their acts\r\nunknown to us; their discretion not covered by any existing law or\r\nusage; and we now have the responsibility thrown upon us, which\r\njustifies us in demanding information to meet an emergency in which the\r\ncountry is involved.\r\n\r\nIs there any point of pride which prevents us from withdrawing that\r\ngarrison? I have heard it said by a gallant gentleman, to whom I make no\r\nspecial reference, that the great objection was an unwillingness to\r\nlower the flag. To lower the flags! Under what circumstances? Does any\r\nman's courage impel him to stand boldly forth to take the life of his\r\nbrethren? Does any man insist upon going upon the open field with deadly\r\nweapons to fight his brother on a question of courage? There is no point\r\nof pride. These are your brethren; and they have shed as much glory upon\r\nthat flag as any equal number of men in the Union. They are the men, and\r\nthat is the locality, where the first Union flag was unfurled, and where\r\nwas fought a gallant battle before our independence was declared--not\r\nthe flag with thirteen stripes and thirty-three stars, but a flag with a\r\ncross of St. George, and the long stripes running through it. When the\r\ngallant Moultrie took the British Fort Johnson and carried it, for the\r\nfirst time, I believe, did the Union flag fly in the air; and that was\r\nin October, 1775. When he took the position and threw up a temporary\r\nbattery with palmetto-logs and sand, upon the site called Fort Moultrie,\r\nthat fort was assailed by the British fleet, and bombarded until the old\r\nlogs, clinging with stern tenacity, were filled with balls, but the flag\r\nstill floated there, and, though many bled, the garrison conquered.\r\nThose old logs are gone; the eroding current is even taking away the\r\nsite where Fort Moultrie stood; the gallant men who held it now mingle\r\nwith the earth; but their memories live in the hearts of a brave people,\r\nand their sons yet live, and they, like their fathers, are ready to\r\nbleed and to die for the cause in which their fathers triumphed.\r\nGlorious are the memories clinging around that old fort which now, for\r\nthe first time, has been abandoned--abandoned not even in the presence\r\nof a foe, but under the imaginings that a foe might come; and guns\r\nspiked and carriages burned where the band of Moultrie bled, and, with\r\nan insufficient armament, repelled the common foe of all the colonies.\r\nHer ancient history compares proudly with the present.\r\n\r\nCan there, then, be a point of pride upon so sacred a soil as this,\r\nwhere the blood of the fathers cries to heaven against civil war? Can\r\nthere be a point of pride against laying upon that sacred soil to-day\r\nthe flag for which our fathers died? My pride, Senators, is different.\r\nMy pride is that that flag shall not set between contending brothers;\r\nand that, when it shall no longer be the common flag of the country, it\r\nshall be folded up and laid away like a vesture no longer used; that it\r\nshall be kept as a sacred memento of the past, to which each of us can\r\nmake a pilgrimage and remember the glorious days in which we were born.\r\n\r\nIn the answer of the commissioners which I caused to be read yesterday,\r\nI observed that they referred to Fort Sumter as remaining a memento of\r\nCarolina faith. It is an instance of the accuracy of the opinion which I\r\nhave expressed. It stood without a garrison. It commanded the harbor,\r\nand the fort was known to have the armament in it capable of defense.\r\nDid the Carolinians attack it? Did they propose to seize it? It stood\r\nthere safe as public property; and there it might have stood to the end\r\nof the negotiations without a question, if a garrison had not been sent\r\ninto it. It was the faith on which they relied, that the Federal\r\nGovernment would take no position of hostility to them, that constituted\r\nits safety, and by which they lost the advantage they would have had in\r\nseizing it when unoccupied.\r\n\r\nI think that something is due to faith as well as fraternity; and I\r\nthink one of the increasing and accumulative obligations upon us to\r\nwithdraw the garrison from that fort is from the manner in which it was\r\ntaken--taken, as we heard by the reading of the paper yesterday, while\r\nCarolina remained under the assurance that the _status_ would not be\r\nviolated; while I was under that assurance, and half a dozen other\r\nSenators now within the sound of my voice felt secure under the same\r\npledge, that nothing would be done until negotiations had terminated,\r\nunless it was to withdraw the garrison. Then we, the Federal Government,\r\nbroke the faith; we committed the first act of hostility; and from this\r\nfirst act of hostility arose all those acts to which reference is made\r\nin the message as unprovoked aggressions--the seizing of forts\r\nelsewhere. Why were they seized? Self-preservation is the first law of\r\nnature; and when they no longer had confidence that this Federal\r\nGovernment would not seize the forts constructed for their defense, and\r\nuse them for their destruction, they only obeyed the dictates of\r\nself-preservation when they seized the forts to prevent the enemy from\r\ntaking possession of them as a means of coercion, for they then were\r\ncompelled to believe this Federal Government had become an enemy.\r\n\r\nNow, what is the remedy? To assure them that you do not intend to use\r\nphysical force against them is your first remedy; to assure them that\r\nyou intend to consider calmly all the propositions which they make, and\r\nto recognize the rights which the Union was established to secure; that\r\nyou intend to settle with them upon a basis in accordance with the\r\nDeclaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.\r\nWhen you do that, peace will prevail over the land, and force become a\r\nthing that no man will consider necessary.\r\n\r\nI am here confronted with a question which I will not argue. The\r\nposition which I have taken necessarily brings me to its consideration.\r\nWithout arguing it, I will merely state it. It is the right of a State\r\nto withdraw from the Union. The President says it is not a\r\nconstitutional right. The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Wade], and his ally,\r\nthe Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Johnson], argued it as no right at all.\r\nWell, let us see. What is meant by a constitutional right? Is it meant\r\nto be a right derived from the Constitution--a grant made in the\r\nConstitution? If that is what is meant, of course we all see at once\r\nthat we do not derive it in that way. Is it intended that it is not a\r\nconstitutional right, because it is not granted in the Constitution?\r\nThat shows, indeed, but a poor appreciation of the nature of our\r\nGovernment. All that is not granted in the Constitution belongs to the\r\nStates; and nothing but what is granted in the Constitution belongs to\r\nthe Federal Government; and, keeping this distinction in view, it\r\nrequires but little argument to see the conclusion at which we\r\nnecessarily arrive. Did the States surrender their sovereignty to the\r\nFederal Government? Did the States agree that they never could withdraw\r\nfrom the Federal Union?\r\n\r\nI know it has been argued here that the Confederation said the Articles\r\nof Confederation were to be a perpetual bond of union, and that the\r\nConstitution was made to form a more perfect union; that is to say, a\r\nGovernment beyond perpetuity, or one day, or two or three days, after\r\ndoomsday. But that has no foundation in the Constitution itself; it has\r\nno basis in the nature of our Government. The Constitution was a compact\r\nbetween independent States; it was not a national Government; and hence\r\nMr. Madison answered with such effectiveness to Patrick Henry, in the\r\nConvention of Virginia, which ratified the Constitution, denying his\r\nproposition that it was to form a nation, and stating to him the\r\nconclusive fact that \"we sit here as a convention of the State to ratify\r\nor reject that Constitution; and how, then, can you say that it forms a\r\nnation, and is adopted by the mass of the people?\" It was not adopted by\r\nthe mass of the people, as we all know historically; it was adopted by\r\neach State; each State, voluntarily ratifying it, entered the Union; and\r\nthat Union was formed whenever nine States should enter it; and, in\r\nabundance of caution, it was stated, in the resolutions of ratification\r\nof three of the States, that they still possessed the power to withdraw\r\nthe grants which they had delegated, whenever they should be used to\r\ntheir injury or oppression. I know it is said that this meant the people\r\nof all the States; but that is such an absurdity that I suppose it\r\nhardly necessary to answer it--for to speak of an elective Government\r\nrendering itself injurious and oppressive to the whole body of the\r\npeople by whom it is elected is such an absurdity that no man can\r\nbelieve it; and to suppose that a State convention, speaking for a\r\nState, and having no authority to speak for anybody else, would say that\r\nit was declaring what the people of the other States would do, would be\r\nan assumption altogether derogatory to the sound sense and well-known\r\nsentiments of the men who formed the Constitution and ratified it.\r\n\r\nBut in abundance of caution not only was this done, but the tenth\r\namendment of the Constitution declared that all which had not been\r\ndelegated was reserved to the States or to the people. Now, I ask, where\r\namong the delegated grants to the Federal Government do you find any\r\npower to coerce a State; where among the provisions of the Constitution\r\ndo you find any prohibition on the part of a State to withdraw; and, if\r\nyou find neither one nor the other, must not this power be in that great\r\ndepository, the reserved rights of the States? How was it ever taken out\r\nof that source of all power to be given to the Federal Government? It\r\nwas not delegated to the Federal Government; it was not prohibited to\r\nthe States; it necessarily remains, then, among the reserved powers of\r\nthe States.\r\n\r\nThis question has been so forcibly argued by the Senator from Louisiana\r\n[Mr. Benjamin] that I think it unnecessary to pursue it. Three times the\r\nproposition was made to give power to coerce the States, in the\r\nConvention, and as often refused--opposed as a proposition to make war\r\non a State, and refused on the ground that the Federal Government could\r\nnot make war upon a State. The Constitution was to form a Government for\r\nsuch States as should unite; it had no application beyond those who\r\nshould voluntarily adopt it. Among the delegated powers there is none\r\nwhich interferes with the exercise of the right of secession by a State.\r\nAs a right of sovereignty it remained to the States under the\r\nConfederation; and, if it did not, you arraign the faith of the men who\r\nframed the Constitution to which you appeal, for they provided that nine\r\nStates should secede from thirteen. Eleven did secede from the thirteen,\r\nand put themselves in the very position which, by a great abuse of\r\nlanguage, is to-day called treason, against the two States of North\r\nCarolina and Rhode Island; they still claiming to adhere to the\r\nperpetual Articles of Confederation, these eleven States absolving\r\nthemselves from the obligations which arose under them.\r\n\r\nThe Senator from Tennessee, to whom I must refer again--and I do so\r\nbecause he is a Southern Senator--taking the most hostile ground against\r\nus, refers to the State of Tennessee, and points to the time when that\r\nState may do those things which he has declared it an absurdity for any\r\nState to perform. I will read a single paragraph from his speech,\r\nshowing what his language is, in order that I may not, by any\r\npossibility, produce an impression upon others which his language does\r\nnot justify. Here are the expressions to which I refer. I call the\r\nSenator's attention to them:\r\n\r\n\"If there are grievances, why can not we all go together, and write them\r\ndown and point them out to our Northern friends after we have agreed on\r\nwhat those grievances were, and say: 'Here is what we demand; here our\r\nwrongs are enumerated; upon these terms we have agreed; and now, after\r\nwe have given you a reasonable time to consider these additional\r\nguarantees in order to protect ourselves against these wrongs, if you\r\nrefuse them, then, having made an honorable effort, having exhausted all\r\nother means, we may declare the association to be broken up, and we may\r\ngo into an act of revolution.' We can then say to them, 'You have\r\nrefused to give us guarantees that we think are needed for the\r\nprotection of our institutions and for the protection of our other\r\ninterests.' When they do this, I will go as far as he who goes the\r\nfarthest.\"\r\n\r\nNow, it does appear that he will go that far; and he goes a little\r\nfurther than anybody, I believe, who has spoken in vindication of the\r\nright, for he says:\r\n\r\n\"We do not intend that you shall drive us out of this House that was\r\nreared by the hands of our fathers. It is our House. It is the\r\nconstitutional House. We have a right here; and because you come forward\r\nand violate the ordinances of this House, I do not intend to go out;\r\nand, if you persist in the violation of the ordinances of the House, we\r\nintend to eject you from the building and retain the possession\r\nourselves.\"\r\n\r\nI wonder if this is what caused the artillery companies to be ordered\r\nhere, and the militia of this city to be organized? I think it was a\r\nmere figure of speech. I do not believe the Senator from Tennessee\r\nintended to kick you out of the House; and, if he did, let me say to\r\nyou, in all sincerity, we who claim the constitutional right of a State\r\nto withdraw from the Union do not intend to help him. He says, however,\r\nand this softens it a little:\r\n\r\n\"We do not think, though, that we have just cause for going out of the\r\nUnion now. We have just cause of complaint; but we are for remaining in\r\nthe Union, and fighting the battle like men.\"\r\n\r\nWhat does that mean? In the name of common sense, I ask how are we to\r\nfight in the Union? We take an oath of office to maintain the\r\nConstitution of the United States. The Constitution of the United States\r\nwas formed for domestic tranquillity; and how, then, are we to fight in\r\nthe Union? I have heard the proposition from others; but I have not\r\nunderstood it. I understand how men fight when they assume attitudes of\r\nhostility; but I do not understand how men, remaining connected together\r\nin a bond as brethren, sworn to mutual aid and protection, still propose\r\nto fight each other. I do not understand what the Senator means. If he\r\nchooses to answer my question, I am willing to hear him, for I do not\r\nunderstand how we are to fight in the Union.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson, of Tennessee: When my speech is taken altogether, I think\r\nmy meaning can be very easily understood. What I mean by fighting the\r\nbattle in the Union is, I think, very distinctly and clearly set forth\r\nin my speech; and, if the Senator will take it from beginning to end, I\r\napprehend that he will have no difficulty in ascertaining what I meant.\r\nBut, for his gratification upon this particular point, I will repeat, in\r\nsubstance, what I then said as to fighting the battle in the Union. I\r\nmeant that we should remain here under the Constitution of the United\r\nStates and contend for all its guarantees; and by preserving the\r\nConstitution and all its guarantees we would preserve the Union. Our\r\ntrue place, to maintain these guarantees and to preserve the\r\nConstitution, is in the Union, there to fight our battle. How? By\r\nargument; by appeals to the patriotism, to the good sense, and to the\r\njudgment of the whole country; by showing the people that the\r\nConstitution had been violated; that all its guarantees were not\r\ncomplied with; and I have entertained the hope that, when they were\r\npossessed of that fact, there would be found patriotism and honesty\r\nenough in the great mass of the people, North and South, to come forward\r\nand do what was just and right between the contending sections of the\r\ncountry. I meant that the true way to fight the battle was for us to\r\nremain here and occupy the places assigned to us by the Constitution of\r\nthe country. Why did I make that statement? It was because on the 4th\r\nday of March next we shall have six majority in this body; and if, as\r\nsome apprehended, the incoming Administration shall show any disposition\r\nto make encroachments upon the institution of slavery, encroachments\r\nupon the rights of the States, or any other violation of the\r\nConstitution, we, by remaining in the Union, and standing at our places,\r\nwill have the power to resist all these encroachments. How? We have the\r\npower even to reject the appointment of the Cabinet officers of the\r\nincoming President. Then, should we not be fighting the battles in the\r\nUnion, by resisting even the organization of the Administration in a\r\nconstitutional mode, and thus, at the very start, disable an\r\nAdministration which was likely to encroach on our rights and to violate\r\nthe Constitution of the country? So far as appointing even a Minister\r\nabroad is concerned, the incoming Administration will have no power\r\nwithout our consent, if we remain here. It comes into office handcuffed,\r\npowerless to do harm. We, standing here, hold the balance of power in\r\nour hands; we can resist it at the very threshold effectually; and do it\r\ninside of the Union, and in our House. The incoming Administration has\r\nnot even the power to appoint a postmaster whose salary exceeds one\r\nthousand dollars a year, without consultation with and the acquiescence\r\nof the Senate of the United States. The President has not even the power\r\nto draw his salary--his twenty-five thousand dollars per annum--unless\r\nwe appropriate it. I contend, then, that the true place to fight the\r\nbattle is in the Union, and within the provisions of the Constitution.\r\nThe army and navy cannot be sustained without appropriations by\r\nCongress; and, if we were apprehensive that encroachments would be made\r\non the Southern States and on their institutions, in violation of the\r\nConstitution, we could prevent him from having a dollar even to feed his\r\narmy or his navy.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis: I receive the answer from the Senator, and I think I\r\ncomprehend now that he is not going to use any force, but it is a sort\r\nof fighting that is to be done by votes and words; and I think,\r\ntherefore, the President need not bring artillery and order out the\r\nmilitia to suppress them. I think, altogether, we are not in danger of\r\nmuch bloodshed in the mode proposed by the Senator from Tennessee.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson: I had not quite done; but if the Senator is satisfied--\r\n\r\nMr. Davis: Quite satisfied. I am entirely satisfied that the answer of\r\nthe Senator shows me he did not intend to fight at all; that it was a\r\nmere figure of speech, and does not justify converting the Federal\r\ncapital into a military camp. But it is a sort of revolution which he\r\nproposes; it is a revolution under the forms of the Government. Now, I\r\nhave to say, once for all, that, as long as I am a Senator here, I will\r\nnot use the powers I possess to destroy the very Government to which I\r\nam accredited. I will not attempt, in the language of the Senator, to\r\nhandcuff the President. I will not attempt to destroy the Administration\r\nby refusing any officers to administer its functions. I should vote, as\r\nI have done in Administrations to which I stood in nearest relation,\r\nagainst a bad nomination; but I never would agree, under the forms of\r\nthe Constitution, and with the powers I bear as a Senator of the United\r\nStates, to turn those powers to the destruction of the Government I was\r\nsent to support. I leave that to gentlemen who take the oath with a\r\nmental reservation. It is not my policy. If I must have revolution, I\r\nsay let it be a revolution such as our fathers made when they were\r\ndenied their natural rights.\r\n\r\nSo much for that. It has quieted apprehension; and I hope that the\r\nartillery will not be brought here; that the militia will not be called\r\nout; and that the female schools will continue their sessions as\r\nheretofore. [Laughter.] The authority of Mr. Madison, however, was\r\nrelied on by the Senator from Tennessee; and he read fairly an extract\r\nfrom Mr. Madison's letter to Mr. Webster, and I give him credit for\r\nreading what it seems to me destroys his whole argument. It is this\r\nclause:\r\n\r\n\"The powers of the Government being exercised, as in other elective and\r\nresponsible governments, under the control of its constituents, the\r\npeople, and the Legislatures of the States, and subject to the\r\nrevolutionary rights of the people in extreme cases.\"\r\n\r\nNow, sir, we are confusing language very much. Men speak of revolution;\r\nand when they say revolution they mean blood. Our fathers meant nothing\r\nof the sort. When they spoke of revolution they meant an unalienable\r\nright. When they declared as an unalienable right the power of the\r\npeople to abrogate and modify their form of government whenever it did\r\nnot answer the ends for which it was established, they did not mean that\r\nthey were to sustain that by brute force. They meant that it was a\r\nright; and force could only be invoked when that right was wrongfully\r\ndenied. Great Britain denied the right in the case of the colonies, and\r\ntherefore our revolution for independence was bloody. If Great Britain\r\nhad admitted the great American doctrine, there would have been no blood\r\nshed; and does it become the descendants of those who proclaimed this as\r\nthe great principle on which they took their place among the nations of\r\nthe earth, now to proclaim, if that is a right, it is one which you can\r\nonly get as the subjects of the Emperor of Austria may get their rights,\r\nby force overcoming force? Are we, in this age of civilization and\r\npolitical progress, when political philosophy had advanced to the point\r\nwhich seemed to render it possible that the millennium should now be\r\nseen by prophetic eyes--are we now to roll back the whole current of\r\nhuman thought, and again to return to the mere brute force which\r\nprevails between beasts of prey, as the only method of settling\r\nquestions between men?\r\n\r\nIf the Declaration of Independence be true (and who here gainsays it?),\r\nevery community may dissolve its connection with any other community\r\npreviously made, and have no other obligation than that which results\r\nfrom the breach of an alliance between States. Is it to be supposed;\r\ncould any man, reasoning _a priori_, come to the conclusion that the men\r\nwho fought the battles of the Revolution for community independence--\r\nthat the men who struggled against the then greatest military power on\r\nthe face of the globe in order that they might possess those unalienable\r\nrights which they had declared--terminated their great efforts by\r\ntransmitting posterity to a condition in which they could only gain\r\nthose rights by force? If so, the blood of the Revolution was shed in\r\nvain; no great principles were established; for force was the law of\r\nnature before the battles of the Revolution were fought.\r\n\r\nI see, then--if gentlemen insist on using the word \"revolution\" in the\r\nsense of a resort to force--a very great difference between their\r\nopinion and that of Mr. Madison. Mr. Madison put the rights of the\r\npeople over and above everything else, and he said this was the\r\nGovernment _de jure_ and _de facto_. Call it by what name you will, he\r\nunderstood ours to be a Government of the people. The people never have\r\nseparated themselves from those rights which our fathers had declared to\r\nbe unalienable. They did not delegate to the Federal Government the\r\npowers which the British Crown exercised over the colonies; they did not\r\nachieve their independence for any purpose so low as that. They left us\r\nto the inheritance of freemen, living in independent communities, the\r\nStates united for the purposes which they thought would bless posterity.\r\nIt is in the exercise of this reserved right as defined by Mr. Madison,\r\nas one to which all the powers of Government are subject, that the\r\npeople of a State in convention have claimed to resume the functions\r\nwhich in like manner they had made to the Federal Government....\r\n\r\nThe question which now presents itself to the country is, What shall we\r\ndo with events as they stand? Shall we allow this separation to be\r\ntotal? Shall we render it peaceful, with a view to the chance that, when\r\nhunger shall brighten the intellects of men, and the teachings of hard\r\nexperience shall have tamed them, they may come back, in the spirit of\r\nour fathers, to the task of reconstruction? Or will they have that\r\nseparation partial; will they give to each State all its military power;\r\nwill they give to each State its revenue power; will they still preserve\r\nthe common agent, and will they thus carry on a Government different\r\nfrom that which now exists, yet not separating the States so entirely as\r\nto make the work of reconstruction equal to a new creation; not\r\nseparating them so as to render it utterly impossible to administer any\r\nfunctions of the Government in security and peace?\r\n\r\nI waive the question of duality, considering that a dual Executive would\r\nbe the institution of a King Log. I consider a dual legislative\r\ndepartment would be to bring into antagonism the representatives of two\r\ndifferent countries, to war perpetually, and thus to continue, not\r\nunion, but the irrepressible conflict. There is no duality possible\r\n(unless there be two confederacies) which seems to me consistent with\r\nthe interests of either or of both. It might be that two confederacies\r\ncould be so organized as to answer jointly many of the ends of our\r\npresent Union; it might be that States, agreeing with each other in\r\ntheir internal policy--having a similarity of interests and an identity\r\nof purpose--might associate together, and that these two confederacies\r\nmight have relations to each other so close as to give them a united\r\npower in time of war against any foreign nation. These things are\r\npossibilities; these things it becomes us to contemplate; these things\r\nit devolves on the majority section to consider now; for with every\r\nmotion of that clock is passing away your opportunity. It was greater\r\nwhen we met on the first Monday in December than it is now; it is\r\ngreater now than it will be on the first day of next week. We have\r\nwaited long; we have come to the conclusion that you mean to do nothing.\r\nIn the Committee of Thirteen, where the resolutions of the Senator from\r\nKentucky [Mr. Crittenden] were considered, various attempts were made,\r\nbut no prospect of any agreement on which it was possible for us to\r\nstand, in security for the future, could be matured. I offered a\r\nproposition, which was but the declaration of that which the\r\nConstitution announces; but that which the Supreme Court had, from time\r\nto time, and from an early period asserted; but that which was necessary\r\nfor equality in the Union. Not one single vote of the Republican portion\r\nof that committee was given for the proposition.\r\n\r\nLooking, then, upon separation as inevitable, not knowing how that\r\nseparation is to occur, or at least what States it is to embrace, there\r\nremains to us, I believe, as the consideration which is most useful, the\r\ninquiry, How can this separation be effected so as to leave to us the\r\npower, whenever we shall have the will, to reconstruct? It can only be\r\ndone by adopting a policy of peace. It can only be done by denying to\r\nthe Federal Government all power to coerce. It can only be done by\r\nreturning to the point from which we started, and saying, \"This is a\r\nGovernment of fraternity, a Government of consent, and it shall not be\r\nadministered in a departure from those principles.\"\r\n\r\nI do not regard the failure of our constitutional Union, as very many\r\ndo, to be the failure of self-government--to be conclusive in all future\r\ntime of the unfitness of man to govern himself. Our State governments\r\nhave charge of nearly all the relations of person and property. This\r\nFederal Government was instituted mainly as a common agent for foreign\r\npurposes, for free trade among the States, and for common defense.\r\nRepresentative liberty will remain in the States after they are\r\nseparated. Liberty was not crushed by the separation of the colonies\r\nfrom the mother-country, then the most constitutional monarchy and the\r\nfreest Government known. Still less will liberty be destroyed by the\r\nseparation of these States, to prevent the destruction of the spirit of\r\nthe Constitution by the mal-administration of it. There will be\r\ninjury--injury to all; differing in degree, differing in manner. The\r\ninjury to the manufacturing and navigating States will be to their\r\ninternal prosperity. The injury to the Southern States will be mainly to\r\ntheir foreign commerce. All will feel the deprivation of that high pride\r\nand power which belong to the flag now representing the greatest\r\nrepublic, if not the greatest Government, upon the face of the globe. I\r\nwould that it still remained to consider what we might calmly have\r\nconsidered on the first Monday in December--how this could be avoided;\r\nbut events have rolled past that point. You would not make propositions\r\nwhen they would have been effective. I presume you will not make them\r\nnow; and I know not what effect they would have if you did. Your\r\npropositions would have been most welcome if they had been made before\r\nany question of coercion, and before any vain boasting of power; for\r\npride and passion do not often take counsel of pecuniary interest, at\r\nleast among those whom I represent. But you have chosen to take the\r\npolicy of clinging to words [the Chicago platform], in disregard of\r\npassing events, and have hastened them onward. It is true, as shown by\r\nthe history of all revolutions, that they are most precipitated and\r\nintensified by obstinacy and vacillation. The want of a policy, the\r\nobstinate adherence to unimportant things, have brought us to a\r\ncondition where I close my eyes, because I can not see anything that\r\nencourages me to hope.\r\n\r\nIn the long period which elapsed after the downfall of the great\r\nrepublics of the East, when despotism seemed to brood over the civilized\r\nworld, and only here and there constitutional monarchy even was able to\r\nrear its head--when all the great principles of republican and\r\nrepresentative government had sunk deep, fathomless, into the sea of\r\nhuman events--it was then that the storm of our Revolution moved the\r\nwaters. The earth, the air, and the sea became brilliant; and from the\r\nfoam of ages rose the constellation which was set in the political\r\nfirmament, as a sign of unity and confederation and community\r\nindependence, coexistent with confederate strength. That constellation\r\nhas served to bless our people. Nay, more; its light has been thrown on\r\nforeign lands, and its regenerative power will outlive, perhaps, the\r\nGovernment as a sign for which it was set. It may be pardoned to me,\r\nsir, who, in my boyhood, was given to the military service, and who have\r\nfollowed, under tropical suns and over northern snows, the flag of the\r\nUnion, if I here express the deep sorrow which always overwhelms me when\r\nI think of taking a last leave of that object of early affection and\r\nproud association; feeling that henceforth it is not to be the banner\r\nwhich, by day and by night, I was ready to follow; to hail with the\r\nrising and bless with the setting sun. But God, who knows the hearts of\r\nmen, will judge between you and us, at whose door lies the\r\nresponsibility. Men will see the efforts made, here and elsewhere; that\r\nwe have been silent when words would not avail, and have curbed an\r\nimpatient temper, and hoped that conciliatory counsels might do that\r\nwhich could not be effected by harsh means. And yet, the only response\r\nwhich has come from the other side has been a stolid indifference, as\r\nthough it mattered not: \"Let the temple fall, we do not care!\" Sirs,\r\nremember that such conduct is offensive, and that men may become\r\nindifferent even to the objects of their early attachments.\r\n\r\nIf our Government should fail, it will not be from the defect of the\r\nsystem, though each planet was set to revolve in an orbit of its own,\r\neach moving by its own impulse, yet being all attracted by the\r\naffections and interests which countervailed each other; there was no\r\ninherent tendency to disruption. It has been the perversion of the\r\nConstitution; it has been the substitution of theories of morals for\r\nprinciples of government; it has been forcing crude opinions upon the\r\ndomestic institutions of others, which has disturbed these planets in\r\ntheir orbit; it is this which threatens to destroy the constellation\r\nwhich, in its power and its glory, had been gathering stars one after\r\nanother, until, from thirteen, it had risen to thirty-three.\r\n\r\nIf we accept the argument of to-day in favor of coercion as the theory\r\nof our Government, its only effect will be to precipitate men who have\r\npride and self-reliance into the assertion of the freedom and\r\nindependence to which they were born. Our fathers would never have\r\nentered into a confederate Government which had within itself the power\r\nof coercion; they would not agree to remain one day in such a Government\r\nafter I had the power to get out of it. To argue that the man who\r\nfollows the mandate of his State, resuming her sovereign jurisdiction\r\nand power, is disloyal to his allegiance to the United States, which\r\nallegiance he only owed through his State, is such a confusion of ideas\r\nas does not belong to an ordinary comprehension of our Government. It is\r\ntreason to the principle of community independence. It is to recur to\r\nthat doctrine of passive obedience which, in England, cost one monarch\r\nhis head and drove another into exile; a doctrine which, since the\r\nRevolution of 1688, has obtained nowhere where men speak the English\r\ntongue. Yet all this it is needful to admit, before we accept this\r\ndoctrine of coercion, which is to send an army and a navy to do that\r\nwhich there are no courts to perform; to execute the law without a\r\njudicial decision, and without an officer to serve process. This, I say,\r\nwould degrade us to the basest despotism under which man could live--the\r\ndespotism of a many-headed monster, without the sensibility or regardful\r\nconsideration which might belong to an hereditary king.[207]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is a strange similarity in the position of affairs at the present\r\nday to that which the colonies occupied. Lord North asserted the right\r\nto collect the revenue, and insisted on collecting it by force. He sent\r\ntroops to Boston Harbor and to Charlestown, and he quartered troops in\r\nthose towns. The result was, collision; and out of that collision came\r\nthe separation of the colonies from the mother-country. The same thing\r\nis being attempted to-day. Not the law, not the civil magistrate, but\r\ntroops, are relied upon now to execute the laws. To gather taxes in the\r\nSouthern ports, the army and navy must be sent to perform the functions\r\nof magistrates. It is the old case over again. Senators of the North,\r\nyou are reënacting the blunders which statesmen in Great Britain\r\ncommitted; but among you there are some who, like Chatham and Burke,\r\nthough not of our section, yet are vindicating our rights.\r\n\r\nI have heard, with some surprise, for it seemed to me idle, the\r\nrepetition of the assertion heretofore made, that the cause of the\r\nseparation was the election of Mr. Lincoln. It may be a source of\r\ngratification to some gentlemen that their friend is elected; but no\r\nindividual had the power to produce the existing state of things. It was\r\nthe purpose, the end, it was the declaration by himself and his friends,\r\nwhich constitute the necessity of providing new safeguards for\r\nourselves. The man was nothing, save as he was the representative of\r\nopinions, of a policy, of purposes, of power, to inflict upon us those\r\nwrongs to which freemen never tamely submit.\r\n\r\nSenators, I have spoken longer than I desired. I had supposed it was\r\npossible, avoiding argument and not citing authority, to have made to\r\nyou a brief address. It was thought useless to argue a question which\r\nnow belongs to the past. The time is near at hand when the places which\r\nhave known us as colleagues laboring together can know us in that\r\nrelation no more for ever. I have striven to avert the catastrophe which\r\nnow impends over the country, unsuccessfully; and I regret it. For the\r\nfew days which I may remain, I am willing to labor in order that that\r\ncatastrophe shall be as little as possible destructive to public peace\r\nand prosperity. If you desire at this last moment to avert civil war, so\r\nbe it; it is better so. If you will but allow us to separate from you\r\npeaceably, since we can not live peaceably together, to leave with the\r\nrights we had before we were united, since we can not enjoy them in the\r\nUnion, then there are many relations which may still subsist between us,\r\ndrawn from the associations of our struggles from the Revolutionary era\r\nto the present day, which may be beneficial to you as well as to us.\r\n\r\nIf you will not have it thus--if in the pride of power, if in contempt\r\nof reason, and reliance upon force, you say we shall not go, but shall\r\nremain as subjects to you--then, gentlemen of the North, a war is to be\r\ninaugurated the like of which men have not seen. Sufficiently numerous\r\non both sides, in close contact, with only imaginary lines of division,\r\nand with many means of approach, each sustained by productive sections,\r\nthe people of which will give freely both of money and of store, the\r\nconflicts must be multiplied indefinitely, and masses of men, sacrificed\r\nto the demon of civil war, will furnish hecatombs, such as the recent\r\ncampaign in Italy did not offer. At the end of all this what will you\r\nhave effected? Destruction upon both sides; subjugation upon neither; a\r\ntreaty of peace leaving both torn and bleeding; the wail of the widow\r\nand the cry of the orphan substituted for those peaceful notes of\r\ndomestic happiness that now prevail throughout the land; and then you\r\nwill agree that each is to pursue his separate course as best he may.\r\nThis is to be the end of war. Through a long series of years you may\r\nwaste your strength, distress your people, and yet at last must come to\r\nthe position which you might have had at first, had justice and reason,\r\ninstead of selfishness and passion, folly and crime, dictated your\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nIs there wisdom, is there patriotism in the land? If so, easy must be\r\nthe solution of this question. If not, then Mississippi's gallant sons\r\nwill stand like a wall of fire around their State; and I go hence, not\r\nin hostility to you, but in love and allegiance to her, to take my place\r\namong her sons, be it for good or for evil.\r\n\r\nI shall probably never again attempt to utter here the language either\r\nof warning or of argument. I leave the case in your hands. If you solve\r\nit not before I go, you will have still to decide it. Toward you\r\nindividually, as well as to those whom you represent, I would that I had\r\nthe power now to say there shall be peace between us for ever. I would\r\nthat I had the power now to say the intercourse and the commerce between\r\nthe States, if they can not live in one Union, shall still be\r\nuninterrupted; that all the social relations shall remain undisturbed;\r\nthat the son in Mississippi shall visit freely his father in Maine, and\r\nthe reverse; and that each shall be welcomed when he goes to the other,\r\nnot by himself alone, but also by his neighbors; and that all that\r\nkindly intercourse which has subsisted between the different sections of\r\nthe Union shall continue to exist. This is not only for the interest of\r\nall, but it is my profoundest wish, my sincerest desire, that such\r\nremnant of that which is passing away may grace the memory of a glorious\r\nthough too brief existence.\r\n\r\nDay by day you have become more and more exasperated. False reports have\r\nled you to suppose there was in our section hostility to you with\r\nmanifestations which did not exist. In one case, I well remember when\r\nthe Senator from Vermont [Mr. Collamer] was serving with me on a special\r\ncommittee, it was reported that a gentleman who had gone from a\r\ncommercial house in New York had been inhumanly treated at Vicksburg,\r\nand this embarrassed a question which we then had pending. I wrote to\r\nVicksburg for information, and my friends could not learn that such a\r\nman had ever been there; but, if he had been there, no violence\r\ncertainly had been offered to him. Falsehood and suspicion have thus led\r\nyou on step by step in the career of crimination, and perhaps has\r\ninduced to some part of your aggression. Such evil effects we have\r\nheretofore suffered, and the consequences now have their fatal\r\nculmination. On the verge of war, distrust and passion increase the\r\ndanger. To-day it is in the power of two bad men, at the opposite ends\r\nof the telegraphic line between Washington and Charleston, to\r\nprecipitate the State of South Carolina and the United States into a\r\nconflict of arms without other cause to have produced it.\r\n\r\nAnd still will you hesitate; still will you do nothing? Will you sit\r\nwith sublime indifference and allow events to shape themselves? No\r\nlonger can you say the responsibility is upon the Executive. He has\r\nthrown it upon you. He has notified you that he can do nothing; and you\r\ntherefore know he will do nothing. He has told you the responsibility\r\nnow rests with Congress; and I close as I began, by invoking you to meet\r\nthat responsibility, bravely to act the patriot's part. If you will, the\r\nangel of peace may spread her wings, though it be over divided States;\r\nand the sons of the sires of the Revolution may still go on in friendly\r\nintercourse with each other, ever renewing the memories of a common\r\norigin; the sections, by the diversity of their products and habits,\r\nacting and reacting beneficially, the commerce of each may swell the\r\nprosperity of both, and the happiness of all be still interwoven\r\ntogether. Thus may it be; and thus it is in your power to make it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 207: Here occurred a colloquy with another Senator, followed\r\nby some paragraphs not essential to the completeness of the subject.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrespondence and extracts from correspondence relative to Fort Sumter,\r\nfrom the affair of the Star of the West, January 9, 1861, to the\r\nwithdrawal of the envoy of South Carolina from Washington, February 8,\r\n1861.\r\n\r\n_Major Anderson to the Governor of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nTo his Excellency the Governor of South Carolina._\r\n\r\nSir: Two of your batteries fired this morning upon an unarmed vessel\r\nbearing the flag of my Government. As I have not been notified that war\r\nhas been declared by South Carolina against the Government of the United\r\nStates, I can not but think that this hostile act was committed without\r\nyour sanction or authority. Under that hope, and that alone, did I\r\nrefrain from opening fire upon your batteries.\r\n\r\nI have the honor, therefore, respectfully to ask whether the\r\nabove-mentioned act--one I believe without a parallel in the history of\r\nour country, or of any other civilized Government--was committed in\r\nobedience to your instructions, and to notify you, if it be not\r\ndisclaimed, that I must regard it as an act of war, and that I shall\r\nnot, after a reasonable time for the return of my messenger, permit any\r\nvessels to pass within range of the guns of my fort.\r\n\r\nIn order to save as far as in my power the shedding of blood, I beg that\r\nyou will have due notification of this my decision given to all\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nHoping, however, that your answer may be such as will justify a further\r\ncontinuance of forbearance on my part, I have the honor to be,\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nROBERT ANDERSON,\r\n\r\n_Major First Artillery U. S. A., commanding_.\r\n\r\nFort Sumter, South Carolina, _January 9, 1861_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extracts from reply of the Governor to Major Anderson_.\r\n\r\nState of South Carolina, Executive Office, Headquarters,\r\n\r\nCharleston, _January 9, 1861_.\r\n\r\nSir: Your letter has been received. In it you make certain statements\r\nwhich very plainly show that you have not been fully informed by your\r\nGovernment of the precise relations which now exist between it and the\r\nState of South Carolina. Official information has been communicated to\r\nthe Government of the United States that the political connection\r\nheretofore existing between the State of South Carolina and the States\r\nwhich were known as the United States had ceased, and that the State of\r\nSouth Carolina had resumed all the power it had delegated to the United\r\nStates under the compact known as the Constitution of the United States.\r\nThe right which the State of South Carolina possessed to change the\r\npolitical relations it held with other States, under the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, has been solemnly asserted by the people of this\r\nState, in convention, and now does not admit of discussion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe attempt to reënforce the troops now at Fort Sumter, or to retake and\r\nresume possession of the forts within the waters of this State, which\r\nyou have abandoned, after spiking the guns placed there, and doing\r\notherwise much damage, can not be regarded by the authorities of this\r\nState as indicative of any other purpose than the coercion of the State\r\nby the armed force of the Government. To repel such an attempt is too\r\nplainly its duty to allow it to be discussed. But, while defending its\r\nwaters, the authorities of the State have been careful so to conduct the\r\naffairs of the State that no act, however necessary for its defense,\r\nshould lead to a useless waste of life. Special agents, therefore, have\r\nbeen off the bar, to warn all approaching vessels, if armed, or unarmed\r\nand having troops to reënforce the forts on board, not to enter the\r\nharbor of Charleston; and special orders have been given to the\r\ncommanders of all the forts and batteries not to fire at such vessels\r\nuntil a shot fired across their bows would warn them of the prohibition\r\nof the State.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the Star of the West, it is understood, this\r\nmorning attempted to enter this harbor, with troops on board; and,\r\nhaving been notified that she could not enter, was fired into. The act\r\nis perfectly justified by me.\r\n\r\nIn regard to your threat in relation to vessels in the harbor, it is\r\nonly necessary to say, that you must judge of your responsibilities.\r\nYour position in this harbor has been tolerated by the authorities of\r\nthe State. And, while the act of which you complain is in perfect\r\nconsistency with the rights and duties of the State, it is not perceived\r\nhow far the conduct which you propose to adopt can find a parallel in\r\nthe history of any country, or be reconciled with any other purpose of\r\nyour Government than that of imposing upon this State the condition of a\r\nconquered province.\r\n\r\nF. W. PICKENS.\r\n\r\nTo Major Robert Anderson, _commanding Fort Sumter_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Major Anderson to the Governor._\r\n\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, Fort Sumter, South Carolina, _January 9, 1861_.\r\n\r\nTo his Excellency F. W. PICKENS,\r\n\r\n_Governor of the State of South Carolina._\r\n\r\nSir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication\r\nof to-day, and to say that, under the circumstances, I have deemed it\r\nproper to refer the whole matter to my Government; and that I intend\r\ndeferring the course indicated in my note of this morning until the\r\narrival from Washington of the instructions I may receive. I have the\r\nhonor also to express a hope that no obstructions will be placed in the\r\nway of, and that you will do me the favor to afford every facility to,\r\nthe departure and return of the bearer, Lieutenant T. Talbot, U. S.\r\nArmy, who has been directed to make the journey.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully,\r\n\r\nROBERT ANDERSON,\r\n\r\n_Major U. S. Army, commanding._\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Governor to the President of the United States._\r\n\r\n\r\nState of South Carolina, Executive Office,\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, Charleston, _January 11, 1861_.\r\n\r\nSir: At the time of the separation of the State of South Carolina from\r\nthe United States, Fort Sumter was, and still is, in the possession of\r\ntroops of the United States, under the command of Major Anderson. I\r\nregard that possession as not consistent with the dignity or safety of\r\nthe State of South Carolina; and I have this day addressed to Major\r\nAnderson a communication to obtain from him the possession of that fort,\r\nby the authorities of this State. The reply of Major Anderson informs me\r\nthat he has no authority to do what I required, but he desires a\r\nreference of the demand to the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances now existing, and which need no comment by me, I\r\nhave determined to send to you the Hon. I. W. Hayne, the\r\nAttorney-General of the State of South Carolina, and have instructed him\r\nto demand the delivery of Fort Sumter, in the harbor of Charleston, to\r\nthe constituted authorities of the State of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe demand I have made of Major Anderson, and which I now make of you,\r\nis suggested because of my earnest desire to avoid the bloodshed which a\r\npersistence in your attempt to retain the possession of that fort will\r\ncause, and which will be unavailing to secure you that possession, but\r\ninduce a calamity most deeply to be deplored.\r\n\r\nIf consequences so unhappy shall ensue, I will secure for this State, in\r\nthe demand which I now make, the satisfaction of having exhausted every\r\nattempt to avoid it.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the public property of the United States within Fort\r\nSumter, the Hon. I. W. Hayne, who will hand you this communication, is\r\nauthorized to give you the pledge of the State that the valuation of\r\nsuch property will be accounted for, by this State, upon the adjustment\r\nof its relations with the United States, of which it was a part.\r\n\r\nF. W. PICKENS.\r\n\r\n_To the_ President _of the United States_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extracts from instructions of the State Department of South Carolina to\r\nHon. I. W. Hayne_.\r\n\r\n\r\nState of South Carolina, Executive Office,\r\n\r\nState Department, Charleston, _January 12, 1861_.\r\n\r\nSir: The Governor has considered it proper, in view of the grave\r\nquestions which now affect the State of South Carolina and the United\r\nStates, to make a demand upon the President of the United States for the\r\ndelivery to the State of South Carolina of Fort Sumter, now within the\r\nterritorial limits of this Sate and occupied by troops of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou are now instructed to proceed to Washington, and there, in the name\r\nof the government of the State of South Carolina, inquire of the\r\nPresident of the United States whether it was by his order that troops\r\nof the United States were sent into the harbor of Charleston to\r\nreënforce Fort Sumter; if he avows that order, you will then inquire\r\nwhether he asserts a right to introduce troops of the United States\r\nwithin the limits of this State, to occupy Fort Sumter; and you will, in\r\ncase of his avowal, inform him that neither will be permitted, and\r\neither will be regarded as his declaration of war against the State of\r\nSouth Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe Governor, to save life, and determined to omit no course of\r\nproceeding usual among civilized nations, previous to that condition of\r\ngeneral hostilities which belongs to war, and not knowing under what\r\norder, or by what authority, Fort Sumter is now held, demanded from\r\nMajor Robert Anderson, now in command of that fort, its delivery to the\r\nState. That officer, in his reply, has referred the Governor to the\r\nGovernment of the United States at Washington. You will, therefore,\r\ndemand from the President of the United States the withdrawal of the\r\ntroops of the United States from that fort, and its delivery to the\r\nState of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nYou are instructed not to allow any question of property claimed by the\r\nUnited States to embarrass the assertion of the political right of the\r\nState of South Carolina to the possession of Fort Sumter. The possession\r\nof that fort by the State is alone consistent with the dignity and\r\nsafety of the State of South Carolina; but such possession is not\r\ninconsistent with a right to compensation in money in another\r\nGovernment, if it has against the State of South Carolina any just claim\r\nconnected with that fort. But the possession of the fort can not, in\r\nregard to the State of South Carolina, be compensated by any\r\nconsideration of any kind from the Government of the United States, when\r\nthe possession of it by the Government is invasive of the dignity and\r\naffects the safety of the State. That possession can not become now a\r\nmatter of discussion or negotiation. You will, therefore, require from\r\nthe President of the United States a positive and distinct answer to\r\nyour demand for the delivery of the fort. And you are further authorized\r\nto give the pledge of the State to adjust all matters which may be, and\r\nare in their nature, susceptible of valuation in money, in the manner\r\nmost usual, and upon the principles of equity and justice always\r\nrecognized by independent nations, for the ascertainment of their\r\nrelative rights and obligations in such matters....\r\n\r\nRespectfully, your obedient servant, A. G. MAGRATH.\r\n\r\n_To Hon._ W. Hayne, _special envoy from the State of South Carolina to\r\nthe President of the United States_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter of Senators of seceding States to Hon. I. W. Hayne_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington City, _January 15, 1861_.\r\n\r\nHon. Isaac W. Hayne.\r\n\r\nSir: We are apprised that you visit Washington, as an envoy from the\r\nState of South Carolina, bearing a communication from the Governor of\r\nyour State to the President of the United States, in relation to Fort\r\nSumter. Without knowing its contents, we venture to request you to defer\r\nits delivery to the President for a few days, or until you and he have\r\nconsidered the suggestions which we beg leave to submit.\r\n\r\nWe know that the possession of Fort Sumter by troops of the United\r\nStates, coupled with the circumstances under which it was taken, is the\r\nchief, if not only, source of difficulty between the government of South\r\nCarolina and that of the United States. We would add that we, too, think\r\nit a just cause of irritation and of apprehension on the part of your\r\nState. But we have also assurances, notwithstanding the circumstances\r\nunder which Major Anderson left Fort Moultrie and entered Fort Sumter\r\nwith the forces under his command, that it was not taken, and is not\r\nheld, with any hostile or unfriendly purpose toward your State, but\r\nmerely as property of the United States, which the President deems it\r\nhis duty to protect and preserve.\r\n\r\nWe will not discuss the question of right or duty on the part of either\r\nGovernment touching that property, or the late acts of either in\r\nrelation thereto; but we think that, without any compromise of right or\r\nbreach of duty on either side, an amicable adjustment of the matter of\r\ndifferences may and should be adopted. We desire to see such an\r\nadjustment, and to prevent war or the shedding of blood. We represent\r\nStates which have already seceded from the United States, or will have\r\ndone so before the 1st of February next, and which will meet your State\r\nin convention on or before the 15th of that month. Our people feel that\r\nthey have a common destiny with your people, and expect to form with\r\nthem, in that Convention, a new Confederation and Provisional\r\nGovernment. We must and will share your fortunes, suffering with you the\r\nevils of war if it can not be avoided; and enjoying with you the\r\nblessings of peace, if it can be preserved. We, therefore, think it\r\nespecially due from South Carolina to our States--to say nothing of\r\nother slaveholding States--that she should, as far as she can,\r\nconsistently with her honor, avoid initiating hostilities between her\r\nand the United States or any other power. We have the public declaration\r\nof the President that he has not the constitutional power or the will to\r\nmake war on South Carolina, and that the public peace shall not be\r\ndisturbed by any act of hostility toward your State.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, see no reason why there may not be a settlement of\r\nexisting difficulties, if time be given for calm and deliberate counsel\r\nwith those States which are equally involved with South Carolina. We,\r\ntherefore, trust that an arrangement will be agreed on between you and\r\nthe President, at least till the 15th of February next; by which time\r\nyour and our States may, in convention, devise a wise, just, and\r\npeaceable solution of existing difficulties.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, we think your State should suffer Major Anderson to\r\nobtain necessary supplies of food, fuel, or water, and enjoy free\r\ncommunication, by post or special messenger, with the President; upon\r\nthe understanding that the President will not send him reënforcements\r\nduring the same period. We propose to submit this proposition and your\r\nanswer to the President.\r\n\r\nIf not clothed with power to make such arrangement, then we trust that\r\nyou will submit our suggestions to the Governor of your State for his\r\ninstructions. Until you have received and communicated his response to\r\nthe President, of course your State will not attack Fort Sumter, and the\r\nPresident will not offer to reënforce it.\r\n\r\nWe most respectfully submit these propositions, in the earnest hope that\r\nyou, or the proper authority of your State, may accede to them.\r\n\r\nWe have the honor to be, with profound esteem,\r\n\r\nYour obedient servants,\r\n\r\nLOUIS T. WIGFALL,\r\nJOHN HEMPHILL,\r\nD. L. YULEE,\r\nS. R. MALLORY,\r\nJEFFERSON DAVIS,\r\nC. C. CLAY, Jr.,\r\nBENJAMIN FITZPATRICK,\r\nA. IVERSON,\r\nJOHN SLIDELL,\r\nJ. P.

Hayne in reply to Senators from seceding States._\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, _January, 1861_.\r\n\r\nGentlemen: I have just received your communication, dated the 15th\r\ninstant. You represent, you say, States which have already seceded from\r\nthe United States, or _will have_ done so before the 1st of February\r\nnext, and which will meet South Carolina in convention, on or before\r\nthe 15th of that month; that your people feel they have a common destiny\r\nwith our people, and expect to form with them in that Convention a new\r\nConfederacy and Provisional Government; that you must and _will_ share\r\nour fortunes, suffering with us the evils of war, if it can not be\r\navoided, and enjoying with us the blessings of peace, if it _can_ be\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nI feel, gentlemen, the force of this appeal, and, so far as my authority\r\nextends, most cheerfully comply with your request.\r\n\r\nI am _not_ clothed with power to make the arrangements you suggest, but\r\nprovided you can get assurances, with which you are entirely satisfied,\r\nthat _no_ reënforcements will be sent to Fort Sumter in the interval,\r\nand that public peace shall _not_ be disturbed by any act of hostility\r\ntoward South Carolina, I will refer your communication to the\r\nauthorities of South Carolina, and, withholding their communication,\r\nwith which I am at present charged, will wait for their instructions.\r\n\r\nMajor Anderson and his command, let me assure you, _do_ now obtain all\r\nnecessary supplies of food (including fresh meat and vegetables), and, I\r\nbelieve, fuel and water; and _do_ now enjoy free communication, by post\r\nand special messengers, with the President, and will continue to do so,\r\ncertainly, until the door of negotiation shall be closed.\r\n\r\nIf your proposition is acceded to, you may assure the President that\r\n_no_ attack will be made on Fort Sumter until a response from the\r\nGovernor of South Carolina has been received by me, and communicated to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWith great consideration and profound esteem,\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\nISAAC W. HAYNE,\r\n_Envoy from the Governor and Council of South Carolina._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter of Senators of seceding States to the President._\r\n\r\n\r\nSenate-Chamber, _January 19, 1861_.\r\n\r\nSir: We have been requested to present to you copies of a correspondence\r\nbetween certain Senators of the United States and Colonel Isaac W.\r\nHayne, now in this city, in behalf of the government of South Carolina,\r\nand to ask that you will take into consideration the subject of said\r\ncorrespondence. Very respectfully, your obedient servants,\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN FITZPATRICK,\r\nS. R. MALLORY,\r\nJOHN SLIDELL.\r\nTo his Excellency James Buchanan, _President United States_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the letter above, an evasive reply was returned on the 22d by the\r\nHon. Joseph Holt, Secretary of War _ad interim_, on behalf of the\r\nPresident, the material points of which are contained in the following\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to the proposition of Colonel Hayne, that \"no reënforcements\r\nwill be sent to Fort Sumter in the interval, and that the public peace\r\nwill not be disturbed by any act of hostility toward South Carolina,\" it\r\nis impossible for me to give you any such assurances. The President has\r\nno authority to enter into such an agreement or understanding. As an\r\nexecutive officer, he is simply bound to protect the public property, so\r\nfar as this may be practicable; and it would be a manifest violation of\r\nhis duty to place himself under engagements that he would not perform\r\nthis duty either for an indefinite or limited period. At the present\r\nmoment it is not deemed necessary to reënforce Major Anderson, because\r\nhe makes no such request, and feels quite secure in his position. Should\r\nhis safety, however, require reënforcements, every effort will be made\r\nto supply them.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Holt concludes his letter by saying:\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Anderson is not menacing Charleston; and I am convinced that the\r\nhappiest result which can be attained is, that both he and the\r\nauthorities of South Carolina shall remain on their present amicable\r\nfooting, neither party being bound by any obligations whatever, except\r\nthe high Christian and moral duty to keep the peace, and to avoid all\r\ncauses of mutual irritation. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ. HOLT, _Secretary of War ad interim._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter of Senators of seceding States to Hon. I. W. Hayne._\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. Isaac W. Hayne. Washington, _January 23, 1861_.\r\n\r\nSir: In answer to your letter of the 17th inst. we have now to inform\r\nyou that, after communicating with the President, we have received a\r\nletter signed by the Secretary of War, and addressed to Messrs.\r\nFitzpatrick, Mallory, and Slidell, on the subject of our proposition,\r\nwhich letter we now inclose to you. Although its terms are not as\r\nsatisfactory as we could have desired, in relation to the ulterior\r\npurposes of the Executive, we have no hesitation in expressing our\r\nentire confidence that no reënforcements will be sent to Fort Sumter,\r\nnor will the public peace be disturbed within the period requisite for\r\nfull communication between yourself and your government; and we trust,\r\ntherefore, that you will feel justified in applying for further\r\ninstructions before delivering to the President any message with which\r\nyou may have been charged.\r\n\r\nWe take this occasion to renew the expression of an earnest hope that\r\nSouth Carolina will not deem it incompatible with her safety, dignity;\r\nor honor to refrain from initiating any hostilities against any power\r\nwhatsoever, or from taking any steps tending to produce collision, until\r\nour States, which are to share her fortunes, shall have an opportunity\r\nof joining their counsels with hers.\r\n\r\nWe are, with great respect, your obedient servants,\r\n\r\nLOUIS T. WIGFALL,\r\nD. L. YULEE,\r\nJ. P. BENJAMIN,\r\nA. IVERSON,\r\nJOHN HEMPHILL,\r\nJOHN SLIDELL,\r\nC. C. CLAY, Jr.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Some of the signatures to the former letter addressed to you are\r\nnot affixed to the foregoing communication, in consequence of the\r\ndeparture of several Senators, now on their way to their respective\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter of Hon. I. W. Hayne to Senators of seceding States._\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Honorable Louis T. Wigfall, D. L. Yulee, J. P. Benjamin, A.\r\nIverson, John Hemphill, John Slidell, and C. C. Clay, Jr.\r\n\r\nGentlemen: I have received your letter of the 23d inst., inclosing a\r\ncommunication dated the 22d inst., addressed to Messrs. Fitzpatrick,\r\nMallory, and Slidell, from the Secretary of War _ad interim_. This\r\ncommunication from the Secretary is far from being satisfactory to me.\r\nBut, inasmuch as you state that \"we (you) have no hesitation in\r\nexpressing an entire confidence that no reënforcement will be sent to\r\nFort Sumter, nor will the public peace be disturbed within the period\r\nrequisite for full communication between yourself (myself) and your (my)\r\nGovernment,\" in compliance with our previous understanding, I withhold\r\nthe communication with which I am at present charged, and refer the\r\nwhole matter to the authorities of South Carolina, and will await their\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nMr. Gourdin, of South Carolina, now in this city, will leave here by the\r\nevening's train, and will lay before the Governor of South Carolina and\r\nhis Council the whole correspondence between yourselves and myself, and\r\nbetween you and the Government of the United States, with a\r\ncommunication from me, asking further instructions.\r\n\r\nI can not, in closing, but express my deep regret that the President\r\nshould deem it necessary to keep a garrison of troops at Fort Sumter for\r\nthe protection of the \"_property_\" of the United States. South Carolina\r\nscorns the idea of appropriating to herself the _property_ of another,\r\nwhether of a government or an individual, without accounting, to the\r\nlast dollar, for everything which, for the protection of her citizens\r\nand in vindication of her own honor and dignity, she may deem it\r\nnecessary to take into her own possession. As _property_, Fort Sumter is\r\nin far greater jeopardy occupied by a garrison of United States troops\r\nthan it would be if delivered over to the State authorities, with the\r\npledge that, in regard to that and all other property claimed by the\r\nUnited States within the jurisdiction of South Carolina, they would\r\nfully account, upon a fair adjustment.\r\n\r\nUpon the other point of the preservation of the peace, and the avoidance\r\nof bloodshed--is it supposed that the occupation of a fort in the midst\r\nof a harbor, with guns bearing upon every position of it, by a\r\nGovernment no longer acknowledged, can be other than the occasion of\r\nconstant irritation, excitement, and indignation? It creates a condition\r\nof things which I fear is but little calculated to advance the\r\nobservance of the \"high Christian and moral duty to keep the peace, and\r\nto avoid all causes of mutual irritation,\" recommended by the Secretary\r\nof War in his communication.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment, to continue to hold Fort Sumter, by United States\r\ntroops, is the worst possible means of protecting it as property, and\r\nthe worst possible means for effecting a peaceful solution of present\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nI beg leave, in conclusion, to say that it is in deference to the\r\nunanimous opinion expressed by the Senators present in Washington,\r\n\"representing States which have already seceded from the United States,\r\nor will have done so before the 1st of February next,\" that I comply\r\nwith your suggestions. And I feel assured that suggestions from such a\r\nquarter will be considered with profound respect by the authorities of\r\nSouth Carolina, and will have great weight in determining their action.\r\n\r\nWith high consideration, I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your\r\nobedient servant,\r\n\r\nISAAC W. HAYNE,\r\n\r\n_Envoy from the Governor and Council of South Carolina._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Hayne to the President of the United States_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, _January_ 31, 1861.\r\n\r\nTo his Excellency James Buchanan, _President_.\r\n\r\nSir: I had the honor to hold a short interview with you on the 14th\r\ninst., informal and unofficial. Having previously been informed that you\r\ndesired that whatever was official should be, on both sides, conducted\r\nby written communications, I did not at that time present my\r\ncredentials, but verbally informed you that I bore a letter from the\r\nGovernor of South Carolina in regard to the occupation of Fort Sumter,\r\nwhich I would deliver the next day under cover of a written\r\ncommunication from myself. The next day, before such communication could\r\nbe made, I was waited upon by a Senator from Alabama, who stated that he\r\ncame on the part of all the Senators then in Washington from the States\r\nwhich had already seceded from the United States, or would certainly\r\nhave done so before the 1st day of February next. The Senator from\r\nAlabama urged that he and they were interested in the subject of my\r\nmission in almost an equal degree with the authorities of South\r\nCarolina. He said that hostilities commenced between South Carolina and\r\nyour Government would necessarily involve the States represented by\r\nthemselves in civil strife, and, fearing that the action of South\r\nCarolina might complicate the relations of your Government to the\r\nseceded and seceding States, and thereby interfere with a peaceful\r\nsolution of existing difficulties, these Senators requested that I would\r\nwithhold my message to yourself until a consultation among themselves\r\ncould be had. To this I agreed, and the result of the consultation was\r\nthe letter of these Senators addressed to me, dated 15th January, a copy\r\nof which is in your possession. To this letter I replied on the 17th,\r\nand a copy of that reply is likewise in your possession. This\r\ncorrespondence, as I am informed, was made the subject of a\r\ncommunication from Senators Fitzpatrick, Mallory, and Slidell, addressed\r\nto you, and your attention called to the contents. These gentlemen\r\nreceived on the 22d day of January a reply to their application,\r\nconveyed in a letter addressed to them, dated the 22d, signed by the\r\nHon. J. Holt, Secretary of War _ad interim_. Of this letter you of\r\ncourse have a copy. This letter from Mr. Holt was communicated to me\r\nunder the cover of a letter from all the Senators of the seceded and\r\nseceding States, who still remained in Washington; and of this letter,\r\ntoo, I am informed you have been furnished with a copy.\r\n\r\nThis reply of yours through the Secretary of War _ad interim_ to the\r\napplication made by the Senators, was entirely unsatisfactory to me. It\r\nappeared to me to be not only a rejection in advance of the main\r\nproposition made by these Senators, to wit, that \"an arrangement should\r\nbe agreed on between the authorities of South Carolina and your\r\nGovernment, at least until the 15th of February next, by which time\r\nSouth Carolina and the States represented by the Senators might, in\r\nconvention, devise a wise, just, and peaceable solution of existing\r\ndifficulties\"; \"in the mean time,\" they say, \"we think\" (that is, these\r\nSenators) \"that your State\" (South Carolina) \"should suffer Major\r\nAnderson to obtain necessary supplies of food, fuel, or water, and enjoy\r\nfree communication, by post or special messenger, with the President,\r\nupon the understanding that the President will not send him\r\nreënforcements during the same period\"; but, besides this rejection of\r\nthe main proposition, there was in Mr. Holt's letter a distinct refusal\r\nto make any stipulation on the subject of reënforcement, even for the\r\nshort time that might be required to communicate with my government.\r\n\r\nThis reply to the Senators was, as I have stated, altogether\r\nunsatisfactory to me, and I felt sure that it would be so to the\r\nauthorities whom I represented. It was not, however, addressed to me, or\r\nto the authorities of South Carolina; and, as South Carolina had\r\naddressed nothing to your Government, and had asked nothing at your\r\nhands, I looked not to Mr. Holt's letter but to the note addressed to me\r\nby the Senators of the seceded and seceding States. I had consented to\r\nwithhold my message at _their_ instance, provided they could get\r\nassurances _satisfactory to them_ that no reënforcements would be sent\r\nto Fort Sumter in the interval, and that the peace should not be\r\ndisturbed by any act of hostility. The Senators expressed, in their note\r\nto me of the 23d instant, their \"entire confidence that no\r\nreënforcements will be sent to Fort Sumter, nor will the public peace be\r\ndisturbed within the period requisite for full communication between you\r\n(myself) and your (my) Government\"; and renewed their request that I\r\nwould withhold the communication with which I stood charged, and await\r\nfurther instructions. This I have done. The further instructions arrived\r\non the 30th instant and bear date the 26th. I now have the honor to make\r\nto you my first communication as special envoy from the government of\r\nSouth Carolina. You will find inclosed the original communication to the\r\nPresident of the United States from the Governor of South Carolina, with\r\nwhich I was charged in Charleston on the 12th day of January, instant,\r\nthe day on which it bears date. I am now instructed by the Governor of\r\nSouth Carolina to say that \"his opinion as to the propriety of the\r\ndemand which is contained in this letter has not only been confirmed by\r\nthe circumstances which your (my) mission has developed, but is now\r\nincreased to a conviction of its necessity. The safety of the State\r\nrequires that the position of the President should be distinctly\r\nunderstood. The safety of all seceding States requires it as much as the\r\nsafety of South Carolina. If it be so, that Fort Sumter is held as\r\n_property_, then as property, the rights, whatever they may be, of the\r\nUnited States can be ascertained, and for the satisfaction of these\r\nrights the pledge of the State of South Carolina you are\" (I am)\r\n\"authorized to give. If Fort Sumter is not held as property, it is\r\nheld,\" say my instructions, \"as a military post, and such a post within\r\nthe limits of South Carolina can not be tolerated.\"\r\n\r\nYou will perceive that it is upon the presumption that it is solely as\r\nproperty that you continue to hold Fort Sumter that I have been selected\r\nfor the performance of the duty upon which I have entered. I do not come\r\nas a military man to demand the surrender of a fortress, but as the\r\nlegal officer of the State, its Attorney-General, to claim for the State\r\nthe exercise of its undoubted right of eminent domain, and to pledge the\r\nState to make good all injury to the rights of property which may arise\r\nfrom the exercise of the claim.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina, as a separate, independent sovereignty, assumes the\r\nright to take into her possession everything within her limits essential\r\nto maintain her honor or her safety, irrespective of the question of\r\nproperty, subject only to the moral duty requiring that compensation\r\nshould be made to the owner. This right she can not permit to be drawn\r\ninto discussion. As to compensation for any property, whether of an\r\nindividual or a Government, which she may deem it necessary for her\r\nhonor or safety to take into her possession, her past history gives\r\nample guarantee that it will be made, upon a fair accounting, to the\r\nlast dollar. The proposition now is, that her law officer should, under\r\nauthority of the Governor and his Council, distinctly pledge the faith\r\nof South Carolina to make such compensation in regard to Fort Sumter,\r\nand its appurtenances and contents, to the full extent of the money\r\nvalue of the property of the United States delivered over to the\r\nauthorities of South Carolina by your command.\r\n\r\nI will not suppose that a pledge like this can be considered\r\ninsufficient security. Is not the money value of the property of the\r\nUnited States in this fort, situated where it can not be made available\r\nto the United States for any one purpose for which it was originally\r\nconstructed, worth more to the United States than the property itself?\r\nWhy, then, _as property_, insist on holding it by an armed garrison? Yet\r\nsuch has been the ground upon which you have invariably placed your\r\noccupancy of this fort by troops; beginning, prospectively, with your\r\nannual message of the 4th December; again in your special message of the\r\n9th (8th) January, and still more emphatically in your message of the\r\n28th January. The same position is set forth in your reply to the\r\nSenators, through the Secretary of War _ad interim_. It is there\r\nvirtually conceded that Fort Sumter \"is held merely as property of the\r\nUnited States, which you deem it your duty, to protect and preserve.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, it is submitted that the continuance of an armed possession\r\nactually jeopards the property you desire to protect. It is impossible\r\nbut that such a possession, if continued long enough, must lead to\r\ncollision. No people, not completely abject and pusillanimous, could\r\nsubmit, indefinitely, to the armed occupation of a fortress in the midst\r\nof the harbor of its principal city, and commanding the ingress and\r\negress of every ship that enters the port, the daily ferry-boats that\r\nply upon the waters moving but at the sufferance of aliens. An attack\r\nupon this fort would scarcely improve it as property, whatever the\r\nresult; and, if captured, it would no longer be the subject of account.\r\n\r\nTo protect Fort Sumter, merely as property, it is submitted that an\r\narmed occupancy is not only unnecessary, but that it is manifestly the\r\nworst possible means which can be resorted to for such an object.\r\n\r\nYour reply to the Senators, through Mr. Holt, declares it to be your\r\nsole object \"to act strictly on the defensive, and to authorize no\r\nmovement against South Carolina unless justified by a hostile movement\r\non their part,\" yet, in reply to the proposition of the Senators that no\r\nreënforcements should be sent to Fort Sumter, provided South Carolina\r\nagrees that during the same period no attack should be made, you say:\r\n\"It is impossible for me (your Secretary) to give you (the Senators) any\r\nsuch assurance,\" that it \"would be a manifest violation of his (your)\r\nduty to place himself (yourself) under engagements that he (you) would\r\nnot perform the duty either for an indefinite or a limited period.\"\r\n\r\nIn your message of the 28th inst., in expressing yourself in regard to a\r\nsimilar proposition, you say: \"However strong may be my desire to enter\r\ninto such an agreement, I am convinced that I do not possess the power.\r\nCongress, and Congress alone, under the war-making power, can exercise\r\nthe discretion of agreeing to abstain 'from any and all acts calculated\r\nto produce a collision of arms' between this and other governments. It\r\nwould, therefore, be a usurpation for the Executive to attempt to\r\nrestrain their hands by an agreement in regard to matters over which he\r\nhas no constitutional control. If he were thus to act, they might pass\r\nlaws which he should be bound to obey, though in conflict with his\r\nagreement.\" The proposition, it is suggested, was addressed to you under\r\nthe laws as they now are, and was not intended to refer to a new\r\ncondition of things arising under new legislation. It was addressed to\r\nthe Executive discretion, acting under existing laws. If Congress\r\nshould, under the war-making power, or in any other way, legislate in a\r\nmanner to affect the peace of South Carolina, her interests or her\r\nrights, it would not be accomplished in secret. South Carolina would\r\nhave timely notice, and she would, I trust, endeavor to meet the\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nIt is added in the letter of Mr. Holt that \"at the present moment it is\r\nnot deemed necessary to reënforce Major Anderson, because he makes no\r\nsuch request, and feels quite secure in his position. But, should his\r\nsafety require it, every effort will be made to supply reënforcements.\"\r\nThis would seem to ignore the other branch of the proposition made by\r\nthe Senators, viz., that no attack was to be made on Fort Sumter during\r\nthe period suggested, and that Major Anderson should enjoy the\r\nfacilities of communication, etc.\r\n\r\nI advert to this point, however, for the purpose of saying that to send\r\nreënforcements to Fort Sumter could not serve as a means of _protecting_\r\nand _preserving_ property, for, as must be known to your Government, it\r\nwould inevitably lead to immediate hostilities, in which property on all\r\nsides would necessarily suffer.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina has every disposition to preserve the public peace, and\r\nfeels, I am sure, in full force, those high \"Christian and moral duties\"\r\nreferred to by your Secretary; and it is submitted that on her part\r\nthere is scarcely any consideration of mere property, apart from honor\r\nand safety, which could induce her to do aught to jeopard that peace,\r\nstill less to inaugurate a protracted and bloody civil war. She rests\r\nher position on something higher than mere property. It is a\r\nconsideration of her own dignity as a sovereign, and the safety of her\r\npeople, which prompts her to demand that this property should not longer\r\nbe used as a military post by a Government she no longer acknowledges.\r\nShe feels this to be an imperative duty. It has, in fact, become an\r\nabsolute necessity of her condition.\r\n\r\nRepudiating, as you do, the idea of coercion, avowing peaceful\r\nintentions, and expressing a patriot's horror for civil war and bloody\r\nstrife among those who once were brethren, it is hoped that on further\r\nconsideration you will not, on a mere question of property, refuse the\r\nreasonable demand of South Carolina, which honor and necessity alike\r\ncompel her to vindicate. Should you disappoint this hope, the\r\nresponsibility for the result surely does not rest with her. If the\r\nevils of war are to be encountered, especially the calamities of civil\r\nwar, an elevated statesmanship would seem to require that it should be\r\naccepted as the unavoidable alternative of something still more\r\ndisastrous, such as national dishonor or measures materially affecting\r\nthe safety or permanent interests of a people--that it should be a\r\nchoice deliberately made, and entered upon as war, and of set purpose.\r\nBut that war should be the incident or accident, attendant on a policy\r\nprofessedly peaceful, and not required to effect the object which is\r\navowed as the only end intended, can only be excused when there has been\r\nno warning given as to the consequences.\r\n\r\nI am further instructed to say that South Carolina can not, by her\r\nsilence, appear to acquiesce in the imputation that she was guilty of an\r\nact of unprovoked aggression in firing on the Star of the West. Though\r\nan unarmed vessel, she was filled with armed men entering her territory\r\nagainst her will, with the purpose of reënforcing a garrison held,\r\nwithin her limits, against her protest. She forbears to recriminate by\r\ndiscussing the question of the propriety of attempting such a\r\nreënforcement at all, as well as of the disguised and secret manner in\r\nwhich it was intended to be effected. And on this occasion she will say\r\nnothing as to the manner in which Fort Sumter was taken into the\r\npossession of its present occupants.\r\n\r\nThe interposition of the Senators who have addressed you was a\r\ncircumstance unexpected by my government, and unsolicited certainly by\r\nme. The Governor, while he appreciates the high and generous motives by\r\nwhich they were prompted, and while he fully approves the delay which,\r\nin deference to them, has taken place in the presentation of this\r\ndemand, feels that it can not longer be withheld.\r\n\r\nI conclude with an extract from the instructions just received by me\r\nfrom the government of South Carolina:\r\n\r\n\"The letter of the President, through Mr. Holt, may be received as the\r\nreply to the question you were instructed to ask, as to his assertion of\r\nhis right to send reënforcements to Fort Sumter. You were instructed to\r\nsay to him, if he asserted that right, that the State of South Carolina\r\nregarded such a right when asserted, or with an attempt at its exercise,\r\nas a declaration of war.\r\n\r\n\"If the President intends it shall not be so understood, it is proper,\r\nto avoid any misconception hereafter, that he should be informed of the\r\nmanner in which the Governor will feel bound to regard it.\r\n\r\n\"If the President, when you have stated the reasons which prompt the\r\nGovernor in making the demand for the delivery of Sumter, shall refuse\r\nto deliver the fort upon the pledge you have been authorized to make,\r\nyou will communicate that refusal without delay to the Governor. If the\r\nPresident shall not be prepared to give you an immediate answer, you\r\nwill communicate to him that his answer may be transmitted within a\r\nreasonable time to the Governor at this place (Charleston, South\r\nCarolina).\r\n\r\n\"The Governor does not consider it necessary that you (I) should remain\r\nlonger in Washington than is necessary to execute this, the closing duty\r\nof your (my) mission, in the manner now indicated to you (me). As soon\r\nas the Governor shall receive from you information that you have closed\r\nyour mission, and the reply, whatever it may be, of the President, he\r\nwill consider the conduct which may be necessary on his part.\"\r\n\r\nAllow me to request that you would, as soon as possible, inform me\r\nwhether, under these instructions, I need await your answer in\r\nWashington; and, if not, I would be pleased to convey from you, to my\r\ngovernment, information as to the time when an answer may be expected in\r\nCharleston.\r\n\r\nWith high consideration,\r\n\r\nI am, very respectfully,\r\n\r\nISAAC W. HAYNE, _Special Envoy_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome further correspondence ensued, but without the presentation of any\r\nnew feature necessary to a full understanding of the case. The result\r\nwas to leave it as much unsettled in the end as it had been in the\r\nbeginning, and the efforts at negotiation were terminated by the\r\nretirement from Washington of Colonel Hayne on the 8th of February,\r\n1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX K.\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States, adopted on the\r\n8th of February, 1861, is here presented, followed by the Constitution\r\nof the United States, with all its amendments to the period of the\r\nsecession of the Southern States, and the permanent Constitution of the\r\nConfederate States (adopted on the 11th of March, 1861), in parallel\r\ncolumns.

SECRETARY\r\nSEWARD AND JUDGE CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Commissioners to Mr. Seward._\r\n\r\nWashington City, _March 12, 1861_.\r\n\r\nHon. William H. Seward, _Secretary of State of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSir: The undersigned have been duly accredited by the Government of the\r\nConfederate States of America as commissioners to the Government of the\r\nUnited States, and, in pursuance of their instructions, have now the\r\nhonor to acquaint you with that fact, and to make known, through you to\r\nthe President of the United States, the objects of their presence in\r\nthis capital.\r\n\r\nSeven states of the late Federal Union, having in the exercise of the\r\ninherent right of every free people to change or reform their political\r\ninstitutions, and through conventions of their people, withdrawn from\r\nthe United States and reassumed the attributes of sovereign power\r\ndelegated to it, have formed a government of their own. The Confederate\r\nStates constitute an independent nation, _de facto_ and _de jure_, and\r\npossess a government perfect in all its parts, and endowed with all the\r\nmeans of self-support.\r\n\r\nWith a view to a speedy adjustment of all questions growing out of this\r\npolitical separation, upon such terms of amity and good-will as the\r\nrespective interests, geographical contiguity, and future welfare of the\r\ntwo nations may render necessary, the undersigned are instructed to make\r\nto the Government of the United States overtures for the opening of\r\nnegotiations, assuring the Government of the United States, that the\r\nPresident, Congress, and people of the Confederate States earnestly\r\ndesire a peaceful solution of these great questions; that it is neither\r\ntheir interest nor their wish to make any demand which is not founded in\r\nstrictest justice, nor do any act to injure their late confederates.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned have now the honor, in obedience to the instructions of\r\ntheir Government, to request you to appoint as early a day as possible,\r\nin order that they may present to the President of the United States the\r\ncredentials which they bear and the objects of the mission with which\r\nthey are charged.\r\n\r\nWe are, very respectfully, your obedient servants,\r\n\r\n(Signed)  JOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n(Signed)  MARTIN J. CRAWFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum._\r\n\r\nDepartment of State, Washington, _March_ 15, 1861.\r\n\r\nMr. John Forsyth, of the State of Alabama, and Mr. Martin J. Crawford,\r\nof the State of Georgia, on the 11th inst., through the kind offices of\r\na distinguished Senator, submitted to the Secretary of State their\r\ndesire for an unofficial interview. This request was, on the 12th inst.,\r\nupon exclusively public considerations, respectfully declined.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th inst., while the Secretary was preoccupied, Mr. A. D. Banks,\r\nof Virginia, called at this department, and was received by the\r\nAssistant Secretary, to whom he delivered a sealed communication, which\r\nhe had been charged by Messrs. Forsyth and Crawford to present to the\r\nSecretary in person.\r\n\r\nIn that communication Messrs. Forsyth and Crawford inform the Secretary\r\nof State that they have been duly accredited by the Government of the\r\nConfederate States of America as commissioners to the Government of the\r\nUnited States, and they set forth the objects of their attendance at\r\nWashington. They observe that seven States of the American Union, in the\r\nexercise of a right inherent in every free people, have withdrawn,\r\nthrough conventions of their people, from the United States, reassumed\r\nthe attributes of sovereign power, and formed a government of their own,\r\nand that those Confederate States now constitute an independent nation,\r\n_de facto_ and _de jure_, and possess a government perfect in all its\r\nparts, and fully endowed with all the means of self-support.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Forsyth and Crawford, in their aforesaid communication,\r\nthereupon proceeded to inform the Secretary that, with a view to a\r\nspeedy adjustment of all questions growing out of the political\r\nseparation thus assumed, upon such terms of amity and good-will as the\r\nrespective interests, geographical contiguity, and the future welfare of\r\nthe supposed two nations might render necessary, they are instructed to\r\nmake to the Government of the United States overtures for the opening of\r\nnegotiations, assuring this Government that the President, Congress, and\r\nthe people of the Confederate States earnestly desire a peaceful\r\nsolution of these great questions, and that it is neither their interest\r\nnor their wish to make any demand which is not founded in the strictest\r\njustice, nor do any act to injure their late confederates.\r\n\r\nAfter making these statements, Messrs. Forsyth and Crawford close their\r\ncommunication, as they say, in obedience to the instructions of their\r\nGovernment, by requesting the Secretary of State to appoint as early a\r\nday as possible, in order that they may present to the President of the\r\nUnited States the credentials which they bear and the objects of the\r\nmission with which they are charged.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State frankly confesses that he understands the events\r\nwhich have recently occurred, and the condition of political affairs\r\nwhich actually exists in the part of the Union to which his attention\r\nhas thus been directed, very differently from the aspect in which they\r\nare presented by Messrs. Forsyth and Crawford. He sees in them, not a\r\nrightful and accomplished revolution and an independent nation, with an\r\nestablished Government, but rather a perversion of a temporary and\r\npartisan excitement to the inconsiderate purposes of an unjustifiable\r\nand unconstitutional aggression upon the rights and the authority vested\r\nin the Federal Government, and hitherto benignly exercised, as from\r\ntheir very nature they always must so be exercised, for the maintenance\r\nof the Union, the preservation of liberty, and the security, peace,\r\nwelfare, happiness, and aggrandizement of the American people. The\r\nSecretary of State, therefore, avows to Messrs. Forsyth and Crawford\r\nthat he looks patiently, but confidently, for the cure of evils which\r\nhave resulted from proceedings so unnecessary, so unwise, so unusual,\r\nand so unnatural, not to irregular negotiations, having in view new and\r\nuntried relations with agencies unknown to and acting in derogation of\r\nthe Constitution and laws, but to regular and considerate action of the\r\npeople of those States, in coöperation with their brethren in the other\r\nStates, through the Congress of the United States, and such\r\nextraordinary conventions, if there shall be need thereof, as the\r\nFederal Constitution contemplates and authorizes to be assembled.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the purpose of the Secretary of State, on this occasion,\r\nnot to invite or engage in any discussion of these subjects, but simply\r\nto set forth his reasons for declining to comply with the request of\r\nMessrs. Forsyth and Crawford.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March instant, the then newly elected President of the\r\nUnited States, in view of all the facts bearing on the present question,\r\nassumed the Executive Administration of the Government, first\r\ndelivering, in accordance with an early, honored custom, an inaugural\r\naddress to the people of the United States. The Secretary of State\r\nrespectfully submits a copy of this address to Messrs. Forsyth and\r\nCrawford.\r\n\r\nA simple reference to it will be sufficient to satisfy these gentlemen\r\nthat the Secretary of State, guided by the principles therein announced,\r\nis prevented altogether from admitting or assuming that the States\r\nreferred to by them have, in law or in fact, withdrawn from the Federal\r\nUnion, or that they could do so in the manner described by Messrs.\r\nForsyth and Crawford, or in any other manner than with the consent and\r\nconcert of the people of the United States, to be given through a\r\nNational Convention, to be assembled in conformity with the provisions\r\nof the Constitution of the United States. Of course, the Secretary of\r\nState can not act upon the assumption, or in any way admit that the\r\nso-called Confederate States constitute a foreign power, with whom\r\ndiplomatic relations ought to be established.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the Secretary of State, whose official duties\r\nare confined, subject to the direction of the President, to the\r\nconducting of the foreign relations of the country, and do not at all\r\nembrace domestic questions, or questions arising between the several\r\nStates and the Federal Government, is unable to comply with the request\r\nof Messrs. Forsyth and Crawford, to appoint a day on which they may\r\npresent the evidences of their authority and the objects of their visit\r\nto the President of the United States. On the contrary, he is obliged to\r\nstate to Messrs. Forsyth and Crawford that he has no authority, nor is\r\nhe at liberty, to recognize them as diplomatic agents, or hold\r\ncorrespondence or other communication with them.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Secretary of State would observe that, although he has\r\nsupposed that he might safely and with propriety have adopted these\r\nconclusions, without making any reference of the subject to the\r\nExecutive, yet, so strong has been his desire to practice entire\r\ndirectness, and to act in a spirit of perfect respect and candor toward\r\nMessrs. Forsyth and Crawford, and that portion of the people of the\r\nUnion in whose name they present themselves before him, that he has\r\ncheerfully submitted this paper to the President, who coincides\r\ngenerally in the views it expresses, and sanctions the Secretary's\r\ndecision declining official intercourse with Messrs. Forsyth and\r\nCrawford.\r\n\r\n_April 8, 1861._\r\n\r\nThe foregoing memorandum was filed in this department on the 15th of\r\nMarch last. A delivery of the same to Messrs. Forsyth and Crawford was\r\ndelayed, as was understood, with their consent. They have now, through\r\ntheir secretary, communicated their desire for a definite disposition of\r\nthe subject. The Secretary of State therefore directs that a duly\r\nverified copy of the paper be now delivered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Commissioners in reply to Mr. Seward._\r\n\r\nWashington, _April 9, 1861._\r\n\r\nHon. William H. Seward, _Secretary of State for the United States,\r\nWashington:_\r\n\r\nThe \"memorandum\" dated Department of State, Washington, March 15, 1861,\r\nwith postscript under date of 8th instant, has been received through the\r\nhands of Mr. J. T. Pickett, secretary of this commission, who, by the\r\ninstructions of the undersigned, called for it on yesterday at the\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nIn that memorandum you correctly state the purport of the official note\r\naddressed to you by the undersigned on the 12th ultimo. Without\r\nrepeating the contents of that note in full, it is enough to say here\r\nthat its object was to invite the Government of the United States to a\r\nfriendly consideration of the relations between the United States and\r\nthe seven States lately the Federal Union, but now separated from it by\r\nthe sovereign will of their people, growing out of the pregnant and\r\nundeniable fact that those people have rejected the authority of the\r\nUnited States, and established a government of their own. Those\r\nrelations had to be friendly or hostile. The people of the old and new\r\nGovernments, occupying contiguous territories, had to stand to each\r\nother in the relation of good neighbors, each seeking their happiness\r\nand pursuing their national destinies in their own way, without\r\ninterference with the other; or they had to be rival and hostile\r\nnations. The Government of the Confederate States had no hesitation in\r\nelecting its choice in this alternative. Frankly and unreservedly,\r\nseeking the good of the people who had intrusted them with power, in the\r\nspirit of humanity, of the Christian civilization of the age, and of\r\nthat Americanism which regards the true welfare and happiness of the\r\npeople, the Government of the Confederate States, among its first acts,\r\ncommissioned the undersigned to approach the Government of the United\r\nStates with the olive-branch of peace, and to offer to adjust the great\r\nquestions pending between them in the only way to be justified by the\r\nconsciences and common sense of good men who had nothing but the welfare\r\nof the people of the two confederacies at heart.\r\n\r\nYour Government has not chosen to meet the undersigned in the\r\nconciliatory and peaceful spirit in which they are commissioned.\r\nPersistently wedded to those fatal theories of construction of the\r\nFederal Constitution always rejected by the statesmen of the South, and\r\nadhered to by those of the Administration school, until they have\r\nproduced their natural and often predicted result of the destruction of\r\nthe Union, under which we might have continued to live happily and\r\ngloriously together, had the spirit of the ancestry who framed the\r\ncommon Constitution animated the hearts of all their sons, you now, with\r\na persistence untaught and uncured by the ruin which has been wrought,\r\nrefuse to recognize the great fact presented to you of a completed and\r\nsuccessful revolution; you close your eyes to the existence of the\r\nGovernment founded upon it, and ignore the high duties of moderation and\r\nhumanity which attach to you in dealing with this great fact. Had you\r\nmet these issues with the frankness and manliness with which the\r\nundersigned were instructed to present them to you and treat them, the\r\nundersigned had not now the melancholy duty to return home and tell\r\ntheir Government and their countrymen that their earnest and ceaseless\r\nefforts in behalf of peace had been futile, and that the Government of\r\nthe United States meant to subjugate them by force of arms. Whatever may\r\nbe the result, impartial history will record the innocence of the\r\nGovernment of the Confederate States, and place the responsibility of\r\nthe blood and mourning that may ensue upon those who have denied the\r\ngreat fundamental doctrine of American liberty, that \"governments derive\r\ntheir just powers from the consent of the governed,\" and who have set\r\nnaval and land armaments in motion to subject the people of one portion\r\nof this land to the will of another portion. That that can never be\r\ndone, while a free-*man survives in the Confederate States to wield a\r\nweapon, the undersigned appeal to past history to prove. These military\r\ndemonstrations against the people of the seceded States are certainly\r\nfar from being in keeping and consistency with the theory of the\r\nSecretary of State, maintained in his memorandum, that these States are\r\nstill component parts of the late American Union, as the undersigned are\r\nnot aware of any constitutional power in the President of the United\r\nStates to levy war, without the consent of Congress, upon a foreign\r\npeople, much less upon any portion of the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, like the Secretary of State, have no purpose to \"invite\r\nor engage in discussion\" of the subject on which their two Governments\r\nare so irreconcilably at variance. It is this variance that has broken\r\nup the old Union, the disintegration of which has only begun. It is\r\nproper, however, to advise you that it were well to dismiss the hopes\r\nyou seem to entertain that, by any of the modes indicated, the people of\r\nthe Confederate States will ever be brought to submit to the authority\r\nof the Government of the United States. You are dealing with delusions,\r\ntoo, when you seek to separate our people from our Government, and to\r\ncharacterize the deliberate sovereign act of that people as a\r\n\"perversion of a temporary and partisan excitement\" If you cherish these\r\ndreams, you will be awakened from them and find them as unreal and\r\nunsubstantial as others in which you have recently indulged. The\r\nundersigned would omit the performance of an obvious duty, were they to\r\nfail to make known to the Government of the United States that the\r\npeople of the Confederate States have declared their independence with a\r\nfull knowledge of all the responsibilities of that act, and with as firm\r\na determination to maintain it by all the means with which nature has\r\nendowed them as that which sustained their fathers when they threw off\r\nthe authority of the British Crown.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned clearly understand that you have declined to appoint a\r\nday to enable them to lay the objects of the mission with which they are\r\ncharged before the President of the United States, because so to do\r\nwould be to recognize the independence and separate nationality of the\r\nConfederate States. This is the vein of thought that pervades the\r\nmemorandum before us. The truth of history requires that it should\r\ndistinctly appear upon the record that the undersigned did not ask the\r\nGovernment of the United States to recognize the independence of the\r\nConfederate States. They only asked audience to adjust, in a spirit of\r\namity and peace, the new relations springing from a manifest and\r\naccomplished revolution in the Government of the late Federal Union.\r\nYour refusal to entertain these overtures for a peaceful solution, the\r\nactive naval and military preparations of this Government, and a formal\r\nnotice to the commanding General of the Confederate forces in the harbor\r\nof Charleston that the President intends to provision Fort Sumter by\r\nforcible means, if necessary, are viewed by the undersigned, and can\r\nonly be received by the world, as a declaration of war against the\r\nConfederate States; for the President of the United States knows that\r\nFort Sumter can not be provisioned without the effusion of blood. The\r\nundersigned, in behalf of their Government and people, accept the gage\r\nof battle thus thrown down to them; and, appealing to God and the\r\njudgment of mankind for the righteousness of their cause, the people of\r\nthe Confederate States will defend their liberties to the last, against\r\nthis flagrant and open attempt at their subjugation to sectional power.\r\n\r\nThis communication can not be properly closed without adverting to the\r\ndate of your memorandum. The official note of the undersigned, of the\r\n12th of March, was delivered to the Assistant Secretary of State on the\r\n13th of that month, the gentleman who delivered it informing him that\r\nthe secretary of this commission would call at twelve o'clock, noon, on\r\nthe next day, for an answer. At the appointed hour Mr. Pickett did call,\r\nand was informed by the Assistant Secretary of State that the\r\nengagements of the Secretary of State had prevented him from giving the\r\nnote his attention. The Assistant Secretary of State then asked for the\r\naddress of Messrs. Crawford and Forsyth, the members of the commission\r\nthen present in this city, took note of the address on a card, and\r\nengaged to send whatever reply might be made to their lodgings. Why this\r\nwas not done, it is proper should be here explained. The memorandum is\r\ndated March 15th, and was not delivered until April 8th. Why was it\r\nwithheld during the intervening twenty-three days? In the postscript to\r\nyour memorandum you say it \"was delayed, as was understood, with their\r\n(Messrs. Forsyth and Crawford's) consent.\" This is true; but it is also\r\ntrue that, on the 15th of March, Messrs. Forsyth and Crawford were\r\nassured by a person occupying a high official position in the\r\nGovernment, and who, as they believed, was speaking by authority, that\r\nFort Sumter would be evacuated in a very few days, and that no measure\r\nchanging the existing _status_ prejudicially to the Confederate States,\r\nas respects Fort Pickens, was then contemplated, and these assurances\r\nwere subsequently repeated, with the addition that any contemplated\r\nchange as respects Pickens would be notified to us. On the 1st of April\r\nwe were again informed that there might be an attempt to supply Fort\r\nSumter with provisions, but that Governor Pickens should have previous\r\nnotice of this attempt. There was no suggestion of any reinforcement.\r\nThe undersigned did not hesitate to believe that these assurances\r\nexpressed the intentions of the Administration at the time, or at all\r\nevents of prominent members of that Administration. This delay was\r\nassented to for the express purpose of attaining the great end of the\r\nmission of the undersigned, to wit, a pacific solution of existing\r\ncomplications. The inference deducible from the date of your memorandum,\r\nthat the undersigned had, of their own volition and without cause,\r\nconsented to this long _hiatus_ in the grave duties with which they were\r\ncharged, is therefore not consistent with a just exposition of the facts\r\nof the case. The intervening twenty-three days were employed in active\r\nunofficial efforts, the object of which was to smooth the path to a\r\npacific solution, the distinguished personage alluded to coöperating\r\nwith the undersigned; and every step of that effort is recorded in\r\nwriting and now in the possession of the undersigned and of their\r\nGovernment. It was only when all those anxious efforts for peace had\r\nbeen exhausted, and it became clear that Mr. Lincoln had determined to\r\nappeal to the sword to reduce the people of the Confederate States to\r\nthe will of the section or party whose President he is, that the\r\nundersigned resumed the official negotiation temporarily suspended, and\r\nsent their secretary for a reply to their official note of March 12th.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to add that, during these twenty-three days, two gentlemen,\r\nof official distinction as high as that of the personage hitherto\r\nalluded to, aided the undersigned as intermediaries in these unofficial\r\nnegotiations for peace.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, commissioners of the Confederate States of America,\r\nhaving thus made answer to all they deem material in the memorandum\r\nfiled in the department on the 15th of March last, have the honor to be\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH,\r\nMARTIN J. CRAWFORD,\r\nA. B. ROMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward in reply to the Commissioners._\r\n\r\nDepartment Of State, Washington, _April 10, 1861._\r\n\r\nMessrs. Forsyth, Crawford, and Roman, having been apprised by a\r\nmemorandum, which has been delivered to them, that the Secretary of\r\nState is not at liberty to hold official intercourse with them, will, it\r\nis presumed, expect no notice from him of the new communication which\r\nthey have addressed to him under date of the 9th inst., beyond the\r\nsimple acknowledgment of the receipt thereof, which he hereby very\r\ncheerfully gives.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Judge Campbell to Mr. Seward._\r\n\r\nWashington City, _Saturday, April 18, 1861._\r\n\r\nSir: On the 15th of March, ultimo, I left with Judge Crawford, one of\r\nthe commissioners of the Confederate States, a note in writing, to the\r\neffect following:\r\n\r\n\"I feel entire confidence that Fort Sumter will be evacuated in the next\r\nten days. And this measure is felt as imposing great responsibility on\r\nthe Administration.\r\n\r\n\"I feel entire confidence that no measure changing the existing _status_\r\nprejudicially to the Southern Confederate States is at present\r\ncontemplated.\r\n\r\n\"I feel an entire confidence that an immediate demand for an answer to\r\nthe communication of the commissioners will be productive of evil and\r\nnot of good. I do not believe that it ought, at this time, to be\r\npressed.\"\r\n\r\nThe substance of this statement I communicated to you the same evening\r\nby letter. Five days elapsed, and I called with a telegram from General\r\nBeauregard, to the effect that Sumter was not evacuated, but that Major\r\nAnderson was at work making repairs.\r\n\r\nThe next day, after conversing with you, I communicated to Judge\r\nCrawford in writing that the failure to evacuate Sumter was not the\r\nresult of bad faith, but was attributable to causes consistent with the\r\nintention to fulfill the engagement, and that, as regarded Pickens, I\r\nshould have notice of any design to alter the existing _status_ there.\r\nMr. Justice Nelson was present at these conversations, three in number,\r\nand I submitted to him each of my written communications to Judge\r\nCrawford, and informed Judge Crawford that they had his (Judge Nelson's)\r\nsanction. I gave you, on the 22d of March, a substantial copy of the\r\nstatement I had made on the 15th.\r\n\r\nThe 30th of March arrived, and at that time a telegram came from\r\nGovernor Pickens, inquiring concerning Colonel Lamon, whose visit to\r\nCharleston he supposed had a connection with the proposed evacuation of\r\nFort Sumter. I left that with you, and was to have an answer the\r\nfollowing Monday (1st of April). On the 1st of April I received from you\r\nthe statement in writing, \"I am satisfied the Government will not\r\nundertake to supply Fort Sumter without giving notice to Governor P.\"\r\nThe words \"I am satisfied\" were for me to use as expressive of\r\nconfidence in the remainder of the declaration.\r\n\r\nThe proposition, as originally prepared, was, \"The President _may\r\ndesire_ to supply Sumter, but will not do so,\" etc., and your verbal\r\nexplanation was, that you did not believe any such attempt would be\r\nmade, and that there was no design to reënforce Sumter.\r\n\r\nThere was a departure here from the pledges of the previous month, but,\r\nwith the verbal explanation, I did not consider it a matter then to\r\ncomplain of. I simply stated to you that I had that assurance\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of April I addressed you a letter on the subject of the alarm\r\nthat the preparations by the Government had created, and asked you if\r\nthe assurances I had given were well or ill-founded. In respect to\r\nSumter, your reply was, \"Faith as to Sumter fully kept--wait and see.\"\r\nIn the morning's paper I read, \"An authorized messenger from President\r\nLincoln informed Governor Pickens and General Beauregard that provisions\r\nwill be sent to Fort Sumter--peaceably, or _otherwise by force_.\" This\r\nwas the 8th of April, at Charleston, the day following your last\r\nassurance, and is the last evidence of the full faith I was invited to\r\n_wait for_ and _see_. In the same paper I read that intercepted\r\ndispatches disclosed the fact that Mr. Fox, who had been allowed to\r\nvisit Major Anderson, on the pledge that his purpose was pacific,\r\nemployed his opportunity to devise a plan for supplying the fort by\r\nforce, and that this plan had been adopted by the Washington Government,\r\nand was in process of execution. My recollection of the date of Mr.\r\nFox's visit carries it to a day in March. I learn he is a near\r\nconnection of a member of the Cabinet. My connection with the\r\ncommissioners and yourself was superinduced by a conversation with\r\nJustice Nelson. He informed me of your strong disposition in favor of\r\npeace, and that you were oppressed with a demand of the commissioners of\r\nthe Confederate States for a reply to their first letter, and that you\r\ndesired to avoid it, if possible, at that time.\r\n\r\nI told him I might perhaps be of some service in arranging the\r\ndifficulty. I came to your office entirely at his request, and without\r\nthe knowledge of either of the commissioners. Your depression was\r\nobvious to both Judge Nelson and myself. I was gratified at the\r\ncharacter of the counsels you were desirous of pursuing, and much\r\nimpressed with your observation that a civil war might be prevented by\r\nthe success of my mediation. You read a letter of Mr. Weed, to show how\r\nirksome and responsible the withdrawal of troops from Sumter was. A\r\nportion of my communication to Judge Crawford, on the 16th of March, was\r\nfounded upon these remarks, and the pledge to evacuate Sumter is less\r\nforcible than the words you employed. These words were, \"Before this\r\nletter reaches you [a proposed letter by me to President Davis], Sumter\r\nwill have been evacuated.\" The commissioners who received those\r\ncommunications conclude they have been abused and overreached. The\r\nMontgomery Government hold the same opinion. The commissioners have\r\nsupposed that my communications were with you, and upon the [that]\r\nhypothesis were prepared to arraign you before the country, in\r\nconnection with the President. I placed a peremptory prohibition upon\r\nthis, as being contrary to the terms of my communications with them. I\r\npledged myself to them to communicate information, upon what I\r\nconsidered as the best authority, and they were to confide in the\r\nability of myself, aided by Judge Nelson, to determine upon the\r\ncredibility of my informant.\r\n\r\nI think no candid man, who will read over what I have written, and\r\nconsiders for a moment what is going on at Sumter, but will agree that\r\nthe equivocating conduct of the Administration, as measured and\r\ninterpreted in connection with these promises, is the proximate cause of\r\nthe great calamity.\r\n\r\nI have a profound conviction that the telegrams of the 8th of April, of\r\nGeneral Beauregard, and of the 10th of April, of General Walker, the\r\nSecretary of War, can be referred to nothing else than their belief that\r\nthere has been systematic duplicity practiced on them through me. It is\r\nunder an impressive sense of the weight of this responsibility that I\r\nsubmit to you these things for your explanation.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n(Signed)  JOHN A. CAMPBELL,\r\n_Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, United States._\r\nHon. William H. Seward, _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Judge Campbell to Mr. Secretary Seward_.\r\n\r\nWashington, _April 20, 1861._\r\n\r\nSir: I inclose you a letter, corresponding very nearly with one I\r\naddressed to you one week ago (April 13th), to which I have not had any\r\nreply. The letter is simply one of inquiry in reference to facts\r\nconcerning which, I think, I am entitled to an explanation. I have not\r\nadopted any opinion in reference to them which may not be modified by\r\nexplanation; nor have I affirmed in that letter, nor do I in this, any\r\nconclusion of my own unfavorable to your integrity in the whole\r\ntransaction. All that I have said and mean to say is, that an\r\nexplanation is due from you to myself. I will not say what I shall do in\r\ncase this request is not complied with, but I am justified in saying\r\nthat I shall feel at liberty to place these letters before any person\r\nwho is entitled to ask an explanation of myself.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\nJOHN A. CAMPBELL,\r\n_Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, United States_.\r\nHon. William H. Seward, _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\nNo reply has been made to this letter, April 24, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX TO VOL.
