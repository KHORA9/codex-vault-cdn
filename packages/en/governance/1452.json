The book was intended\r\nas a means of reaching the British public with the deputation's message.\r\n\r\nThe method seemed sound enough -- it was quite similar in form\r\nto the successful deputation which had pleaded to keep Bechuanaland\r\n(modern Botswana) under direct Imperial control in 1895.\r\nBut circumstances were different in 1914 -- South Africa\r\nhad been granted self-government, and the First World War began\r\nshortly after the deputation's arrival in England and distracted all parties.\r\nThis latter event also influenced the final form of the book,\r\nas Plaatje played to the patriotic sentiment so strong in Britain at the time.\r\nFor all his appeals, Plaatje did not succeed:  the Act went on to become\r\none of the first steps toward the system of Apartheid.  For all that,\r\nthere is sometimes in defeat the seeds of victory -- these troubles\r\nunited black South Africans like nothing before, and Plaatje's successors,\r\nin the form of the ANC, finally succeeded in the early 1990's.\r\n\r\nThe Natives' Land Act of 1913, which forbade natives to buy or rent land,\r\nexcept in a few small reserves consisting largely of wasteland,\r\nwas finally overturned in 1991.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks should be given to Neil Parsons, for his advice on this subject,\r\nand for being so kind as to research and write the introduction that follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlan R. Light\r\n  July, 1998.\r\n Monroe, North Carolina (USA).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction, by Neil Parsons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Native Life in South Africa\" is one of the most remarkable books on Africa,\r\nby one of the continent's most remarkable writers.  It was written\r\nas a work of impassioned political propaganda, exposing the plight\r\nof black South Africans under the whites-only government of newly unified\r\nSouth Africa.  It focuses on the effects of the 1913 Natives' Land Act\r\nwhich introduced a uniform system of land segregation between the races.\r\nIt resulted, as Plaatje shows, in the immediate expulsion of blacks,\r\nas \"squatters\", from their ancestral lands in the Orange Free State\r\nnow declared \"white\".  But Native Life succeeds in being\r\nmuch more than a work of propaganda.  It is a vital social document\r\nwhich captures the spirit of an age and shows the effects of rural segregation\r\non the everyday life of people.\r\n\r\nSolomon Tshekeisho Plaatje was born in 1878 in the lands of\r\nthe Tswana-speaking people, south of Mafeking.  His origins\r\nwere ordinary enough.  What was remarkable was the aptitude he showed\r\nfor education and learning after a few years schooling under the tuition\r\nof a remarkable liberal German Lutheran missionary, the Rev. Ludorf.\r\nAt the age of sixteen Plaatje (using the Dutch nickname of his grandfather\r\nas a surname) joined the Post Office as a mail-carrier in Kimberley,\r\nthe diamond city in the north of Cape Colony.  He subsequently passed\r\nthe highest clerical examination in the colony, beating every white candidate\r\nin both Dutch and typing.\r\n\r\nFrom Kimberley the young Plaatje went on to Mafeking, where he was\r\none of the key players in the great siege of 1899-1900.\r\nAs magistrate's interpreter he was the vital link between\r\nthe British civil authorities and the African majority\r\nbeleaguered inside the town's military perimeter.  Plaatje's diaries\r\nfrom this period, published long after his death, are a remarkable record\r\nboth of the siege and of his early prose experimentation --\r\nmixing languages and idioms, and full of bright humour.\r\n\r\nAfter the war Plaatje became a journalist, editor first\r\nof one Tswana language newspaper at Mafeking and then of another at Kimberley.\r\nLike other educated Africans he came out of the war optimistic that\r\nthe British would enfranchise all educated and propertied males\r\nin the defeated Boer colonies (Transvaal and Orange Free State)\r\nwithout regard to race.  But in this he, and the others,\r\nwere soon sorely disappointed.  The British gave a whites-only franchise\r\nto the defeated Boers and thus conceded power to a Boer or white Afrikaner\r\nparliamentary majority in the 1910 Union of South Africa\r\nwhich brought together the two Boer colonies with Cape Colony and Natal.\r\nClinging to the old but diminished \"colour blind\" franchise of the Cape,\r\nPlaatje remained one of the few Africans in South Africa\r\nwith a parliamentary vote.\r\n\r\nPlaatje's aggravation with the British government can be seen\r\nin an unpublished manuscript of 1908-09 titled \"Sekgoma -- the Black Dreyfus\".\r\nIn this booklet he castigated the British for denying legal rights\r\n(specifically habeas corpus) to their African subjects\r\noutside the Cape Colony.\r\n\r\nPlaatje became politically active in the \"native congress\" movement\r\nwhich represented the interests of educated and propertied Africans\r\nall over South Africa.  He was the first secretary-general\r\nof the \"South African Native National Congress\", founded in 1912\r\n(which renamed itself as the African National Congress or ANC\r\nten years later).\r\n\r\nThe first piece of major legislation presented to the whites-only\r\nparliament of South Africa was the Natives' Land Act, eventually passed\r\nin 1913, which was designed to entrench white power and property rights\r\nin the countryside -- as well as to solve the \"native problem\" of\r\nAfrican peasant farmers working for themselves and denying their labour power\r\nto white employers.\r\n\r\nThe main battle ground for the implementation of the new legislation\r\nwas the Orange Free State.  White farmers took the cue from the Land Act\r\nto begin expelling black peasants from their land as \"squatters\",\r\nwhile the police began to rigorously enforce the pass-laws\r\nwhich registered the employment of Africans and prescribed\r\ntheir residence and movement rights.\r\n\r\nThe Free State became the cockpit of resistance by the newly formed SANNC.\r\nIts womens' league demonstrated against pass law enforcement\r\nin Free State towns.  Its national executive sent a delegation to England,\r\nicluding Plaatje, who set sail in mid-1914.  The British crown retained\r\nultimate rights of sovereignty over the parliament and government\r\nof South Africa, with an as yet unexercised power of veto over\r\nSouth African legislation in the area of \"native affairs\".\r\n\r\nThe delegation received short shrift from the government in London which was,\r\nafter all, more than preoccupied with the coming of the Great War --\r\nin which it feared for the loyalty of the recently defeated Afrikaners\r\nand wished in no way to offend them.  But, rather than return empty-handed\r\nlike the rest of the SANNC delegation, Plaatje decided\r\nto stay in England to carry on the fight.  He was determined to recuit,\r\nthrough writing and lecturing, the liberal and humanitarian establishment\r\nto his side -- so that it in turn might pressure the British government.\r\n\r\nThus it was that Plaatje resumed work on a manuscript he had begun\r\non the ship to England.  \"Native Life in South Africa\".\r\nThe book was published in 1916 by P. S. King in London.\r\nIt was dedicated to Harriette Colenso, doughty woman camnpaigner\r\nwho had inherited from her father, Bishop Colenso, the mantle of advocate\r\nto the British establishment of the rights of the Zulu nation in South Africa.\r\n\r\nWhile in England Plaatje pursued his interests in language and linguistics\r\nby collaborating with Professor Daniel Jones of the University of London --\r\ninventor of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and prototype for\r\nProfessor Higgins in Shaw's \"Pygmalion\" and thus the musical \"My Fair Lady\".\r\nIn the same year as Native Life was published, 1916, Plaatje published\r\ntwo other shorter books which brought together the European languages\r\n(English, Dutch and German) he loved with the Tswana language.\r\n\"Sechuana Proverbs\" was a listing of Tswana proverbs with\r\ntheir European equivalents.  \"A Sechuana Reader\" was co-authored with Jones,\r\nusing the IPA for Tswana orthography.\r\n\r\nPlaatje returned to South Africa but went once again to England\r\nafter the war's end, to lead a second SANNC delegation keen to make its mark\r\non the peace negotiations in 1919.  This time Plaatje managed to get\r\nas far as the prime minister, Lloyd George, \"the Welsh wizard\".\r\nLloyd George was duly impressed with Plaatje and undertook\r\nto present his case to General Jan Smuts in the South African government,\r\na supposedly liberal fellow-traveller.  But Smuts, whose notions of liberalism\r\nwere patronizingly segregationist, fobbed off Lloyd George\r\nwith an ingenuous reply.\r\n\r\nDisillusioned with the flabby friendship of British liberals,\r\nPlaatje was increasingly drawn to the pan-Africanism of W. E. B. Du Bois,\r\npresident of the NAACP in the United States.  In 1921 Plaatje sailed\r\nfor the United States on a lecture tour that took him through\r\nhalf the country.  He paid his own way by publishing and selling\r\n18,000 copies of a booklet titled \"The Mote and the Beam:  an Epic\r\non Sex-Relationship 'twixt Black and White in British South Africa\"\r\nat 25 cents each.  In the following year, after Plaatje had left,\r\nthis new edition of \"Native Life in South Africa\" was published,\r\nby the NAACP newspaper \"The Crisis\" edited by Du Bois.\r\n\r\nPlaatje returned home to Kimberley to find the SANNC a spent force,\r\ndespite its name change to ANC, overtaken by more radical forces.\r\nAt a time when white power was pushing ahead with an ever more intense\r\nsegregationist programme, based on anti-black legislation,\r\nPlaatje became a lone voice for old black liberalism.  He turned from politics\r\nand devoted the rest of his life to literature.  His passion for Shakespeare\r\nresulted in mellifluous Tswana translations of five plays\r\nfrom \"Comedy of Errors\" to \"Merchant of Venice\" and \"Julius Caesar\".\r\nHis passion for the history of his people, and of his family in particular,\r\nresulted in a historical novel, \"Mhudi (An Epic of South African Native Life\r\na Hundred Years Ago)\", dedicated to his daughter Olive who had died\r\nin the influenza epidemic while Plaatje was overseas --\r\ndescribed in the dedication as \"one of the many victims of a settled system\".\r\n\r\n\"Mhudi\" was published by the missionary press at Lovedale in 1930,\r\nin a somewhat bowdlerized version.  It has since been republished\r\nin more pristine form and is today considered not just the first\r\nbut one of the very best novels published by a black South African writer\r\nin English.\r\n\r\nPlaatje lived an extraordinary life but died a largely disappointed man.\r\nHis feats of political journalism had been largely forgotten\r\nand his creative talents had hardly yet been recognised\r\n-- except in the confined world of Tswana language readership.\r\nBut today Plaatje is regarded as a South African literary pioneer,\r\nas a not insignificant political actor in his time,\r\nand as a cogent commentator on his times.  He was an explorer\r\nin a fascinating world of cultural and linguistic interaction,\r\nwho was in retrospect truly a \"renaissance man\".\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated Reading:\r\n\r\nSol T. Plaatje (ed.

The next puzzle was:  \"Which one?\"\r\nWe carefully examined each, but could not strike a happy decision\r\nuntil some one who entered the room happened to make use\r\nof the familiar phrase:  \"The long and the short of it\".\r\nThat phrase solved the difficulty for us, and we at once made up our mind\r\nto use two of these references, namely, the shortest and the longest.\r\nThe first one is from His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught,\r\nand the second takes the form of a leading article in the `Pretoria News'.\r\n\r\n==\r\n                         Central South African Railways,\r\n                                   High Commissioner's Train.\r\n\r\nOn February 1, 1906, Mr. Sol Plaatje acted as Interpreter\r\nwhen I visited the Barolong Native Stadt at Mafeking, and performed his duty\r\nto my entire satisfaction.\r\n\r\n                         (Signed)  Arthur.\r\nMafeking,\r\n  February 1, 1906.\r\n==\r\n\r\n==\r\nWe commence to-day an experiment which will prove a success\r\nif only we can persuade the more rabid negrophobes to adopt\r\na moderate and sensible attitude.  We publish the first of a series of letters\r\nfrom a native correspondent of considerable education and ability,\r\nhis name is Solomon Tshekisho Plaatje.  Mr. Plaatje was born\r\nin the district of Boshof, his parents being Barolongs,\r\ncoming originally from Thaba Ncho, and trekking eventually to Mafeking.\r\nHe attended the Lutheran Mission School at the Pniel Mission Station,\r\nnear Barkly West, as a boy, under the Rev. G. E. Westphal;\r\nand at thirteen years he passed the fourth standard, which was as far\r\nas the school could take him.  For the next three years he acted\r\nas pupil-teacher, receiving private lessons from the Rev. and Mrs. Westphal.\r\nAt the age of sixteen he joined the Cape Government service as letter-carrier\r\nin the Kimberley Post Office.  There he studied languages in his spare time,\r\nand passed the Cape Civil Service examination in typewriting,\r\nDutch and native languages, heading the list of successful candidates\r\nin each subject.  Shortly before the war he was transferred to Mafeking\r\nas interpreter, and during the siege was appointed Dutch interpreter\r\nto the Court of Summary Jurisdiction, presided over by Lord Edward Cecil.\r\nThe Magistrate's clerks having taken up arms, Mr. Plaatje became\r\nconfidential clerk to Mr. C. G. H. Bell, who administered Native affairs\r\nduring the siege.  Mr. Plaatje drew up weekly reports on the Native situation,\r\nwhich were greatly valued by the military authorities,\r\nand in a letter written to a friend asserted with some sense of humour\r\nthat \"this arrangement was so satisfactory that Mr. Bell was created a C.M.G.\r\nat the end of the siege.\"\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the colour bar, Mr. Plaatje, in all probability,\r\nwould have been holding an important position in the Department\r\nof Native Affairs; as it was, he entered the ranks of journalism\r\nas Editor, in the first place, of `Koranta ea Becoana', a weekly paper\r\nin English and Sechuana, which was financed by the Chief Silas Molema\r\nand existed for seven years very successfully.  At the present moment\r\nMr. Plaatje is Editor of the `Tsala ea Batho' (The People's Friend)\r\nat Kimberley, which is owned by a native syndicate, having its headquarters\r\nin the Free State.  Mr. Plaatje has acted as interpreter\r\nfor many distinguished visitors to South Africa, and holds autograph letters\r\nfrom the Duke of Connaught, Mr. Chamberlain, and other notabilities.\r\nHe visited Mr. Abraham Fischer quite lately and obtained from him\r\na promise to introduce a Bill into Parliament ameliorating the position\r\nof the Natives of the Orange River Colony, who are debarred by law\r\nfrom receiving titles to landed property.  Mr. Plaatje's articles\r\non native affairs have been marked by the robust common sense and moderation\r\nso characteristic of Mr. Booker Washington.  He realizes\r\nthe great debt which the Natives owe to the men who brought\r\ncivilization to South Africa.  He is no agitator or firebrand,\r\nno stirrer-up of bad feeling between black and white.  He accepts\r\nthe position which the Natives occupy to-day in the body politic\r\nas the natural result of their lack of education and civilization.\r\nHe is devoted to his own people, and notes with ever-increasing regret\r\nthe lack of understanding and knowledge of those people,\r\nwhich is so palpable in the vast majority of the letters and leading articles\r\nwritten on the native question.  As an educated Native with liberal ideas\r\nhe rather resents the power and authority of the uneducated native chiefs\r\nwho govern by virtue of their birth alone, and he writes and speaks\r\nfor an entirely new school of native thought.  The opinion of such a man\r\nought to carry weight when native affairs are being discussed.\r\nWe have fallen into the habit of discussing and legislating\r\nfor the Native without ever stopping for one moment to consider\r\nwhat the Native himself thinks.  No one but a fool will deny\r\nthe importance of knowing what the Native thinks before we legislate for him.\r\nIt is in the hope of enlightening an otherwise barren controversy\r\nthat we shall publish from time to time Mr. Plaatje's letters,\r\ncommending them always to the more thoughtful and practical of our readers.\r\n-- `Pretoria News', September, 1910.\r\n==\r\n\r\n(The writer of this appreciation, the Editor of the Pretoria evening paper,\r\nwas Reuter's war correspondent in the siege of Mafeking.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        (B)     Prologue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have often read books, written by well-known scholars,\r\nwho disavow, on behalf of their works, any claim to literary perfection.\r\nHow much more necessary, then, that a South African native workingman,\r\nwho has never received any secondary training, should in attempting authorship\r\ndisclaim, on behalf of his work, any title to literary merit.\r\nMine is but a sincere narrative of a melancholy situation,\r\nin which, with all its shortcomings, I have endeavoured to describe\r\nthe difficulties of the South African Natives under a very strange law,\r\nso as most readily to be understood by the sympathetic reader.\r\n\r\nThe information contained in the following chapters is the result\r\nof personal observations made by the author in certain districts of\r\nthe Transvaal, Orange \"Free\" State and the Province of the Cape of Good Hope.\r\nIn pursuance of this private inquiry, I reached Lady Brand\r\nearly in September, 1913, when, my financial resources being exhausted,\r\nI decided to drop the inquiry and return home.  But my friend,\r\nMr. W. Z. Fenyang, of the farm Rietfontein, in the \"Free\" State,\r\noffered to convey me to the South of Moroka district,\r\nwhere I saw much of the trouble, and further, he paid my railway fare\r\nfrom Thaba Ncho back to Kimberley.\r\n\r\nIn the following November, it was felt that as Mr. Saul Msane,\r\nthe organizer for the South African Native National Congress,\r\nwas touring the eastern districts of the Transvaal,\r\nand Mr. Dube, the President, was touring the northern districts and Natal,\r\nand as the finances of the Congress did not permit an additional traveller,\r\nno information would be forthcoming in regard to the operation\r\nof the mischievous Act in the Cape Province.  So Mr. J. M. Nyokong,\r\nof the farm Maseru, offered to bear part of the expenses if I would undertake\r\na visit to the Cape.  I must add that beyond spending six weeks\r\non the tour to the Cape, the visit did not cost me much,\r\nfor Mr. W. D. Soga, of King Williamstown, very generously\r\nsupplemented Mr. Nyokong's offer and accompanied me on a part of the journey.\r\n\r\nBesides the information received and the hospitality enjoyed\r\nfrom these and other friends, the author is indebted, for further information,\r\nto Mr. Attorney Msimang, of Johannesburg.  Mr. Msimang toured\r\nsome of the Districts, compiled a list of some of the sufferers\r\nfrom the Natives' Land Act, and learnt the circumstances of their eviction.\r\nHis list, however, is not full, its compilation having been undertaken\r\nin May, 1914, when the main exodus of the evicted tenants\r\nto the cities and Protectorates had already taken place,\r\nand when eyewitnesses of the evils of the Act had already fled the country.\r\nBut it is useful in showing that the persecution is still continuing,\r\nfor, according to this list, a good many families were evicted\r\na year after the Act was enforced, and many more were at that time\r\nunder notice to quit.  Mr. Msimang, modestly states in an explanatory note,\r\nthat his pamphlet contains \"comparatively few instances\r\nof actual cases of hardship under the Natives' Land Act, 1913,\r\nto vindicate the leaders of the South African Native National Congress\r\nfrom the gross imputation, by the Native Affairs Department,\r\nthat they make general allegations of hardships without producing\r\nany specific cases that can bear examination.\"  Mr. Msimang,\r\nwho took a number of sworn statements from the sufferers,\r\nadds that \"in Natal, for example, all of these instances\r\nhave been reported to the Magistrates and the Chief Native Commissioner.\r\nEvery time they are told to find themselves other places,\r\nor remain where they are under labour conditions.  At Peters and Colworth,\r\nseventy-nine and a hundred families respectively are being ejected\r\nby the Government itself without providing land for them.\"\r\n\r\nSome readers may perhaps think that I have taken the Colonial Parliament\r\nrather severely to task.  But to any reader who holds\r\nwith Bacon, that \"the pencil hath laboured more in describing\r\nthe afflictions of Job than the felicities of Solomon,\" I would say:\r\n\"Do, if we dare make the request, and place yourself in our shoes.\"\r\nIf, after a proper declaration of war, you found your kinsmen\r\ndriven from pillar to post in the manner that the South African Natives\r\nhave been harried and scurried by Act No. 27 of 1913, you would,\r\nthough aware that it is part of the fortunes of war, find it difficult\r\nto suppress your hatred of the enemy.  Similarly, if you see\r\nyour countrymen and countrywomen driven from home, their homes broken up,\r\nwith no hopes of redress, on the mandate of a Government\r\nto which they had loyally paid taxation without representation --\r\ndriven from their homes, because they do not want to become servants;\r\nand when you know that half of these homeless ones have perforce\r\nsubmitted to the conditions and accepted service on terms\r\nthat are unprofitable to themselves; if you remember\r\nthat more would have submitted but for the fact that no master has any use\r\nfor a servant with forty head of cattle, or a hundred or more sheep;\r\nand if you further bear in mind that many landowners are anxious\r\nto live at peace with, and to keep your people as tenants,\r\nbut that they are debarred from doing so by your Government\r\nwhich threatens them with a fine of 100 Pounds or six months' imprisonment,\r\nyou would, I think, likewise find it very difficult to maintain a level head\r\nor wield a temperate pen.\r\n\r\nFor instance, let us say, the London County Council decrees\r\nthat no man shall rent a room, or hire a house, in the City of London\r\nunless he be a servant in the employ of the landlord, adding that\r\nthere shall be a fine of one hundred pounds on any one who attempts\r\nto sell a house to a non-householder; imagine such a thing and its effects,\r\nthen you have some approach to an accurate picture of the operation\r\nof the South African Natives' Land Act of 1913.  In conclusion,\r\nlet me ask the reader's support in our campaign for the repeal of such a law,\r\nand in making this request I pray that none of my readers may live\r\nto find themselves in a position so intolerable.\r\n\r\nWhen the narrative of this book up to Chapter XVIII was completed,\r\nit was felt that an account of life in South Africa,\r\nwithout a reference to the war or the rebellion would be\r\nbut a story half told, and so Chapters XIX-XXV were added.\r\nIt will be observed that Chapters XX-XXIV, unlike the rest of the book,\r\nare not the result of the writer's own observations.\r\nThe writer is indebted for much of the information in these five chapters\r\nto the Native Press and some Dutch newspapers which his devoted wife\r\nposted to him with every mail.  These papers have been\r\na source of useful information.  Of the Dutch newspapers\r\nspecial thanks are due to `Het Westen' of Potchefstroom,\r\nwhich has since March 1915 changed its name to `Het Volksblad'.\r\nMost of the Dutch journals, especially in the northern Provinces, take up\r\nthe views of English-speaking Dutch townsmen (solicitors and Bank clerks),\r\nand publish them as the opinion of the South African Dutch.\r\n`Het Westen' (now `Het Volksblad'), on the other hand,\r\ninterprets the Dutch view, sound, bad or indifferent, exactly as we ourselves\r\nhave heard it expressed by Dutchmen at their own farms.\r\n\r\nTranslations of the Tipperary Chorus into some of the languages\r\nwhich are spoken by the white and black inhabitants of South Africa\r\nhave been used here and there as mottoes; and as this book is a plea\r\nin the main for help against the \"South African war of extermination\",\r\nit is hoped that admirers of Tommy Atkins will sympathize with\r\nthe coloured sufferers, who also sing Tommy Atkins' war songs.\r\n\r\nThis appeal is not on behalf of the naked hordes of cannibals\r\nwho are represented in fantastic pictures displayed\r\nin the shop-windows in Europe, most of them imaginary;\r\nbut it is on behalf of five million loyal British subjects who shoulder\r\n\"the black man's burden\" every day, doing so without looking forward\r\nto any decoration or thanks.  \"The black man's burden\" includes\r\nthe faithful performance of all the unskilled and least paying labour\r\nin South Africa, the payment of direct taxation to the various Municipalities,\r\nat the rate of from 1s. to 5s. per mensum per capita (to develop and beautify\r\nthe white quarters of the towns while the black quarters remain unattended)\r\nbesides taxes to the Provincial and Central Government, varying from\r\n12s. to 3 Pounds 12s. per annum, for the maintenance of Government Schools\r\nfrom which native children are excluded.  In addition to these\r\nnative duties and taxes, it is also part of \"the black man's burden\" to pay\r\nall duties levied from the favoured race.  With the increasing difficulty\r\nof finding openings to earn the money for paying these multifarious taxes,\r\nthe dumb pack-ox, being inarticulate in the Councils of State,\r\nhas no means of making known to its \"keeper\" that the burden\r\nis straining its back to breaking point.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir John French appealed to the British people for more shells\r\nduring Easter week, the Governor-General of South Africa\r\naddressing a fashionable crowd at the City Hall, Johannesburg,\r\nmost of whom had never seen the mouth of a mine, congratulated them\r\non the fact that \"under the strain of war and rebellion\r\nthe gold industry had been maintained at full pitch,\"\r\nand he added that \"every ounce of gold was worth many shells\r\nto the Allies.\"  But His Excellency had not a word of encouragement\r\nfor the 200,000 subterranean heroes who by day and by night,\r\nfor a mere pittance, lay down their limbs and their lives\r\nto the familiar \"fall of rock\" and who, at deep levels ranging from\r\n1,000 feet to 1,000 yards in the bowels of the earth, sacrifice their lungs\r\nto the rock dust which develops miners' phthisis and pneumonia --\r\npoor reward, but a sacrifice that enables the world's richest gold mines,\r\nin the Johannesburg area alone, to maintain the credit of the Empire\r\nwith a weekly output of 750,000 Pounds worth of raw gold.\r\nSurely the appeal of chattels who render service of such great value\r\ndeserves the attention of the British people.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would say as Professor Du Bois says in his book\r\n`The Souls of Black Folk', on the relations between\r\nthe sons of master and man, \"I have not glossed over matters\r\nfor policy's sake, for I fear we have already gone too far\r\nin that sort of thing.  On the other hand I have sincerely sought\r\nto let no unfair exaggerations creep in.  I do not doubt\r\nthat in some communities conditions are better than those I have indicated;\r\nwhile I am no less certain that in other communities they are far worse.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I       A Retrospect\r\n\r\n  I am Black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar,\r\n    as the curtains of Solomon.\r\n  Look not upon me because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me:\r\n    my mother's children were angry with me; they made me\r\n    the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.\r\n                                       The Song of Songs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAwaking on Friday morning, June 20, 1913, the South African Native\r\nfound himself, not actually a slave, but a pariah in the land of his birth.\r\n\r\nThe 4,500,000 black South Africans are domiciled as follows:\r\nOne and three-quarter millions in Locations and Reserves,\r\nover half a million within municipalities or in urban areas,\r\nand nearly a million as squatters on farms owned by Europeans.\r\nThe remainder are employed either on the public roads or railway lines,\r\nor as servants by European farmers, qualifying, that is,\r\nby hard work and saving to start farming on their own account.\r\n\r\nA squatter in South Africa is a native who owns some livestock and,\r\nhaving no land of his own, hires a farm or grazing and ploughing rights\r\nfrom a landowner, to raise grain for his own use and feed his stock.\r\nHence, these squatters are hit very hard by an Act which\r\npassed both Houses of Parliament during the session of 1913,\r\nreceived the signature of the Governor-General on June 16,\r\nwas gazetted on June 19, and forthwith came into operation.\r\nIt may be here mentioned that on that day Lord Gladstone signed no fewer\r\nthan sixteen new Acts of Parliament -- some of them being rather voluminous --\r\nwhile three days earlier, His Excellency signed another batch of eight,\r\nof which the bulk was beyond the capability of any mortal to read and digest\r\nin four days.\r\n\r\nBut the great revolutionary change thus wrought by a single stroke of the pen,\r\nin the condition of the Native, was not realized by him\r\nuntil about the end of June.  As a rule many farm tenancies expire\r\nat the end of the half-year, so that in June, 1913, not knowing\r\nthat it was impracticable to make fresh contracts, some Natives\r\nunwittingly went to search for new places of abode, which some farmers,\r\nignorant of the law, quite as unwittingly accorded them.\r\nIt was only when they went to register the new tenancies\r\nthat the law officers of the Crown laid bare the cruel fact\r\nthat to provide a landless Native with accommodation was forbidden\r\nunder a penalty of 100 Pounds, or six months' imprisonment.\r\nThen only was the situation realized.\r\n\r\nOther Natives who had taken up fresh places on European farms\r\nunder verbal contracts, which needed no registration, actually founded\r\nnew homes in spite of the law, neither the white farmer nor the native tenant\r\nbeing aware of the serious penalties they were exposed to\r\nby their verbal contracts.\r\n\r\nIn justice to the Government, it must be stated that no police officers\r\nscoured the country in search of lawbreakers, to prosecute them\r\nunder this law.  Had this been done, many 100 Pound cheques\r\nwould have passed into the Government coffers during that black July,\r\nthe first month after Lord Gladstone affixed his signature\r\nto the Natives' Land Act, No. 27 of 1913.\r\n\r\nThe complication of this cruel law is made manifest by the fact\r\nthat it was found necessary for a high officer of the Government\r\nto tour the Provinces soon after the Act came into force,\r\nwith the object of \"teaching\" Magistrates how to administer it.\r\nA Congress of Magistrates -- a most unusual thing -- was also called\r\nin Pretoria to find a way for carrying out the King's writ\r\nin the face of the difficulties arising from this tangle of the Act.\r\nWe may add that nearly all white lawyers in South Africa,\r\nto whom we spoke about this measure, had either not seen the Act at all,\r\nor had not read it carefully, so that in both cases they could not tell\r\nexactly for whose benefit it had been passed.  The study of this law\r\nrequired a much longer time than the lawyers, unless specially briefed,\r\ncould devote to it, so that they hardly knew what all the trouble was about.\r\nIt was the Native in the four Provinces who knew all about it,\r\nfor he had not read it in books but had himself been through its mill,\r\nwhich like an automatic machine ground him relentlessly\r\nsince the end of the month of June.  Not the least but one of\r\nthe cruellest and most ironical phases -- and nearly every clause of this Act\r\nteems with irony -- is the Schedule or appendix giving the so-called\r\nScheduled Native Areas; and what are these \"Scheduled Native Areas\"?\r\n\r\nThey are the Native Locations which were reserved for the exclusive use\r\nof certain native clans.  They are inalienable and cannot be bought or sold,\r\nyet the Act says that in these \"Scheduled Native Areas\" Natives only\r\nmay buy land.  The areas being inalienable, not even members of the clans,\r\nfor whose benefit the locations are held in trust, can buy land therein.\r\nThe areas could only be sold if the whole clan rebelled; in that case\r\nthe location would be confiscated.  But as long as the clans of the location\r\nremain loyal to the Government, nobody can buy any land within these areas.\r\nUnder the respective charters of these areas, not even a member of the clan\r\ncan get a separate title as owner in an area -- let alone a native outsider\r\nwho had grown up among white people and done all his farming\r\non white man's land.\r\n\r\nIf we exclude the arid tracts of Bechuanaland, these Locations\r\nappear to have been granted on such a small scale that each of them\r\ngot so overcrowded that much of the population had to go out and settle\r\non the farms of white farmers through lack of space in the Locations.\r\nYet a majority of the legislators, although well aware of all\r\nthese limitations, and without remedying any of them, legislate,\r\nshall we say, \"with its tongue in its cheek\" that only Natives may buy land\r\nin Native Locations.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Locations form but one-eighteenth of the total area of the Union.\r\nTheoretically, then, the 4,500,000 Natives may \"buy\" land in only\r\none-eighteenth part of the Union, leaving the remaining seventeen parts\r\nfor the one million whites.  It is moreover true that, numerically,\r\nthe Act was passed by the consent of a majority of both Houses of Parliament,\r\nbut it is equally true that it was steam-rolled into the statute book\r\nagainst the bitterest opposition of the best brains of both Houses.\r\nA most curious aspect of this singular law is that even the Minister,\r\nsince deceased, who introduced it, subsequently declared himself against it,\r\nadding that he only forced it through in order to stave off something worse.\r\nIndeed, it is correct to say that Mr. Sauer, who introduced the Bill,\r\nspoke against it repeatedly in the House; he deleted the milder provisions,\r\ninserted more drastic amendments, spoke repeatedly against\r\nhis own amendments, then in conclusion he would combat\r\nhis own arguments by calling the ministerial steam-roller\r\nto support the Government and vote for the drastic amendments.\r\nThe only explanation of the puzzle constituted as such by these\r\n\"hot-and-cold\" methods is that Mr. Sauer was legislating for an electorate,\r\nat the expense of another section of the population which was without\r\ndirect representation in Parliament.  None of the non-European races\r\nin the Provinces of Natal, Transvaal and the \"Free\" State\r\ncan exercise the franchise.  They have no say in the selection of members\r\nfor the Union Parliament.  That right is only limited to white men,\r\nso that a large number of the members of Parliament who voted for this measure\r\nhave no responsibility towards the black races.\r\n\r\nBefore reproducing this tyrannical enactment it would perhaps be well\r\nto recapitulate briefly the influences that led up to it.\r\nWhen the Union of the South African Colonies became\r\nan accomplished fact, a dread was expressed by ex-Republicans\r\nthat the liberal native policy of the Cape would supersede\r\nthe repressive policy of the old Republics, and they lost no time\r\nin taking definite steps to force down the throats of the Union Legislature,\r\nas it were, laws which the Dutch Presidents of pre-war days,\r\nwith the British suzerainty over their heads, did not dare enforce\r\nagainst the Native people then under them.  With the formation of the Union,\r\nthe Imperial Government, for reasons which have never been\r\nsatisfactorily explained, unreservedly handed over the Natives\r\nto the colonists, and these colonists, as a rule, are dominated\r\nby the Dutch Republican spirit.  Thus the suzerainty of Great Britain,\r\nwhich under the reign of Her late Majesty Victoria, of blessed memory,\r\nwas the Natives' only bulwark, has now apparently been withdrawn or relaxed,\r\nand the Republicans, like a lot of bloodhounds long held in the leash,\r\nuse the free hand given by the Imperial Government not only to guard against\r\na possible supersession of Cape ideals of toleration, but to effectively\r\nextend throughout the Union the drastic native policy pursued by the Province\r\nwhich is misnamed \"Free\" State, and enforce it with the utmost rigour.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of the Union, it would seem that General Botha\r\nmade an honest attempt to live up to his London promises,\r\nthat are mentioned by Mr. Merriman in his speech (reproduced elsewhere)\r\non the second reading of the Bill in Parliament.  It would seem\r\nthat General Botha endeavoured to allay British apprehensions and concern\r\nfor the welfare of the Native population.  In pursuance of this policy\r\nGeneral Botha won the approbation of all Natives by appointing Hon. H. Burton,\r\na Cape Minister, to the portfolio of Native Affairs.  That the appointment\r\nwas a happy one, from the native point of view, became manifest\r\nwhen Mr. Burton signalized the ushering in of Union, by releasing\r\nChief Dinizulu-ka-Cetywayo, who at that time was undergoing\r\na sentence of imprisonment imposed by the Natal Supreme Court,\r\nand by the restoration to Dinizulu of his pension of 500 Pounds a year.\r\nAlso, in deference to the wishes of the Native Congress,\r\nMr. Burton abrogated two particularly obnoxious Natal measures,\r\none legalizing the \"Sibalo\" system of forced labour, the other prohibiting\r\npublic meetings by Natives without the consent of the Government.\r\nThese abrogations placed the Natives of Natal in almost the same position\r\nas the Cape Natives though without giving them the franchise.\r\nSo, too, when a drastic Squatters' Bill was gazetted early in 1912,\r\nand the recently formed Native National Congress sent a deputation\r\nto interview Mr. Burton in Capetown; after hearing the deputation,\r\nhe graciously consented to withdraw the proposed measure,\r\npending the allotment of new Locations in which Natives evicted\r\nby such a measure could find an asylum.  In further deference\r\nto the representations of the Native Congress, in which they were supported\r\nby Senators the Hon. W. P. Schreiner, Colonel Stanford, and Mr. Krogh,\r\nthe Union Government gazetted another Bill in January, 1911,\r\nto amend an anomaly which, at that time, was peculiar to the \"Free\" State:\r\nan anomaly under which a Native can neither purchase nor lease land,\r\nand native landowners in the \"Free\" State could only sell their land\r\nto the white people.\r\n\r\nThe gazetted Bill proposed to legalize only in one district\r\nof the Orange \"Free\" State the sale of landed property by a Native\r\nto another Native as well as to a white man, but it did not propose\r\nto enable Natives to buy land from white men.  The object of the Bill\r\nwas to remove a hardship, mentioned elsewhere in this sketch,\r\nby which a \"Free\" State Native was by law debarred from inheriting\r\nlanded property left to him under his uncle's will.  But against\r\nsuch small attempts at reform, proposed or carried out by the Union Government\r\nin the interest of the Natives, granted in small instalments of a teaspoonful\r\nat a time -- reforms dictated solely by feelings of justice and equity --\r\nex-Republicans were furious.\r\n\r\nFrom platform, Press, and pulpit it was suggested that\r\nGeneral Botha's administration was too pro-English and needed overhauling.\r\nThe Dutch peasants along the countryside were inflamed by hearing\r\nthat their gallant leader desired to Anglicize the country.\r\nNothing was more repellent to the ideas of the backveld Dutch,\r\nand so at small meetings in the country districts resolutions were passed\r\nstating that the Botha administration had outlived its usefulness.\r\nThese resolutions reaching the Press from day to day\r\nhad the effect of stirring up the Dutch voters against the Ministry,\r\nand particularly against the head.  At this time General Botha's sound policy\r\nbegan to weaken.  He transferred Hon. H. Burton, first Minister of Natives,\r\nto the portfolio of Railways and Harbours, and appointed General Hertzog,\r\nof all people in the world, to the portfolio of Native Affairs.\r\n\r\nThe good-humoured indulgence of some Dutch and English farmers towards\r\ntheir native squatters, and the affectionate loyalty of some of these\r\nnative squatters in return, will cause a keen observer, arriving at\r\na South African farm, to be lost in admiration for this mutual good feeling.\r\nHe will wonder as to the meaning of the fabled bugbear anent the alleged\r\nstruggle between white and black, which in reality appears to exist\r\nonly in the fertile brain of the politician.  Thus let the new arrival go\r\nto one of the farms in the Bethlehem or Harrismith Districts for example,\r\nand see how willingly the Native toils in the fields; see him\r\ngathering in his crops and handing over the white farmer's share of the crop\r\nto the owner of the land; watch the farmer receiving his tribute\r\nfrom the native tenants, and see him deliver the first prize\r\nto the native tenant who raised the largest crop during that season;\r\nlet him also see both the Natives and the landowning white farmers\r\nfollowing to perfection the give-and-take policy of \"live and let live\",\r\nand he will conclude that it would be gross sacrilege to attempt to disturb\r\nsuch harmonious relations between these people of different races and colours.\r\nBut with a ruthless hand the Natives' Land Act has succeeded\r\nin remorselessly destroying those happy relations.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, General Hertzog, the new Minister of Native Affairs,\r\ntravelled up and down the country lecturing farmers on their folly\r\nin letting ground to the Natives; the racial extremists of his party\r\nhailed him as the right man for the post, for, as his conduct showed them,\r\nhe would soon \"fix up\" the Natives.  At one or two places\r\nhe was actually welcomed as the future Prime Minister of the Union.\r\nOn the other hand, General Botha, who at that time seemed\r\nto have become visibly timid, endeavoured to ingratiate himself\r\nwith his discontented supporters by joining his lieutenant\r\nin travelling to and fro, denouncing the Dutch farmers for not\r\nexpelling the Natives from their farms and replacing them with poor whites.\r\nThis became a regular Ministerial campaign against the Natives,\r\nso that it seemed clear that if any Native could still find a place\r\nin the land, it was not due to the action of the Government.\r\nIn his campaign the Premier said other unhappy things which were\r\ndiametrically opposed to his London speeches of two years before;\r\nand while the Dutch colonists railed at him for trying to Anglicize\r\nthe country, English speakers and writers justly accused him of speaking\r\nwith two voices; cartoonists, too, caricatured him as having two heads --\r\none, they said, for London, and the second one for South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe uncertain tenure by which Englishmen in the public service\r\nheld their posts became the subject of debates in the Union Parliament,\r\nand the employment of Government servants of colour was decidedly precarious.\r\nThey were swept out of the Railway and Postal Service\r\nwith a strong racial broom, in order to make room for poor whites,\r\nmainly of Dutch descent.  Concession after concession\r\nwas wrung from the Government by fanatical Dutch postulants for office,\r\nfor Government doles and other favours, who, like the daughters of\r\nthe horse-leech in the Proverbs of Solomon, continually cried, \"Give, give.\"\r\nBy these events we had clearly turned the corner and were pacing backwards\r\nto pre-Union days, going back, back, and still further backward,\r\nto the conditions which prevailed in the old Republics,\r\nand (if a check is not applied) we shall steadily drift back\r\nto the days of the old Dutch East Indian administration.\r\n\r\nThe Bill which proposed to ameliorate the \"Free\" State cruelty,\r\nto which reference has been made above, was dropped like a hot potato.\r\nMinisters made some wild and undignified speeches, of which\r\nthe following spicy extract, from a speech by the Rt. Hon. Abraham Fischer\r\nto his constituents at Bethlehem, is a typical sample --\r\n\r\n\"What is it you want?\" he asked.  \"We have passed all the coolie* laws\r\nand we have passed all the Kafir laws.  The `Free' State\r\nhas been safeguarded and all her colour laws have been adopted by Parliament.\r\nWhat more can the Government do for you?\"  And so the Union ship\r\nin this reactionary sea sailed on and on and on, until she struck an iceberg\r\n-- the sudden dismissal of General Hertzog.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* A contemptuous South African term for British Indians.\r\n--\r\n\r\nTo the bitter sorrow of his admirers, General Hertzog,\r\nwho is the fearless exponent of Dutch ideals, was relieved of\r\nhis portfolios of Justice and Native Affairs -- it was whispered\r\nas a result of a suggestion from London; and then the Dutch extremists,\r\nin consequence of their favourite's dismissal, gave vent to their anger\r\nin the most disagreeable manner.  One could infer from their platform speeches\r\nthat, from their point of view, scarcely any one else had any rights\r\nin South Africa, and least of all the man with a black skin.\r\n\r\nIn the face of this, the Government's timidity was almost unendurable.\r\nThey played up to the desires of the racial extremists, with the result that\r\na deadlock overtook the administration.  Violent laws like the Immigration Law\r\n(against British Indians and alien Asiatics) and the Natives' Land\r\nwere indecently hurried through Parliament to allay\r\nthe susceptibilities of \"Free\" State Republicans.  No Minister found time\r\nto undertake such useful legislation as the Coloured People's Occupation Bill,\r\nthe Native Disputes Bill, the Marriage Bill, the University Bill, etc., etc.\r\nAn apology was demanded from the High Commissioner in London\r\nfor delivering himself of sentiments which were felt to be too British\r\nfor the palates of his Dutch employers in South Africa, and the Prime Minister\r\nhad almost to apologize for having at times so far forgotten himself\r\nas to act more like a Crown Minister than a simple Africander.\r\n\"Free\" State demands became so persistent that Ministers seemed\r\nto have forgotten the assurances they gave His Majesty's Government in London\r\nregarding the safety of His Majesty's coloured subjects within the Union.\r\nThey trampled under foot their own election pledges, made during\r\nthe first Union General Election, guaranteeing justice and fair treatment\r\nto the law-abiding Natives.\r\n\r\nThe campaign, to compass the elimination of the blacks\r\nfrom the farms, was not at all popular with landowners,\r\nwho made huge profits out of the renting of their farms to Natives.\r\nPlatform speakers and newspaper writers coined an opprobrious phrase\r\nwhich designated this letting of farms to Natives as \"Kafir-farming\",\r\nand attempted to prove that it was almost as immoral as \"baby-farming\".\r\nBut landowners pocketed the annual rents, and showed no inclination\r\nto substitute the less industrious \"poor whites\" for the more\r\nindustrious Natives.  Old Baas M----, a typical Dutch landowner\r\nof the \"Free\" State, having collected his share of the crop of 1912,\r\naddressing a few words of encouragement to his native tenants,\r\non the subject of expelling the blacks from the farms, said in the Taal:\r\n\"How dare any number of men, wearing tall hats and frock coats,\r\nliving in Capetown hotels at the expense of other men, order me\r\nto evict my Natives?  This is my ground; it cost my money, not Parliament's,\r\nand I will see them banged (barst) before I do it.\"\r\n\r\nIt then became evident that the authority of Parliament\r\nwould have to be sought to compel the obstinate landowners to\r\nget rid of their Natives.  And the compliance of Parliament with this demand\r\nwas the greatest Ministerial surrender to the Republican malcontents,\r\nresulting in the introduction and passage of the Natives' Land Act of 1913,\r\ninasmuch as the Act decreed, in the name of His Majesty the King,\r\nthat pending the adoption of a report to be made by a commission,\r\nsomewhere in the dim and unknown future, it shall be unlawful\r\nfor Natives to buy or lease land, except in scheduled native areas.\r\nAnd under severe pains and penalties they were to be deprived\r\nof the bare human rights of living on the land, except as servants\r\nin the employ of the whites -- rights which were never seriously challenged\r\nunder the Republican regime, no matter how politicians raved\r\nagainst the Natives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II      The Grim Struggle between Right and Wrong,\r\n                  and the Latter Carries the Day\r\n\r\n  Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness\r\n    which they have prescribed;\r\n  To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the fruit\r\n    from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey,\r\n    and that they may rob the fatherless.\r\n                                       Isaiah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn February 18, 1913, General L. Lemmer, member for Marico, Transvaal,\r\nasked the Minister of Lands: --  (a)  How many farms or portions of farms\r\nin the Transvaal Province have during the last three years been registered\r\nin the names of Natives; (b) what is the extent of the land so registered;\r\nand (c) how much was paid for it?\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Lands replied:  (a) 78 farms; (b) 144,416 morgen;\r\nand (c) 94,907 Pounds.\r\n\r\nSome very disturbing elements suggest themselves in this question\r\nand in its prompt answer.  A question of the kind should have taken\r\nsome time to reach Pretoria from the seat of Parliament; more time\r\nto search for and compile the necessary information, and further time\r\nto get the answer to the Table of the House of Assembly in Capetown.\r\nFor instance, on March 11 Mr. T. L. Schreiner called for an explanation\r\nin connexion with the same return.  He had to ask again on April 1,\r\nthe answer in each instance being that the required \"information\r\nhad been telegraphed for and would be laid on the table when it is available\"\r\n(vide Union Hansard, pp. 777 and 1,175).  It was only on May 13\r\n-- two months and two days after -- that an answer to Mr. Schreiner's\r\nquestion of March 11 could be furnished.\r\n\r\nAgain, on May 20 Mr. Schreiner called for a similar return,\r\nembracing the four Provinces of the Union.*  If it were so easy\r\nfor General Lemmer to get a reply in regard to the Transvaal,\r\nwhere most of the registration took place, it should have been\r\nrelatively more easy to add the information from the Cape and Natal,\r\nsince no registration could have taken place in the Orange \"Free\" State,\r\nwhere Natives cannot buy land.  But strange to say, all that Mr. Schreiner\r\ncould get out of the Minister was a promise to furnish a reply\r\nwhen it is available, and it does not appear to be on record\r\nthat it was ever furnished during that session.  Therefore, a Native\r\ncannot be blamed for suspecting that when General Lemmer asked his question,\r\nthe return was \"cut and dried\" and available to be laid on the table\r\nas soon as it was called for.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* It does not appear to have occurred to any one to call for a return\r\n  showing transfers of land from blacks to whites.\r\n--\r\n\r\nAnother significant point is that the questioner did not want to know\r\nthe extent of land bought by Natives, but of the land\r\n\"registered in their names\" during the period; and Mr. Schreiner\r\nwas able to show later in the session by an analysis of the return\r\nthat it mainly comprised land awarded to Native tribes\r\nby the Republican Government, some of it when they conquered the country.\r\nThey include farms bought or awarded to Natives as long ago\r\nas the early 60's and 70's, but the owners were not able to obtain titles\r\nas the late Republican Government did not allow Natives to register land\r\nin their own names.  They had been held in trust for them\r\nby European friends or missionaries, and it was only during\r\nthe last three years that the owners claimed direct titles,\r\nwhich right was restored to them since the British occupation.\r\n\r\nBut the Lemmer Return did its fell work.  It scared every white man\r\nin the country.  They got alarmed to hear that Natives had\r\nduring the past three (!) years \"bought\" land to the extent of 50,000 morgen\r\nper annum.\r\n\r\nThanks to Mr. Schreiner's questions, however, the misleading features\r\nof the statistical scarecrow were revealed -- but, unfortunately too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Origin of the Trouble\r\n\r\nOn February 28, 1913, Mr. J. G. Keyter (a \"Free\" State member) moved:\r\nThat the Government be requested to submit to the House\r\nDURING THE PRESENT SESSION a general Pass and Squatters Bill\r\nto prohibit coloured people (1) from WANDERING ABOUT WITHOUT A PROPER PASS;\r\n(2) from SQUATTING ON FARMS; and (3) from SOWING ON THE SHARE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nMr. T. P. Brain,* another \"Free\" Stater, seconded the motion.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* This gentleman died during 1913.\r\n--\r\n\r\nMr. P. G. W. Grobler,* a Transvaaler, moved (as an amendment)\r\nto add at the end of the motion:  \"and further TO TAKE EFFECTIVE MEASURES\r\nTO RESTRICT THE PURCHASE AND LEASE OF LAND BY NATIVES.\"\r\n\r\n--\r\n* Mr. Grobler forfeited his seat when he was convicted of complicity\r\n  in the recent rebellion.\r\n--\r\n\r\nMr. Schreiner strongly protested against both the motion and the amendment.\r\n\r\nThe Minister for Native Affairs* spoke somewhat against Mr. Keyter's motion\r\nbut promised to comply with Mr. Grobler's amendment, which promise he redeemed\r\nby introducing a Natives' Land Bill.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* Hon. J. W. Sauer, Minister of Native Affairs, died a month after the Bill\r\n  became law.\r\n--\r\n\r\nBefore the Bill was introduced, the Minister made the unprecedented\r\nannouncement that the Governor-General had given his assurance\r\nthat the Royal Assent would not be withheld from the Natives' Land Bill.\r\nSection 65 of the South African Constitution provides that the King\r\nmay disallow an Act of Parliament within twelve months\r\nafter the Governor-General signed it.  And the abrogation of the Constitution,\r\nas far as this Bill is concerned, literally gave licence\r\nto the political libertines of South Africa; as, being thus freed\r\nfrom all legislative restraint, they wasted no further time\r\nlistening to such trifles as reason and argument.\r\n\r\nThe following are extracts from the debates on the Natives' Land Bill\r\nas reported in the Union Hansard of 1913.\r\n\r\n==\r\nThe adjourned debate on the motion for the second reading\r\nof the Natives Land Bill was resumed by\r\n\r\nMR. J. X. MERRIMAN (Victoria West).  It was with very great reluctance\r\n(the right hon. gentleman said) that he rose to speak on this measure.\r\nIt would have been more convenient to have given a silent vote,\r\nbut he felt, and he was afraid, that after many years of devoted attention\r\nto this question of the native policy of South Africa, he would not\r\nbe doing his duty if he did not give this House -- for what it was worth --\r\nthe result of his experience through these years.\r\n\r\nHe should like to emphasize a brighter side of the question,\r\nand that was to point out that the Natives, if they were well managed,\r\nwere an invaluable asset to the people of this country.  (Hear, hear.)\r\nLet them take our trade figures and compare them with\r\nthe trade figures of the other large British Dominions.\r\nOur figures were surprising when measured by the white population,\r\nbut if they took the richest Dominion that there was under the British Crown\r\noutside South Africa, and took the trade value of those figures\r\nper head of the white population, and multiply those figures\r\nby our European population, then they might very well apply\r\nany balance they had to our native population, and then they would see,\r\nstrangely enough, that upon that basis it worked out that\r\nthe actual trade of three Natives was worth about that of one white man.\r\nThat, of course, was a very imperfect way of looking at\r\nthe value of these people, because the trade value of some of these Natives\r\nwas far greater than the trade value of some of our white people.\r\nHe had merely indicated these trade figures to show what an enormous asset\r\nwe had in the Natives in that respect.  Let them think\r\nwhat the industry of the Natives had done for us.  Who had built our railways,\r\nwho had dug our mines, and developed this country as far as it was developed?\r\nWho had been the actual manual worker who had done that?  The Native:\r\nthe coloured races of this country.  We must never forget\r\nthat we owed them a debt in that respect -- a debt not often acknowledged\r\nby what we did for them.  Proceeding, he said that they ought to think\r\nwhat they owed to the docility of the Natives, and the wonderfully easy way\r\nin which they had been governed when treated properly.  He also paid a tribute\r\nto the honesty of the Natives.\r\n\r\nWhat must strike any one was the fact that though this Bill was really,\r\nto a certain extent, a beginning, or was thought to be in certain quarters,\r\nof a revolution in their dealing with the native races,\r\nit was not even mentioned in the speech of the Governor-General.\r\nIt fell upon them like a bolt from the blue.  He remembered the afternoon.\r\nThey had heard a very impassioned and very heated speech\r\nfrom the hon. member for Ficksburg on the enormous danger of squatting\r\nin the Free State, and that was the occasion for introducing\r\na general statement of the policy of the Government towards the Natives\r\nand the introduction of this Bill.  He did not think that that was the way\r\nthey liked to see a thing of this magnitude approached.\r\nThey often heard demands for what was called a general declaration of policy\r\nwith regard to native affairs -- a policy which should be applied\r\nto the highest civilized Native, the owner of a farm, and the naked barbarian.\r\nThey could not do it.  People who demanded a general declaration of that kind\r\nhad not had the experience which some of them had had.\r\nThe hon. member who spoke before him said that he was in favour\r\nof the underlying principle of the Bill.  What was the underlying principle?\r\nThe underlying principle was what one read into the Bill.\r\nOne hon. member read into it that it was the separation of the two races.\r\nThat might have been done when the two races first came in contact\r\nat the Fish River, but it could not be done now.  Since then\r\nthey had been developing the country with the labour of these people.\r\nThey had been advancing by our aid.  They had mixed themselves up\r\nwith these people in an inextricable fashion and then some said\r\n\"Haul your native policy out of the drawer and begin with\r\na policy of separation.\"  He was sure that the hon. member\r\nwho had brought in the Bill had no idea of that sort in his mind.\r\nAnother person had the idea that they were going to set up a sort of pale --\r\na sort of kraal in which they were going to drive these people.\r\nThen another gentleman sneered at the policy hitherto adopted,\r\nand he said that one side said that the policy towards the Natives\r\nshould be firm and just, while the other side said that it should be\r\njust and firm.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him that they had not got sufficient information.\r\nBeyond the bald statistics which were given by the Minister\r\nin the course of his interesting and moderate speech, they had nothing.\r\nThey were going into a thing that would stir South Africa from end to end,\r\nand which affected hundreds of thousands of both races.\r\nThey had no information as to what were the ideas of the Natives.\r\nIt was unfortunate that, owing to this lack of information,\r\nwrong ideas had got about with regard to this Bill.  It was difficult\r\nto find out what the Native thought about these things; he doubted\r\nwhether anybody could say that he had got at the mind of the Native.\r\nThe only way, and he must say that he did not take it as a real indication,\r\nwas what they wrote in their newspapers.  He was alarmed, but not surprised,\r\nat some of the articles in their newspapers, because they took their views\r\nfrom the heated speeches and writings in party newspapers\r\nall over the country, and they were very much alarmed.  He thought\r\nthat before a Bill of this sort was passed, there should be some attempt made\r\nto get their views.  As far as one section was concerned,\r\nthe Bill was going to set up a sort of pale -- that there was going to be\r\na sort of kraal in which all the Natives were to be driven,\r\nand they were to be left to develop on their own lines.  To allow them\r\nto go on their own lines was merely to drive them back into barbarism;\r\ntheir own lines meant barbarous lines; their own lines were cruel lines.\r\nAll along they had been bringing them away from their own lines.\r\nIt reminded him of what an English writer said about a similar policy\r\nin Ireland, because when the English went to Ireland\r\nthey regarded the Native Irish in the way some extreme people here\r\nregarded the Natives of South Africa.  They thought they would root them out.\r\nThey treated them as dogs, and thought that they were dogs.\r\nThey set up a pale.  They set the Irish within that pale,\r\nto develop upon their own lines, but there were always Englishmen\r\nliving in that pale, just as in the same way they found Europeans\r\nliving among Natives.  Sir George Davis in describing this policy wrote\r\nthat it was the intention of the Government to set up a separation\r\nbetween English and Irish, intending in time that the English should\r\nroot out the Irish.  If they changed the Irish for Natives they would see\r\nhow the illustration would apply.  A policy more foredoomed to failure\r\nin South Africa could not be initiated.  It was a policy that\r\nwould keep South Africa back, perhaps for ever.  (Hear, hear.)\r\nWhat would be the effect of driving these civilized Natives\r\nback into reserves?  At the present time, every civilized man\r\n-- if they treated him properly -- every civilized man\r\nwas becoming an owner of land outside native reserve, and therefore\r\nhe was an asset of strength to the country.  He was a loyalist.\r\nHe was not going to risk losing his property.  He was on\r\nthe side of the European.  If they drove these people back into reserve\r\nthey became our bitterest enemies.  Therefore, he viewed anything\r\nthat tended that way with the gravest suspicion.  Again, in this Bill\r\nthere was not sufficient distinction between those Natives\r\nwho tried to educate themselves and the ordinary raw barbarian.\r\nThey were all classed under the word \"Native\".\r\n\r\nHe came now to what was the main object of the Bill, and that was:\r\nto do away with the squatting evil.  Why was there a squatting evil?\r\nWas it the fault of the Native?  (An hon. member:  No.)\r\nWas it the fault of the law?  (No.)  They had got the most stringent\r\nlaws concerning Natives of all the laws in the whole country,\r\nin the Province of which his hon. friend (Mr. Keyter) was a member.\r\nHe did not think anything was more surprising than when they came to look\r\nat the increases in the native population in the Orange Free State.\r\nThey had a huge native population in the Cape, and the increase\r\nduring the census periods from 1904 to 1911 -- he wanted hon. members\r\nto pay some attention to this, because it showed the value of legislation --\r\nthe increase in the Cape Province during that period was 8.33 per cent.\r\nIn Natal, which had a huge -- in fact, an overwhelming -- native population,\r\ncuriously enough, the increase was the same, even to the actual\r\ndecimal figure, viz., 8.33 per cent.:  but some allowance must be made,\r\nbecause a large number of Natives were out at work in the mines.\r\nNow, in the Transvaal -- and in taking the Transvaal figures\r\nthese did not apply as regarded squatting, because the increase was mainly due\r\nto the number of Natives employed in the mines.  In the Transvaal\r\nthe Natives increased by 30.1 per cent.  Now, when they came\r\nto his friend's little State, where the most stringent laws were made\r\nto keep out the Natives, how much did they suppose the Natives increased\r\nin the Free State?  By no less than 44 per cent.  (Opposition cheers.)\r\nWas that the fault of the Natives?  No, it was because\r\n-- having the most stringent laws -- the people found it best\r\nto evade those laws.  (Hear, hear.)  He hoped his hon. friend\r\nwould be a little tolerant.  Do let him pick the mote out of his own eye\r\nbefore he tried to pick the beam out of other people's.  (Hear, hear.)\r\nIn the Free State these laws were very severe; for instance,\r\npunishments -- amazing punishments -- were given, and yet the result\r\nwas the increase in five years by 44 per cent. of their native population.\r\nThis was something that they should take a warning by.  They were going\r\nto do away with the squatter in appearance, but he would still survive\r\nas a labour tenant.  They might do away with the labour tenant,\r\nand he would still be surviving as a labour servant.  How was the Government\r\nto distinguish between these?  They had in the Cape a law which stated\r\nhow many labour tenants a man should have upon his farm.\r\n\r\nWhat they wanted in this country was administration and not more legislation,\r\nand if they were to put the laws which they had into force in the Free State\r\nat the present time he had no doubt that there would be a rebellion.\r\n(Hear, hear.)  They would have platforms swarming with people\r\nwho would say that they could not grow one bag of mealies without the Natives.\r\nBut they had the laws to do it.  Now they went and tried in this Bill\r\nto make a uniform law.  Turning towards the Minister, Mr. Merriman said:\r\n\"My poor friend! that after all the years we had laboured together\r\nhe of all people should be the author of a uniform law on native matters!\r\n(Laughter.)  I say this more in sorrow than in anger -- (laughter) --\r\nbecause the conditions were totally different in the four Provinces.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Free State, proceeded Mr. Merriman, the people had most excellent laws\r\nfrom their point of view for keeping out the Natives --\r\nstringent, Draconian, and violent laws, but they were not carried out,\r\nand the Natives had flooded the country.  All they wanted to do\r\nwas to turn the Native from a tenant to a labour tenant, and then salvation\r\nwould be at hand.  He could not see very much difference between the two,\r\nexcept that one was a contented advancing man and the other a discontented man\r\napproaching very closely to the Russian serf -- he was a soul.\r\nShortly we should hear of a farm being up for sale with so many souls.\r\n\r\nIn the Transvaal the problem had been complicated by\r\nthe decisions of the Court and the curious way in which some ground\r\nhad been given out in the Zoutpansberg district, where, he was told,\r\nfarms had been given out on which the Natives had been living for years,\r\nand these farms -- with the Natives on them -- had come into\r\nthe possession of companies and individuals, and now it was proposed\r\nto turn the Natives off.  That would not be an agreeable thing,\r\nbut he would not offer an opinion now as to the justice of it.\r\n\r\nHe would like to revert to the state of things which had grown up\r\nunder the Draconian laws of the Free State.  According to\r\na very interesting Blue-book containing reports of magistrates,\r\none magistrate had reported that \"the pernicious system of squatting\r\nwas detrimental to the working farmer, the Native reaping\r\nthe whole of the benefit.\"  The man who worked generally reaped\r\nthe whole benefit in the long run.  In the Harrismith district\r\nthere were some 40,000 Natives against some 8,000 Europeans.\r\nHow did they get there?  Having been a Free State burgher\r\nhe knew that the Natives had not forced their way in.\r\nThese Natives ploughed on the half-shares, and he would like to know\r\nwhether they were labour tenants or squatters.  If they were squatters\r\nit would require very little dexterous management to convert them\r\ninto labour tenants.  The Magistrate of Hoopstad, went on Mr. Merriman,\r\nhad referred to the pernicious system of native squatters.\r\nBut why did not the Free State magistrates do something and put the law\r\nin force?  That was the principal reason why the House was forced\r\nto pass that Bill without information, and without giving\r\nany opportunity to people who had the deepest interest in this matter\r\nto have their views heard, or to let them know what the House was going to do\r\nbecause the magistrates in the Free State would not enforce the law.\r\nHe did think that was rather hard.  In conclusion Mr. Merriman said:\r\nI dare say I may have said a great many things which may be distasteful\r\nto my hon. friends, but I do claim their attention because at a time\r\nwhen they were not in such a dominant position as they are now,\r\nI pleaded for right and justice for them.  Therefore, they should not\r\ntake it amiss from me, because now they are in a dominant position,\r\nI plead also for justice, toleration, moderation, and delay in this matter.\r\n\r\nMR. H. MENTZ (Zoutpansberg) said the right hon. gentleman\r\nhad earned their gratitude for the high tone in which he had carried\r\nthe debate.  The speech which he had delivered was a most instructive one,\r\nand although the speaker was not in entire agreement with him on all points,\r\nhe was in agreement on the point that the matter was one to be handled\r\nwith prudence, but it was to be regretted that under the Bill\r\na Commission was to be appointed.  The Minister should not listen\r\nto the request for a postponement of the question, by referring it\r\nto a Select Committee.  If they were to refer the Bill to a Select Committee,\r\nit would never be passed this year.\r\n\r\nMR. G. L. STEYTLER (Rouxville) expressed his thanks to the Government\r\nfor bringing forward the Bill.  He said he felt that it was not\r\na complete solution of the whole question, but it was certainly\r\na step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nMR. A. FAWCUS (Umlazi) said that as the representative of 70,000 Natives\r\nin Natal, not one of whom so far as he knew had a vote, he should like,\r\non their behalf, to thank the right hon. member for Victoria West\r\nfor the manner in which he had handled this question.\r\nIn the course of his speech the right hon. gentleman asked,\r\nwhat did the Natives think about this Bill before the House?\r\nHis (Mr. Fawcus') opinion was that the Natives did not think anything at all\r\nabout it.  He should not think there was one Native in a thousand\r\nin South Africa who was aware that this matter, so vitally affecting\r\ntheir future, was at present at issue.  The hon. member for Middelburg\r\nhad referred to the Natives as \"schepsels\".*  He believed\r\nthe day was rapidly passing away when we should refer to Natives\r\nas \"schepsels\".  They were an easy-going folk, and they thought little\r\nabout title deeds and land laws.  So great was the Native's attachment\r\nto the land on which he lived, in many instances, that they could not\r\nrackrent him off it.  These were the people that the Bill wished\r\nto dispossess and drive off the land.  The figures placed before them\r\nshowed that THE LAND HELD BY EUROPEANS PER HEAD WAS FIFTY TIMES THE AMOUNT\r\nHELD PER HEAD BY THE NATIVES.  Surely there was no need at the present time\r\nfor legislation which would prevent Natives getting a little more land\r\nthan they now had.  He did not think it could be put down\r\nto the fault of the Native if he was willing to buy and live on land\r\nrather than pay rent.  The figures given in this connexion\r\nwere very instructive.  EIGHT ACRES PER HEAD WERE HELD BY THE NATIVES\r\nIN THE CAPE, SIX ACRES IN NATAL, ABOUT 1 1/2 ACRES in the Transvaal,\r\nand about one-third of an acre in the Free State.  He thought this Bill\r\nwas perhaps coming on a little before there was any necessity for it.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* Creatures.\r\n--\r\n\r\nMR. C. G. FICHARDT (Ladybrand) said he felt very much\r\nthat the Bill that was before the House did not carry out\r\nall that should be carried out, and that was equality of justice.\r\nIF THEY WERE TO DEAL FAIRLY WITH THE NATIVES OF THIS COUNTRY,\r\nTHEN ACCORDING TO POPULATION THEY SHOULD GIVE THEM FOUR-FIFTHS OF THE COUNTRY,\r\nOR AT LEAST A HALF.  How were they going to do that?  As he said\r\nin the earlier part of his remarks, he was prepared to accept the Bill\r\nas something to go on with, but he hoped that in the future\r\nit would not constitute a stumbling-block.  He would much rather have seen\r\nthat the matter had been gone into more fully, and that some scheme\r\nhad been laid before them so that they might have more readily been able\r\nto judge how the Bill would work.  It was because of all these difficulties\r\nthat he felt that they could only accept the Bill if it laid down\r\nthat there was no intention of taking the country from the white people\r\nand handing it over to the blacks.\r\n\r\nMR. J. G. KEYTER (Ficksburg) said he wished to openly denounce, and most\r\nemphatically so, that the people or the Government of the Orange Free State\r\nhad treated the coloured people unreasonably or unjustly,\r\nor in any way oppressively.  On the contrary, the O.F.S. had always treated\r\nthe coloured people with the greatest consideration and the utmost justice.\r\nThe O.F.S. had made what Mr. Merriman called stringent laws.\r\nHe (Mr. Keyter) called them just laws.  They TOLD THE COLOURED PEOPLE PLAINLY\r\nTHAT THE O.F.S. WAS A WHITE MAN'S COUNTRY, AND THAT THEY INTENDED\r\nTO KEEP IT SO.  (Hear, hear.)  THEY TOLD THE COLOURED PEOPLE\r\nTHAT THEY WERE NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO BUY OR HIRE LAND,\r\nand that they were not going to tolerate an equality of whites and blacks;\r\nand he said that they were not going to tolerate that in the future,\r\nand if an attempt were made to force that on them, they would resist it\r\nat any cost to the last,* for if they did tolerate it,\r\nthey would very soon find that they would be a bastard nation.\r\nHis experience was that the Native should be treated firmly,\r\nkept in his place and treated honestly.  They should not give him\r\na gun one day and fight him for it the next day.  They should tell him,\r\nas the Free State told him, that IT WAS A WHITE MAN'S COUNTRY,\r\nTHAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO BUY LAND THERE OR TO HIRE LAND THERE,\r\nAND THAT IF HE WANTED TO BE THERE HE MUST BE IN SERVICE.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* By passing the Bill, the Government conceded all the extravagant demands\r\n  of the \"Free\" Staters; yet, a year later they took up arms\r\n  against the Government.\r\n--\r\n\r\nMR. J. A. P. VAN DER MERWE (Vredefort) deprecated sending the Bill\r\nto a Select Committee, arguing that the House itself should decide it.\r\nHe referred to the difficulties experienced by farmers in the Free State.\r\nIf a farmer refused to allow a Native to farm on the share system\r\nhe simply refused to work.  There were thousands of Natives on the farms there\r\nwho hired ground and did little work.  The farmers had to keep their children\r\nat home to do the work.  Some of the Natives hired ground, did some sowing,\r\nthen went to work in Johannesburg, and paid the owner of the farm\r\nhalf what he reaped from the harvest.  That was not satisfactory.\r\nHe was pleased to see the provisions the Minister proposed to make\r\nin this regard, and expressed the hope that the Native\r\nwould only be tolerated among the whites as a labourer.  The Bill would meet\r\nwhat he considered a great want, and, as it was an urgent matter,\r\nhe hoped the proposal for a Select Committee would not be agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Third Reading Debate.\r\n\r\nSIR LIONEL PHILLIPS (Yeoville):  But why should a Bill of this sort\r\nbe brought before them now?  The Government in the past had not been bashful\r\nin the appointing of Commissions, and one question he would ask was why,\r\nin this important matter, the Government had not appointed a Commission\r\nto take all the evidence and then come to the House with a measure which\r\nthe House would have to approve of.  Instead of that, they were cancelling\r\nthe rights the Natives had in South Africa, and creating a very awkward hiatus\r\nbetween the time the Commission would be appointed and the time the Commission\r\ncould define the areas which would be regarded as white areas and the areas\r\nwhich would be regarded as native areas.  That was the one serious blot\r\nupon this measure.\r\n\r\nHe could see no justification, except that the hon. Minister,\r\nyielding to pressure from a certain section on that side of the House,\r\nhad hastily brought on this measure.  He thought from the speeches\r\nmade in the House it was the consensus of opinion that Natives\r\nshould not have farms in areas that were essentially white,\r\njust as it was desirable that white men should not be found in areas\r\nessentially native.  And especially when they told the native population\r\nthat they were taking away from them a right they had to-day,\r\nand they were going to substitute that right by appointing a Commission,\r\nthey were giving them very little justification for being satisfied\r\nwith this measure.  He did not think they were going to gain anything\r\nby putting the cart before the horse.  He did not know\r\nif Mr. Schreiner was accurate, but he told them that, roughly,\r\nin the Transvaal, where the matter was most acute, the Native population\r\nhad bought something like 12,000 or 15,000 morgen of land in twelve years.\r\nThat, he thought, showed there was no extreme urgency for the measure.\r\nTo that extent he agreed entirely with the hon. member, and he believed\r\nthe Minister would be well advised to send the Bill to a Select Committee,\r\nso that many of the details, which were extremely complicated and difficult,\r\nmight be thrashed out in that atmosphere, rather than on\r\nthe floor of the House.  (Opposition cheers.)\r\n\r\nMR. E. N. GROBLER (Edenburg) said:  The present was one of the best measures\r\nthat the Government had so far brought forward, and it appeared clear\r\nthat they had a Government which truly represented the wishes of the public.\r\nIt was impossible to delay the solution of the Native problem,\r\nand legislation on the subject had for a long time past been asked for.*\r\nAt the same time, he did not entirely agree with the methods,\r\nproposed to be applied, and he did not like the system of allocating reserves\r\nfor Natives.  When once those reserves had been allocated, would it not result\r\nin injury to agriculture and cattle breeding?  The farmers would suffer\r\nfrom lack of labour, and that deficiency would be a growing one.\r\nNeither could he agree to the principle of expropriation of land\r\nbelonging to whites in order to increase the size of the native reserves.\r\nHe considered the Bill was a complicated one.  The matter should be settled\r\nby way of taxation, in the following way.  All Natives who\r\nwere in the service of whites should be exempted from taxation,\r\nand treated as well as possible, and other Natives should be encouraged\r\nto take similar service.  There were enormous reserves where the Natives\r\ncould go and live,** and if they refused to go there they should be required\r\nto pay a stiff tax.  Then they would go and work for white people.\r\nThe hon. member for Tembuland had offered many objections to the Bill.\r\nThey should make that hon. member king of Tembuland.\r\nIn a country of the blind a man with one eye would be king.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* By a \"solution of the Native problem\", \"Free\" State farmers generally mean\r\n  the re-establishment of slavery.\r\n** It will be observed that these and similar mythological disquisitions\r\n   subsequently formed General Botha's assurances to Mr. Harcourt.\r\n   See Chapter XVI.  But some light is thrown on the subject\r\n   of these visionary Native Reserves by Mr. Fawcus' speech\r\n   based on official statistics (page 36 [above -- last Fawcus quote]).\r\n--\r\n\r\nMR. P. DUNCAN (Fordsburg) said he hoped the Minister would not take\r\nthe view of the last speaker.  Under the Bill it would be possible\r\nfor farmers to accumulate on their land as many Natives as they could get,\r\nso long as they could use them as servants.  (Labour cheers.)\r\nSo far as he could see, even if it were carried out to the extent\r\nthat it was proposed to go, it would not very much reduce the social contact\r\nwhich at present existed between whites and natives.\r\n\r\nSIR W. B. BERRY (Queenstown) said he would like to know why the Minister\r\nhad run away from the Bill that had passed the second reading,\r\nand now tabled another Bill in the shape of many amendments.\r\nOne would naturally complain that, seeing that they had in that House\r\na Native Affairs Committee, a non-party committee, specially chosen\r\nto consider all matters relating to native affairs, that Bill,\r\nwhich was a most important matter and dealt with native affairs from A to Z,\r\nshould have been referred to that committee.  The same thing\r\nhappened last session in reference to a Bill the Minister of Native Affairs\r\nkept on the paper until nearly the end of the session, and the House\r\nhad to take the very unusual step almost on the last day of moving\r\nthat committee proceedings on that Bill be taken that day six months.\r\nHe (Sir W. B. Berry) proposed to move a similar amendment\r\nto the motion now before the House.  In the remarks he addressed\r\nwhen the Bill came up for second reading he had ventured to say\r\nthat there was no call for a bill of that nature at all;\r\nthere was no need for a Bill revolutionizing the attitude of the Union\r\nwith respect to the natives generally.  The only clue they could get\r\nto the reason why the Bill was introduced was that a few die-hards\r\non the other side of the House had given the Minister to understand that\r\nunless he brought in a Bill of that kind, or of a similarly drastic nature,\r\nthe position of the Government was in danger.  He hoped\r\nsome of these die-hards would come forward that evening\r\nand tell them plainly and bluntly why they wanted that Bill,\r\nwhy they were going to thrust it on the country without any notice,\r\nand why they were calling on the House to revolutionize\r\nthe whole tenour and the whole order of things in regard to land matters\r\nas far as the Natives were concerned.  Proceeding, the hon. member said\r\nthe only justification that had been offered for this Bill was that\r\na large amount of land had been transferred from Europeans to Natives.\r\nAn analysis of the return, however, showed that only sixteen farms\r\nin the Transvaal had been so transferred during the last three years.\r\nSurely that was not any justification why the European people of the Union\r\nshould get into a panic and why the administration of the day\r\nwere seeking to place on the Statute Book this most drastic legislation.\r\nAnother reason why he objected to this Bill was that it purported to appoint\r\na Commission to investigate to what extent and in what parts and in what time\r\nland should be selected by the Commission for the purpose of being reserved\r\nas additional native areas within the Union.  They were not given\r\nany guarantee that the Commission was going to be appointed\r\nnor any guarantee that it would ever report, but at the same time\r\nwhilst these indefinite assurances were attempted to be given to the House\r\nthere was no getting over this fact, that there was no time limit in the Bill\r\nby which the real enacting clause in the Bill was to have any cessation.\r\nWhen he spoke on this Bill before he supported it only on the understanding\r\nthat a time limit was to be put in, or that it should be an annual Bill.\r\nHe said unhesitatingly that the whole tendency of the Bill,\r\nas it stood at the second reading, and more especially as it stood\r\nwith the amendments by the Minister on the notice paper,\r\nwas to drive the Native peasant off the land.  The only refuge\r\nthat that Native had was the town.\r\n\r\nThe country had not been prepared in any way for a Bill of this kind.\r\nA cry had been heard throughout the land against the iniquities\r\nproposed in the Bill.  If it had been found absolutely necessary\r\nthat legislation of this kind should be introduced, the least\r\nthat could be expected was that ample time should be given to the Natives\r\nto thoroughly acquire a knowledge of the contents of the measure.\r\nThat opportunity had not been given them, and in this respect\r\nthere was a very serious grievance.  For the good order and peace of the Union\r\nthere was a very great danger ahead.  He had understood from those\r\nwell versed in native affairs that one of the greatest dangers\r\nthat could threaten us was to give the Natives anything\r\nin the shape of a common grievance.  Divide and rule had been\r\na wise precaution in the government of the Natives.  When a common grievance\r\nwas found by four or five million people one could understand how great\r\nthat grievance must be.  One amendment the Minister had put on the paper\r\nmust give serious pause.  The late Minister of Native Affairs\r\nissued to members last session a Squatters Bill.  The greatest objection\r\nto that measure, and one which he thought led to its withdrawal,\r\nwas that it proposed to remove thousands upon thousands of natives\r\nfrom land which they had been in the occupation of for scores of years.\r\nIt was in consequence of the disturbance which that Bill caused\r\nthroughout the Union that it was withdrawn.  In one of the amendments\r\non the paper the present Minister of Native Affairs brought back\r\nin a somewhat clandestine manner the most objectionable feature of the Bill\r\nthat was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker:  The amendment is not yet before the House.\r\n\r\nSIR W. B. BERRY:  What Bill is it then that is to go into Committee?\r\n(Hear, hear.)  Is it the Bill which was read a second time\r\nor the Bill comprised in the Minister's amendments?  He moved that the House\r\ngo into committee on the Bill this day six months.\r\n\r\nMR. T. L. SCHREINER (Tembuland), in seconding the amendment,\r\nsaid that sufficient notice had not been given of the provisions of the Bill,\r\nalthough the Natives, thanks to the time which had elapsed\r\nsince the second reading, were better acquainted with the measure\r\nthan they were a little while ago.\r\n\r\nMr. Schreiner proceeded to quote opinions from native newspapers on the Bill.\r\nThe `Tsala ea Batho', of Kimberley, said:  \"We are standing on the brink\r\nof the precipice.  We appealed to certain members of Parliament against\r\nthe suspension clause in Mr. Sauer's Land Bill, and the result of our appeal\r\nhas been an agreement between Sir Thomas Smartt and the Minister\r\nto the effect that the first part of the Bill only be proceeded with.\r\nThe effect of this agreement is infinitely worse than the whole Bill.\r\nIn its entirety, there were certain saving clauses, one of them\r\npractically excluding the Cape Province from the operation of the Bill.\r\nUnder the present agreement, all these clauses are dropped,\r\nand section 1 of the Bill, which prohibits the sale of land\r\nbetween Europeans and Natives (pending the report of a future Commission)\r\nis applicable to all parts of the Union, including the Cape Province.\r\nNow, then, if this suspension clause becomes law, what is going to happen?\r\nIt is simply this:  That the whole land policy of the Union of South Africa\r\nis the land policy of the Orange Free State, and it will be as difficult\r\nto abrogate that suspension as it is difficult to recall a bullet,\r\nonce fired through some one's head, and resuscitate the victim.\r\nOur object then should be to prevent the pistol being fired off,\r\nas prevention is infinitely better than cure.\"  One paper\r\nthat he was quoting from was (Mr. Schreiner went on to say) pleased,\r\nbecause it believed that this Bill was going to Select Committee.\r\nThere was another native paper, published in Natal, which acknowledged\r\nthe efforts which the missionaries had made on behalf of the Natives\r\nin regard to this Bill.  There was a native paper, published at Dundee,\r\nwhich said that, if the Bill were in the interests of the Natives,\r\nand the Government were actuated by a sincere regard for them,\r\nthey would not have hesitated to publish it broadcast, instead of being\r\nin such haste to push the matter through the House.*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* All efforts to induce the South African Government to circulate\r\n  translations of the Natives' Land Act among the Natives of the Union\r\n  have proved fruitless.  -- Author.\r\n--\r\n\r\nMr. Schreiner (continuing) referred to the resolution passed\r\nby the Natal Missionary Conference, and the views expressed\r\nby the Chairman of the Transvaal Missionary Conference in opposition\r\nto the Bill.  He mentioned that it had been decided in Johannesburg\r\nto call a meeting of missionary societies throughout the Union,\r\nto determine what action could be taken in case clause 1 was proceeded with.\r\nHe had also received a telegram from the Witwatersrand Church Council,\r\nstating that a telegram had been sent to the Minister strongly protesting\r\nagainst section 1 being enacted before the proposed Commission\r\nhad thoroughly investigated the whole question of alternative areas.\r\nMr. Schreiner urged that, if they proceeded with this Bill,\r\nand passed clause 1 of the old Bill, and appointed a Commission,\r\nthese restrictions with regard to purchase and sale, which the Natives\r\nhad feared, and which the missionaries, on behalf of the Natives,\r\nfeared and protested against, would become a fact.  For that reason,\r\nhe said they should rather put off the Bill.\r\n\r\nEvery one was feeling the pressure of their legislative duties.  Was this\r\nthe time, therefore, for passing a measure of such a far-reaching character,\r\nand where every clause demanded the most careful consideration and scrutiny?\r\nWas it the right thing because he had a majority at his back\r\nfor the Minister to say that they must get this Bill through this session?\r\nHe held that this was not right.  It was not fair to those who had\r\nthe solution of the question at heart.  (Cheers.)\r\n\r\nSIR E. H. WALTON (Port Elizabeth, Central) said he entirely supported\r\nthe amendment of the hon. member for Queen's Town.  He had a telegram\r\nfrom a mass meeting of Natives held in Port Elizabeth, in which they hoped\r\nthat the House would postpone decision on this question until the Commission\r\nhad sat and reported.  That seemed to him an entirely reasonable request,\r\nand it seemed all the more necessary that this should be done\r\non account of the very large alterations that it had been found necessary\r\nto make in the Bill.\r\n\r\nThey had native protests from all parts of South Africa against this measure,\r\nand when one saw what was proposed in this Act, they could not wonder\r\nat these protests.  (Hear, hear.)  Therefore he put it that these protests\r\nshould receive fair consideration from members on all sides of the House.\r\nLegislation of this kind was unfortunate from the point of view\r\nof the Natives.  The more intelligent of the Natives in this country\r\nwere asking for time.  They said:  \"You are putting this thing upon us,\r\ngive us time to consider it.  Allow this Commission to get to work,\r\nallow this Commission to put before us the provisions you are going to make\r\nfor us, and when this is done we will submit to anything that is fair.\"\r\nNo man, and the Native was just a man like the rest of us,\r\nliked the old arrangements to be disturbed, because it upset him,\r\nand the Native might oppose it, because he was frightened.\r\nThey must admit that they had not given the native leaders and chiefs\r\nan opportunity to come down to Cape Town and give their views.\r\nIt was unfortunate that this measure had been more or less rushed.\r\nThere was no mention of it in the Governor-General's speech, and therefore\r\nthe Natives were not prepared for the consideration of the question.\r\n\r\nMR. M. ALEXANDER (Cape Town, Castle) said he was still of opinion\r\nthat a very dangerous principle was introduced in the Bill,\r\nespecially so far as the Cape was concerned.  In the speech\r\ndelivered by the Governor-General at the opening of the session\r\nthere was not the slightest reference to the present measure,\r\nwhich apparently had been brought in as an afterthought, and something\r\nmust have occurred after the Governor-General's speech was delivered,\r\notherwise one could not conceive of such an important Bill being omitted\r\nfrom the speech.  As it was the Bill would simply hang things up\r\nuntil the Commission reported, and now the House would be legislating\r\nin the dark.  The vast majority of Natives had declared themselves\r\nto be against the Bill.  He had had no desire whatever that party capital\r\nshould be made out of the measure -- (hear, hear) -- but he desired\r\nto see a measure which would bear the mark of statesmanship,\r\nand not of panic and hurry.  Their Commission could report\r\nbefore next session, and then in the early stages of the session\r\na Bill could be introduced and be adopted on its merits.\r\nIn the interests of South Africa, in the interests of the Natives,\r\nand in the interests of just legislation let the Government withdraw the Bill,\r\nand appoint a Commission, and then justice and not injustice would be done.\r\n(Hear, hear.)\r\n\r\nDR. A. H. WATKINS (Barkly) said that there was a tacit understanding\r\nthat the Minister would refer this Bill, if he were not prepared\r\nto accept a purely temporary measure, to a Select Committee.\r\nDuring the three years of the Union Parliament every matter\r\npractically dealing with Natives had been brought before\r\nthe Select Committee on Native Affairs and their opinion had been asked.\r\nFor some reason, which it was difficult for him to understand,\r\nthe Minister had not seen fit to carry out that course.\r\nSixteen days had elapsed since the second reading of this Bill was taken\r\non which the Select Committee could have sat morning after morning\r\nand dealt with the Bill.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of passing only a temporary measure instead of appearing\r\nto pass a measure which would permanently deal with this question,\r\nwas more evident to-night than when they took the second reading.\r\n\r\nMR. H. M. MEYLER (Weenen) said that he would support\r\nthe motion of Sir Bisset Berry.  He thought it would be\r\na great injustice to the Natives, and especially the Natives of Natal,\r\nwho really knew nothing of this measure, to force it through now.\r\nSince the second reading, his attention had been drawn to certain provisions\r\nin this Bill, which made it more dangerous still to hurry legislation,\r\nbecause he found that, although there was an exemption in the Bill as regarded\r\nagreements lawfully entered into, the vast majority of the agreements\r\nat present in force amongst the Natives of Natal were not strictly lawful,\r\naccording to their Statute law.  As they had no less than 380,000 Natives\r\nsquatting on private lands in Natal, according to the Minister's own figures,\r\nit would be a fatal mistake to do anything to upset these people,\r\nuntil they had something ready to provide for them instead.\r\nThe difficulty was that under the Natal law no oral contract was binding\r\nfor more than twelve months, and many of those squatters\r\nhad not got oral contracts, but were more or less on sufferance on the farms.\r\nIt would be a great danger to pass legislation which would lead to\r\nthe moving of a large portion of these people before they got an inch of land\r\nprovided for their use.  He objected to legislation being brought forward\r\ntoo hurriedly, and when they had got 4 1/2 millions of Natives, only an\r\ninfinitesimal portion of whom could possibly know the nature of the Bill,\r\nand seeing that it affected them as well as the white population,\r\nthey had a perfect right to have it explained to them\r\nby the Government officials and let their members of Parliament\r\nfor the divisions in which they lived give their opinions on the question.\r\nThat would take months, and it was impossible to get a proper\r\nopinion of the Natives until hon. members had been away from the House\r\nfor some time.  The Right Hon. the Prime Minister admitted\r\nthey should stand as the guardians of the Natives, and admitted\r\nthat they should go slowly, and he hoped the hon. Minister would be willing\r\nto reconsider the Bill and allow it to be put off, and let them have\r\nan interim report, at any rate, from the Commission, before they were asked\r\nto pass legislation in that matter.\r\n==\r\n\r\nThe Bill was contested at every stage and numerous divisions were challenged.\r\nIn each instance, the Speaker would put the Question, and the \"steam-roller\"\r\nwould go to work with the inevitable result.  The division lists ranged\r\nfrom 17 against 71 to 32 against 60, the majority in each case\r\nbeing in favour of repression.  It would be just as well\r\nto give at least one of these division lists.  The English names\r\nin the majority are those of some Natal members (Ministerialists)\r\nor representatives of purely Dutch constituencies: --\r\n\r\n\r\n    DIVISION\r\n\r\nDr. A. H.

Amos Burnet\r\n                                       (Chairman and General Superintendent of\r\n                                       the Transvaal and Swazieland District,\r\n                                       Wesleyan Methodist Church).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to now we have dealt with the history of the Land Act\r\nfrom its commencement, and all the speeches and official documents\r\nwe have mentioned hitherto say nothing about restricting Europeans\r\nin their ownership of land.  And no matter what other principles\r\none might read into the Act, it would be found that the principles\r\nunderlying it were those of extending the \"Free\" State land laws\r\nthroughout the Union -- an extension by which Natives would be prohibited\r\nfrom investing their earnings in land whereon they could end their days\r\nin peace.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be good reason for believing that the Government were advised,\r\nby the legal advisers of the Crown, that the Natives' Land Bill\r\nwould be class legislation of a kind that would never be allowed\r\nby His Majesty's Government.  The originators of the Bill, however,\r\nwere determined so to circumvent the constitutional quibble\r\nraised by the legal advisers as to seal our doom; and by adroitly manipulating\r\nits legal phrases, it seems that it was recasted in such a manner\r\nas to give it a semblance of a paper restriction on European encroachment\r\non native rights.  But class legislation the Act is, for whereas\r\nin his travels about South Africa, since the passing of this Act,\r\nthe author has met many a native family with their stock,\r\nturned out by the Act upon the roads, he never met one white man so hounded\r\nby the same Act, and debarred from living where he pleased.\r\n\r\nThe squatters form a particular section of the community specifically affected\r\nby the Land Act; and there is no such person in South Africa\r\nas a white squatter.  Although it is insistently affirmed that the law applies\r\nboth to Europeans and Natives, the conclusion cannot be avoided that\r\nit is directed exclusively against the Native.  This is the naked truth that\r\nturns all other explanations of the fact into mere shuffling and juggling.\r\nAnd the reader will find that in Section 11, at the end of the statute\r\nwhich is here reproduced (whether the omission of Europeans\r\nwas a mistake of the Parliamentary draftsmen, or the printers, we know not),\r\nit is expressly stated that \"this Act may be cited for all purposes\r\nas the NATIVES' Land Act, 1913.\"  Who, then, will continue to argue\r\nthat it was intended for Europeans as well?\r\n\r\n==\r\nNo. 27, 1913.]\r\n\r\n                                      ACT\r\n                                      TO\r\nMake further provision as to the purchase and leasing of Land\r\n  by Natives and other Persons in the several parts of the Union and for\r\n  other purposes in connection with the ownership and occupation of Land\r\n  by Natives and other Persons.\r\n\r\nBe it enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty,\r\nthe Senate and the House of Assembly of the Union of South Africa,\r\nas follows: --\r\n\r\n1.

This Act may be cited for all purposes as the Natives' Land Act, 1913.\r\n==\r\n\r\nThe foregoing result of a legislative jumble is \"the law\",\r\nand this law, like Alexander the coppersmith, \"hath done us much harm\".\r\nMr. Sauer carried his Bill less by reason than by sheer force of numbers,\r\nand partly by promises which he afterwards broke.  Among these broken promises\r\nwas the definite assurance he gave Parliament that the Bill\r\nwould be referred to the Select Committee on Native Affairs,\r\nso that the Natives, who are not represented in Parliament,\r\ntheir European friends and the Missionary bodies on behalf of the Natives,\r\ncould be able at the proper time to appear before this committee and state\r\nany objection which they might have to the Bill.  But when that time came,\r\nthe Minister flatly refused to refer it to the committee.\r\nThis change of front is easily explained, because the weight of evidence\r\nwhich could have been given before any Parliamentary committee\r\nwould have imperilled the passage of the Bill.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, the debate on the Bill created the greatest alarm\r\namongst the native population, for they had followed its course\r\nwith the keenest interest.  Nothing short of a declaration of war against them\r\ncould have created a similar excitement, although the hope was entertained\r\nin some quarters, that a body of men like the Ministerialists in Parliament\r\n(a majority of whom are never happier than when attesting\r\nthe Christian character of their race) would in course of days\r\nattend the Holy Communion, remember the 11th Commandment,\r\nand do unto others as they would that men should do unto them.\r\nOur people, in fact a number of them, said amongst themselves\r\nthat even Dutchmen sing Psalms -- all the Psalms, including the 24th;\r\nand, believing as they did that Dutchmen could have no other religion\r\nbesides the one recommended in the New Testament and preached by\r\nthe predikants of the Dutch Reformed Church, were prepared\r\nto commend their safety to the influence of that sweet and peaceable religion.\r\nHowever, some other Natives, remembering what took place before\r\nthe South African war, took a different view of these religious incidents.\r\nThose Natives, especially of the old Republics, knew that\r\nthe only dividing fence between the Transvaal Natives and complete slavery\r\nwas the London Convention; they, therefore, now that the London Convention\r\nin fact had ceased to exist, had evil forebodings regarding\r\nthe average Republican's treatment of the Natives, which was seldom influenced\r\nby religious scruples, and they did not hesitate to express their fears.\r\n\r\nPersonally we must say that if any one had told us at the beginning of 1913,\r\nthat a majority of members of the Union Parliament were capable of passing\r\na law like the Natives' Land Act, whose object is to prevent the Natives\r\nfrom ever rising above the position of servants to the whites,\r\nwe would have regarded that person as a fit subject for the lunatic asylum.\r\nBut the passing of that Act and its operation have rudely\r\nforced the fact upon us that the Union Parliament is capable of producing\r\nany measure that is subversive of native interests; and that\r\nthe complete arrest of native progress is the object aimed at\r\nin their efforts to include the Protectorates in their Union.\r\nThus we think that their sole reason for seeking to incorporate Basutoland,\r\nSwaziland and Bechuanaland is that, when they have definitely eliminated\r\nthe Imperial factor from South Africa, as they are unmistakably trying to do,\r\nthey may have a million more slaves than if the Protectorates were excluded.\r\n\r\nIn this connexion, the realization of the prophecy of an old Basuto\r\nbecame increasingly believable to us.  It was to this effect, namely:\r\n\"That the Imperial Government, after conquering the Boers,\r\nhanded back to them their old Republics, and a nice little present\r\nin the shape of the Cape Colony and Natal -- the two English Colonies.\r\nThat the Boers are now ousting the Englishmen from the public service,\r\nand when they have finished with them, they will make a law\r\ndeclaring it a crime for a Native to live in South Africa,\r\nunless he is a servant in the employ of a Boer, and that from this\r\nit will be just one step to complete slavery.\"  This is being realized,\r\nfor to-day we have, extended throughout the Union of South Africa,\r\na \"Free\" State law which makes it illegal for Natives\r\nto live on farms except as servants in the employ of Europeans.\r\nThere is another \"Free\" State law, under which no Native\r\nmay live in a municipal area or own property in urban localities.\r\nHe can only live in town as a servant in the employ of a European.\r\nAnd if the followers of General Hertzog are permitted\r\nto dragoon the Union Government into enforcing \"Free\" State ideals\r\nagainst the Natives of the Union, as they have successfully done\r\nunder the Natives' Land Act, it will only be a matter of time\r\nbefore we have a Natives' Urban Act enforced throughout South Africa.\r\nThen we will have the banner of slavery fully unfurled (of course,\r\nunder another name) throughout the length and breadth of the land.\r\n\r\nWhen the Natives' Land Bill was before Parliament, meetings were held\r\nin many villages and locations in protest against the Ministerial surrender\r\nto the Republicans, of which the Bill was the outcome.\r\nAt the end of March, 1913, the Native National Congress met in Johannesburg,\r\nand there a deputation was appointed to go to Capetown\r\nand point out to the Government some, at least, of the harm\r\nthat would follow legislation of the character mapped out in Parliament\r\non February 28 when the Land Act was first announced.  They were to urge\r\nthat such a measure would be exploitation of the cruelest kind, that it\r\nwould not only interfere with the economic independence of the Natives,\r\nbut would reduce them for ever to a state of serfdom, and degrade them\r\nas nothing has done since slavery was abolished at the Cape.\r\nMissionaries also, and European friends of the Natives, did not sit still.\r\nResolution after resolution, telegraphic and other representations,\r\nwere made to Mr. Sauer, from meetings in various parts of the country,\r\ncounselling prudence.  Even such societies as the Transvaal Landowners,\r\nwho had long been crying for a measure to separate whites from blacks,\r\nand vice versa, urged that the Bill should not be passed during\r\nthe same session in which it was introduced, that the country should be given\r\nan opportunity to digest it, in order, if necessary, to suggest amendments.\r\nThe Missionary bodies, too, represent a following of Natives\r\nnumbering hundreds of thousands of souls, on whose behalf\r\nthey pleaded for justice.  These bodies urged that before passing a law,\r\nprohibiting the sale and lease of land to Natives, and expelling squatters\r\nfrom their homes, the Government should provide locations\r\nto which the evicted Natives could go.  But all these representations\r\nmade no impression upon the Government, who, instead, preferred to act\r\nupon the recommendation of thirteen diminutive petitions\r\n(signed in all by 304 Dutchmen in favour of the Bill)* than to be guided\r\nby the overwhelming weight of public opinion that was against its passage.\r\nThus it became clear that the Native's position in his own country\r\nwas not an enviable one, for once a law was made prohibiting\r\nthe sale of landed property to Natives, it would be almost impossible\r\nto get a South African Parliament to amend it.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* One of these thirteen petitions had only four signatures,\r\n  which was but one better than that of the Tooley Street tailors.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe Government, which at the beginning assured Parliament of their\r\nhumane intentions, proceeded to delete the mildest clauses of the measure\r\nand to insert some very harsh ones; and almost each time\r\nthat the Bill came before the House, one or two fresh drastic clauses\r\nwere added.  But it is comforting to note that even Parliament\r\nwas not entirely satisfied with this, its heroic piece of legislation.\r\nThus Mr. Meyler of Natal did, as only a lawyer could with a view\r\nto recasting the Bill, some very useful work in pointing out\r\nthe possible harm with which the Bill was fraught.  We wish that\r\nhis clever speeches and observations (much of which have come true),\r\nmight yet be sifted out of the big Parliamentary Reports,\r\nand published in a concise little pamphlet.\r\n\r\nSir David Hunter, another member of Natal, expressed himself as follows: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nWhile every one seemed animated with a desire to do what was right and just\r\nto the Natives, there was a feeling that certain of the details of the measure\r\nrequired amendment.  He was more than pleased when the Minister\r\nclosed the debate by a speech in which he seemed to be willing to meet\r\nthe wishes of those in the House who thought that amendment was required.\r\nHe could not have imagined that the Bill would develop into the shape\r\ninto which it had developed, and had he known that so great an alteration\r\nwould take place in the general effect of the measure\r\nfrom what was foreshadowed by the hon. Minister when he had made\r\nthat interesting speech on the second reading he (the speaker)\r\ncould not have conscientiously voted for the second reading.\r\nHe would have been better pleased had a resolution been taken\r\nnot to bring in a Bill until the Commission had reported.\r\nThat was the position he had taken up all through and he would much rather now\r\nthat the matter should be dealt with in that way.  If, however,\r\nthe Bill was to be pressed through there should be guarantees in it\r\nwhich should allay all suspicion.  Anything affecting the native people\r\nrequired to be done gradually and should be placed before them\r\na long time before the change took place.  He hoped there would yet be\r\nsome steps taken to give them a greater sense of security.\r\nTo give some idea of the feeling in the minds of the Natives\r\nhe read a letter from a gentleman in Natal, largely interested\r\nin the Natives, which had expressed the opinion that the Natives\r\nstood uncompromisingly against any change in their present status\r\nuntil the Commission had reported.  He hoped the hon. Minister\r\nwould even yet endeavour to do something to meet their views.\r\n\r\nMr. C. H. Haggar (Roodepoort) said that from the point of those\r\nwho had worked successfully in turning the uncivilized man\r\ninto the civilized man the Bill was bound to be a failure.\r\nIt was necessary not only to have legislation theoretically just,\r\nbut also practically right and good.  But there were many who felt\r\nthat so far from the effect of that Bill being good it would be disastrous\r\nto a very large extent.  The great sin which they had been committing\r\nwas that they had always been legislating ahead of the people,\r\nand there had not been sufficient preparation for the changes\r\nwhich were proposed in that Bill; the Natives were not ready for it.\r\nThe hon. member for Victoria West had said that there was a disposition\r\nin certain directions to repress the Natives.  He (the speaker) believed\r\nthat there was a feeling that white men had some divine right\r\nto the labour of the black, that the black people were to be\r\nhewers of wood and drawers of water, and he wanted to say that while men\r\nwere obsessed with that feeling they would never be able to legislate fairly.\r\nThey had no more divine right to the labour of the black people\r\nthan they had to the labour of the white.  To his mind the great point was,\r\nshould their policy be one of repression or a policy of inspiration?\r\nThey had inspired the Natives to a certain extent, but no sooner\r\nhad they created an appetite than they had told the Natives\r\nthey should go no further.  Their policy was the policy of Tantalus.\r\nThat Bill would create a feeling of insecurity in the minds of the Natives.\r\nThere were those who said that if the Natives would not submit to dictation\r\nthey should be wiped out.  But that should not be their policy.\r\nThey must cease the policy of repression and let it be\r\none of wide inspiration.\r\n==\r\n\r\nBut alas! these and similar pleadings had about as much effect\r\nupon the Ministerial steam-roller as the proverbial water on a duck's back.\r\nWith a rush the Natives' Land Bill was dispatched from the Lower House\r\nto the Senate, adopted hurriedly by the Senate, returned to the Lower House,\r\nand went at the same pace to Government House, and there receiving\r\nthe Governor-General's signature, it immediately became law.\r\nAs regards the Governor-General's signature, His Excellency,\r\nif Ministers are to be believed, was ready to sign the Bill\r\n(or rather signified his intention of doing so) long before it was introduced\r\ninto Parliament.  This excited haste suggests grave misgivings\r\nas to the character of the Bill.  Why all the hurry and scurry,\r\nand why the Governor-General's approval in advance?  Other Bills\r\nare passed and approved by the Governor, yet they do not come into operation\r\nuntil some given day -- the beginning of the next calendar year,\r\nor of the next financial year.  But the Natives' Land Act\r\nbecame law and was operating as soon as it could be promulgated.\r\n\r\nAfter desperately protesting, with individual members of Parliament\r\nand with Cabinet Ministers, and getting nothing for their pains,\r\nthe delegates from the Native Congress wrote Lord Gladstone,\r\nfrom an office about two hundred yards distant from Government House,\r\nrequesting His Excellency to withhold his assent to the Natives' Land Bill\r\nuntil the people mostly concerned (i.e. the Natives) had had a chance\r\nof making known to His Majesty the King their objection to the measure.\r\nHis Excellency replied that such a course \"was not within\r\nhis constitutional functions.\"  Thereby the die was cast,\r\nand the mandate went forth that the land laws of the Orange \"Free\" State,\r\nwhich is commonly known as \"the Only Slave State\", shall be\r\nthe laws of the whole Union of South Africa.  The worst feature in the case\r\nis the fact that, even with the Governments of the late Republics,\r\nthe Presidents always had the power to exempt some Natives\r\nfrom the operation of those laws, and that prerogative had been liberally used\r\nby successive Presidents.  Now, however, without a President,\r\nand with the prerogative of the King (by the exercise of which\r\nthe evils of such a law could have been averted) disowned by\r\nthe King's own Ministers on the spot, God in the heavens alone\r\nknows what will become of the hapless, because voteless, Natives,\r\nwho are without a President, \"without a King\", and with a Governor-General\r\nwithout constitutional functions, under task-masters whose national traditions\r\nare to enslave the dark races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV      One Night with the Fugitives\r\n\r\n  Es ist unkoeniglich zu weinen -- ach,\r\n  Und hier nicht weinen ist unvaeterlich.\r\n                                       Schiller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Pray that your flight be not in winter,\" said Jesus Christ;\r\nbut it was only during the winter of 1913 that the full significance\r\nof this New Testament passage was revealed to us.  We left Kimberley\r\nby the early morning train during the first week in July,\r\non a tour of observation regarding the operation of the Natives' Land Act;\r\nand we arrived at Bloemhof, in Transvaal, at about noon.\r\nOn the River Diggings there were no actual cases representing\r\nthe effects of the Act, but traces of these effects were everywhere manifest.\r\nSome fugitives of the Natives' Land Act had crossed the river in full flight.\r\nThe fact that they reached the diggings a fortnight before our visit\r\nwould seem to show that while the debates were proceeding in Parliament\r\nsome farmers already viewed with eager eyes the impending opportunity\r\nfor at once making slaves of their tenants and appropriating their stock;\r\nfor, acting on the powers conferred on them by an Act signed\r\nby Lord Gladstone, so lately as June 16, they had during that very week\r\n(probably a couple of days after, and in some cases, it would seem,\r\na couple of days before the actual signing of the Bill)\r\napproached their tenants with stories about a new Act which makes it criminal\r\nfor any one to have black tenants and lawful to have black servants.\r\nFew of these Natives, of course, would object to be servants,\r\nespecially if the white man is worth working for, but this is where\r\nthe shoe pinches:  one of the conditions is that the black man's\r\n(that is the servant's) cattle shall henceforth work for the landlord\r\nfree of charge.  Then the Natives would decide to leave the farm\r\nrather than make the landlord a present of all their life's savings,\r\nand some of them had passed through the diggings in search of a place\r\nin the Transvaal.  But the higher up they went the more gloomy\r\nwas their prospect as the news about the new law was now penetrating\r\nevery part of the country.\r\n\r\nOne farmer met a wandering native family in the town of Bloemhof\r\na week before our visit.  He was willing to employ the Native\r\nand many more homeless families as follows:  A monthly wage\r\nof 2 Pounds 10s. for each such family, the husband working in the fields,\r\nthe wife in the house, with an additional 10s. a month for each son,\r\nand 5s. for each daughter, but on condition that the Native's cattle\r\nwere also handed over to work for him.  It must be clearly understood,\r\nwe are told that the Dutchman added, that occasionally the Native\r\nwould have to leave his family at work on the farm, and go out\r\nwith his wagon and his oxen to earn money whenever and wherever\r\nhe was told to go, in order that the master may be enabled to pay\r\nthe stipulated wage.  The Natives were at first inclined to laugh at the idea\r\nof working for a master with their families and goods and chattels,\r\nand then to have the additional pleasure of paying their own small wages,\r\nbesides bringing money to pay the \"Baas\" for employing them.\r\nBut the Dutchman's serious demeanour told them that his suggestion\r\nwas \"no joke\".  He himself had for some time been in need\r\nof a native cattle owner, to assist him as transport rider\r\nbetween Bloemhof, Mooifontein, London, and other diggings,\r\nin return for the occupation and cultivation of some of his waste lands\r\nin the district, but that was now illegal.  He could only \"employ\" them;\r\nbut, as he had no money to pay wages, their cattle would have\r\nto go out and earn it for him.  Had they not heard of the law before?\r\nhe inquired.  Of course they had; in fact that is why they left\r\nthe other place, but as they thought that it was but a \"Free\" State law,\r\nthey took the anomalous situation for one of the multifarious aspects\r\nof the freedom of the \"Free\" State whence they came; they had scarcely thought\r\nthat the Transvaal was similarly afflicted.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say the Natives did not see their way to agree\r\nwith such a one-sided bargain.  They moved up country, but only to find\r\nthe next farmer offering the same terms, however, with a good many more\r\ndisturbing details -- and the next farmer and the next --\r\nso that after this native farmer had wandered from farm to farm,\r\noccasionally getting into trouble for travelling with unknown stock,\r\n\"across my ground without my permission\", and at times\r\nescaping arrest for he knew not what, and further, being abused\r\nfor the crimes of having a black skin and no master, he sold some of his stock\r\nalong the way, beside losing many which died of cold and starvation;\r\nand after thus having lost much of his substance, he eventually worked his way\r\nback to Bloemhof with the remainder, sold them for anything they could fetch,\r\nand went to work for a digger.\r\n\r\nThe experience of another native sufferer was similar to the above,\r\nexcept that instead of working for a digger he sold his stock\r\nfor a mere bagatelle, and left with his family by the Johannesburg night train\r\nfor an unknown destination.  More native families crossed the river\r\nand went inland during the previous week, and as nothing had since\r\nbeen heard of them, it would seem that they were still wandering somewhere,\r\nand incidentally becoming well versed in the law that was responsible\r\nfor their compulsory unsettlement.\r\n\r\nWell, we knew that this law was as harsh as its instigators were callous,\r\nand we knew that it would, if passed, render many poor people homeless,\r\nbut it must be confessed that we were scarcely prepared\r\nfor such a rapid and widespread crash as it caused in the lives of the Natives\r\nin this neighbourhood.  We left our luggage the next morning\r\nwith the local Mission School teacher, and crossed the river\r\nto find out some more about this wonderful law of extermination.\r\nIt was about 10 a.m. when we landed on the south bank of the Vaal River --\r\nthe picturesque Vaal River, upon whose banks a hundred miles farther west\r\nwe spent the best and happiest days of our boyhood.  It was interesting\r\nto walk on one portion of the banks of that beautiful river --\r\na portion which we had never traversed except as an infant in mother's arms\r\nmore than thirty years before.  How the subsequent happy days at Barkly West,\r\nso long past, came crowding upon our memory! -- days when\r\nthere were no railways, no bridges, and no system of irrigation.\r\nIn rainy seasons, which at that time were far more regular and certain,\r\nthe river used to overflow its high banks and flood the surrounding valleys\r\nto such an extent, that no punt could carry the wagons across.\r\nThereby the transport service used to be hung up, and numbers of wagons\r\nwould congregate for weeks on both sides of the river\r\nuntil the floods subsided.  At such times the price of fresh milk\r\nused to mount up to 1s. per pint.  There being next to no competition,\r\nwe boys had a monopoly over the milk trade.  We recalled\r\nthe number of haversacks full of bottles of milk we youngsters often carried\r\nto those wagons, how we returned with empty bottles and with just\r\nthat number of shillings.  Mother and our elder brothers\r\nhad leather bags full of gold and did not care for the \"boy's money\";\r\nand unlike the boys of the neighbouring village, having no sisters of our own,\r\nwe gave away some of our money to fair cousins, and jingled the rest\r\nin our pockets.  We had been told from boyhood that sweets were injurious\r\nto the teeth, and so spurning these delights we had hardly any use for money,\r\nfor all we wanted to eat, drink and wear was at hand in plenty.\r\nWe could then get six or eight shillings every morning\r\nfrom the pastime of washing that number of bottles,\r\nfilling them with fresh milk and carrying them down to the wagons;\r\nthere was always such an abundance of the liquid that\r\nour shepherd's hunting dog could not possibly miss what we took,\r\nfor while the flocks were feeding on the luscious buds of the haak-doorns\r\nand the orange-coloured blossoms of the rich mimosa and other wild vegetation\r\nthat abounded on the banks of the Vaal River, the cows, similarly engaged,\r\nwere gathering more and more milk.\r\n\r\nThe gods are cruel, and one of their cruellest acts of omission\r\nwas that of giving us no hint that in very much less\r\nthan a quarter of a century all those hundreds of heads of cattle,\r\nand sheep and horses belonging to the family would vanish\r\nlike a morning mist, and that we ourselves would live\r\nto pay 30s. per month for a daily supply of this same precious fluid,\r\nand in very limited quantities.  They might have warned us\r\nthat Englishmen would agree with Dutchmen to make it unlawful\r\nfor black men to keep milch cows of their own on the banks of that river,\r\nand gradually have prepared us for the shock.\r\n\r\nCrossing the river from the Transvaal side brings one\r\ninto the Province of the Orange \"Free\" State, in which,\r\nin the adjoining division of Boshof, we were born thirty-six years back.\r\nWe remember the name of the farm, but not having been\r\nin this neighbourhood since infancy, we could not tell its whereabouts,\r\nnor could we say whether the present owner was a Dutchman,\r\nhis lawyer, or a Hebrew merchant; one thing we do know, however:\r\nit is that even if we had the money and the owner was willing to sell the spot\r\nupon which we first saw the light of day and breathed the pure air of heaven,\r\nthe sale would be followed with a fine of one hundred pounds.\r\nThe law of the country forbids the sale of land to a Native.\r\nRussia is one of the most abused countries in the world,\r\nbut it is extremely doubtful if the statute book of that Empire contains a law\r\ndebarring the peasant from purchasing the land whereon he was born,\r\nor from building a home wherein he might end his days.\r\n\r\nAt this time we felt something rising from our heels along our back,\r\ngripping us in a spasm, as we were cycling along; a needlelike pang, too,\r\npierced our heart with a sharp thrill.  What was it?  We remembered\r\nfeeling something nearly like it when our father died eighteen years ago;\r\nbut at that time our physical organs were fresh and grief was easily\r\nthrown off in tears, but then we lived in a happy South Africa\r\nthat was full of pleasant anticipations, and now -- what changes for the worse\r\nhave we undergone!  For to crown all our calamities, South Africa has by law\r\nceased to be the home of any of her native children whose skins are dyed\r\nwith a pigment that does not conform with the regulation hue.\r\n\r\nWe are told to forgive our enemies and not to let the sun go down\r\nupon our wrath, so we breathe the prayer that peace may be to the white races,\r\nand that they, including our present persecutors of the Union Parliament,\r\nmay never live to find themselves deprived of all occupation and\r\nproperty rights in their native country as is now the case with the Native.\r\nHistory does not tell us of any other continent where the Bantu lived\r\nbesides Africa, and if this systematic ill-treatment of the Natives\r\nby the colonists is to be the guiding principle of Europe's scramble\r\nfor Africa, slavery is our only alternative; for now it is only as serfs\r\nthat the Natives are legally entitled to live here.  Is it to be thought\r\nthat God is using the South African Parliament to hound us\r\nout of our ancestral homes in order to quicken our pace heavenward?\r\nBut go from where to heaven?  In the beginning, we are told,\r\nGod created heaven and earth, and peopled the earth,\r\nfor people do not shoot up to heaven from nowhere.  They must have had\r\nan earthly home.  Enoch, Melchizedek, Elijah, and other saints,\r\ncame to heaven from earth.  God did not say to the Israelites\r\nin their bondage:  \"Cheer up, boys; bear it all in good part\r\nfor I have bright mansions on high awaiting you all.\"  But he said:\r\n\"I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt,\r\nand have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters;\r\nfor I know their sorrows, and I am come down to bring them\r\nout of the hands of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land\r\nunto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.\"\r\nAnd He used Moses to carry out the promise He made to their ancestor Abraham\r\nin Canaan, that \"unto thy seed will I give this land.\"  It is to be hoped\r\nthat in the Boer churches, entrance to which is barred against coloured people\r\nduring divine service, they also read the Pentateuch.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if we ever thought so much on a single bicycle ride\r\nas we did on this journey; however, the sight of a policeman ahead of us\r\ndisturbed these meditations and gave place to thoughts of quite another kind,\r\nfor -- we had no pass.  Dutchmen, Englishmen, Jews, Germans,\r\nand other foreigners may roam the \"Free\" State without permission --\r\nbut not Natives.  To us it would mean a fine and imprisonment\r\nto be without a pass.  The \"pass\" law was first instituted\r\nto check the movement of livestock over sparsely populated areas.\r\nIn a sense it was a wise provision, in that it served to identify\r\nthe livestock which one happened to be driving along the high road,\r\nto prove the bona fides of the driver and his title to the stock.\r\nAlthough white men still steal large droves of horses in Basutoland\r\nand sell them in Natal or in East Griqualand, they, of course,\r\nare not required to carry any passes.  These white horse-thieves,\r\nto escape the clutches of the police, employ Natives\r\nto go and sell the stolen stock and write the passes for these Natives,\r\nforging the names of Magistrates and Justices of the Peace.\r\nSuch native thieves in some instances ceasing to be hirelings\r\nin the criminal business, trade on their own, but it is not clear\r\nwhat purpose it is intended to serve by subjecting native pedestrians\r\nto the degrading requirement of carrying passes when they are not\r\nin charge of any stock.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the policeman was before us and we alighted\r\nin presence of the representative of the law, with our feet\r\non the accursed soil of the district in which we were born.\r\nThe policeman stopped.  By his looks and his familiar \"Dag jong\"\r\nwe noticed that the policeman was Dutch, and the embodiment of affability.\r\nHe spoke and we were glad to notice that he had no intention\r\nof dragging an innocent man to prison.  We were many miles\r\nfrom the nearest police station, and in such a case\r\none is generally able to gather the real views of the man on patrol,\r\nas distinct from the written code of his office, but our friend\r\nwas becoming very companionable.  Naturally we asked him about\r\nthe operation of the plague law.  He was a Transvaaler, he said,\r\nand he knew that Kafirs were inferior beings, but they had rights,\r\nand were always left in undisturbed possession of their property\r\nwhen Paul Kruger was alive.  \"The poor devils must be sorry now,\" he said,\r\n\"that they ever sang `God save the Queen' when the British troops\r\ncame into the Transvaal, for I have seen, in the course of my duties,\r\nthat a Kafir's life nowadays was not worth a ----, and I believe that no man\r\nregretted the change of flags now more than the Kafirs of Transvaal.\"\r\nThis information was superfluous, for personal contact\r\nwith the Natives of Transvaal had convinced us of the fact.\r\nThey say it is only the criminal who has any reason to rejoice over\r\nthe presence of the Union Jack, because in his case the cat-o'-nine-tails,\r\nexcept for very serious crimes, has been abolished.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the poor creatures,\" continued the policeman,\r\n\"I knew to be fairly comfortable, if not rich, and they enjoyed\r\nthe possession of their stock, living in many instances just like Dutchmen.\r\nMany of these are now being forced to leave their homes.\r\nCycling along this road you will meet several of them in search of new homes,\r\nand if ever there was a fool's errand, it is that of a Kafir\r\ntrying to find a new home for his stock and family just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you think, Baas Officer, must eventually be the lot of a people\r\nunder such unfortunate circumstances?\" we asked.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said the policeman, \"that it must serve them right.\r\nThey had no business to hanker after British rule, to cheat and plot\r\nwith the enemies of their Republic for the overthrow of their Government.\r\nWhy did they not assist the forces of their Republic during the war\r\ninstead of supplying the English with scouts and intelligence?\r\nOom Paul would not have died of a broken heart and he would still be there\r\nto protect them.  Serve them right, I say.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying he spurred his horse, which showed a clean pair of hoofs.\r\nHe left us rather abruptly, for we were about to ask\r\nwhy we, too, of Natal and the Cape were suffering, for we,\r\nbeing originally British subjects, never \"cheated and plotted with\r\nthe enemies of our Colonies\", but he was gone and left us still cogitating\r\nby the roadside.\r\n\r\nProceeding on our journey we next came upon a native trek\r\nand heard the same old story of prosperity on a Dutch farm:\r\nthey had raised an average 800 bags of grain each season,\r\nwhich, with the increase of stock and sale of wool, gave a steady income\r\nof about 150 Pounds per year after the farmer had taken his share.\r\nThere were gossipy rumours about somebody having met some one\r\nwho said that some one else had overheard a conversation\r\nbetween the Baas and somebody else, to the effect that the Kafirs\r\nwere getting too rich on his property.  This much involved tale\r\nincidentally conveys the idea that the Baas was himself getting too rich\r\non his farm.  For the Native provides his own seed, his own cattle,\r\nhis own labour for the ploughing, the weeding and the reaping,\r\nand after bagging his grain he calls in the landlord to receive his share,\r\nwhich is fifty per cent of the entire crop.\r\n\r\nAll had gone well till the previous week when the Baas came\r\nto the native tenants with the story that a new law had been passed\r\nunder which \"all my oxen and cows must belong to him, and my family to work\r\nfor 2 Pounds a month, failing which he gave me four days to leave the farm.\"\r\n\r\nWe passed several farm-houses along the road, where all\r\nappeared pretty tranquil as we went along, until the evening\r\nwhich we spent in the open country, somewhere near the boundaries\r\nof the Hoopstad and Boshof districts; here a regular circus had gathered.\r\nBy a \"circus\" we mean the meeting of groups of families,\r\nmoving to every point of the compass, and all bivouacked at this point\r\nin the open country where we were passing.  It was heartrending\r\nto listen to the tales of their cruel experiences derived from\r\nthe rigour of the Natives' Land Act.  Some of their cattle had perished\r\non the journey, from poverty and lack of fodder, and the native owners\r\nran a serious risk of imprisonment for travelling with dying stock.\r\nThe experience of one of these evicted tenants is typical of the rest,\r\nand illustrates the cases of several we met in other parts of the country.\r\n\r\nKgobadi, for instance, had received a message describing\r\nthe eviction of his father-in-law in the Transvaal Province, without notice,\r\nbecause he had refused to place his stock, his family, and his person\r\nat the disposal of his former landlord, who now refuses\r\nto let him remain on his farm except on these conditions.\r\nThe father-in-law asked that Kgobadi should try and secure a place for him\r\nin the much dreaded \"Free\" State as the Transvaal had suddenly\r\nbecome uninhabitable to Natives who cannot become servants;\r\nbut \"greedy folk hae lang airms\", and Kgobadi himself\r\nwas proceeding with his family and his belongings in a wagon,\r\nto inform his people-in-law of his own eviction, without notice,\r\nin the \"Free\" State, for a similar reason to that which sent\r\nhis father-in-law adrift.  The Baas had exacted from him\r\nthe services of himself, his wife and his oxen, for wages of 30s. a month,\r\nwhereas Kgobadi had been making over 100 Pounds a year, besides retaining\r\nthe services of his wife and of his cattle for himself.\r\nWhen he refused the extortionate terms the Baas retaliated with a Dutch note,\r\ndated the 30th day of June, 1913, which ordered him to \"betake himself\r\nfrom the farm of the undersigned, by sunset of the same day,\r\nfailing which his stock would be seized and impounded,\r\nand himself handed over to the authorities for trespassing on the farm.\"\r\n\r\nA drowning man catches at every straw, and so we were again and again\r\nappealed to for advice by these sorely afflicted people.\r\nTo those who were not yet evicted we counselled patience and submission\r\nto the absurd terms, pending an appeal to a higher authority\r\nthan the South African Parliament and finally to His Majesty the King who,\r\nwe believed, would certainly disapprove of all that we saw on that day\r\nhad it been brought to his notice.  As for those who were already evicted,\r\nas a Bechuana we could not help thanking God that Bechuanaland\r\n(on the western boundary of this quasi-British Republic) was still\r\nentirely British.  In the early days it was the base of David Livingstone's\r\nactivities and peaceful mission against the Portuguese and Arab slave trade.\r\nWe suggested that they might negotiate the numerous restrictions\r\nagainst the transfer of cattle from the Western Transvaal and seek an asylum\r\nin Bechuanaland.  We wondered what consolation we could give\r\nto these roving wanderers if the whole of Bechuanaland were under\r\nthe jurisdiction of the relentless Union Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt was cold that afternoon as we cycled into the \"Free\" State from Transvaal,\r\nand towards evening the southern winds rose.  A cutting blizzard\r\nraged during the night, and native mothers evicted from their homes\r\nshivered with their babies by their sides.  When we saw on that night\r\nthe teeth of the little children clattering through the cold,\r\nwe thought of our own little ones in their Kimberley home of an evening\r\nafter gambolling in their winter frocks with their schoolmates,\r\nand we wondered what these little mites had done that a home should suddenly\r\nbecome to them a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nKgobadi's goats had been to kid when he trekked from his farm;\r\nbut the kids, which in halcyon times represented the interest on his capital,\r\nwere now one by one dying as fast as they were born and left by the roadside\r\nfor the jackals and vultures to feast upon.\r\n\r\nThis visitation was not confined to Kgobadi's stock,\r\nMrs. Kgobadi carried a sick baby when the eviction took place,\r\nand she had to transfer her darling from the cottage to the jolting ox-wagon\r\nin which they left the farm.  Two days out the little one began to sink\r\nas the result of privation and exposure on the road, and the night\r\nbefore we met them its little soul was released from its earthly bonds.\r\nThe death of the child added a fresh perplexity to the stricken parents.\r\nThey had no right or title to the farm lands through which they trekked:\r\nthey must keep to the public roads -- the only places in the country\r\nopen to the outcasts if they are possessed of a travelling permit.\r\nThe deceased child had to be buried, but where, when, and how?\r\n\r\nThis young wandering family decided to dig a grave under cover of the darkness\r\nof that night, when no one was looking, and in that crude manner\r\nthe dead child was interred -- and interred amid fear and trembling,\r\nas well as the throbs of a torturing anguish, in a stolen grave,\r\nlest the proprietor of the spot, or any of his servants, should surprise them\r\nin the act.  Even criminals dropping straight from the gallows\r\nhave an undisputed claim to six feet of ground on which to rest\r\ntheir criminal remains, but under the cruel operation of the Natives' Land Act\r\nlittle children, whose only crime is that God did not make them white,\r\nare sometimes denied that right in their ancestral home.\r\n\r\nNumerous details narrated by these victims of an Act of Parliament\r\nkept us awake all that night, and by next morning we were glad enough\r\nto hear no more of the sickening procedure of extermination\r\nvoluntarily instituted by the South African Parliament.\r\nWe had spent a hideous night under a bitterly cold sky,\r\nconditions to which hundreds of our unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen\r\nin various parts of the country are condemned by the provisions\r\nof this Parliamentary land plague.  At five o'clock in the morning\r\nthe cold seemed to redouble its energies; and never before\r\ndid we so fully appreciate the Master's saying:  \"But pray ye that your flight\r\nbe not in the winter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V       Another Night with the Sufferers\r\n\r\n  Heureux ceux qui sont morts dans le calme des soirs,\r\n  Avant ces jours affreux de carnage et de haine!\r\n  Ils se sont endormis, le coeur rempli d'espoirs,\r\n  Dans un reve d'amour et de concorde humaine!\r\n\r\n  Ils n'ont pas entendu la sinistre remeur\r\n  Qui monte des hameaux consumes par la flamme,\r\n  Ni les cris des enfants et des vierges en pleurs,\r\n  Ni le gemissement des vieillards et des femmes!\r\n            Heureux les morts!\r\n                                       Maurice Kufferath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe parted sadly from these unfortunate nomads of an ungrateful\r\nand inhospitable country, after advising them to trek from the Union\r\ninto the arid deserts of Bechuanaland.  In our advice we laid special stress\r\nupon the costliness of such an expedition as theirs and upon\r\nthe many and varying regulations to be complied with, on such a trek,\r\nthrough the Western Transvaal.  But, cost whatever it may,\r\nthey, like ourselves, understood that as the law stood\r\nthey would be better off and safer beyond the boundaries of the Union.\r\n\r\nFrom here we worked our way into the Hoopstad district.  There we saw\r\nsome Natives who were, as it were, on pins and needles, their landlords\r\nhaving given them a few days in which to consider the advisability\r\nof either accepting the new conditions or leaving their houses.\r\nOur advice to these tenants was to accept, for the time being,\r\nany terms offered by their landlords, pending an appeal to His Majesty\r\nthe King; we also passed through a few farms where the white farmers were\r\nvisibly sympathetic towards the harried Natives.  Some of the white farmers\r\nwere accepting Natives as tenants on their farms in defiance of the law.\r\nWe naturally thanked these for their humanity and went our way,\r\npromising never to disclose their magnanimity to the Government officials.\r\n\"What has suddenly happened?\" one of these landlords asked.\r\n\"We were living so nicely with your people, and why should the law\r\nunsettle them in this manner?\"\r\n\r\nWe may here mention that a fortnight later we were in General Botha's\r\nconstituency in the Transvaal.  A few days before we arrived there\r\na meeting of white farmers was held at one of the Dutch farm-houses\r\nat which it was resolved to take the fullest advantage of the new law,\r\nwhich had placed the entire native population in the hands of the farmers.\r\nIt was further resolved that a Kafir who refused to become a servant\r\nshould at once be consigned to the road.\r\n\r\nA similar resolution was passed at another meeting of landlords\r\nat another place.  Part of the proceedings of this meeting\r\nwas reported in some, though not all, of the Dutch newspapers.\r\nWithout breaking our promise not to disclose any names of landlords\r\nwho felt it a duty to resist injustice, even though it bears the garb of law,\r\nwe will mention Mr. X., a Boer farmer, of the farm ----, near Thingamejig,\r\nbetween the town of ---- and the river ----.  He protested at the meeting,\r\nstating that the Transvaalers were not compelled to turn the Natives out,\r\nand that they were only debarred from taking any new native tenants;\r\nthat it was wicked to expel a Kafir from the farm for no reason whatever,\r\nand so make him homeless, since he could not, if evicted, go either\r\nto another farm or back to his old place.  For expressing his views so frankly\r\nMr. X. was threatened by his compatriots with physical violence!\r\nHis opponents also said that, if he continued to harbour Kafirs on his farm\r\nas tenants, they would hold him responsible for any stock\r\nthat they might lose.  The incidents of the meeting were related\r\nto the Natives by Mr. X. himself.  He told the Natives, further,\r\nthat he would go to the expense of fencing his farm with the Natives inside,\r\nso that they may be out of the reach of his infuriated neighbours.\r\n\r\nWe spent the next night in some native huts on a farm\r\nin the district of Hoopstad.  On that occasion we met a man\r\nwho had had a month's notice to leave his farm, and was going\r\nfrom farm to farm in search of a new place.  He had heard\r\nalarming stories about evictions wherever he went.  During that evening\r\nwe were treated to some more pitiful stories concerning\r\nthe atrocities of the wretched land Act.  Many native wanderers\r\nhad actually passed that farm during the preceding few days,\r\ntrudging aimlessly from place to place in search of some farmer\r\nwho might give them a shelter.  At first they thought\r\nthe stories about a new law were inventions or exaggerations,\r\nbut their own desperate straits and the prevailing native dislocation\r\nsoon taught them otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe similarity in the experiences of the sufferers would make\r\nmonotonous reading if given individually, but there are instances\r\nhere and there which give variety to the painful record,\r\nand these should yield the utmost satisfaction to the promoters of the Act,\r\nin proving to them the fell measure of their achievement.\r\nOne example of these experiences was that of a white farmer\r\nwho had induced a thrifty Native in another district to come and farm\r\non his estate.  The contract was duly executed about the end of May, 1913.\r\nIt was agreed that the Native should move over to the new place\r\nafter gathering his crops and sharing them with his old landlord,\r\nwhich he did in the third week in June.  On his arrival, however,\r\nthe new landlord's attitude towards him aroused his suspicions;\r\nhis suspicions were confirmed when, after some hesitation,\r\nthe landlord told him that their contract was illegal.  Having already\r\nleft his old place the legal embargo was also against his return there,\r\nand so his only course was to leave that place and wander about\r\nwith his stock and family.  They went in the direction of Kroonstad,\r\nand they have not been heard of since.\r\n\r\nThe next example is that of the oldest man in the \"Free\" State.\r\nHe had been evicted (so we were told during that evening on the farm)\r\nalong with his aged wife, his grey-headed children,\r\nthe children's children and grandchildren.  We may here add that we read\r\na confirmation of this case in the English weekly newspaper of Harrismith.\r\nThe paper's reference to this case will also illustrate the easy manner\r\nin which these outrageous evictions are reported in white newspapers.\r\nThere is no reference to the sinister undercurrent and hardships\r\nattending these evictions.  The paper in question, the `Harrismith Chronicle',\r\nsimply says: --\r\n\r\n==\r\n                               AN ANCIENT COUPLE\r\n\r\nA venerable Native whose age is no less than 119 years,\r\naccompanied by his wife, aged 98, and a son who is approaching 80,\r\nleft Harrismith on Tuesday by train for Volksrust.  The old man\r\nacquired some property in the Transvaal, and is leaving this district\r\nto start a new home with as much interest in the venture\r\nas if he were a stripling of twenty.  The old lady had to be carried\r\nto the train, but the old man walked fairly firmly.  The aged couple\r\nwere the centre of much kindly attraction, and were made\r\nas comfortable as possible for their journey by the railway officials.\r\nIt is difficult to realize in these days of rapid change\r\nthat in the departure from the \"Free\" State of this venerable party\r\nwe are losing from our midst a man who was born in 1794,\r\nand has lived in no less than three centuries of time.\r\nGood luck to them both; may they still live long and prosper!\r\n==\r\n\r\nNow, as a matter of fact, this \"ancient couple\" had not left the \"Free\" State\r\nof their own free will.  Their stock had been expelled from\r\ntheir grazing areas, and they were told that they could only continue to graze\r\nif the centenarian tenant agreed to supply a certain number of labourers\r\nto work on the landowner's farm and with his sons ceased to do any ploughing\r\nas tenants.  This system of sharing the crops has been followed\r\never since the Boers planted themselves in the \"Free\" State, and the family\r\nhad had no other means of support.  Happily the aid of Providence\r\nin the case of this \"ancient couple\" was speedy, as the old people\r\nquickly found an asylum on the farm of Mr. P. ka I. Seme, a native solicitor\r\nin the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nAt the same place on the same evening we were told of a conversation\r\nbetween a well-known Dutchman and a Native.  \"The object of this law,\"\r\nsaid the Burgher, \"is to goad the Natives into rebellion,\r\nso that the Government may legally confiscate what little ground\r\nwas left to them, and hand over the dispossessed Kafirs and their families\r\nto work for the farmers, just for their food.\"  The policy of\r\ngoading the Natives into rebellion is not wholly foreign to Colonial policy;\r\nbut the horrible cruelty to which live stock is exposed under the new Act\r\nis altogether a new departure.  King Solomon says, \"The righteous man\r\nregardeth the life of his beast, but the tender mercies of the wicked\r\nare cruel\"; but there is a Government of professed Bible readers who,\r\nin defiance of all Scriptural precepts, pass a law which penalizes\r\na section of the community along with their oxen, sheep, goats,\r\nhorses and donkeys on account of the colour of their owners.\r\nThe penalty clause (Section 5) imposes a fine of 100 Pounds on a landowner\r\nwho accommodates a Native on his farm; and if after the fine is paid\r\nthe Native leaves his stock on the farm to go and look for a fresh place,\r\nthere will be an additional fine of 5 Pounds for every day\r\nthat the Native's cattle remain on that farm.  They must\r\ntake the road immediately and be kept moving day and night\r\nuntil they die of starvation, or until the owner (who is debarred,\r\nby Section 1, from purchasing a pasturage for his cattle) disposes of them\r\nto a white man.\r\n\r\nSuch cruelty to dumb animals is as unwarranted as it is unprecedented.\r\nIt reads cruel enough on paper, but we wish that the reader had accompanied us\r\non one journey, say, during the cold snap in the first week in August,\r\nwhen we travelled from Potchefstroom to Vereeniging,\r\nand seen the flocks of those evicted Natives that we met.\r\nWe frequently met those roving pariahs, with their hungry cattle,\r\nand wondered if the animals were not more deserving of pity than their owners.\r\nIt may be the cattle's misfortune that they have a black owner,\r\nbut it is certainly not their fault, for sheep have no choice\r\nin the selection of a colour for their owners, and no cows or goats\r\nare ever asked to decide if the black boy who milks them shall be their owner,\r\nor but a herd in the employ of a white man; so why should they be starved\r\non account of the colour of their owners?  We knew of a law to prevent cruelty\r\nto animals, but had never thought that we should live to meet in one day\r\nso many dumb creatures making silent appeals to Heaven for protection\r\nagainst the law.  \"What man has nerve to do, man has not nerve to see\",\r\nand oh! if those gifted Parliamentarians could have been mustered here\r\nto witness the wretched results of one of their fine days' work\r\nfor a fine day's pay!  But \"they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne\",\r\nthen draw their Parliamentary emoluments and retire to the quiet\r\nof their comfortable homes, to enjoy more rest than is due to toilers\r\nwho have served both God and humanity.\r\n\r\nDuring this same night in Hoopstad district we were also told of the visit\r\nof a Dutch farmer in the middle of June, 1913, to his native tenants.\r\nOne of the Natives -- named Kgabale -- was rather old.  His two sons are\r\ndelving in the gold mines of Johannesburg, and return home each spring time\r\nto help the old man and their two young sisters to do the ploughing.\r\nThe daughters tend the fields and Kgabale looks after the stock.\r\nBy this means they have been enabled to lead a respectable life\r\nand to pay the landowner fifty per cent. of the produce every year,\r\nbesides the taxes levied by the Government on Natives.\r\nThree weeks before our visit, the farmer came to cancel\r\nKgabale's verbal contract with him and to turn the family\r\ninto unpaid servants, in return for the privilege of squatting on his farm.\r\nAs Kgabale himself was too old to work, the farmer demanded of him\r\nthat his two sons should return immediately from Johannesburg\r\nto render manual service on his farm, failing which, the old man\r\nshould forthwith betake himself from the place.  He gave Kgabale seven days\r\nto deliver his two sons.\r\n\r\nNaturally this decision came upon Kgabale and his daughters\r\nlike a bolt from the blue.  The poor old man wandered from place to place,\r\ntrying to find some one -- and it took him two days to do so --\r\nwho could write, so as to dictate a letter to his sons in Johannesburg,\r\ninforming them of what had happened.  The week expired before he could get\r\na reply from Johannesburg.  The landlord, in a very abusive mood,\r\nagain demanded the instant arrival of his two sons from Johannesburg,\r\nto commence work at the farm-house the very next morning.\r\nKgabale spent the whole night praying that at least one of his sons\r\nmight come.  By daybreak next morning no answer had arrived,\r\nand the Dutchman came and set fire to the old man's houses,\r\nand ordered him then and there to quit the farm.  It was a sad sight\r\nto see the feeble old man, his aged wife and his daughters\r\ndriven in this way from a place which they had regarded as their home.\r\nIn the ordinary course, such a calamity could have been made more tolerable\r\nby moving to the next farm and there await the arrival and advice of his sons;\r\nbut now, under the Natives' Land Act, no sympathetic landowner\r\nwould be permitted to shelter them for a single day.  So Kgabale was said\r\nto have gone in the direction of Klerksdorp.\r\n\r\nOne of the sons arrived a week after the catastrophe.  He found\r\nhis old home in ruins, and that his aged parents and their children\r\nhad become victims of the turpitude of an Act of Parliament.\r\nThe son went in search of his relatives across the Vaal,\r\nbut it was not known if they succeeded in finding the refuge\r\nwhich the law had made unlawful.\r\n\r\nAmong the squatters on the same farm as Kgabale was a widow named Maria.\r\nHer husband in his lifetime had lived as a tenant on the farm,\r\nploughing in shares until his death.  After his death\r\nMaria kept on the contract and made a fair living.  Her son and daughter,\r\naged fourteen and sixteen respectively, took turns at herding her cattle\r\nand assisting the mother in other ways.  During the ploughing season,\r\nthey hired assistance to till the fields, but they themselves\r\ntended and reaped the harvest and delivered 50 per cent of the produce\r\nto the landowner.  Such were the conditions on which she was allowed\r\nto live on the farm.  Maria, being a widow, and her son being but a youth,\r\nit was hoped that the landlord would propose reasonable terms for her;\r\nbut instead, his proposal was that she should dispose of her stock\r\nand indenture her children to him.  This sinister proposal makes it evident\r\nthat farmers not only expect Natives to render them free labour,\r\nbut they actually wish the Natives to breed slaves for them.\r\nMaria found it difficult to comply with her landlord's demand,\r\nand as she had no husband, from whom labour could be exacted,\r\nthe Dutchman ordered her to \"clear out, and,\" he added with an oath,\r\n\"you must get another man before you reach your next place of abode,\r\nas the law will not permit you to stay there till you have a man\r\nto work for the Baas.\"  Having given this counsel the landlord is said\r\nto have set fire to Maria's thatched cottage, and as the chilly south-easter\r\nblew the smoke of her burning home towards the north-west, Maria,\r\nwith her bedclothes on her head, and on the heads of her son and daughter,\r\nand carrying her three-year-old boy tied to her back,\r\nwalked off from the farm, driving her cows before her.\r\nIn parting from the endeared associations of their late home,\r\nfor one blank and unknown, the children were weeping bitterly.\r\nNor has any news of the fate of this family been received\r\nsince they were forced out on this perilous adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI      Our Indebtedness to White Women\r\n\r\n  O woman! in our hours of ease\r\n  Uncertain, coy, and hard to please,\r\n   And variable as the shade\r\n  By the light quivering aspen made;\r\n  When pain and anguish wring the brow,\r\n   A ministering angel thou.\r\n                                       Scott.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome farmers (unfortunately too few) who had at first intended\r\nto change the status of their native tenants, had been obliged\r\nto abandon the idea owing to the determined opposition of their wives.\r\nOne such case was particularly interesting.  Thus, at Dashfontein,\r\nthe wife of a Dutch farmer, a Mr. V., on whose property some native families\r\nwere squatting, got up, one morning, and found the kitchen-maid\r\nvery disagreeable.  The morning coffee had been made right enough,\r\nbut the maid's \"Morre, Nooi\" (Good morning, ma'am) was rather sullen\r\nand almost bordering on insolence.  She did her scullery work as usual,\r\nbut did not seem to care, that morning, about wasting time inquiring\r\nhow baby slept, and if Nonnie had got rid of her neuralgia, and so on.\r\nShe spoke only when spoken to and answered mainly in monosyllables.\r\nMrs. V. was perplexed.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, Anna?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, Nooi,\" replied Anna curtly.\r\n\r\nMrs. V. tried some of her witty jokes, but they seemed to be wasted on Anna.\r\nAfter jesting with the servant had failed, scolding was next tried,\r\nbut nothing seemed to bring back the girl's usual cheerfulness.\r\n\"Oh, Anna,\" said the mistress at length, \"you make me think of the olden days,\r\nwhen such disagreeable whims on the part of frowning maids\r\nused to be cured by ----\"\r\n\r\nAnna was evidently not listening, and, if she had heard the mistress,\r\nshe did not care two straws (or one straw for that matter) what cures\r\nMrs. V.'s great-grandmother had prescribed for sullen servant girls.\r\nIn fact, Anna had become a wild Kafir, for though she went about her work\r\nin silence, her face bore an expression which seemed to speak louder\r\nthan her mouth could have done.  She was clearly engaged\r\nin serious thought.  The mistress tried to dismiss from her mind\r\nthe inexplicable attitude of her servant, but the frowning look on Anna's face\r\nmade the attempts unsuccessful.  The fact that when Anna went home,\r\nthe previous night, she was happiness personified, did not decrease\r\nMrs. V.'s perplexity.\r\n\r\n\"There must be something wrong,\" Mrs. V. concluded, after vainly trying\r\nruse after ruse to get a smile out of her servant girl.  \"Something is amiss.\r\nI wonder if one of those well-dressed Kafirs from Potchefstroom\r\nhad been prowling about the farm and instilling in Anna's simple mind\r\nall kinds of silly notions, about town flirts and black dandies,\r\nsilk dresses in Potchefstroom and similar vuilgoed (rubbish).\r\nAnd if a town Kafir is going to marry Anna, where on earth am I going to get\r\na reliable servant to whom I could securely entrust my home when I have\r\noccasion to go to town or to the seaside on a shorter or longer vacation?\r\nWho could cook and attend to my husband's and children's peculiar wants,\r\nif Anna is going to leave us?  It seems certain that Anna's heart\r\nis not on the farm,\" she said to herself.  \"It was there right enough\r\nwhen she went home last night, but it is clear that some one has stolen it\r\nduring the night.  Anna is helplessly lovesick.  I must find out who it is.\r\nThe swain must be found and induced to come and join, or supervise,\r\nour squatters.  We cannot let him take her away, for what will the homestead\r\nbe without Anna?  I was looking forward to her marrying on the farm\r\nand giving her a superior cottage so that other Kafir girls may see\r\nhow profitable it is to be good.  Anna leaving the farm, O, nee wat! (Oh, no).\r\nWe must find out who it is; but wait, there is old Gert (her father) coming,\r\nwith old Jan (her uncle).  I must find out from them who had been intruding\r\ninto the company of their daughters last night.  I should warn them\r\nto be on the alert lest Anna elopes to Potchefstroom with somebody,\r\nprobably to take the train and go farther -- to Johannesburg or Kimberley,\r\nas did Klein Mietje, whom I had hoped to train as our housemaid ----\"\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Auta Gert, how is Mietje and the kleintjes (little ones)?\"\r\n\r\nAuta Gert's demeanour was a greater puzzle to Mrs. V. than his daughter's\r\nwhen he replied, \"So, so.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. V. (between horns of the same dilemma):  \"And you, Auta Jan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ja, Missus,\" replied Jan.\r\n\r\nMrs. V.'s perplexity was intense, for it became evident that the two Natives\r\nwere there as a deputation, charged with some grave mission.\r\nBefore she uttered another word the two Natives asked for an interview.\r\n\r\n\"Not to waste much time, Missus,\" began old Gert, \"a thunderbolt has burst\r\non the native settlement on the farm, and Dashfontein is no longer\r\na home to us ----\"\r\n\r\n\"No longer a home!\" exclaimed Mrs. V.  \"I hope you idiotic Kafirs\r\nare not going to be so foolhardy as to leave me, leave the Baas,\r\nand leave the farm upon which your fathers and mothers lie buried.\r\nDo not you know that during this very week numbers of Natives have been\r\ncalling on the Baas, asking him for places of abode, complaining that\r\nthey have been turned adrift, with their little ones and their hungry animals,\r\nfor refusing to become servants to farmers on whose property\r\nthey had been ploughing on shares?  White men have suddenly\r\nbecome brutes and have expelled Natives with whom they have lived\r\nfrom childhood -- Natives whose labour made the white man wealthy\r\nare turned away by people who should treat them with gratitude.\r\nAnd are you going to leave your old home just when the Devil\r\nappears to have possessed himself of the hearts of most farmers?\r\nIn your own interest, apart from my own and the Baas's, Auta Gert,\r\nyou should have left us long ago when you could find a place elsewhere.\r\nAre you so deaf and blind as not to hear and see the change\r\nwhich has come over the country of late?  White men formerly punished a Kafir\r\nwho had done some wrong, now they worry him from sheer cussedness.\r\nYou must be mad, Auta Gert, to try and leave us.  What is going\r\nto become of your family and your beautiful cattle.  No wonder that Anna\r\nis so upset.  I have been thinking that some rondlooper (vagabond)\r\nfrom the towns had been trying to take her away.\"\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. V. spoke she was agreeably surprised to find the sobering effect\r\nwhich her rebuke seemed to have upon her husband's native tenants.\r\nShe knew her influence over them, especially over the old native families,\r\nbut in all her dealings and close association with them she could not remember\r\nan impromptu speech of hers that produced such immediate results.\r\nThe faces of the two Natives brightened up, and they kept\r\nlooking at one another as she spoke.  At length she turned round\r\ntowards the stoep and there was Anna, for the first time that morning,\r\ninterested in and delighted by what she said.  Usually it would have been\r\na serious breach of the rules of the house for Anna to listen\r\nwhen the Missus was speaking about something that did not immediately concern\r\nher scullery duties; but Mrs. V.'s satisfaction was unbounded\r\non seeing the bright look on her servant's face, which she had hitherto\r\nvainly sought.\r\n\r\n\"Now, you see,\" said Anna to her father, \"I told you it would never happen\r\nif the Missus can help it.\"\r\n\r\nAt this, the men could scarcely suppress a laugh.  The Missus\r\nlooked round again, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Anna, have you Kafirs plotted to fool me this morning?  Because I take\r\nsuch a deep interest in your welfare, you have so far forgotten yourselves\r\nthat you connived with your parents to come over to my house and fool me\r\non my own farm?  What is the meaning of all this?\"\r\n\r\nAuta Gert unfolded his story.  The Baas was at the native settlement\r\nthe previous day.  He called a meeting of the native peasants and told them\r\nof the new law, under which no Kafir can buy a farm or hire a farm.\r\nHe added that, according to this law, their former relations\r\nof landlord and tenants have been made a criminal offence,\r\nfor which they could be fined a hundred pounds, and he gave them ten days\r\nto decide whether they would become his servants or leave the farm.\r\n\r\n\"Go away, Auta Gert; you were dreaming, my husband would never talk\r\nsuch nonsense.  You have been with him from childhood,\r\nlong before I ever knew him, and yet you do not know that my husband\r\nis incapable of uttering anything half so wicked?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said it was the law, the new law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you need some stringent measures against the useless,\r\nsneaking and prowling loafers, but there is no fear that such laws\r\ncould apply to Natives like you and Mietje and your children.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Nooi, the Baas told us to leave the farm as the law\r\ndid not permit him to ----\"\r\n\r\n\"Get you gone, Auta Gert, he was joking.  You must know that the law\r\ndid not buy this farm.  The old Baas purchased it from Baas Philander.\r\nI personally helped to add up the number of morgen and to calculate the money,\r\nand there was not a penny piece from any Government.  Go home, Auta Gert,\r\nand leave everything to me, and do not let me hear you saying\r\nDashfontein is no longer your home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Nooi,\" assented the Natives with some relief, \"if you say\r\nit is all right, then it must be so, and we will go back and reap our mealies\r\nin peace, and if a policeman comes round demanding a hundred pounds\r\nwe will tell him to arrest us and take us to the Nooi of the farm.\r\nGood-bye, Nooi.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Auta Gert; good-bye, Auta Jan ----  Poor Anna, my dear little maid,\r\nwhy did you not tell Nooi this morning that you were worried over this matter.\r\nReally, Anna, I was thinking that you were lovesick.  How did poor old Mietje\r\ntake it?  Sadly, did she.  Well, I will speak to the Baas about it.\r\nHe had no business to attempt to bring bad luck over us\r\nby disturbing our peaceful Natives with such godless tidings.\r\nTell your mother that Nooi says it will be all right.\"\r\n\r\nA few days later, Hendrik Prins, the farm manager in the employ of Mr. V.,\r\nwas due at the native settlement to see the steam sheller at work\r\nand also to receive the landowner's share of the produce.  Instead of Prins,\r\nMr. V. attended in person.  Each Native regarded this unusual occurrence\r\nas the signal for their impending eviction and thought that day would see\r\ntheir last transaction with their old master and landlord.\r\n\r\nMr. V. counted the separate bags filled with mealies and Kafir corn\r\nplaced in groups around the sheller.  He counted no fewer than 12,300 bags,\r\nand knew that his share would total 6,150, representing about\r\n3,000 Pounds gross.  Could he ever succeed in getting so much,\r\nwith so little trouble, if poor whites tilled his lands\r\ninstead of these Natives? he thought.  After all, his dear Johanna was right.\r\nThis law is blind and must be resisted.  It gives more consideration\r\nto the so-called poor whites (a respectable term for lazy whites),\r\nthan to the owners of the ground.  He, there and then, resolved to resist it\r\nand take the consequences.\r\n\r\nThe grain was all threshed; a number of native girls were busy\r\nsewing up the bags, and the engine-driver ordered his men\r\nto yoke his oxen and pull the machine away.  Mr. V. ordered Auta Gert\r\nto call all the `volk' together as he had something to tell them.\r\nAuta Gert, knowing the determination of his mistress,\r\ndid so in confidence that they were about to receive some glad tidings.\r\nBut the other folks came forward with a grievous sense of wrong.\r\nThe fact that some Natives on the adjoining property\r\nhad been turned away three days before and sent homeless about the country,\r\ntheir places being taken by others, who, tired of roaming about and losing\r\nnearly everything, had come in as serfs did not allay their fears.\r\nAuta Hans was already conjuring up visions of a Johannesburg speculator\r\nliterally \"taking\" his Cape shorthorns for a mere bagatelle,\r\nas they did to William Ranco, another evicted squatter from Hoopstad.\r\n\r\nMr. V., the farmer, mounted a handy wagon hard by and commenced to address\r\nthe crowd of blacks who gathered around the wagon at the call of Gert.\r\n\r\n\"Attention!  Listen,\" he said.  \"You will remember that I was here last month\r\nand explained to you the new law.  Well, I understand that that explanation\r\ncreated the greatest amount of unrest amongst the Natives in the huts\r\non my farm.  Personally, I am very sorry that it ever came to that,\r\nbut let me tell you that your Nooi, my wife, says it is not right\r\nthat the terms under which we have lived in the past should be disturbed.\r\nI agree with her that it is unjust, and that the good Lord,\r\nwho has always blessed us, will turn His face from us\r\nif people are unsettled and sent away from the farm in a discontented mood.\"\r\n(Loud and continued applause, during which Mr. V. took out\r\nhis pouch of Magaliesburg tobacco and lit his pipe.)  \"The Nooi,\" he continued\r\nafter a few puffs, \"says we must not obey this law:  she even says,\r\nif it comes to physical ejectment, or if they take me to prison,\r\nshe is prepared to go to Pretoria in person and interview General Botha.\"\r\n(More cheers, during which the Natives dispersed to cart away their mealies\r\namidst general satisfaction.)\r\n\r\n     *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nThe writer visited Dashfontein in July, 1913, when the above narrative\r\nwas given him word for word by old Gert.\r\n\r\nAs old Gert narrated the story, Aunt Mietje, his wife,\r\nwho had had timely notice of the impending visit of the morulaganyi (editor)\r\nfrom her husband (who slaughtered a sheep in honour of the occasion),\r\nsuperintended with interesting expectations over frizzling items\r\nin the frying-pan on her fireplace.  Her bright eyes, beaming from\r\nunder her headkerchief, suggested how she must have been\r\nthe undisputed belle of her day.  The rough wooden table was covered\r\nwith the best linen in the native settlement, and on it were laid\r\nsome clean plates, and the old yet shining cutlery reserved for\r\nspecial occasions, besides other signs of an approaching evening meal.\r\nHaving learnt the art from an experienced housewife on whose farm\r\nher people were squatting, and improved upon her teaching,\r\nshe was famous in the neighbourhood for the excellence of her cooking.\r\nHer only worry in that department was her seeming lack of success\r\nin training her daughters up to her elevation.  She is usually sent for\r\nwhen important visitors come to Dashfontein, and would then don\r\nher best costume of coloured German print, and carry down with her\r\nthe spotless apron which Mrs. V. gave her the preceding New Year;\r\nand in spite of her advancing years, she would cause Anna,\r\nand every other upstart at the homestead, instinctively to play\r\nsecond fiddle to her.  And when we suggested that our wife\r\ncould measure swords (or, shall we say, forks) with her as a cook,\r\nshe giggled and remembered some white man's proverb about\r\nthe proof of the pudding being in the eating.\r\n\r\nAfter the harrowing experience of the previous week, during which\r\nwe were forced to see our fellow-beings hounded out of their homes,\r\nand the homes broken up; their lifelong earnings frittered away\r\nby a law of the land, their only crime being the atrocious one of having\r\nthe same colour of skin as our own, and finding ourselves suddenly landed\r\non an oasis, the farm of a kind Dutchman and his noble wife,\r\non whose property, and by whose leave, little black piccaninnies\r\nstill played about in spite of the law, it can be readily understood\r\nwith what comfort we sat down and did justice to the good things\r\nprovided by Aunt Mietje.  In the course of her preparation\r\nevery step of hers suggested that she entertained no sort of misprised opinion\r\nabout her superiority over her compeers; and nothing pleased her better\r\nthan when she dazzled her husband and family connexions\r\nwith deeds which proved her superiority over her contemporaries,\r\nin everything that tends to make the virtuous and industrious house-wife.\r\nShe gave a dramatic ending to her husband's narrative when she said --\r\n\r\n\"Who would have thought that Hannetje, naughty little Hannetje,\r\nwho was so troublesome when my sister used to nurse her --\r\nwho would have thought that she would ever prove to be\r\nthe salvation of our people?  Who ever anticipated that all the strong Boers,\r\non whom we had relied, would desert us when the fate of our whole tribe\r\nhung in the balance?  Natives have been moving from north to south,\r\nand from south to north, all searching at the same time\r\nfor homes and grazing for their cattle.  During the last few weeks\r\nthe roads were hidden in clouds of dust, sent up by\r\nhundreds of hoofs of hundreds of cattle, their owners with them,\r\nvainly seeking places of refuge; but in the case of Dashfontein,\r\nwe reclined on a veritable Mount Ararat, by grace of naughty little Hannetje,\r\nwhom God in His mysterious foresight had raised up to be Mrs. van V.,\r\nproprietress of Dashfontein.  If my prayers are of any value,\r\nGod will appoint in heaven a special place for her when she gets there,\r\nthough, for the sake of our people, I hope that time is very far distant.\r\nHowever, I hope to be somewhere near:  in truth, I should like\r\nto accompany her, when Elijah's chariot comes for her soul,\r\nso as to render her what little aid I can on board, when she soars\r\nthrough unknown tracts of space to the spirit world on high,\r\nso that if there be any uncomfortable questions about her maiden vagaries,\r\nI may be there to attest that she has since atoned a hundred fold for each,\r\nand thus accelerate her promotion.  No no, Hannetje is not a Boer vrouw,\r\nshe is an angel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII     Persecution of Coloured Women in the Orange Free State\r\n\r\n  Ripe persecution, like the plant\r\n  Whose nascence Mocha boasted,\r\n  Some bitter fruit produced, whose worth\r\n  Was never known till roasted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Free State ex-Republicans made use of the South African Constitution\r\n-- a Constitution which Lord Gladstone says is one after the Boer sentiment --\r\nto ruin the coloured population, they should at least\r\nhave confined their persecution to the male portion of the blacks\r\n(as is done in a milder manner in the other three Provinces), and have left\r\nthe women and children alone.  According to this class legislation,\r\nno native woman in the Province of the Orange \"Free\" State can reside\r\nwithin a municipality (whether with or without her parents, or her husband)\r\nunless she can produce a permit showing that she is a servant\r\nin the employ of a white person, this permit being signed\r\nby the Town Clerk.  All repressive measures under the old Republic\r\n(which, in matters of this kind, always showed a regard\r\nfor the suzerainty of Great Britain) were mildly applied.\r\nNow, under the Union, the Republicans are told by the Imperial authorities\r\nthat since they are self-governing they have the utmost freedom of action,\r\nincluding freedom to do wrong, without any fear of Imperial interference.\r\nOf this licence the white inhabitants of the Union are making the fullest use.\r\nLike a mastiff long held in the leash they are urging the application\r\nof all the former stringent measures enacted against the blacks,\r\nand the authorities, in obedience to their electoral supporters,\r\nare enforcing these measures with the utmost rigour against the blacks\r\nbecause they have no votes.\r\n\r\nHence, whereas the pass regulations were formerly never enforced by the Boers\r\nagainst clergymen's wives or against the families of respectable\r\nnative inhabitants, now a minister's wife has not only to produce a pass\r\non demand, but, like every woman of colour, she has to pay a shilling\r\nfor a fresh pass at the end of the month, so that a family consisting of,\r\nsay, a mother and five daughters pay the municipality 6s. every month,\r\nwhether as a penalty for the colour of their skins or a penalty for their sex\r\nit is not clear which.\r\n\r\nThere is some unexplained anomaly in this woman's pass business.\r\nIf the writer were to go and live in the \"Free\" State, he could\r\napply for and obtain letters of exemption from the ordinary pass laws;\r\nbut if his wife, who has had a better schooling and enjoyed\r\nan older civilization than he, were to go and reside in the \"Free\" State\r\nwith her daughters, all of them would be forced to carry passes\r\non their persons, and be called upon to ransack their skirt pockets\r\nat any time in the public streets at the behest of male policemen\r\nin quest of their passes.  Several white men are at present undergoing\r\nlong terms of imprisonment inflicted by the Orange \"Free\" State Circuit Courts\r\nfor criminally outraging coloured women whom the pass laws had placed\r\nin the hollow of the hands of these ruffians.  Still many more mothers\r\nare smothering evidence of similar outrages upon innocent daughters --\r\ncases that could never have happened under ordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe Natives of the \"Free\" State have made all possible constitutional appeals\r\nagainst these outrages.  In reply to their petitions the Provincial Government\r\nblames the municipalities.  The latter blame the law and the Union Parliament,\r\nand there the matter ends.  We have read the \"Free\" State law\r\nwhich empowers the municipalities to frame regulations\r\nfor the control of Natives, etc., but it must be confessed\r\nthat our limited intelligence could discern nothing in it\r\nwhich could be construed as imposing any dire penalties\r\non municipalities which emancipate their coloured women\r\nfrom the burden of the insidious pass law and tax.  Hon. Mr. H. Burton,\r\nas already stated, was Minister for Native Affairs before the Union Government\r\nsurrendered to the \"Free\" State reactionaries.  A deputation\r\nconsisting of Mrs. A. S. Gabashane, Mrs. Kotsi and Mrs. Louw,\r\nwomen from Bloemfontein -- the first-named being a clergyman's wife --\r\nwaited on him in Capetown on the subject of these grievances,\r\nand he assured them that in response to representations made\r\nby the Native Congress, he had already written to Dr. Ramsbottom,\r\nthe Provincial Administrator, asking him to persuade\r\nthe \"Free\" State municipalities to relieve the native women from this burden.\r\nAnd if to relieve native women in the \"Free\" State from a burden\r\nwhich obtains nowhere else in the Union were unlawful,\r\nas the municipalities aver, Mr. Burton -- a K.C. -- would have been\r\nthe last person to ask them to break the law.\r\n\r\nSubsequently the women petitioned Lady Gladstone for her intercession.\r\nBut we wonder if the petition was ever handed to Lady Gladstone\r\nby the responsible authority who, in this instance, would have been\r\nthe Department of Native Affairs.  Notwithstanding all these efforts,\r\nnative women in the \"Free\" State are still forced to buy passes\r\nevery month or go to prison, and they are still exposed\r\nto the indecent provision of the law authorizing male constables\r\nto insult them by day and by night, without distinction.\r\n\r\nAfter exhausting all these constitutional means on behalf of their women,\r\nand witnessing the spread of the trouble to the women and children\r\nof the country districts under the Natives' Land Act, the male Natives\r\nof the municipalities of the Province of the Orange \"Free\" State\r\nsaw their women folk throwing off their shawls and taking the \"law\"\r\ninto their own hands.  A crowd of 600 women, in July, 1913,\r\nmarched to the Municipal Offices at Bloemfontein and asked\r\nto see the Mayor.  He was not in, so they called for the Town Clerk.\r\nThe Deputy-Mayor came out, and they deposited before him a bag\r\ncontaining their passes of the previous month and politely signified\r\ntheir intention not to buy any more passes.  Then there occurred\r\nwhat `John Bull' would call, \"----l with the lid off\".\r\n\r\nAt Jagersfontein there was a similar demonstration, led by\r\na jet-black Mozambique lady.  She and a number of others\r\nwere arrested and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment.\r\nThe sentences ranged from about three weeks to three months,\r\nand the fines from 10s. to 3 Pounds.  They all refused to pay the fines,\r\nand said their little ones could be entrusted to the care of Providence\r\ntill their mothers and sisters have broken the shackles of oppression\r\nby means of passive resistance.  As the prison authorities\r\nwere scarcely prepared for such a sudden influx of prisoners\r\nthere was not sufficient accommodation for fifty-two women,\r\nwho were conveyed on donkey carts to the adjoining village of Fauresmith.\r\n\r\nWhen this happened, Winburg, the old capital of the \"Free\" State,\r\nalso had a similar trouble.  Eight hundred women marched\r\nfrom the native location to the Town Hall, singing hymns,\r\nand addressed the authorities.  They were tired of making friendly appeals\r\nwhich bore no fruit from year's end to year's end, so they had resolved,\r\nthey said, to carry no more passes, much less to pay a shilling each\r\nper month, PER CAPITA, for passes.  A procession of so many women\r\nwould attract attention even in Piccadilly, but in a \"Free\" State dorp\r\nit was a stupendous event, and it made a striking impression.\r\nThe result was that many of the women were arrested and sent to prison,\r\nbut they all resolutely refused to pay their fines, and there was a rumour\r\nthat the Central Government had been appealed to for funds and for material\r\nto fit out a new jail to cope with the difficulty.\r\n\r\nThis movement served to exasperate the authorities, who rigorously\r\nenforced the law and sent them to jail.  The first batch of prisoners\r\nfrom Bloemfontein were conveyed south to Edenburg; and as further batches\r\ncame down from Bloemfontein they had to be retransferred north to Kroonstad.\r\nIn the course of our tour in connexion with the Natives' Land Act\r\nin August, 1913, we spent a week-end with the Rev. A. P. Pitso,\r\nof the last-named town.  Thirty-four of the women passive resisters were still\r\nincarcerated there, doing hard labour.  Mrs. Pitso and Mrs. Michael Petrus\r\nwent with us on the Sunday morning to visit the prisoners at the jail.\r\n\r\nA severe shock burst upon us, inside the prison walls,\r\nwhen the matron withdrew the barriers and the emaciated figures\r\nof ladies and young girls of our acquaintance filed out and greeted us.\r\nIt was an exceptionally cold week, and our hearts bled to see\r\nyoung women of Bloemfontein, who had spent all their lives\r\nin the capital and never knew what it was to walk without socks,\r\nwalking the chilly cemented floors and the cold and sharp pebbles\r\nwithout boots.  Their own boots and shoes had been taken off,\r\nthey told us, and they were, throughout the winter,\r\nforced to perform hard labour barefooted.\r\n\r\nWas ever inhumanity more cold-blooded?\r\n\r\nDo these \"Free\" Staters consider their brutality less brutal\r\nbecause it happens to be sanctioned by law?\r\n\r\nIs Heaven so entirely unmindful of our case that it looks on with indifference\r\nwhen indignity upon indignity is heaped, not only upon our innocent men,\r\nbut even upon our inoffensive women?\r\n\r\nTears rolled down our cheeks as we saw the cracks on their bare feet,\r\nthe swellings and chronic chilblains, which made them look like sheep\r\nsuffering from foot-and-mouth disease.  It was torture to us to learn\r\nthe kind of punishment to which they were subjected and the nature of the work\r\nthey were called upon to perform; these facts were stated to us\r\nin the presence of the prison officials, and they were communicated by us\r\nto the Native Affairs Department merely as a matter of course.\r\nBut what must be the effect of this brutal punishment upon girls\r\nwho knew only city life?  To our surprise, however, they vowed\r\nnever to buy passes, even if they had to come back.\r\n\r\nA month later, when we visited Bloemfontein, a majority of those\r\nwho were at the Kroonstad jail had already returned to their homes,\r\nand the family doctors were doing a roaring trade.  Their practice, too,\r\nwas most likely to continue to boom as the sufferers were still determined\r\nto buy no more women's passes.\r\n\r\nThis determination caused a white man to suggest that \"instead of being\r\nsent to prison with hard labour, these madcaps should be flogged\" --\r\nand this because the women refuse to be outraged by law.\r\n\r\nOur visit to Kroonstad took place just after the Circuit Court\r\nhad convicted the white superintendent of the Kroonstad Native Location\r\nfor an outrage upon a coloured woman.  He arrested her in the location\r\nostensibly because she could not produce her residential pass,\r\nand in the field between the location and the town through which\r\nhe had to escort her to prison he perpetrated the atrocity.\r\nIn sentencing him to four years' hard labour, the Chief Justice said\r\nfor a similar crime upon a white woman a black man would be liable\r\nto the death penalty.\r\n\r\nWhen General Botha assumed the portfolio of Native Affairs\r\nat the time of this trouble, the writer, as General Secretary of the Congress,\r\ntelegraphed to him the greetings of the South African Native Congress,\r\nand pointed out to him that over two hundred coloured women were at that time\r\nlanguishing in jail for resenting a crime committed upon them,\r\na crime which would have been considered serious in any other place\r\noutside the \"Free\" State.  The chivalrous General replied in a Dutch telegram\r\ncontaining this very courteous reply:  \"It shall be my endeavour, as hitherto,\r\nto safeguard the just interests of the inhabitants of this land\r\nirrespective of colour.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Botha's assurances are so sweet, especially when they are made\r\nto persons who are not in a position to influence his electoral support.\r\nThe Natives, who know the \"sweets\" of these assurances cannot be blamed if\r\nthey analyse the Premier's assurances in the light of their past experience,\r\nespecially the phrase \"as hitherto\".  To them it conveys but one idea, namely,\r\n\"If the future policy of the South African Government found it convenient\r\nto send coloured women to prison in order to please the ruling whites,\r\nthey will, AS HITHERTO, not hesitate to do so.\"\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of native women, it is deeply to be regretted that during\r\nthis year, while the Empire is waging a terrible war for the cause of liberty,\r\nHis Excellency the Governor-General in South Africa should have seen his way\r\nto issue a Basutoland Proclamation -- No. 3 of 1915.  This law decrees\r\nthat under certain penalties, no native woman will be permitted\r\nto leave Basutoland \"without the permission of her husband or guardian\".\r\nThe Proclamation on the face of it may look comparatively harmless,\r\nbut its operation will have wide and painful ramifications\r\namounting to no less than an entrenchment of the evils embraced\r\nin polygamy; and in carrying out this decree civilization\r\nwill have to join hands with barbarism to perpetuate the bondage,\r\nand accentuate the degradation, of Basuto women.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that no respectable Mosuto woman wants to leave\r\nher husband or guardian; but the economic conditions of to-day\r\npress very heavily on polygamous wives.  Their lord and master\r\nfinding himself no longer able to provide for half a dozen houses at a time,\r\nbestows on them the burden and anxieties of wifehood without its joys,\r\nnamely, a husband's undivided care and the comforts due to wives\r\nin monogamous marriages.\r\n\r\nSome of these polygamous wives have from time to time\r\nsought relief in emigrating to European centres where they could\r\nearn their own living and send food and raiment to their little ones.\r\nA woman cannot always be blamed for having entered into\r\na polygamous marriage.  More often than not, she did so in obedience\r\nto the wishes of her aged parents.  The old people, in many instances,\r\nhave judged present day economics from the standard of their own happy days\r\nwhen there was plenty of land and rainfalls were more regular;\r\nwhen the several wives and children of a rich cattle-owner\r\ncould always have enough grain, eat meat, drink milk and live happily.\r\nBut times are altered and even a monogamist finds the requirements of one wife\r\nquite a stupendous handful.  The country is so congested\r\nthat the little arable land left them yields hardly any produce.\r\nI have seen it suggested in official documents that sheep-breeding\r\nshould be limited in Basutoland as there is not enough grazing for the flocks.\r\nAnd under this economic stress these surplus wives are sometimes driven\r\nto accept the overtures of unscrupulous men who gradually induce them\r\nto wallow in sin; hence too, they give birth to an inferior type of Basuto.\r\n\r\nThat such a law should be adopted during the reign of Chief Griffith,\r\ntheir first Christian Chief and the first monogamist\r\nwho ever ruled the Basuto, is disappointing.  And while\r\nwe resent the policy of the British authorities in the Union,\r\nwho promote the interests of the whites by repressing the blacks,\r\nwe shall likewise object to an attempt on the part of the same authorities\r\nin the native territories to protect the comfort of black men by degrading\r\nblack women.  God knows that the lot of the black woman in South Africa\r\nis bad as it is.  One has but to read the report of the Commission recently\r\nappointed by the Union Government to inquire into cases of assault on women\r\nto find that their condition is getting worse.  Presumably the evidence\r\nwas too bad for publication, but the report would seem to show\r\nthat in South Africa, a country where prostitution was formerly unknown,\r\ncoloured women are gradually perverted and demoralized into a cesspool\r\nfor the impurities of the family lives of all the nationalities\r\nin the sub-continent.\r\n\r\nIn her primitive state, the native girl was protected against\r\nseduction and moral ruin by drastic penalties against the seducer,\r\nwhich safeguards have since the introduction of civilized rule\r\nbeen done away with.  With tribes just groping their way\r\nfrom barbarism towards civilization natural hygienic and moral laws\r\nhave been trampled upon, and for this state of affairs\r\nthe white man's rule is not wholly free from blame.  It should be a crime\r\nto defile a potential mother and a woman should continue to be regarded\r\nas the cradle of the race and her person remain sacred and inviolate\r\nunder the law, as was the case in former times.\r\n\r\nThe only charge that could be brought up against primitive native socialism\r\nwas that by tolerating polygamy it had incidentally legalized concubinage;\r\nbut taking all circumstances into consideration, it is doubtful\r\nif the systematic prostitution of to-day is a happy substitution\r\nfor the polygamy of the past.\r\n\r\nThere were no mothers of unwanted babies; no orphanages, because there were\r\nno stray children; the absence of extreme wealth and dire poverty\r\nprevented destitution, and the Natives had little or no insanity;\r\nthey had no cancer or syphilis, and no venereal diseases\r\nbecause they had no prostitutes.\r\n\r\nHave we not a right to expect a better state of affairs\r\nunder civilized European rule?\r\n\r\nIt is apparently in revolt of similar horrible conditions\r\nthat when the war broke out, British and Continental women\r\nwere fighting for the vote with a view to liberating their sex and race\r\nfrom kindred impurities, for the soul rises up in \"divine discontent\"\r\nagainst a state of affairs which no nation should tolerate -- evils to which\r\nthe coloured women of South Africa are now a prey.\r\n\r\nTo this kind of degeneracy may also be traced the undoing\r\nof the finer elements of the native social system, the undermining\r\nof their health and of the erstwhile splendid physique of the African race\r\nand the increasing loss of the stamina of our proverbially magnificent\r\nmen and women.  The effect of these evils and of the abuses\r\ninherent to the liquor traffic is manifest in several of the tribes\r\nwho are to-day but shadows of their former selves.\r\n\r\nThe safeguarding of our maidens and women folk from the evils of drink,\r\ngreed and outrages resulting from indefensible pass laws\r\nand the elimination of bad habits among men by a rightful policy\r\nwill restore that efficiency, loyalty, and contentment which aforetime\r\nwere the boast of pioneer administrators in British South Africa,\r\nand which if fostered will render them a magnificent asset to the Empire\r\nfor all time.\r\n\r\nBut as often as the coloured woman has been attacked she has humbly presented\r\n\"the other cheek\".  Evidence of her characteristic humility\r\nis to be found in the action of the coloured women of the \"Free\" State,\r\nwhose persecution by the South African Government, at the instance of certain\r\n\"Free\" State Municipalities, prompted the writing of this chapter.\r\nAfter the war broke out (the Bloemfontein `Friend' tells us)\r\nthe native women of that city forgot their own difficulties,\r\njoined sewing classes, and helped to send clothing to the afflicted Belgians\r\nin Europe.  Surely such useful members of the community deserve\r\nthe sympathy of every right-minded person who has a voice\r\nin the conduct of British Colonial administration; so let us hope\r\nthat this humble appeal on their behalf will not be in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII    At Thaba Ncho:  A Secretarial Fiasco\r\n\r\n  Man's inhumanity to man makes countless thousands mourn.\r\n                                       Burns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning of September, 1913, found us in the Lady Brand district.\r\nBesides numerous other sufferers of the land plague,\r\nthe writer was here informed of one case that was particularly distressing,\r\nof a native couple evicted from a farm in the adjoining district.\r\nAfter making a fruitless search for a new place of abode,\r\nthey took out a travelling pass to go to Basutoland with their stock.\r\nBut they never, so the story went, reached their destination.\r\nWe were told that they were ambushed by some Dutchmen,\r\nwho shot them down and appropriated their stock.  To a stranger\r\nthe news would have been incredible, but, being a Free Stater born,\r\nit sounded to us uncommonly like the occurrences that our parents said\r\nthey used to witness in the early days of that precious dependency.\r\nWe were further told that one of the Dutch murderers\r\nhad been arrested and was awaiting his trial at the next criminal sessions.\r\nAs both the native man and woman were shot, it seemed difficult to conceive\r\nhow the prosecution could find the necessary evidence to sustain\r\na charge of murder.\r\n\r\nThe trial duly came off at Bloemfontein a month or two later,\r\nand the evidence in court seemed more direct and less circumstantial\r\nthan we had expected.  For, not only were the stolen cattle found\r\nin the possession of the prisoner, but the bullet picked up\r\nnear the bodies of the dead refugees (according to the evidence\r\ngiven in court) fitted the prisoner's pistol.  General Hertzog\r\npersonally attended the court at Bloemfontein and conducted the defence;\r\nand, presumably more by his eloquence than anything else,\r\nhe convinced a white jury of the guiltlessness of the accused,\r\nwho was acquitted and acclaimed outside the court by his friends\r\nas a hero.  In justice to the police it must be added\r\nthat they re-arrested this man and charged him with the theft,\r\nor with being in possession of the deceased Natives' cattle.\r\nOn this charge the prisoner was convicted before the Circuit Court\r\na few months later, and in sentencing him to three years, with hard labour,\r\nthe presiding judge is said to have made some references\r\nto the previous trial and the manner in which the prisoner had escaped\r\nthe capital sentence.\r\n\r\nFrom Lady Brand we travelled south towards Wepener, not far\r\nfrom the Basuto frontier.  Evictions around here were numerous,\r\nbut beyond the inevitable hardships of families suddenly driven\r\nfrom home, they had not suffered any great amount of damage.\r\nBeing near to the Basuto border, a Native in these parts, when ejected,\r\ncan quickly take his stock across the boundary, and leaving them\r\nin friendly pastures, under sympathetic laws, go away to look for a new place.\r\nBut it became abundantly clear that the influx of outsiders into Basutoland\r\ncould not continue at the rate it was then proceeding\r\nwithout seriously complicating the land question in Basutoland,\r\nwhere chieftains are constantly quarrelling over small patches of arable land.\r\n\r\nA pitiable spectacle, however, was the sight of those who had been evicted\r\nfrom the centre of the Orange \"Free\" State.  It was heartrending\r\nto hear them relate the circumstances of their expulsions,\r\nand how they had spent the winter months roaming from farm to farm\r\nwith their famishing stock, applying in vain for a resting place.\r\nSome farmers were apparently sympathetic, but debarred from entertaining\r\nsuch applications by the sword of Damocles -- the 100 Pound fine\r\nin Section 5 of the Natives' Land Act -- they had perforce to refuse\r\nthe applicants.  The farms hereabout are owned by Boers and English settlers,\r\nbut many are owned by Germans, Jews, Russians, and other Continentals.\r\nSome of the proprietors do not reside on the farms at all;\r\nthey are either Hebrew merchants or lawyers, living in the towns and villages\r\naway from the farms.  Many have no wish to part with the Natives,\r\nwho seem invariably to have treated their landlords well,\r\nbut they are forced to do so by the law.\r\n\r\nIt seems a curious commentary on the irony of things that South Africa,\r\nwhich so tyrannically chases her own Natives from the country,\r\nreceives at this very time with open arms Polish, Finnish,\r\nRussian and German Jews, who themselves are said to have fled\r\nfrom the tyranny of their own Governments in Europe.  With a vengeance,\r\nit looks like \"robbing Peter to pay Paul\".\r\n\r\nStanding by the side of a kopje, very early on that September morning,\r\nit was a relief to see the majestic tops of the mountains of Basutoland,\r\nsilhouetted against the rising sun, beyond the Caledon River,\r\nwhich separates the \"Free\" State from Basutoland.\r\n\r\nA number of fugitives were at that time driving little lots of stock\r\nacross the broad and level flats which extend in the direction\r\nof the Basutoland Protectorate.  How comforting to know\r\nthat once they crossed the river, these exiles could\r\nrest their tired limbs and water their animals without breaking any law.\r\nReally until we saw those emaciated animals, it had never so forcibly\r\noccurred to us that it is as bad to be a black man's animal\r\nas it is to be a black man in South Africa.\r\n\r\nTo think that this \"Free\" State land from which these people are now expelled\r\nwas at one time, and should still be, part and parcel of Basutoland;\r\nand to remember that the fathers of these Natives, who are now fleeing\r\nfrom the \"Free\" State laws, were allies of the Boers, whom they assisted\r\nto drive the Basutos from this habitable and arable part of their land;\r\nthat with their own rations, their own horses, their own rifles,\r\nand often their own ammunition, they helped the Boers to force the Basutos\r\nback into their present mountain recesses, and compelled them\r\nto build fresh homes in all but uninhabitable mountain fastnesses,\r\nin many instances inaccessible to vehicles of any kind,\r\nin order (as was said at the time) to give themselves \"more elbow-room\";\r\nto see them to-day fleeing from the laws of their perfidious Dutch allies,\r\nexpelled from the country for which they bled and for which\r\ntheir fathers died; and to find that, at the risk of intensifying\r\ntheir own domestic problems in their now diminutive and overcrowded\r\nMountain State, the Basutos are nobly offering an asylum to those\r\nwho had helped to deprive them of their country; and to remember\r\nthat this mean breach of faith, on the part of ex-Republicans towards\r\ntheir native allies, is facilitated by the protection of the Union Jack,\r\nsheds, in regard to the Basutos, a glorious ray of light\r\nupon black human nature.\r\n\r\nLook at these exiles swarming towards the Basuto border, some of them\r\nwith their belongings on their heads, driving their emaciated flocks\r\nattenuated by starvation and the cold.  The faces of some of the children,\r\ntoo, are livid from the cold.  It looks as if these people\r\nwere so many fugitives escaping from a war, with the enemy pressing hard\r\nat their heels.\r\n\r\nIt was a distressing sight.  We had never seen the likes of it\r\nsince the outbreak of the Boer War, near the Transvaal border,\r\nimmediately before the siege of Mafeking.  Even that flight of 1899\r\nhad a buoyancy of its own, for the Boer War, unlike the present\r\nstealthy war of extermination (the law which caused this flight),\r\nwas preceded by an ultimatum.  But the sight of a people\r\nwho had loyally paid taxation put to flight in these halcyon times,\r\nby a Parliament the huge salaries of whose members these very exiles,\r\nalthough unrepresented in its body, have meekly helped to pay,\r\nturned one's weeping eyes to Heaven, for, as Jean Paul says, \"There above\r\nis everything he can wish for here below.\"  But if the Native of other days\r\nhas been sold by the perfidy of his Dutch allies of the day,\r\nthe British soldiers and British taxpayer of the present day\r\nhave been deceived by \"we don't know who\".  They fought and died and paid\r\nto unfurl the banner of freedom in this part of the globe,\r\nand the spectacle before us is the result.  This must be\r\nwhat A. H. Keene referred to when he said, \"The British public were also dumb,\r\nand with that infinite capacity for being gulled which is so remarkable\r\nin a people proud of their common sense, acquiesced in everything.\"\r\n\r\nVisiting the farms, we found some native tenants under notice to leave.\r\nWe informed them that Mr. Edward Dower, the Secretary for Native Affairs,\r\nwould be in Thaba Ncho the following week, and advised them\r\nto proceed to the town and lay their difficulties before\r\nthis high representative of the Union Government, with a request\r\nfor the use of his good offices to procure for them\r\nthe Governor-General's permission to live on farms,\r\na course provided in Section 1 of the Natives' Land Act.\r\nWe made no promises, as previous requests for such permission\r\nhad been invariably ignored.  But we hoped that the Government Secretary's\r\nmeeting with the sufferers and speaking with them face to face\r\nwould soften the implacable red-tape and official circumlocution,\r\nand perhaps even open the way towards a modification of the administration\r\nof this legislative atrocity; but we were mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe meeting duly took place on Friday, September 12, 1913.\r\nA thousand Natives gathered at the racecourse on the wide level country\r\nbetween the railway station and Thaba Ncho town.  A few historical facts\r\nrelative to Thaba Ncho might not be out of place.\r\n\r\nThaba Ncho (Mount Black) takes its name from the hill below which\r\nthe town is situated.  Formerly this part of Africa was peopled by Bushmen\r\nand subsequently by Basutos.  The Barolong, a section of the Bechuana,\r\ncame here from Motlhanapitse, a place in the Western \"Free\" State,\r\nto which place they had been driven by Mzilikasi's hordes from over the Vaal\r\nin the early 'twenties.  The Barolongs settled in Thaba Ncho\r\nduring the early 'thirties under an agreement with Chief Mosheshe.\r\nThe Seleka branch of the Barolong nation, under Chief Moroka,\r\nafter settling here, befriended the immigrant Boers who were on their way\r\nto the north country from the south and from Natal during the 'thirties.\r\nA party of immigrant Boers had an encounter with Mzilikasi's\r\nforces of Matabele.  Up in Bechuanaland the powerful Matabele\r\nhad scattered the other Barolong tribes and forced them\r\nto move south and join their brethren under Moroka.  Thus during the 'thirties\r\ncircumstances had formed a bond of sympathy between the Boers and Barolongs\r\nin their mutual regard of the terrible Matabele as a common foe.\r\n\r\nBut the story of the relations between the Boers and the Barolong\r\nneeds no comment:  it is consistent with the general policy of the Boers,\r\nwhich, as far as Natives are concerned, draws no distinction\r\nbetween friend and foe.  It was thus that Hendrik Potgieter's Voortrekkers\r\nforsook the more equitable laws of Cape Colony, particularly that relating\r\nto the emancipation of the slaves, and journeyed north to establish\r\na social condition in the interior under which they might enslave the Natives\r\nwithout British interference.  The fact that Great Britain\r\ngave monetary compensation for the liberated slaves did not apparently assuage\r\ntheir strong feelings on the subject of slavery; hence they were anxious\r\nto get beyond the hateful reach of British sway.  They were sweeping\r\nthrough the country with their wagons, their families, their cattle,\r\nand their other belongings, when in the course of their march,\r\nPotgieter met the Matabele far away in the Northern Free State\r\nnear a place called Vecht-kop.  The trekkers made use of their firearms,\r\nbut this did not prevent them from being severely punished by the Matabeles,\r\nwho marched off with their horses and live stock and left the Boers\r\nin a hopeless condition, with their families still exposed to further attacks.\r\nPotgieter sent back word to Chief Moroka asking for assistance,\r\nand it was immediately granted.\r\n\r\nChief Moroka made a general collection of draught oxen\r\nfrom amongst his tribe, and these with a party of Barolong warriors\r\nwere sent to the relief of the defeated Boers, and to bring them back\r\nto a place of safety behind Thaba Ncho Hill, a regular refugee camp,\r\nwhich the Boers named \"Moroka's Hoek\".  But the wayfarers\r\nwere now threatened with starvation; and as they were guests of honour\r\namongst his people, the Chief Moroka made a second collection of cattle,\r\nand the Barolong responded with unheard-of liberality.\r\nEnough milch cows, and sheep, and goats were thus obtained\r\nfor a liberal distribution among the Boer families, who, compared with\r\nthe large numbers of their hospitable hosts, were relatively few.\r\nHides and skins were also collected from the tribesmen,\r\nand their tanners were set to work to assist in making veldschoens (shoes),\r\nvelbroeks (skin trousers), and karosses (sheepskin rugs)\r\nfor the tattered and footsore Boers and their children.\r\nThe oxen which they received at Vechtkop they were allowed to keep,\r\nand these came in very handy for ploughing and transport purposes.\r\nNo doubt the Rev. Mr. Archbell, the Wesleyan Methodist missionary and apostle\r\nto the Barolong, played an active part on the Barolong Relief Committee,\r\nand, at that time, there were no more grateful people on earth\r\nthan Hendrik Potgieter and his party of stricken voortrekkers.\r\n\r\nAfter a rest of many moons and communicating with friends\r\nat Cape Colony and Natal, the Dutch leader held a council of war\r\nwith the Barolong chiefs.  He asked them to reinforce\r\nhis punitive expedition against the Matabele.  Of course they were to use\r\ntheir own materials and munitions and, as a reward, they were to retain\r\nwhatever stock they might capture from the Matabele; but the Barolongs\r\ndid not quite like the terms.  Tauana especially told Potgieter\r\nthat he himself was a refugee in the land of his brother Moroka.\r\nHis country was Bechuanaland, and he could only accompany the expedition\r\non condition that the Matabele stronghold at Coenyane (now Western Transvaal)\r\nbe smashed up, Mzilikasi driven from the neighbourhood\r\nand the Barolong returned to their homes in the land of the Bechuana,\r\nthe Boers themselves retaining the country to the east and the south\r\n(now the \"Free\" State and the Transvaal).  That this could be done\r\nTauana had no doubt, for since they came to Thaba Ncho, the Barolong had\r\nacquired the use of firearms -- long-range weapons -- which were still unknown\r\nto the Matabele, who only used hand spears.  This was agreed to,\r\nand a vow was made accordingly.  To make assurance doubly sure,\r\nTauana sent his son Motshegare to enlist the co-operation of a Griqua\r\nby the name of Pieter Dout, who also had a bone to pick with the Matabele.\r\n\r\nPieter Dout consented, and joined the expedition with a number of mounted men,\r\nand for the time being the Boer-Barolong-Griqua combination\r\nproved a happy one.  The expedition was successful beyond\r\nthe most sanguine expectations of its promoters.  The Matabele were routed,\r\nand King Mzilikasi was driven north, where he founded\r\nthe kingdom of Matabeleland -- now Southern Rhodesia -- having left the allies\r\nto share his old haunts in the south.\r\n\r\nThis successful expedition was the immediate outcome of the friendly alliance\r\nbetween the Boers in the \"Free\" State and Moroka's Barolong at Thaba Ncho.\r\nBut Boers make bad neighbours in Africa, and, on that account,\r\nthe Government of the \"Free\" State thereafter proved a continual menace\r\nto the Basuto, their neighbours to the east.  Pretexts were readily found\r\nand hostile inroads constantly engineered against the Basuto\r\nfor purposes of aggression, and the friendliness of the Barolong\r\nwas frequently exploited by the Boers in their raids,\r\nundertaken to drive the Basuto further back into the mountains.\r\nThis, however, must be said to the honour of the mid-nineteenth century\r\n\"Free\" Staters, in contrast to the \"Free\" Staters of later date:\r\nthat the earlier \"Free\" Staters rewarded the loyalty of their Barolong allies\r\nby recognizing and respecting Thaba Ncho as a friendly native State;\r\nbut it must also be stated that the bargain was all in the favour of one side;\r\nthereby all the land captured from the Basuto was annexed to the \"Free\" State,\r\nwhile the dusky warriors of Moroka, who bore the brunt of the battles,\r\ngot nothing for their pains.  So much was this the case that Thaba Ncho,\r\nwhich formerly lay between the \"Free\" State and Basutoland,\r\nwas subsequently entirely surrounded by \"Free\" State territory.\r\n\r\nEventually Chief Moroka died, and a dispute ensued between his sons\r\nconcerning the chieftainship.  Some Boers took sides in this dispute\r\nand accentuated the differences.  In 1884, Chief Tsipinare,\r\nMoroka's successor, was murdered after a night attack\r\nby followers of his brother Samuel, assisted by a party of \"Free\" State Boers.\r\nIt is definitely stated that the unfortunate chief valiantly defended himself.\r\nHe kept his assailants at bay for the best part of the day\r\nby shooting at them through the windows of his house,\r\nwhich they had surrounded; and it was only by setting fire to the house\r\nthat they managed to get the chief out, and shoot him.  As a matter of fact\r\nthe house was set on fire by the advice of one of the Boers,\r\nand it is said that it was a bullet from the rifle of one of these Boers\r\nthat killed Chief Tsipinare.\r\n\r\nPresident Brand, the faithful ally of the dead chieftain,\r\ncalled out the burghers who reached Thaba Ncho after the strife was over.\r\nHe annexed Thaba Ncho to the \"Free\" State, and banished the rival chief\r\nfrom \"Free\" State territory, with all his followers.\r\nThe Dutch members of the party which assassinated the chief\r\nwere put upon a kind of trial, and discharged by a white jury at Bloemfontein.\r\n\r\nOf course, Boers could not be expected to participate in any adventure\r\nwhich did not immediately lead to land grabbing.  But, fortunately for\r\nsome Barolongs, the dead chief had in his lifetime surveyed some farms\r\nand granted freehold title to some of the tribesmen.  In fact,\r\nhis death took place while he was engaged in that democratic undertaking.\r\nThe Boer Government, which annexed the territory, confiscated all the land\r\nnot yet surveyed, and passed a law to the effect that those Barolongs\r\nwho held individual title to land could only sell their farms to white people.\r\nIt must, however, be added that successive Boer Presidents\r\nhave always granted written exemptions from this drastic measure.\r\nSo that any Native who wanted to buy a farm could always do so\r\nby applying for the President's permission, while, of course,\r\nno permission was necessary to sell to a white man; several Natives,\r\nto the author's knowledge, have thus bought farms from Natives,\r\nand also from white men, by permission of the State President,\r\nand the severity of the prohibition was never felt.  But after\r\nthe British occupation in 1900, the Natives keenly felt this measure,\r\nas the Governor, when appealed to by a Native for permission to buy a farm,\r\nalways replied that he had no power to break the law.\r\nThus, under the Union Jack, sales have gone on from black to white,\r\nbut none from white to black, or even from black to black.\r\nIn the crowd which met Mr. Dower that morning were two Barolong young men\r\nwho had lately inherited a farm each under the will of their deceased uncle,\r\nand the law will not permit the Registrar of Deeds to give them title\r\nto their inheritance; their numerous representations to the Union authorities\r\nhave only met with promises, while lawyers have taken advantage of the hitch\r\nto mulct them in more money than the land is worth.  The best legal advice\r\nthey have received is that they should sell their inheritances to white men.\r\nNow the Natives' Land Act, as applied to the whole Union of South Africa,\r\nis modelled on these highly unsatisfactory conditions relating to land\r\nin the \"Free\" State.  The six months' imprisonment, the 100 Pounds fine,\r\nand other penalties for infringement of the Land Act, are borrowed from\r\nChapter XXXIV of the \"Free\" State laws, to which reference is made\r\nin Section 7 of the Natives' Land Act.  Section 8 of the Natives' Land Act\r\nis a re-enactment of some of the reprehensible \"Free\" State land laws\r\nwhich had been repealed by the Crown Colony Government\r\nafter the British occupation in 1900.  When the Natives' Land Bill\r\nwas before Parliament the Opposition moved that the remaining native farms\r\nbe scheduled as a native area, where Natives might purchase farms,\r\nof course from other Natives.  The passage of such an amendment\r\nwas more than could be expected as the real object of the Natives' Land Bill\r\nwas to block every possible means whereby a Native may acquire land\r\nfrom a Native, or from any one else; but when the motion was rejected\r\nthe Natives of Thaba Ncho were exceedingly alarmed.  They telegraphed\r\ntheir fears to Mr. Sauer, who promised to visit them when Parliament rose,\r\nbut his purpose was frustrated by his death, immediately after\r\nthe passage of the Act.\r\n\r\nTo return to Mr. Dower's meeting, the Native Affairs Secretary\r\nreceived a warm welcome from the Natives, who hoped that his coming\r\nwould show them a way out of their dilemma.  As already stated,\r\na thousand Natives came from the surrounding farms, some on horseback,\r\nothers on bicycles, and other conveyances such as carts, wagons, etc.;\r\nthey included evicted wanderers and native tenants under notice\r\nto leave their farms, with letters of eviction and other evidence\r\nin their pockets; they included some refugees, who had likewise been evicted\r\nfrom other districts -- refugees who, as one of them put it,\r\nwere \"constantly on the move, and hurried hither to plead for shelter\r\nfor our homeless families, now living in wagons.\"\r\n\r\nThe morning was showery.  Thaba Ncho Hill in the background,\r\nalways visible for scores of miles in every direction, towered high above\r\nthe surrounding landscape.  Its stony slopes covered with a light mist\r\nfrom peak to base, it stood like a silent witness to the outraged treaty\r\nbetween the Barolong and the Boers.\r\n\r\nMr. Dower, who was accompanied by his secretary (Mr. Apthorpe) and\r\nthe Thaba Ncho Magistrate (Major Robertson) and the Location Superintendent,\r\naddressed the Natives for half an hour.  The speeches were\r\ncorrectly interpreted by Mr. Jeremiah Makgothi, a native farmer,\r\nand formerly a local school teacher, who collaborated\r\nwith Canon Crisp in the translation of the Scriptures into Serolong\r\nfor the world-renowned S.P.C.K.  The Rev. P. K. Motiyane,\r\nthe local Wesleyan minister, also assisted in the task of interpretation.\r\n\r\nMr. Dower made some pathetic references to the life and work\r\nof the late Hon. J. W. Sauer, the great Cape politician\r\nwho had just passed away; then he proceeded to refer at length\r\nto sundry inconsequential topics of minor local significance;\r\nand, having repeated his great pleasure at seeing them,\r\nwithout making a single reference to the momentous measure\r\nthat was ravaging the Natives of the country, the Government Secretary\r\nresumed his seat amidst looks of astonishment and consternation\r\nfrom the assembled Natives.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. D. Goronyane, a gentleman who, as secretary to the late chiefs,\r\nplayed a leading part in the Boer-Barolong relations\r\nof the nineteenth century, was the next speaker.  He thanked the Secretary\r\nfor coming.  No people, he said, regretted Mr. Sauer's death\r\nmore than the Barolong; they had looked forward to meeting him\r\nin connexion with the new cloud now looming over the country\r\nin the shape of the Land Act, and they were sorry that his coming\r\nhad been frustrated by a Higher Power.  Turning to Mr. Dower, he said:\r\n\"All the people you see before you are frightened by the new law.\r\nThey have come here for nothing else but to hear how they are expected\r\nto live under it.\"\r\n\r\nOther speakers followed, but when the actual sufferers began\r\nto narrate their experiences there were so many who wished to come forward\r\nthat the leaders decided that, their cases being more or less similar,\r\nthey should wait and hear how the representative of the Government\r\nwould deal with the cases of those who had already spoken.\r\n\r\n==\r\n                               MR. DOWER'S REPLY\r\n\r\nHe regretted that, as one speaker had said, some people read the Act\r\nthrough the spectacles coloured by their desires.  Others seemed\r\nto be glad at the uncertainty and endeavoured to keep on turning\r\nthe wheel of discontent.  It was true that some people were imposing\r\non the Natives, but, on the whole, there was a reasonable desire\r\nto comply with the Act, although it was not always properly understood.\r\nFew individuals had been evicted, though many had received notice.\r\nSome of the notices given under a misapprehension, and with a desire\r\nnot to contravene the Act, had, since the Magistrates' explanations,\r\nactually been withdrawn.  \"So your best course is to explain the facts\r\nto your Magistrates, if possible, in the presence of the master.\"\r\n(A Voice:  \"Who'll bring him there?\")  After explaining\r\nthat the principle of the Act was a first step towards\r\nterritorial segregation, Mr. Dower said it gave protection\r\nto some parts of the country which formerly were not so protected.\r\nHe mentioned as an instance that more than one-half of the farms\r\nformerly owned by Natives in that district were no longer in their possession.\r\nIn other Provinces THE ACT WAS RESTRICTIVE, while IN THE FREE STATE\r\nIT WAS PROHIBITIVE.  The old practice of \"sowing on the halves\"\r\nmight continue so long as the lawfully executed contracts lasted;\r\nbut at the expiration of those contracts the practice should cease,\r\nas Parliament had decided on its abolition.  It amounted to a partnership\r\nbetween a white man and a black man.  With a civilized Native\r\nthe system might have been good, but a raw Native always got\r\nthe worst of the partnership.  He would advise them to make\r\nthe best temporary arrangements within the four corners of the law.\r\nIt might be by adopting one of three alternatives:  (1)  Become servants\r\n(in which case it would be legal for a master to give them pieces of land\r\nto plough and graze a number of stock); or (2) move into the reserve --\r\n(voices:  \"Where is the reserve?\"); or (3) dispose of the stock for cash.\r\n(Sensation.)  The arrangement would only be temporary until Parliament\r\ntook further steps in terms of the Commission's report.  It would be better\r\nthan trekking from pillar to post, till all the cattle had died out,\r\nand eventually returning penniless.  Farmers always had the right\r\nto evict their native tenants.  (A voice:  \"But we could go elsewhere.\")\r\nBecause some old laws which had been repealed had now been re-enacted,\r\nlet them not think that there was a desire to oppress.\r\n\"They may have been unjust, as you say, but understand that this law\r\nis not the last thing said by Parliament.  A final settlement must depend\r\non the recommendations of the Commission, and such action will be taken\r\nas will be to the lasting interests of white and black.\r\nThe Lands Commission has already held its first sitting,\r\nand you will be serving your best interests by bringing all your information\r\nto the Magistrate, so that it be laid before the Commission.\r\nShow by your wise action that you are inspired by the justice of your case.\r\nThe course of agitation will not help you.  Remove suspicions and mistrust\r\nfrom your minds, and bring cases of real hardships to the Magistrate,\r\nwho will see that this Act is administered as smoothly as possible.\r\nBut THE ACT DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR ANY SPECIAL CASES IN THE FREE STATE\r\nbeing submitted to the Governor-General under the first section of the Act.\"\r\n==\r\n\r\nThe concluding statement settled the minds of those who\r\nhad expected from the Government any protection against the law,\r\nand the disappointment under which the meeting broke up was indescribable.\r\nThis law is full of rude shocks, and this day this spokesman of the Government\r\ntold the Natives that in the other three Provinces the Governor-General\r\nwill only exercise his right in exceptional cases, while in the \"Free\" State\r\nthe law did not permit him to exercise it even in such cases,\r\nso that the Government alone knows why that provision was inserted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX      The Fateful 13\r\n\r\n  He hath disgraced me and laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains,\r\n    scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends,\r\n    heated mine enemies; and what is his reason?  I am a Kafir.\r\n  Hath not a Kafir eyes? hath not a Kafir hands, organs, dimensions,\r\n    senses, affections, passions?  Is he not fed with the same food,\r\n    hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases,\r\n    healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same summer and winter\r\n    as a white Afrikander?\r\n  If you prick us, do we not bleed?  If you tickle us, do we not laugh?\r\n    If you poison us, do we not die?  And if you wrong us,\r\n    shall we not revenge?  If we are like you in the rest,\r\n    we will resemble you in that.\r\n                                       Merchant of Venice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Natives of South Africa, generally speaking, are intensely superstitious.\r\nThe fact that they are more impressionable than tractable causes them,\r\nit seems, to take naturally to religion, and seems a flat contradiction\r\nof Junius's assertion that \"there are proselytes from atheism,\r\nbut none from superstition.\"  With some South African tribes\r\nit is unlucky to include goats amongst the animals paid\r\nby a young man's parents as the dowry for his bride; it was equally bad\r\nto pay dowry in odd numbers of cattle.  The payment must be made\r\nin an even number of oxen, sheep, or other animals or articles,\r\nsuch as two, four, six, eight, ten, and so on.  The man who could not afford\r\nmore than one sheep to seal the marriage contract would have\r\nto exchange his goat for a sheep to make up a presentable pair.\r\nIf he were too poor to do that, a needle or any other article\r\nwas admissible to make up the dowry to an even number,\r\nand so avoid giving one or three, or more odd numbers of articles.\r\nConscious as they were of the existence of some Supreme Being,\r\nbut worshipping no God, true or false, the white man's religion\r\nwhich makes such a worship obligatory through a mediator found easy access\r\namong so susceptible a people; and with equal ease they likewise adopted\r\nthe civilization of the white man.  But the Natives received\r\nnot only the white man's civilization and his religion,\r\nbut have even gullibly imbibed his superstitions.  Thus is\r\ntheir dread of the figure 13 accounted for.  The Native witch-doctors\r\nin the early days took advantage of their credulity, whilst civilized people\r\ntraded on their susceptibilities, and the semi-civilized Natives also traded\r\nupon the fears of their more impressionable brethren.\r\n\r\nTo give a concrete case or two, we might say that when\r\nthe main reservoir of the Kimberley waterworks was built,\r\none of the labourers one week-end lost the whole of his weekly pay.\r\nHe inquired, and searched everywhere he could think of,\r\nbut nobody had seen his missing purse.  But on Monday morning\r\nhe conceived a plan for the recovery of his lost purse.\r\nIn pursuance of this plan, on the Monday he asked for and obtained a day off;\r\nthen he declared to the gang of labourers that he was going\r\nto the nearest location to consult a bone-thrower.  Instead of going\r\nto the location, however, he went to the open country, gathered some plants,\r\nreturned to the dormitories while the others were at work, boiled the herbs\r\nin a pot of water and put it aside to cool.  When the workmen returned\r\nfor their midday meal he announced an imaginary consultation he had had\r\nwith the bone-thrower, and that that functionary had divined\r\nthe whereabouts of the purse; it was to the effect that the purse\r\nhad been stolen and was in the possession of a fellow-worker.\r\n\"The doctor,\" he said, \"gave me some herbs.  I have cooked them,\r\nand by his direction each of you is invited to immerse his hands\r\nin the decoction which is now cool.  If you are not the thief,\r\nnothing would happen to you, but to the one who has stolen my money,\"\r\nhe added with emphasis, \"the doctor said that the medicine\r\nwill snap the thief's fingers clean off and leave him only with the palm.\"\r\n\r\nOne by one the men dipped their hands in the \"medicine\",\r\nand as they took turns at the pot, one young fellow at length\r\nbecame visibly disturbed, and believing that the concoction was true,\r\nhe confessed to the theft and undertook to refund the money,\r\nrather than lose his fingers.\r\n\r\nAnother case was this.  \"A Transkeian missionary once heard\r\nof the serious indisposition of a Native.  It was not a natural sickness,\r\nit was believed, but was the effect of sorcery, and news in that sense\r\nwas noised abroad.  Such cases primitive Natives believe\r\nto be beyond the skill of a medical man.  White doctors,\r\nthey would say, know next to nothing at all about such things.\r\nThey do not believe in witchcraft and how could they be expected\r\nto be able to smell it out of a patient.  Only a witch-doctor\r\n-- if he is more skilful -- can smell out and subdue the charm\r\ndirected by another witch-doctor into the body of the bewitched.\r\n\r\nHaving heard this piece of native philosophy on witchcraft,\r\nthe missionary startled the Natives by telling them in their own tongue\r\nthat he could cure the disease.  And he did cure it.\r\nHe captured a baby lizard from the rocks which abound\r\nin the craggy undulations of most parts of the Transkei.\r\nHe hid it in the inside pocket of his coat and proceeded to the sick-bed\r\nwith some real medicines in his hand.  \"When a man who is not sick\r\nimagines himself sick,\" says Dr. Kellogg, \"he must be sick indeed,\"\r\nand truly, in accordance with this saying, the Native was dangerously ill.\r\nA bone-thrower, who had in the presence and hearing of the sick man\r\ndivined his malady, pronounced that he was not only bewitched by a snake,\r\nbut also that the reptile was within him and was eating him to death.\r\nIn these circumstances the missionary administered an emetic\r\nto the reluctant patient, in the presence of some incredulous spectators,\r\nwho had never known a white man to extract a reptile\r\nfrom the person of a bewitched Native.  Further, by some agility of the hand,\r\nthe missionary produced from his pocket unobserved, just as\r\nthe emetic was acting, the baby lizard he had taken from the rocks.\r\nSo smartly was this done that everybody, including the patient,\r\nbelieved the reptile to have been extracted from his body\r\nby the power of the medicine administered by the missionary.\r\nThe sick man at once stood up and walked, and the missionary was known,\r\nby all who witnessed the marvel, as the greatest witch-doctor\r\nof the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, when some civilized Christians made remarks\r\non New Year's Day about the figure 13, there was much gossiping\r\namong the more superstitious Natives as to the form of trouble\r\nwhich the year 1913 had in store for the Natives, although none knew\r\nthat a revolutionary law of Draconian severity would be launched\r\nin their midst during this eventful year.\r\n\r\nThe powerful African potentate, Menelik of Abyssinia\r\n(whose death had been falsely circulated no fewer than seven times\r\nduring the past dozen years), really died in 1913.\r\n\r\nLetsie II, paramount chief of the semi-independent Basuto nation,\r\ndeparted this life during this same year.\r\n\r\nDinizulu (son of the great Cetewayo, whose impis slew the Prince Imperial\r\nin 1879), who was born to inherit the throne of his fathers, and who lived\r\nto be one of the most disappointed men of his day, spent many years\r\nin prison and in exile, and was known in his lifetime as the Black Napoleon;\r\nwas released from prison by the Union Government, and given back\r\nhis pension of 500 Pounds per annum.  Sharing the hopes of his people\r\nthat in accordance with the Government's erstwhile good intentions\r\nnow tottering before a growing Republicanism, Zululand would be restored\r\nto the Zulus, and he established as their ruler under the Crown.  He, too,\r\ndied in the year 1913.\r\n\r\nAn unusually large number of good and noble men of greater or lesser renown\r\nwere gathered to their fathers during this year.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not generally known that few British statesmen\r\ndid so much for the South African Natives, in so short a term of service\r\nat the Colonial Office, as the Hon. A. Lyttleton.  And he, too, left us\r\nrather suddenly during this troublous year of 1913.  In this year, too,\r\nSouth Africa was visited by a drought which for severity was pronounced to be\r\nunprecedented in the knowledge of all the old inhabitants.\r\nRemarks -- some pithy, some ugly -- were made upon the drought by Dutchmen.\r\nThey all remembered how the God of their fathers used to send them\r\nnice soaking rains regularly each spring-time, and that it usually continued\r\nto nourish the plants and other of the country's vegetation\r\nthroughout the summer, and they concluded that there must be some reason\r\nwhy He does not do it now.  The majority of Dutchmen whom the writer\r\nthus overheard attributed the visitation to the sins of the foreigners,\r\nwho are fast buying up the country, and cursing it by settling godless people\r\nupon it.  One or two saw in it the vengeance of the Supreme Being\r\nfor the unnecessary persecution of His black creatures, but they were afraid\r\nto say this aloud.  \"See,\" said one, \"is the drought not worse\r\nin the `Free' State where Kafirs seem to be very hard hit by this new law?\"\r\nThis was true.  Dutchmen's cattle were dying of poverty in the \"Free\" State,\r\nand the land was so parched in some parts that it seemed difficult\r\nto believe that grass could ever grow in these places again,\r\nsupposing the long-looked-for rain came at last.\r\n\r\nOn our birthday, October 9, 1913, they hanged four murderers\r\nwho had been condemned to death at the preceding criminal sessions.\r\nThe selection of the morning of our birthday for the execution\r\nof four prisoners at our home was curious as executions in Kimberley\r\ntake place only about once or twice in ten years.  The event, of course,\r\nwas purely accidental; but middle-aged Natives seemed\r\nto have an aptitude for remembering catastrophes which,\r\nin the lives of their fathers and their fathers' fathers,\r\nfollowed such coincidences.  Whilst the executions were taking place,\r\non the morning of our birthday, an ugly ocean tragedy\r\nwas taking place away out on the Atlantic.  The `Vulturno' was ablaze\r\nwith a number of passengers on board.  Innocent white men and women\r\nwere being roasted alive, because the sea was too rough\r\nto permit their transfer from the burning ship to the rescuing liners;\r\nand so they perished, literally, \"between the devil and the deep sea\" --\r\nwithin full view of relief.\r\n\r\nDutchmen as a rule are like Natives in that they live as long as they can,\r\nand die only when they must; but in the Transvaal a Dutch farmer\r\nall but exterminated his family on this day with a revolver,\r\nwhich he had previously secured for the purpose.  On this day also\r\nthe mind of an English miner at Randfontein having suddenly become unhinged,\r\nhe shot his wife, his baby, and his aunt, then coolly pocketing the pistol,\r\nhe cycled down to the school, called out his two children,\r\nshot them down in cold blood, and retired to a quiet place\r\nwhere he put an end to his own life.  During that fateful week\r\nin which disaster followed disaster in rapid succession,\r\nthere occurred the following, namely, the colliery disaster at Cardiff,\r\nwhich left a thousand dependents without breadwinners, to say nothing\r\nof the damage to property, which is estimated at over 100,000 Pounds.\r\nThere were also railway accidents and aviation disasters,\r\ncausing damage to life and property.  There were commercial troubles\r\ndue to the Johannesburg strike in July, and this effect of the strike\r\nindicates the influence exercised by the \"golden city\"\r\nover South African commerce.  In that sad upheaval in the labour world\r\nmany innocent people lost their lives and property, and unfortunately,\r\nas is always the case, besides adding largely to the taxpayers' burdens,\r\nseriously affected people who had nothing to do with the strike.\r\nYet when some of our friends expressed thankfulness that the year did not have\r\nthirteen months, we were obstinate enough to refuse to waste valuable time\r\nin considering the subject.\r\n\r\nIndividuals, like communities, suffered heavily from one cause or another\r\nin the year 1913.  Thus the writer's little family also had\r\nits baptism of sorrow.  On New Year's Day of that year 1913,\r\nhis little boy, a robust child of three months, was prattling in the house.\r\nHe first saw the light in the last quarter of 1912, on the very day\r\nwe opened and christened our printing office, so we named him after\r\nthe great inventor of printing type:  he was christened Johann Gutenberg.\r\nSomehow or other he could never keep well after the New Year,\r\nfor though he tried to look pleasant, it was visibly\r\nunder serious difficulties.  It had been our fortune,\r\nduring a married life of fifteen years, to keep our children\r\nin remarkably good health; but the health of this little fellow\r\nshowed unmistakable evidence that this immunity was reaching its end.\r\nVehement attacks of whooping cough now overtook the little ones.\r\nThe others got rid of it during the winter months, but with Gutenberg\r\nthe disease developed into inflammation of this organ, and of that;\r\nand taking the whole year from January to December, it would not be too much\r\nto say that the little boy scarcely enjoyed three full months of good health.\r\nAnd by the end of the year it was clear that he was going the way\r\nof half a dozen cousins who were gathered into eternity\r\nall during one month -- December, 1913.  Before the New Year was a week old,\r\nthe doctor, who had then become a regular member of the family,\r\ngave us the final warning.\r\n\r\nFor a month past loving aunts had tenderly relieved the child's\r\ninexperienced parents of the daily ministrations and of the more exacting\r\nnight watches.  After the doctor's warning there came \"the calm\r\nbefore the storm\".  It only lasted for one day; the deceptive strength\r\nwhich had temporarily buoyed the little patient up was now passing away\r\nand the inevitable reaction was setting in.  Oh, if he were only a year older\r\nso that he could have communicated to us by speech his feelings and his wants!\r\nHis little body, which stood the long sickness with such fortitude, got frail.\r\nHis bright eyes, high forehead and round cheeks remained, however, to defy\r\nthe waste of the disease.  The parson came and uttered words of encouragement.\r\n\"Symptoms of death,\" he said, pointing to the sick-bed\r\n(and he was no novice in such matters) \"were very far from there,\"\r\nbut the surroundings of the sick-bed seemed to us to ring out the command\r\nwith a force as strong as six peals of thunder, saying \"Suffer little children\r\nto come unto Me,\" and such Divine orders, comprehensible only to those\r\nto whom they are issued, took precedence of any words of encouragement\r\nthat may be uttered by a mortal minister of religion.\r\nThat these good men of God know the ways of their Master is patent\r\nin that they always couple the encouragement to the sick,\r\nor to the friends of the sick, with the advice to surrender\r\nto the Divine injunction.  The grandmother of the child was composed.\r\n\"When the Lord's will is to be done,\" she said, \"no mortal can stay it,\"\r\nbut his aunts were restless.  \"Go, call the doctor at once,\"\r\nthey demanded.  He came, gave a solemn look and stood silent.\r\nAfter feeling the pulse he said:  \"The child has collapsed.\r\nI have done all I could and can do no more.\"  Next came the anxious looks\r\nof the other attendants, the footfalls of inquiring neighbours,\r\nmessages to nearer and further relatives about the pronounced \"collapse\".\r\n\r\nThis was at noon, and each one expected that he could hold out for two hours\r\nat the most; but he breathed throughout the afternoon with a gallantry\r\nthat was wonderful in its way.  His large round eyes turned upward\r\nas though they had become blind to their immediate surroundings.\r\nIt seemed that those eyes could no longer see the objects in the room\r\nand its anxious inmates; truly they could no longer see\r\nthe sun or the moon and stars that night.  Kimberley was no longer a home\r\nto the little chap whose short lease of life was clearly drawing to an end.\r\nA new outlook seemed to have dawned over his now brightening face.\r\nHis eyes were riveted on the New Jerusalem, the City of God,\r\nand he seemed to be in full communion with the dear little cousins\r\nwho preceded him thither during the previous month.  Evidently they\r\nwere beckoning him to leave this wicked South Africa and everything in it,\r\nand come to eternal glory.  In this condition we left him\r\nearly in the afternoon to answer the call of our daily and nightly drudgery\r\n-- it would be gross extravagance to call it \"duty\" -- an occupation\r\nwhich has no reverence for mournful occasions.  At 9.15 p.m.,\r\njust about the time of his birth sixteen months before, the little soul\r\nwas relieved of its earthly bonds.\r\n\r\nThere he lay robed in a simple white gown, his motionless form\r\nbeing an eloquent testimony of the indelible gap left in our domestic circle\r\nas a visitation of 1913.  But the celestial expression of his face,\r\nhis deep-brown colour, and his closed eyelids, seemed to say to us:\r\n\"Be at ease, I have conquered.\"\r\n\r\nStill, it must be confessed that to us this wrench was\r\na most painful experience, and that the doctrine of \"Thy will be done\"\r\nwas found to be a great deal more than a mere profession of faith.\r\nThe sympathies of relatives, friends, and other mourners,\r\ntheir deeds and words of condolence, followed by a solemn religious service,\r\ntook the sting out of the affliction, although it must again be confessed\r\nthat so deep was our sorrow for the dead child's mother that for some time\r\nwe could not bear to look her in the face.\r\n\r\nPainful and unusual solemnities and formulae were gone through\r\nduring the next day, and these again were lightened by\r\nthe kind and sympathetic assistance of genuine friends,\r\nlike Messrs. Joseph Twayi, H. S. Poho, and others, some of them delegates\r\nto a Temperance Conference then sitting in Kimberley.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of the pastors of St. Paul's Mission, who were both\r\nattending the annual synod at Pniel, two Wesleyan ministers --\r\nRev. Jonathan Motshumi of Kimberley, and Rev. Shadrach Ramailane of Fauresmith\r\n-- took charge of the funeral service, and a row of carriages\r\nfollowed the hearse to the West End Cemetery.\r\n\r\nAs the procession turned round Cooper's corner into Green Street, Kimberley,\r\nsomething caused us to look out of the carriage window;\r\nwe then caught sight of one of the carriages that formed the procession\r\nin which some little girl friends and relatives of the deceased were driving,\r\ntheir plain white dresses relieved only by a scrap of black ribbon\r\nhere and there.  Their silent sympathy, expressed with\r\ngirlish shyness, was evident, though their snow-white dresses\r\nwere in striking contrast to the colour of their carriage and of the horses,\r\nand the sombre black of the rest of the funeral party.\r\nAs we saw the solemn procession and heard the clank of the horses' hoofs,\r\nwe were suddenly reminded of that journey in July, 1913,\r\nwhen we met that poor wandering young family of fugitives\r\nfrom the Natives' Land Act.  A sharp pang went through us,\r\nand caused our heart to bleed as we recalled the scene of their night funeral,\r\nforced on them by the necessity of having to steal a grave\r\non the moonless night, when detection would be less easy.\r\nEvery man in this country, we thought, be he a Russian,\r\nJew, Peruvian, or of any other nationality, has a claim\r\nto at least six feet of South African soil as a resting place after death,\r\nbut those native outcasts, who in the country of their birth,\r\nas a penalty for the colour of their skin, are made by the Union Parliament\r\nto lead lives like that awarded to Cain for his crime of fratricide,\r\nthey might, as in the case of that wandering family, be even denied\r\na sepulchre for their little ones.\r\n\r\nThe solemnity of the funeral procession, of which we formed the mainmast,\r\nalmost entirely disappeared from our mind, to be succeeded\r\nby the spirit of revolt against this impious persecution\r\nas these things came before us.  What have our people done\r\nto these colonists, we asked, that is so utterly unforgivable,\r\nthat this law should be passed as an unavoidable reprisal?\r\nHave we not delved in their mines, and are not a quarter of a million of us\r\nstill labouring for them in the depths of the earth in such circumstances\r\nfor the most niggardly pittance?  Are not thousands of us\r\nstill offering up our lives and our limbs in order that South Africa\r\nshould satisfy the white man's greed, delivering 50,000,000 Pounds\r\nworth of minerals every year?  Have we not quarried the stones,\r\nmixed, moulded and carried the mortar which built the cities of South Africa?\r\nHave we not likewise prepared the material for building the railways?\r\nHave we not obsequiously and regularly paid taxation every year,\r\nand have we not supplied the Treasury with money to provide free education\r\nfor Dutch children in the \"Free\" State and Transvaal, while we had to find\r\nadditional money to pay the school fees of our own children?\r\nAre not many of us toiling in the grain fields and fruit farms,\r\nwith their wives and their children, for the white man's benefit?\r\nDid not our people take care of the white women -- all the white women,\r\nincluding Boer fraus -- whose husbands, brothers and fathers were away\r\nat the front -- in many cases actively engaged in shattering our own liberty?\r\nBut see their appreciation and gratitude!  Oh, for something to --\r\n\r\n    Strike flat the thick rotundity o' the world!\r\n    Crack Nature's moulds, all germins spill at once!\r\n        That make ungrateful man!\r\n\r\nWhen one is distressed in mind there is no greater comforter\r\nthan an appropriate Scriptural quotation.  Our bleeding heart\r\nwas nowhere in the present procession, which apparently\r\ncould take care of itself, for we had returned in thought\r\nto the July funeral of the veld and its horrid characteristics;\r\nand a pleasant reaction set in when we recalled a verse of Matthew which says:\r\n\"The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests,\r\nbut the Son of Man hath not where to lay His head.\"  How very Christlike\r\nwas that funeral of the veld.  It resembled the Messiah's\r\nin that it had no carriages, no horses, no ordained ministers,\r\nnor a trained choir singing the remains into their final resting place.\r\nThe veld funeral party, like the funeral party of the Son of Man,\r\nwas in mortal fear of the representatives of the law; it, like that party,\r\nhad not the light of the sun, nor the light of a candle,\r\nwhich charitable friends in our day would usually provide\r\nfor the poorest of the poor under ordinary circumstances.\r\nStill, it was not cold at Golgotha, or should not be to-day\r\nas it was on the first Good Friday; but even the Madonna and the disciples\r\nmust have had some house in which to gather to discuss the situation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most astounding things in connexion with\r\nthe unjust treatment of the Natives by the Whites of South Africa\r\nis the profound silence of the Dutch Reformed Church,\r\nwhich practically is now the State Church of South Africa.\r\nThis Christian body does not only exclude coloured worshippers\r\nfrom participating in its services, but would arraign them before the law,\r\nor otherwise violently assault them should they visit its places of worship\r\nat other times.\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that the predikants of the Dutch Reformed Church\r\nin the old Republics dare not pronounce the benediction\r\non a coloured congregation, we think it will not be considered\r\nunfair to say that the calculatingly outrageous treatment\r\nof the coloured races of South Africa by the Boer section of that community\r\nis mainly due from the sanction it receives from the Dutch Reformed Church.\r\nIf the predikants of the Dutch Reformed Church would\r\nbut tell their congregations that it was gross libel on the Christian faith,\r\nwhich they profess, to treat human beings as they treat those\r\nwith loathsome disease -- except when it is desired to exploit the benefits,\r\nsuch as their taxes and their labour which these outraged human beings\r\nconfer upon the Dutch:  we say that if the predikants\r\nwould but instruct their congregations so, then this stain,\r\nwhich so greatly disfigures the Christian character of the Boers\r\nwould be removed.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch almost worship their religious teachers; and they will continue\r\nthese cruelties upon the Natives as long as they believe that they have\r\nthe approval of the Church.  Let the predikants then tell their people\r\nthat tyranny is tyrannical even though the victims are of a different race,\r\nand the South African Dutch will speedily abandon that course.\r\n\r\nJust two instances by way of illustration.  Ten years ago we attended\r\nan election meeting at Burghersdorp, a typical Dutch constituency at the Cape.\r\nThe present Minister of Railways and Harbours was wooing the constituency,\r\nand he appeared to be the favourite candidate among three others.\r\nDutchmen from the surrounding farms flocked to attend the meeting.\r\nThe speeches were all in the Taal.  No hall in the town was large enough\r\nto hold the number that came, so the four candidates addressed the gathering\r\nin the Market Square.  This was how Mr. Burton asked the Dutch electors\r\nfor their votes:  \"Whenever you speak of making South Africa comfortable\r\nto Afrikanders, do not forget that the blacks are the original Afrikanders.\r\nWe found them in this country, and no policy can possibly succeed which aims\r\nat the promotion of the interests of one section of the Afrikander race\r\nto the neglect of another section.\"\r\n\r\nThere were a few native listeners in the throng, and we blacks\r\nat once thought that the speaker had held out the red-rag to the bull,\r\nand that every word of this candid statement would cost him\r\nat least fifty Dutch votes.  But we were agreeably surprised,\r\nfor the open air rang with the loud cheers and \"Hoor, hoors\"*\r\nfrom hundreds of leather-lunged Boers.  One old farmer turned round to Tommy\r\n-- the blackest Native in the crowd -- held him by the shoulders,\r\nand shouted as brusquely as his tongue could bend to the vernacular:\r\n\"Utloa, utloa, utloa!\"**\r\n\r\n--\r\n* \"Hear, hear\", in Dutch.\r\n** \"Hear, hear\", in Sesuto.\r\n--\r\n\r\nMr. Burton was returned at the head of the poll.\r\n\r\nA more recent instance:  In 1913, the South African Asiatic laws\r\noperated so harshly against British Indians that Westminster and Bombay\r\ndemanded instant reform.  In deference to this outside intervention\r\nthe Union Government appointed the Solomon Commission\r\nto inquire into the matter.  While the investigations were in progress,\r\nemphatic protests were constantly uttered against this \"outside interference\".\r\nSome of the South Africans went as far as to assert that \"if Imperialism\r\nmeant a `coolie'* domination in South Africa, then it was about time\r\nthat South Africa severed her Imperial bonds.\"  The clamourers\r\nwho designated the inquiry as a concession to outsiders\r\nseemed almost to dictate to the Commission not to recommend anything\r\nthat \"savours of a surrender to the coolies\".*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* A contemptuous South African term for British Indians.\r\n--\r\n\r\nBut when General Smuts, in terms of the Commission's report\r\nand as a concession to Anglo-Indian feeling, tabled a Bill in 1914,\r\nto amend the hardships before they had been a year in operation, the clamour\r\nat once died down; and we have not heard that any one in South Africa\r\nwas a penny the poorer as a result of this \"outside interference\",\r\nand its consequent \"surrender to the coolies\".\r\n\r\nDutchmen only follow their leaders.  Hence, let the leaders\r\ndirect them into cruel ways as they are seemingly doing\r\nat the present time, then if Mr. Burton's assertions be right\r\n(and we think no one will deny that he is right when he says\r\nthe one-sided policy can never succeed), these leaders,\r\ninstead of producing a South Africa which is rich and contented,\r\nwill only succeed in producing a South Africa which is poor and discontented.\r\nThose, too, who wish well for South Africa and are at the same time\r\nsympathizers of the present Government, let them also strive to induce\r\nthe Ministry to cease its policy of dilly-dallying and of equivocation\r\nat the expense of the coloured tax-payers.  So that the Dutch\r\nthroughout South Africa, as did the Dutch of Cape Colony,\r\nunder the able leadership of Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr, may pursue a fresh course --\r\nthe course of political righteousness.  When the Labour Party discover\r\nthat white votes alone will not give it the reins of Government, its leaders\r\nwill most probably advocate a native franchise in the Northern Colonies\r\nsimilar to the native franchise of the Cape.  And we can assure them\r\nthat the first man who would successfully tackle such a problem\r\nwill not only secure for his party the votes thus created,\r\nbut that sheer gratitude will in future place at his disposal\r\nthe coloured vote of the Cape as well.\r\n\r\nIt is also our belief, in regard to the Dutch, that if a trusted leader\r\nfrom among them were to propose a native franchise for the Northern Provinces,\r\nthe proposal would ultimately be accepted.\r\n\r\nThe predikants of the Dutch Reformed Church, who largely influence\r\nthe leadership of the South African Dutch, ought to know\r\nthat the English colonist can be just as devilish as the Boers\r\non questions of colour; and that some of them, with their\r\nsuperior means and education have almost out-Boered the Boer in this matter;\r\nbut that even they have been held in check by the restraint\r\nimposed upon them by the English Churches in the country.\r\nThus, knowing the Dutchman's obedience to the commands of his pastor,\r\nwe are afraid that if ever there come a day of reckoning\r\nfor the multifarious accumulation of wrongs done to the Natives,\r\nthe Dutch Reformed Church, owing to its silent consent to all these wrongs,\r\nwill have a lot to answer for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X       Dr. Abdurahman, President of the A.P.O. /\r\n                  Dr. A. Abdurahman, M.P.C.\r\n\r\n  (Native of the Cape, and M.B.C. of Edinburgh)\r\n\r\n  President of the African Political Organization\r\n    on the South African Colour Trouble\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following presidential address was delivered by Dr. Abdurahman\r\nat Kimberley on September 29, 1913, at the opening of the tenth annual\r\nConference of the A.P.O.  His Worship Councillor E. Oppenheimer,\r\nMayor of Kimberley, presided: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nNearly two years have elapsed since we last met in Conference --\r\ntwo years crowded with events that have an important bearing\r\non the future of South Africa, and especially on the Coloured races.\r\nThanks, however, to the A.P.O. newspaper, every intelligent Coloured man is\r\nacquainted with those events, and there is no need for me to dwell in detail\r\non any one of them.  Nevertheless, a cursory enumeration will be desirable\r\nin order to answer certain questions I propose to submit to you:  it will be\r\nfurther necessary to make a retrospect of the conditions that prevailed\r\nat the time when White South Africa, amid exuberant exultations,\r\nand a chorus of hosannahs, wildly welcomed the Act of Union\r\nas a beacon light, that would blaze down through ages of history,\r\nindicating the commencement of peace and prosperity for the land,\r\nand the birth of a new nation -- the foundation of a new nationalism.\r\n\r\nUshered in by its authors with the blare of trumpets,\r\nand with an incense of self-adulation for their vaunted achievement,\r\nit surely cannot have belied their sanguine hopes, and proved to have been\r\nnothing more than a dream of Alnaschar.  Whether Europeans\r\nare wholly satisfied with the results of Union is their business;\r\nbut I think we are warranted in looking for some indication\r\nof the fruits of that Act from our point of view.  But, before doing so,\r\nlet us take a cursory glance at the condition of the Coloured races\r\nin pre-Union days, and then, after a rapid review of the legislation\r\nsince that memorable date, we will ask ourselves:  How have those events\r\nimpressed the minds of the Coloured races, and what is our duty\r\nto ourselves and to our country?\r\n\r\nSuch are the questions that I propose to put myself to-night,\r\nand I shall endeavour to answer them in the most candid and straightforward\r\nmanner possible.  Justice and equity are our demands --\r\nare inherent rights of every man, especially a free-born British subject,\r\neven in South Africa.  Heedless, therefore, as to whether some of our views\r\nplease or displease the privileged section of this country's population,\r\nwe are in duty bound to speak out our honest convictions\r\nboldly and fearlessly.  I shall endeavour to state my opinions, therefore,\r\nwithout any heat, but with a cold, passionless calmness that is possible\r\nonly to those who, despite bitter experiences, base their remarks\r\non stern facts and undeniable realities.\r\n\r\nOf late, it has become the fashion in the Press of the Union\r\nto dub any one who has to utter unpleasant truths an emotionalist.\r\nThat is, of course, not argument.  The silent suffering of years\r\nthat must have been undergone by the Coloured man in South Africa\r\nis not likely to have left much of the emotional side of humanity\r\nin his composition.  However, unpalatable as the facts may be\r\nthat I have to present for your consideration to-night,\r\nI trust that my critics will be honest enough on this occasion\r\nto face them boldly.  They may question their accuracy, if they will,\r\nor dispute the validity of my deductions from these facts.\r\nThat is the honest course for them to adopt.  Furthermore, I trust that\r\nWhite South Africa, especially those who boast loudest of British traditions,\r\nwill remember that it is an inalienable right of a British subject,\r\nno matter in what part of the Empire he may be, to address his fellow-subjects\r\non the momentous question of Government.  \"If,\" declared an English lawyer,\r\n\"no man could have awakened the public mind to the errors and the abuses\r\nin our English Government, how could it have passed on from stage to stage,\r\nthrough reformation and revolution, so as to have arrived from barbarism\r\nto such a pitch of happiness and perfection?\"  Such an inquiry\r\nas I now propose will not be without its lessons.  If South Africa\r\nis worthily fulfilling her mission; if she has been faithful to her trust;\r\nif she is promoting the cause of civilization, and if her actions\r\nare based upon humanitarianism, then she may strenuously and conscientiously\r\nproceed on the course she has been following.  But if it can be shown\r\nthat there is no ethical basis to her policy of dealing with Coloured races,\r\nthat humanitarianism as a dominating factor is invariably wanting, and that\r\nunderlying her present policy is the principle of class aggrandizement,\r\nthen we may urge her to halt ere it is too late, and pursue another course.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Cape Colony\r\n\r\nNow although there never was a time when the white and the black races\r\nstood on a footing of practical equality -- civilly and politically --\r\nit is a fact that, under the old Cape constitution, theoretical equality\r\nwas ensured to all, irrespective of race or creed.  The Coloured races were,\r\nin this Colony, treated with much consideration, if not with\r\nabsolute equality.  The advancement made by them under that regime was always\r\nheld up to the world's admiration.  It was regarded as convincing proof\r\nthat a policy based upon justice was the right one to be followed\r\nin governing subject races.  The peaceful habits of the Coloured races\r\nsince the granting of the old Cape Constitution is a complete vindication\r\nof the broad liberalism entertained by English statesmen sixty years ago.\r\n\"It is the earnest desire of Her Majesty's Government that all her subjects\r\nat the Cape, without distinction of class or colour, should be united\r\nby one bond of loyalty, and we believe that the exercise of political rights\r\nenjoyed by all alike will prove one of the best methods of attaining\r\nthis object.\"  Thus reads the dispatch of the Duke of Newcastle to\r\nGovernor Cathcart, when transmitting \"to the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope\r\nOrdinances which confer one of the most liberal constitutions enjoyed\r\nby any of the British possessions.\"\r\n\r\nBut even in the Cape, prior to Union, signs were not wanting that\r\nsome slight reactions had set in.  By degrees the doctrine of equal rights,\r\nwhich formed the basis of the Cape Constitution, despite its resuscitation\r\nby the famous declaration of the great Rhodes, was losing its force.\r\nHowever, in the face of minor infractions of the principle of equal rights,\r\nand some invasions of the necessary corollary to that principle, the right\r\nto equal opportunity -- in the industrial as well as in the political world --\r\nwe were not wholly dissatisfied with the White man's rule in the Cape.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Northern Colonies\r\n\r\nNow let us consider the position in the Northern Colonies, especially in\r\nthe misnamed Free State.  There a very different picture is presented.\r\nFrom the days that the voortrekkers endeavoured to escape English rule,\r\nfrom the day that they sought the hospitality of Chief Moroka,\r\nthe history of the treatment of the blacks north of the Orange River\r\nis one long and uninterrupted record of rapine and greed,\r\nwithout a solitary virtue to redeem the horrors which were committed\r\nin the name of civilization.  Such is the opinion any impartial student\r\nmust arrive at from a study even of the meagre records available.\r\nIf all were told, it would indeed be a blood-curdling tale,\r\nand it is probably well that the world was not acquainted\r\nwith all that happened.  However, the treatment of the Coloured races,\r\neven in the Northern Colonies, is just what one might expect\r\nfrom their history.  The restraints of civilization\r\nwere flung aside, and the essentials of Christian precepts ignored.\r\nThe northward march of the voortrekkers was a gigantic plundering raid.\r\nThey swept like a desolating pestilence through the land,\r\nblasting everything in their path, and pitilessly laughing at the ravages\r\nfrom which the native races have not yet recovered.  Their governments\r\nwere founded on the principle that is subversive of all Christian ethics,\r\nthat the Coloured man was entitled to no recognition\r\neither in Church or State.  Cruelty and oppression amounting to serfdom were,\r\nand still are, the outstanding features of the Free State.\r\nAnd he would be a bold man who would assert that the native races\r\nhave progressed at all as a result of contact with the white man\r\nin the Free State.  Progress could not be looked for under such circumstances,\r\nfor nowhere are there any signs that the Free State was ever inspired\r\nby altruistic motives.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of things at the time of Union.  Injustice, repression,\r\nand inhumanity characterized the treatment of the Coloured races in the north:\r\njustice, benevolence, and equality of opportunity in the south.\r\nNow, it is said that \"where slavery is prohibited, there civil liberty\r\nmust exist; where civil liberty is denied, there slavery follows.\"\r\nThese maxims, every student of history will admit, have been\r\nabundantly verified in the history of South Africa.  Take, for instance,\r\na comparison of the condition of the Coloured people of this town\r\nand that of Bloemfontein, the capital of the Orange Free State.\r\nYour member of Parliament has stated that in Kimberley our people are a credit\r\nto the district, and the most advanced and progressive Coloured people\r\nin South Africa.  This is no doubt due to the excellent educational facilities\r\nwith which you have been provided for some considerable time,\r\nto the liberty and freedom you enjoy, and to the kindly treatment\r\nyou have received at the hands of the Europeans.  In Bloemfontein,\r\non the other hand, there are practically no educational facilities\r\nfor children, who, as soon as they reach the age of fifteen,\r\nmust enter the service of a white man, or be cast into prison.\r\nThere is no freedom, no liberty, and the result is that\r\nthe Coloured people of the capital of that British Slave State\r\nare uneducated, poor, and degraded.\r\n\r\nHere, then, one can easily see the results produced by\r\nthe two different systems of governing Coloured races --\r\nthe benevolent and the despotic.  In the north the denial of civil rights\r\nproduced a state of virtual slavery, and the recent denial\r\nof the complete enfranchisement of the Coloured people in the Union\r\nhas similarly resulted in the passing of an Act -- the Natives' Land Act,\r\nwhich means nothing less than the partial enslavement of the races\r\nthroughout the Union.  With two such divergent policies in force\r\nin South Africa, it is not surprising that the Coloured races\r\nviewed with the gravest apprehension the Union of the Colonies upon a basis\r\nwhich would give the Northern Colonies sufficient power and influence\r\nto shape the legislation of the Union.  And I have no hesitation\r\nin declaring that when Union was accomplished, and the Coloured people\r\nwere partially disfranchised, the death-knell of political equality\r\nfor the Coloured races was sounded, and the triumph of the north\r\nover the south was heralded.\r\n\r\nSincere regrets were expressed by our friends at the abridgement of our rights\r\nand the curtailment of our privileges that were effected\r\nby the South Africa Act.  Fervent hopes were entertained\r\nby Cape politicians that not only would we not suffer any injustice,\r\nbut the position of the Coloured races in the north would be improved,\r\nand their rights eventually be admitted.  They fondly believed\r\nthat the leavening influence of the Cape ideas would mitigate\r\nthe barbarity of those of the northerner.  We had no reason to doubt\r\nthe sincerity of our friends' beliefs, but we had no faith\r\nin the northerners -- men whose public professions and practice\r\nwere void of a vestige of justice or honour in their dealings\r\nwith the Coloured races.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1904, when the question of Union was under discussion,\r\nI expressed myself thus:  \"In a central Parliament there would be\r\nthe danger of the policies of the north slowly creeping into our Colony,\r\nand undermining our Constitution.  The men of the north have already told us\r\nwhat they would do if they got into power; and European friends,\r\nnumerous and influential as they might be, would not be able\r\nto safeguard the interests of the Coloured people.\"  How far\r\nthat prediction has been verified is well known to every Coloured man.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Coloured man at the time of the Union\r\nwas such as I have described.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Since Union\r\n\r\nScarcely had the blessing of the Almighty been invoked on the proceedings\r\nof the Union Parliament at the opening of its first session when,\r\nto its eternal shame and infamy, it placed upon its statute book a law\r\nthat would debar Christ Himself from membership of the Dutch Reformed Church.\r\nA Parliament capable of such blasphemy is capable of any iniquity.\r\n\r\nThen followed the Marriage Bill and the Squatters' Bill,\r\nboth abortive measures, but, nevertheless, showing clearly\r\nthe attitude of mind of the white rulers towards the Coloured races.\r\nIn order to find employment for poor whites, Coloured railway employees\r\nwho had served the country faithfully and well were dismissed.\r\nA white South Africa has been declared in the Union Parliament\r\nand from every platform.  The white race must preserve its dominance.\r\nTo this end a rigorous policy of repression was adopted;\r\nand the enthusiastic hopes of an extension of franchise rights\r\nto our northern fellow-men, that was entertained by Cape politicians\r\nand the Imperial Parliament, is now as far distant as the Greek Kalends.\r\nI shall not recount the long catalogue of other persecutions and injustices.\r\nWe have all felt some of them in one phase of life or other.\r\n\r\nSo serious had matters become in 1911 that in my warning to the Coloured races\r\nagainst the dangers that such a policy must entail, I was bold enough\r\nto declare at our Johannesburg Conference that when Europeans were ready\r\nthey would enter upon a war of extermination.  I was severely taken to task\r\nfor imputing such inhuman motives to Europeans.  I was denounced\r\nin even worse language than has been used towards the labour leaders\r\nin the recent strike.  No vituperative epithet was strong enough\r\nto fling at my head.  My statement met with almost universal condemnation\r\nat the hands of the editors of the white Press; but it was condemned\r\nnot on account of any falsity in it, but simply because\r\nit was unwise and inexpedient to make such remarks.  Barely eighteen months\r\nhave elapsed from the time when I made that prediction\r\nere we find the Union Parliament pass the Natives' Land Act,\r\nwhich creates conditions, if not amounting to extermination, yet designed\r\nto enslave the Natives of this country.  That tyrannical mandate is scattering\r\nmultitudes of Natives from their homes.  Mother earth is to them now\r\nonly a step-dame.  They may enter either into perpetual bondage on the farm,\r\nor spend \"a sunless life in the unwholesome mine\".\r\n\r\nTo-day there is also a revival of persecution in the Free State.\r\nThe old laws of the dark days are being enforced with relentless rigour.\r\nThe sanctity of homes is violated.  Wives are compelled to carry passes.\r\nMothers driven to abandon their offspring of tender years and seek employment.\r\nDaughters are wrenched from parental care and control,\r\nand forced into the service of some white scoundrel.  Husbands are not allowed\r\nto work at their trades for themselves without paying 5s. per month\r\nfor the privilege.  Such is the condition of things in the slave State.\r\nAnd all this is done behind the power of the British flag\r\nwhich floats over that Province, and yet these acts were impossible\r\nwhile the Free State lacked the power to face British public opinion.\r\nMoreover, in the Cape Colony the Free State laws are gradually\r\nbeing introduced.  The Curfew Laws are enforced.  A distinct colour line\r\nis being drawn in every phase of life, more distinctly since General Smuts\r\ndeclared that colour and colour only is to be the dividing line.\r\n\r\nSuch a long list of tyrannical acts of persecutions as I could make out\r\n-- persecutions of the Coloured people as a class as well as individually --\r\ncan point to but one conclusion, and that is that the whites are determined\r\nat all hazards to repress all aspirations of the Coloured people\r\nfor a higher life, to deny all opportunities of betterment,\r\nto keep them politically, civilly and industrially as slaves,\r\nand even to force those who have risen back into a state worse than slavery.\r\nSouth Africa is fast becoming\r\n\r\n    A land of tyrants, and a den of slaves,\r\n    Where wretches seek dishonourable graves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Duty of Europeans\r\n\r\nWhat is the duty of Europeans towards the Coloured races of the country?\r\nTake the oft-repeated assertions of Europeans themselves.\r\nTheir leaders are fond of talking of their responsibilities to us.  They have\r\neverlastingly had, or used to have until quite recently, on their lips\r\nthese nice-sounding phrases about \"our duties and our responsibilities\r\nto our Coloured brothers\".  But are such phrases not hollow and meaningless?\r\nIf Europeans have duties towards the Coloured people, what else is implied\r\nthan the need for humane dealings, and endeavours to ameliorate their lot,\r\nand uplift them in the scale of civilization.  If that is what\r\ntheir duties mean, let us ask how far they have fulfilled them.\r\n\r\nInstead of kindly, humane treatment, we find barbarous cruelty and inhumanity.\r\nInstead of ameliorating our lot they endeavour to accentuate its bitterness.\r\nInstead of aiming at our upliftment they seek to degrade us.\r\nInstead of lending a helping hand to those struggling to improve themselves\r\nthey thrust them back remorselessly and rigorously.\r\nInstead of making it possible for them to enjoy the blessings\r\nof an enlightened Christianity and a noble civilization,\r\nthey refuse them the right to live, unless they are content\r\nto slave for farmers or descend into the bowels of the earth\r\nto delve the gold which enslaves the world, and before whose charms\r\nall freedom flies.  In short, the object of the white man's rule to-day\r\nis not to develop the faculties of the Coloured races so that they may live\r\na full life, but to keep them for ever in a servile position.\r\nThe spirit that underlies this view of governing Coloured races\r\nspread into this Colony with the Union, and is now universal\r\nthroughout South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Coloured people resent this, and one cannot be astonished\r\nat the feeling of violent hostility that has sprung up.\r\nIt is a natural result.  And, in the words of Carlyle, it may be said\r\nthat \"to whatever other griefs the Coloured people labour under,\r\nthis bitterest grief -- injustice -- super-adds itself:\r\nthe unendurable conviction that they are unfairly dealt with,\r\nthat their lot in this world is not founded on right,\r\nnor even on necessity and might, is neither what it should be,\r\nnor what it shall be.\"  The Coloured peoples are sentient beings.\r\nTheir souls smart under the stigma of injustice.  They are nursing\r\na sullen revengeful humour of revolt against the white rule.\r\nThey have lost respect for the white man, and are refusing to give their best\r\nto the country.\r\n\r\nThe duty of Europeans is plain.  Show the Coloured people that the Government\r\nis for the good of all, not for the privileged class.  Prove that\r\nthe first aim is not to keep us as hewers of wood and drawers of water\r\nto men who have the power.  Engage the Coloured races by their affection.\r\nGrant them equal opportunities.  If you do so, then the happy harmonization\r\nof the whole community will be achieved, and you may be sure of receiving\r\nthe grateful return of the affection and respect of the Coloured races.\r\n\r\nThe treatment we might reasonably expect from the dominant race\r\nis just what they themselves would expect were they in our position.\r\nWe have as much right to the land of South Africa as they.\r\nWe have as much right as they to be governed on the same basis of humanity.\r\nIn the language of one of England's greatest statesmen, Europeans themselves\r\nwould have been shut out from all the blessings they enjoy,\r\nof peace, of happiness, and of liberty if there had been any truth\r\nin these principles which some gentlemen have not hesitated to lay down\r\nas applicable to the case of Africa.  \"Had those principles been true,\r\nwe ourselves,\" said William Pitt, \"had languished to this hour\r\nin that miserable state of ignorance, brutality, and degradation,\r\nin which history proves our ancestors to have been immersed.\r\nHad other nations adopted those principles in their conduct towards us;\r\nhad other nations applied to Great Britain the reasoning\r\nwhich some of the Senators of this very Island now apply to Africa,\r\nages might have passed without our emerging from barbarism;\r\nand we, who are enjoying the blessings of British civilization,\r\nof British laws, and British liberty, might at this hour have been\r\nlittle superior either in morals, in knowledge, or refinement,\r\nto the rude inhabitants of the coast of Guinea.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of Pitt in a speech he delivered in 1792\r\nin the course of a debate on the Slave Trade.  His opinions\r\nwere vastly different from those of our South African Premier,\r\nwho only refrains from using the sjambok, so he has told us,\r\non no other ground than that it might also hurt himself,\r\nand who is determined to allow no native representative\r\nin the Union Parliament as long as the Almighty spares him to be overlord.\r\nHe does not look forward as Pitt did to the day when \"We (British)\r\nmight behold the beams of science and philosophy breaking in upon Africa,\r\nwhich, at some happy period, may blaze with full lustre.\"\r\nBut this policy of repression cannot last much longer.\r\nIf a handful of Indians in a matter of conscience can so firmly resist\r\nwhat they consider injustice, what could the Coloured races not do\r\nif they were to adopt this practice of passive resistance?\r\nWe must all admire what these British Indians have shown, and are showing,\r\nin their determination to maintain what they deem to be their rights.\r\nThe inhumanity of the Free State has driven our women to resist the law.\r\nNumbers of them went to jail rather than carry passes.  The Coloured races\r\napplaud the noble actions of those brave daughters of Africa.\r\nI am convinced that if our people as a whole were prepared to suffer likewise\r\nwe could gain redress of our most serious grievances\r\nwhile General Botha is still alive.  Are we to be driven to that course?\r\nEuropeans should ask themselves that question, and ask it promptly.\r\nFor example, if the 200,000 Natives on the mines were,\r\nin the language of the white Labour Party, to \"down\" tools,\r\nand prefer to bask in the sun than to go down the mines;\r\nif the farm labourer at harvesting time refused to work\r\nfor one shilling and sixpence a day, the economic foundation of South Africa\r\nwould suddenly shake and tremble with such violence that\r\nthe beautiful white South Africa superstructure which has been built on it\r\nwould come down with a crash, entailing financial ruin\r\nsuch as the world has never witnessed before.  If Europeans\r\nwish to prevent such a calamity in this country, they must\r\npursue the right course and encourage the Coloured people of South Africa\r\nto improve their position and become more useful citizens\r\nthan they have ever been.  They will themselves participate\r\nin the blessings that spring from our improvement and prosperity,\r\nand they will receive \"ample recompense for their tardy kindness\r\n(if kindness it can be called) in no longer hindering\" our progress.\r\n\r\nWe also should urge Europeans to go back to the path of justice, to retrace\r\ntheir steps along the route they appear to have been travelling of late.\r\nThey can influence the Legislature.  Whatever Parliament does\r\nis done in the name of the white people, and whites should,\r\nif they wish to see South Africa a happy, prosperous and peaceful country,\r\ncheck the Parliament in its mad career.  It is worse than insensate folly\r\nto pursue that path any further.  Many people have revolted at less oppression\r\nthan we have had to suffer.  At present we have no other course\r\nthan to endure in silence the persecution of our tyrants,\r\nand conform to the servitude imposed on us.  We may well exclaim\r\nthat this is a country where\r\n\r\n    The wanton whites new penal statutes draw\r\n    Whites grind the blacks, and white men rule the law.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is not too late to mend.  The estrangement\r\nbetween the two races is not irreconcilable.  Europeans could,\r\nwith advantage to the country, if they would only be men,\r\nshow the Coloured people that the white man's rule is for the good of all,\r\nnot for the privileged class only.  If they grant the Coloured races\r\nequal opportunities, and do not penalize them on account of race or colour,\r\nthey may see a happy realization of the dreams of the wisest statesmen\r\nthat all classes should be contented, and should work together\r\nfor the good of all.\r\n==\r\n\r\nDr. Abdurahman's address provided material for leading articles\r\nin the South African papers during that and the following week,\r\nthe criticisms, with very few exceptions, being more or less hostile.\r\nNot one of them, however, accused him of telling untruths;\r\nbut they vehemently resented the tone of his speech, which they characterized\r\nas inflammatory.  One daily paper showed some inconsistency in the matter.\r\nIt upbraided the doctor for his attack upon oppressive legislation,\r\nand two days later, presumably after second thoughts,\r\ncame out with a leading article urging Europeans to check\r\ntheir oppression of the blacks, and in their own interests\r\ndeal justly by the native and coloured sections of the population.\r\nBy the Natives it was said that under the present circumstances\r\nthe speech could have been better for a little moderation;\r\nbut they nevertheless pronounced it the clearest and most accurate\r\nrepresentation of their condition under the Union Administration\r\nthat was ever uttered on a South African platform.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that Dr. Abdurahman delivered his address\r\nat a time when the operation of the Land Act was raging like a plague\r\nin the Northern Provinces, and its victims included an old man of 119 years,\r\nrespected by his white neighbours, with his nonogenarian wife,\r\nand his sons aged seventy and eighty.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the Native, it is satisfactory to note\r\nthat such sincere white students of the native question\r\nas Dr. J. E. Mackenzie of Kimberley, and Rev. Chas. Phillips of Johannesburg,\r\nwhen asked to dissociate themselves from Dr. Abdurahman's charges\r\nof \"cruelty, inhumanity,\" etc., refused to do so until it could be pointed out\r\nthat he had spoken untruths; that, however, could more easily be done\r\nby a shrug of the shoulders than by adducing substantial facts.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is doubtful if any South African journalist possesses\r\nthe experience of Mr. Vere Stent, the editor of the `Pretoria News'.\r\nMr. Stent as a Kimberley youth spent many years in the de Beers\r\nmining compounds, working with Natives of nearly all African tribes.\r\nHe was war correspondent in Ashanti and other parts of Africa, and also with\r\nthe Republican troops under General Joubert in the Northern Transvaal\r\nin the 'eighties, and saw the Boers (whose primitive artillery\r\ncould not dislodge a native tribe that was impregnably entrenched\r\ninside a cave) closing up the mouth of the cave and sealing up the masonry,\r\nthen leaving the Natives, men, women and children, to smother to death\r\nwith their belongings inside the cave.  Further, Mr. Stent\r\naccompanied Cecil Rhodes to the Mattopo hills, where the late Colossus\r\nwent unarmed to hold with the Matabele chiefs the pourparler\r\nwhich brought about the peace of Southern Rhodesia.  In the siege of Mafeking,\r\nMr. Stent was Reuter's war correspondent, and all things considered,\r\nit must be conceded that he is better qualified to write\r\non a subject of this kind than all the critics of Dr. Abdurahman.\r\n\r\nCommenting on Dr. Abdurahman's address, in the course of a leading article\r\nMr. Stent said:\r\n\r\n==\r\nHere is no paid agitator, but a professional man and a scholar,\r\nwho is addressing the Coloured workers of South Africa\r\nfrom the lowest Aborigine to the Bantu, from the Bantu\r\nto the Coloured tradesman, from the Coloured tradesman\r\nto the professional man, of whom there are a few like himself,\r\na great mass of unenfranchised human beings that suffer\r\nunder disabilities and actual and obvious injustice.\r\n\r\nThis vast proletariat is slowly cohering.  Tribal feuds\r\nare being forgotten.  The anti-colour laws of South Africa,\r\nand particularly of the north -- which makes no difference\r\nbetween the savage Zulu fresh from his kraal and the stately Malay,\r\nbetween the Mashaangan and a man like Dr. Abdurahman himself --\r\nare welding together this vast human mass, in the flux of a single grievance,\r\nand that grievance, the disability put upon colour qua colour by the law.\r\n\r\nWhat if some day, and sooner than we think, that great mass becomes mobile,\r\nlearns to co-operate, and moves irresistibly together?\r\n\r\nWhat, again, which is more likely, if its molecules\r\nrealize the power of their inertia, if they simply decide\r\nquite constitutionally and without violence to do nothing,\r\npending a remedy of their grievances?\r\n\r\nIt will, of course, be said that Dr. Abdurahman is a picturesque extremist;\r\nthat his position is an abnormal one; that he does not speak for\r\nthe Coloured people and the Natives as a whole.  Do not let us be too certain\r\non the last point.\r\n\r\nAs to the first, there runs through the speech, holding it together\r\nand making it difficult to attack, a single plain statement in it --\r\na steel strong thread of truth.\r\n\r\nHe throws quite a new light upon the Voortrekkers when he says: --\r\n\r\n\"The northward march of the Voortrekkers was a gigantic plundering raid.\r\nThey swept like a desolating pestilence through the land,\r\nblasting everything in their path, and pitilessly laughing\r\nat the ravages from which the native races have not yet recovered.\"\r\nBut from the point of view of the native races, the description is a true one.\r\n\r\nTo say of the Natives' Land Act, \"That tyrannical mandate is scattering\r\nmultitudes of Natives from their homes\" is extravagant.  Only a few so far\r\nhave been disturbed, but many must be disturbed for the Natives' Land Act\r\nis tyrannical.  In fact, though couched in the flowing language of an orator,\r\nthe speech on the whole is not an unfair summing up of the grievances\r\nof the coloured people, and there is a very solemn warning in it.\r\nThe European labour agitators may well envy Dr. Abdurahman:\r\nhis logic, his doctrine and his power of invective.  He has so much\r\nto complain of, he asks for so very little.  Just equality of opportunity.\r\nHe does not propose to set up any Trades' Hall government within a government;\r\nhe does not talk about or attempt to incite to riot or revolution;\r\nhe does not speak for a few skilled artisans who are living in comfort,\r\nand sometimes luxury, upon the sweat of the black man's brow;\r\nhe speaks for the dark, submerged 5,000,000 South Africans upon whom light\r\nis very slowly breaking.\r\n==\r\n\r\nIt should also be recorded that long before Dr. Abdurahman\r\nbecame President of the Coloured Organization, white men\r\nhave been delivering speeches, some of them rather indignant,\r\non the treatment of His Majesty's coloured and native subjects\r\nin South Africa.  We will refer to just a few for example:\r\n\r\n==\r\n\"I will leave out of account altogether,\" said His Excellency,\r\n\"the unwise and hard things said by reckless and unthinking white men\r\nabout Natives; I will only ask white men to consider whether they have\r\never calculated the cumulative effect on the Natives of what I may call\r\nthe policy of pin-pricks?  In some places a Native, however personally clean,\r\nor however hard he may have striven to civilize himself,\r\nis not allowed to walk on the pavement of the public streets;\r\nin others he is not allowed to go into a public park or to pay\r\nfor the privilege of watching a game of cricket; in others he is not allowed\r\nto ride on the top of a tram-car, even in specified seats set apart for him;\r\nin others he is not allowed to ride in a railway carriage except in\r\na sort of dog-kennel; in others he is unfeelingly and ungraciously treated\r\nby white officials; in others he may not stir without a pass,\r\nand if, for instance, he comes, as thousands of Natives do,\r\nfrom the farm on which he resides to work in a labour district\r\n-- (an act which is highly beneficial to the State and commendable\r\nin the eyes of all white men) -- he does not meet with facilities,\r\nbut with elaborate impediments.  In the course of his absence from home\r\nhe may have to take out at least eight different passes, for several of which\r\nhe has the additional pleasure of paying, though he would be much happier\r\nwithout them; and it is possible that, in an extreme case,\r\nhe may have to conform to no fewer than twenty different pass regulations.\r\nNow, let a white man put himself in the position of a black man,\r\nand see how he would like it, and let him ask whether\r\nsuch regulations and laws really make his task easier?\"  -- Lord Selborne,\r\nbefore the Congregation of the University of the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nFebruary 27, 1909.\r\n==\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Dewdney W. Drew, M.A., who was member of the Legislative Council\r\nunder the Crown Colony Government in the Orange River Colony, now misnamed\r\nthe Orange \"Free\" State, is one of the leading South African journalists.\r\nIn his pamphlet on the Native Question, about four years ago,\r\nMr. Drew made the following remarks:\r\n\r\n==\r\nMost Europeans adopt towards the Natives the privilege of the aristocrat --\r\nnot always with the manners of an aristocrat.  Many whites expect\r\nas a matter of course obeisance and service from all Natives,\r\nand think it perfectly natural to cuff and correct them when\r\nthey make mistakes.  Any resentment is apt to draw down severe punishment.\r\nIn the law courts the Natives do not get the same justice as the whites.\r\nA Native convicted of an offence gets, in the first place, the punishment\r\nwhich a white man would get and something extra for the colour of his skin --\r\noften lashes.  The bias of white juries in trying Natives\r\ncharged with offences against whites is such as to have brought\r\nthe jury system into disrepute, and become a chief argument among lawyers\r\nfor its entire abolition.  The Natives suffer various restrictions\r\non their liberty; they may not use the side-walks, nor visit a friend's house\r\nafter a certain hour at night, nor move abroad, or even exist\r\nanywhere in this \"white man's country\" without a pass.\r\nAll the police, if not all Europeans, have the right\r\nto arrest and search them, and the exercise of this right is made sometimes\r\na means of shamefully molesting their women.  In one Colony\r\nthe Natives are not allowed to own land, and in another they can only do so\r\nunder virtually prohibitive conditions.  If the tenant families\r\nresiding upon a farm grow beyond a certain limited number -- three or five --\r\nthe surplus are liable to be driven off by the police.  As a rule\r\nonly the worse-paid forms of work are permitted to the Natives,\r\nand even these are grudged them.  A legislator rises in one Colony to move\r\nthat all native messengers and other native servants in the Government offices\r\nbe immediately discharged and replaced by poor whites.  In another Colony,\r\nthe papers and the public chorus with joy to hear that the C.S.A.R.\r\nhas been able to reduce its native staff, and hopes ultimately\r\nto get rid of them all.  There are municipalities in which Natives,\r\nif they drive a cab, have to pay a higher licence than a white man,\r\nand in which they are not permitted to make bricks unless they do so\r\nfor a white employer.  In these municipalities they are not allowed\r\nto educate their children above the age of sixteen, nor may they keep\r\ntheir daughters at home under their own protection after that age,\r\nexcept the girls find positions in service, in which case they may sleep\r\nunder the roof of their parents if the distance is not too great.\r\nAnd, of course, the Natives pay relatively a higher taxation than the whites.\r\nArticles which they use, but which are little bought by the whites,\r\nare marked for special customs duties.  For instance,\r\nthe white farmers' machinery is duty free, but in several Colonies\r\nthe native hoes pay an ad valorem tax of 25 per cent.\r\nSo of shawls; the Customs officer is content to take 12 1/2 per cent\r\non the kind used by Europeans, but when he comes to the native shawl,\r\nthe duty is again 25 per cent.  In addition to these stiff indirect taxes,\r\nthe Native pays direct taxes amounting to one-sixth part of their average\r\nannual wage.  Not only they, but even the most respectable coloured people,\r\nare in some places not allowed to ride in trams or walk in the parks,\r\nor attend public sports, or evening concerts, or even follow a deceased white,\r\nthough he should be their own father, to his last resting place\r\nin the European cemetery.  As to the laws, they realize,\r\nin all the Colonies but one, Wellington's great ideal for the people,\r\nby having nothing to do with them except obey them.  In addition\r\nto this treatment, varying from mere pin-pricks to oppression,\r\nthey are mostly referred to in the Press, in public speeches,\r\nand private conversation, with words of opprobrium and contempt\r\nas \"niggers\" and \"black brutes\".  The occasional outbreaks of a few,\r\nusually maddened with drink which Europeans have sold to them,\r\nare put to the discredit of the whole race.  Those who,\r\nwhen they hear of a case of rape, talk about the black peril,\r\nforget apparently that it is largely the result of a bad environment.\r\nIn their own country the Natives are by no means lacking in respect\r\nto white womanhood.  A European lady travelling in Basutoland without escort\r\nwould probably be safer there than in England under the like condition.\r\nThe Hon. H. Burton, Attorney-General of the Cape Colony,\r\nreports, after visiting the Transkei, that in that great reserve,\r\nwhere ten thousand Europeans are surrounded by a million Natives,\r\nthe molestation of white women is a thing unheard of. . . .\r\nObviously the treatment which the Natives get is not on the whole\r\nsuch as he can be expected to like, and the drift of things\r\nappears to be towards greater harshness, especially towards\r\nseverer pass laws and the stricter denial of property rights.\r\nIn one of our Parliaments a Commission has just reported\r\nin favour of breaking up the reserves and bringing the Natives\r\nunder a system resembling slavery.\r\n==\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI      The Natives' Land Act in Cape Colony\r\n\r\n  It must not be lost sight of that all land held by Europeans\r\n    in Africa has been acquired by conquest or diplomacy,\r\n    and that the aboriginal Natives have been ousted by the white man:\r\n    that being so, I cannot see any reason why the Native\r\n    should not be allowed to buy back what he has lost; in my opinion\r\n    he should be encouraged to do so. . . .\r\n  He is a better citizen than the thriftless European who lives\r\n    from hand to mouth and makes no effort to better his circumstances. . . .\r\n  Legislation should be carefully watched lest endeavours be made\r\n    to deprive deserving Natives of the privilege of acquiring title to land.\r\n    In the Transvaal strong efforts are being made to restrict\r\n    the acquisition of land by Natives; but I can see\r\n    neither justice nor reason in such a measure.  If the Native\r\n    by his education, honesty, thrift and industry has got the means\r\n    to buy land, even in the Transvaal, why should he not be allowed\r\n    to do so? . . .\r\n  The Natives are already pretty tightly \"squeezed\" in the matter of land\r\n    in South Africa, and it is time this \"squeezing\" process came to an end.\r\n    They must have somewhere to live.  What would we do in this country\r\n    without them?\r\n                                       Mr. J. Hemming, a Cape Magistrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the month of October, 1913, the fell work of the iniquitous\r\nprovisions of the Natives' Land Act was done so remorselessly\r\nthat the British blood of certain editors of Natal dailies\r\nrose superior to their Colonial prejudices and they lashed out against\r\nsuch wicked and wholesale injustice on the part of the legislation\r\nagainst the peaceful native population.  It has already been pointed out\r\nthat when the Secretary for Native Affairs started to tour the districts,\r\nto teach Magistrates how to enforce the new Plague Act,\r\nsome people thought that the tour was part of a scheme to alleviate\r\nthe distress that followed the enforcement of the Natives' Land Act,\r\nbut the Natives and those of their sympathizers who followed\r\nMr. Dower's itinerary very soon discovered that the authorities\r\nwere waging a war of extermination against the blacks;\r\nand that they were bent upon reducing the independent black peasantry\r\nto a state of thraldom.  Commenting on Mr. Dower's visit to the \"Free\" State,\r\nthe `Natal Advertiser' of October 4, 1913, said: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nThe explanation of the Natives' Land Act, given to the Barolongs of Thaba Nchu\r\nby Mr. Dower, is so illuminative of the wretched unsatisfactoriness of the Act\r\nthat the occasion certainly merits notice.  It would be difficult\r\nto conceive a more thoroughgoing and drastic condemnation of the Act\r\nthan this attempt at faint praise of it, delivered by\r\nthe Secretary of the Native Affairs Department.  All he can say\r\nto these unfortunate Natives is, that it would be better\r\nto engage as labourers or sell up than to trek from pillar to post,\r\ntill all their cattle had died.  As to saying that farmers\r\nalways had power to evict, the interrupting Native hit the nail on the head\r\nby his ejaculation:  \"But we could go elsewhere.\"\r\n==\r\n\r\nOn October 5, the daily papers published the following telegram\r\nfrom Johannesburg:\r\n\r\n==\r\nAs the result of the passing of the Natives' Land Act, groups of Natives\r\nare to be seen in the different Provinces seeking for new land.\r\nThey have crossed over from the Free State into Natal, from Natal\r\ninto the Transvaal, and from the Transvaal into British Bechuanaland. . . .\r\n\r\nYesterday a native arrived in Johannesburg from the Umvoti district, Natal,\r\nand reported that a chief, together with his tribe, had been evicted\r\nfrom a farm in the Greytown district, Natal, and that feeling in the matter\r\nhad become acute.\r\n\r\nIn the Western Transvaal hundreds of natives are crossing over\r\ninto the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and in the Eastern Transvaal\r\nthey are concentrating on three farms in the Wakkerstroom district\r\nthat have been bought by a native land company.\r\n\r\nAt present the attention of those working for the repeal of the law\r\nis being concentrated on the collection of funds for the purpose of sending\r\na deputation to England.  They hope to arouse public opinion there\r\nby lectures and other means.\r\n==\r\n\r\nThe `Natal Mercury' said:\r\n\r\n==\r\nWe pointed out at the time that the Act was passed that it was being\r\nrushed through the House without any proper inquiry and without much regard\r\nfor native opinion or native feeling in a matter that affected\r\ntheir most vital interests.  It was replied that the administration of the Act\r\nwould be carried out on sympathetic lines, and that Mr. Sauer\r\nwould make himself personally responsible for the administration\r\nbeing carried out in a manner which would inflict the least possible hardships\r\non the Natives affected.  The industrial crisis was followed\r\nby the untimely end of Mr. Sauer which made his tour impossible,\r\nand the Act now seems to be put in force on the most approved red-tape lines,\r\nwith the result that the Natives are in a state of great alarm and agitation.\r\nAt the recent Missionary Conference at Maritzburg on July 8,\r\nthe question was the subject of considerable discussion,\r\nand a series of resolutions were passed.\r\n\r\nWhat is happening is that in many places the Natives are being driven off land\r\nwhere they have been from time immemorial, so to speak.  They consider the Act\r\nas an attempt to drive them into slavery, and numbers of them are being placed\r\nin the position of having no place to which to go.\r\n==\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that all English colonial journalists\r\nregretted the operation of this atrocious law.  The `Cape Times',\r\nfor instance, vied with the Hertzog press in congratulating the minister\r\non having successfully passed it, and in belittling the hardships\r\nof the victims of the Act.  One English farmer wrote to the `Farmer's Weekly'\r\nthat the evictions were effective, but at the same time he regretted that\r\n\"as long as the Native kept to the public road he still had a resting place\r\nfor the hollow of his foot.\"  The Native had been successfully legislated\r\noff the land, and apparently this farmer wanted him to be legislated\r\noff the roads as well.  Another English journalist wrote to the `Sunday Post'\r\nthat the hardships are exaggerated, as he had himself seen\r\nonly twelve families evicted in one day and on one farm.\r\nThe question which this statement suggests is:  How many families\r\nmust be ejected from one farm in one day to constitute a hardship;\r\nand whether this journalist would view with the same coolness\r\na law which forcibly turned twelve white families off a farm,\r\nagainst the wishes of themselves and the landowner?\r\n\r\nAgain, it cannot be said that South African politicians as a whole\r\nwere indifferent to the suffering of the luckless victims of the Land Act,\r\nbut they eased their consciences with the palliative thought\r\nthat the sufferers were not so many.  However this blissful\r\nthough erroneous self-satisfaction was nailed to the counter\r\nby the Rev. A. Burnet of Transvaal, when he said:  \"I have yet to learn\r\nthat a harsh law becomes less harsh, and an act of injustice less unjust,\r\nbecause only a few people are affected by it.\"\r\n\r\nThe section of the law debarring Natives from hiring land\r\nis particularly harsh.  It has been explained that its major portion\r\nis intended to reduce the Natives to serfs; but it should also\r\nbe noted that the portion of the Act that is against Natives\r\nacquiring any interest whatsoever in land aims directly\r\nat dispossessing the Natives of their live stock.  Section 5\r\nprovides for a fine of 100 Pounds, or six months' imprisonment,\r\nto a farmer convicted of accommodating a Native on his farm.\r\nAnd if after the fine is paid, the Native leaves the stock on the farm,\r\nfor a number of days, while he goes to search for another place,\r\nthere will be a fine of 5 Pounds per diem for each day the cattle remain\r\non the farm.  The cattle should be consigned to the road\r\nimmediately the order is given for the ejection, and they should remain\r\nwithout food till their owner sells them, or finds employment under a farmer\r\nas a wage-earner.  Thus it would seem that the aim of Section 5\r\nis not only to prohibit native occupation of land, but, in addition to it,\r\nmakes it impossible for him to be a cattle owner.\r\n\r\nWhen this harsh provision of the law was brought to the notice\r\nof Cape politicians, they shrugged their shoulders and remarked\r\nthat they were happy that things in the Cape were not so bad.\r\nBut this is no excuse at all, for in accordance with the wording of the Act,\r\nas substantiated by its results upon the Cape Natives,\r\nthe condition of these Natives is worse in many instances\r\nthan it is among the Natives of Natal, or of the Transvaal.\r\nIn these two Provinces a European who has no intention of evicting his Natives\r\nmay retain their services under certain restrictions (see Sub-sect. 6 (c));\r\nbut in the Cape and the Orange \"Free\" State, the Native,\r\naccording to Section 1, may retain no interest whatever in land,\r\nincluding the \"ploughing on shares\".\r\n\r\nWell-to-do Natives, from Grahamstown to the Transkeian boundaries,\r\nmainly derived their wealth from this form of occupation.  It enabled them\r\nto lead respectable lives and to educate their children.  The new prohibitions\r\ntended to drive these Natives back into overcrowded locations,\r\nwith the logical result that sundry acute domestic problems,\r\nsuch as disordered sanitation caused by the smallness of the location,\r\nloss of numerous heads of cattle owing to the too limited pasturage\r\nin the locations, are likely to arise.  These herds of cattle\r\nhave been the Natives' only capital, or the Natives' \"bank\",\r\nas they truthfully call them, so that, deprived of this occupation,\r\nthe down-grade of a people, under an unsympathetic quasi-Republican Government\r\nlike the present Union Administration, must be very rapid.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the traditional liberal policy of Cape Colony\r\nhas broken down through this law can no longer be disputed:\r\nindeed, the only comfort that had been held out to the Natives\r\nwas that Mr. Sauer would make the Natives' Land Act a dead letter.\r\nThis statesman having since died, we were anxious to see how the Cape Natives\r\nwere faring under the Act, so we left Kimberley on November 1, 1913,\r\non a tour of observation in the eastern districts of the Cape Province.\r\nOur programme included visits to two alleged defenders of the Act,\r\nin the persons of Rev. James Henderson of Lovedale, and Mr. Tengo Jabavu\r\nof King Williamstown, editor of the Xosa Ministerial newspaper.\r\nOur object in visiting these gentlemen was to acquaint ourselves\r\nwith their point of view, and if possible to arrive at an agreement with them.\r\n\r\nWe reached Alice in the forenoon and walked through the town\r\nto the famous Native Institution.  We made our first acquaintance\r\nwith Lovedale, and we hardly remember having seen so many native boys\r\nhoused in any one place before.  But it pained us to think what must be\r\nthe future lot of this great gathering of young fellows, who are now\r\ndebarred by law from rights of ownership of the soil of South Africa,\r\ntheir own homeland.\r\n\r\nDuring our three hours' stay at Lovedale we had an interview\r\nwith Mr. Henderson, the Principal, about things in general,\r\nand the Native College Scheme in particular, and lastly, but not least,\r\nabout the Native Land Act.  Unfortunately we could learn nothing\r\nfrom the eminent educator, for we found that his conclusions\r\nwere based on second-hand information.  He had never met\r\nany member of the Government, or their representatives,\r\nin fact it was news to the Principal that in going to Lovedale, that morning,\r\nwe had met men on their way from the Magistrate's office in Alice,\r\nnot far away, who had been definitely warned by the Magistrate\r\nagainst re-ploughing their old lands on the farms.  Of course Mr. Henderson\r\nwas moved with sympathy for a people so ruthlessly treated by a Government\r\nthey had loyally served.  And it would seem that the Principal of Lovedale\r\nhad since made independent inquiries, for we have read in the Lovedale paper\r\nother evidence of the operation of this drastic law that had not come under\r\nour own observation.  Thus in supporting the case of the Native Deputation\r\nin the Imperial Parliament on July 28, 1914, Sir Albert Spicer\r\neffectively read passages from the `Christian Express', the organ of Lovedale.\r\n\r\nOne of the instructors at Lovedale very kindly lent us a horse,\r\nand Mr. Moikangoa accompanied us to an all-night meeting at Sheshegu,\r\na famous political \"rendezvous\" which has acquired this distinction\r\nbecause it is the centre of numerous little locations,\r\nwithin easy reach of four surrounding Magistracies.  At the all-night meeting\r\nat Sheshegu there were chiefs, headmen, and other Natives from the Peddie,\r\nFort Beaufort and Alice districts.  There were a number of school teachers\r\nalso from these districts, and two or three native storekeepers.\r\nThe disclosures made by the several speakers concerning\r\nthe operation of the Land Act among the Natives made one's heart bleed.\r\nThe chieftain Kapok Mgijima, who entertained many of the visitors\r\nto the meeting, had his own peculiar experience under the Act.\r\nNot only had he been debarred from re-ploughing his own lands,\r\nbut he had also been ordered to move his oxen from a farm owned by a European,\r\nwhere for fourteen years he had grazed his oxen.  Another Native,\r\nwho had been ploughing in the direction of King Williamstown,\r\nwas warned by the authorities not to resume his ploughing in 1913.\r\nHe could only do so as a servant in the employ of a white landowner.\r\nHe was further warned that if he connived with the white man to cheat the law,\r\nby representing themselves as master and servant, they would, when found out\r\nto be still carrying on their old relation of landlord and tenant,\r\nbe dealt with very severely.\r\n\r\nThe landlord was furious.  \"Why,\" he asked, \"did you tell them\r\nof your intention?  You should have done your business quietly;\r\nnow that you have apprised them they will watch us, you fool.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said the Native, \"owing to the existence of East Coast fever\r\nin Transkei, no animals can be taken from one plantation to another\r\nwithout a magisterial permit disclosing the object of the removal.\r\nI had to tell what I wanted to come here for.  I was asked\r\nat the Magistrate's office if I did not know the law.\r\nI said that I was aware of such a new law, which had created\r\na lot of disturbance in the Northern Provinces, but I had never heard\r\nthat it was applicable to the Cape.  To this the Magistrate's clerk replied\r\nthat it was not a Provincial law, it was a law of the Union,\r\nof which the Cape formed part.  There were certain exemptions,\r\nthe clerk added, but they did not exempt the Cape Natives from\r\nthe prohibition of ploughing on white men's farms and grazing their cattle\r\non those farms.\"\r\n\r\nOther speakers narrated their experiences under the Act, and these experiences\r\nshowed that the Plague Act was raging with particular fury\r\nin the old Cape Districts of Fort Beaufort, Grahamstown, King Williamstown,\r\nand East London.  At this meeting it was resolved to support a movement\r\nto send an appeal to His Majesty the King, against this law.\r\n\r\nOur visit to these places took place just after the glorious showers\r\nof the early summer.  On the wider tracts of land owned by Europeans\r\nthe grass looked invitingly green.  The maiden soil,\r\nlooking beautiful and soft after the soaking rains, cried silently\r\nfor cultivation.  The people who had hitherto depended on such cultivation\r\nfor their subsistence were now prohibited by reason of their colour\r\nfrom earning their usual livelihood, as directed by Almighty God,\r\n\"In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread.\"\r\n\r\nThis prohibition seems particularly contemptible when it is remembered\r\nthat the majority of the Natives of these locations are Fingoes,\r\nand that their fathers in the early days joined the British\r\nin fighting most of the Kafir wars, side by side with British troops.\r\nThey shared in all the massacres and devastating raids\r\ncommitted upon the British settlers by unfriendly native tribes.\r\nAs a mark of recognition of their loyalty to the Government,\r\nand of their co-operation with the British forces in the field of battle,\r\nthis country was given, in the name of Her late Majesty Victoria,\r\nto their chiefs by a British Governor.  But in spite of this treaty,\r\nthe people have been gradually dispossessed of the land during the past\r\nthree-quarters of a century.  Hence the occupation, now crystallized\r\ninto ownership, passed bit by bit into white hands.  Hitherto the right\r\nto live on, and to cultivate, lands which thus formerly belonged to them\r\nwas never challenged, but all that is now changed.  Naturally the ingratitude\r\nmeted out to these people by the authorities in return for services\r\nconsistently rendered by three successive generations of them will be a blow,\r\nnot only to the economic independence of a loyal and patriotic people,\r\nbut to the belief in British sense of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII     The Passing of Cape Ideals\r\n\r\n  Naboth was right to hold on to his home.  There were garnered memories\r\n    that all the wealth of Ahab could not buy.\r\n                                       Ward Beecher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the great meeting place -- Sheshegu -- we went through\r\nthe Alice district.  In this district we met several men\r\nwho would get no crops -- their annual income -- the next year,\r\nas the law had placed an embargo on their ordinary avocation.\r\nKing Williamstown was also visited, and there at a meeting\r\nheld in the Baptist Church, which was kindly lent for the purpose\r\nby the Rev. Mr. Pierce, it was unanimously resolved to appeal\r\nto His Majesty the King against the Natives' Land Act.\r\nMr. W. Sebe presided over this meeting of representative Natives,\r\nand Mr. Bassie translated the Act.\r\n\r\nAt Queenstown a similar resolution was passed by practically\r\nthe whole meeting.  Beyond answering questions at each of these meetings,\r\nthe writer said little else besides reading the Act, which told its own tale.\r\nMany Natives who had never seen a copy of the Act before,\r\nbut who had heard its praises sung by interested parties and had believed\r\nthe false teachers, attended the meetings to oppose any undue interference\r\nwith \"the law\".  But these men were appalled when the law was read to them,\r\nsentence by sentence, and translated by their own teachers\r\nin their own tongue.  Then a discussion would follow, invariably ending\r\nwith the query:  \"Can a Parliament capable of passing such a law\r\nstill be trusted by the community concerned?\"\r\n\r\nThe Queenstown meeting, which was held in the Native Baptist School\r\nkindly lent by Messrs. Damane and Koti, was more interesting than the others\r\nbecause it is the only one of the many native meetings we attended\r\nwhere there was any dissent.  There were four dissentients\r\nat Queenstown, and we take this opportunity of congratulating\r\nall genuine enemies of native welfare on the fact that they had\r\nfour staunch protagonists of colour, who showed more manliness\r\nthan Mr. Tengo-Jabavu because they attended the meeting.\r\nStill, if the courage of these opponents was admirable,\r\nwe confess we did not like the gross callousness, and what seemed to us\r\nan indecent disregard of native suffering that was manifest in their conduct:\r\nwhen the story of the hardships of unfortunate victims of the Land Act\r\nwas narrated they laughed, and repeated the newspaper excuse\r\nthat the evictions were not directly due to the Act.\r\n\r\nWe agree with them that evictions have always taken place,\r\nsince the first human couple was sent out of the Garden of Eden, yet they\r\nmust admit that until the Union Parliament passed the Natives' Land Act\r\nthere never was a law saying to the native population of South Africa,\r\n\"You must not settle anywhere, under a penalty of 100 Pounds,\r\nunless you are a servant.\"  These unsympathetic Natives made no effort\r\nto defend the Act itself, but attempted to bluff the meeting\r\nwith the supposed danger of \"reprisals by spiteful Boers, who, they said,\r\nwill be more vindictive if Natives dared to appeal to the King,\r\nover the heads of the Boer Government.\"  But the meeting would not be bluffed.\r\nOne speaker especially remarked that the Act embodied\r\nthe very worst form of vindictiveness, and the sooner the whole world\r\nunderstood the Union Parliament's attitude towards the blacks\r\nthe better it would be.  The meeting agreed that no slavery could be worse\r\nthan to be outlawed in your own homes, and the motion was carried\r\nagainst the said four dissentients.\r\n\r\nWe interviewed a number of the Natives passing through Queenstown,\r\nand the result showed that many and varied were the vicissitudes\r\nof the Natives in the eastern districts of the Cape Province.\r\n\r\nFrom Queenstown we touched some of the north-eastern districts\r\nof the Cape Province.  In one of these districts a fairly prosperous Native\r\nwas farming as a tenant on a farm.  By sheer industry\r\nhe had earned and enjoyed the respect of all who knew him.\r\nHis landlord, a white man, was particularly proud of him.\r\nThis Native went into town one morning and as he passed the Magistrate's Court\r\non his way to the stores, a messenger hailed him inside.\r\nHaving entered the office, the Assistant Magistrate served him with a notice\r\nto leave his hired farm, on which he had been a tenant since his youth,\r\nand which was as much a home to him as to the proprietor.\r\nThe landlord, on hearing of this, naturally resented this usurpation\r\non the part of the authorities, who, he said, had unduly interfered\r\nwith his private affairs.  Next day the Baas drove into the town to interview\r\nthe Magistrate, and to remonstrate with him on what he thought to be\r\nthe unauthorized interference of the Assistant Magistrate.\r\n\r\nHe and the Magistrate read and re-read the Natives' Land Act,\r\nand both came to the conclusion that it was a law that was as complicated\r\nas it was unnecessary; but the Magistrate, being a representative of the law,\r\ndecided that, rightly or wrongly, it must be obeyed.\r\n\r\nThis visit of the Baas to the Magistrate had made our native friend hopeful\r\nthat it would result in averting the calamity that threatened\r\nhim and his family, but, to his utter dismay, the landlord on returning soon\r\nundeceived him and gave his own opinion of \"the most peculiar and wicked law\"\r\nthat he had ever heard of.  Although Dutchmen had known and had heard of\r\nsome strange laws, yet this Dutchman was so full of indignation\r\nat the strangeness of this law that his description of it\r\nwas made up of largely untranslatable Dutch adjectives.  These adjectives,\r\nhowever, could not relieve the suffering of his native tenant\r\nfrom the wound inflicted by the law in his sudden expulsion from his home.\r\nIt seems clear that no South African Native, on leaving a Dutch farm,\r\nhad ever received a more respectable send-off than our friend did\r\non leaving his farm in compliance with the Natives' Land Act.\r\nThe white landlord accompanied him right up to the boundary of the farm\r\nwhich for seventeen years had been his home, and which he was so cruelly\r\nforced to leave.  For the first time in his life, as the Dutchman said,\r\nhe shook hands with a Kafir.  And, as he did so, he called down\r\nthe direst curses upon the persons responsible for the impasse --\r\ncurses, by the way, which seem to be liberally answered.\r\n\r\nIt would, perhaps, be interesting to add what has happened since.\r\nOur native friend took his family to the town, because the Act\r\nis not enforceable in municipal areas.  Leaving his family there,\r\nhe started roaming about the districts, looking for a place\r\nwhere he could graze his cattle.  In the course of the wandering\r\nhis stock thinned down, owing to death from starvation and other causes.\r\nAt home his old master found he could not get on without him,\r\nso learning of the whereabouts of the Native and also of his sad plight,\r\nthe master sent out to him and advised him to return home,\r\ngraze his stock there, and \"hang the legal consequences.\"\r\nMay they never be found out.\r\n\r\nIt has now amounted to this that white men who wish to deal humanely\r\nwith their native friends must resort to clandestine methods, to enable\r\na Native and his stock to drink the fresh water and breathe the pure air\r\nin the wide tracts of South Africa, for by law Natives have now less rights\r\nthan the snakes and scorpions abounding in that country.\r\nCan a law be justified which forces the people to live\r\nonly by means of chicanery; and which, in order to progress, compels one\r\nto cheat the law officers of the Crown?  This case is but one of many\r\nthat came under our own observation, and there may be many more\r\nof which we know nothing.\r\n\r\nThe `Cape Times', the leading Bothaite daily newspaper of the Cape,\r\nhas defended every action of the Union, including the dismissal\r\nof English Civil servants.  It justifies this last act\r\nby alleging that the dismissed officials did not know Dutch.\r\nConsequently it could not be expected that this journal\r\ncould have any qualms about a law enacted specifically to repress black men.\r\nIt supported every harsh clause of the Natives' Land Bill,\r\nincluding Clause 1.  However, when the native deputation to England\r\ngave proofs of the ravages of the \"plague law\" in Cape Colony,\r\nthe `Cape Times', instead of defending its pet law, said:\r\n\"The complaint to which they give precedence is particularly instructive,\"\r\nand so, quoting from the deputation's appeal which says:  \"In the Cape Colony,\r\nwhere we are repeatedly told that the Act is not in force,\r\nthe Magistrates of East London, King Williamstown and Alice\r\nprohibited native tenants from reploughing their old hired lands last October,\r\nand also ordered them to remove their stock from grazing farms,\"\r\nthis ministerial daily adds:  \"It is unnecessary to consider\r\nthe justice or otherwise of this complaint for it is perfectly clear\r\nthat if a Magistrate oversteps the bounds of the law, it is a matter\r\nto be dealt with by the Union Government.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this is an insinuation that the Magistrates\r\nwho administer the Land Act at the Cape are exceeding their authority\r\nand should be \"dealt with by the Union Government\".  Now, what are the facts?\r\nIt is well known that all Magistrates, including those at the Cape, are paid\r\nto administer every legislative instrument, whether sensible or absurd,\r\npassed by the partly literate Parliament of the Union of South Africa.\r\nHence, these Magistrates, in ordering Natives off their farms,\r\nand turning native cattle off the grazing areas, are only carrying out\r\nSection 1 of the Natives' Land Act.  One Cape Magistrate who ruled\r\nthat to plough on a farm was no breach of the law, WAS \"dealt with\r\nby the Union Government\", for a peremptory order came from Pretoria\r\ndeclaring such a decision to be illegal.\r\n\r\nTherefore, so far from the Cape Magistrate \"overstepping\r\nthe bounds of the law\" in expelling Natives from the farms and native cattle\r\nfrom their pastures, these Magistrates could legally have done worse,\r\ninasmuch as they could, under Section 5, have sent these Natives to prison\r\nfor contravening Section 1.  In justification, then,\r\nof its own and of its party's share in this legislative achievement,\r\nthe `Cape Times' should have sought a more worthy excuse than thus attempting\r\nto make scapegoats of a band of fair-minded men who presumably,\r\nprior to the Union, never thought it would be part of their duty\r\nto administer from the Cape bench an Act which inflicted such gross cruelty.\r\n\r\nWho, in the days of the Murrays, Mr. F. Y. St. Leger, and subsequently\r\nof Mr. F. E. Garrett, could have thought that the `Cape Times'\r\nwould in this manner have destroyed its great traditions,\r\nbuilt up during the nineteenth century, by sanctioning a law\r\nunder which Cape Magistrates would be forced to render homeless\r\nthe Natives of the Cape in their own Cape of Good Hope?  The one Colony\r\nwhose administration, under its wise statesmen of the Victorian era,\r\ncreated for it that tremendous prestige that was felt\r\nthroughout the dark continent, and that rested largely\r\nupon the fact that among its citizens, before its incorporation\r\nwith the northern states, it knew no distinction of colour,\r\nfor all were free to qualify for the exercise of electoral rights.\r\nThe old Cape Colony of our boyhood days, whose administration,\r\ndespite occasional lapses, managed during a hundred years\r\nto steer clear of the familiar massacres and bloodshed of punitive expeditions\r\nagainst primitive tribes, massacres and bloodshed so common\r\nin other parts of the same continent; the old Cape Colony whose\r\npeaceful methods of civilization acted as an incentive to the Bechuana tribes\r\nto draw the sword and resist every attempt at annexation by Europeans\r\nother than the British:  a resistance so determined that it thwarted\r\nthe efforts to link German South West Africa with the Transvaal Republic,\r\nand so kept open the trade route to Rhodesia for the British.\r\nAll this done without any effort on the part of the British themselves,\r\nand done by the Natives out of regard for Cape Colony ideals.\r\nBut alas! these Natives are now debarred from tilling the soil of the Cape,\r\nexcept as Republican serfs.  What would Sir George Grey, or Bishop Gray,\r\nor Saul Solomon, say of this?  What would these Empire builders say if they\r\ncame back here and found that the hills and valleys of their old Cape Colony\r\nhave ceased to be a home to many of their million brawny blacks,\r\nwhose muscles helped the conqueror to secure his present hold of the country?\r\nWhat would these champions of justice say if they saw how,\r\nwith her entrance into the Union, Cape Colony had bartered\r\nher shining ideals for the sombre history of the northern states,\r\na history defiled with innocent blood, and a territory\r\nsoaked with native tears and scandalized by burying Natives alive;\r\nand that with one stroke of the pen the so-called federation\r\nhas demolished the Rhodes's formula of \"equal rights for all civilized men,\r\nirrespective of colour\"?  How are the mighty fallen!\r\n\r\nBut while we sing the funeral dirge of Cape ideals, the Republicans\r\nsing songs of gladness.  Thus, when Mr. Sauer, a noted disciple\r\nof the late Mr. Saul Solomon, died, the `Bloemfontein Friend',\r\nthe leading Ministerial daily of the \"Free\" State, said:\r\n\r\n==\r\nHe stood uncompromisingly for Rhodes's ideal of complete equality,\r\nand it was an open secret that Mr. Sauer, who piloted the Natives' Land Act\r\nthrough Parliament last session, would, had circumstances been different,\r\nhave been its strongest opponent.  It was the irony of fate that made him\r\nMinister of Native Affairs when a law had to be passed which appeared to be\r\nin entire conflict with his cherished lifelong convictions.\r\nThe Act he passed embodied the hated northern principles which\r\nhe had consistently opposed during the whole of his political career, and,\r\nas in the case of the Act of Union, it was only Mr. Sauer's influence that\r\nallayed the feelings of the intransigent section of the native population.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauer was a convinced disciple of the teachings of Saul Solomon,\r\nwho founded and preached the gospel of the Cape native policy.\r\nIn our view that was a mistaken policy.  Its principal modern exponent has now\r\nbeen taken away, and if God, and not man, shapes the destinies of nations,\r\nwe may be pardoned the belief that Mr. Sauer's death at this juncture\r\nmeans something more than the mere passing from the finite into the infinite\r\nof one human being.\r\n==\r\n\r\nIf this is a brutal utterance, it is at any rate more frank,\r\nand therefore more manly, than the vacillating policy of the `Cape Times',\r\nthe Ministerial organ of the Cape Colony.  It is said that \"politics\r\nmake strange bed-fellows\", but not even the shrewdest of our political seers\r\ncould have predicted that in 1913 the `Cape Times' would be found\r\nin the same camp as its Republican contemporaries which sing glees\r\nover the demolished structure of Cape traditions, and over\r\nthe passing away of Victorian statesmen and the principles they stood for --\r\nVictorian principles, which the `Cape Times' of other days helped to build up\r\nin another political camp!  How are the mighty fallen!\r\n\r\n    Dear lovely bowers of innocence and ease,\r\n    Seats of my youth when every sport could please,\r\n    How often have I loitered o'er thy green,\r\n    Where humble happiness endeared each scene!\r\n\r\n    How often have I paused on every charm:\r\n    The shelter'd cot, the cultivated farm,\r\n    The never failing brook, the busy mill,\r\n    The decent church that topt the neighbouring hill,\r\n\r\n    The hawthorn bush with seats beneath the shade\r\n    For talking age and whisp'ring lovers made!\r\n    How often have I blest the coming day,\r\n    When toil remitting lent its turn to play!\r\n\r\n    And all the village train, from labour free,\r\n    Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree;\r\n    With bashful virgins' sidelong looks of love,\r\n    The matron's glance that would these looks reprove.\r\n\r\n    These were thy charms, sweet Province, sports like these,\r\n    With sweet succession, taught e'en toil to please;\r\n    These round thy bowers their cheerful influence shed,\r\n    These were thy charms -- but all these charms are fled.\r\n\r\n    Sweet smiling village, loveliest of the lawn,\r\n    Thy sports are fled and all thy charms withdrawn;\r\n    Amidst thy bowers the tyrant's hand is seen\r\n    And desolation saddens all thy green:\r\n\r\n    And trembling, shrinking from the spoiler's hand,\r\n    Far, far away, thy children leave the land.\r\n    Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,\r\n    Where wealth accumulates and men decay.\r\n\r\nThe Cape Native can thoroughly endorse these sentiments of Oliver Goldsmith,\r\nwhich, however, compared with his own present lot, are mild in the extreme;\r\nfor it could not have been amid scenes of this description,\r\nand with an outlook half as bad as ours, that the same author further sings:\r\n\r\n    A time there was e'er England's grief began,\r\n    When every rood of ground maintain'd its man;\r\n    But times are alter'd:  Trade's unfeeling train\r\n    Usurp the land and dispossess the swain.\r\n\r\n    Those gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom,\r\n    Those calm desires that ask'd but little room,\r\n    Those graceful sports that grac'd the peaceful scene,\r\n    Liv'd in each look and brighten'd all the green,\r\n    These far departing seek a kinder shore,\r\n    And rural mirth and manners are no more.\r\n\r\n    In all my wand'rings round this world of care,\r\n    In all my griefs -- and God has giv'n my share --\r\n    I still had hopes my latest hours to crown,\r\n    Amidst these humble bowers to lay me down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII    Mr. Tengo-Jabavu, the Pioneer Native Pressman\r\n\r\n  Egotists cannot converse; they talk to themselves only.\r\n                                       Alcott.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is issued in King Williamstown (Cape) `Imvo', the second oldest\r\nnewspaper published in any one of the South African native languages.\r\nThis paper formerly had a kind of monopoly in the field of native journalism,\r\nand it deserved a wide reputation.  In later years the `Izwi',\r\nanother native journal, appeared on the scene; and then\r\nthe King Williamstown pioneer could hardly hold its ground\r\nagainst the new rival.  The `Izwi', though somewhat too pronounced\r\nagainst the traditional policy of the Dutch, appealed to a large section\r\nmainly by reason of its Imperial sentiment.  The result was that\r\nMr. Tengo-Jabavu's paper began to sink into difficulties and had to cast about\r\nfor a financial rescuer.  Prominent supporters of the present Ministry\r\ncame to the rescue; three out of the ten members of the first Union Cabinet\r\nbecame shareholders in the sinking `Imvo', so that the editor,\r\nin a sense, cannot very well be blamed because his paper is native\r\nonly in language.  However, we do not think that he does full justice\r\nto his ministerial employers.\r\n\r\nGod forbid that we should ever find that our mind had become\r\nthe property of some one other than ourselves; but should\r\nsuch a misfortune ever overtake us, we should at least strive\r\nto serve our new proprietor diligently, and whenever our people\r\nare unanimously opposed to a policy, we should consider it a part of our duty\r\nto tell him so; but that is not Mr. Jabavu's way of serving a master.\r\nThroughout the course of a general election, we have known him\r\nto feed his masters (the S.A. party), upon flapdoodle,\r\nfabricating the mess out of imaginary native votes of confidence\r\nfor his masters' delectation, and leaving them to discover\r\nthe real ingredients of the dish, at the bottom of the poll,\r\nwhen the result has been declared.\r\n\r\nHe did the same thing in the case of the Natives' Land Bill.\r\nThus when he found that the trouble was organizing the Natives\r\non an unprecedented scale, and that the Native Press and the Native Congress\r\nwere unanimous in denouncing the Grobler-Sauer Bill,\r\na Reuter's telegram appeared in the newspapers purporting to give\r\nthe proceedings of a meeting of the Natives of King Williamstown,\r\nwho, it was alleged, approved of the Bill.  When the author reached\r\nKing Williamstown, during this visit, he found the King Williamstown Natives\r\ndisgusted with what they said was Reuter's speculation upon their feelings.\r\nBut Reuter's agent on the spot, whose office we also visited,\r\nknew nothing about the meeting.  The only meeting ever held in the place,\r\nwe were told, was one of nineteen persons presided over by Mr. Tengo-Jabavu,\r\nand when Mr. Jabavu asked the other eighteen Natives present in the meeting\r\nbesides him to signify their approval of the legislation,\r\nMr. W. D. Soga (a well-known native politician) asked the chairman\r\nto place a motion before the meeting, as he was ready to move an amendment.\r\nThe temper of the meeting having already shown itself unfavourably\r\nto the chairman's suggestion, the latter, instead of challenging\r\na positive defeat, suggested an adjournment.  This was agreed to\r\nfor the simple reason that nineteen persons were too few\r\nto express the wishes of the 100,000 Natives of King Williamstown.\r\nBut, the next morning, the message \"from Reuter's agent at King Williamstown\"\r\nappeared in all the daily papers, except that of King Williamstown,\r\nconveying the Natives' approval of the Bill, and Mr. Sauer, in Parliament,\r\nmade capital out of the \"mess\"-age.  But Mr. Tengo-Jabavu lived\r\nto rue his action in this matter before very long.  His authority,\r\nor rather his leadership, of the Natives, was put to the test in March, 1914,\r\nwhen he contested the Tembuland seat against Dr. W. B. Rubusana.\r\nDr. Rubusana had always been supposed to occupy the second place,\r\nand Mr. Jabavu the first place, in the estimation of the Natives\r\nof the Cape Province:  yet, to the surprise of everybody,\r\nMr. Jabavu, although assisted by the Dutch vote, polled only 294 votes,\r\nwhile Dr. Rubusana, who relied entirely on the coloured vote, polled 852.\r\n\r\nWe mentioned, in a previous chapter, the names of Principal Henderson\r\nand Mr. Tengo-Jabavu, as those whom we especially desired to interview\r\nduring our trip.  Having stated the fulfilment of this desire\r\nin regard to Mr. Henderson, we now proceed to state it\r\nin regard to Mr. Jabavu.\r\n\r\nThere was to be a meeting of the Natives of King Williamstown,\r\nin the Baptist Chapel, on November 3, 1913, to discuss the Natives' Land Act.\r\nTo this meeting we had been invited by telegram; and in going\r\nto King Williamstown we made up our mind to invite Mr. Jabavu\r\nto this meeting of Natives of his town, and in fact, to treat him\r\nwith the same respect as we had shown the Principal of Lovedale\r\nwith such happy results; but, to our horror, we found that Mr. Jabavu\r\nwas not only preaching the Backvelders' dangerous politics, that were ruinous\r\nto native interests, but that, besides their dangerous politics,\r\nhe had imbibed their baser quality of ingratitude.  For this man\r\nhad not only enjoyed our free hospitality on three occasions,\r\nwhen he visited up-country, and the hospitality of our relatives\r\nat various times in other parts, but when he was about to leave for Europe,\r\non a holiday jaunt, and wanted some one to take charge of his work,\r\nwe left our own affairs and went to King Williamstown, at our own expense,\r\nto fill that post, and we filled it without a fee; but, see his retaliation.\r\n\r\nWe reached King Williamstown on Saturday evening and called\r\nat Mr. Jabavu's house on Sunday afternoon.  Mrs. Jabavu said her husband\r\nhad gone to Stutterheim, and would be back by a late train.  On Monday morning\r\nwe called at Mr. Jabavu's office, and his son whom we saw said his father\r\nwould be there in the afternoon.  We called in the afternoon and was told\r\nthat he was inside and would see us later.  We waited from 2.30\r\ntill nearly 4 p.m., chatting with his son, while Mr. Jabavu was closeted\r\nin the next room, evidently unwilling to see us.  As his son had to leave,\r\nwe also went away, but returned to his office at 6 p.m., just an hour before\r\nthe opening of the public meeting to which we wished to invite him.\r\nMr. Jabavu sent a verbal message, with the young lady who had taken in\r\nour card to him, to the effect that he was not prepared to see us.\r\nThat in brief was our reception by the man who edits \"a native paper\".\r\n\r\nWe went to the meeting at the Baptist Chapel, which was a huge success.\r\nMr. W. Sebe presided.  The editor of the King Williamstown daily paper,\r\nan Englishman, attended the meeting in person and took notes for his paper,\r\nwhile no reporter represented the soi-disant native paper\r\nof King Williamstown.\r\n\r\nWhen the proceedings of the meeting appeared in the King Williamstown\r\nEnglish paper, Mr. Jabavu attempted to discount the report by writing\r\nin his own paper that \"the `Cape Mercury' evidently does not know that there\r\nare Natives and Natives, as well as King Williamstown and King Williamstown,\r\nthere being town and country,\" etc.  This being a veiled insinuation\r\nthat the rural native view was opposed to the urban native view\r\nat King Williamstown, we could not leave the matter unchallenged,\r\nso we posted the following challenge to Mr. Tengo-Jabavu, which he evidently\r\nfound it impossible to accept: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nDear Sir, --\r\n\r\n`Imvo' comments disparagingly on Monday's meeting, and adds that\r\nthe Natives who composed the meeting were a handful drawn by curiosity.\r\nNow, I challenge `Imvo', or Mr. Tengo-Jabavu, to call a series\r\nof three public meetings, anywhere in the district of King Williamstown.\r\nLet us both address these meetings immediately after the Natives' Land Act\r\nhas been read and interpreted to each.  We could address the meetings from\r\nthe same platform, or separately, but on the same day and at the same place.\r\nFor every vote carried at each of these meetings in favour of his views\r\non the Act I undertake to hand over 15 Pounds to the Grey Hospital\r\n(King Williamstown), and 15 Pounds to the Victoria Hospital (Lovedale),\r\non condition that for every vote I carry at any of the meetings,\r\nhe hand over 15 Pounds to the Victoria Hospital (Mafeking),\r\nand 15 Pounds to the Carnarvon Hospital (Kimberley).\r\n\r\nThat is 30 Pounds for charity, if he will accept.\r\n\r\nI will not place difficulties in his way by inviting him to meetings up here,\r\nbut leave him to call meetings among his own people (if he has any)\r\nin his own district, and I will attend at my own expense.\r\n\r\n                         Yours, etc.\r\n                           (Sgd.)  Sol. T. Plaatje,\r\n  Editor of `Tsala ea Batho', and Secretary S.A. Native National Congress.\r\n14, Shannon Street, Kimberley.\r\n==\r\n\r\n==\r\n                                \"IMVO'S\" REPLY\r\n\r\nDear Sir, --  I am instructed by the Editor of \"Imvo\" to acknowledge\r\nthe receipt of your letter, and to inform you that as he has not been\r\nreading and following your writings, etc., he cannot understand\r\nwhat you mean by it.  In short, to let you know that he takes no interest\r\nin the matter.\r\n\r\n                    I am, Sir,\r\n                         Yours truly,\r\n                           (Sgd.)  A. M. Jabavu.\r\n\"Imvo\" Office, King Williamstown,\r\n  November 24, 1913.\r\n==\r\n\r\nPoor fellow!  He had not met a single member of the Government\r\nsince the plague law was so rudely sprung upon an unsuspecting country,\r\nand since it sent unprotected widows and innocent children adrift,\r\nto wander about with their belongings on their heads.\r\nMr. Jabavu had not met any member of Parliament and discussed the measure\r\nwith him or with a responsible Government official; so he found it awkward\r\nto accept a challenge to substantiate his arguments, in the presence of one\r\nwho had not only discussed the measure with members of Parliament,\r\nwith Cabinet Ministers and their representatives, but who had also witnessed\r\nthe ravages of the Act amongst the Natives in the country.\r\n\r\nThe general complaint of the Natives of King Williamstown,\r\nhis fellow-townsmen, is that he refuses to attend their meetings and relies\r\non the white daily papers for information about the Natives at large.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Jabavu is nothing if he is not selfish.  We are informed,\r\nand have every reason to believe, that, three months after the Act was passed,\r\nhe wanted to raise a loan of 200 Pounds on landed security,\r\nbut was debarred by the Natives' Land Act.  The next issue of his paper\r\npraised the Act for the sixtieth time and noted the following exception:\r\n\"There is only one flaw in this otherwise useful Act,\r\nwhich is occasioning a manifest hardship through harsh administration,\r\nand that is the provision relating to lending money.\"\r\n\r\nNow, from our point of view, this seems to be the only defensible provision,\r\nas it would tend to discourage usury, a common evil in money transactions\r\nbetween Europeans and Natives; but because it interfered\r\nwith Mr. Jabavu's personal aims, that is the only flaw.\r\nThe cold-blooded evictions and the Draconian principle\r\nagainst living anywhere, except as serfs, are inconsequential\r\nbecause they have not yet touched Mr. Jabavu's person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV     The Native Congress and the Union Government\r\n\r\n  Pity and need make all flesh kin.  There is no caste in blood\r\n    which runneth of one hue; nor caste in tears, which trickle salt with all.\r\n                                       Sir Edwin Arnold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA native meeting was called to meet at Johannesburg on July 25, 1913,\r\nunder the auspices of the South African Native Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Congress was attended by Natives from as far south\r\nas East London and King Williamstown, and from as far north\r\nas the Zoutpansbergen in Northern Transvaal, and also from Natal, Zululand,\r\nand from Bechuanaland; in fact from nearer and distant centres\r\nin all parts of the country they had gathered to discuss\r\nthe situation arising from the serious conditions created\r\nby the Natives' Land Act.  Thus the proceedings of the meeting\r\nwere conducted under a grave sense of responsibility.\r\nThere was little of the customary loquaciousness which characterizes\r\nnative gatherings; and there was much less free translation of the speeches\r\nfor the benefit of the European visitors.  Translations, as a rule,\r\ntake up a great deal of valuable time, and it was their curtailment\r\non this occasion, apparently, which caused the `Transvaal Leader'\r\n-- a morning paper of the Rand -- to complain that Natives\r\nhad become unusually secretive and had ceased to be as communicative\r\nas at previous meetings.  The `Rand Daily Mail', on the other hand,\r\nreferred to the closing session in a very few lines.  It said:\r\n\"Last evening, a number of Native women attended the Native Congress,\r\nattired as befitting the solemnity and importance of the occasion.\r\nThe orderly behaviour of the 200 or more delegates was attributable\r\nto the presence on the platform of Mr. Dube, an able chairman,\r\nsupported by two native solicitors who passed their B.A. in London.\"\r\n\r\nMr. R. W. Msimang is a solicitor who was articled to\r\na firm of solicitors in England; but the reference to\r\nthe second \"native solicitor\" and \"London B.A.\" is about\r\nthe most undeserved compliment ever paid to the author,\r\nwho, until 1914 (a year after the Congress reported by the `Mail'),\r\nhad never been on board a ship, nor inside a London college.\r\n\r\nAt the annual Congress, March, 1913, a deputation had been appointed\r\nto proceed to Capetown and to present to the Government the native objections\r\nagainst the proposed embargo on the purchase and lease of land.\r\nThe deputation consisted of Mr. J. L. Dube, Dr. W. B. Rubusana,\r\nMr. Advocate Mangena, Rev. L. Dlepu, Messrs. W. Z. Fenyang, S. Msane,\r\nL. T. Mvabaza, D. Le Tanka, and S. T. Plaatje; the writer, however,\r\nwas not able to proceed to Capetown at the time.  The July Congress\r\nwas specially called to receive the report of the delegates to Capetown,\r\nand further to consider what other steps it might be necessary to take.\r\n\r\nDr. Rubusana gave a report on the deputation to Capetown.  They had\r\nfour interviews with the Minister of Native Affairs, and several interviews\r\nwith members of Parliament, urging the setting aside of some Government farms,\r\nto which evicted native tenants might go, as the effect of the Bill,\r\nthen under discussion, would inevitably be to make numbers of them homeless.\r\nThe Minister, he said, never denied the possible hardship\r\nthat would follow the enforcement of such a law, but he seemed to be driven\r\nby a mysterious force in the face of which the native interest did not count.\r\nWhat that force was, he said, could only be surmised.  General Hertzog,\r\nwho had always advocated some such measure (though he had never been able\r\nto carry it out), had just been excluded from the Botha Cabinet;\r\nto placate his supporters, who were very angry over his dismissal,\r\nthe Government carried out this alleged policy of his,\r\nso that while General Hertzog in office was not able to bring about\r\nthe enslavement of the blacks, General Hertzog out of office succeeded\r\nin getting the Government to sacrifice their principles of right and justice\r\nand to force the Act through Parliament, in order to retain\r\nthe support of the \"Free\" State malcontents.\r\n\r\nWhen every effort with the Ministry failed, the delegates asked\r\nfor a postponement of the Bill pending the report of the Commission.\r\nThis also was refused by the Government.  Finally he wrote a letter\r\nto Lord Gladstone, asking him to withhold his assent to the Bill\r\nuntil he had heard the native view.  To this His Excellency replied\r\nthat such a course was \"not within his constitutional functions\".\r\nAll this took place in May, 1913.\r\n\r\nIn July, Mr. Dube, the president of the Congress, wrote to Lord Gladstone\r\nasking for an interview to lay before him the nature of the damage\r\nthat the Act was causing among the native population.  Again His Excellency\r\nreplied that it was \"not within his constitutional functions\".\r\n\r\nThe Natives' Land Act, which was then law, was read to the assembled Natives,\r\nmost of whom narrated their experiences and the result of their observations\r\nof the effect of the Act during the six weeks that it had been in force.\r\nCongress considered these, and as a result of their deliberations\r\nit was resolved to appeal to His Majesty's Government; and also to take steps\r\nto apprise the British public of the mode of government carried on\r\nin British South Africa under the Union Jack, and to invoke their assistance\r\nto abrogate the obnoxious law that had brought the Congress together.\r\n\r\nThe Congress considered at length how His Majesty the King\r\nand the British public could best help the Natives in these matters;\r\nand it was concluded that if South Africa were really British,\r\nthen any suffering taking place in that country must be of concern\r\nto His Majesty the King and the British public.  The next point\r\nfor inquiry by the Congress was the journey of a deputation to be chosen\r\nto proceed on this mission, a journey consisting of six thousand miles by sea\r\nand a thousand miles by rail.  When the Europeans of South Africa\r\nwent to England to ask the Imperial Government for a Constitution,\r\ntheir delegates were easily sent, because the native taxpayers,\r\nalthough with hardly any hope of benefiting by the gift\r\n-- which amounted to a curtailment of their rights -- were compelled\r\nto contribute to the travelling and other expenses of these envoys;\r\nbut in the Natives' own case no such funds are at his disposal,\r\neven though he goes to the Imperial Government to point out\r\nthat his taxes had been used by a Parliament in which he is unrepresented\r\nas a rod for his back.  In order to meet this necessary demand for\r\nways and means, Mr. Msane was deputed to tour the country and ask for funds\r\nfrom the Natives.  A Johannesburg committee was appointed\r\nto superintend this effort and take charge of the funds which he might raise.\r\nThe members of the said committee were:  Messrs. W. F. Jemsana (chairman),\r\nElka M. Cele (treasurer), D. S. Letanka, R. W. Msimang, H. D. Mkize,\r\nB. G. Phooko, D. D. Tywakadi, D. Moeletsi, M. D. Ndabezita,\r\nH. Selby Msimang (hon. sec.), S. Msane (organizer).  Finally a deputation\r\nwas appointed to proceed to Pretoria to lay before the Union Government\r\nthree resolutions that the Congress passed.  The first,\r\ncondoling with the Government on the death of Hon. J. W. Sauer,\r\nlate Minister of Justice and Native Affairs, who died just as the Congress\r\nwas about to meet; the second resolution, that the Natives\r\ndissociated themselves entirely from the industrial struggles\r\non the Witwatersrand and elsewhere, and preferred to seek redress\r\nfor their grievances through constitutional rather than by violent means.\r\n\r\nThe third resolution, that humble representations to the authorities against\r\nthe eviction of Natives from farms, having proved unavailing, the Natives\r\nhad now decided to raise funds for the purpose and convey their appeal\r\nto His Majesty the King and to the British public.  That Mr. Msane\r\nhad been appointed organizer of the appeal fund and that a safe conduct\r\nwas requested for him to tour the native villages.  The following deputation\r\nwas appointed to present these resolutions to the Union Government\r\nat Pretoria:  Chief Karl Kekana and Mr. S. M. Makgatho of the Transvaal,\r\nMr. E. Mamba of the Transkei (Cape), Mr. Saul Msane and Rev. R. Twala (Natal),\r\nMr. S. T. Plaatje (Kimberley), and Mr. J. M. Nyokong\r\nof the Orange \"Free\" State.\r\n\r\nMr. S. F. Malan, the Minister for Native Affairs pro tem.\r\nreceived the deputation in the Government Buildings,\r\nwhich were the Transvaal Houses of Parliament before Union.\r\nWith the Minister of Native Affairs were Messrs. E. Barrett,\r\nAssistant Secretary for Native Affairs, Mr. Pritchard,\r\nthe Johannesburg Commissioner, and Mr. Cross, a Rand Magistrate.\r\nThe Minister readily received the resolutions and confessed to\r\na feeling of relief at the moderation of their tone.  Further,\r\nhe listened to the story of hardships already suffered by the Natives,\r\nas a result of the enforcement of the Land Act, specific instances of which\r\nwere given, some being of Natives not far from Pretoria,\r\nwho, after being evicted from their old homes and having found new homes,\r\nwere told by the Commissioner that they could not settle therein.\r\n\r\nThe delegates submitted to the Minister that their complaint\r\nwas not a sentimental grievance, but real physical suffering.\r\nThe Minister having listened to these statements, pointed out\r\nthat this Act was the law of the land, which must be obeyed.\r\nHe was not so sure, he said, that the Natives could achieve anything\r\nby means of a deputation to England as the law had already been signed\r\nby His Majesty's representative on the spot without hesitation.\r\nHe could not see why the Natives should be interfered with\r\nwhen holding meetings and organizing a deputation to go to the King,\r\nas long as they kept within the four corners of the law.  But it seemed to him\r\nthat they should have waited until a commission had been appointed\r\nunder Sections 2 and 3 of the Act.  An appeal to the Sovereign, he added,\r\nwas the inherent right of every British subject; but he expressed the desire\r\nthat the appeal to England should be dropped until the commission\r\nhad first made its report.  The delegates explained that as the law\r\nhad in six weeks done so much harm, it was alarming to think\r\nwhat it might do in six months, while there was nothing definite to hope for\r\nfrom the report of a commission not yet appointed, and whose report\r\nmight conceivably take six years.\r\n\r\nThe deputation made it clear that the appeal to the King\r\nwould be dropped if the Government undertook to amend the law\r\npending the report of the commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE NATIVES' LAND ACT IN NATAL\r\n\r\nIn the following months both the Minister in charge of Native Affairs\r\nand the Chief Native Commissioner of Natal asked Rev. John L. Dube,\r\nPresident of the S.A. Native National Congress, to furnish them\r\nwith information and particulars of Natives in misery\r\nas a result of the Natives' Land Act.  Mr. Dube had been collecting\r\nsome concrete cases of hardship, including Chief Sandanazwe of Evansdale,\r\nWaschbank, who stated that he and fifty members of his tribe\r\n\"are given notice to remove, and that he has made representations\r\nto the authorities in Maritzburg asking for land without success.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dube sent the following letter to the Secretary for Native Affairs,\r\nwith a list of evicted farm tenants, on September 12, 1913.\r\n\r\n==\r\nSir, --\r\n\r\nThe Chief Native Commissioner for Natal approached me\r\nshortly after the publication in the Press of my open letter*\r\nwith a request similar to that made by you, viz., that I should furnish him\r\nwith particulars and information.  From time to time\r\nI did so furnish those names to the Chief Commissioner,\r\nand I send you herewith a list of those names and also additional names\r\nwhich have come to my knowledge since my correspondence\r\nwith the Chief Native Commissioner.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* Mr. Dube was here referring to an open letter which he sent\r\n  to the `Natal Press', explaining the hard lot of the Native victims\r\n  of the Act, and appealing to the colonists to intercede\r\n  with the South African Government on behalf of the sufferers.\r\n--\r\n\r\nIn regard to the concluding paragraph of your letter to the effect\r\nthat the only result of the Chief Native Commissioner's request\r\nwas the submission of the case of a Native in the Weenen County\r\nwho received notice from his landlord over a year ago,\r\nyou must be misinformed.  As you will see from the list,\r\nscores of names were furnished to the Native Commissioner, and furthermore,\r\nsome of the individuals themselves who were suffering hardship\r\nwere sent by me to the Chief Commissioner and were interviewed by him.\r\nThe trouble has been that the Chief Commissioner, instead of dealing\r\nwith these individual cases himself, has, I am informed, in many instances,\r\nsent the individuals on to the Magistrates, and my letters also\r\nhave been forwarded to the Magistrates, with the request that Magistrates\r\nwould go into the matter.  However anxious the Magistrates may be\r\nto help in this matter they are but human, and in many cases,\r\nI am informed, they are overweighed with other work and have been unable\r\nto give the attention to these matters that they required.\r\nMoreover the Magistrate acts purely as an official, and the Native\r\nwho is wandering about the country helpless does not get\r\nthe immediate sympathy and attention which his case deserves and demands.\r\nIn many cases the individuals I sent on are under the impression,\r\nrightly or wrongly, that nothing is being done for their relief.\r\n\r\nIf I might make a suggestion, it would be that some independent gentleman\r\nshould be appointed to investigate these cases -- some gentleman\r\nwho would have sufficient time to devote to the investigation\r\nof the various instances of hardship that would come before him,\r\nand who would be empowered to do what was necessary to relieve the deserving.\r\n\r\nI may say further that since the introduction of the Squatters Bill\r\nduring the 1912 session of Parliament eviction by farmers has been\r\nmuch increased, possibly in view of the impression that prevailed generally\r\namong the farming community that the Squatters Bill or some similar measure\r\nwas to be re-introduced by the Government, the result being that those Natives\r\nwho had been evicted by farmers now the Natives' Land Bill has become law,\r\nare prevented from entering into agreements with land owners\r\nas rent-paying tenants, and only under servile conditions, with the result\r\nthat in many cases they become wandering and helpless vagrants.\r\n\r\nAnother form of hardship which prevails very generally\r\nas the result of the Natives' Land Act is this:  The younger Natives\r\ndo not receive the wage from farmers as can be easily earned,\r\nsay, on the Rand mines, with the result that the younger men\r\nleave their homes and their fathers and proceed to the mines;\r\nthe father is unable to supply the labour demanded by the landlord\r\nowing to the absence of his sons, and as a result he is evicted --\r\nmany cases of this sort can be cited.\r\n\r\nI may here cite two cases within my personal knowledge:\r\n(1) Bhulose was living on Mr. R. Miller's farm, \"Dalmeny\",\r\nnear Phoenix.  He was evicted with his wife and family in June last.\r\nHe is seeking a place now to reside on, but cannot obtain one.\r\n(2) A native woman Vatplank, a widow with a family, was evicted\r\nfrom the property of a farmer, Mr. Adendorff, near Newcastle; this woman\r\nwith all her household goods and her family had to camp out on the veld.\r\nShe was barred by the Act from going to neighbouring farmers for a residence.\r\n\r\nI have done my utmost to give you concrete examples and names of persons\r\nsuffering hardship.  If I can supplement the information\r\ncontained in this letter and in the accompanying list I shall only be\r\ntoo happy to do so.\r\n\r\nMight I suggest further that you should ask the Chief Native Commissioner\r\nto forward to you all my correspondence with him on this matter?\r\nThis will show you and the Government that the statements contained\r\nin my open letter are not mere fabrications, but are based upon solid facts.\r\n\r\n                                   John L. Dube.\r\n==\r\n\r\nMr. Dube's list includes evictions from the districts of Greytown,\r\nNew Hanover, Ekukanyeni, Homeless (a very appropriate name\r\nin the circumstances), Howick, Estcourt, and Mid-Illovu.\r\n\r\nHere is a specimen of notice: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nI hereby give you Mandwasi notice to leave my farm Blinkwater\r\nby the end of July, 1913.\r\n\r\n                              (Sgd.)\r\n  July 20, 1913.                   Freestone Ridge.\r\n==\r\n\r\n\"The wheels of administration moved slowly\" (to borrow an official phrase)\r\nbetween the Native Affairs Department and the other departments of State.\r\nThus, while the authorities were temporizing with this\r\nand similar representations, the Natives' Land Act was scattering the Natives\r\nabout the country, creating alarm and panic in different places.\r\nThe high officials of State, instead of relieving the distress thus caused,\r\nwere interviewing Natives and urging them not to send a deputation to Europe.\r\nThe Natives received this advice hopefully.  They believed\r\nit was an indication that the Government was about to amend the law,\r\nin which case, of course, the deputation would be unnecessary;\r\nbut, besides this advice, the officials in each instance promised no relief.\r\n\r\nThe Natal Native Commissioner held a similar meeting with a number of Zulus.\r\nThe meeting asked for some relief for the evicted tenants\r\nwho were roaming about the country, but the official significantly\r\nevaded the point.  The disappointment of the meeting, created by\r\nhis evasive replies, having overcome the proverbial native timidity\r\nwhen in the presence of authority, resulted in one petty chief\r\nsaying to the Commissioner:  \"Local authorities levy a tax every year\r\non each of our dogs.  We don't know what they do with the money.\r\nYou have never complained against that waste, so why should you complain\r\nif our money is spent in sending a deputation to the King?\"  The answer,\r\nif there was one, is not reported.\r\n\r\nGeneral Botha, until then, never met native tax-payers\r\nto discuss their grievances with them.  But in the latter part of 1913,\r\nhe actually met some Natives in the Eastern Transvaal, who desired\r\nto inform him of the ravages of the Act.  But instead of holding out any hope\r\nthat an asylum would be found for the wanderers, he proceeded\r\nto advise them against sending a deputation to England.  The Natives\r\nhaving given specific instances of the plight of certain evicted tenants\r\nin the neighbourhood, asked for an abode for them, but on that point\r\nthe Premier would not be drawn.  The Government's indifference\r\nto native sufferings being thus revealed, the Natives of Vryheid\r\nbecame more eager to help to organize the proposed deputation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Botha's efforts against the deputation, without offering any homes\r\nto the evicted Natives, was probably the best stimulus\r\ntowards the deputation fund.  The Premier visited a northern tribe\r\nsome time after and was said to have warned the chief and his people\r\nagainst the pretensions of the Native Congress.  When Mr. Dube called there\r\na few days later, they handed him 200 Pounds towards the deputation fund,\r\nwhich they had collected since General Botha's visit.  Mr. Saul Msane\r\nsimilarly raised 360 Pounds for the fund in the Eastern Transvaal\r\nwhere the Premier first warned the Natives against the deputation\r\nwithout offering them any relief.\r\n\r\nThose Natives who were not immediately affected by the Act\r\nwere rather lukewarm regarding the proposed deputation.\r\nBut when the officials warned them against wasting their money on a deputation\r\nand told them in the next breath that it was a breach of the law\r\nto find an abode for the evicted wanderers, these Natives,\r\nperceiving the hollowness of the Government's advice,\r\ndetermined that as a last resort a deputation should be sent to England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV      The Kimberley Congress / The Kimberley Conference\r\n\r\n  Sorrow like this draws parted lives in one, and knits anew the rents\r\n    which time has made.\r\n                                       Lewis Morris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen everything was ready another special Congress was called\r\nto meet at Johannesburg in February, to carry out the deputation's scheme\r\nand appoint the delegates to proceed to England.  In view of\r\nthe dissatisfaction of the Government after the July Congress,\r\nthe author considered it his duty to inform the Government\r\nthat a meeting was about to take place.  This information\r\ncalled forth a peremptory intimation from the Government\r\nthat because of the recent strike of white men (from which the Natives\r\nhad publicly disassociated themselves) the Native Congress could not be held.\r\nBut at the time that this telegraphic prohibition reached us\r\nGeneral Smuts, Minister of Defence, was announcing in Parliament that\r\nthe embargo on public meetings, in areas where, owing to the recent strike\r\n(of January, 1914), martial law was proclaimed, had been removed.\r\nLogically then General Botha's decision made the previous day\r\nin regard to the Congress meeting fell to the ground; and so we telegraphed\r\nto Senator Schreiner and Dr. Watkins, members of Parliament,\r\nto ascertain if this was so.  Both these gentlemen answered\r\nthat in spite of the removal of the prohibition of public meetings of whites,\r\nthe Prime Minister directs that the one in regard to the \"Native Congress\"\r\nmust stand.  Thereupon the writer, after consulting a few native residents\r\nin Kimberley, intimated to the executive of the Congress that:\r\n\r\n==\r\nKimberley, my home, is not yet a Republic in its sentiments.\r\nThere we have not reached the stage where some one's permission\r\nmust be asked before a meeting can be held.  So we invite the Congress\r\nto hospitable and British Kimberley, where public meetings close\r\nwith singing the British National Anthem and not with singing\r\nthe \"Volkslied\" or the \"Red Flag\", as is the case in meetings\r\nat some other South African centres.\r\n==\r\n\r\nAfter the notices were out the Government sent an intimation to the effect\r\nthat the Congress was not actually prohibited.  That it was only deemed\r\nundesirable to allow it to be held at Johannesburg, where a strike\r\nhad taken place; and that even there the Government no longer objected,\r\nprovided it be held indoors.  But this belated reconsideration was unnecessary\r\nas the Kimberley preparations were far advanced and some of the delegates\r\nwere already on their way to Kimberley.\r\n\r\nThe Congress was opened in St. John's Hall at 10 a.m. on\r\nFriday morning, February 27, 1914, by the Rt. Rev. W. Gore-Browne,\r\nBishop of Kimberley and Kuruman.  His lordship was accompanied\r\nby Archdeacon de Rougemont and Rev. I. I. Hlangwana of St. Paul's Mission,\r\nwho gave out the native hymns.  In the absence of the president,\r\nwho reached Kimberley in the afternoon of that day, the Bishop\r\nwas received by Mr. Makgatho, vice-president of the Congress.\r\nAfter the religious exercise had ended, the Bishop counselled the Congress\r\nnot to ask for a repeal of the whole Act, but only for relief\r\nfrom the oppressive clauses, and then to wait for the Commission's report\r\nin regard to the remainder of the Act.  \"There may be something good in it,\"\r\nadded the Bishop, \"as the glittering diamonds of Kimberley are found\r\nin blue clay.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Makgatho, in thanking the Bishop for opening the Congress, thanked him\r\nfor the allegory, but added, however, that he had never heard of a father\r\nwho said to his child, \"You are hungry, my son, and I am going\r\nto prepare some dinner for you, but meanwhile you had better wait outside\r\nin the rain.\"  After the Bishop gave the Congress his benediction,\r\nPrince Malunge-Ka-Mban-deni of Swaziland was introduced to him,\r\nas were the Chiefs Molotlegi and Mamogale of Transvaal,\r\nMoiloa of the Bahurutshe, and Messrs. Elka M. Cele of Natal,\r\nMeshach Pelem from the Cape, J. M. Nyokong, S. Litheko of the O.F.S.,\r\nand other native leaders.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a large public reception was held in the City Hall\r\nin honour of the delegates.  Kimberley joined wholeheartedly in the function.\r\nDe Beers Company, which had hitherto shown the greatest hospitality\r\nonly to European assemblies and not to native conferences and organizations,\r\nacted otherwise in the case of this Congress and its requirements.\r\nPresumably Mr. Pickering, the secretary of De Beers, had had information\r\nthat even the mining labourers in the enclosed mining compounds were\r\nheart and soul with their countrymen outside; and so the Company's hospitality\r\nwas extended to the native delegates.\r\n\r\nBioscope films were projected by Mr. I. Joshua, the chairman of the A.P.O.,\r\nMessrs. Lakey and September, other A.P.O. committee men, acting as\r\nmasters of ceremonies.  The coloured people attended in their hundreds,\r\nand cheered the musicians of their native brethren who entertained the people\r\nwho thronged the City Hall till many were refused admission.\r\nThe Coloured People's Organization sent a speaker, Mr. H. Van Rooyen,\r\nto welcome the delegates on behalf of the African Political Organization.\r\nThe president of their Ladies' Guild, Mrs. Van der Riet,\r\na school teacher and musician of long standing, attended and played\r\nthe accompaniment for the Greenport Choir on the pianoforte;\r\nMiss M. Ntsiko, who had borne the brunt of the evening's accompaniment,\r\nwas thus relieved.\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Kokozela, on behalf of the Kimberley and Beaconsfield\r\nbranches of the Congress, welcomed the Congress to Kimberley,\r\nand presented Mr. Dube, the president, with an address,\r\nwhich was beautifully illuminated by the Sisters of St. Joseph Convent,\r\nof Mafeking.  Mr. H. Van Rooyen associated his people with the Natives\r\nin their present struggle for existence, and Dr. J. E. Mackenzie,\r\nwho spoke on behalf of the Europeans, made a fine speech.\r\nHe said that nobility was not confined to any particular race or colour;\r\nthat men with black skins have been known to be just as noble\r\nas men with white skins.  Amongst other questions he asked,\r\n\"What could be more noble than the Bedford boy leader who subsequently became\r\nthe St. Augustine of Central Africa, or what could be more noble\r\nthan the action of the two servants of Dr. Livingstone, who carried his body,\r\nfor hundreds of miles, through difficult forests, to the coast,\r\nand thus ensured his burial in Westminster Abbey?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Mackenzie's speech was afterwards referred to by several native delegates\r\nto the Congress.  They said that before they came to Kimberley\r\nthey felt certain that English ideas were utterly obliterated\r\nin the Union of South Africa, and that English sentiments\r\nwere things of the past; but that Dr. Mackenzie's speech had given them\r\nfresh hope, as it was like cold water to a traveller in the desert.\r\nIt was, they said further, like a dream to hear a white man talk like that\r\nin a mixed audience.\r\n\r\nThe Congress received sympathetic telegrams from such\r\nold residents of Kimberley as Sir David Harris and Dr. Watkins.\r\nBoth these gentlemen telegraphed their felicitations from Parliament.\r\n\r\nMr. H. A. Oliver, member for Kimberley, a great Wesleyan\r\nand Sunday School leader, who was at Capetown for the Parliamentary session,\r\ninstructed his manager at Kimberley to book seats on his account\r\nfor the senior classes of the Newton Wesleyan Sunday School\r\nto attend the Congress entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe Resident Magistrate of Kimberley telephoned to us on this same day\r\nthat he had received the following telegram from the Secretary\r\nfor Native Affairs: --\r\n\r\n\"LEAVING TO-NIGHT FOR KIMBERLEY TO ATTEND THE NATIVE CONGRESS.\r\nINFORM PLAATJE.\"\r\n\r\nIt had never previously happened that a representative of the Government\r\nattended a coloured political assembly, and it was felt\r\nthat wiser councils had prevailed with the Government,\r\nand that as a result it had decided to meet the Natives, at least half-way.\r\nIf gambling was one of the indulgences of the Natives,\r\nsome at least of the delegates would have wagered that Mr. Dower\r\nwas conveying a concession to the Native Congress, by which\r\nit would be unnecessary for the latter to send a deputation to England.\r\nSo thoroughly was the idea of a concession associated\r\nin the mind of the Congress with the approaching visit of Mr. Dower\r\nthat it postponed the election of delegates for the mission to England.\r\nThis anticipation was a reasonable one as the Union's recent legislation\r\nwas in the melting-pot.\r\n\r\nThe law against British Indians, passed at the same time\r\nas the Natives' Land Act, was just then recommended for modification,\r\nunder pressure brought to bear upon the Imperial Government\r\nby the Government of India and other agencies.  Again, the Labour members\r\nwere creating difficulties both at Capetown and Westminster\r\nover General Smuts's Deportation Bill, which compelled the Government\r\nto amend its conditional banishment clause -- a hardship that was not\r\nas vital or as absolute as the banishment clauses against black tenants\r\nin the Natives' Land Act.  Consequently, the native delegates to Congress,\r\nrepresenting as they did an overwhelming majority of the inhabitants\r\nof South Africa -- a section that had received nothing but violent legislation\r\nfrom the South African Parliament since the inauguration of Union --\r\nhad every reason to expect that, for the first time,\r\na Government emissary was carrying an olive branch to the Natives;\r\nbut, alas! unlike the industrial strikers, the Natives had no votes\r\nto create a constitutional difficulty; unlike the British Indians, they have\r\nno Indian Government at their back; therefore, their vital interests,\r\nbeing negligible, could comfortably be relegated to the regions of oblivion,\r\nand this hope, like all its predecessors, was falsified.\r\n\r\nMr. Dower attended the Congress on Saturday, February 28,\r\nand again on Monday, March 2, and made speeches.\r\n\r\nHe was profuse in expressions of the gratitude of the Government\r\nto the Natives, their leaders and their chiefs, for the loyal co-operation\r\nthey have always rendered the authorities, and he came to ask them,\r\nhe said, to perpetuate that loyal co-operation and to refrain\r\nfrom appealing to Great Britain on the Natives' Land Act.\r\nTo appeal would be to put back the clock of the Native Affairs Department\r\nfor many years.  Of course, it did not matter about\r\nthe putting back of the Natives' own clock, since its only use\r\nis that of an index for the registration of Government taxes,\r\nmunicipal pass fees at one shilling or more per month per Native,\r\nand similar phases of the black man's burden.  Thus, in answer to questions\r\nput by the members of the Congress, Mr. Dower was not able to say\r\nthat one iota of the provisions of that Draconian law would be modified\r\nbefore the Commission made its report, nor could he give a pledge\r\nin the name of the Government that if the Commission reported\r\nfavourably to the Natives, Parliament would carry into effect\r\nthe Commission's report, even though the pledge sought\r\ntook no account of the possibility of the Commission's report being hostile\r\nto the interests of the Natives.  This then was the character of the visit\r\nwhich the Government Secretary paid to the Native Congress.\r\nIt was entirely barren of results, and as such it left the Congress\r\nas it found it, in bewilderment and gloom.\r\n\r\nFresh fears took hold of the Congress.  When the commissioners' names\r\nwere gazetted, they were not received with any great amount of enthusiasm\r\nby the native population, for the best that could be thought\r\nof the Natives' Land Commissioners was that they were not associated\r\nwith any political party.  With such a view, it can be understood\r\nwhat were the feelings of the Congress when it thereafter learnt\r\nthat four of the five commissioners were present, as delegates,\r\nat the conference of the Ministerial party held at Capetown two months before\r\n(the conference at which Generals Hertzog and De Wet definitely severed\r\ntheir connexion with General Botha), nor was there anything to show\r\nthat the fifth commissioner was not there also.  Therefore, the situation\r\namounted to this, that this Land Commission, which should be\r\ncomposed of impartial members, or, if made up of party politicians,\r\nit should at any rate represent the three political parties\r\nas well as the Natives, was in reality but a branch of the Ministerial party\r\nwhich foisted this very Land Act upon the country.\r\n\r\nIt was finally resolved to appoint a deputation of five\r\nto accompany the president, Mr. Dube, to England if further efforts failed.\r\nThe Congress nominated nine names, and the election of five delegates\r\nfrom these was entrusted to a committee of fourteen members of the Congress,\r\nwho balloted for five and reported the result to the full Congress\r\nas follows: --\r\n\r\n    S. T. Plaatje        13\r\n    S. M. Makgatho        9\r\n    Saul Msane            6\r\n    W. Z. Fenyang         3\r\n    T. M. Mapikela        3\r\n    Dr. W. B. Rubusana    2\r\n    A. K. Soga            2\r\n    M. Pellem             2\r\n    Chief Mamogale        1\r\n\r\nThe first-named five were therefore declared elected.  Mr. Fenyang\r\nsubsequently stood down in favour of Dr. Rubusana; Mr. Makgatho was not able\r\nto reach Capetown in time for the steamer's departure, so the deputation\r\nthat eventually accompanied the president to England were: --\r\n\r\n    1.  Dr. Rubusana.\r\n    2.  S. T. Plaatje.\r\n    3.  Saul Msane.\r\n    4.  T. M. Mapikela.\r\n\r\nTheir instructions were first to approach the Prime Minister and ask him\r\nto undertake on behalf of his parliamentary majority to repeal\r\nthe Natives' Land Act, failing that, to endeavour at least\r\nto get the clause rescinded which prevents evicted native tenants\r\nfrom finding settlements anywhere except as servants, and that\r\nif the Prime Minister should refuse to grant this request, they were forthwith\r\nto appeal to the Imperial Parliament and the British public.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the Congress, before it rose, received telegraphic\r\nadvices from Mr. Gibson of the Cape Church Council, and also from\r\nthe Hon. W. P. Schreiner, not to appeal to England.  These communications\r\nencouraged the delegates to believe that intermediate relief was being\r\narranged for, to ameliorate the condition of the wandering evicted Natives,\r\nin which case there would, of course, be no occasion to appeal to England.\r\nBut it subsequently transpired that the Natives were advised against\r\nmaking an appeal to England without the offer of any relief.\r\n\r\nBefore Congress rose votes of thanks were passed in favour of\r\nthe Bishop of Kimberley and Kuruman, the De Beers Company,\r\nthe `Diamond Fields Advertiser' for its liberal reports of the proceedings,\r\nMr. Dower for entertaining the delegates to a dinner on Monday,\r\nand also to the residents of Kimberley.\r\n\r\nThe special thanks of the Congress were voiced by Mr. Makgatho\r\nto the various committees, whose strenuous efforts for\r\nthe comfort of the delegates left nothing to be desired.  These were: --\r\n\r\n                         COMMITTEES OF LOCAL BRANCHES\r\n\r\nKIMBERLEY. --  Messrs. Thos. Leeuw (chairman), S. Marogo (treasurer),\r\nBill Tshabalala, H. Ndlovu, Z. Jumane, A. R. Mashoko, T. Diniso (secretary).\r\n\r\nBEACONSFIELD. --  Messrs. J. Smith (chairman), W. January,\r\nS. Pehla (treasurer), Jas. Ngcezula, Ntshenge, B. Mradu,\r\nJ. S. Kokozela (secretary).\r\n\r\nLOCAL ACCOMMODATION AND REFRESHMENTS COMMITTEE:  Mesdames J. Smith,\r\nS. Sidziya, M. Mahuma, S. Kawa, Mildred Kokozela and L. Skota;\r\nMessrs. J. Chologi, J. Matsebe, S. Pehla, Soga, J. Ngcezula and A. Ntshoko.\r\n\r\nCITY HALL RECEPTION COMMITTEE:  Mesdames J. J. van der Riet and M. Ntsiko;\r\nMessrs. Isaac P. Joshua, Sidney Motlhabi, P. W. Mama, T. Diniso,\r\nTony Msengana and J. G. Motlhabi.\r\n\r\nAn honorarium of 10 Pounds was voted in favour of the honorary secretary,\r\nMr. S. T. Plaatje.\r\n\r\nAfter the deputation reached Capetown on May 13, 1914, we wrote Lord Gladstone\r\ninforming him that we were bearers of a petition from the native population\r\nto His Majesty the King, which we would ask His Excellency\r\nto graciously convey.  Of course we expected a short note from His Excellency\r\nto the effect that \"it was not within his constitutional functions\"\r\nto meet us, but to our surprise this time His Excellency wrote\r\nappointing a meeting with us at noon on May 15 at Government House.\r\nBut, in the interview, the reason why that particular appointment\r\ncame within the pale of His Excellency's constitutional functions\r\nbecame apparent:  for the Governor-General only made it the opportunity\r\nto urge the deputation not to go to England.\r\n\r\nThe deputation replied that, even in native politics there was always\r\nan appeal from the action of an induna to the native chief\r\nand from the latter to the ruler; that it was straining the loyalty\r\nof the black millions of South Africa to tell them that there was no appeal\r\nto His Majesty the King against the oppressive laws of a Parliament\r\nin which they had no representatives.\r\n\r\nIt must be added that although the Governor-General did not say so,\r\nyet the barbarous cruelties of this relentless law appeared to have produced\r\na sympathy that was visible in his facial expression.  Astonishment and pity\r\nwere amongst the sensations which seemed to be depicted\r\non Lord Gladstone's face.  Still, he held out no hope that his good offices\r\nwould be used to secure an amelioration of the conditions complained of.\r\nAll His Excellency advised us to do was to abandon the appeal to England.\r\n\r\n\"But, your excellency, what about these cruelties that are now in progress?\"\r\nwe asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well,\" said Lord Gladstone, \"the Natives are not the only sufferers,\r\neven in England people have suffered hardships from time to time,\r\ntill they were compelled to emigrate to America and other places.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true, your lordship, but it is to avert such a contingency,\r\nif possible, that the Natives appointed a deputation to lay their case\r\nbefore His Majesty the King, as they have no means to emigrate to America,\r\nor any other country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" he answered, \"don't misunderstand me; I only use that\r\nas an instance, not that Natives must emigrate.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General then repeated the advice not to appeal to the Crown,\r\nbut he held out no hope of an amendment in the Act, and so the deputation\r\nsailed for England.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this interview, no less a personage than General Botha himself\r\n-- Premier and Minister for Native Affairs -- condescended to meet\r\nthe deputation.  Prior to this meeting, the deputation entertained\r\nstrong hopes that the Premier would come to it with an offer of, say, at least\r\nallowing the hiring of land by Natives, pending the report of the Commission,\r\neven though the prohibition to buy land remained in force.\r\nBut instead of such a minimum, the only hope that General Botha held out\r\nwas that he had not evicted the Natives on his own farm,\r\nand that he had further told some farmers not to evict their Natives.\r\nThese personal acts of the Premier on his own farm, and with regard to\r\nsome other farmers, had not helped the entire native population of the Union\r\nsince the Act was promulgated.  Nor would they assist those native wanderers\r\nwho are now without a home on earth, as General Botha himself\r\ncould not allow any of them to settle on his farm without breaking the law.\r\nAgain, it did not seem quite clear how General Botha's efforts\r\nin this direction could make any impression on private landowners when\r\nhis own officials were carrying out wholesale evictions of native tenants,\r\non the Government farms at Standerton and elsewhere, and sending them adrift\r\nabout the country.  The only remedy, and that a partial one,\r\nwould be to legalize the settlement of tenants who have been evicted.\r\nBut to this General Botha said, \"If I went to Parliament now\r\nwith a Bill to amend this law they will think I'm mad.\"\r\n\r\nThat statement confirmed the decision of the deputation to proceed to England,\r\nand accordingly they at once made arrangements for sailing.\r\n\r\nOne painful fact which these interviews revealed was\r\nthe ignorance of the Government in matters relating to the Natives.\r\nThe 5,000,000 blacks of the Union are taxed to maintain\r\nwhat is called the most expensive Civil Service in the world.\r\nThe officials of the Native Affairs Department, in return for\r\ntheir huge salaries, paid out of the proceeds of taxes levied from\r\nrelatively the most poorly paid manual labourers in the world,\r\nnamely, the Native taxpayers, are called \"the guardians of the Natives\";\r\nbut General Botha, the Minister of Native Affairs, \"Father of the Natives\"\r\nand supreme head of the Civil Service, seemed (or pretended)\r\nto know absolutely nothing of the manner in which his official underlings\r\nplay battledore and shuttlecock with the interests of the Native population.\r\nTo mention but one instance:  at one stage of the interview we attempted\r\nto enlist his sympathy on behalf of the \"Free\" State Natives in particular,\r\nwho, in spite of prohibitive laws in the Boer statute books,\r\nhad not to our knowledge been debarred by the Boer Government\r\nfrom buying or leasing land.  General Botha not only denied that his was\r\nthe first Boer administration which definitely enforced these prohibitions\r\nbut he also asserted, with all the dignity of his office,\r\nthat no living Native had ever bought a farm in the \"Free\" State\r\nfrom a white man -- in short he accused us of telling lies.\r\nFortunately Mr. E. Dower, who remembered that some Native landowners\r\nin both the Hoopstad and Thaba Ncho districts of the \"Free\" State\r\nhad acquired their properties from white people under the Republican regime,\r\nwas present at the interview and he then bore out our statement:\r\nthus on May 15, 1914, the Prime Minister and Minister of Native Affairs\r\nheard for the first time in his life that there were some Natives\r\nactually living in the \"Free\" State who pay him quit-rent on farms\r\nwhich they had bought from white people under Republican rule.\r\n\r\nThe assertion that \"Free\" State Natives lost nothing by the enforcement\r\nof the Natives' Land Act is but one phase of the maze of ignorance\r\nthrough which the Union Government is groping in a hopeless attempt\r\nto discharge their trust to the native taxpayers.\r\n\r\nThe co-operation of intelligent and responsible native taxpayers,\r\nwhich could sweep away these administrative cobwebs of ignorance,\r\nis always at the disposal of the Government if they deigned\r\nto avail themselves of it; but they prefer, at enormous cost\r\nto the taxpayers (including native taxpayers), to purchase\r\nfrom the non-native section of the community arm-chair views\r\nbased largely on hearsay evidence, which is often tainted by colour prejudice.\r\nHence the shroud of ignorance which surrounds the native policy\r\nof the Union of South Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI     The Appeal for Imperial Protection\r\n\r\n  Of all the characters of cruelty, I consider that as the most odious\r\n    which assumes the garb of mercy.\r\n                                       Fox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn arrival in London the native delegates were received\r\nby several friends, including Dr. Chas. Garnett, M.A.,\r\nof the Brotherhood League; Rev. Amos Burnet, of Transvaal,\r\nintroduced them to the Wesleyan Missionary Committee in session\r\nat Bishopsgate; the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society\r\ncommunicated with the Colonial Office regarding an interview.\r\nThe Colonial Secretary agreed to see the deputation on condition\r\nthat they were accompanied by no one from the Society.\r\n\r\nWhen the native deputation reached England there were\r\na number of South African missionaries on furlough in England\r\nwho had taken part in Church meetings in Africa, of protest against the Act.\r\nSome of these gentlemen had witnessed the cruel operations of the Act;\r\nbut the decision to receive the native delegates by themselves\r\nmeant that no such eyewitnesses as these could testify\r\nto what they had seen of the working of the Act.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the time fixed for the interview, the deputation\r\nduly waited upon the Secretary of State, whose reply was more fully given\r\nin Parliament.  At the interview he took notes on nothing, and asked\r\nno questions.  On every point he had \"the assurance of General Botha\"\r\nto the contrary.\r\n\r\nNo headway having been made with the Government, it was resolved upon\r\nthat the delegates should appeal to the British Parliament\r\nand thence to the British public in terms of the native mandate.\r\n\r\nLater on Messrs. T. Buxton and J. H. Harris, the secretaries\r\nof the A.S. and A.P.S., arranged a meeting for the delegates\r\nto meet certain members of Parliament.  The meeting took place\r\nin No. 11 Committee Room of the House of Commons.  The British peerage\r\nwas represented by Lords Emmott and H. Cavendish Bentinck.\r\nAfter hearing the delegates and asking them questions,\r\nthe members of Parliament intimated that their decision would be\r\narrived at later in the absence of visitors.  It must be mentioned here\r\nthat besides the above secretaries of the A.S. and A.P.S. there were also\r\npresent at this meeting a few sympathizers who were not members of Parliament.\r\nThey included Miss S. Colenso of Amersham, and the Rev. Dr. Howie of Stirling,\r\nand Mrs. Howie, etc.\r\n\r\nBy the kindness of Mr. and Mrs. Buxton, Mr. and Mrs. Cobden Unwin\r\n(in conjunction with Mrs. Saul Solomon), Lady Scott of Westminster,\r\nMrs. S. J. Colenso of Amersham, and Mr. H. E. Wood, J.P., of Camberwell\r\n(the latter being a prelude to a successful meeting of the delegates with\r\nthe Baptist Council of England), Sir Albert Spicer, M.P., and Lady Spicer,\r\nand Mr. and Mrs. Harris of Dulwich, receptions -- some of them attended\r\nby English and Colonial guests -- held at the residences of the friends named,\r\nwere given in honour of the delegates.\r\n\r\n==\r\n                            IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS\r\n\r\nMr. P. ALDEN:  I wish to bring to the notice of the right hon. Gentleman\r\nthe question of the native lands in South Africa.  I happen to have been\r\nresponsible for a Resolution passed unanimously in this House\r\nprevious to the passing of the Act of Union, and in the discussion\r\nwhich took place on that occasion the Under-Secretary of State to the Colonies\r\nlaid it down as one of the duties of the Imperial Parliament\r\nto protect in every possible way the interests of the Natives in their land,\r\nand protect their rights and liberties in that respect.\r\nIf we take away the land from the Native we take away his liberty.\r\nIn reference to the Natives Land Act of 1913, I want to put\r\ntwo or three points before the right hon. Gentleman.\r\nIn the Union of South Africa, blacks own about 4,500,000 morgen of land,\r\nand the whites own fourteen times as much land as the blacks,\r\nthough, of course, they are very much smaller in number.  The inequality\r\nis very noticeable in the Transvaal, where there are 300,000 whites\r\nholding 31,000,000 morgen of land, and the 1,000,000 Natives\r\nonly have 500,000 morgen of land which they can call their own.\r\n\r\nIt has been said over and over again in South Africa that this law\r\napplies equally to Europeans and whites as well as to the Natives.\r\nThere is, they say, no injustice.  The European is estopped\r\nfrom this purchase of land, just as the Native is estopped.\r\nAll I can say in answer to that is that the fallacy is shown\r\nthe moment you begin to ask what land the Natives have to sell.\r\nThe native areas are already overcrowded, and they positively have no land\r\nwhich they could sell.  When once a Native leaves his farm or is evicted,\r\nor has to quit for any reason whatever, the Act does not allow him\r\nto purchase, hire or to lease anywhere else for farming purposes\r\nexcept from Natives, who have not the land to lease or to sell.\r\nHe therefore must become a servant on the farm.  There is absolutely\r\nnothing else for him to do but to become a servant.  This Act has already\r\nproduced very great hardships.  It has produced hardships to the people\r\nwho were under notice to quit at the time the Act was passed,\r\nto the people who have actually since then been evicted from their farms,\r\nto the Natives who were in search of land and who are wandering about\r\nwith their families and stock and have nowhere to settle,\r\nand to the Natives who have had to leave their crops unreaped.\r\nThere are many hundreds of such cases of hardship which have been inflicted\r\nunder the Act which is being enforced on all sides.  I do not wish to go\r\ninto this question at very great length, because the right hon. Gentleman\r\nknows more about it than anybody in the House in all probability,\r\nand he knows the difficulties of the situation.\r\n\r\nI want to put before him just one point with regard to what can be done.\r\nWE CALL OURSELVES THE PROTECTORS OF THE RIGHTS OF THE NATIVES,\r\nand we claim that we have always, in season and out of season,\r\ninsisted that those rights should not be infringed, and that no action\r\nshould be taken against their liberties.  The Imperial Government cannot,\r\nof course, intervene in the sense of asking the Government of South Africa\r\neither to rescind an Act of Parliament or to amend an Act of Parliament,\r\nunless it is their own wish, but I must point out that\r\nClauses 1, 4, and 5 do operate most harshly against the Native,\r\nand it might be possible, on the representation of the right hon. Gentleman,\r\nfor the Prime Minister of South Africa to mitigate the hardships.\r\n\r\nMr. CAVE:  The subject to which the hon. Member has referred\r\nis no doubt of importance, and no one can quarrel with the tone of the speech\r\nin which he has introduced it.\r\n\r\nSir ALBERT SPICER:  I quite realize that in South Africa\r\nwe have a self-governing country, and, therefore, one would be\r\ndesirous to be very careful in what he said with regard to\r\nits administration and legislation.  But this, at any rate,\r\nis the right place to express the views that are held\r\nby very large numbers of people in this country, who have devoted\r\na good deal of time and money in doing what they can to educate and uplift\r\nthe native races of South Africa.  Those of us who know South Africa,\r\nare perfectly well aware that whilst it is now a country\r\nowned by the white races, it can only be properly and fully developed\r\nwith the help of the native races, and the better educated they are,\r\nthe better work they will be able to do for South Africa.\r\nThis Native Lands Act was passed very hurriedly.  Of course,\r\nwe cannot blame South Africa for passing legislation hastily,\r\nseeing that we are accustomed sometimes to do the same thing\r\nin the Mother of Parliaments.  Again, the appointment of the Commission,\r\nwhich is now inquiring into the subject and is taking evidence,\r\nis helping, I think, to produce injustice in some cases,\r\nso far as the Natives are concerned, because the introduction of the Lands Act\r\nhas led farmers to take action to enforce their rights.  They have terminated\r\nthe rent-paying agreements of former tenants, and, knowing that these\r\nare precluded from making new agreements for the hire of land, they have\r\neither ejected them or have demanded from them three months' unpaid service\r\nper annum, which has had the indirect effect of reducing a free people\r\nto a condition of service.  I could give instances of that\r\nfrom well authenticated sources.  I will refer to one only.\r\nIt is the case of a chief and his people living on land\r\nwhich they and their fathers have dwelt upon for eight generations.\r\nThe farm was recently purchased by a farmer resident in another province.\r\nHe decided to terminate the rent-paying conditions previously in existence\r\nbetween the former owner and the Natives, and to substitute labour conditions,\r\nunder which even the chief, an old man, has been required to give service.\r\nThe people were called upon to quit their houses, square buildings,\r\ntimbered and thatched, and in connexion with this the owner gave\r\nless than one month's notice in the following terms: --\r\n\r\n    \"This is to notify I can let you have the school building\r\n    no longer.  I bought the farm and wish to receive the same\r\n    at the end of your school quarter.\"\r\n\r\nWe desire to speak with all due respect of the self-governing Dominions\r\nof South Africa, but I think we may fairly ask the Colonial Secretary\r\nto help the Union Government to realize that there is a strong feeling\r\nin this country in favour of everything possible being done\r\nto secure just and reasonable treatment for the Natives.\r\nOne may fairly ask the right hon. Gentleman to use all reasonable influence\r\nwith the Union Government to secure for the Natives a fair quid pro quo\r\nfor the loss of their former rights of land purchase, which would mean\r\nin some cases an extension of the native area, and if it were possible\r\nto suspend to some extent the operation of the Act until the Land Commission\r\nhas reported.  Having been connected with South Africa for a good many years,\r\nhaving travelled through it, and given a good deal of time to it,\r\nI desire to do what I can for the uplifting of the people of that country,\r\nand that is my reason for intervening in this Debate.\r\n==\r\n\r\nOther sympathizers, including the Member for Woolwich,\r\nrose in different parts of the House to support the foregoing appeal,\r\nbut the Colonial Secretary stopped them by delivering his reply.\r\n\r\n==\r\nThe RT. HON. L. HARCOURT:  The hon. member for Tottenham (Mr. Alden)\r\nand the hon. Baronet the Member for Hackney (Sir A. Spicer)\r\nhave drawn attention to the South Africa Land Act.  It is not\r\na sudden inspiration of the Botha Government.  It is the outcome and result\r\nof a Commission appointed by Lord Milner some years ago,\r\npresided over by Sir Godfrey Lagden.  The Commission was appointed\r\n\r\n    \"In view of the possible federation of the South African Colonies\r\n    to gather accurate information as to native affairs so as to arrive\r\n    at a common understanding on questions of native policy.\"\r\n\r\nThat Commission sat for two years.  It had upon it representatives\r\nof every colony and territory.  It arrived at what I believe\r\nwas a unanimous (sic) report,* and this Act is practically doing no more\r\nthan carrying out its recommendations.  The Act has already been\r\nin operation for twelve months.  The Commission of Inquiry,\r\nwhich was to be instituted under the Act, is now sitting.\r\nIt is bound by the terms of its appointment to report within two years,\r\nand will probably report by Christmas next.**  The whole of this Act\r\nis a temporary measure until that Commission reports.  A native deputation\r\nhas come over and seen me, and I believe many other members.\r\nThat deputation left Africa against the advice of General Botha,\r\nand against almost the entreaties of Lord Gladstone.  They knew that the Act\r\nwould not be disallowed, because it had been announced months before\r\nin South Africa.  The day the deputation saw me the period of twelve months\r\nduring which that Act could be disallowed on my recommendation\r\nhad already expired, and it is now an act which can only be suspended\r\nby the Government and Parliament of the Union of South Africa.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* Col. Stanford (the Cape Colony representative on the Lagden Commission)\r\n  and Messrs. Campbell and Samuelson (the Natal representatives)\r\n  sent in two strongly-worded minority reports against such restrictions.\r\n  Vide S.A. Native Affairs Commission, 1903-5, Vol. I.  -- Author.\r\n** After Christmas the Commissioners' \"terms of appointment\" were altered\r\n   from two years to three years.\r\n--\r\n\r\nSir W. BYLES:  Does it forbid the holding of land by Natives?\r\n\r\nMr. HARCOURT:  Perhaps the hon. member will allow me to complete my statement\r\nas the time is short.*  The suspension of the Act would be worse than useless\r\nat the present stage.  It would suspend the Inquiry which is taking place\r\nat this moment in the interests of the Natives themselves.  I cannot believe\r\nthat any further Commission is necessary, as the existing one seems to me\r\nboth efficient and sufficient.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* Mr. Harcourt would have shortened the time considerably,\r\n  had he said \"Yes\" or \"No\", instead of replying in sixteen words.\r\n--\r\n==\r\n\r\nIt is not clear why Mr. Harcourt made this statement as the Natives,\r\nin their petition to the King, never asked for a suspension of the whole Act.\r\nAll that they wished was that the harshest clauses of the measure\r\nmight be suspended, leaving the others in operation until the Commission\r\nrendered its report.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Harcourt's reference to the Commission was made known in South Africa\r\nthe Commissioners, then sitting in Pretoria, were informed of the plight\r\nof evicted Natives.  The Commissioners replied that any grievance\r\narising out of the operation of an Act of Parliament was beyond\r\nthe scope of their enquiry, and that they could not consider such grievances.\r\nThis was exactly what they had previously told the Natives\r\nat King Williamstown and elsewhere.  At Harrismith the Commission heard\r\nthe complaint of a son of Chief Wietzie, who, during the Basuto wars,\r\nhad always remained loyal to the \"Free\" State Boers.  The son had been\r\nevicted from the ground on which he and his fellow-tribesmen\r\nhad resided for generations and he was forced to live on an urban location\r\nwhere it is impossible to do any farming.  The President\r\n(Sir William Beaumont) said he was sorry to hear that a son of Wietzie\r\nfound himself homeless, but he regretted that the Commission\r\ncould not help him.  Mr. Harcourt, therefore, must have been\r\nincorrectly informed regarding the functions of the Commission.\r\n\r\nYet another puzzle.  After the appointment of this Commission\r\nin September 1913, there was a newspaper report to the effect\r\nthat the Commission found the native difficulty most acute\r\nin the \"Free\" State, and that it had decided on setting aside without delay\r\na strip of territory in the Western \"Free\" State as a native settlement.\r\nImmediately after the appearance of this report in the Press,\r\nangry meetings of the whites were held in Boshof and Hoopstad\r\nto protest against the proposals attributed to the Commission.\r\nIn reply to these protests, Mr. Theron, the Minister of Lands,\r\nevidently speaking on behalf of the South African Government,\r\nnot only repudiated the report but he also added significantly\r\nthat \"the Government had no intention of creating a native area\r\nin Hoopstad or anywhere else.\"  So, where do we stand?  Can it be wondered\r\nthat the Natives are beginning to conclude that their position under the Union\r\nis hopeless?\r\n\r\nBut, to return to Mr. Harcourt, the Colonial Secretary also gave\r\nthe Imperial Parliament a fresh explanation of the Natives' Land Act.\r\nIt is a pity that we cannot reproduce his explanation side by side\r\nwith the four explanatory circulars issued by the Union Government in 1913.\r\nSuch a reproduction would show the discrepancy between the five explanations.\r\nWe wrote to South Africa but could only secure one of these circulars,\r\nwhich purports to be an explanation of a previous explanatory circular --\r\nan explanation of an explanation.  However, the definition of the Act,\r\nas given by the other three circulars, leaves, as far as we can remember,\r\nthe root principle of the Act unexplained.  Moreover, the statements set forth\r\nin these circulars are not in harmony; they have only one point of agreement,\r\nnamely:  that when Natives are driven out of their homes by the law,\r\nand are debarred by the same law from establishing other homes\r\n(the only provision made for them being that they should live\r\nas servants of the whites) the circumstances give them\r\nno ground for complaint.\r\n\r\nTake for instance only two sentences in Mr. Harcourt's explanation.\r\nIn the first of these, he appears to approve of the system of forced labour\r\nestablished by the Act; in the second, he denies the evictions that took place\r\nin July when he spoke, and those that took place subsequently.  He seems\r\nto flatly deny not only what is admitted by Lord Gladstone and General Botha,\r\nbut he likewise contradicts the terms of the Act itself.\r\nIndeed, if we had not been there and heard him we should have felt, on reading\r\nthis part of his speech, that he had been misreported in Hansard.  Thus --\r\n\r\n==\r\nIf the Natives are farm labourers there is no limit to the number\r\nwho may reside on white property.  If not, they are not dispossessed\r\nuntil Parliament acts upon the report of the Commissioners, and then only\r\nwhen suitable land is provided by addition to a native reserve.*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* At Downing Street Mr. Harcourt informed the Deputation\r\n  that he had the \"assurance of General Botha\" that the Natives\r\n  have too much land already.\r\n--\r\n==\r\n\r\nThe Imperial explanation being as obscure as the Colonial explanations\r\nwhich preceded it, the reader's remedy is to fall back\r\non the plain English of the Act (Chapter III), which alone has\r\nthe force of law.  Again Mr. Harcourt: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nIf General Botha breaks his word I have no power to enforce it.\r\nI cannot bind his successors.  If the Government of South Africa\r\nis not to be trusted in this matter they are to be trusted in nothing;\r\nand we know perfectly well that they can be trusted in these matters.\r\nNOTE WHAT HAS BEEN DONE WITH RESPECT TO THE INDIAN IMMIGRATION ACT.\r\nTHIS WAS PASSED NOT FROM LOCAL DESIRE, BUT FROM IMPERIAL CONSIDERATIONS.\r\nTHE PROVISIONS OF THAT ACT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE COLONISTS\r\nAND BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE INDIANS, WHO CONSIDER IT\r\nTHE MAGNA CHARTA OF THE INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA.  I think that that should be\r\na sufficient guarantee as to the way in which General Botha proposes to act.\r\nGeneral Botha, too, used THESE WORDS in Parliament: --\r\n\r\n\"He had told the deputation that he had given standing instructions\r\nto the magistrates throughout the country that if they found\r\nany one in their districts ejecting Natives from the farms\r\nthey had to go and make inquiries and report to him.  He had\r\nin all those cases which had been brought to his notice\r\nused the influence of his Department.\"\r\n==\r\n\r\nAll we can say in regard to \"these words\" is that the Magistrates\r\napparently ignored the \"standing instructions\" alluded to,\r\nfor they allowed the officials of the Department of Lands\r\nto scatter the native tenants from Government farms at Standerton,\r\nColworth and elsewhere and sent them adrift over the country,\r\nwell knowing that they could find no other shelter.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of January, 1914, the Magistrate of Ladysmith,\r\npresumably acting under instructions from one of General Botha's Departments,\r\nissued the following notice to 79 native families in his district: --\r\n\r\n==\r\n\"To Vellem Sibisi, Kraal Head residing on one of the following farms,\r\nviz. Remainder of Brakfontein, Remainder of Weltevrede, etc.,\r\n\r\n\"Take notice in terms of Section 4 of Law 41 of 1884 that you are required\r\nto remove with your Kraal and inmates from whichever of the said farms\r\nyou may be residing on, six months from this date, the aforementioned farms\r\nhaving all been purchased by Government for closer settlement purposes.\"\r\n==\r\n\r\nThe Magistrate who so ruthlessly ejected these and other native families\r\nacted under the orders of the Government, who settled white people\r\non the farms at the expense of a Treasury maintained also by native taxpayers.\r\nAnd it seems difficult to conceive how a Government which proved\r\nso indifferent regarding the fate of its own native tenants or of tenants\r\non farms freshly acquired at the public expense, could be solicitous about\r\nthe welfare of Natives evicted by private landowners.  The statement,\r\non the face of it, is incongruous.\r\n\r\nIn his heroic efforts to defend South Africa's giant wrong,\r\nMr. Harcourt gave away his case when he referred approvingly\r\nto what he calls \"the Magna Charta of the Indians in South Africa\".\r\nNow, what is this \"Magna Charta\"?  In 1913, when the South African Parliament\r\nwas at the noontide of its \"mad career\", it passed this iniquitous land law\r\nto repress the native race; and also a law imposing the most\r\nhumiliating limitations on British Indians.  Yet it must be added\r\nthat the Indian law was the milder of the two, as it did not prohibit\r\nIndian residents in South Africa from living on the land.\r\nThe Rt. Hon. A. Fischer, Union Minister of the Interior,\r\nwho died two years ago, called these two laws of 1913,\r\n\"the Kafir law and the Coolie law\".\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the London Committee of the Wesleyan Methodist Church\r\nasked to see Mr. Harcourt and inform him how drastically the \"Kafir law\"\r\nwas operating against their converts and other Natives in South Africa,\r\nbut Mr. Harcourt discreetly refused to see the Committee.\r\n\r\nAs for the Indians, no one in South Africa paid any heed to their complaints\r\nagainst the \"Coolie law\"; but their cry reached India and Lord Hardinge\r\ndemanded the redress of their grievances.  His Lordship insisted so forcibly\r\nthat (unlike the Wesleyan missionaries) he could not be ignored.\r\nThe result was that the South African Parliament, \"not from local desire,\r\nbut from Imperial consideration\", was obliged in the next session (1914)\r\nto amend the \"Coolie law\" with a \"Magna Charta of the Indians\r\nin South Africa\", and Mr. Harcourt's reference to this episode\r\nconveys the suggestion that what is sauce for the Indian goose,\r\nwith Lord Hardinge at its back, can be by no means sauce for the native gander\r\nwithout the backing of a Viceroy.\r\n\r\nWe cannot believe that to boast in one and the same speech\r\nabout a \"Magna Charta of the Indians\" and dismiss the native appeal\r\nagainst a vital wrong is true Imperialism.  For if Imperialism stands\r\nfor the protection of a few thousand Indians in South Africa because they are\r\nsupported by a Viceroy, and the neglect of the groans of five million Natives\r\nbecause (unlike a Viceroy) the missionaries who plead for them\r\ncannot enforce their claim with a political or diplomatic blow,\r\nthen there would appear to be the suggestion of more fear than justice\r\nin Imperialism.\r\n\r\nMr. Harcourt further credits the Milner Commission, presided over by\r\nSir Godfrey Lagden, with the origin of the Natives' Land Act.  We do not wish\r\nto defend the policy of these two former South African Statesmen, as we\r\nfeel certain that they can take care of themselves.  But we must say at once\r\nthat we read the recommendations of the Lagden Commission ten years ago,\r\nas carefully as we have since read the controversy of the Natives' Land Act;\r\nand with the knowledge thus gained, we can safely tell the reader\r\nthat that Commission never recommended that: --\r\n\r\n1.  \"Except with the permission of the Governor-General\", Europeans must\r\nbe debarred from buying land from Natives (who have no land to sell),\r\nand Natives must be debarred from buying land or leasing land from Europeans,\r\nwho alone deal in land.  -- (Sect. 1 of the Nat. Land Act).\r\n\r\n2.  When evicted Natives apply for the said \"permission of\r\nthe Governor-General\" they should be told that that permission\r\n\"will only be granted to a few exceptional applicants\"\r\nand that it could under no circumstances be granted to Natives\r\nin the colony in which the applicants resided (The Government's reply\r\nto the \"Free\" State wanderers).\r\n\r\n3.  The Government should always take from three to six months\r\nto deliver this refusal, during which period applicants may have\r\nalready become serfs or fled the country.  (This has been\r\nthe experience of all applicants within the writer's knowledge.)\r\n\r\n4.  There should be a fine of 100 Pounds or six months' hard labour\r\non any farmer who provides the Native with a shelter while he is waiting\r\nfor this disappointing reply to his application (Sect. 5 Nat. Land Act).\r\n\r\n5.  Native tenants to be hounded out of the Government farms\r\nlong before the segregation takes place and that white people,\r\nwho are not debarred from buying or leasing land for themselves,\r\nbe settled thereon at Government expense.  (See magisterial notice above.)\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Harcourt has been told by any one that the Lagden Commission\r\nrecommended any of these pitiless iniquities, then we are afraid\r\nthat his informer is a romancer of the superlative degree.\r\nThe Lagden report was never discussed in any South African legislature,\r\nmuch less adopted by any Parliament in South Africa; indeed, it is detested\r\nbecause it recommended a Native Franchise for South Africa\r\nlike the Maori Franchise of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nOne member of Parliament (Mr. Joynson-Hicks) said South Africa\r\nwas a Home Rule country and he wondered what would happen if after Home Rule\r\nhad been granted to Ireland some one asked the Imperial Parliament\r\nto interfere with Irish legislation.\r\n\r\nWe wonder who could have told this hon. Member that there was Home Rule\r\nin South Africa!  There used to be Home Rule in the Cape Colony alone,\r\nbut this has been swamped by the Act of Union, which has since\r\nestablished an oligarchic Government throughout the country.\r\nAnd if by Home Rule to Ireland it is intended to give the franchise\r\nto a selfish, greedy and tyrannical few; and give carte blanche\r\nto this few, telling them thereby to do what they wish\r\nwith the rest of the population of Ireland, and telling them further\r\nthat they will be accountable to nobody for any good legislation\r\nthat they might enact on the one hand, or any maladministration\r\nthat they might perform on the other hand as is the case in South Africa --\r\nif that be what is meant by Home Rule for Ireland, then God have mercy\r\non the Irish.\r\n\r\nWhen the reply of Mr. Harcourt was published in South Africa,\r\nsupporters of this cruel law bubbled over with joy concerning it.\r\nOne Dutch writer, after saying in a Dutch journal some very fine things\r\nabout Mr. Harcourt, wound up a high-sounding eulogy\r\nby congratulating South Africa on having such a good Colonial Secretary\r\nat Downing Street.  \"Had Mr. Harcourt's predecessors been like him,\"\r\nsaid this writer to his readers, \"South Africa would have been saved\r\nmany tears.\"  We doubt if Mr. Harcourt, the object of this appreciation,\r\nwould feel flattered by it if he knew that all the black victims\r\nof this cruel law, and all their European sympathizers,\r\nstood firmly by the Imperial Government and by the Colonial Government\r\nin the present struggle, while the gentleman at whose instance\r\nit was introduced in Parliament, as well as the Dutch editor of the journal\r\nalluded to, are at present (May 1915) committed for trial\r\non charges of high treason; and the proprietor of another Dutch journal,\r\nin which we read similar vaunting adulations of Mr. Harcourt, was fined\r\n60 Pounds (so his paper says) for alleged complicity in the recent rebellion.\r\nThese facts should impel the Rt. Hon. the Colonial Secretary to stop,\r\nlook round and inquire \"who's who\" among his South African admirers.\r\n\r\nTwo members of the South African Parliament -- Senator T. L. Schreiner\r\nand Mr. Wilcocks, M.L.A. -- the former an opponent and the latter\r\na supporter of the Natives' Land Act, recently discussed the Act\r\nfrom separate points of view; and both came to the conclusion that the measure\r\nwas designed to keep the blacks in subjection.  This conclusion is in harmony\r\nwith the bitter experiences of the native races since this Act was enforced.\r\nYet in the face of this unanimous testimony of different observers,\r\nMr. Harcourt equivocates behind the irrelevant \"assurances of General Botha\"\r\nabout a possible segregation, which question is not now before the country.\r\nAssurances on segregation only serve to confound the issue.\r\nIf the Beaumont commission, or its successor, should ever report\r\nthen the question of segregation may come before Parliament\r\nsome time in 1926.  The point before the country now is not segregation,\r\nbut the Natives' Land Act of 1913, which is now scattering the Natives\r\nabout the country.  That is the measure against which the Native appeals\r\nfor Imperial protection.  Not the future segregation.\r\n\r\nThe only serious objection with which Mr. Harcourt apparently was able\r\nto charge the native deputation, and one which the Natives do not deny,\r\nis that they came to England against the \"entreaties of Lord Gladstone\"\r\n(who previously had twice refused to see them), and against\r\nthe \"advice of General Botha\", by whose Cabinet the measure\r\nwas enacted and enforced.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that Mr. Harcourt did not at the same time\r\ntell the House of an authentic case where an aggrieved party\r\never sued for redress with the consent and advice of his oppressor.\r\nIn this connexion, the scope of our reading being limited,\r\nour ignorance is possibly abysmal; but it must be confessed that we have\r\nnever heard of such an interesting appellant and we are inclined to believe\r\nthat there never has been one.\r\n\r\nIf General Botha wished to tell the whole truth, instead of making\r\nvague assurances to Mr. Harcourt, he would say:  \"I foresaw all\r\nthe difficulties under which the Natives are suffering; and when Mr. Grobler\r\nproposed the summary stoppage of the sale and lease of land to Natives\r\nbefore the areas are segregated, I warned the House against this trouble,\r\nbut the Hertzogites being too much for me I had to give in.\"\r\nGen. Botha could go further and say to Mr. Harcourt:  \"If you will turn up\r\npage 579 of the South African Hansard (first column) reading from\r\nthe top of the page, you will find my warning in these words: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nUnless they went slowly and carefully, there was a danger that they might\r\ntake steps which would be unreasonable, unjust, and unfair on one section.\r\nFor that reason, he regretted the amendment proposed by General Hertzog,\r\nbecause the amendment would have bad results if it were accepted.\r\nIt would lead to an over-hasty measure of a most impracticable kind.\r\nThis House would have to demarcate exactly and immediately\r\nthose parts where the Natives would have to live, and he asked them:\r\nwas this House able to do so?  (Cries of \"No\".)  It was all very nice\r\nto talk and take a map and draw lines on it.  On the map they might be able\r\nto beacon off parts, and say, \"This is for the Natives,\"\r\nbut then, when they put their scheme into effect, they might find\r\nthat the ground of many individuals had been taken away\r\nwithout any inquiries or any investigations having been made.\r\n(Laughter, and \"Hear hear\".)  This House would expropriate\r\nthe rights of many white people, and they would meet with\r\nthe greatest opposition.  Where were they going to put these people then?\r\nIn the Transvaal, farmers certainly would not consent to this; he did not know\r\nthe people of the Free State so well, but he doubted whether they would agree.\r\n(A Free State Member:  \"No, they certainly will not.\")  Instead of taking\r\nany steps like this, they should be practical, and not land themselves\r\ninto greater difficulties than they could help.  Governments before them\r\nhad done their best.  He agreed that the squatting of Natives should be\r\nput an end to as soon as possible, but they should not lose sight of the fact\r\nthat many Governments before them had done their best to put an end\r\nto this squatting evil.  He knew well how the Transvaal Government had,\r\nyear after year, taken up this matter.  But what did they find?  Simply that\r\nwhen they had passed a Squatters Law they could only put it into operation\r\nin one small part of the country.  (Hear, hear.)  To introduce\r\nanother Bill like that would simply mean deceiving the country\r\n-- (hear, hear) -- and the Natives.  If they accepted\r\nthe proposal of the Minister of Native Affairs to appoint a Commission\r\nto investigate the various conditions prevailing throughout the country,\r\nhe thought they would be taking a step in the right direction.  (Hear, hear.)\r\nHowever, care was essential, because they must prevent causing\r\na sort of revolution through the country.  What they wanted\r\nwas a measure which would be acceptable to the white man\r\nas well as to the Native.  (Hear, hear.)\r\n==\r\n\r\nThese were General Botha's views when the Land Act was first mooted,\r\nbut in defiance of his solemn warning, the Bill, when gazetted, provided that\r\nthe eviction of native tenants should precede the Commission's inquiry;\r\nharsher and still harsher clauses were inserted in the Bill until the Act\r\nfinally embodied all the proposals brought forward by General Hertzog.\r\nThe promise to refer the Bill to a Select Committee was also broken,\r\npresumably as a result of pressure from the caucus.  The Government\r\ncould not face a Select Committee after this complete change of front\r\nas they must have known that reason was absolutely against them.\r\n\r\nIt might be asked:  How could a Minister turn round afterwards\r\nand give \"assurances\" concerning the benefits of a measure\r\nwhich he had opposed before?  To such a question we would hazard\r\nthe following explanation:  Our Prime Minister, on the one hand,\r\nis a British Privy Councillor and a General in the British Army;\r\nand, on the other hand, he is a simple Afrikander Boer,\r\nwho only speaks Dutch in Parliament and addresses English audiences\r\nthrough an interpreter.  And so in the eyes of General Botha,\r\nthe British Crown Minister, if the Natives be treated justly,\r\nas British subjects should be treated, it is right; and, again,\r\nin the eyes of General Botha, the Afrikander Boer, if the Natives be treated\r\nharshly and barbarously, that too is right.\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual to find these two natures contending against each other\r\nin one and the same person, whenever the Prime Minister\r\ndeals with native questions; then more often than not the Boer view,\r\nbeing that of his own nature, dominates the British sentiment,\r\nwhich is a fresh acquisition.\r\n\r\nHaving given above a striking extract from a speech on native policy,\r\nby the Rt. Hon. Louis Botha, Premier of British South Africa,\r\nwe will now proceed to give an extract from another declaration\r\nby General Louis Botha, the Transvaal Boer.  The Union Premier\r\nwas giving evidence before the Labour Commission in Johannesburg\r\nand this is what he then said: --\r\n\r\n==\r\n11,302.  Sir GEORGE FARRAR:  You said that you would recommend\r\nthe breaking up of Locations like Swaziland, Zululand and Basutoland\r\nand the putting of white settlers there?  General BOTHA:  I would suggest\r\nthat these countries be given up to the white people to live in. . . .\r\n\r\n11,337.  The general tenor of your remarks is that there is sufficient labour,\r\nand it only wants a little patience to wait for it, that is all?\r\nI have distinctly stated that there is a greater amount of labour\r\nthan has at present been obtained.  But there are farmers who have farms,\r\nand have no Natives living on these farms.  For these people it is difficult\r\nto obtain Natives because the Natives who are not living on the farms\r\nare in locations.  If the locations were broken up the Natives would be made\r\nto live on farms.\r\n\r\n11,338.  You suggest that we should break up such land as Basutoland,\r\nSwaziland and Zululand?  Yes, I say that such places are a source of evil.\r\nIt is building up a Kaffir kingdom in the midst of us which is not only\r\nbad for the Kaffirs themselves but is a danger in the future.*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* One of the Chiefs in these locations gave General Botha 200 bullocks\r\n  to feed his troops engaged in crushing a rebellion of white men.\r\n--\r\n\r\n11,339.  But take Zululand, for instance; there is a quarter of a million\r\npeople there.  What would you do with them if you break up their territory?\r\nThey would all live on the farms as the white people are doing now.\r\n\r\n11,340.  Oh, you want to cut up the land into farms,\r\ngive it to the white people and retain the Kaffirs on the farms?  Yes.\r\n\r\n11,343.  But what will the white people do with the Kaffirs,\r\npay them wages or charge them rent for the ground or what?\r\nMy opinion is that Kaffirs who now live in locations should work\r\nfor the white people, and the land should be exploited.  The white people\r\nwould pay them for the work they did and this would civilize them.\r\n\r\n11,344.  A nation like the Basutos you would deal with\r\nin the same way? --  Yes.\r\n\r\n11,345.  They at present occupy the land, we have had it in evidence before us\r\nto the effect that every inch of land in Basutoland is occupied and worked\r\nby the Kaffirs themselves as their own property? --  That is just\r\nmy argument . . . because there is opening for the Kaffirs there\r\nthey go and live there without doing anything.\r\n\r\n11,347.  But they do something.  They work the whole country,\r\nthey have a lot of grain? --  Yes, for themselves.\r\n\r\n11,352.  . . . I have shown you that Basutoland is fully occupied by Kaffirs,\r\nand they work it.  Do you want to apply your scheme to Basutoland? --\r\nI do not know very much about Basutoland, I have never been there personally;\r\nbut I am well acquainted with Zululand and also Swaziland,\r\nand I want to state this, that in my opinion it is not only a wrong policy,\r\nbut also dangerous policy to have large tracts of country inhabited\r\nby uncivilized races, and to keep them there on the present terms.\r\n\r\n11,353.  But these Natives lived there from time immemorial.\r\nIt was theirs before we came here.  How can we drive them off the land now,\r\nand take it for ourselves?  I think we are feeling very happy\r\nthat we drove them from Johannesburg in the olden days.\r\nThey lived in this country too just the same and the Kaffirs\r\nwho became civilized under us have improved.*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* `Transvaal Labour Commission', pp. 717-726.\r\n--\r\n==\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing extract the reader has the root principle\r\nof the Natives' Land Act in a nut-shell.  Not from hearsay \"assurances\"\r\nbut from what fell from the Premier's own lips.\r\n\r\nMr. Jacob de Villiers Roos, head of the Union Law Department (who knows more\r\nabout South African law than outsiders who have to rely on \"assurances\",)\r\nsays in his evidence given before the Select Committee on Public Accounts,\r\nFebruary 25, 1914, incidentally or accidentally: --\r\n\r\n==\r\n\"A circular was issued by our Department, at the instigation\r\nof the Native Affairs Department, asking that prosecutors\r\nunder the Natives' Land Act, before commencing prosecutions,\r\nshould refer to the Native Affairs Department as otherwise\r\nIT WAS FEARED THAT AN UPHEAVAL MIGHT RESULT.  The Transvaal Attorney-General\r\ndrew our attention to this circular and said that it was\r\nan infringement of his powers. . . .  When Mr. Beyers went away on leave\r\nMr. Greenlees was appointed Acting Attorney-General,\r\nand he first drew the attention of the Minister to it.\r\nThe Minister took no action until Mr. Beyers returned\r\nwhen the matter was again raised and then this circular was withdrawn.\"*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* S.C. 1-'14, pp. 136-137.\r\n--\r\n==\r\n\r\nNow, what, in the name of common sense, does a supposedly civilized Government\r\nwant with a law that it knows will cause \"an upheaval\"?\r\n\r\nThis Act should be abolished in the interest of the morality of the State\r\nand for the sake of the reputation of the Union Jack,\r\nbecause of the harm it does to the Natives and because its promoters\r\nhave rebelled against the Crown.  The Act has benefited no one;\r\nit has driven the Natives from the country to the cities,\r\nand has also disappointed the White Labour Party, who supported it\r\nin the belief that by its clause forcing Natives to work for white farmers\r\nit would keep the Natives away from the industrial centres.\r\n\r\nIt should be abolished in the interests of the Boers,\r\nfor it has aroused the bitterest enmity of the blacks\r\nagainst the Dutch section of his Majesty's subjects.\r\n\r\nFurther, the Act should be abolished because it has lowered the prestige\r\nof the Union Jack in the eyes of the coloured subjects of the King,\r\nwho have suffered and are still suffering untold misery under it.\r\nPerhaps nothing illustrates more clearly this changed feeling of the Natives\r\nthan the present state of things in South Africa.  Thus, if German\r\nSouth-West Africa had been annexed to the Cape before the Union, every Native,\r\nsouth of the Zambesi, would have approved of the step, whereas to-day,\r\nas a result of the Natives' Land Act, there is a different feeling extant.\r\nFor now the Natives know that annexation to the Union will mean\r\nthe elimination of the Imperial factor, and that as Capetown, like Pretoria,\r\nhas ceased to represent British ideas of fair play and justice,\r\nsuch a change would in the annexed territory establish \"Free\" State ideals\r\nunder the aegis of the Union Jack.  The Natives of the Union\r\nshudder at the possibility of the Damaras, who are now under\r\nthe harsh rule of the Germans, being placed under a self-governing Dominion\r\nin which the German rule will be accentuated by the truculent\r\n\"Free\" State ideas of ruling Natives.  And they think that\r\nin the existing state of circumstances, Portuguese or French rule would be\r\ninfinitely better for the Damaras than a Government which, although protected\r\nby the Union Jack, yet is inspired from Pretoria and Bloemfontein.\r\nAnd it is to be feared that the pernicious principles\r\nwhich Tommy Atkins is now fighting on the Continent to suppress,\r\nare going to be rigorously applied in a South-West Africa\r\nunder Burgher rule.  The prosperity of no State can afford to alienate\r\nthe sympathy of any considerable portion of its tax-payers.  And so,\r\nas 5,000,000 blacks have been alienated in their sympathies to the Union\r\nby this oppressive law, and as the Union Government is unable or unwilling\r\nto amend it, in the interest of the Union Government, no less than\r\nthe 5,000,000 blacks, outside intervention becomes a necessity.\r\n\r\nDuring three separate white men's upheavals in the last two years\r\n-- two bloody strikes and a civil war -- white revolters made frantic efforts\r\nto embroil the Union in a native rising, but the Natives very sensibly\r\nsided with the Government.  The native leaders, in order to counteract\r\nthis mischief-making, had to incur the expense of journeys by rail\r\nbesides financing their own mission to reach the scene of the would-be\r\nnative disturbance.\r\n\r\nThe time will come when these leaders will tire of spending their own money\r\nin paying fares to the Government Railways, to render free services\r\nto a Government which taxes them to pay other people lavishly\r\nfor similar work, while it does not even tender them so much\r\nas a word of thanks.\r\n\r\nInstead of the smallest recognition for our voluntary services,\r\nthe Union Government repays our loyalty by persecuting\r\nour widows and fatherless children with the cold-blooded provisions\r\nof the Natives' Land Act.  These cruelties are euphemistically described\r\nas the first step towards the segregation of white and black,\r\nbut they might more truthfully be styled the first steps\r\ntowards the extermination of the blacks.\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out, the Government promptly suspended\r\nthe inquiries of the Commission, whose report is naively alleged\r\nto be pregnant with the fruits of the millennium, but the cruel evictions\r\nunder the same law of the rebel Grobler are pursuing their course\r\nwhile the war lasts and the Union Government remains unconcerned.\r\nIt was only when a whole tribe was evicted during the war\r\nthat the Government interceded on behalf of the victims,\r\nbut then, the only extent of the intervention has been to secure\r\nexemption for the chief of the tribe alone, on the condition that\r\nHE FORCED THE REST OF HIS TRIBE TO RENDER EVERY YEAR THREE MONTHS' LABOUR\r\nTO THE LANDOWNER.  Yet these people could live happily on some other farm\r\ndid not the Government prohibit their happiness at the behest of a rebel who,\r\nat or about the time of this enthralling compromise, was conducting\r\ntreasonable operations against the Government.\r\n\r\nThe sublime ingratitude of the Union Government is wellnigh unbearable!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII    The London Press and the Natives' Land Act\r\n\r\n  Slaves cannot breathe in England:  if their lungs\r\n  Receive our air, that moment they are free;\r\n  They touch our country, and their shackles fall.\r\n                                       Cowper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe native deputation (thanks to Mr. H. Cornish, secretary of\r\nthe Institute of Journalists) can truthfully assure their people,\r\nat the present critical state of their position, of the sympathy\r\nof the London Press.  It is hardly necessary to mention\r\nthat religious papers, to which the object of the deputation was made known,\r\npublished some very encouraging articles on the same,\r\nand bespoke the deputation a cordial reception and a sympathetic hearing\r\nthroughout the United Kingdom; but the mission might have been\r\nsomewhat monotonous had we friends only and no enemies in the London Press.\r\nAnd a weekly paper with a yellow cover, called `South Africa',\r\ndid its best to fill the role of an enemy.\r\n\r\nIt abused the Brotherhood Movement and the Aborigines Protection Society for\r\ntaking up the cause of the deputation.  The General Press Cutting Association,\r\nhowever, through whom we learnt of the attacks of `South Africa',\r\ndid not tell us whether this journal also abused our other friends\r\nrepresented by the London Press.  Such has been our good fortune\r\nin this respect that friends frequently congratulated us\r\non the unanimity of the Press in our favour.  In this we think\r\nthey were right, as a cause with only one enemy could very well be depended on\r\nto take care of itself.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion some of our friends heard that the author\r\nwas going to interview the fine-fingered editor of the `Westminster Gazette'\r\nby appointment, and they strongly advised us against doing so.\r\n\"Why not?\" we asked.  \"Oh,\" said our friends, \"he edits the leading\r\nGovernment organ, and he is going to pump you of all information\r\nin order to use it against your cause and in favour of the Government.\"\r\nBut we went -- firstly, because we refused to believe\r\nthat the editor of that great organ of British thought\r\nwas capable of taking such a mean advantage of us; and secondly,\r\nbecause we were confident of being able to take care of ourselves\r\nagainst any kind of pump; and we can now say with satisfaction that,\r\non the part of the British public, there was such a demand\r\nfor back numbers of the two editions of the `Westminster Gazette'\r\nwhich contained a report of our interview and a photograph of the deputation\r\nthat in a fortnight both issues were sold out of print.  Further,\r\nit is safe to say that from the wide area from which inquirers wrote to us\r\nmentioning the `Daily News', it would seem that either that journal\r\nhas a very big circulation or its readers are mainly interested\r\nin South African Affairs.  And what, may be asked, are the qualifications\r\nof the newspaper `South Africa' which attempted to run counter\r\nto this overwhelming opinion in our favour?\r\n\r\nUnlike some of its contemporaries, `South Africa' has not\r\na single native contributor to its columns.  Some London newspapers\r\nare in regular receipt of exchange copies from native newspapers\r\npublished in South Africa, London papers which never claimed\r\na monopoly over South African thought; yet here is a paper,\r\nSouth African in title and in pretensions, which cannot even boast\r\nof a South African native paper on its exchange list!  What information, then,\r\ncan the editors of such an exclusive London paper possess\r\nabout an Act specifically enacted to operate against Natives?\r\nLogically, they would know absolutely less than next to nothing\r\nabout such a law or its fell work.  That alone should dispose of\r\nthe qualifications of this enemy of the deputation, and his authority to speak\r\non the subject of its mission.\r\n\r\nThe `African World' is an Anglo-African weekly which has\r\nnative newspaper exchanges and several African correspondents\r\nboth white and black.  Its editor-in-chief was born in South Africa\r\nand was a journalist there before he came to reside in England;\r\nand it must be admitted that a paper with such connexions\r\nis in a better position to discuss the subject from both points of view.\r\nAnd so the `African World' says:\r\n\r\n==\r\n                      THE SOUTH AFRICAN NATIVE DEPUTATION\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the South African Native Deputation\r\nnow in this country have gone about their business with decorum.\r\nThey have not pressed themselves forward unduly, and, so far,\r\nthe publicity given to them has been moderate in its tone, and the expressions\r\nby the members of the deputation have been equally moderate.\r\nOf course, their best friends discountenanced this visit, as we have noted\r\nfrom the South African Press, but it seems to be the general opinion\r\nthat even though no appeal lies under the Union Constitution\r\nto the British Crown as regards native rights, an extraordinary anomaly\r\nseems to exist in this:  That the Natives of South Africa within the Union\r\nappear to have fewer rights than those outside the Union, especially so far\r\nas an appeal to London on various matters affecting their interests\r\nis concerned.  We are aware that Mr. Harcourt treated the deputation\r\nwith the utmost discretion when he received them.  We also know\r\nthat Mr. Harcourt and General Botha are on very friendly personal relations,\r\nand under these circumstances, without wishing to dictate\r\nany action in the matter to the powers that be on both sides of the water,\r\nwe would like to join our contemporary `The Globe'.\r\n==\r\n\r\nAnd what did `The Globe' say?\r\n\r\n==\r\n                               THE NATIVE APPEAL\r\n\r\nThe complaint of the South African Natives who have laid their grievances\r\nbefore certain members of Parliament amounts in effect to a complaint\r\nthat Parliament is not Imperial.  Their grievances are real and pressing,\r\nas anybody can discover who troubles to look up the recent proceedings\r\nof the Union Parliament, but they have no constitutional means\r\nof ventilating them.  No native franchise exists in South Africa,\r\nand although certain members of the Union Senate are presumed\r\nto keep an eye on native questions their influence has proved ineffective.\r\nNo appeal exists under the Union Constitution to the Crown\r\nas regards Native rights, for although this omission was pointed out\r\nat the time the Act of Union was debated in the Imperial Parliament\r\nand was adversely commented on, no steps were taken by the Colonial Office\r\nto rectify the constitution in this respect.  We are, therefore,\r\nbrought up against the extraordinary anomaly that Natives of South Africa\r\nwithin the Union have fewer rights than those outside -- for the Basutos,\r\nwho remain under direct Imperial control, have successfully appealed to London\r\non various matters affecting their interests -- or even than\r\nthe Natives of Crown Colonies elsewhere, as the appeal of native landowners\r\non the Gold Coast against recent legislation in that territory attests.\r\nIn the latter case the appeal to the Colonial Office\r\nwas successful in modifying the offending enactments;\r\nin the far more serious grievances of the South African Natives\r\nthe Colonial Office has no constitutional title whatever.\r\nNevertheless the relations between Mr. Harcourt and General Botha\r\nin other respects are notoriously so close and confidential that we may hope\r\nthe Colonial Secretary will take the present occasion by the hand\r\nand urge upon the head of the South African Government\r\nthe wisdom of dealing with native discontents in his own proper sphere\r\nbefore he prosecutes his claim for the inclusion of the Basutos and Rhodesia\r\nin the Union -- a claim which both the black Natives and the white colonists\r\nhave repudiated with all the emphasis at their command.\r\nGeneral Botha could scarcely fail to give heed to private advice\r\nfrom the Colonial Office.  In the case of the Natal Indians, whose grievances\r\nhe recently redressed, he proved himself a man capable of taking\r\na broad and generous view of a difficult question.  There is no reason\r\nto anticipate until the contrary is proved, that he will fall below\r\nhis own level in the present not less difficult or dangerous case.\r\n==\r\n\r\n==\r\n                           VIEWS OF THE `DAILY NEWS'\r\n\r\n\"The South African National Congress, after resorting to\r\nevery constitutional means of pressing their case against the Land Act\r\non the Union Government, have sent five of their number to London\r\nin the firm conviction that the King of England, to whom they look\r\nas their natural defender and vindicator, will turn no deaf ear\r\nto their pleas.  Two of the five -- the Rev. J. L. Dube and Mr. Saul Msane --\r\nare Zulus; Dr. Rubusana is a Xosa; Mr. Mapikela, a Fingo;\r\nand Mr. Plaatje, the secretary of the National Congress, a Bechuana.\r\nAll of them are men of obvious culture and with a striking command\r\nof the English language.\"\r\n\r\n\"Having failed to make any impression on the Union Government\r\n(`If we had votes,' Dr. Rubusana observed, `we could fight our own battles')\r\nthe deputation has come to England in the hope of influencing\r\nthe Imperial Government through the Colonial Secretary.\r\n\r\n\"What they ask for is:\r\n\r\n\"First, a suspension of the operation of the Act pending the report\r\nof the Delimitation Commission:\r\n\r\n\"Second, an inquiry into native grievances under the Act; and,\r\n\r\n\"Thirdly, an assurance that the Home Government will express its concurrence\r\nwith certain promises made recently on behalf of General Botha,\r\nbut obviously depending for their value on the continuance of\r\nhis personal political supremacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Four Blacks to One White\r\n\r\n\"In carving out estates for themselves in Africa the white races have shown\r\nlittle regard for the claims of the black man,\" says the `Daily News'.\r\n\"They have appropriated his land, and in appropriating his land\r\nhave taken away his economic freedom, and have left him in a worse case\r\nthan they found him.  How the Native has been dispossessed may be illustrated\r\nby the facts in regard to the Union of South Africa.  Here the blacks,\r\nas compared with the whites, are in the proportion of four to one;\r\nbut they are in legal occupation of only one-fifteenth of the soil.\r\n\r\n\"Under the Natives' Land Act, which has brought the matter to a crisis,\r\neven the poor fragment of rights in the soil that remains seems doomed.\r\nFor under the Act the Native is denied the right -- except with\r\nthe quite illusory `approval of the Governor-General' to purchase, hire,\r\nor acquire any rights in land from a person other than a Native.\r\nUnder this provision, the Native whose tenancy expires, or who is evicted\r\nfrom a farm, is legally denied any career except that of a labourer.\r\nHe cannot own, he cannot hire, he cannot live a free man.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 A Legal Serf\r\n\r\n\"In the language of Mr. Dower, the Secretary for Native Affairs,\r\nhe must `sell his stock and go into service.'  He must accept any conditions\r\nthe white farmer chooses or the mine-owner gives, and an ingenious clause\r\nencourages the white farmer to exact unpaid service from the native tenants.\r\nIn a word, the Native is a legal serf in his own land.\r\n\r\n\"As British subjects, the deputation of Natives now in England\r\nhave appealed to the Imperial Government for protection.\r\nThey asked for its help to secure the suspension of the Act\r\nuntil the Land Commission report is before Parliament,\r\nand for machinery to inquire into and redress their grievances.\r\nThey have got no satisfaction on these points.\r\n\r\n\"It is time that Parliament gave some attention to its obligations\r\nin regard to the South African Native.  He has no vote and no friends --\r\nonly his labour, which the white man wants on the cheapest terms.\r\nAnd the white man has got this by taking his land and imposing on him\r\ntaxes that he cannot pay.  In fact, the black man is `rounded up'\r\non every side, and if, as the deputation suggest may be the case,\r\nhe is forced to acts of violence, it will not be possible to say\r\nthat he has not had abundant provocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Rights to the Soil\r\n\r\n\"There is only one principle that can be applied for his protection.\r\nIt is the principle that he has rights in his native soil.\r\nPerhaps segregation is the only remedy now, but if so\r\nthe reservations allocated to him in the Union area ought to have\r\nsome relation to his needs.  We cannot do much for him there,\r\nbut we should do what we can.\"\r\n==\r\n\r\nMr. Advocate F. A. Silva wrote to the `Daily News': --\r\n\r\n==\r\n                             AN APPEAL FOR JUSTICE\r\n\r\nSir, --  Will you please allow me space, while appreciating\r\nyour editorial of this date, to bring to the kind notice of your readers\r\nthe distinction between \"British justice as supposed to be\"\r\nand \"British justice as it is\" with regard to the subject races,\r\nespecially the black men?\r\n\r\nIf even the \"hair\" of a \"white\" British subject were to be touched in China\r\nor Japan or Turkey or Russia, the whole of the political parties of England,\r\nwith their usual patriotism, will rise to the occasion, and with one accord\r\ndemand the use of physical force against that country.\r\n\r\nBut here in South Africa, on the day the \"Act\" came into law, all agreements\r\nwith regard to land were terminated, and thousands of the Natives\r\nfound themselves ruined and homeless.  From tenants they have become serfs.\r\n\r\nIf the Imperial Parliament looks with complacency on these\r\ntyrannical proceedings of a local Parliament, then the British public\r\nshould not be surprised if the intelligent and thoughtful\r\namong the subject races of \"Britain\" consider \"British justice\"\r\nand \"Russian tyranny\" to be synonymous terms.\r\n==\r\n\r\nLet us draw attention to one more letter, by an Anglo-African\r\nto the `Daily News', which was typical of the rest: --\r\n\r\n==\r\n                            THE BLACK MAN'S BURDEN\r\n\r\nSir, --  Those of your readers who, like myself, have some\r\nfirst-hand knowledge of the Natives of South Africa, know that this grievance\r\nvoiced by the native deputation is a very real one.  That such a deputation\r\nshould have to come to England to urge such a plea is humiliating enough\r\nto them and to us.  That their plea should be urged in vain\r\nwould be disastrous to the last degree.\r\n\r\nIf the Natives' Land Act is the best thing the Union Government can do\r\nin the discharge of its responsibilities to the native tribes\r\nplaced under its care by the King, then many of us would have to revise\r\nour faith in self-government as a fit instrument of national evolution;\r\nand would, moreover, strenuously resist the ultimate incorporation\r\nof the northern territories within the Union as being infinitely worse\r\nfor the black man than even government under Chartered Company control.\r\n\r\nOne hopes that it is not yet too late for both Boer and Briton in South Africa\r\nto see that this debasement of the whole idea of self-government\r\nis to affront and discourage all in Great Britain who saw\r\nin the grant of its own political freedom to that great country\r\na healing for its many woes.  In the meantime Liberalism\r\nmust back the native deputation at all costs, and it is well\r\nthat `The Daily News and Leader' should lead the way.\r\n==\r\n\r\n==\r\n           ONE OBJECT OF THE S.A. WAR:  THE LIBERATION OF THE NATIVE\r\n\r\nOne object of the South African War was to liberate the Native\r\nin the Transvaal.  One result of it is that we have practically\r\nless opportunity to interfere in his behalf than we had\r\nunder the Convention with the South African Republic.  Interference in\r\nthe internal affairs of a self-governing colony -- in this case a colony\r\nin which a small number of white men govern a large number of black --\r\nhas ceased to be within the realm of practical politics.\r\nBut if this political interference is impossible, moral remonstrance\r\nis all the more in point.  There is in all parts of the world\r\na better and more enlightened as well as a duller and more callous\r\npublic opinion, and the better opinion of a colony is powerfully reinforced\r\nby judicious expression of feeling in the mother country.\r\nThere are occasions when that opinion should even be formally expressed\r\nby the Colonial Office or by a resolution of the House of Commons.\r\nNow, there is at present a deputation of South African Natives in this country\r\nappealing against the ratification of the Natives' Land Act of 1913.\r\nMr. Harcourt has told them that he cannot interfere, nor can he\r\nany more than if he were an ornamental registering clerk.\r\nBut he can if he chooses speak winged words to the South African Government,\r\nwhich, having alienated the entire white working population,\r\nis now exciting the same hostility among the blacks.\r\nThe Act itself probably has a deeper motive.  It prevents\r\nthe sale of white men's land to the Natives or native land to the white men.\r\nThis would have the effect of securing to the Native\r\nthat very small portion of his own country which he has still managed\r\nto retain.  This probably commended the measure to those\r\nwho because they care for elementary justice are called negrophile,\r\nthe colour of justice in a white man's eyes being apparently black.\r\nThe other effect would be to prevent those Kafirs who are\r\nbecoming educated and rising in the social scale from acquiring land.\r\nAs in proportion to population the white man has by far the greater\r\namount of land, it is clear that he does not come badly out of the bargain.\r\nHowever, it is not the Act itself of which the most serious complaint is made.\r\nWhat makes matters worse is the interim arrangement that\r\npending the delimitation of native land by a Commission\r\nno Native whose lease of land has expired shall be able to renew it\r\nfor a money rent or for any consideration whatever except labour service.\r\nIt is contended that farmers are taking advantage of this prohibition to exact\r\nunpaid labour services from Natives, and are thus in effect reducing them\r\nto serfdom.  It is clear that the position in which the Native is placed\r\nrenders this only too possible, and it is an extraordinary thing\r\nthat any such violent alteration of status should be made\r\nbefore instead of after the report of a Commission.  For our part\r\nwe cannot believe that men like Generals Botha and Smuts deliberately desire\r\nto reduce the Native to the condition of a semi-servile, landless labourer,\r\nand we would venture on behalf of the many Liberals who fought steadily\r\nfor the right of South Africa to govern herself to appeal to them\r\nto extend a similar consideration to the people of whose destinies\r\nthey have become responsible, and to suspend the operation of the Act\r\nuntil the administrative preparations for carrying it out with equity\r\nhave been completed.  -- `Manchester Guardian'.\r\n==\r\n\r\n==\r\n                              VIEWS OF THE \"STAR\"\r\n\r\nWe have always realized that one of the gravest problems of self-government\r\nin South Africa is the native question.  On the one hand,\r\nSouth African Colonial opinion -- by which is meant \"white\" opinion --\r\nwill bitterly resent any shadow of dictation from Downing Street;\r\non the other hand, the conscience of the British people cannot remain\r\nindifferent to any flagrant oppression of or injustice to the native races\r\nunder the British flag.  A very difficult question of this kind\r\nis raised by the deputation of South African Natives,\r\nwhich is now in this country, seeking to move the Colonial Office\r\non the subject of the Natives' Land Act recently passed by General Botha.\r\nThe ultimate object of General Botha's plan is the greatest exodus\r\nsince the days of Moses; it is apparently to get rid of black landholders\r\nin areas in which the majority of the landowners are white,\r\nand to buy up tracts of land elsewhere from white landowners, in order\r\nto settle Natives upon them.  In this way the black and the white races,\r\nso far as landholding is concerned, will be segregated into separate areas,\r\nwith a reduction of possible cause of friction, and in some respects\r\nthis is an excellent policy.  But the trouble is that General Botha\r\nhas passed the first part of his policy and has left the second part\r\nto the future.  The Land Act provides that hereafter,\r\n\"except with the approval of the Governor-General\" -- which proviso\r\nis mere leather and prunella -- a Native shall not buy or hire any land\r\nfrom a person other than a Native.  The effect of this is that\r\nat the termination of any existing tenancy a Native will have\r\nto relinquish his farm, and will not be able to hire or buy another\r\nfrom any white owner.  If the Government had provided farms\r\nin the proposed native reserves for these men, their policy would be complete,\r\nbut nothing has been done, and the fulfilment of that promise depends upon\r\nGeneral Botha's continuance in office, and does not bind his successors.\r\nIt is not surprising the South African Natives regard this Act\r\nas a means of driving them into the labour market either at the mines,\r\nor for white farmers.  Mr. Dower, the Secretary for Native Affairs,\r\naddressing a meeting of Natives at Thaba Nchu, in the Free State,\r\ngave a strong hint of this when he said:  \"My best advice to you\r\nis to sell your stock and go into service.\"  Here at home we hear a great deal\r\nabout the \"magic of property\" and the importance of giving the worker\r\nan interest in the soil he tills; but in South Africa they apparently agree\r\nwith the southerner in the `Biglow Papers' that\r\n\r\n    Libbaty's a kind o' thing\r\n    Thet don't agree with niggers.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that it is the duty of the Colonial Office to guarantee,\r\nin conjunction with the South African Government, the carrying out\r\nof the full policy as outlined by General Botha, and we hope\r\noccasion will be taken to urge action on these lines.  -- `Star'.\r\n==\r\n\r\n==\r\n                          CAN BRITAIN PREVENT SLAVERY\r\n\r\nA question of great importance and a question which may easily strain\r\nthe links that bind the various parts of the Empire and the Mother Country,\r\nhas arisen in South Africa owing to the operation of the Natives' Land Act\r\npassed last year by the Union Parliament.  The Native question is by far\r\nthe greatest problem South Africa has to solve, and its difficulties\r\nare so great that nobody has been able to advance any feasible scheme\r\nfor its settlement, though there have been many suggestions\r\nas to the broad lines on which the matter may be settled.\r\nThe Land Act is an attempt to establish modified segregation --\r\ni.e., confining the white man and the black to separate areas of the country.\r\nIt is by no means a well-thought-out nor a very practicable enactment,\r\nand unfortunately has had the effect of greatly irritating the Natives\r\nthroughout the Union.  The Natives do not think they are being treated fairly,\r\nand have used every legitimate means to obtain a hearing.\r\nThese means, however, are exceedingly meagre, practically non-existent,\r\nsince they have no one to represent them, and as they have no vote\r\nthey can bring no pressure on Parliament.  Having failed in South Africa,\r\nthey have sent a deputation to Great Britain, since, as they are\r\nBritish subjects, they consider that Great Britain should look after them.\r\nArriving here, they find the Home Government cannot interfere\r\nin the internal policy of a self-governing colony, and so are left\r\nwith no means of obtaining redress.  It is surely impossible to admit\r\nthat Great Britain can do nothing for the mass of the native population,\r\nalthough at the moment it appears to them that though\r\nthey are subjects of the King he cannot even hear their appeal,\r\nand will do nothing for them, and has abandoned them, a state of affairs\r\nwhich is quite incomprehensible to them and leads them to depend\r\nsolely on themselves to obtain redress -- and that way rebellion lies.\r\nBritain is in an awkward position as she still has obligations\r\nto secure justice to the Natives.  If South Africa were to enact slavery,\r\nwould Britain still be able to do nothing to prevent it?\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Ousting the Native\r\n\r\nSurely Mr. Harcourt can suggest to the South African Government\r\nthe necessity of appointing a Commission to inquire into\r\nthe working of the Act, a Commission which would include Natives\r\nas well as whites.  That the Natives have a material grievance is certain.\r\nThe Act says that there shall be certain areas in which no Native\r\ncan own or lease land, and similarly areas in which no white\r\ncan own or lease land.  That within a certain period the Natives owning land\r\nin the white area must sell out, and when their leases run out\r\nthey shall not be renewed, similarly for the whites in the black area.\r\nNow at present no black area has been delimited, and the Commission\r\nperforming this task will not report for a year or more;\r\nmeanwhile the blacks are being turned off the land and have nowhere to go.\r\nThe only course left to them is to hire themselves out as servants\r\nto the white; and, in fact, that is the real object of the Act.\r\nThe farmers found that the Natives were acquiring land rapidly,\r\nand working for themselves rather than for the white man.\r\nThere was a shortage of labour, and farmers wished to force the Natives\r\nto work for them rather than for themselves.  This ejection\r\nwith no other alternative is obviously most unfair, especially as\r\nthere are indications that the native areas will not be delimited\r\nfor a considerable time.  The South Africans have always feared\r\na combined action of all the native tribes, but surely by this Act\r\nthey have chosen the simplest way of irritating every Native in South Africa.\r\nThis condition of affairs is exceedingly grave, and, though the results\r\nare suppressed at present, there is no knowing what may happen\r\nif the British Government, whom the Natives regard as their final\r\ncourt of appeal, shows itself powerless.  We know that the native question\r\nin South Africa is terribly difficult, but it is an obvious course\r\nto be pursued in order to maintain good relations between the two races\r\nthat grievances should be fairly heard and dealt with justly.\r\n-- `Review of Reviews'.\r\n==\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII   The P.S.A. and Brotherhoods\r\n\r\n  The Brotherhood must help not only the spiritual part of life,\r\n    but also in social matters.  They should always help the down-trodden,\r\n    showing the brotherly feeling which was portrayed throughout\r\n    the life of Christ.\r\n                                       Rt. Hon. A. Henderson, M.P.,\r\n                President of the Brotherhood Movement, at Weston-super-Mare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter we mentioned a yellow-covered newspaper which\r\nabused our English friends for supporting the appeal of the native deputation.\r\nIt characterized the advocacy of the aims of the deputation by the Brotherhood\r\nas \"Rubbish -- a commodity which can always be picked up,\r\nand quite a lot of people spend much of their time in collecting it.\"\r\n\"Why,\" exclaims this paper with indignation, \"we had imagined\r\nthat the `Brotherhood' movement was of a religious nature.\"\r\n\r\nOur answer to this taunt is, that just because the Brotherhood movement\r\nopposes the Natives' Land Act it must be religious,\r\nfor Anglican Bishops in South Africa have denounced this law\r\nin their episcopal charges (vide `Church Chronicle', 1913, October issues),\r\nand Anglican Bishops in South Africa are nothing if they are not religious.\r\nNonconformist Ministers have condemned this law in their annual\r\nsynods and conferences.  Ex-Premier W. P. Schreiner, K.C., C.M.G.,\r\nat present the London representative of the Union of South Africa,\r\nis the son of an old South African missionary.  He was member of\r\nthe Union Parliament when this law was passed and was one of the few senators\r\nwho had the pluck to vote against it after condemning it;\r\nand it is monstrous to suggest that these pious and learned men\r\ncould conspire to denounce a law just for the pleasure of denouncing it.\r\nAnd to our untutored mind it seems that if it be true that all these good men\r\nare working for the spread of Christ's Kingdom in South Africa,\r\nthen we must be pardoned the inference that in the same country\r\nprotagonists of this Act are working for the establishment of another kingdom.\r\nThis inference grows into a belief when it is recalled that the men\r\nwho are responsible for the recent commotion are the very men\r\nwho forced this law upon the Government.\r\n\r\nIn the various reports of the South African Church Synods of 1915,\r\nthe character of this \"Church closing\" law stands out in bold relief,\r\nand it is there revealed as an opponent of Christ and His work.  Let us refer\r\nto only one of them.  \"The native work of the (Transvaal) District\r\nhas been seriously hampered by the operation of the Natives' Land Act.\r\nAs the result of evictions under the Act, some of the Churches on farms\r\nhave ceased to exist.\"  -- Cape `Methodist Churchman', Jan. 22, 1915.\r\n\r\nThe numerous South African opponents of this law had no share\r\nin the recent upheaval, and the Brotherhoods by lending their platforms\r\nto a campaign in opposition to a law that emanates from such a quarter\r\nshow that their cause, in addition to religion, is on the side of law,\r\norder, and constitutional liberty.  We know, of course,\r\nthat no doctrine of liberty would be acceptable in South Africa\r\nthat did not also imply \"liberty to ill-treat the blacks\".\r\nHence the Brotherhood propaganda, being colour-blind,\r\nexplains the fury of the London mouthpiece of \"lily-white\" South Africa.\r\n\r\nEarly in July the deputation called at the Brotherhood headquarters\r\nin Norfolk Street, Strand, to explain to the National Brotherhood Council\r\nthe object of their mission.  Mr. William Ward, the national secretary,\r\nreceived the deputation in person; Mr. John McIntosh, secretary to\r\nthe London Federation, Mr. W. Mann and other officers being also present.\r\nThey invited the deputation to the Quarterly Meeting of the London Federation\r\nat Bishopsgate on July 14, 1914, after which the deputation received\r\ninvitations to address meetings in various parts.  Some of these engagements\r\nstill remain unfulfilled.  A list of the centres visited is given\r\nat the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\nAt the Bishopsgate gathering Mr. Will Crooks, M.P., was the \"star turn\".\r\nHe welcomed the deputation and regretted the cold reception accorded to it\r\nby the Colonial Secretary.  He added, however, that if they proceeded\r\nalong the same moderate lines followed by Dr. Rubusana and Mr. Msane\r\n(the two members of the deputation who spoke that evening)\r\nhe felt certain that they would do more good for their cause in the country\r\nthan they did at the Colonial Office.\r\n\r\nThe `Brotherhood Journal', the newspaper organ of the movement said: --\r\n\r\n==\r\n                         Bear ye one another's Burdens\r\n\r\nFor Brotherhood men and women there can be only one response to their appeal.\r\nFor Brotherhood is not only between man and man, but between\r\nnation and nation, and race and race.\r\n\r\nIn our movement, at any rate, there can be no colour bar to love and justice.\r\nIf our Brotherhoods did not rise to a cause like this, we might well question\r\nthe reality of their fraternal pretensions.\r\n\r\nWe are told that the problem has its difficulties.  No doubt.\r\nBut they can be overcome, if only our statesmen will act\r\nin a spirit of courage and faith.  Surely empire means not only\r\nprivilege and power and glory, but also responsibility and obligations.\r\nIf it means only commercial profit, and injustice is to be done with impunity\r\nunder the Imperial flag,\r\n\r\n                       Of what worth is such an Empire?\r\n\r\nThis is a matter in which every one of our members should exert\r\nthe force of opinion on the side of right.  Let us open\r\nto our coloured brothers' cause our platforms and our hearts.\r\n\r\nThe five members of the deputation will be in this country for some months,\r\nand are prepared to address Brotherhoods and Sisterhoods,\r\nand to send information as to their case to any who wish it.\r\n\r\nWe doubt not that they will find in our midst not only\r\na most sympathetic hearing, but active help in educating public opinion\r\nin this country, in order that a great wrong may be righted.\r\n==\r\n\r\nHow unlike so many poor attempts at brotherhood, organized in\r\nthe name of Christianity, especially in our part of the globe,\r\nwhere \"they have made the welkin ring with the sorrowful tale\r\nof the unfortunate condition of the weak, but, like the rich man\r\nin the parable, they liked their Lazarus afar off,\" and considered their\r\nfraternal pretensions satisfied if they sent their dogs to lick his wounds.\r\nNo, the Brotherhood movement is no such parody.  It is practical Christianity\r\nwhich knows no distinction of colour or boundaries between nations.\r\nOur nine months' association with Brother Martin and Brother Timberlake,\r\nof the Shernhall Brotherhood, confirms this view; and our acquaintanceship\r\nwith other members of this wonderful movement (which counts\r\njudges and members of Parliament as well as factory hands\r\namong its office-bearers) satisfied the writer that they are always ready\r\nto practise what they preach.\r\n\r\nA noteworthy occasion in connexion with the campaign was our visit\r\nto the Southall Brotherhood on Sunday, March 14.  We can hardly\r\nforget the day; it was on Crocus Sunday when thousands of Londoners\r\nwent to Hampton Court in crowds to see the crocus bulbs in bloom.\r\nIt was a glorious day and we remember it as the second day in 1915 on which\r\nthe European sun shone through a cloudless sky from sunrise to sunset.\r\nThousands of people attended at Hyde Park to witness the church parade,\r\nand still more thousands took advantage of the glorious spring day\r\nafter a strenuous winter to flock to Epping Forest and other popular resorts.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we took part in an Imperial indoor demonstration\r\norganized by the \"Southall Men's Own\" at the Central Hall.\r\nMr. William Cross of Hanwell represented England; Mr. T. Owens, F.C.I.S.,\r\nrepresented Wales; Mr. S. S. A. Cambridge, a black barrister,\r\nrepresented his homeland, British Guiana; Miss Ruth Bucknall, the celebrated\r\nlyric soprano, who artistically contributed the solos, represented Australia;\r\nwhile Scotland and the Emerald Isle were also represented\r\nin the orchestra and elsewhere in the hall; Mr. and Mrs. Lionel Boote,\r\nof Auckland, New Zealand, represented \"the most English of the Colonies\"\r\n(unfortunately the Indian representative could not reach Southall in time),\r\nand the writer represented South Africa, the baby member\r\nof the British family.\r\n\r\nAmong such intellectual giants, one was inclined at the outset\r\nto feel somewhat out of place, but thanks to the encouraging Brotherhood cheer\r\nwhich always accompany their reception of a speaker, the stripling\r\nsoon finds himself at home, as is always the case on any Brotherhood platform,\r\nand that was how we felt that day.\r\n\r\nMr. W. Cross said, in part, that one of the most striking proofs\r\nof the unity of the Empire was shown in the splendid way\r\nthat men had come forward to assist the Mother Country\r\non the battlefields of Europe from all parts of our Dominions.\r\nThe coloured men from India had come as free men and fellow-subjects\r\nto do their share.  The Empire was composed of territories and people --\r\nonce separated by race and creed, now united under one flag.\r\nThere was a great resemblance between Brotherhood and Empire.\r\nIn it all kinds of religion were represented, yet all were united\r\nin one great principle.  It had been said the soul of Russia was pity,\r\nof France reason, and of Britain justice.  No Empire could be built to stand\r\nunless based on justice and freedom.  The principle of freedom underlay Empire\r\nas it underlay Brotherhood also.  There was no limit to the Empire\r\nthat was founded upon unity, toleration, justice, and liberty;\r\nit surely had no end.  Similarly there was no frontier\r\nto the kingdom of Brotherhood, and they looked for a kingdom out-spanning\r\nfar beyond the roll of British drums -- the kingdom of Brotherhood --\r\nthe kingdom of Christ.\r\n\r\nReferring to the limitations of colour in South Africa, Mr. Cambridge said:\r\n\"Have you no cattle and sheep in South Africa?  Are there no birds?\r\nHave you not observed that they are of different colours and yet are not\r\nrestricted in their flight on that account; and are you going to run counter\r\nto the work of nature in regard to human beings?  The British Empire\r\nhas a population of over 430,000,000, of which less than 100,000,000\r\nare white, and there was a big problem to solve:  `How to rule\r\nwith justice and equity this great multitude of various races and creeds\r\nand consolidate them as fellow-subjects of one great and mighty Empire.'\r\nThe future of the British Empire could be secured by following\r\nthe high ideals of `Brotherhood' which were foreshadowed by Christ\r\nin the Bible, and by great writers such as Shakespeare and Addison.\r\nThe fall of Rome was due to her failure to recognize the duty\r\nof welding her subjects together as brothers one and all\r\nunder the Fatherhood of God. . . .\"\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that the argument used by Mr. Cambridge would not go down\r\nwith the majority of the rulers in South Africa.  If it did\r\none would remind them that even South African ladies pay\r\nhigher prices for black silks than they do for white silks;\r\nthat the value of domestic animals does not as a whole appear\r\nto be influenced by their colour:  thus, whereas the fleece of white sheep\r\ncommands a higher price in the South African wool market\r\nthan the fleece of black sheep, their mutton has about the same flavour.\r\nAgain of horned cattle, which give the same quality of beef,\r\nirrespective of colour; farmers will tell you of them\r\nthat coloured cattle are among the best for farming and other purposes,\r\nwhile white bullocks are subject to sore eyes, and white cows\r\ncontinually suffer from erythema of the nipples (`Garget-mammitis');\r\nyet we have not heard that this peculiarity had any influence\r\non the quality of their beef or the quality of the milk they give.\r\nThe springbuck, whence the best South African venison is obtained,\r\nhas the colours of black, white and brown; and this blend has not prevented it\r\nfrom having the reputation of being the prettiest and most graceful antelope\r\nin the world.  But argument in this respect is simply wasted\r\non the ruling caste in South Africa:  there, Mr. Cross's views\r\nabout \"freedom, liberty,\" etc., will simply be laughed out of court,\r\nunless he limits them to white men; so that one sometimes wonders\r\nwhether Christ's metaphor about \"casting pearls before swine\" does not find\r\nan application here.  Look at the weighty arguments delivered\r\ninside and outside Parliament against the Natives' Land Act.\r\nSurely no legislature with a sense of responsibility could have\r\npassed that law after hearing arguments of such force and weight against it;\r\nbut the South African legislature passed that Act and seems to glory\r\nin the wretched result of its operation.\r\n\r\nMr. Boote expressed his pride in finding how shining was the native policy\r\nof New Zealand when contrasted with the native policy of South Africa.\r\n\"Why,\" said Mrs. Boote to us, with evident satisfaction,\r\n\"we have got Maori members of Parliament and our country\r\nis all the better for it.\"  She had every justification to look pleased\r\nat the comparison which reveals the justice of her country's rule,\r\nfor we remember how the women of New Zealand got the vote.\r\nThe white members of Parliament in New Zealand were equally divided\r\non the Women's Enfranchisement Bill; but for the native members,\r\nthere would have been a tie, as was the case in South Africa three years ago,\r\nwhen the white members of the South African Parliament,\r\nas seemed likely there, wheedled the Women's Suffrage Bill out of the House.\r\nHappily for Women's Franchise in the Antipodes the Maori members\r\nvoted solidly for the Bill and secured the passage of a reform which,\r\njudging by the satisfactory results in Australia and elsewhere,\r\ngave the lead to the rest of the Empire.\r\n\r\nIt was at Hammersmith, where the chairman after hearing\r\nour story of the operation of the Natives' Land Act,\r\nin moving a resolution, in a sympathetic speech, asked:  \"Why did we\r\nspend 240,000,000 Pounds and kill 10,000 men in the South African War\r\nif this is the result?\"  He asked the permission of the audience to change\r\nthe last hymn on the programme and sing the Brotherhood Song of Liberty.\r\n\r\nAs the newspaper `South Africa' seems to insinuate that\r\nthe Brotherhood movement by allying itself with our cause\r\nhad deviated from its aims and objects, we would explain that the chairman\r\ndid not run out of the meeting to borrow a book from somewhere\r\ncontaining that song.  The song is No. 26 of the `Fellowship Hymnal' --\r\nthe hymn-book of the P.S.A. and Brotherhoods.\r\n\r\nAt subsequent meetings it had often been our pleasure,\r\nafter delivering the message from the South African Natives,\r\nto sit down and hear the chairman give out that hymn,\r\nand the orchestra lead off with the tune of Costa's March of the Israelites.\r\nA pleasant variety was lent to it at the Victoria Brotherhood\r\nin Monmouthshire, which we visited on the first Sunday in 1915.\r\nThere the chairman gave out the now familiar hymn, and the grand organ chimed\r\nthe more familiar tune of \"Jesu, lover of my soul\" (Hollingside's),\r\nand the variety lent extra freshness to the singing of\r\nthe Brotherhood Song of Liberty, which is reproduced: --\r\n\r\n    Men whose boast it is that ye\r\n    Come of fathers brave and free,\r\n    If there breathe on earth a slave,\r\n    Are ye truly free and brave?\r\n    If ye do not feel the chain\r\n    When it works a brother's pain,\r\n    Are ye not base slaves indeed --\r\n    Slaves unworthy to be freed?\r\n\r\n    Is true freedom but to break\r\n    Fetters for our own dear sake,\r\n    And with leathern hearts forget\r\n    That we owe mankind a debt?\r\n    No! true freedom is to share\r\n    All the chains our brothers wear,\r\n    And with heart and hand to be\r\n    Earnest to make others free.\r\n\r\n    They are slaves who fear to speak\r\n    For the fallen and the weak;\r\n    They are slaves who will not choose\r\n    Hatred, scoffing, and abuse,\r\n    Rather than in silence shrink\r\n    From the truth they needs must think:\r\n    They are slaves who dare not be\r\n    In the right with two or three.\r\n\r\n                                       J.

Naturally, this message was treated with the contempt\r\nthat a Boer would habitually treat any frankness on the part of a \"Kafir\",\r\nand the Boers, in utter disregard of this warning, invaded Bakhatla territory.\r\nChief Lentsue was not in a position to attack the Boers\r\nat the beginning of the invasion.  He had the men but hardly enough ammunition\r\nto last for a whole day, so he had to bide his time, scheming the while\r\nto secure an arsenal.  The Dutch contempt for Lentsue's threats\r\nadvanced by 100 per cent when they overran his outer villages on two occasions\r\nand he failed to offer any resistance, but they had not calculated\r\nthat his Intelligence Department and War Office were hard at work\r\nin order that his threat to the Boers might not come to naught.\r\nAccordingly on a certain day a convoy of huge buck-wagons,\r\neach drawn by sixteen African bullocks, carrying ammunition\r\nto the Dutch troops in Bechuanaland, meandered its way slowly\r\nin the direction of the Marico River, escorted by a squadron\r\nof mounted Burghers.  All of a sudden they were surprised and disconcerted\r\nby a fusillade of musketry, and the situation grew in gravity\r\nfrom the fact that whichever way the members of the convoy scampered,\r\nthey appeared to be running from the frying-pan into the fire.\r\nThe ruse was swift and successful, indeed so successful\r\nthat the train of ammunition and provision wagons proceeded on its way\r\nto Lentsue's town, Mochudi, but under a different escort.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened was this:  The sub-chief Segale, who has since\r\nbeen known as Lentsue's fighting general, had closely watched\r\nthe movements of the Dutch and studied their plans, till he was able\r\nto anticipate the coming of this convoy and to waylay it.\r\nHe captured enough ammunition in this and succeeding attacks\r\nto enable the Chief Lentsue to arm his men.  Thus they repulsed\r\ntwo invasions of the Boers, followed the enemy into his territory,\r\nand came home with numbers of head of cattle, and Lentsue's territory\r\nwas never again invaded by the Boers.\r\n\r\nThis isolated action of the Bakhatla Chief and people\r\nin a remote corner of the Empire, on the boundaries of the late Boer Republic,\r\nhad its moral and material value.  The Boers, who virtually owned\r\nthe whole of Bechuanaland to the south, except Mafeking town,\r\nfound that it would pay them better to adopt a friendlier attitude\r\ntowards the other Bechuana tribes.  Thereby a Dutch Field Cornet\r\npronounced all the Bechuana Chiefs as the original Afrikanders --\r\nwith the exception of Lentsue of the Bakhatla, and Montsioa of the Barolong\r\nin Mafeking.  These two chiefs, the Field Cornet said,\r\nwere traitors to their country as they had joined the foreign Rooineks\r\nagainst their black and white fellow Afrikander.  But the armed Burghers\r\nceased to help themselves to native property, and the Government's\r\nhuge compensation bill at the end of the War became less formidable\r\nin consequence.  Furthermore, the task of that unacknowledged hero\r\n-- the native dispatch runner -- became so appreciably easier that\r\nan almost regular bi-weekly communication was maintained between headquarters\r\nat the Cape and the siege garrison at Mafeking, for the native runners\r\nafter crawling through the lines of the investing Boers,\r\nunder cover of the night, could move through the peasant villages\r\nwith much less danger of detection by Boer patrols.\r\n\r\nBut it must be confessed that Chief Lentsue's defensive activities\r\nwere wholly illegal, inasmuch as the Boers, although they had declared war\r\nagainst Lentsue's sovereign Lady, Queen Victoria, were not at war with him.\r\nIt was defined, by an uncanny white man's mode of reasoning,\r\nthat the war was a white man's business in which the blacks\r\nshould take no part beyond merely suffering its effects.  The Natives' retort\r\nto this declaration was in the words of a Sechuana proverb,\r\nviz., \"You cannot sever the jawbones from the head and expect to keep\r\nthose parts alive separately.\"  It was this principle, we presume, that guided\r\nLentsue's action.  Still from the standpoint of white South Africa,\r\nthe Chief's operations were a purely filibustering adventure;\r\nand while it seemed difficult to indict Lentsue on any definite charge,\r\nsome of his men were arrested for having taken part\r\nin a cattle-raiding expedition in Transvaal in the course of which\r\nthey shot and killed a German subject of the Transvaal Republic.\r\nThese men were tried at Pretoria after peace was declared,\r\nand three of them were sentenced to death.  All through the trial\r\nthe Chief stood by his men, who pleaded justification.  He accompanied them\r\nin the first instance to Pretoria, and afterwards paid for their defence\r\nat the trial, and it was evident that he took the verdict and sentence\r\nvery much to heart.\r\n\r\nIf the verdict strained the loyalty of the Bakhatla,\r\nit had the effect of satisfying the Boers across the Bechuana border,\r\nin the Western Transvaal, who had to live down the sad memory of a victory\r\ngained by a black chief over their white army and of their purposes thereby.\r\nFrom a Dutch point of view nothing could be more humiliating\r\nthan that black men should have gained such a signal success over them,\r\nand they are constantly crying out for the repression of Lentsue\r\nand his \"proud\" Kafirs.  The Boers' demand that the Union authorities\r\nshould make the thraldom of the Natives more effective,\r\nforgetting that the armed forces of the Boers when left to themselves\r\nduring the temporary British evacuation of Bechuanaland were unable to do it.\r\nNotwithstanding this fact, the newspapers, especially the Rand Sunday Press,\r\nseem always to have open spaces for rancorous appeals to colour prejudice,\r\nperhaps because such appeals, despite their inherent danger,\r\nsuit the colonial taste.  Preceding the introduction of the Natives' Land Act,\r\nthe clamour of a section of the colonists and most of the Transvaal Boers\r\nfor more restrictive measures towards the blacks was accompanied\r\nat one of its stages by alarming reports of \"Native disaffection\",\r\n\"Bakhatla insolence\", and similar inflammatory headlines.  One Sunday morning\r\nit was actually announced in the Sunday Press of Johannesburg\r\nthat the Bakhatla had actually opened fire on the Union Police\r\nand were the first to draw blood.  Our own inquiries proved\r\nthat the British Protectorate, in and around Lentsue's territory,\r\nwhere the Bakhatla dwell, was abnormally quiet.  All that had happened\r\nwas that two Dutch policemen had unlawfully crossed into Bechuanaland\r\nwith firearms; that the Natives had disarmed them and taken them\r\nto their chief, who in turn handed them over to the British authorities\r\nat Gaberones, where they were tried and sentenced.\r\n\r\nIt is not suggested that Sunday papers in giving publicity\r\nto disturbing reports lend their space to what they know to be untrue;\r\nbut the fact remains that, right or wrong, their editorials seem ever ready\r\nto fan the glowing embers of colour prejudice into a blaze;\r\nand after arousing in this manner a most acute race feeling,\r\nthe editors, upon discovering their mistake, if such it was,\r\ndid not even trouble to tell their readers that they had unwittingly published\r\nexaggerated accounts -- since after a fair trial before the British tribunal\r\nat Gaberones, the offending Union Police were fined 50 Pounds.\r\nThe fact is that while under the quasi-Republican laws of the Transvaal\r\na native policeman dare not lay his \"black hands\" on a \"lily-white\" criminal,\r\neven if he caught him in the very act of breaking the law:\r\nin British Bechuanaland, \"there shall be no difference in the eye of the law\r\nbetween a man with a white skin and a man with a black skin,\r\nand the one shall be as much entitled to the protection of the law\r\nas the other,\" and so in spite of scaremongers' ravings to the contrary,\r\nChief Lentsue proved himself once more on the side of the law of his Empire.\r\n\r\n    Go mokong-kong ko Tipereri,\r\n     Go mokong-kong gole;\r\n    Go mokong-kong ko Tipereri,\r\n     Go mosetsana montle.\r\n    Dumela, Pikadili,\r\n     Sala, Lester-skuer,\r\n    Tsela ea Kgalagadi, Tipereri,\r\n     Pelo ea me e koo.\r\n                             \"Tipperary\" in Rolong.\r\n\r\n\r\n        The Barolong and the War\r\n\r\nThe Barolong and other native tribes near Mafeking were keenly interested\r\nin the negotiations that preceded the Boer War.  The chiefs continually\r\nreceived information regarding the mobilization of the Boer forces\r\nacross the border.  This was conveyed to the Magistrate of Mafeking\r\nwith requests for arms for purpose of defence.  The Magistrate\r\nreplied each time with confident assurances that the Boers\r\nwould never cross the boundary into British territory.\r\nThe Transvaal boundary is only ten or twelve miles from the magistracy.\r\nThe assurances of the Magistrate made the Natives rather restive;\r\nthe result was that a deputation of Barolong chiefs had a dramatic interview\r\nwith the Magistrate, at which the writer acted as interpreter.\r\nThe chiefs told the Magistrate that they feared he knew very little about war\r\nif he thought that belligerents would respect one another's boundaries.\r\nHe replied in true South African style, that it was a white man's war,\r\nand that if the enemy came, Her Majesty's white troops\r\nwould do all the fighting and protect the territories of the chiefs.\r\nWe remember how the chief Montsioa and his counsellor Joshua Molema\r\nwent round the Magistrate's chair and crouching behind him said:\r\n\"Let us say, for the sake of argument, that your assurances are genuine,\r\nand that when the trouble begins we hide behind your back like this,\r\nand, rifle in hand, you do all the fighting because you are white;\r\nlet us say, further, that some Dutchmen appear on the scene\r\nand they outnumber and shoot you:  what would be our course of action then?\r\nAre we to run home, put on skirts and hoist the white flag?\"\r\n\r\nChief Motshegare pulled off his coat, undid his shirt front\r\nand baring his shoulder and showing an old bullet scar, received in\r\nthe Boer-Barolong war prior to the British occupation of Bechuanaland,\r\nhe said:  \"Until you can satisfy me that Her Majesty's white troops\r\nare impervious to bullets, I am going to defend my own wife and children.\r\nI have got my rifle at home and all I want is ammunition.\"\r\n\r\nThe Magistrate duly communicated the proceedings to Capetown,\r\nbut the reply from headquarters was so mild and reassuring that one\r\ncould almost think that it referred to an impending Parliamentary election\r\nrather than to a bloody war.  But the subsequent rapid developments of events\r\nshowed that the Natives of Mafeking were in advance and that those\r\nat headquarters were far behind the times.  In a short time\r\nafter the interview of the chiefs with the Magistrate,\r\nthe Boers, following the terms of their ultimatum, crossed the border\r\nbetween the Cape and Transvaal, cut the lines of communication\r\nnorth and south of Mafeking and, before any arms could reach this quarter,\r\nMafeking (a little village on the banks of the Molopo) was surrounded,\r\nwith Montsioastad, a town of 5,000 native inhabitants.\r\nThe population of these places was largely increased by refugees,\r\nboth white and black, from outside the town, and also from the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nAt this time of the investment General Cronje sent verbal messages\r\nto the chief advising him not to mix himself and his people\r\nin a white man's quarrel.  This view of General Cronje's was,\r\nat the beginning of the siege, in accord with local white sentiment.\r\nThe European inhabitants of the besieged town had a repugnance\r\nto the idea of armed Natives shooting at a white enemy;\r\nbut the businesslike method of General Cronje in effecting the investment\r\nhad a sobering effect upon the whole of the beleaguered garrison;\r\nthe Dutch 100-pounder Cruesot especially thundered some sense into them\r\nand completely altered their views.\r\n\r\nThe Barolong youth had his baptism of fire on October 25, 1899,\r\nwhen General Cronje tried to storm the garrison by effecting an entry\r\nthrough the native village.  He poured a deafening hail of nickel\r\ninto the native village.  The Natives who were concealed behind\r\nthe outer walls of Montsioastad waited with their rifles in the loopholes,\r\naccording to Captain Marsh's instructions, till the Boers\r\nwere quite near to them, then returned the fire with satisfactory results.\r\nAfter this encounter the whites, for the first time, regretted that\r\nthere were not any arms in the place with which to arm all the Natives.\r\nAs this attack was unmistakably severe and a Red Cross wagon\r\nmoved around the Boer lines in the afternoon, it was feared\r\nthat the native casualties were heavy, and medical aid was offered\r\nby the white section of the garrison.  But all were agreeably surprised\r\nto find that beyond slight damages to the housetops there were no casualties\r\namong the Barolongs.  The following was the only injury:\r\nA shell burst in front of Chief Lekoko as he was engaged\r\nin repelling the Boer attack, but no fragments of it touched him.\r\nOne piece of shell, however, struck a rock and a splinter of the rock\r\ngrazed his temple.  At best only a few rounds of ammunition\r\ncould be handed out to those of the Barolongs who used their own rifles,\r\nand it is doubtful if so little ammunition was ever more economically used,\r\nand used to greater advantage.\r\n\r\nThe investment of Mafeking was so effective that only\r\ncertain Natives could crawl through the Boer lines at night.\r\nThroughout the seven months of the siege only one white man managed,\r\nunder the guidance of two Natives, to pass into the village.\r\nAll the dispatches which came into and out of Mafeking\r\nwere carried by Barolong runners.  Before the Boers moved their stock\r\ninto the far interior of the Transvaal, the Barolongs continually\r\nwent out and raided Boer cattle and brought them into the besieged garrison.\r\nOften the raiders had to fight their way back, but sometimes as they returned\r\nwith the cattle in the night the Dutch sentries preferred to leave them alone.\r\nThe result was that General Snyman, who commanded the besiegers\r\nafter General Cronje went south, issued a general order\r\nauthorizing the shooting dead of \"any one coming in or out of Mafeking\",\r\narmed or unarmed.\r\n\r\nAt his village called Modimola, ten miles outside the beleaguered garrison,\r\nthere lived Chief Saane, uncle of the Mafeking chief.\r\nBeing apparently harmless he was not for some months molested by the Boers.\r\nLater, however, they rightly suspected him of supplying the garrison\r\nwith information.  They then took him and his followers to Rietfontein,\r\nwhere they placed him under surveillance, but Chief Saane proved\r\neven more useful in captivity than in liberty.  He used the seemingly\r\ninoffensive young men of Rietfontein, to glean all first-hand information\r\nfrom the Boers, who still had command of the lines of communication.\r\nThen he sent the news in verbal messages to his nephew, the paramount chief\r\nin the siege, who in turn communicated it to Her Majesty's officers\r\nin command.  By means of this self-constituted intelligence bureau\r\nthe garrison learnt of the surrender of Cronje -- a happy consummation\r\nof the battle of Paardeberg -- shortly after the good news\r\nreached their besiegers; and when official confirmation came from the Cape,\r\nmore than a week later, Chief Saane's messengers were there again\r\nwith fresh news of the surrender of Bloemfontein.  This news,\r\nas might be well supposed, was glad tidings to the besieged people.\r\nThey were in fact the truths that King Solomon thus sets forth:\r\n\"As cold water is to the weary soul, so is good news from a far country,\"\r\nfor, in those days, before the invention of aeroplanes and Marconigrams,\r\nno country in this wide world was further than a besieged garrison.\r\n\r\nAmong the first civilian bodies raised in Mafeking for\r\npurposes of garrison defence was the \"Cape Boy Contingent\",\r\na company of mixed classes in varying degrees of complexions.\r\nSergt.-Major Taylor, a coloured bricklayer, who led the contingent\r\nand directed the crack snipers of that company, was killed\r\nduring the fourth month of the siege, by a fragment of a huge shell\r\nin the outer trenches.\r\n\r\nHis funeral was attended by General Baden-Powell and other staff officers,\r\nand was probably the only funeral of a coloured person\r\nin the South African war that was accorded such distinguished\r\nmilitary attendance.\r\n\r\nThe language of the Cape coloured or mixed people is the same\r\nas that of the Boers, viz., the Cape Dutch.  At times during the siege\r\nour advance lines and those of the Boers used to be less than 100 yards apart,\r\nand when the wily snipers of both sides saw nothing to snipe at,\r\nthey used to exchange pleasantries at the expense of one another,\r\nfrom the safety of their entrenchments.  Sometimes these wordy compliments\r\nmade the opponents decidedly \"chummy\", to borrow a trench phrase.\r\nIn that mood, they would now and again wax derisive or become amusing,\r\nbespeaking the fates of one another or the eventual outcome of the war.\r\nWhoever got the worst of the argument used to cut off communication\r\nwith an unpleasant remark; but when it was mutually amusing,\r\nboth sides enjoyed an advantage and each joined heartily\r\nin the resulting merriment.  On more than one occasion a convivial Dutchman\r\nmomentarily forgot the martial aspect of the mutual hilarity and complied with\r\nan equally convivial coloured man's exclamation to \"kyk hier, jong\"\r\n(look here, old fellow), and directly he \"kyked\" the snipers did to him\r\nthat which from the enemy's point of view would amount to \"devil's work\".\r\n\r\nThe reader of these reminiscences will perhaps permit us to pay a tribute\r\nto the Dutch Burghers who, under General Snyman, besieged Mafeking.\r\nWhatever we may say against them, in other ways, this much must be said\r\nin their favour, namely, that they left us entirely alone on Sundays.\r\nSuch an opportunity gave the Mafeking people a chance to get about,\r\nto have a thorough wash-up, and to keep the Sabbath holy.\r\nSnipers put down their rifles on Sunday mornings, declared a day's peace\r\namong the contending forces between the opposing trenches,\r\nand pointed out to one another landmarks beyond which the opposing sentries\r\nmight not cross, since to wander past these beacons would mean\r\na sudden resumption of hostilities.  But as the landmarks\r\nwere religiously respected there seldom was any occasion\r\nto desecrate the Sabbath by the clash of arms.  We had thus\r\na whole day's recreation, when the trenchmen used to visit\r\ntheir families in the women's camp and make all-round preparations\r\nfor another week's bombardment.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cape Boys\" fought with distinction and maintained their reputation\r\nright up to the end of the siege.  Visitors to Mafeking may now see\r\nnear the obelisk in front of the pretty town hall of the famous siege town,\r\na five-pounder gun \"captured by the Cape Police during the siege\".\r\nThis gun was seized by the coloured Sergeant Bell and two other\r\nsubalterns of the \"Cape Boys\" contingent; their contingent was then\r\nunder the command of Lieutenant Currey of the Cape Police.\r\n\r\nBesides the brave coloured men who fell during the defence of Mafeking,\r\none painful effect of the siege, in connexion with this contingent,\r\nwas that of Mr. Swartz, who was blinded by an exploding Boer shell\r\nand has never been able to regain his eyesight.\r\n\r\n    Ukude, ukude Tipperary,\r\n     'Kude mpela ku hamba,\r\n    Ukude, ukude Tipperary,\r\n     Nentombi 'nhle ng' asiyo.\r\n    Hlala kahle, Piccadilly\r\n     Nawe Leicester Square\r\n    Ikude lendlhela yase Tipperary\r\n     Kona 'po nhliziyo yami.\r\n                             \"Tipperary\" in Zulu.\r\n\r\nTwo other small companies who filled their posts without reproach\r\nwere the Fingo contingent and the Black Watch, so-called, presumably,\r\nfrom the jet-black colour of the members.  The \"Black Watch\" included\r\nMozambique and Zambesi boys, Shangaans and others from among\r\nthe blackest races of South Africa.  The greatest disaster\r\nsustained by this company was when a party of thirty-three of them\r\ndashed into the Boer lines on an ill-starred attempt to loot cattle\r\nfrom the enemy's herds.  After their night's dash out of the garrison\r\nthey got to a hiding place for the day, but they were followed there\r\nand were surrounded by a Boer commando, which peppered them\r\nwith a maxim and a big gun.  They fought up to the last cartridge,\r\nbut were helplessly outnumbered and outranged by the Boers,\r\nwho killed them to a man.\r\n\r\nCattle-raiding was a dangerous business in which the crafty Barolong,\r\nwho belonged to the country, alone were well versed.  A subtle warrior\r\namong the Barolong, named Mathakgong, was a regular expert in this business.\r\nHe led the occasional Barolong dashes into the Boer lines in search of beef\r\nand he invariably managed to rush his loot into Mafeking.\r\nHe did this throughout the seven months' siege with the loss of only two men.\r\nThe only misadventure of this intrepid looter was when he attempted\r\nto rush in an unusually large drove of cattle which Colonel Plumer had been\r\nbuying and collecting at his Sefikile camp about forty miles north of Mafeking\r\nfor the besieged garrison.  Dutchmen tell us that for days they had learnt\r\nthat Colonel Plumer was arranging to send cattle into Mafeking.\r\nThey even knew the exact number -- 100 head -- and so they sent scouts\r\nto the north every day to watch the roads and warn the besiegers of the event.\r\nHence, although they had left Mafeking unobserved, when Mathakgong's party\r\napproached Mafeking on the return trip with the cattle, a strong Dutch force\r\nwas waylaying him and waiting to give him and Colonel Plumer's cattle\r\na hot reception.  They opened a rattling fusillade upon the cattle drivers,\r\nwhich could be heard from Mafeking.  Over half of the cattle\r\nwere killed in the ensuing fight, and the remainder,\r\nlike the fat carcases of the dead bullocks, fell into the hands of the Boers.\r\nThe drivers escaped with only two wounded out of the party of twelve.\r\nThey said that they owed their escape almost entirely\r\nto the carcases of dead cattle, which they used as ramparts.\r\n\r\nWhen Mathakgong heard subsequently how the Boers had planned\r\nto annihilate him and his small party, he became very indignant\r\nat what he called \"the clumsy European method of always revealing\r\ntheir intentions to the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nAway out in Basutoland, \"the Switzerland of South Africa\",\r\nthe Paramount Chief Lerothodi offered to send an army on Bloemfontein\r\nwhile the \"Free\" Staters were engaged in the British Colonies\r\nof Natal and the Cape, which they had invaded.  Lord Milner strongly\r\nforbade him from taking that step, and it was all that Sir Godfrey Lagden,\r\nthe British Resident in Basutoland, could do to restrain the Basuto warriors\r\nfrom swooping down upon the Orange \"Free\" State.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, however, the Basuto mountaineers were quickly mobilized.\r\nWord reached Maseru that General De Wet, whose guerrilla career\r\nwas then at the height of its fame, was seriously harassed by Imperial troops\r\nin the \"Free\" State, and that it was feared he would escape\r\nthrough Basuto territory.  In such a case it was ruled that the Basuto\r\nwould be justified in opening fire upon the trespassing commandoes,\r\nbut not until the Boers actually set foot upon Basuto territory.\r\nTherefore the Basutos, in anticipation of this violation of their territory,\r\nunder the leadership of Councillor Philip Modise, made a record turn-out\r\nin one night, in a mountainous country, without telegraphic communication,\r\nand where all the orders were conveyed by word of mouth\r\nby men mounted on the sure-footed Basuto ponies; so that at daybreak\r\nas the Boers at the frontier near Wepener awoke, they found the Basuto border\r\nto be one mass of black humanity.  The Basutos made strong appeals to Maseru\r\nfor permission to cross the border and rush the Boers, and again\r\nthey were forbidden.  At length General De Wet, amid a rain of British shells,\r\nwithdrew his commando and carried his operations elsewhere.\r\n\r\nGeneral De Wet, in his book on the South African War, admits that\r\nhe was once hopelessly cornered and that then his only safe way of escape\r\nlay through the territory of the Basuto.  He next proceeds to give his reason\r\nfor not violating Basuto territory:  it is that the Basutos\r\nshowed no hostility towards the Boers, and that he had no wish\r\nto provoke them.  No mention is made that armed Basutos barred his way,\r\nbut if General De Wet's restraint were voluntary it would be\r\nthe first instance in history that a Boer general had shown any regard\r\nconcerning the rights or feelings of the Natives.\r\n\r\nGeneral Botha has on several occasions mentioned the loyal assistance\r\nrendered to the Transvaal Burghers by the Natives of the Transvaal.\r\nWe may also mention the case of Chief Mokgothu, of the Western Transvaal,\r\nwho with his headmen was detained at Mafeking after the siege.\r\nIn fact that chief died in the Mafeking prison where he was interned\r\nwith the Republican political prisoners for participating in the war\r\non the side of the Republic.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion General Botha (obviously referring to Natives\r\nother than those around Mafeking) unwittingly paid a tribute\r\nto the valour of British Natives during the South African war.\r\nSpeaking in the Nieuwe Kerk, at Middelburg, Holland, the General said: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nThe Kaffirs turned against us and we not only had to fight\r\nagainst the English but against the Natives as well\r\n. . . when the attacks of the Kaffirs increased, our cause became\r\ndark and black. . . .  All these facts taken collectively\r\ncompelled us to discuss terms of peace.*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* \"De Boerengeneraals in Zeeland\", p. 29.\r\n--\r\n==\r\n\r\nThe southern defences of Montsioastad were maintained by the Barolong,\r\nunder their own chief Lekoko, in their own way and with their own\r\nrations and rifles.  These were only supplemented by supplies of ammunition,\r\nof which there was not too much in the garrison.  And the only instructions\r\nwhich Major Godley and Captain Marsh gave the defenders\r\nwas to \"sit tight and don't shoot until the enemy is quite close.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the native population in the besieged town\r\nwas under the fatherly care of Mr. C. G. H. Bell, the civil magistrate.\r\nAnd the harmonious relation between white and black as a prevailing\r\ncharacteristic of the population of the garrison throughout the siege\r\nwas largely due to the tactful management of Major Lord Edward Cecil, D.S.O.,\r\nColonel Baden-Powell's chief of Staff.  At the end of the siege,\r\nLord Roberts sent General Sir Chas. Parsons to thank the Barolong\r\nfor the creditable manner in which they defended their homes\r\nthroughout the siege.  The veteran soldier evidently thought\r\nthat he had not done enough in the matter, so later on he sent\r\nMajor the Hon. Hanbury Tracey from Pretoria with a framed address\r\nto the Barolong chiefs, written in gilt letters.\r\n\r\nColonel C. B. Vyvyan, who was escorted to Montsioastad\r\nby a squadron of the 4th Bedfordshire Regiment, headed by\r\ntheir band playing patriotic airs, presented the address\r\nin the presence of a large gathering of Barolongs and European visitors.\r\nThe ceremony was described by the `Mafeking Mail' as follows: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nWithin the square, seated on chairs and stools, were the Barolong men,\r\nwhilst the women, attired in their brightest dresses,\r\ntook up positions wherever they could get a view of the proceedings.\r\nOn the arrival of the Base Commandant (Lieut.-Colonel Vyvyan)\r\nand the Resident Magistrate (Mr. C. G. H. Bell), a Union Jack was hoisted\r\nto the accompaniment of a general cheer.  A large number of civilians\r\nand several military officers witnessed the ceremony, among them being\r\nthe Mayor (Mr. A. H. Friend), Mr. W. H. Surmon (Acting Commissioner),\r\nLieut.-Colonel Newbury (Field Paymaster), Major the Hon. Hanbury Tracey\r\n(the officer who brought the address from Pretoria), and Major Panzera.\r\n\r\nMr. Bell, addressing the assembled Natives, said:  To-day is an historical one\r\nin the history of the Barolongs as represented by Montsioa's people.\r\nI am sure it must be most satisfactory to you all who have so bravely assisted\r\nin the defence of Mafeking to have this honour conferred upon you,\r\nwhich is unprecedented in the annals of the history of the native tribes\r\nin this country.  The Field-Marshal commanding Her Majesty's troops\r\nin South Africa has expressed in the address which is about to be\r\npresented to you his thanks for the services you rendered during the siege --\r\nan honour which I am sure you will appreciate at its full value, and which\r\nI can assure you is fully recognized by the Europeans who took part with you\r\nin the defence of the town.  On many occasions bravery was displayed\r\nby both Europeans and Natives.  We have fought and risked our lives together;\r\nwe have undergone privations; we have eaten horses and various other animals\r\nof a like character; we have seen our friends fall, shattered by shells;\r\nand we have endured hardships and trials which very few men endure\r\nmore than once in a lifetime.  We have fought together for one common object.\r\nWe have attained that object, and it is now impossible for us to do otherwise\r\nthan experience a feeling of fellowship which is accentuated\r\nby the proceedings of to-day.  You Barolongs at the commencement of the siege\r\ndeclared your determination to be loyal to the Queen,\r\nand when we had a meeting here shortly before war broke out\r\nyou were assured by General Baden-Powell that if you did remain loyal\r\nyour services would not be forgotten, and the Field-Marshal\r\nhas endeavoured to-day to convince you of the truth of that statement.\r\nThere are certain names mentioned on the address; but I cannot help,\r\nwhile talking to you now, mentioning the names of other persons\r\nwho were of great assistance to us during the siege.  It was\r\naltogether impossible to include the names of everybody on the address,\r\nand some of you may think that your names are not there\r\nbecause you have been overlooked, but that is not so.  I will just mention\r\nthe names of a few which, had there been room, might have appeared.\r\nFirst, there is Saane, who remained outside and assisted our dispatch runners,\r\nand who when he heard news sent it to us.  It is only those\r\nwho suffered from news hunger at the time can understand the pleasure\r\nwe experienced at the assistance continually rendered to us by Saane.\r\nThen there is Badirile, who so bravely commanded his young men\r\non the western outposts, and who on many occasions went through\r\ndetermined encounters with the enemy.  Then again there is Joshua Molema,\r\nMotshegare and Mathakgong, all of whom did good service.\r\nThen there was Dinku, who on the day Eloff came in and when the enemy\r\nwas behind him, stuck to his little fort, and who during the attack\r\nwas wounded by a shell, which has since caused his death.\r\nHis memory will not fade away amongst you Barolongs, as he was well known\r\nas a brave man.\r\n\r\nColonel Vyvyan then stepped forward and said:  Chief Wessels and men\r\nof the Barolong nation, -- Lord Roberts, Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe British Army in South Africa, has sent a special officer from Pretoria\r\nto bring you his greeting and to deliver to you a mark of his approval\r\nand the approval which he expresses on behalf of the Queen.\r\nGathered here to-day are subjects of the Queen from various parts\r\nof her wide dominions -- men who have come overseas from England,\r\nfrom Australia, from Canada, and from India -- and they are here\r\nthis afternoon to meet her native subjects of the Barolong tribe;\r\nwhilst we, the officers and soldiers of the Queen who fought in Mafeking,\r\nwish to show what we think of our friends and neighbours\r\ndown here in the stadt.  You have done your duty well.  You will remember\r\nthat some time ago an officer was sent by Lieut.-General Baden-Powell\r\nto thank you for your services, and now the greatest General of all\r\nhas sent you a special mark of his esteem in the form of this letter,\r\nwhich I shall read to you:\r\n\r\n\r\n                       V [ Crest of Queen Victoria ] R.\r\n\r\n    \"The Chief Wessels, Lekoko, and the Barolong of Mafeking.\r\n\r\n\"I, Frederick Sleigh Baron Roberts, K.P., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., V.C.,\r\nof Kandahar and Waterford, hereby testify my approbation of the loyalty\r\nto H.M. Queen Victoria, and the good behaviour of the Barolongs\r\nunder the leadership of Wessels, Lekoko, and the headmen\r\nSilas Molema and Paul Montsioa, throughout the long and trying\r\ninvestment of Mafeking by the Boers, from October 13, 1899, to May 17, 1900,\r\nand I desire to congratulate these leaders and their people on\r\nthe successful issue of their courageous defence of their homes and property\r\nagainst the invasion of the enemy.\r\n\r\n                        \"(Signed)  Roberts,\r\n                                        Field-Marshal.\r\n\"Pretoria, July 1, 1900.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAddressing Chief Wessels, and at the same time handing him\r\nthe letter, the Colonel concluded:  I give you this\r\non behalf of Lord Roberts and the Queen.  You are to accept it\r\non behalf of your nation.  You are to keep it and show it to your children\r\nand tell them why it was given to you and that they are to be proud of it.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel held out his hand, which Wessels gripped very cordially.\r\nThe band played the National Anthem, and the Barolongs joined\r\nin one of their native cheers.\r\n\r\nWessels then rose, and taking off his white helmet,\r\nreplied on behalf of his tribe.\r\n==\r\n\r\nReplying to the address and speeches Chief Wessels Montsioa asked the officers\r\nto convey to Lord Roberts the gratitude of the Barolong\r\nfor the relief of Mafeking, adding:  \"I have gone to extremes\r\ninto which my forefathers scarcely ever went in defending their homes.\r\nI have eaten horseflesh, donkey and mule flesh, and had the relief column\r\nnot come when it did, I was going to eat dog flesh, if by that means\r\nI would have been enabled to hold up a gun and keep the enemy out of doors,\r\nuntil Lord Roberts sent relief.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain, who visited Mafeking two years later,\r\ninspected the old siege position and addressed the largest meetings\r\nwe had ever seen in Mafeking.  He said to the thousands\r\nof assembled Barolongs:  \"You ask in your addresses that the conditions\r\nsecured to you, when you were transferred from the Imperial Government\r\nto the Colonial Government should remain as they are.  I do not think\r\nthat Sir Gordon Sprigg or any one who may succeed him will alter them\r\nin any respect, and should any one attempt to alter these conditions,\r\nyou will have your appeal to His Majesty's Government.\"\r\nThis was said in the presence of Sir Gordon Sprigg,\r\nthe Cape Premier of the day, Mr. Thomas L. Graham,\r\nthe Cape Attorney-General (now Judge of the Supreme Court at Grahamstown),\r\nand Sir Walter F. Hely-Hutchinson, Governor of the Cape Colony.\r\nBut what must be the feelings of these people, and what must be\r\nthe effect of these assurances upon them now that it is decreed\r\nthat their sons and daughters can no longer settle in the Union\r\nexcept as serfs; that they no longer have any claim to the country\r\nfor which they bled, and that when they appeal to the Imperial authorities\r\nfor redress of these grievances, they are told that there is no appeal?\r\n\r\nA promise of a farm was made to the Fingo and Kafir contingent,\r\nbut that promise still remains unfulfilled.\r\n\r\nWhen His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught visited Mafeking in 1906,\r\nhe was touched by the grateful references which Chief Lekoko made\r\nto the benign rule of His Royal Highness's late illustrious mother.\r\nAnd he assured the assembled Natives, in the name of His late Majesty\r\nKing Edward VII, that the death of their beloved Queen\r\nwould \"not alter their status in any manner whatsoever as His Majesty took\r\nthe same deep interest in the welfare of the native population\r\nas the late Queen did.\"  In view of this statement by His Royal Highness,\r\nChief Lekoko congratulated his people on having had the honour of receiving\r\n\"assurances of Imperial protection, not from an Imperial official,\r\nbut from the lips of His Majesty's own brother, and in the King's English,\"\r\nthe Barolong felt that they were reclining on a veritable rock of ages.\r\n\r\nSince the inauguration and meeting of the first Union Parliament,\r\nlaws have been enacted which threaten to annul all this.\r\nAs far as the Barolongs are concerned, the Colonial Government\r\nis not the only aggressor.\r\n\r\nIn the early 'nineties a British Boundary Commission awarded\r\nthe territory of Mokgomana to a northern tribe.  The award caused\r\ngreat dissatisfaction amongst the Barolong; accordingly they sent a deputation\r\nto the High Commissioner about the award.  It was only after they announced\r\ntheir unalterable intention to assert their claim to that territory\r\nby means of the sword, that the Imperial authorities,\r\nin the name of the Queen, re-considered the former decision,\r\nand that Sir Hamilton Goold Adams restored that land to the Barolong,\r\nunder date March 11, 1896.  But the Colonial Office, completely ignoring\r\nSir Hamilton Goold Adams's signature on behalf of the Queen,\r\nand without referring the matter to the native inhabitants in any way,\r\nlately confiscated that territory and declared it the property of the Crown.\r\nIn consequence of this high-handed proceeding there is much bad blood\r\namong the Barolong.\r\n\r\nIt might be said in support of this act of the Colonial Office\r\nthat strangers will not be settled in the territory,\r\nbut Sir Garnet Wolseley once declared that \"as long as the sun\r\nshines in the heavens, Zululand shall remain the property of the Zulus.\"\r\nThe sun is still shining in the heavens, and right up to the time\r\nof the outbreak of the European War in 1914, the Union Government\r\nwere very busy cutting up Zululand and parcelling it out to white settlers\r\nunder the Land Settlement Act of the Union (for white men only),\r\nparcels of land to survey which black taxpayers are forced to pay,\r\nbut which under the Natives' Land Act no black man can buy;\r\nand what is true in regard to Zululand, British Kaffraria,\r\nEast Griqualand and other native territories, is equally so\r\nin regard to Bechuanaland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX      The South African Races and the European War\r\n\r\n  Oh! the Battle-bow is strung,\r\n  The Banner is outflung:\r\n  From lowlands and from valley,\r\n  From mountain-tops, they rally!\r\n                                       L. J. Coppin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrica is a land of prophets and prophetesses.  In the course of\r\nour tour of observation on the ravages of the Land Act,\r\nwe reached Vereeniging in August, 1913, and found the little village astir\r\nbecause the local pastor, Rev. S. H. Senamela, was returning from\r\na certain funeral service.  To many of the people of the place\r\nthe event seemed to be a momentous one, affecting as it appeared more people\r\nthan would be ordinarily the case.  The person whose death and funeral\r\ncaused all this stir was a black seeress of Vereeniging, of whom it was said\r\nthat in her lifetime she prophesied the Anglo-Boer War and some such situation\r\nas that created by the Natives' Land Act.  Before breathing her last,\r\nthis interesting lady (whose sayings carried great weight\r\namong the surrounding native peasants and the Dutch neighbours\r\non the farms of that neighbourhood) had, it was said,\r\nuttered her last prophecy.  It was to the effect that a great war\r\nwould take place in the near future, amongst the white peoples of the country,\r\nthat there would be much bloodshed, but that the survivors\r\nwould live very peacefully with the native population.  We are sorry now\r\nthat we did not care to listen to the whole story when it was related,\r\nand we very much wish that we had remained to interrogate the narrator\r\nas to whether the black population that would thus remain to share life\r\nwith the white survivors in South Africa would be a contented one, or whether\r\nthey would be living in chains, of which the thraldom of coming events\r\nappears to be casting its shadow before.  But at the time\r\nit sounded parlous to think that anything could interrupt\r\nthe calm of the tolerant British colonists and egg them against\r\ntheir Dutch rulers, who call them foreign adventurers.\r\nNor could we conceive of any reason why the Boers, who have now more freedom\r\nthan they ever dreamt of possessing under their own flag, including the right\r\nto partially enslave the blacks, should suddenly rise up against the English,\r\nwhose money and brains are ever at the beck and call of the Dutch!\r\nHere, however, is the war, predicted by the late native seeress,\r\nand evidently we have to make the best of it.\r\n\r\nThe writer was in London at the end of July, 1914, when there were\r\nmany disquieting reports about the activities of suffragettes,\r\nand when there were still more serious reports about\r\nthe unlawful mobilization of volunteer armies in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt was in this exciting period that attention was at once transferred\r\nfrom Ireland to the Continent of Europe.  There it seemed\r\nthat every moment was ticking to drive us towards the greatest war\r\nthat the world ever saw.  And though matters grew hourly more serious,\r\nit did not then occur to the writer, a stranger then of only\r\nsix weeks in London, that after seeing the capital of the Empire\r\nunder conditions of peace, he was soon to see it under a war cloud\r\nfilled with all the horrors of the approaching war storm and all the signs\r\nof patriotic enthusiasm.  We were about to see Mafeking over again,\r\nbut through the biggest magnifying glass.\r\n\r\nTo walk along Oxford Street of an afternoon and see\r\nthe multitudes of well-dressed women pouring into the streets\r\nfrom the underground stations (the \"Tube\" and the \"Met\", as they are called\r\nin the vernacular), round Charing Cross and Piccadilly, and see them\r\nwalking up and down the thoroughfares and looking at the wares displayed\r\nin the dazzling shop windows; or to come down Bishopsgate of a morning\r\nand see the stupendous swarms of white men rushing to and fro\r\nalong the pavements of Threadneedle Street, crowding the motor-buses\r\nround the Mansion House, St. Paul's and Ludgate Circus --\r\nyet all this throng so well regulated by the City Police that nobody seems\r\nto be in the other's way -- the disproportion of men and women\r\nin the East and West respectively forming a partial segregation\r\nbetween the sexes:  to see these myriads of humanity gave one the impression\r\nthat if the Garden of Eden (whose whereabouts has not yet been defined)\r\nwas not actually in London, then some very fertile human germ\r\nimported from the Garden must have been planted somewhere\r\nin the vicinity of Trafalgar Square, or the Elephant and Castle.\r\nThese great masses of people when the war broke out were swept over,\r\nas already indicated, by a wave of patriotism, and sections of them reinforced\r\nby a regular inflow from the provinces, and foreign tourists\r\n-- Americans, Scandinavians, Orientals and Colonials -- rushing back\r\nfrom the danger zone on the Continent, stranded in London\r\nwith their pockets bulging with useless credit notes, all these joined\r\nthe buzzing groups in Fleet Street in scanning the latest telegrams\r\nposted at the windows of the newspaper offices, or, going to Hyde Park,\r\nthey listened to the open-air speeches delivered there.\r\nIn this gamut of personalities and nationalities there were, at first,\r\nfaint murmurs by some of the English against their country joining the strife\r\nand in favour of her remaining neutral and leaving the Continentals\r\nto \"stew in their own juice\".  But when German seamen laid mines\r\nin the English Channel, and capped their deeds by sinking\r\nthe `Amphion' and the `Pathfinder', with hundreds of officers and men,\r\nthe \"protestants\" found that their efforts were out of date\r\nand that their arguments could have held water in the good old days,\r\nbefore the declaration of war, but not after.  For the silent determination\r\nof the London crowds, of both sexes and all colours, was so emphatic\r\nthat one could almost read it in their thoughts, and see it,\r\nas it were, percolating through every fibre of their systems.\r\nIf the weaker races of the world -- (and which race is weaker\r\nthan the coloured?) -- are ever to enjoy rest, then the great Powers\r\nmust avenge the violation of the neutrality of Belgium.\r\n\r\nEarly in August, we left London to visit the Scottish capital,\r\nand as far as the swiftness of the North British Railway\r\nwould allow a glimpse, the country towns and villages of the north\r\nappeared to be swarming with Territorials in khaki.  A painful sight\r\nat some of the stations was the number of restive horses\r\nforced into the railway trucks by troopers -- beautiful, well-fed animals\r\nwhose sleek appearance showed that they were unaccustomed to the rough life\r\nto which the Tommies were leading them.  Further, it was sad to think\r\nthat these noble creatures by their size were to be rendered easy targets\r\nfor the marksmen of the enemy's forces, and that they would in addition\r\nbe subjected to the severity of inclement weather conditions,\r\nto which they likewise were unaccustomed.\r\n\r\nAt Edinburgh, the Cameron Highlanders marched along some of the streets\r\nin their battalions, flinging the Highland kilt like the plaited reeds\r\nof so many thousands of Bojale* girls.  Handsome young Scotchmen, all of them,\r\nand it was shocking to think that these fine young fellows\r\nin the flower of their youth were going to be fired at with a set purpose\r\nto kill them as if they were a flock of springbuck on a South African veld.\r\nSurely it is time that civilization evolved a less brutal and less savage\r\nform of warfare!  On Sunday evening we attended divine service\r\nat St. Giles's Cathedral, and the critical political situation\r\npermeated the entire service.  This feeling was not lessened\r\nby the announcement that one of the gallant boys who sank with the `Amphion'\r\nwas a son of one of the sidesmen of St. Giles's.  It was war as unmistakable\r\nas it was grim.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* Bechuana circumcision rites.\r\n--\r\n\r\nAfter the declaration of war between Great Britain and Germany,\r\nthe Irish tension at once died away.  The self-constituted\r\nopposing armies of Dublin and Belfast, or rather Ireland and Ulster,\r\ncame forward and offered themselves and their arms to\r\nthe Imperial authorities.  They were anxious to proceed at once\r\nto the Continent and assert British prestige on the battlefield;\r\nthe suffragettes likewise at the outbreak of the war\r\ndeclared a truce and offered their humble services to the Empire.\r\n\"More power to their hatpins!\"  But how about South Africa,\r\nthe baby-member of the British family?  Where does she come in?\r\n\r\nWithin a week after the outbreak, Mr. Harcourt sent the following dispatch\r\nto the Governors-General of Canada, Australia and New Zealand: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nPlease communicate to your Ministers the following message from His Majesty\r\nand publish:  \"I desire to express to my people of the overseas Dominions\r\nwith what appreciation and pride I have received the messages\r\nfrom their respective Governments during the past few days.\r\nThe spontaneous assurance of their fullest support recalls to me\r\nthe generous self-sacrificing help given by them in the past\r\nto the Mother Country.  I shall be strengthened in the discharge\r\nof the great responsibilities which rest upon me by the confident belief\r\nthat in this time of trial my Empire will stand united, calm, resolute,\r\ntrusting in God.  -- George R.I.\"\r\n==\r\n\r\nMore offers of men and money came from the Dominions;\r\nand when such well-deserved Royal encomiums are showered\r\non the already laurelled heads of other dominions, a self-respecting\r\nSouth African like ourselves walked the streets with a drooping head.\r\nAnd when our kinsmen in West Africa under the leadership of British officers,\r\nannexed German Togoland rather early in the campaign, we found these questions\r\nreverting in our thoughts:  What is our Government doing?  When is it going\r\nto move?  Surely our Prime Minister, who is also Minister of Native Affairs,\r\nshould now postpone the constant pampering of the back-velders,\r\nhang colour prejudice for a more peaceful time, call out the loyal legions\r\n-- British, Boer, and Black -- and annex German South Africa without delay!\r\nAs a British General and Minister of Native Affairs, he should himself\r\nlead the black contingents and leave the whites to be led\r\nby their regular officers.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of August, a special meeting of the South African\r\nNative Congress was called at Bloemfontein, first to express\r\nits disappointment at the cold reception given to the native deputation\r\nby the Imperial Government; and secondly, to express its thanks\r\nto the British public for the kind reception given to the deputation;\r\nand thirdly, to devise ways and means for the deputation\r\nto tour the United Kingdom on a mission, revealing to the British people\r\nthe manner in which the Colonial Government discharges its trust\r\nto the coloured people.\r\n\r\nMany of the delegates to the Congress had travelled long distances\r\nby rail and road, but on their arrival at Bloemfontein it was only to learn\r\nthat war had broken out between Great Britain and Germany.\r\nHence the Native Congress, in view of the situation, resolving itself at once\r\ninto a patriotic demonstration, decided to hang up native grievances against\r\nthe South African Parliament till a better time and to tender the authorities\r\nevery assistance.\r\n\r\nMr. Dube, the president of the Congress, who had just returned from England\r\nin time for the conference, proceeded direct to Pretoria with the Executive,\r\nto lay at the feet of the Government this offer of service\r\nmade by the Native Congress.  Offers of service poured into\r\nthe administrative capital from native chiefs and people\r\nin all parts of the country.  Magistrates who held meetings in their districts\r\non the instructions of the Government to explain the situation to the Natives\r\nreceived similar offers.  And besides all these, offers of service also came\r\nfrom the Zulu chiefs and headmen, from Chief Dalindyebo of the Tembus,\r\nMarelana of the Pondos, and from Griffiths of Basutoland.\r\nIn Bechuanaland, the veteran Chief Khama and other Bechuana chiefs\r\noffered the services of native warriors as scouts in German South West Africa,\r\nand the Swazi princes offered a Swazi impi, besides undertaking to help\r\nin any other manner, as they did in the campaign against Sekukuni\r\nin the 'seventies.  The members of the native deputation in England\r\nwere longing to catch the first steamer back to South Africa\r\nto join their countrymen and proceed to the front.  But while\r\nall these offers were gratefully acknowledged, none were\r\ndefinitely accepted.  Surely there must be something wrong.\r\nIs it that the wretched South African colour prejudice is exerting itself\r\neven in these critical times?\r\n\r\nAt Pretoria, Captain W. Allan King, the popular Native Commissioner\r\nof the Pretoria District, held a meeting of Transvaal Natives,\r\nwhich amongst others was attended by His Worship the Mayor\r\nof the Union capital; and there again native offers of service were tendered.\r\nMr. Makgatho, the chairman, in his denial of the report\r\nthat appeared in the newspapers to the effect that \"South Africa\r\ncould not take the field as she had a native menace to watch\",\r\nvoiced the prevailing feeling of the Natives.  Captain King, however,\r\nassured the Natives that no such slanders were uttered by the Government.\r\nHe further reminded them that the Imperial Government\r\nwas face to face with the biggest struggle that ever took place\r\nsince the foundation of the world; and that there would be fighting\r\non land, in the air, on the water and under the water.\r\nHe urged the Natives to go to work as usual and see to it that there was\r\nno slackening of industries.  He also made a plea for the abiding respect\r\nof the Natives to the German missionaries of the Transvaal,\r\nhaving regard to what those good men had done in bygone years\r\nfor the evangelization of the Natives of that Province.\r\nHow little did any one dream at the time that he was thus pleading for others,\r\nthat Captain King would be among the victims of the war;\r\nand that he would fall, not from a German bullet, but from one fired\r\nby one of the Dutch traitors, in a brisk fight to quell\r\nthe recent Boer rebellion.\r\n\r\n     Ku mugama e Tipperary,\r\n    E malandalahla;\r\n    Ku mugama e Tipperary,\r\n     Kwe sona standwa sam.\r\n    Bhota, Piccadilly,\r\n    Sala, Leicester Square,\r\n    Kude le-le-le, e Tipperary\r\n    'Ntliziyo yam ikona.\r\n                             \"Tipperary\" in Xosa.\r\n\r\nWhite men wrote to the newspapers that as France, our great Ally,\r\nwas using Native African troops, there could be no objection\r\nagainst England doing the same -- as if England had rejected\r\nthe assistance of her coloured subjects pending a decision by France.\r\nA well-known Natal campaigner wrote to the authorities\r\noffering to raise a crack Zulu regiment composed of men\r\nwho had formerly fought for the old flag against their own people.\r\nHe said he felt certain that those Zulus could give as good\r\nan account of themselves against any regiment in the field as any force\r\nyet mobilized; but there was no definite acceptance of these offers\r\nby the Government.  The native uncertainty that arose from\r\nthis attitude of the South African Government went on until October,\r\nwhen our colleagues of the native deputation returned home from England\r\nand threw themselves into the vortex of the martial enthusiasm\r\nthat was then sweeping through the country, and as no offers were accepted\r\nby the Government, Dr. Rubusana made to it the following further offer: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nThe Right Hon. the Minister of Native Affairs, Pretoria, Transvaal.\r\n\r\nSir, --  Coming as I do so near from the scene of operations in Europe,\r\nI feel that something more practical than mere lip-loyalty is required\r\nfrom those who boast of the fact that they are British subjects, and are loyal\r\nto the British Crown, more especially during this present crisis.\r\nThat being so, I am prepared to raise, if you deem it necessary,\r\na native levy of 5,000 able-bodied men to proceed to German South-West Africa,\r\nprovided the Government is prepared to fully equip this force for the front.\r\nI should, of course, be prepared to accompany them.\r\n\r\n               I have the honour to be, Sir,\r\n                         Your obedient servant,\r\n                                   W. B. Rubusana.\r\n==\r\n\r\n==\r\n          Reply.\r\n\r\n                    Union of South Africa,\r\n                         Department of Defence,\r\n                                        Pretoria.\r\n                                   November 2, 1914.\r\n\r\nSir, --  With reference to your letter of the 20th ultimo, I am directed\r\nto state that the Union Government greatly appreciates the loyal sentiments\r\nwhich are being expressed by the native citizens of the Union.\r\n\r\nI am, however, to refer you to the provisions of Section 7\r\nof the South Africa Defence Act, 1912, and to state that the Government\r\ndoes not desire to avail itself of the services, in a combatant capacity,\r\nof citizens not of European descent in the present hostilities.\r\nApart from other considerations the present war is one which has its origin\r\namong the white people of Europe and the Government are anxious to avoid\r\nthe employment of its native citizens in a warfare against whites.\r\n\r\n                         I have the honour to be, Sir,\r\n                              Your obedient servant,\r\n                                   H. B. M. Bourne,\r\n                                        Secretary for Defence.\r\nDr. W. B. Rubusana,\r\n  East London, C.P.\r\n==\r\n\r\nGeneral Botha was once confronted with a definite request\r\nto reconcile two conflicting declarations of policies\r\nenunciated by two members of his Cabinet, and in reply to that request\r\nhe gave the following highly diplomatic explanation:  \"The one Minister\r\nhas said things which should not have been said, and the other Minister\r\nhad said things which should have been said in a different way.\"\r\n\r\nIf there is one document which contains things that should not\r\nhave been penned, or that should have been differently worded, surely it\r\nis the document we have just quoted.  Fancy refusing native assistance\r\nin the present world's war on the ground of colour!  For weeks before\r\nDr. Rubusana sailed from Europe the Turcos and Algerian and Moroccan troops\r\nhad been doing wondrous deeds on the Continent for the cause of the Allies.\r\nThese coloured troops also included a regiment of wealthy Natives\r\nfrom North Africa who had come to fight for France entirely\r\nat their own expense -- a striking evidence of what the Empire is losing\r\nthrough the South African policy of restricting native wages\r\nto one shilling a day, in a country where the cost of living\r\nis about the highest in the world.  The Union Government\r\nrejected the native offer a week after Lord Roberts laid down his life,\r\nhaving delivered the appreciation of a grateful Empire\r\nto the gallant Indian regiments who with distinction were participating\r\nin the same war; and a month after the first German General Freise\r\nwas captured in the course of a daring charge by North African Natives\r\nfrom the French Colonies; ten days after the Germans at Tsiengtau\r\nhad surrendered to the British and Japanese forces; and nearly three weeks\r\nafter the Germans had successfully involved Turkey in the strife;\r\nand while the Canadian troops on Salisbury Plain included Red Indians.\r\nWhere, then, is the wisdom of telling Dr. Rubusana, who knows all these facts,\r\nthat the Government's rejection of the native offer is due to the fact\r\nthat the present struggle is an all-white one?  The truth of the matter\r\nis that the South African Government worships an idol, which was\r\nbest described by Sir Gordon Sprigg as \"the demon of ignorance and prejudice\",\r\nand the claims of this fetish in South Africa precedes those of the Empire.\r\n\r\nUnder the old Republics we had a law which since the Union has become\r\nthe unwritten law of South Africa.  In this law it is laid down\r\nthat a coloured policeman shall not lay his black hands on a white man\r\neven if he found him red-handed in the commitment of a crime.\r\nThe duty of a coloured policeman in such circumstances would be\r\nto look around for a white constable and report the misdemeanour to him.\r\nRather than suffer the humiliation of a black official\r\ntaking a white criminal into custody white South Africa\r\nwould prefer to have the country overrun with white criminals,\r\nergo, if the safety of the Crown is at stake and it could be saved\r\nonly by employing black men, we would much rather let the Crown go\r\nthan suffer the humiliation of seeing black warriors resisting a white enemy.\r\nIf there is one point upon which white South Africa is agreed, it is that\r\nthe claims of South Africa come first and those of the Empire afterwards.\r\nThe \"bitter-enders\" go further:  they say that \"the Empire comes handy\r\nonly in so far as it is useful to us, but when we have sucked it dry,\r\nlike an orange, it must be thrown away.\"*  It may be that the blacks have\r\ntheir reasons for objecting to these creeds:  they would prefer Imperial lines\r\nall the time, for Imperial lines are benevolent while South African lines\r\nare cruel; consisting largely of repression and slavery.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* General Botha's reply to General Hertzog on the Ministerial crisis of 1912.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThere is a talk in South Africa, which unhappily is not confined\r\nto Dutch-speaking South Africans.  It advocates the elimination\r\nof the Imperial factor, because that factor is said to interfere\r\nwith colonial liberties, among which is the right to \"correct\" a Native\r\nin a manner that a colonial deems fit.  Thus, under the inconvenience\r\nof the \"pestilential Imperial factor\", a colonial Magistrate\r\nwas forced to fine General De Wet the sum of 5s. on his pleading guilty\r\nto having horse-whipped a Native.  Under German rule, which threatened\r\nthe Union, the liberty of chastising the Native according to colonial ideas\r\nwould be extended, for the German method is that of the old \"Free\" State,\r\nwhere a Native used to be tied to a wagon-wheel and whipped.\r\nIf he dies in consequence of the beating, his death was but a nominal offence.\r\nThis state of things explains the determination of the native races\r\nto fight for the retention of the Imperial factor, or for what vestige of it\r\nstill remains in the country.\r\n\r\nA native clergyman sends us the following letter.  We are not quite certain\r\nif the reverend gentleman desired to enlist as a private or as a chaplain;\r\nanyway, this is what he says:\r\n\r\n==\r\nCan it be really true that we, too, belong to the British Empire?\r\nThis war is growing in such dimensions that it is even affecting\r\nthe King's household.  The Prince of Wales has gone to the front,\r\nand His Majesty the King has also gone, yet we are told that we are not worthy\r\non account of our colour to fight for our King and Empire.\r\nWhite men only must defend the King's Dominions while we remain behind\r\nwith the women and children.  Surely it cannot be the wish of the loyal Boers\r\nthat we must not defend our Empire; it is only the wish of the rebels,\r\nand it seems that our Government will continue to study their feelings\r\neven while they are engaged in shooting down loyal people.\r\n==\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the South African Government is so deeply\r\nin love with the Natives that they are scrupulously careful\r\nlest the Natives should singe so much as a hair in the present struggle,\r\nand that white men alone may shoot and kill one another.\r\nBut, in point of fact, black men ARE required by the Union Government\r\nto proceed to the front as Government wagon drivers,\r\ndriving provisions and ammunition wagons, and acting as orderlies\r\nto the white burghers.  In these capacities they are exposed\r\nto all the risks and horrors of the war, yet even if they are shot,\r\nthey must not, under any circumstances, be mentioned in the casualty lists,\r\nnor must they carry arms, lest their behaviour should merit recognition;\r\ntheir heroic deeds and acts of valour must, on account of their colour,\r\nnot be recorded.  These native drivers are classed with the transport mules,\r\nwith this difference, that while the owner of a mule receives\r\nmonetary compensation for each animal that falls on the battlefield,\r\nor is captured by the enemy, the Government's interest in the black driver\r\nceases when he is killed.\r\n\r\nSuppose the services of these muleteers were recognized\r\nin a combatant capacity, some one might get it into his head to ask:\r\n\"Why should loyal fighting taxpayers be debarred from\r\nthe rights of the franchise that are liberally bestowed\r\non white rebels and their relations, some of whom are said\r\nto contribute nothing towards the upkeep of the State?\"\r\nSo then to refuse these Natives the right to carry arms\r\nin defence of the Empire, and to send them to the front without arms,\r\nis to deprive such inquirers of this and similar arguments.\r\n\r\nOn St. Patrick's Day, the `Westminster Gazette' appeared\r\nwith a leading article, from which we make the following extract: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nIt will be impossible, when we have had the assistance of the Indian Army\r\nin Europe, to restrict the promotion of its officers in the manner\r\nlaid down hitherto.  It will also be impossible to restrict Natives of India\r\nWHO HAVE PROVED THEIR ABILITY AND EXPERIENCE BY LONG SERVICE\r\nin their own country TO POSITIONS IN WHICH THEY ARE SUBORDINATE TO THE RAWEST\r\nNEW ARRIVAL FROM THE COVENANTED SERVICE.  All these discriminations\r\nwhich rest simply on race and are justified by no natural disability\r\nwill have to be swept away, and new and more generous conditions laid down\r\nfor the whole Indian public service.\r\n==\r\n\r\nSurely what is true in regard to the Indian public service\r\nis equally so in regard to that infallible South African taxing machine,\r\nthe adjunct of the Union Civil Service, which is officially called\r\nthe Native Affairs Department.  There, raw recruits serve their apprenticeship\r\nwhile lording it over Natives who have proved their ability and experience\r\nby a quarter of a century's service in their own country.\r\nIt is to prevent the application to South Africa of broad-minded views\r\nlike those expressed by the `Westminster Gazette' that native Africans\r\nmust not serve against the Germans.  Therefore it seems\r\nto have occurred to the authorities that the best course\r\nis to engage the Natives in a capacity in which their participation\r\nwill demand no recognition.  These statements are not mere empty phrases,\r\nfor the writer recently caused inquiries to be made through\r\nthe Department of Native Affairs in South Africa as to whether there were\r\nany Coloured People who had been killed or wounded while on active service\r\nat the front.  And the result was a long list of killed, wounded, and captured\r\nup to the end of October, 1914, among Natives and Coloured People\r\nwho had not been mentioned in the casualty lists.*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* When the enemy airmen attacked the British camp at Garub (G.S.W.A.),\r\n  on March 27, 1915, and dropped bombs on General Botha's guns,\r\n  Reuter says, \"only one Native was slightly wounded.\"\r\n--\r\n\r\nThis deference to South African prejudice would at least seem reasonable\r\nif the King's enemies also had colour scruples.  But so far from that\r\nbeing the case, Natives living far away from defended centres\r\nare always the first to suffer when a white man's war breaks out.\r\nIn fact they are always subjected to indignities from which\r\nthey would be immune if they had arms.  One of the first steps taken\r\nby the \"Free\" State rebels under General De Wet during the recent rebellion\r\nwas to dash for the nearest native owner of horses and annex their mounts.\r\nThe unarmed proprietor's recourse in that case was to take to his heels\r\nand leave the rebels to plunder his stock.  Any hesitation to run away\r\nhas involved some unfortunate Native in the danger of being horsewhipped\r\ninto the service of the King's enemies, and if he took the first opportunity\r\nto escape from the rebel commando, a detection of his act\r\nwould positively have meant a bullet behind his neck.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late Dean Green of Natal, writing years ago, said: --\r\n\r\n==\r\n\"Every chief should have his own militia and police.  Our common human nature\r\ntells us that it is the duty of every one capable of bearing arms\r\nto fit himself to be able to defend his country and Government.\r\nWere the Government to refuse permission to the chief to enrol his young men,\r\nit would inflict a wrong on them, against which their manliness would revolt.\r\nOur Government, however, is not established to alienate from us\r\nthe native races, but to attach them to us by giving them full freedom\r\nto exercise under restraints of Christianity all those instincts and desires\r\nwhich are proper to their manhood.\r\n\r\n\"The Houssas and Soudanese on the north, the negro tribes on the west,\r\nform part of the Imperial forces, and have shown themselves\r\ntrue, brave, and useful troops.  On no possible ground of justice\r\ncan the loyal Bantu tribes be placed under a ban, and refused\r\nto serve in the ranks for the defence of the Empire.  A youth debarred\r\nfrom the legitimate opportunities of exercising his manly energies will become\r\nriotous and unruly, and addict himself, for the sake of excitement,\r\nto sheep-stealing, etc.\"\r\n==\r\n\r\nThe `Christian Express', which has always acted as the mediator\r\nbetween the overbearing section of Colonial opinion\r\non the one hand and the subject races on the other, tried to allay\r\nthe disappointment of our people with the excuse that the Government\r\nrefused the native offer on the ground that it desired to use men\r\nfrom the more advanced races who are capable of being more easily trained.*\r\nIn the face of historical records, however, this argument\r\nwill not hold a drop of water.  British archives are overloaded with instances\r\nof the valour and tractability of the aboriginal races of South Africa\r\nno less than those of their nephews, the Cape Coloured People.\r\nNot having enough space to enumerate them at length we may only refer\r\nto two instances of recent date.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* The `Express' is now advocating the raising of an army of 100,000 Natives.\r\n--\r\n\r\nDuring the South African war, the writer was asked by the military authorities\r\nto recruit twelve young Natives to act as scouts in the Western Transvaal.\r\nThe young fellows were handed to Sergt. Clemens of the Cape Police\r\nfor training.  Three days after they were enrolled we met the Sergeant,\r\nwho was highly pleased with his \"raw recruits\".  He told us\r\nwith evident satisfaction that, after he had given them oral instructions\r\nin the handling and use of firearms, he took them to the range\r\nto try them at shooting; and all but two of them hit the bull's eye\r\nwith the first attempt.  This is but one isolated instance\r\nwhich is typical of the rest.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if any white man is a greater authority\r\non the character of the Zulus than Mr. R. C. Samuelson of Natal.\r\nWriting on the outbreak of the European war and the advisability of raising\r\nnative levies, he said: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nDuring the late rebellion I was captain and adjutant of 350 men\r\ncomposed of men, half of whom were Christians and the other half\r\nheathens of the Amangwane, a section of the Amabomyu tribe,\r\nwho at the beginning of the rebellion were raw recruits,\r\nbut who, after three months' drill and manoeuvring, were as expert\r\nin their drill and use of the rifle and riding as any corps in the field.\r\nIn all my dealings with all these men and many more, I found them\r\nmost attentive, most orderly, most careful about their arms,\r\nmost alert on duty, perfectly reliable, and in and out loyal\r\nto the Government and those they were under.  Having been a volunteer\r\nfor many years, and a cadet at college in the Cape, I can safely say\r\nthat I never found our people as a body so easy to manage and train\r\nin the military art, and so orderly and attentive as these natives were.\r\n\r\nI had the honour to be called upon to summon 50 of the Zulu war and Boer war\r\nheroes to be reviewed by the Duke of Connaught; many of these\r\nhad the Zulu war medal on, which the Duke took special notice of,\r\nbut the Boer war medal was not there.  These people were highly complimented\r\nby the Duke, and afterwards gave a free concert to the Royal party\r\nin the Maritzburg Town Hall, which was attended by immense crowds,\r\nthe chief song of the evening being a Zulu song specially prepared\r\nby these men, and set to music by them, in honour of the Royal party,\r\nwhich was also embossed and presented to the Royal party.\r\nThe Royal party expressed their appreciation by sending forward to me\r\none of the officers in waiting on them to thank the singers.\r\n\r\n                                   \"Izwe Lakiti\" Aug. 12, 1914.\r\n==\r\n\r\nThe writer has received several letters expressing the native resentment\r\nof the idea that they should fold their arms and cogitate\r\nwhile other British subjects, irrespective of colour,\r\nare sacrificing their lives for the defence of the Empire in this,\r\nthe darkest period of His Majesty's reign.  Our reply to each of these letters\r\nwas that the natives should subscribe, according to their small means,\r\nto the several war funds; and our latest information\r\nis that they are subscribing to the Prince of Wales' Fund,\r\nthe Governor-General's and the Belgian Relief Fund.\r\nWhen we last heard from home the Basutos had given 2,700 Pounds\r\nto the National Relief Fund, the list being headed by Chief Griffiths\r\nwith a donation of 100 Pounds.  Chief Khama of Bechuanaland gave 800 Pounds,\r\nChief Lewanika of Barotseland 200 Pounds, Chief Lekoko and two other Chiefs,\r\neach 30 Pounds, while the Zulus, Tembus and Pondos were still collecting.\r\nAt Kimberley the Natives gave concerts for the benefit of\r\nthe Mayor's Relief Fund.  At their Beaconsfield concert the Kimberley Band\r\nunder Herr Carl Rybnikar, known as the best volunteer band in South Africa,\r\nattended and gave selections; and Chief Molala of the Batlhaping\r\ngave General Botha 200 bullocks to feed the Union troops.\r\n\r\nIn April 1915 the Minister of Native Affairs gave the following\r\ntestimony of native loyalty and co-operation.  Speaking from\r\nhis place in Parliament Mr. Malan said -- \"he thought it his duty\r\nto say that the attitude of the large number of the Natives\r\nentrusted to their care, all through the troubles, had been\r\nmost exemplary and most patriotic.  There was one exception to which\r\nhe would refer,* but from the commencement, from all parts of the Union,\r\nresolutions came to the Government of expressions of loyalty\r\non the part of the Natives, and of their support in the measures\r\nGovernment was taking in connexion with the war.  They (the Natives)\r\ngave oxen and supported liberally, according to their means,\r\nthe different patriotic funds which had been established,\r\nand generally gave the Government every assistance.  The Government\r\nhad been able to enrol between 23,000 and 24,000 Natives for service\r\nin German S.W. Africa, in building railways and in transport work.\r\nThe chief of the Tembus had volunteered to send his own son\r\nto German S.W. Africa for the purpose of superintending\r\nthe members of his tribe, a large number of whom had volunteered\r\nfor the front.  All that spoke well for the Natives, and he would be\r\nneglecting his duty if he did not testify to that.\"\r\n\r\n--\r\n* The \"one exception\" referred to by Mr. Malan was the Hlubis\r\n  of Matatiele district, who forcibly resisted the cattle dipping regulations\r\n  because, they said, the frequent dipping killed their cattle.\r\n--\r\n\r\nIn opening the Rhodesian Legislative Council, on April 28,\r\nMr. Administrator Chaplin concluded by saying that the behaviour and attitude\r\nof the native population since the outbreak of the war left nothing\r\nto be desired.  All information available showed that any attempts\r\nby emissaries of the enemy to stir up trouble would fail to meet with support.\r\n\"Numerous expressions of loyalty to His Majesty have come from leading Chiefs,\r\ntaxes are readily paid, and perfect order has been maintained.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a happy land in which to live South Africa would be if,\r\ninstead of the present god of colour prejudice, we had some such confidence\r\nas is reposed in the blacks by the British authorities\r\nin East Africa and elsewhere.  The naughty white piccaninnies\r\nwho always insult inoffensive black passers-by would be taught\r\nthat the Native is a useful neighbour whose strong right arm\r\nmay be depended upon in times of trouble, instead of being taught,\r\nas they are taught in Transvaal, that every man Jack of them\r\nis a black peril monster who must not only be discriminated against,\r\nbut who must be indiscriminately insulted and repressed.\r\nThe following dispatch, published in the `Daily Chronicle',\r\nillustrates the confidence of the British authorities in East Africa\r\ntowards the blacks: --\r\n\r\n==\r\n                 East African Battle won by Native \"Non-Com\".\r\n\r\nAbout the end of September the Germans advanced 600 strong,\r\nwith six machine guns, from the Vanga side.  They were held\r\nat Margerini on September 25 by Captain Wavel's Arab Company,\r\nand some King's African Rifles under Captain Stoner arrived from Jubaland\r\non the 27th, none too soon to reinforce Captain Wavel,\r\nthe enemy in the meanwhile having become very aggressive.\r\n\r\nThe German plan of attack was to destroy the Salisbury bridge,\r\nwhich connects Mombasa island with the mainland, thus securing\r\none of the most important strategical positions in East Africa.\r\n\r\nThe \"Koenigsberg\" did not arrive, perhaps because of the nearness\r\nof British warships, and the little British force of 300 men\r\ndislocated the land operations of the enemy.  \"C\" Company held off the Germans\r\nuntil October 2, when they were reinforced by Indian troops.\r\nThe Jind Infantry behaved particularly well at Gazi, where they had to face\r\na very heavy fire from the six machine guns of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe King's African Rifles deserve special mention.  Major Hawthorn,\r\nwho was in command, and all the European officers, were wounded\r\nearly in the engagement, thus leaving the little force leaderless.\r\n\r\nColour-Sergeant Sumani quietly took charge, and led on his men as if nothing\r\nhad happened.  He gave the order to charge, and the enemy broke and fled.\r\nThis incident has not yet appeared in the bald official announcements,\r\nbut it is hoped the splendid conduct of the native colour sergeant\r\nwill receive recognition.*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* Sergeant Sumani has since been decorated with the D.S.O.\r\n--\r\n==\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI     Coloured People's Help Rejected / The Offer of Assistance\r\n                  by the South African Coloured Races Rejected\r\n\r\n  The Africans and their descendants in America have proven to the world\r\n    that they do not lack courage and military ardour.  This the French\r\n    have recognized by enlisting them in their present struggle.\r\n    We hope for the sake of the Africans that they will give\r\n    a good account of themselves, but the coloured race is like the Irish\r\n    who are invincible in fighting for other nations, but not for themselves.\r\n                                       An American on the Great War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe African Political Organization was early in the field.\r\nDr. Abdurahman, its president, during the first week of the war,\r\nhad a force of 3,000 coloured men at Capetown ready to take the field\r\nagainst the Germans.  These men included those who had fought\r\nfor the British flag, side by side with the British troops\r\nin the Matabele wars and other South African campaigns in various capacities.\r\nIn a few days the number of this force rose to 5,000 able-bodied men\r\nready to go to the front.  A definite offer of the service of this force\r\nwas communicated to the Union Government, who replied that the offer\r\nwas under consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. William Hosken, the famous Johannesburg politician,\r\nmember of the Transvaal Parliament before the unification of South Africa\r\n-- a gentleman whose legislative talents are now unfortunately in abeyance,\r\nbecause his liberal views on colour are too advanced\r\nfor the palates of the lily-white voters of his State --\r\noffered to pay the cost of recruiting such a coloured force.\r\nApplication forms were scattered throughout the country, asking volunteers\r\nto send in their names and addresses to the A.P.O. headquarters\r\nsignifying their intention to serve as units of the Hosken Division.\r\nOur old friend Mr. N. R. Veldsman, a coloured political organizer\r\nof considerable ability, who had been in retirement for the past year or two,\r\ncame forward, took his place among the coloured leaders,\r\nand addressed patriotic meetings at Saron and other Cape districts\r\non behalf of the recruiting movement.\r\n\r\n==\r\n                            PATRIOTIC DEMONSTRATION\r\n\r\nThe City Hall, Capetown, was packed on Monday night, August 31, 1914,\r\nwith coloured citizens of Capetown, who had assembled to express\r\ntheir loyalty to King George and their determination to support the Government\r\nduring the present crisis.\r\n\r\nSir Frederick Smith, who presided, thought the coloured people\r\nhad taken a wise course in calling that meeting to tender\r\ntheir assistance to the Government while Britain was engaged in war.\r\nHe was confident that that demonstration would receive\r\nthe grateful appreciation of the Prime Minister, his Cabinet,\r\nand also of H.M. King George.\r\n\r\nDr. Abdurahman said that the coloured people had met in public meeting\r\non many occasions, but never in the history of South Africa\r\nhad they been called together on a more solemn occasion,\r\nnor at a more critical juncture, and never when the issues were fraught\r\nwith greater consequences.\r\n\r\nThe coloured people had many grievances, but all that must be forgotten\r\nwhile danger was threatening the very existence of the Empire.\r\nIf the Empire fell, South Africa would fall, Capetown would fall,\r\nand Capetown might even be laid in ruins.\r\n\r\nAlthough England was engaged in a life and death struggle,\r\nSouth Africans felt secure and could sleep in peace.  That security was due\r\nto the supremacy of the British Navy.  They had met that night to decide\r\nhow they could assist the Empire.  He moved the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"That the coloured citizens of Capetown, in mass meeting assembled,\r\nunder the auspices of the A.P.O., hereby express their loyalty\r\nto H.M. King George V, and take this opportunity of placing on record\r\ntheir recognition of the fact that the security that they at present enjoy\r\nis due primarily to the supremacy of the British Navy; and further,\r\nthey pray that Britain's efforts during the war will be crowned with success.\r\nThat a copy of this resolution be forwarded to H.E. the Governor-General\r\nfor transmission to H.M. the King.\"  (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMr. J. C. Carelse, in seconding the resolution, remarked that that\r\nwas not the time to consider their own troubles, but to show the enemy\r\nthat they stood together as a united Empire against any foe who dared\r\nto lower the Union Jack.  The resolution was adopted with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nMr. N. R. Veldsman appealed to the coloured people to assist those\r\nwho as a result of the war might suffer.  The coloured people\r\nshould spend less on bioscopes and trivialities, and contribute to a fund\r\nwhich it was proposed to raise.  He moved the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"That, in order to alleviate the suffering which inevitably accompanied war,\r\nan appeal is hereby made to the coloured citizens of the Union\r\nto contribute to a fund to be administered by the following committee:\r\nThe Rt. Rev. Bishop J. A. Johnson, Mrs. Wooding, Mrs. Abdurahman, Mrs. Gow,\r\nDr. Gool, Dr. Abdurahman, the Rev. F. Gow, Messrs. C. J. Carelse, S. Reagon,\r\nN. R. Veldsman, S. F. Geyer, P. Grever, H. Hartog, B. Baron, H. Cressy,\r\nA. Arendze, H. J. Gordon, R. Hoedemaker, W. A. Roberts, M. J. Fredericks,\r\nFred Hendricks, H. A. Gamildien, Pfieffer, and George Fife.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Gow seconded the resolution, and said that\r\nalthough the spirit of war was in the air, there was also\r\na spirit of helpfulness in the air.  They should at this period\r\nforget race and creed and contribute to the fund.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wooding, who spoke in support of the resolution,\r\nremarked that the coloured women would be found ready to do their duty\r\nwhenever the call went forth.  The best way to show loyalty to the Empire\r\nwas by rendering some service.  The resolution was unanimously adopted.\r\n\r\nDr. Gool said that another way of giving practical assistance to the Empire\r\nwas by raising volunteer corps for active service.  He moved:\r\n\r\n\"That the offer made through the A.P.O. to raise volunteers\r\nfor active service at home or abroad be approved, and that this meeting\r\ntenders to the Union Government its loyal support during the present crisis.\"\r\n\r\nMr. S. Reagon, who seconded, said that they were excluded\r\nfrom the Defence Force.  But as the Empire was endangered\r\nhe hoped an opportunity would be given the coloured people\r\nto take a part in the fighting line.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was agreed to.  The sum of 37 Pounds was raised\r\nduring the evening.\r\n\r\nMr. H. Seymour rendered some patriotic selections on the organ.\r\nThe meeting concluded with the singing of the National Anthem.\r\n==\r\n\r\nAt Johannesburg, Mr. Koopman presided over a crowded meeting\r\nof the Rand branches of the Coloured Organization, which unanimously\r\nendorsed the proposal to raise the corps.  Similar meetings,\r\nunder the respective chairmanship of Mr. Keiler, Mr. Samuels,\r\nand Mr. I. Joshua, were held by the Pretoria town and country branches\r\nand at Kimberley.  At Pretoria, Revs. G. Weavind and Mr. Hanford,\r\nboth missionaries, also spoke offering to associate themselves\r\nwith the coloured people in any benevolent efforts undertaken\r\nto alleviate the distress that might follow the outbreak of the war.\r\nPort Elizabeth and other district branches also moved\r\nin the same direction.  Capetown, the headquarters of the Organization,\r\nwas the centre of these activities, and a number of coloured women\r\nwrote to the A.P.O. secretary offering their services as nurses\r\nto accompany the coloured volunteer force to German South-West Africa,\r\nso that the coloured people, as the A.P.O. newspaper puts it,\r\n\"have closed their book with its ugly record against the Botha Government,\r\nand offered the Prime Minister their loyal support during the war.\"\r\n\r\nBut while these things were in progress, the Union Defence Force,\r\nwhich had mobilized near the German frontier under Colonel Maritz,\r\nrebelled against the Crown, and with their arms and ammunition\r\nthey joined the Germans.  This act of rebellion occasioned the greatest alarm\r\namong the coloured population near the boundaries of German South-West Africa.\r\nAnd they appealed to the Government for arms to protect\r\ntheir homes and properties.  They remembered what happened\r\nduring the Boer War, when the Dutch inhabitants of those districts\r\njoined their kinsmen from across the Vaal, and how that Natives who were armed\r\nalways remained free from molestation.  That their present fear\r\nwas not groundless the following declaration shows: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nI herewith declare that my brother and I were on a visit\r\nto the farm Groen Doorn, Cape Province, on the morning of September 16, 1914.\r\n\r\nWhen we got opposite the police camp, we were surprised to see the camp\r\ninvaded by Germans.  The Germans then beckoned us to come up,\r\nand told us that we were prisoners, and that we must go with them\r\nto the station of Ukamas.  My brother on hearing that\r\nturned his horse and galloped back.  The Germans called on him\r\nto halt at once, but he did not stop.  Then they fired at him,\r\nand shot him dead.\r\n\r\nMy brother was left lying where he fell.  After he was shot\r\nI asked if I could go to him, but the Germans would not allow me.\r\nAfterwards I was taken to the German camp, where I found\r\nall the coloured people of Groen Doorn that were captured by the Germans.\r\nTwo old women who were too weak to walk all the way were left half-way\r\nwithout either food or water; one of the two was a cripple,\r\nand the other an old woman between sixty and seventy years of age.\r\n\r\nI stayed at the German camp at Nakob till the first German patrol\r\nwent back to Groen Doorn to guard.  Then that same evening I ran away\r\nfrom the German camp, and fortunately got safe home to my house at Nudab.\r\n\r\nI again declare that this story is an exact reproduction of what I have seen\r\nwith my own eyes.\r\n\r\n                                        (X his mark)\r\n                                   Jacobus Bezuidenhout.\r\nWitness:  T. Kotzee.\r\n  Signed at Keimoes this 6th day of October, 1914.\r\n==\r\n\r\nThis statement was conveyed to the Union Government by Mr. M. J. Fredericks,\r\nsecretary of the African Political Organization.  With it there was a request\r\nby a meeting of coloured people at Calvinia and adjacent districts\r\nnear the German frontier asking for arms.  General Smuts replied,\r\nregretting the situation in which the coloured residents of\r\nthe districts of Calvinia, Kenhardt, Keimoes, and Upington found themselves;\r\nand said that he hoped the Union forces would ere long remove the cause\r\nof their anxiety.  He added that the question of arming coloured citizens\r\nhad been carefully considered by the Government, but that, for reasons\r\nalready published, their request for arms could not be complied with.\r\n\r\nFinally General Smuts expressed regret at the shooting of the brother\r\nof Jacobus Bezuidenhout.  \"Apparently the deceased had been shot\r\nbecause he attempted to escape, and in the circumstances,\" added the General,\r\n\"the Germans were clearly justified in shooting him.\"\r\n\r\nIf General Smuts is right in his concluding remarks, then the Germans are\r\nquite justified in pillaging Belgium, as the reason they ravaged that country\r\nwas because the Belgians refused to comply with a plain request\r\nto allow German troops to proceed through Belgium to France.  But whatever\r\nthe view of the South African Government might be on these subjects,\r\nwe would like to point out that it is against a coloured man's grain\r\nto obey the orders of a man, no matter who, if he is at war\r\nwith the coloured man's chief.  It would be nothing unusual for a German\r\nto order a coloured man about in times of peace, but once war was declared,\r\nit became an outrage upon the traditions of the blacks to obey Germans\r\nwho were now the enemies of their country.\r\n\r\nGeneral Smuts will no doubt remember his own operations in 1901,\r\nbefore he became a British subject.  How he then invaded Cape Colony,\r\nand got a number of recruits from among the Dutch inhabitants\r\nof certain Cape districts.  How eventually, when he came\r\nto the district of Calvinia, his burghers, reinforced by rebels,\r\nfound a coloured blacksmith there, by the name of Abraham Ezau.\r\nHow the burghers demanded certain information from this man,\r\nand he refused to supply enemies and rebels of the Crown with any information.\r\nThat the man was severely ill-treated and tortured, but that\r\nhe would not disclose anything.  And how that a gang of Boers\r\ndragged this coloured man out of the town and shot him down;\r\nthat they also looted Abraham Ezau's shop and took away\r\nthe murdered man's tools, which his widow never recovered, and for which\r\nthe writer has been informed she never received any compensation.\r\nThe Cape Government, prior to the Union, erected a tombstone\r\nover the grave of this man, who sacrificed his life for it rather than betray\r\nhis country.  And the sight of that memorial stone was no doubt\r\na grim reminder to the inhabitants of Calvinia of what would happen\r\nif the rebels invaded Calvinia once more.\r\n\r\n    Burra dur hai Tipperary\r\n     Bahoot lumbah koouch wo\r\n    Burra dur hai Tipperary\r\n     Sakki pas pownchenay ko\r\n    Ram ram Piccadilly\r\n     Salaam Leicester Square\r\n    Burra, burra dur hai Tipperary\r\n     Lakin dil hoaye phus-gayah.\r\n                             \"Tipperary\" in Hindustani.\r\n\r\nThe Natives and the Cape coloured Afrikanders were not alone in tendering\r\nloyal offers of service to the Government.  The Indians of Natal\r\nand other coloured residents likewise offered their services\r\nto the Government, besides subscribing liberally according to their means\r\nto the various war funds.  The St. Helenians of Capetown passed\r\nthe following resolutions, which Mr. S. Reagon, the secretary,\r\nforwarded to the Government: --\r\n\r\n(1)  That this meeting of St. Helenians expresses its unswerving and devoted\r\n     loyalty to His Majesty King George and His Governments.\r\n\r\n(2)  That it expresses its full confidence in the Union Government\r\n     in the present crisis through which the Empire and Union are passing,\r\n     and congratulates General Botha, and expresses its deep appreciation\r\n     of his practical patriotism in having taken command of the Union Forces\r\n     in the field.\r\n\r\n(3)  That the services of the Association and its members be hereby offered\r\n     to the Union Government in whatever manner they may be of assistance\r\n     to ensure the triumph of the Empire and for the maintenance\r\n     of law and order.\r\n\r\nShortly after the outbreak of the present war, Dr. Abdurahman\r\noffered the Government the services of the 5,000 coloured warriors\r\nrecruited through the A.P.O., and General Smuts replied that the offer\r\nwas under consideration.  Meanwhile the A.P.O. recruiting agency\r\nhad been continuing its work, and no fewer than 13,000 coloured men\r\nhad sent in their names and addresses and signified their intention to take\r\nthe field.  So Mr. Fredericks, the secretary of the A.P.O., wrote once more\r\nto General Smuts, on October 23, offering the services of these men\r\nin the name of the Coloured People's Organization.  This offer brought forth\r\nthe following definite reply, which is couched in identical terms\r\nto the one sent on the same date to Dr. Rubusana, who wrote offering\r\nthe services of 5,000 Natives: --\r\n\r\n==\r\n                         Department of Defence,\r\n                                        Pretoria,\r\n                                   November 6, 1914.\r\n\r\nSir, --  With reference to your letter of the 23rd ult.,\r\nI beg to inform you that the Union Government greatly appreciates\r\nthe offer of service of the Cape coloured people.\r\n\r\nI am, however, to refer you to the provisions of Section 7\r\nof the South African Defence Act, 1912, and to state that the Government\r\ndoes not desire to avail itself of the services in a combatant capacity\r\nof citizens not of European descent in the present hostilities.\r\nApart from other considerations, the present war is one which has its origin\r\namong the white peoples of Europe, and the Government is anxious to avoid\r\nthe employment of coloured citizens in a warfare against whites.\r\n==\r\n\r\nNo doubt the Government of British South Africa was actuated\r\nby the loftiest motives in rejecting voluntary offers of service\r\nfrom citizens of non-European descent; but it is clear that such a reply\r\nat such a time ought not to please many people in Great Britain who had\r\nto offer the cream of British manhood to defend their portion of the Empire,\r\nand then to offer in addition more men to lay down their lives\r\nfor the safety of the Colonies, including South Africa,\r\na land with thousands of able-bodied and experienced warriors\r\nwho are willing to defend their own country.  For the same reason\r\nthis decision ought not to please our French Allies, who,\r\nbesides sacrificing men and money on the battlefields of Continental Europe,\r\nmust provide more men and money to guard their colonial possessions\r\nin different parts of the globe.  This decision ought not also to cheer\r\nany one in Belgium, where fathers and mothers and their children\r\nare separated and starving, a nation living practically in exile,\r\nor in bondage, its brave monarch sojourning in foreign territory.\r\nOn the other hand, if there is any one place where this decision\r\nof the Government of British South Africa would be hailed\r\nwith the liveliest satisfaction, it is certainly Berlin,\r\nand that particularly after the bitter experiences of German troops\r\nin encounters with native African troops, both in Continental Europe\r\nand in East and West Africa.\r\n\r\nSimilarly this decision of the South African Government ought not to please\r\nthe Boers themselves, inasmuch as, finding the request for volunteers\r\namongst the whites failed to secure sufficient men, the Union Government\r\nhad perforce to resort to coercion, in that some 300 Boers who refused\r\nto enlist for service in the expedition to German South West Africa\r\nwere fined or imprisoned.  This course, which is practically conscription,\r\nwould have been unnecessary had the Union Government accepted\r\nthe offered service of the 18,000 and more volunteers whom it curtly rejected.\r\n\r\nThe coloured people, judging by the letters that many of them have sent\r\nto the Press, felt humiliated to find that during the Empire's darkest hour\r\na Government to which they pay taxation is publishing decisions\r\nthat ought to wound the feelings of the Allies' sympathizers\r\nand give satisfaction to the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt is just possible that the Government refused the offer\r\nof the coloured people in deference to the wishes of a section\r\nof the white people of the Union; but judging from the African Press,\r\nthat section, although somewhat noisy, was an infinitesimal one.\r\nThis section, as is shown from the extract below, also discussed\r\nthe voyage of the Indian troops to Europe.  The `East Rand Express', a paper\r\npublished in one of the most important suburbs of Johannesburg, said: --\r\n\r\n==\r\n                          COLOURED TROOPS AND THE WAR\r\n\r\nThe news that Great Britain intends to employ Indian native troops\r\nagainst the Germans has come as a shock to many South Africans.\r\nWe can but hope the news is incorrect.  In our opinion it would be\r\na fatal mistake to use coloured troops against the whites, more especially\r\nas plenty of whites are available.  From the English standpoint\r\nthere is probably nothing offensive in the suggestion.  Most Home people\r\ndo not seem to see anything repugnant in black boxers fighting whites,\r\nbut they have not had to live in the midst of a black population.\r\nIf the Indians are used against the Germans it means that\r\nthey will return to India disabused of the respect they should bear\r\nfor the white race.  The Empire must uphold the principle that a coloured man\r\nmust not raise his hand against a white man if there is to be any law or order\r\nin either India, Africa, or any part of the Empire where\r\nthe white man rules over a large concourse of coloured people.\r\nIn South Africa it will mean that the Natives will secure pictures of whites\r\nbeing chased by coloured men, and who knows what harm such pictures may do?\r\nThat France is employing coloured troops is no excuse.\r\nTwo blacks in any sense do not make a white.  The employment of native troops\r\nagainst Germany will be a hard blow on the prestige of the white man.\r\n==\r\n\r\nThese emotionalists urge the Imperialists against the use of black warriors\r\nfor the simple reason that it would give them (the emotionalists) \"a shock\".\r\nSo that the agony of British troops and the anxiety of British\r\nwives and mothers is not to be lessened, nor the perils of non-combatants\r\ngreatly minimized, or the war hastened by a decisive concentration\r\nof the Empire's forces on the battlefield, because of the \"shock\"\r\nit would give the emotionalists for black to fight against white.\r\nThe common-sense view would show the advantage in permitting all subjects,\r\nincluding the coloured races of South Africa, to take part in the struggle\r\nand thus enable the authorities to place more men on the Continent,\r\ninstead of sending drafts of Imperial troops to take the places of men\r\nat the outposts of the Empire, who are disqualified solely by their colour.\r\n\r\nLast New Year the author received a letter from a well-known British mother\r\nconveying her well-wishes besides the following moving particulars: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nWe are almost beside ourselves with grief over this awful war.\r\nMy young nephew has been home on a nine days' holiday at Christmas\r\nand he has now returned to the front.  He has been awarded the D.S.O. for\r\nblowing up a bridge and so delaying the Germans in the march upon Paris.\r\nMy cousin, Mrs. ----, has lost her two only sons -- both killed\r\non the same day -- December 21.  Besides other English friends and relatives\r\nfighting on the British side, I have also a young German cousin\r\nfighting on the other side.  He has been so badly wounded in his throat\r\nthat the vocal chords have received such an injury as to lead\r\nto the loss of his voice, and his career as a barrister is probably at an end.\r\nHis poor mother is a widow and has only one other son, who is very delicate.\r\n==\r\n\r\nThe writer has during the past six months come across\r\ninstances of the loss of an only son, but all these agonies count as nothing\r\nto your colourphobic emotionalists, who must, at any price,\r\nbe spared their \"shock\" regardless of the sufferings of others.\r\nNow ask these men what they would offer the Empire as a substitute\r\nfor the coloured troops whose employment against the enemy\r\ngives them \"the shock\", and you will find that they have nothing to offer\r\nbut their colour prejudice.\r\n\r\nWhat, for instance, could the leader-writer of the `East Rand Express'\r\noffer to the Empire in place of the generous help rendered to it\r\nby the Maharajah of Mysore, a lad of only eighteen years of age,\r\nwho besides the services of his men gave the \"trifle\" of 330,000 Pounds,\r\nor in place of the present of the Nizam of Hyderabad,\r\nwho contributed 396,000 Pounds towards the cost of the Hyderabad contingent;\r\nor the Maharajah Scindia of Gwalior, who handed to King George,\r\nas a Christmas present for the troops, a \"tiny fleet\"\r\nof forty-one motor-ambulances, four motor-cars for officers,\r\nfive motor-lorries and repair wagons, and ten motor-cycles;\r\nor to come nearer home, and to deal with a more modest gift,\r\nthe two hundred bullocks which Chief Molala Mankuroane, near Kimberley,\r\ngave General Botha to feed the Union troops?\r\n\r\nAnd when these liberal sacrifices are made by black men\r\nfor the safety of the Empire, INCLUDING BRITISH SOUTH AFRICA,\r\none is constrained to ask:  Where are those loud-mouthed pen-men who,\r\npossessed of more pretension than foresight, wrote bombastic articles\r\nin the Transvaal Press before the war, threatening that \"South Africa\r\nwill cut the painter\", and \"paddle her own canoe\", if men and women in Europe\r\nmade themselves a nuisance by advocating ideas of justice\r\nin favour of the blacks?  General Botha confessed last September\r\nthat the South African Government tried to, but could not,\r\nborrow more than 2,000,000 Pounds; that the Imperial Government\r\nhad come to the rescue and \"helped the Union out of its embarrassment\r\nwith a loan of 7,000,000 Pounds\" of British money.  When from his seat\r\nin the Union House of Assembly the Prime Minister announced this failure,\r\nwhy did not these secessionists come forward and display\r\ntheir \"paddling\" capacity?  What has suddenly become of them?\r\n\r\nIs it not about time that the Empire recognized the unprofitableness,\r\nand even the ruinous policy, of these gentlemen, and that it ceased\r\npaying so much attention to those whose views are distorted\r\nby colour prejudice, whose object is to inflict unnecessary harm\r\non the minds, bodies and spirits of loyal subjects of the Crown?\r\nOne cannot help saying that if their career in this respect is not checked,\r\ntheir evil policy will land the Empire in a tangle of difficulties\r\nfrom which its rescue will require the highest statesmanship,\r\nmuch expenditure of treasure, if not also the shedding of blood.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that coloured men ARE serving the Empire at the front,\r\nbut mainly in capacities that do not involve their recognition.\r\nWe have recently read of the trial of two coloured men at Willowmore,\r\nin the Cape Province.  They were said to have expressed the view\r\nthat if coloured persons are not fit to fight for the Empire \"in a war\r\noriginating entirely among Europeans\", they could not be considered fit\r\nto drive military wagons in the same war.  Recruiting of military drivers\r\nwas in progress at the time, so they were charged under martial law,\r\nand sentenced to nine months, with hard labour, for obstructing\r\nthe recruiting work.  In this case our difficulty is that, not being a lawyer,\r\nwe are not able to draw the fine distinctions between legal phrases.\r\nBut to our untutored lay mind it seems that if to give expression\r\nto such logic (whereby ten drivers may think twice before enlisting)\r\nis a crime under martial law, then it should be over ten times more criminal,\r\nunder the same law, for a Government to refuse the offer of service,\r\nin the same war, of 18,000 warriors and thereby barring\r\nthe enlistment of a possible 80,000.\r\n\r\nOne of the best replies to colour sentimentalists which we have ever read\r\non this subject is quoted from the `New York World' by the `Crisis'\r\n(Professor Du Bois's paper) of the same city.  Says the `New York World': --\r\n\r\n==\r\nThe German Ambassador has announced to the United States\r\nthat he is \"unconditionally opposed\" to the use of coloured troops.\r\nThis is a curious prejudice on the part of the diplomatic representative\r\nof a Government that is seeking to bring Turkey into the conflict\r\nand trying to persuade the Turk to instigate a \"holy war\" in Egypt and India\r\nagainst all non-Mohammedans.\r\n\r\nWhen Germany went to war with the British Empire she must have expected\r\nto fight the British Empire, and not merely a selected part of the population,\r\nthe colour of whose skin happened to meet the approval of Berlin.\r\n\r\nIt is natural enough that Great Britain should bring up her Indian troops,\r\nwho, by the way, are as completely identified with the Aryan race\r\nas the Prussians.  But no matter what their race may be, they are\r\npart of the Empire and part of Great Britain's regular military power.\r\n\r\nIf Germany were at war with the United States her troops would have to meet\r\nour Negro Cavalry, than whom there are no better soldiers in uniform.\r\n\r\nGerman denunciation of the Indian troops is as futile as German denunciation\r\nof the Japanese as \"yellow-bellies\".  It is too late to draw\r\nthe colour line in war.  That line was erased more than fifty years ago\r\nby Abraham Lincoln in that noble letter to the Springfield Convention:\r\n\"And there will be some black men who can remember that,\r\nwith silent tongue and clenched teeth and steady eye and well-poised bayonet,\r\nthey have helped mankind on to this great consummation.\"\r\n==\r\n\r\nOne South African writer to the Press had humanitarian reasons\r\nagainst the employment on the Continent of coloured troops from India.\r\nHe said that 70,000 of them will be like a morning meal\r\nto the trained soldiers of Germany.  This sympathetic view\r\ndoes not appear to be shared by German writers to the `Berliner Tageblatt',\r\nwho have a high regard for the ferocity of \"these Eastern devils\".\r\nApparently this is the only German view which is in harmony with\r\nthe dispatches of Generals French and Joffre.  His Majesty the King has since\r\nbeen to the front, where, in the presence of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales,\r\nSir Pertabh Singh and other high Imperial officers, His Majesty personally\r\ndecorated Havildar Darwan Sing Negi (an Indian) of the 39th Garhwal Rifles,\r\nwith the Victoria Cross, and we need hardly add that V.C.'s are not awarded\r\nfor fun.\r\n\r\nOn the first Saturday in March, 1915, King George went to Aldershot and acted\r\nas starter in the big military race in which over 500 soldiers competed.\r\nHer Majesty the Queen was also present and graciously distributed the prizes.\r\nThe race was won by Private Stewart, a black trooper from Jamaica.\r\nEven the Coldstream Guards have their coloured private in training\r\nfor the front; but South Africans inform you that the heavens will fall\r\nif coloured troops are sent against the white Germans,\r\nwho, from the beginning, never scrupled to send black warriors\r\nagainst the British.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the award of the V.C. to Indians, many writers sent letters\r\nto the Press claiming that it was unprecedented for coloured warriors\r\nto wear the V.C.  Whitaker and similar publications might have told them\r\nthat a Native African sergeant of the West Indian Regiment wears\r\nthe V.C. won on the Gambia River as long ago as 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII    The South African Boers and the European War\r\n\r\n  I slept and had a vision; and what was it about?  For lo and behold,\r\n    the sky was covered with a dark cloud on which was impressed\r\n    the number 15, and blood issued from this cloud.  Thereupon I beheld\r\n    General Jacobus De la Rey returning to his Lichtenburg home\r\n    without a hat on his head, and he was closely followed by a carriage\r\n    full of flowers.\r\n                                       Niklaas Rensburg (the Boer Prophet).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out, there was no question, as far as\r\none section of the whites were concerned, as to the duty of South Africans,\r\nbut the majority of the unofficial Dutch and German sections\r\nwere for remaining neutral and taking no part whatever in the struggle,\r\neither for or against the Crown.  Among the Backvelders there appeared\r\nto have been some misunderstanding as to whether the South Africans\r\nwere subjects or merely friends of the British Government.\r\nThis bewilderment became more confusing during the interval\r\nbetween the outbreak of the war and the meeting of the Union Parliament.\r\nAll kinds of ideas were expressed in the Press.  The progressive section,\r\nmainly English, urged not only that South Africa had no alternative\r\nbut to join the struggle, but they actually raised volunteer corps,\r\nwhich they proceeded to equip for service in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe regular volunteer forces of the country went forward\r\nat an early period of the campaign, and took the German ports.\r\nIn connexion with the mobilization of these forces a regrettable catastrophe\r\nmust be recorded here.  The long train in which the Kaffrarian Rifles,\r\nmostly English, were going from King Williamstown, via Capetown, to the front,\r\nwas derailed near the Hex River, and the gallant Riflemen\r\nhad eight killed and about a hundred wounded.  They are sons\r\nof the old English settlers of the Eastern Province, and some are members\r\nof European families who are very popular with the Natives of the Cape,\r\nso that white and black alike felt deeply the result of the catastrophe.\r\nGeneral Lukin, who was in charge of the advance forces, quickly went up\r\nthe South-Western Coast, and forced the enemy to evacuate his ports\r\nand retreat inland towards Windhuk, the capital of the German Colony.\r\nGeneral Beyers and the rest of the Defence Forces which were entrusted\r\nwith the land operations also mobilized.  The mobilization of this force\r\ntook an extraordinarily long time, but it was satisfactorily explained that\r\nthe marshalling of the citizen forces had to await the sanction of Parliament,\r\nwhich did not meet until September 10, 1914.\r\n\r\nA special session of the Union Parliament took place on this day,\r\nat which General Botha, the Union Premier, made a great speech.\r\n\r\n==\r\nIn the course of his speech General Botha said that the Imperial Government\r\nhad informed the Government that certain war operations\r\nin German South-West Africa were considered to be of strategic importance.\r\nThe Imperial Government added that if the Union Government\r\ncould undertake these operations they would be regarded as of great service\r\nto the Empire.  The Empire to which South Africa belonged was involved\r\nin one of the greatest and cruelest wars which had ever befallen humanity.\r\nGeneral Botha continued:\r\n\r\nThe Government, after careful consideration, had decided to comply\r\nwith the request in the interests of South Africa as well as of the Empire.\r\n(Cheers.)  There could only be one reply to the Imperial Government's request.\r\nThere were many in South Africa who did not recognize\r\nthe tremendous seriousness and great possibilities of this war,\r\nand some thought that the storm did not threaten South Africa.\r\nThis was a most narrow-minded conception.  The Empire was at war;\r\nconsequently South Africa was at war with the common enemy.  (Cheers.)\r\nOnly two paths were open -- the path of faithfulness to duty and honour\r\n-- (cheers) -- and the path of disloyalty and dishonour.\r\nA characteristic of the South African people was their high sense of honour,\r\nand they would maintain their reputation for honourable dealing untarnished.\r\n(Cheers.)  To forget their loyalty to the Empire in this hour of trial\r\nwould be scandalous and shameful, and would blacken South Africa\r\nin the eyes of the whole world.  Of this South Africans were incapable. . . .\r\n\r\nWith regard to the operations in South-West Africa, General Botha declared\r\nthat there could be only one response to the Imperial Government's wishes\r\nunless they wished to contemplate a situation much more serious\r\nthan that which now confronted them.  The mode of operations\r\ncould not be discussed in the House; it must be left\r\nto the commander of the Union forces.*  The Government had summoned Parliament\r\nso that the representatives of the people should know exactly\r\nwhat had happened.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* General Beyers.\r\n--\r\n\r\nHe wished them to understand the seriousness of the position,\r\nand to accept the responsibility which they would be called upon to accept.\r\nHe placed himself with confidence in the hands of the House.\r\nGeneral Botha detailed the German entry into Union territory at Nakob.\r\nThis force was entrenched in kopjes in Union territory at the present time.\r\nHe also described an affair at Schuitdrift in August.  In addition to this,\r\narmed German forces were on the Union frontier in large numbers\r\nbefore there was any question of Union mobilization.  The Premier said\r\nhe quoted the foregoing to show the hostile attitude adopted by Germans\r\nin the neighbouring territory.\r\n\r\nHe next referred to the White Paper on the diplomatic proceedings\r\non the eve of war.  These documents, he declared, showed that\r\nif ever Great Britain entered upon a war with clean hands it was this war.\r\nIt was abundantly clear that Great Britain did not want war,\r\nand did her utmost to maintain peace; but war was forced upon them.\r\nOnly when it became impossible, without loss of prestige and honour,\r\nto remain out of war did the Imperial Government take that supreme step.\r\n(Cheers.)  By the Imperial Government's decision the whole Empire\r\nwas involved in the war.  (Cheers.)  He emphasized that the war\r\nwas not a war of aggrandisement or for the acquisition of land,\r\nbut that it was undertaken out of a sense of duty and in discharge of\r\nsolemn treaty obligations to defend other nations who were\r\nbeing trampled upon, and whose territory was being violated.\r\nHe wished the House to realize that South Africa's future was being decided\r\non the battlefields of Europe. . . .\r\n\r\nHe appealed to South Africans to be tolerant with each other\r\nat the present time.  No one could blame the Dutch South African\r\nwho did not feel exactly as the British South African felt.\r\nIt did not follow that Dutch South Africans were disloyal.\r\nThere was no question of disloyalty.  Although there might be many\r\nwho in the past had been hostile towards the British flag,\r\nhe could vouch for it that they would ten times rather be\r\nunder the British flag than under the German flag.\r\n\r\nGreat confidence had been reposed in the people of South Africa.\r\nThey had received a constitution under which they could create\r\na great nationality.  Great Britain had given them this constitution,\r\nand ever since had regarded them as a free people and as a sister State.\r\nAs an example of how the Imperial Government treated them,\r\nGeneral Botha said that last July the Union Government wanted to raise\r\na loan of 4,000,000 Pounds.  They had raised only two millions.\r\nAs things were it would be fatal to go into the money market just now,\r\nso the Imperial Government had now come to the assistance\r\nof the Union Government and had lent the Union 7,000,000 Pounds.\r\n(Loud cheers.)  That was the spirit of co-operation and brotherhood\r\nwhich invariably animated the Imperial towards the Union Government.\r\nNotwithstanding its own difficulties, the Imperial Government had come forward\r\nand helped the Union Government out of its embarrassment.  (Cheers.)\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Premier said he felt it was the duty of South Africa\r\nto assist in relieving the sufferings and privations inflicted by the war.\r\nThe Government therefore proposed to offer South African products\r\nlike mealies and tobacco for the soldiers, and brandy for medical purposes.\r\nThe farmers had already come forward with offers of products,\r\nand the Government would undertake their dispatch.  General Botha indicated\r\nthat the matter would be dealt with more fully later, and closed his speech\r\nwith an eloquent expression of his belief that South Africa\r\nwould acquit herself honourably in the eyes of the world.\r\n\r\n                               Opposition Views\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Smartt, Leader of the Opposition, said the message\r\nwhich the Prime Minister by his speech had given to the Home Country\r\nwould send a thrill of pride through the Empire -- a thrill of pride\r\nat knowing that in the day of danger South Africa had\r\nbeen true to her trust and had remembered her obligations\r\nas well as her privileges of free citizenship.  (Cheers.)\r\n\r\nMr. Cresswell, the Labour Leader, urged that an expedition should be sent\r\nto fight side by side with the Allies on the Continent.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hertzog said that General Botha's motion had come as a great surprise,\r\nand moved the adjournment.  Other members supported General Hertzog,\r\nbut the motion for the adjournment was rejected by 85 votes to 12.\r\n==\r\n\r\nAfter this short session of Parliament, enthusiastic meetings were held\r\nthroughout the country.  Those in the cities were mainly attended\r\nby citizens of English descent.  Strong resolutions of confidence\r\nin the Union Government, and of approval in the proposed expedition\r\nto German South-West Africa, were passed at these meetings.\r\nAt country meetings, however, the enthusiasm was in the opposite direction.\r\nThere, the resolutions condemned the Government's military policy,\r\nand General Botha was roundly accused of not taking the country\r\ninto his confidence.  When the loyalists urged that the Parliamentary\r\nrepresentatives of the critics, who, by the way, enjoy manhood suffrage,\r\nhad authorized the Government policy, the growlers replied that their members\r\ndid not consult their wishes.\r\n\r\nGeneral Botha made it as plain as the Dutch language could put it\r\nthat the Germans had been in camp near Nakob in their own territory.\r\nThat they left their Nakob base on the German side of the Border and came over\r\nto the Union territory for water, and proceeded to entrench themselves\r\namongst the ridges and kopjes which commanded the water-holes,\r\nand that in addition to the duty of the Union as part of the Empire,\r\nthis military trespass on the part of the German forces further strengthened\r\nthe case for an expedition into German South-West Africa.\r\n\r\nAt these Backveld meetings the story about the Germans crossing the border\r\nwas characterized as a bit of ministerial concoction.\r\nClever geographical students, who mounted the platforms\r\nwith maps in their hands, were reported to have demonstrated\r\nto the satisfaction of their auditors that the new map\r\nshowing the German position was falsified by the railway surveyors\r\nand that Nakob Sued was clearly depicted in the old maps\r\nas laying in German territory.  The Dutch reporters, however,\r\ndo not state that the ridges and kopjes referred to by General Botha\r\nwere also stated to be on the German side of the line\r\naccording to the old maps.  So that the position was like this:\r\nat first the Boers would not sanction an expedition against the Germans\r\nuntil the latter invaded Union territory, and when the Government proved\r\nby means of police reports that the Germans had actually crossed\r\ninto Union territory the critics accused the Ministry of telling untruths.\r\nThis, then, must have been the cause of so much delay in mobilization,\r\nand which Ministers had to contend against.  It must be added, however,\r\nthat most of the meetings mentioned took place in Transvaal.\r\nAt the Cape the discontent was almost insignificant, whilst as much of it\r\nas had existed promptly ranged itself on the side of the Government\r\nwhen the \"Free\" State and Transvaal hoisted the standard of rebellion.\r\n\r\nMatters went ahead somewhat after the meeting of Parliament.\r\nBut a rude awakening awaited the people of the Union, if not\r\nthe peoples of the Empire, when they got up one September morning and read\r\nthe following correspondence relating to the resignation of General Beyers,\r\nthe head of the Union forces: --\r\n\r\n==\r\n                    GENERAL BEYER'S EXTRAORDINARY ATTITUDE\r\n\r\n          Ex-General Beyers to General Smuts\r\n                              Pretoria,\r\n                                   September 15, 1914.\r\n\r\nHonourable Sir, --  You are aware that during the month of August last\r\nI told you and General Botha by word of mouth that I discovered\r\nthe sending of commandos to German South-West Africa for the purpose\r\nof conquering that territory.  I was on the point then of resigning,\r\nbut hearing that Parliament would be called together I decided to wait,\r\nhoping a way out of the difficulty would be found.  To my utmost surprise,\r\nhowever, Parliament confirmed the resolution adopted by the Government --\r\nnamely, to conquer German South-West Africa, without any provocation\r\nto the Union from the Germans.  The Government must be aware\r\nthat by far the great majority of the Dutch-speaking people of the Union\r\ndecidedly disapproved of our crossing the frontier,\r\nand that two conferences of commandants recently held at Pretoria\r\nbore eloquent testimony to this.  I challenge the Government\r\nby an appeal to the people, without making use of compulsion,\r\nto obtain another result.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Great Britain has taken part in the war\r\nfor the sake of right and justice, in order to protect\r\nthe independence of smaller nations, and to comply with treaties,\r\nbut the fact that three Ministers of the British Cabinet have resigned\r\nshows that even in England there is a strong minority\r\nwho cannot be convinced of the righteousness of a war with Germany.\r\nHistory teaches us, after all, that whenever it suits her interests,\r\nGreat Britain is always ready to protect smaller nations,\r\nbut unhappily history also relates instances in which the sacred rights\r\nof independence of smaller nations have been violated and treaties disregarded\r\nby that same Empire.  In proof of this I have only to indicate\r\nhow the independence of the South African Republic and Orange Free State\r\nwas violated, and of what weight the Sand River Convention was.\r\nIt is said that war is being waged against the barbarity of the Germans.\r\nI have forgiven, but not forgotten, all the barbarities\r\nperpetrated in this our own country during the South African war.\r\nWith very few exceptions, all farms, not to mention many towns,\r\nwere so many Louvains, of which we now hear so much.\r\n\r\nAt this critical moment it is made known in Parliament that our Government\r\nwas granted a loan of 7,000,000 Pounds by the British Government.\r\nThis is very significant.  Any one can have his own thoughts about this.\r\nIn the absence of legitimate grounds for the annexation policy\r\nof the Government you endeavour to intimidate the public by declaring\r\nthat the Government are in possession of information showing that Germany\r\nhas decided, should the opportunity arise, to annex South Africa.\r\nMy humble opinion is that this will be hastened if from our side\r\nwe invade German territory without having been provoked thereto\r\nby the Germans, and as to the alleged German annexation scheme,\r\nthis is nothing more than the result of the usual native suspicion\r\nattending such matters.  The allegations made in Parliament\r\n-- namely, that the Germans have already violated our frontier --\r\nare ungrounded.  See the report of the Information Bureau, corroborated by\r\nColonel Maritz* and his officers, who are on and near the frontier.\r\nApparently the Government longed for some transgression by\r\nthe Germans of German South-West Africa, and have been disappointed in this,\r\nfor so far not a single German soldier has crossed our frontier,\r\nas you know very well.  The report is perfectly correct regarding\r\nan involuntary transgression of the frontier some time ago\r\nand the tendering of an apology for so doing.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* Maritz was at this time on active service, nominally as a Colonel\r\n  at the head of a British regiment, but in reality as a General\r\n  in the German Army, using British arms, stores, railways, and telegrams\r\n  in the service of the Kaiser.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhatever may happen in South Africa, the war will be decided in Europe\r\nin any case, so if Germany triumphs and should decide to attack us,\r\nthen even Great Britain would be unable to help us.  We shall at least\r\nhave a sacred and clean cause in defending our country to the utmost\r\nprovided we stay inside our borders.  Meanwhile, in case we are attacked,\r\nour people will arise as one man in defence for its rights.\r\nBesides, I am convinced that a commando of about 8,000 Germans,\r\nas at present stationed in German territory, will not be so foolish\r\nas to attempt an attack on our country.  I have always said,\r\nand represented at Booysens recently, that if the Union is attacked\r\nBoer and Briton will defend this country side by side,\r\nand in such case I will deem it a great honour and privilege\r\nto take up my place at the head of our forces in defence of my fatherland.\r\nI accepted the post of Commander-General under our Defence Act,\r\nthe first section of which provides that our forces can only be employed\r\nin defence of the Union.  My humble opinion is that this section cannot\r\nthus be changed by informal resolution of Parliament, such being contrary\r\nto Parliamentary procedure.  So the Defence Act does not allow us\r\nto go and fight the enemy over the frontier, and to light the fire\r\nin this way.  But should the enemy penetrate into our country\r\nit will be our duty to drive him back and pursue him in his own territory.\r\n\r\nIn his speech General Botha speaks about the help we had\r\nfrom the Belgians and French after the South African War.\r\nThat assistance is still appreciated by us and by all our people,\r\nbut we must not forget that the Germans also were not behindhand,\r\nand have always been well-disposed towards us.  So why should we\r\ndeliberately make enemies of them?  As circumstances are,\r\nand seeing no way of taking the offensive, and as I sincerely love\r\nmy country and people, I must strongly protest against\r\nthe sending of Union citizen forces over the frontier.  Who can foretell\r\nwhen the fire the Government has decided to light shall end?\r\nFor the reasons enumerated above I feel constrained to resign\r\nmy post as Commandant-General, as also my commissioned rank.\r\nFor me this is the only way of faith, duty, and honour towards our people,\r\nof which mention was made by General Botha.  I have always tried to do my duty\r\nto my best convictions, and it sorely grieves me that it must end in this way.\r\n\r\n                    I remain, etc.,\r\n                         (Signed)  C. L. Beyers.\r\n==\r\n\r\n==\r\n          General Smuts to Ex-General Beyers\r\n                              Pretoria,\r\n                                   September 19, 1914.\r\n\r\nSir, --  It was with regret that I received your letter of the 15th inst.\r\ntendering your resignation as Commandant-General of the Union Defence Forces\r\nand as officer of the Union.  The circumstances under which\r\nthe resignation took place and the terms in which you endeavour\r\nto justify your action tend to leave a very painful impression.\r\nIt is true that it was known to me that you entered objections\r\nagainst war operations in German South-West Africa, but I never received\r\nthe impression that you would resign.  On the contrary,\r\nall information in the possession of the Government was communicated to you,\r\nall plans were discussed with you, and your advice was followed\r\nto a large extent.  The principal officers were appointed\r\non your recommendation and with your concurrence, and the plan of operations\r\nwhich is now being followed is largely the one recommended by yourself\r\nat a conference of officers.  My last instructions to you\r\nbefore I left for Capetown to attend the special session of Parliament were\r\nthat in my absence you should visit certain regiments on the German border,\r\nand it was well understood between us that immediately the war operations\r\nwere somewhat further advanced and co-operation among the various divisions\r\nwould be practicable you should yourself undertake the chief command\r\nin German South West Africa.  The attitude of the Government after this\r\nremained unchanged, and was approved by Parliament after full discussion.\r\n\r\nOne would have expected that that approval would make the matter\r\neasier for you, but now I find that you anticipated that Parliament\r\nwould disapprove the policy of the Government, and that\r\nyour disappointment in this became the reason for your unexpected action.\r\nIn order to make your motives clearer the reasons for your resignation\r\nwere explained in a long political argument which was immediately\r\ncommunicated to the Press and came into the hands of the Government\r\nlong after publication.  I need not tell you that all these circumstances\r\nin connexion with your resignation have made a most unpleasant impression\r\non my colleagues and myself.\r\n\r\nBut this unpleasant impression has even been aggravated by the allegations\r\ncontained in your letter.  Your bitter attack on Great Britain\r\nis not only baseless, but is the more unjustifiable coming as it does,\r\nin the midst of a great war, from the Commandant-General\r\nof one of the British Dominions.  Your reference to barbarous acts\r\nduring the South African War cannot justify the criminal\r\ndevastation of Belgium, and can only be calculated to sow hatred and division\r\namong the people of South Africa.  You forget to mention\r\nthat since the South African War the British people gave South Africa\r\nher entire freedom, under a Constitution which makes it possible for us\r\nto realize our national ideals along our own lines, and which, for instance,\r\nallows you to write with impunity a letter for which you would,\r\nwithout doubt, be liable in the German Empire to the extreme penalty.\r\nAs regards your other statements, they have been answered and disposed of\r\nin Parliament.  From these discussions it will be apparent that neither\r\nthe British Empire nor South Africa was the aggressor in this struggle.\r\nWar was, in the first instance, declared by Austria-Hungary,\r\nand thereafter by Germany, under circumstances in which the British Government\r\nemployed its utmost powers to maintain the peace of Europe and to safeguard\r\nthe neutrality of Belgium.  So far as we ourselves are concerned,\r\nour coast is threatened, our mail-boats are arrested, and our borders\r\nare invaded by the enemy.  This latter does not occur, as you say,\r\nin an involuntary manner and with an apology, which latter, at any rate,\r\nwas never tendered to our Government.  Under these circumstances\r\nit is absurd to speak about aggressive action on the part of the Union,\r\nseeing that together with the British Empire we have been drawn,\r\nagainst our wish and will and entirely in self-defence, into this war.\r\nAs regards your insinuation concerning the loan of seven million pounds\r\nwhich the British Government was kind enough to grant us,\r\nand for which the public of the Union, as evidenced recently\r\nin Parliament, are most grateful it is of such a despicable nature\r\nthat there is no necessity to make any comment thereon.\r\nIt only shows to what extent your mind has been obscured by political bias.\r\nYou speak about duty and honour.  My conviction is that\r\nthe people of South Africa will in these dark days, when the Government,\r\nas well as the people of South Africa, are put to the supreme test,\r\nhave a clearer conception of duty and honour than is to be deduced\r\nfrom your letter and action.  For the Dutch-speaking section in particular\r\nI cannot conceive anything more fatal and humiliating\r\nthan a policy of lip-loyalty in fair weather and of a policy\r\nof neutrality and pro-German sentiment in days of storm and stress.\r\nIt may be that our peculiar internal circumstances and our backward condition\r\nafter the great war will place a limit on what we can do,\r\nbut nevertheless I am convinced the people will support the Government\r\nin carrying out the mandate of Parliament, and in this manner, which is\r\nthe only legitimate one, fulfil their duty to South Africa and to the Empire\r\nand maintain their dearly won honour unblemished for the future.\r\nYour resignation is hereby accepted.\r\n\r\n                         (Signed)  J. C. Smuts.\r\n==\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out, the Natives of South Africa, who, in many instances,\r\nare much better in touch with the backvelders than the Dutch editors\r\nwho reside in towns, fully expected a general revolt among\r\nthe unofficial section of the Boers.  But when Holland declared her neutrality\r\nthe Natives began to breathe more freely, as that declaration\r\nled them to believe that the Boers would not now rise.\r\nWhen General Beyers's resignation was published, however,\r\nthe Natives again felt that the outbreak was only a matter of days.\r\nIn the country, especially the Orange \"Free\" State, our people\r\nare helplessly mixed up with the Boers, and it can readily be understood\r\nthat they felt somewhat insecure, notwithstanding the Government's assurances.\r\nOne native farmer sent the following letter to the author in England: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nI am glad to find that your newspaper, the `Tsala ea Batho', is as up to date\r\nin your absence as when you are at home.  It was the first to publish\r\nGeneral Botha's statement to the Natives (about the war), and again the first\r\nto comment on the treacherous resignation of General Beyers.\r\nThe resignation was handed to the Government on the 15th,\r\nand the `Tsala' commented on it on September 19, before the daily papers.\r\nI think that the daily papers were still trying to reconcile\r\ntheir previous articles about the loyalty of ALL WHITE SOUTH AFRICANS with\r\nthe resignation.  The fact that General De la Rey was shot while travelling\r\nin the same car with General Beyers on the same day that Beyers resigned\r\nis cited as a further proof of the unswerving loyalty of all the Boers.\r\nOne cannot understand how these white folks reason;\r\nbut the attitude of the Imperial Government and of the Union Government\r\nis incomprehensible.  Fancy telling the loyal Rhodesians to come and fight\r\nunder a man like that!  General Botha ought himself to go to the front,\r\nif a civil war is to be averted, leaving General Smuts\r\nto watch the next Dutch move and nip it in the bud.\r\n==\r\n\r\nOne of the tragedies of the first few weeks of the war\r\nwas the death of Senator General De la Rey of Lichtenburg,\r\nwho was accidentally shot by a \"Rand\" policeman on the night of September 15,\r\nwhile travelling with General Beyers in a motor-car.\r\n\r\nHis funeral took place on September 20, at Lichtenburg, and was attended\r\nby a large number of Boers, including the Prime Minister, General Smuts,\r\nGeneral De Wet, and other Dutch generals.  Mourners and their friends\r\ncame to Lichtenburg by the ordinary train and by the special train\r\nwhich conveyed the body from the Rand.  They came in all manner of vehicles\r\nfrom the surrounding farms, and, for the first time,\r\nthe Dutch Reformed Church at Lichtenburg opened its doors to the blacks,\r\nwho came to pay their last respects to, and view the body of, a popular Boer,\r\nknown among the Bechuana as Koos La Rey.  A commando of 400 Burghers\r\ncame from Wolmaranstad on horseback.  English merchants\r\nfrom Johannesburg were also present, including Senator Tucker,\r\nrepresenting the Unionist party.  The body was draped WITH TWO FLAGS --\r\nthe flag of the old Transvaal Republic and of the old \"Free\" State Republic.\r\nBesides the officiating clergy, three Dutch statesmen also spoke\r\nat the funeral service, viz., Generals Botha, Beyers, and De Wet.\r\n\r\nThe loyalists returned from the funeral service to their path of duty,\r\nwhile the sullen section of the Dutch remained at Lichtenburg\r\nto fan the embers of rebellion -- though it must be added\r\nthat the operations at Lichtenburg were more or less in camera.\r\n\r\nAt 8 o'clock on Monday morning, September 21, the day after\r\nGeneral De la Rey's funeral, General Kemp, standing on\r\nGeneral Beyer's motor-car, presided over a gathering of\r\nfrom 800 to 1,000 Boers.  The Rev. Mr. Broeckhuizen opened the meeting\r\nwith a short prayer.  A verbatim report of this prayer appeared\r\nin the Dutch papers as follows:  \"Lord, we thank Thee\r\nthat Thou rulest our nation through these dark days and stormy circumstances.\r\nWe have buried our hero and have gathered to speak in his spirit.\r\nWe thank Thee for such a man as General Beyers, beside whom\r\nhis friend was shot.  We thank Thee also for General De Wet and General Kemp,\r\nand that Thou hast given us such men to lead us.  We stand for our people.\r\nHelp us, O Lord, towards the salvation of our people and the salvation\r\nof our fatherland.  Amen.\"\r\n\r\nThe three personalities mentioned in this prayer became active participants\r\nin the rebellion, and so did the reverend gentleman who prayed.\r\nIn fact the latter sent a letter to his congregation three months later\r\nfrom the Johannesburg prison, resigning his pastorate at Pretoria.\r\n\r\nIn opening the meeting the chairman disclaimed all ideas about a revolution.\r\nThey had come to consider calmly a decision by the Union Parliament\r\nto invade German South West Africa; but while he was speaking,\r\nsome one produced a flag of the old Free State Republic,\r\nand General Kemp rebuked the person for this puerile action.\r\nWhether the rebuke was due to the fact that the Boers\r\nhad not yet then made up their minds to rebel, or because Maritz's plans\r\nwith the Germans on the south-western frontier had not yet matured,\r\nwe do not know.  Anyway, General Beyers, in supporting the chairman,\r\nadded that his cause was a clean one and there was no necessity\r\nfor nonsensical flag-waving.  They were there, he said,\r\nto pass a calm resolution and forward it to the Government.\r\n\r\nOne Mr. van der Hoff inquired why General Beyers resigned.\r\nThe chairman replied that the reasons were clearly set forth\r\nin the letter of resignation.  At the request of the gathering\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Broeckhuizen read the letter aloud, the reading throughout\r\nbeing punctuated with cheers.  It does not appear, however,\r\nthat General Smuts's reply was also read, presumably because\r\nthere was no call for it.\r\n\r\nGeneral Liebenberg wanted to know what the situation was that morning;\r\nthen he proceeded to say:  \"The enemy is already inside our borders.\r\nSome one had disturbed a beehive and the result is what\r\nmight have been expected.  We have three generals before us\"\r\n-- (apparently in addition to the speaker) -- \"yesterday we buried\r\nthe dearest of them all.  I want a reply from Generals De Wet and Beyers.\r\nWe are British subjects, and it is not improbable that the Government\r\nmight instruct their officers to call us out to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral De Wet, the man of the hour, then stepped on to the motor-car\r\nto speak, prefacing his speech with the remark that he could not help\r\nremembering his brother buried the previous day.  Then, in beginning\r\nhis speech, he said:  \"Burghers and Brethren, --  If there be any one present\r\nwho is not a brother, let him walk away.  Since nobody is leaving\r\nI conclude that we are brothers all.  If there be any stepbrothers here,\r\nthey are all welcome, but a traitor always reminds me of Judas.\"\r\nProceeding, he said that \"the Germans had been made enemies by the Government.\r\nThe fire was already burning, so let us adopt a calm resolution,\r\nexpressing the will of the people.  Not that I wish to praise my people,\r\nbut we are not going to soil our hands, no not even to show our loyalty.\r\nLet us be cool, remembering that we have many sympathizers\r\nin South Africa and elsewhere.  If any one wished to gnash his teeth\r\nand hath no teeth his best course is to consult the dentist for a set.\r\nBetter an hour too late than a minute too early.  We do not all reside\r\nnear a telephone or a telegraph office and cannot be conversant with\r\nwhat goes on at the frontier.  Even when Generals Beyers and Kemp are asleep,\r\nkeep a watch and remain cool.  I believe there are numerous Christians\r\namong us.  When it is time the whole of the people will rise up like to-day.\"\r\n\r\nSome one wished to know if it was possible to recall the forces\r\nalready at the border.  That, said the chairman, would be decided later.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. de Klerk said General Beyers's letter translated\r\nthe real feeling of the people.  Even though Generals Beyers, Kemp, and De Wet\r\nhad resigned, they still remained Generals.  They honoured other officers\r\nwho had the pluck to resign with General Beyers (whose names the Government\r\nhad not published but had suppressed), including Lieutenant Kol Bezuidenhout.\r\nOne Field Cornet to the speaker's knowledge had resigned,\r\nbut his name had not been announced.\"  The reverend gentleman\r\nthen betrayed his flagrant ignorance of South African history when he said:\r\n\"Our people were never known to have robbed any one of land.\r\nAll (?) their land had been acquired by means of purchase or barter.\r\nThe history of South Africa was a spotless one.\"  After stating\r\nthat the Afrikander must express his disdain with respect to\r\nthe Jameson raid and the unrighteous annexation of the Republics,\r\nhe concluded:  \"Blood is flowing in Belgium, but is it\r\nin the interest of South Africa to draw the sword on that account?\r\nIt may be in the interests of the Empire; but the hem of my coat\r\nis nearer to my body than the coat itself.  The sending of troops\r\nto Damaraland is nothing but an attack upon a people that had done us no harm.\r\nI believe it to be our duty to sit still.\"\r\n\r\nRev. Mr. Van der Merwe, who said he spoke on behalf of the young people,\r\nsaid all their officers should resign like General Beyers and others.\r\nHe hoped that any officers present would resign before noon that day.\r\n\r\nGeneral De Wet pointed out that the appointment of any Jack, Tom, and Harry\r\nmight follow such wholesale resignations, for although he lived in\r\nthe \"Free\" State he held a share in the affairs of that (Transvaal) Province.\r\n\r\nGeneral Beyers:  \"I consider my own resignation a sufficient protest.\r\nThe other representatives of our people should remain at their posts.\"\r\n(Cries of \"No, no, no.\")\r\n\r\nRev. Mr. Broeckhuizen implored the people to stand by\r\ntheir Commander-in-Chief, General Beyers, as he himself was going to do,\r\nno matter how barking lap-dogs raved.  Despite any letters\r\nthat some fellows might write to the papers to the contrary,\r\nthe world must know that the people stood behind General Beyers.\r\nAlthough he was still going to suffer -- (as he truly did) --\r\nthey should support him till everything was in order.\r\n\r\nAs a parting shot General Liebenberg said:  When peace was declared in 1902\r\nhe had such implicit faith in the late General De la Rey\r\nthat he (General Liebenberg) remained quietly on his farm and was always\r\nobedient to him.  He expected these troubles since 1912.\r\nAnd now it had become impossible to keep quiet much longer.\r\nAccording to the latest accounts the Germans were 150 miles\r\nacross the boundary.  (A voice:  \"We will beat them back.\")\r\n\r\nThe speaker:  \"The same thing was said when they were in Belgium,\r\nbut they are now marching on Paris.\"\r\n\r\nA revised resolution was then put:  it declared the reported\r\naction of the Government to be \"in conflict with --\r\n\r\n\"1.  The wishes of the overwhelming majority of the population of the Union.\"\r\n(An extravagant assertion considering that there are six million\r\npeople in the Union and that the meeting only represented\r\na section of the half a million Boers.)\r\n\r\nA reply was demanded from the Government before September 30, so as to get it\r\nin time for consideration at a subsequent people's gathering.\r\n\r\nWhen this was carried, General De Wet said in parting:  \"If there be still\r\na few lap-dogs here, friends, don't take any notice of them.\r\nThey have now no teeth.  We are now more united than when\r\nthe difference between the Government and `the People' first began.\"\r\n(Obviously General De Wet was here alluding to the rupture\r\nbetween the Government and General Hertzog in 1912, when,\r\nto the disgust of himself and his followers, the latter was forced\r\nto leave the Ministry.  One reason why the Natives' Land Act was passed\r\nwas in order to \"dish the Whigs\" and placate the Hertzogites.)\r\n\r\n     *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nOn September 24, General De Wet held another meeting at Kopjes,\r\nOrange \"Free\" State.  The Resident Magistrate of Parys\r\nattended the meeting and read a telegram from the Government\r\nannouncing that no Burghers would be forced to proceed to the front;\r\nthat only volunteers would be asked to serve.  This wire, however,\r\ndid not satisfy the Burghers.  They contended that the expedition\r\nto German South-West Africa was a policy of setting the prairie on fire,\r\nand it did not matter who the originator of the fire was,\r\nfor when it was raging the Burghers would be called upon to quench it.\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting had passed votes of condolences to Mrs. De la Rey,\r\nGeneral De Wet said he was opposed to a war against a nation\r\nthat had done him no harm.  Whether or not the Government used volunteers,\r\n\"who,\" he asked, \"would be responsible for the harm that is likely to follow\r\na provocation of the Germans?  This expedition is to coax them\r\ninto our country.  You may go if you like,\" added General De Wet emphatically,\r\n\"but I won't.\"\r\n\r\nNow, the Boers in certain respects are not unlike the Natives; thus when\r\na grey-haired Native, or a Boer, addresses a crowd of his compatriots\r\nand says to them, \"You may do such and such a thing if you like,\r\nbut I will not,\" it is understood by them to be a roundabout way of saying,\r\n\"Take my advice and don't.\"  And so when such a declaration is made\r\nby a man as influential amongst his people as General De Wet,\r\nit is not surprising that the crowd shouted in response, \"We won't go.\r\nLet the authorities adjust the result of their own bungling.\r\nNinety-two men in Parliament voted for the expedition\r\nwithout consulting their constituents, and we are not satisfied.\"\r\nThereupon some one shouted, \"Where is Mr. Van der Merwe?\"\r\nOthers said, \"Call him; perhaps he is in the crowd.\"\r\nSo the stentorian voice of a Boer equipped with a powerful pair of lungs\r\ncalled out, \"Van der Merwe!  Van der Merwe!!  Van der Merwe!!!\"\r\nand then announced \"He is not here.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Van der Merwe is the Parliamentary representative of the district\r\nwhere the meeting was held.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, General De Wet said:  \"Here is the Magistrate\r\nand there is the prison.  If I have said anything that I cannot substantiate\r\nI will willingly surrender myself into their hands.\"\r\n\r\nThe motion against the expedition was then put, 512 Boers voting for it\r\nand only two against it.\r\n\r\n     *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\n    Es ist sehr weit nach Tipperary,\r\n        Es ist sehr weit zu gehn;\r\n    Es ist sehr weit nach Tipperary,\r\n     Meinen liebsten Schatz zu sehn.\r\n        Leb' wohl, Piccadilly,\r\n        Adieu, Leicester Square,\r\n    Es ist sehr sehr weit nach Tipperary\r\n     Doch dahin sehnt mich sehr.\r\n                             \"Tipperary\" in German.\r\n\r\nOn September 29, General Botha addressed his constituents\r\nat a Transvaal station called Bank, on the Kimberley-Johannesburg line.\r\nA thousand Burghers met the Premier as he left his special travelling saloon\r\nfor the place of the meeting and gave him a rousing reception.\r\nBefore General Botha spoke, he permitted his opponents\r\n(to the evident displeasure of the majority of the audience)\r\nto unbosom their alleged grievance.  Appreciative addresses were read\r\nexpressing confidence in the Government and approval of the expedition\r\nto German South West Africa.  Addresses opposing the expedition\r\nwere also read; they included one that was said to be a petition\r\nfrom Boer women, strongly objecting to the expedition.\r\nThe reading of these addresses took up much time and must have tried\r\nthe patience of the Premier's admirers who were anxious to hear\r\nthe speech of the day.  They called on the readers to \"Shut up!\"\r\nbut the Prime Minister urged them to give both sides a chance.\r\n\r\nAfter these lengthy preliminaries, the Prime Minister amid cheers delivered\r\na speech justifying the projected invasion of German South West Africa,\r\nin obedience to the desire of the Imperial Government.  He reminded the Boers\r\nthat the expedition had been voted for by a Parliament elected by them.\r\nHe added that he personally would always lead his people\r\nalong the white man's path of honour and Christianity,\r\nand that he would never choose the coward's way of disloyalty and treason.\r\nThe whole of the speech might be summed up in a few lines\r\ntaken out of General Smuts's reply to General Beyers:  \"I cannot conceive\r\nanything more fatal and humiliating than a policy of lip-loyalty\r\nin fair weather and a policy of neutrality and pro-German sentiment\r\nin days of storm and stress.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister further asked what reliance could be placed\r\non Germany who ravaged Belgium.  He pointed out that when\r\nthe late President Kruger arrived in Europe -- a fugitive from his country --\r\nthe French and the Belgians welcomed him, while the Kaiser\r\nwould not even see the old man.\r\n\r\nGeneral Botha made some remarks at this meeting which displeased\r\nthe coloured loyalists.  Without wishing to defend the Premier, the remark,\r\nin our opinion, was justifiable.  It was more of a recruiting speech\r\nthan a declaration of policy, and naturally he had to appeal\r\nto the sentiments of his hearers.  Nothing goes down so easily\r\nwith the northern Boers as colour prejudice, and in the circumstances\r\nGeneral Botha was justified in denouncing the neutrality party, who advocated\r\na policy of \"sitting with folded arms until German South West Africa\r\nfell into their lap like a ripe apple.  The Imperial Government,\"\r\nhe went on to say, \"could send a force of 50,000 coolies*\r\nto capture the German Colony, and tell them that, after the war,\r\nthey could make a coolie settlement there.  Would this have been\r\nin the interest of the country?  (Cries of No, no.)  But instead,\r\nthe Imperial Government had asked the Union to do the work,\r\nand I am proud to have been asked.\"\r\n\r\n--\r\n* A contemptuous term for British Indians.\r\n--\r\n\r\nNor could Englishmen, having regard to the circumstances,\r\nvery well take umbrage at another remark of General Botha's\r\nin the same speech.  It was, we believe, a clever appeal\r\nto the feelings of Backvelders when he said:  \"Can you rely\r\non the Kaiser's promises?  In the South African war, WHEN I GAVE THE ENGLISH\r\nA SOUND THRASHING at Colenso, what did the Kaiser do?\r\nHe sent a telegram to Lord Roberts advising him how to stab me in the back,\r\nby marching across the `Free' State.\"\r\n\r\nThe danger that would follow a German victory in South Africa\r\nwas so lucidly put by the Premier that many waverers were at once imbued\r\nwith the patriotic spirit.  Carping criticism, it is true, continued,\r\nbut many wobbling defence officers resolved to follow General Botha\r\nto the uttermost.  The opposition, on the other hand, told the Boers\r\nthat the official element among them who supported the Government did so,\r\nnot through patriotic motives, but for the sake of their jobs.\r\nThe most credulous section among the Boers seemed to believe that the Germans\r\nwould never invade British South Africa.  This section at first was baffled\r\nby the contention of the neutrality party that the Government was maligning\r\nthe Germans; but they were soon disillusioned.\r\n\r\nOn September 26, Colonel Grant took possession of some water-holes\r\non the line of advance.  This step was essential to\r\nthe success of the proposed expedition.  The enemy retired,\r\nbut only to mount their artillery on some ridges overlooking\r\nthe camp of the advancing British forces.  From those positions\r\nthe enemy shelled our troops till their ammunition was exhausted.\r\nThe British casualties amounted to sixteen killed, forty-three wounded,\r\neight missing, and thirty-five captured.  These figures\r\nwould be insignificant on the battlefields of Europe,\r\nbut to lose so many men in only one attack in South Africa\r\nwas almost appalling.  This reverse having brought home to the waverers\r\nthe danger of procrastination, a fresh spirit set in\r\namong the passive loyalists.  But the opposition was busy.\r\n\r\n     *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nOn the same day that General Botha carried the day at Banks,\r\nCommandant Vermaas addressed over 100 Burghers at a Transvaal farm\r\ncalled Korannafontein.  There were present such notable Dutchmen\r\nas Mr. Sarel Du Plessis and Mr. Cornelius Grobbelaar.\r\nThey were so provocative that Commandant Vermaas asked the meeting\r\nwith some warmth:  \"Who do you believe about the occurrences\r\nat the German frontier, the Government who receive all the police reports,\r\nor General Beyers?  All I can say is that you will weep\r\nwhen General Botha gets shot, for I know what he did for this country.\r\nAnd if you disbelieve the Government, what will be the use of telling you\r\nthat the Germans were the aggressors?\"\r\n\r\nSensible speeches were delivered by Mr. D. Louw and others.\r\nThis speaker deeply regretted the resignation of General Beyers, and said:\r\n\"He had charge of all the Defence secrets and it cost us much money\r\nto let him travel about this country and abroad; and at a critical moment,\r\nwhen we are face to face with trouble he tenders his resignation.\"\r\nThe meeting, however, insisted that the Union Government were the delinquents.\r\nThe Germans, they said, had crossed the border accidentally,\r\nfor which little relapse they had tendered a suitable apology.  Some speakers\r\nsaid that the Ministry's ambitious annexation policy was actuated\r\nby a desire for posthumous fame regardless of the blood of Afrikanders,\r\nwhich was more precious than the deserts of German South West Africa.\r\nThe issue would be decided on the battlefields of Europe,\r\nso why the premature invasion, and why the forgery of the railway map\r\nin respect to the position of Nakob where the German forces are?\r\n\"Supposing the Germans win in Europe,\" asked one of the speakers,\r\n\"what would be our position after the raid?  We prefer to follow\r\nGeneral Beyers.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Commandant Vermaas, the Government emissary, was still speaking,\r\nsome one shouted:  \"Three cheers for General Hertzog!\"\r\nThese were vociferously accorded.\r\n\r\nAt this stage one of the young bloods came out with a brand-new defence\r\nof Germany's desertion of the Boer cause during the South African war.\r\nGermany, he said, had a ten years' treaty with England and could not go to war\r\nagainst the British, who were there again too smart for us.\r\nWhen Queen Wilhelmina was in Germany the Kaiser said to her:\r\n\"Tell the Transvaal not to declare war against England just yet ----.\"\r\n\r\nCommandt. Vermaas:  \"And you call it friendship.  Why promise us help\r\nwhen they had a treaty with England?\"\r\n\r\nAfter some dialogues, in which the Bible was quoted on both sides,\r\nfor and against the expedition, a resolution was adopted, by eighty-nine votes\r\nto twenty-three, against the invasion of German South-West Africa.\r\n\r\nAn aged Dutch gentleman remarked that the late Republican Government\r\nmade a mistake in first sending an ultimatum to the English,\r\nand in attacking German South-West Africa the Union Government was repeating\r\nthe same mistake.\r\n\r\n     *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\n    Oom:   Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\r\n            Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?\r\n\r\n    Neef:  Here were the servants of your adversary\r\n              And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:\r\n           I drew to part them; in the instant came\r\n           The fiery Tielman, who swung about his head\r\n            And breathed defiance in my ears . . .\r\n           While we were interchanging, thrusts and blows\r\n           Came more and more, and fought on part and part\r\n           Till the Judge came, who parted either part.\r\n\r\nAccording to `Het Westen' of Potchefstroom, over a thousand Burghers\r\npacked the Lyric Hall on Friday, October 2, 1914, to hear General De Wet\r\nspeak against the invasion of German South West Africa.\r\nApparently this was an attempt by the Backvelders to challenge\r\nthe enthusiasm of the townspeople in the various centres who had been passing\r\nloyal resolutions in favour of the expedition and of confidence in\r\nthe Union Government.  Not all the supporters of the Backvelders' cause\r\ncould gain admission to the hall, which was packed almost to suffocation\r\nbefore the hour of meeting.  Several prominent \"Free\" Staters\r\nwere on the platform with General De Wet.  A rabble of roughs\r\nhad been brought from the outskirts of the town by opponents of the cause,\r\nso the paper says, to interrupt the proceedings and to create disturbance.\r\nThey waited outside and were \"responsible for a state of things\r\nwhich is wholly unknown in the history of South Africa.\"\r\n\r\nAdmission was by ticket, and everything was in order up to eight o'clock,\r\nwhen Commandant Erasmus took the chair.  General De Wet\r\nwas carried shoulder high into the meeting amid thunderous applause.\r\nThe local police force had had timely notification that the meeting\r\nwas arranged for, but the paper complains that only seven of them\r\nwere to be seen about the building, and these seven apparently were seized\r\nwith a blindness of a mysterious kind, for they saw nothing of the disturbance\r\nthat occurred during the meeting, except when it was thought necessary\r\nto arrest an Afrikander.\r\n\r\nThe chairman having opened the meeting, Professor Duvenage welcomed\r\nthe visitors from near and far, including the ladies in the gallery.\r\nThe professor, alluding to the English meeting which took place\r\nin the town hall a few evenings before, observed it was not interrupted\r\nby any one.  This meeting, he said further, had been called\r\nto discuss the South African aspect of the war.  It had nothing to say\r\nabout the operations in Europe; all that they wished to protest against\r\nwas the invasion of German South West Africa.  Hereupon dead cats, brickbats,\r\nstale eggs and other things were hurled into the hall through the windows,\r\noccasioning an indescribable commotion.  Angry Afrikanders\r\njumped out of the windows and seized some of the offenders and administered\r\nsuch a sound thrashing to one of them that he only escaped serious bodily harm\r\nby lying down.\r\n\r\nThe dead cats, bricks, etc., were picked up and thrown out of the window;\r\nbut, as the interrupted meeting was about to proceed,\r\nsome one disconnected the electric cable and plunged the building in darkness.\r\nThe confusion became confounding.  Matches were struck\r\nin several parts of the hall, and it was with considerable difficulty\r\nGenerals De Wet and Kemp were heard suggesting an adjournment of the meeting\r\nto the Dutch Reformed Church Square.  The crowd passed out of the Lyric Hall\r\nand marched in the direction of the Dutch Reformed Church Square,\r\nclosely followed by the hooting band of interrupters.\r\n\r\nA handy carriage procured from somewhere served as a platform and,\r\nunder the light of Africa's silvery moon, 1,500 Burghers\r\ncrowded round the improvised platform while the turbulent interrupters\r\nscreeched some English national airs.  General Kemp, who warned the crowd\r\nagainst the danger of being struck by missiles, asked them to squat\r\non the ground, so as to be better able to hear General De Wet.\r\nThe guerrilla General, having stepped upon the carriage-platform,\r\nsaid to the audience:  \"Yes, sit down flat so that those disturbance-makers\r\nmay hurl their missiles at me on top of the carriage.  (Laughter.)\r\nSome of those who came to interrupt peaceful Afrikanders\r\nmay yet become children of death before the evening is far gone.\r\n(Boos from the opponents.)\r\n\r\n\"That may be European or Downing Street civilization, but it is unknown\r\nin South Africa; but let us hope that folks with such upbringing will yet live\r\nto change their manners.  Those who are standing against the wire fence\r\nare asked to come nearer and not be afraid, if not, then let them go\r\nto their homes, wherever those may be, and leave us alone.\r\nI promise you that within a year this disrespectful crowd\r\nwill have been taught to respect the rights of Afrikanders.\r\nThat I promise you, and the Afrikander will do it with his own hands.\r\n(Loud cheers.)  If I am wrong in this, there is your jail,\r\nyour police and the Magistrate, and let them punish me if I am guilty.\"\r\n(Voices:  \"They dare not touch you!\").\r\n\r\nProceeding the General went on to refer to an article of the `Volkstem',\r\nthe Ministerial organ of Pretoria.  The `Volkstem', he said\r\n\"had for long been crowing King, King, but the sun will rise\r\nwhen the cock will cease to crow.  (Laughter.)  The Government\r\nhas now issued regulations under which we may not speak, but, friends,\r\nbear in mind, and the `Volkstem' must know, that we have not yet a Popedom,\r\nand we are not yet in Russia, for you will search in vain for the truth\r\nin a newspaper.\" -- (We would very much like to know the opinion hereanent\r\nof the Backveld newspaper organ in which we read of this meeting.  -- Author.)\r\n-- \"Friends, a newspaper can do a lot of harm, and much of the condition\r\nin which our country finds itself may be attributed to the `Volkstem' --\r\nthat Government adulator (`de regeering se vetsmeer' document).\r\n\r\n\"Whereas our people could freely express their views,\r\nthe Government now wants to prevent an expression of their bitter feelings\r\nover the land-robbery now engaged in at German South West.\"\r\n(At this stage, an egg thrown from the back of the crowd\r\nfell uncomfortably near the speaker and aroused some angry remarks\r\nin the crowd, but the speaker continuing said:  \"Never mind, friends,\r\nI have another coat.  The Government talk of calling out volunteers only;\r\nbut many children were surreptitiously torn away from their mothers,\r\nand many were taken against the will of the parents.  I am ready\r\nto bow under the law, but not when it is broken by the Government.\r\nOur law authorizes us to defend our borders, not to wage war outside.\"\r\nAfter some more quarrels, interruptions, blows and fights\r\nin several parts of the crowd, the police arrested a Burgher.\r\nBut some men who surrounded the police rescued the prisoner and, it was said,\r\nassaulted a policeman.)\r\n\r\nProceeding with his speech after the interruption, General De Wet said:\r\n\"We can never thank the English sufficiently for their gift of self-government\r\nunder a free constitution approved by His Majesty the King;\r\nbut it was not implied thereby that we should go and commit a theft.\"\r\nMore interruptions, during which it became impossible for the speaker\r\nto continue.  In the turmoil cheers were given for General De Wet,\r\nwho, resuming at length, remarked:  \"You fellows, along the wire fence,\r\nthe Lord have mercy on you when I turn my back.  You will be responsible\r\nif blood flows in this meeting to-night.  As I have had a better up-bringing\r\nI am keeping the people back from tackling you.  I have not been brought up\r\nin what they call Waaihoek at Bloemfontein.  It was not General Botha's place\r\nto get this country to snatch chestnuts out of the fire for England.\r\nThey bluff us with the statement that the coolies* might be asked\r\nto come and take German South West Africa for themselves.  Well, let it be so.\r\nThey will be in their proper surroundings there amongst the Hottentots.\r\nAnd if it amounts to that, Kafirs armed with assegais can be sent\r\nagainst them, for as it now happens the Kafir has got to work for the coolie\r\nin Natal.\"\r\n\r\n--\r\n* Contemptuous South African term for British Indians.\r\n--\r\n\r\nAfter more disturbances, the General said he was not so certain\r\nthat the police were doing their duty, and he would have to report them\r\nto the Government.  These men were paid out of his pocket and the pockets\r\nof other Burghers, but the people got no protection from them.\r\nAnd when in self-defence an Afrikander remonstrates with the hooligans,\r\nhe is arrested.  He thought there was a Magistrate present,\r\nand can they not get protection?\r\n\r\nAssistant Magistrate Cronin then ascended the carriage and said:\r\n\"I expect you all to give the Burghers a fair opportunity to speak.\"\r\n\r\nConcluding General De Wet said:  \"It was not a question of Hertzog v. Botha.\r\nThe burning point was German South West Africa.  The reason\r\nwhy the people were unarmed was because the Government did not trust them.\r\nThings being so, they should not be surprised that the people\r\nhad no confidence in the authorities.  Many had guns but no cartridges;\r\nhow then could the country be expected to defend itself?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Paul Schutte moved the resolution which was put to the meeting,\r\nprotesting against the expedition to German South West Africa.\r\n\"At this time,\" says the Dutch paper that reported these proceedings,\r\n\"the throats of the interrupters, not being made of steel,\r\nhad become so hoarse and weak that their interruption was ineffective,\r\nexcept, perhaps, when they dealt out blows.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Paul Schutte said, in moving the resolution, that the hand of God\r\nwas pressing heavily on the land:  poverty, misery, and the drought\r\nfinishing the people.  Was it not dangerous for the Government\r\nto embark on such an undertaking without the backing of the unanimous will\r\nof the people?\r\n\r\nMr. Serfontein (presumably one of the two members of Parliament of that name)\r\nsaid he was going to speak the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\r\n\r\nHe said he would give documentary proof that a map has been forged;\r\nhe did not know by whom.  It is said that Nakob is in Union territory,\r\nyet according to the original Government map, that place was\r\non German territory.  \"There is the map,\" he said, apparently flaunting it,\r\n\"satisfy yourselves.\"\r\n\r\nProceeding he said:  \"General Tobias Smuts had declared that he knew\r\nthe Government decision was against the wishes of his constituents,\r\nyet he wanted to support the Government in favour of the war.\r\nGeneral Beyers, who knew all the circumstances, denies that Nakob\r\nis in Union territory.  In these circumstances, how can we, as Christians,\r\nask God to guide us in the undertaking?\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Postma and the Rev. Mr. De Klerk, the two next speakers,\r\nquoted the Bible to show that to proceed against German South West Africa\r\nwas forbidden by Providence.  Mr. Furstenburg, who followed,\r\ncalled on the Burghers to maintain the high character of their people.\r\nAfter a few words of thanks from General Kemp to the audience\r\nfor their attendance, the 1,000 Burghers, amid interruptions,\r\nsignified their objection to the expedition by standing on one side.\r\nThis act closed a most exciting meeting.\r\n\r\nOne of the opponents, the paper says, smacked a Dutch lady on her mouth\r\nand caused it to bleed.  She coolly turned round and gave him\r\nsuch a heavy blow with her fist that he collapsed, saying in\r\nthe purest English accent as she did so:  \"It takes but one woman\r\nto fight a Britisher.\"  Another of the interrupters had to be taken\r\nto the hospital.\r\n\r\nCommandant Els and Mr. Rocco de Villiers, the \"Free\" State lawyer,\r\non their way to the meeting, had a mishap with their motor-car,\r\nfifteen miles distant, so that they reached Potchefstroom on foot,\r\nafter the meeting.\r\n\r\n\"Three cheers for our brown people,\" shouted one of the disturbers.\r\n\"You have forgotten the coolies,\" retorted a Dutch lady.\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting, the opposition formed itself into a procession\r\nand marched through the town.  They also delivered short speeches\r\nconfirming what had been done at a previous meeting of townspeople,\r\nwhich supported the expedition.  They booed General De Wet and his followers,\r\nand dispersed after giving cheers for Generals Botha and Smuts\r\nand singing the National Anthem.\r\n\r\nOne item on the programme of the meeting was an address which\r\nshould have been presented to General Beyers, the ex-Commander-in-Chief,\r\nbut as for some reason or other he was not present, the address\r\nwas sent to him instead.  It congratulated him on his resignation,\r\na step which the signatories were sure he would never regret, as it was\r\nin accord with the peace-loving and the most pious part of his people,\r\nwho resent the \"capture\" of German South West Africa.\r\nFurther, they thanked him for coming to address them and hoped he would\r\ndeliver a speech that would shut the mouths of mischief-makers\r\nwho accused him of being a German agent.\r\n\r\nA similar drama was enacted at Johannesburg during the following week,\r\nwhen General De Wet carried his campaign of protest into\r\nthe stronghold of the sections in favour of the Government expedition.\r\nHis meeting at the Lewis Cinema was only in progress a few minutes\r\nwhen bricks, etc., came through the fanlights, and the lights went out.\r\nThe meeting was adjourned to Church Square, where supporters of the Government\r\ngained the upper hand and overpowered the \"neutral\" party so completely\r\nthat General De Wet, Mr. Serfontein and Rev. Mr. Postma could not be heard.\r\nCheers were continually given for the King, for Generals Botha and Smuts,\r\nand the speeches were drowned by the patriotic airs sung by the throng,\r\nand the meeting proved a complete fiasco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII   The Boer Rebellion\r\n\r\n  Arm, arm, Burghers; we never had more cause!\r\n  The Goths have gathered head; and with a power\r\n  of high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,\r\n  They hither march amain, under conduct\r\n  Of Manie, son to old Gerit Maritz,\r\n  Who threats in course of his revenge, to do\r\n  As much as ever Black Bambata did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following telegram was published by the South African Government: --\r\n\r\n==\r\n                                   October 13, 1914.\r\n\r\nEver since the resignation of General C. F. Beyers as Commandant-General\r\nof the Citizen Force, there have been indications that something was wrong\r\nwith the forces in the north-west of the Cape Province, which were placed\r\nunder the command of Lieutenant-Colonel S. G. Maritz.\r\n\r\nThe Government at once arranged to send Colonel Conraad Brits\r\nto take over the command from Lieutenant-Colonel Maritz.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th instant Colonel Brits sent a message to Maritz\r\nto come in and report to him.  To this message Maritz replied\r\nin a most insolent manner that he was not going to report to anybody.\r\nAll he wanted was his discharge, and Colonel Brits must come himself\r\nand take over his command.\r\n\r\nColonel Brits then sent Major Ben Bouwer to take over the command.\r\n\r\n                                 An Ultimatum\r\n\r\nOn arrival at Maritz's camp, Major Bouwer was taken prisoner\r\nwith his companions, but personally was subsequently released and sent back\r\nwith an ultimatum from Maritz to the Union Government to the effect that:\r\n\r\nUnless the Government guaranteed to him before ten o'clock on Sunday morning,\r\nOctober 11, that they should allow Generals Hertzog, De Wet, Beyers,\r\nKemp, and Muller to meet him where he was, in order that he might receive\r\ninstructions from them, he would forthwith make an attack\r\non General Brits's forces and proceed further to invade the Union.\r\n\r\nMajor Ben Bouwer reported that Maritz was in possession of some guns\r\nbelonging to the Germans, and that he held the rank of General\r\ncommanding the German troops.\r\n\r\nHe had a force of Germans under him in addition to his own rebel commando.\r\n\r\nHe had arrested all those of his officers and men who were unwilling\r\nto join the Germans, and had then sent them forward as prisoners\r\nto German South West Africa.\r\n\r\nMajor Bouwer saw an agreement between Maritz and the Governor\r\nof German South West Africa guaranteeing the independence of the Union\r\nas a republic, ceding Walfish Bay and certain other portions of the Union\r\nto the Germans, and undertaking that the Germans would only invade the Union\r\non the invitation of Maritz.\r\n\r\nMajor Bouwer was shown numerous telegrams and helio messages\r\ndating back to the beginning of September.  Maritz boasted\r\nthat he had ample guns, rifles, ammunition, and money from the Germans,\r\nand that he would overrun the whole of South Africa.\r\n\r\nIn view of this state of affairs the Government is taking\r\nthe most vigorous steps to stamp out the rebellion and inflict\r\ncondign punishment on all rebels and traitors.  A proclamation\r\ndeclaring martial law throughout the Union will appear\r\nin a Gazette Extraordinary to-day.*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* \"U. G. No. 10-'15\", pp. 22-24.\r\n--\r\n==\r\n\r\nThis treachery was more fully described by a Cape Attorney\r\n-- a subaltern in the Citizen Force under Maritz -- in the following letter\r\nto the `Transvaal Leader':\r\n\r\n==\r\n\"We arrived at Kakamas,\" he writes, \"after a long and wearisome trek\r\nthrough Bushmanland, a company of about eighty, consisting mostly\r\nof raw farmer youths.\r\n\r\n\"We remained in camp for about six weeks, and, in the first week of October,\r\norders came from Maritz for 200 troops, comprising the Calvinia, Clanwilliam,\r\nand Kenhardt men, to strike camp and trek toward the German border.\r\n\r\n\"Two days later the remaining men in camp, consisting of\r\nthe Kakamas members of the Defence Force, some Kakamas Volunteers,\r\nand our own troop, altogether about 300 men, likewise trekked\r\nin that direction.  After two days' riding, we came to a farm\r\ncalled Blokzijnputs, where we met the first 200 men.\r\n\r\n\"The village of Keimoes was crowded with German troops; our men and officers\r\nwere walking and talking among them on the friendliest possible terms,\r\nand the German and the old Transvaal Republican flags were flying\r\nside by side.\r\n\r\n\"In a very short time we were made fully aware of the position.\r\nThe act of treachery which led up to it was being freely discussed\r\nby everybody, and then I realized that `we' -- I say `we',\r\nfor I never for one second doubted that most of our men would refuse\r\nto turn rebels -- had been caught like rats in a trap.\r\n\r\n\"But a further shock awaited me.  About half an hour after our arrival\r\nwe were summoned to fall in before Maritz, who then addressed the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"He first spoke about the Government wishing to force him over the border\r\nwith a lot of untrained and unarmed youngsters, and went on to say\r\nthat he refused to sacrifice their lives.\r\n\r\n\"After a bitter attack on the characters of Generals Smuts and Botha,\r\nhe denounced the British Empire as a whole, and wound up by declaring himself\r\nan out and out rebel.\r\n\r\n\"He stated that he was going to fight against the Union\r\nand Imperial Governments for the independence of South Africa,\r\nand called upon all who were unwilling to follow him,\r\nor `had the English feeling in them', to stand on one side.\r\n\r\n                        \"Ten Loyal out of Six Hundred\"\r\n\r\n\"This speech was followed by a short speech in German\r\nby the representative of the Governor-General of German South-West Africa.\r\n\r\n\"Then followed a scene which can never be forgotten by those who witnessed it.\r\nAll our men started to shout, cheer, and throw up their hats -- all except\r\nten of us, who stood there looking, I suppose, more dead than alive.\r\nJust imagine, out of 600 men actually trekking towards the border\r\nto invade German territory only ten refused to turn rebels.\r\n\r\n\"However, after recovering somewhat, we approached our captain (Beukes)\r\nand told him we were not going to join Maritz, and asked him to see\r\nthat we were not sent to Windhuk.  This Maritz had given us to understand\r\nwas the only alternative to joining him.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer proceeds to state that after being kept prisoners for some time\r\nthey were set free forty miles from a Union troop frontier post.\r\n-- `Central News'.*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* See also Appendix to the \"Report of the Select Committee on Rebellion\",\r\n  S.C. 1-'15.\r\n--\r\n==\r\n\r\n                              In the \"Free\" State\r\n\r\nGeneral De Wet organized large commandos and took possession\r\nof the town of Heilbron, held up a train and captured\r\nGovernment stores and ammunition, some prominent Burghers\r\nbeing among his active supporters; so much so that, a week later,\r\nwhen President Steyn was endeavouring to get him to Bloemfontein,\r\nin order to persuade him to discuss terms of peace with General Botha,\r\nhe had no fewer than 3,000 men under him.\r\n\r\nGeneral De Wet publicly unfurled the rebel banner in October,\r\nwhen he entered the town of Reitz at the head of an armed commando.\r\nSome of his men assaulted the postmaster, who was in the act\r\nof telegraphing the news to the capital, and destroyed his instruments.\r\nThe guerrilla General addressed an open-air meeting, which he ordered\r\nthe Magistrate to attend.  When that official \"refused to attend\r\na rebel meeting\" General De Wet sent six men to compel him,\r\nand to use violence if necessary.\r\n\r\nHaving thus forcibly secured the attendance of the Magistrate,\r\nhe proceeded to unbosom himself as follows:  \"Ladies, gentlemen, and burghers,\r\nI have asked you to come together here to explain to you my position.\"\r\n\r\nThen turning to the Magistrate, he said:  \"Magistrate, I want you to get\r\na shorthand writer to take down every word that I am going to say,\r\nbecause whatever I may do in future I can never commit\r\na greater act of rebellion than I have already committed.\r\nI am going through to Maritz, where we will receive arms and ammunition,\r\nand from there we are going to Pretoria to pull down the British flag\r\nand proclaim a free South African republic.  All those who side with me\r\nmust follow me, and those who side with the Government must go to it.\r\nI signed the Vereeniging Treaty and swore to be faithful to the British flag,\r\nbut we have been so downtrodden by the miserable and pestilential English\r\nthat we can endure it no longer.  His Majesty King Edward VII\r\npromised to protect us, but he has failed to do so, and allowed a Magistrate\r\nto be placed over us who is an absolute tyrant, and has made it impossible\r\nfor us to tolerate it any longer.  I was charged before him for beating\r\na native boy.  I only did it with a small shepherd's whip, and for that\r\nI was fined 5s.*  (Here the Magistrate interrupted him and asked him\r\nwhether he did not plead guilty.  He admitted that he had pleaded guilty,\r\nand ordered the Magistrate to keep quiet, and he would allow him\r\nto say as much as he liked when he had finished speaking,\r\nand if he would not hold his tongue he would make him hold it.)\r\n\r\n--\r\n* General Smuts, after this, christened the rising as\r\n  \"the Five Shilling Rebellion\".\r\n--\r\n\r\n\"But,\" continued General De Wet, \"after the Magistrate had delivered judgment,\r\ninstead of reprimanding the boy and ordering him in future\r\nto be obedient and do his duty, he looked at the Native as if he would like\r\nto give him a kiss.  The Magistrate is a brother-in-law of a man\r\nfor whom I have the greatest respect and who is very dear to me\r\n(President Steyn), and for that reason I will give him another chance,\r\notherwise I would have taken him prisoner and handed him over to the Germans.\r\nThe Magistrate's father was one of the staunchest pillars of the church,\r\nand if he were alive to-day he would be heart and soul with me\r\nin this movement, and condemn the dastardly act of robbery\r\nwhich the Government are going to commit.\r\n\r\n\"The ungodly policy of Botha has gone on long enough; the South African Dutch\r\nare going to stand as one man to crush this unholy scandal.\r\nSome of my friends have advised me to wait a little longer\r\nuntil England has received a bigger knock, but it is beneath me and my people\r\nto kick a dead dog.  England has got her hands full enough.\r\nI hate the lies which are continually being spread to the effect\r\nthat thousands of Australians, Canadians and Indians can be sent to fight us.\r\nWhere will England get them from?  She has enough to fight her own battles.\r\n\r\n\"I am going through the town to take the following six articles,\r\nviz., horses, saddles, bridles, halters, arms and ammunition,\r\nand if anybody should refuse to hand to my men these articles,\r\nif they should be found in their possession, I will give him a thrashing\r\nwith a sjambok.  I now order the storekeepers to go and open their shops\r\nand I will select men to go round and take whatever I require\r\napart from the above articles, and they will give receipts for what they take;\r\nand if they do not open their shops willingly I will open them in another way.\r\nMy advice to you English is to remain quiet in your houses and not interfere\r\nwith my men, and if you don't, beware when I come back!\r\nI have got my eight sons and sons-in-law here with me,\r\nand the only people left on my farm are my wife and daughter.\r\nAnybody can go and see if they like, and I request the Magistrate\r\nto give them any help they may require, if he will do so.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wessel Wessels, a famous \"Free\" State politician,\r\nhaving taken possession of Harrismith in the name of General De Wet,\r\nwas alleged to have had the audacity to send letters to Chief Ntsane Mopedi,\r\nof the Harrismith district, and to the Paramount Chief of Basutoland,\r\ninforming them that, with the assistance of the Germans, the Boers were going\r\nto drive away the English and re-proclaim a Dutch Republic\r\nin South Africa; and requesting those chiefs to remain neutral\r\nwhile the annihilation of the English was in progress.\r\nOnly in case the English should arm the Indians, were they to mobilize\r\ntheir warriors (the Basutos) on the side of the Boer-German combination.\r\n\r\n    Dit is ver weg na Tippererie,\r\n     Dit is ver om te gaan;\r\n    Dit is ver weg na Tippererie,\r\n     Om my hart se punt te zien.\r\n        Goen dag, Pikadillie\r\n        Vaarwel, Lester-squeer;\r\n    Dit is ver, ver weg na Tippererie\r\n     Maar my hart le net daar.\r\n                             \"Tipperary\" in Cape Dutch.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch, like other people, also had a prophet.  Many stories\r\nwere told since the outbreak of the war by the seer, Van Rensburg,\r\nand among other visions credited to him he was said to\r\nhave dreamt of the impending \"removal of the British yoke\r\nfrom the necks of Afrikanders\", and the forthcoming expulsion\r\nfrom South Africa of the English people and their flag,\r\nwith the aid of Germany.\r\n\r\nWhatever might be said about what the prophet Van Rensburg\r\nhad foretold in other respects, the prophecies attributed to him\r\nin regard to the European War resemble other war prophecies\r\n(credited to French, Russian, and German women), in that the wish, it seems,\r\nis often father to the thought.\r\n\r\nThe lower middle-class Boers attach great weight to the guesses\r\nof native bonethrowers.  It is strange sometimes when a Malay charmer\r\nis prosecuted for imposing on the public to find Dutch witnesses\r\ngiving evidence of the healing powers possessed by the accused and emphasizing\r\nthe absurdity of prosecuting a man who benefited them and their relatives\r\nmore than many a certificated medical man.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the forecasts credited to Van Rensburg seemed to have found\r\nample corroboration in the cabled newspaper accounts of the rapid advance\r\nof the armies of General Von Kluck through Belgium towards Paris,\r\nand in the minds of such gullible patriots as the South African Boers\r\nthis telegraphic war news acted like manure on a fertile field.\r\n\r\n==\r\n                            The Seer Van Rensburg*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* \"U.G. No. 10-'15\".\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe seer was Nicolas van Rensburg, of Lichtenburg, a simple\r\nand illiterate farmer.  He was a prophet not without honour\r\nin his own country.  On many occasions he had given proof positive\r\nof the possession of extraordinary powers of prevision,\r\nso men said and believed.  It would be out of place here\r\nto give examples of the many telepathic forecasts (or happy guesses)\r\nwith which he was credited.  It is certain that he had a great hold\r\non the imagination of thousands of his people.  During the Anglo-Boer War\r\nsome commandos, when Van Rensburg was in their lager,\r\nneglected all precautions.  If \"Oom Niklaas\" declared that the English\r\nwere not in the neighbourhood, it was a waste of energy\r\nto post sentries and keep a look out.\r\n\r\nHis reputation had, strangely enough, not diminished since the war.\r\nThis was perhaps due to several causes.  He had never attempted\r\nto exploit his \"gift\" and impressed most of those who came\r\nin contact with him with his apparent sincerity.  If he duped others,\r\nit seemed he also duped himself.  Moreover, and this was perhaps\r\nthe secret of his continued success, his \"visions\" were invariably\r\nsymbolic and mysterious; they possessed an adaptability of character\r\nthat was truly Delphic.  Indeed, his hearers were compelled\r\nto put their own interpretation upon his visions.  The seer seldom pretended\r\nto understand or explain them himself.\r\n\r\nGeneral De la Rey took a great interest in the seer, who had belonged\r\nto his commandos during the Anglo-Boer War.  Van Rensburg again\r\nhad the greatest admiration for General De la Rey, and had frequently\r\nhinted to his circle that great things were in store for the General.\r\nOne of his visions had been well known to General De la Rey and his friends\r\nfor some years.  The seer had beheld the number 15 on a dark cloud,\r\nfrom which blood issued, and then General De la Rey returning home\r\nwithout his hat.  Immediately afterwards came a carriage covered\r\nwith flowers.*  What these things portended, Van Rensburg could not say.\r\nHe believed that they signified some high honour for the General. . . .\r\n\r\n--\r\n* General De la Rey was accidentally shot on the night of September 15.\r\n  The last house he stayed in was No. 15, and the funeral train\r\n  that brought his body to Lichtenburg had a carriage full of floral tributes.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen the war at last broke out, the effect in Lichtenburg was instantaneous.\r\nThe prophecies of Van Rensburg were eagerly recalled, and it was remembered\r\nthat he had foretold a day on which the independence of the Transvaal\r\nwould be restored.  One officer actually called up his men\r\nto be in readiness on Sunday, August 9, as that would be the day on which\r\nthe prophecy would be fulfilled.  After this, too, certain individuals\r\ncould be seen daily cleaning their rifles and cartridges in order to be ready\r\nfor THE DAY.  Several men in this district claimed to be\r\nin regular communication with German South-West Africa before August, 1914.\r\nWithin a week of the declaration of war between England and Germany\r\nthe district was further profoundly stirred by the news\r\n(now become generally known) that a great meeting of local burghers\r\nwas to be held at Treurfontein on August 15, and that certain local officers\r\nwere commandeering their burghers to come to this meeting\r\narmed and fully equipped for active service. . . .\r\n\r\nThe meeting was to be addressed by General De la Rey,\r\nand it was generally believed that the assembled burghers\r\nwould march on Potchefstroom immediately after the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe prophecies of Van Rensburg had a great deal to do with the excitement\r\nwhich had been produced locally.  The strange vision of the number 15,\r\nwhich had long been common knowledge, was now discussed with intense interest.\r\nThe 15, it was said, signified August 15, the day of the meeting.\r\nThat would be THE DAY, which had been so long expected --\r\nthe day of liberation.  Van Rensburg was now the oracle.\r\nHis prophecies with regard to the great war had been signally fulfilled.\r\nGermany was at grips with England, and her triumph was looked upon\r\nas inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe day had arrived to strike a blow for their lost independence.\r\nVan Rensburg assured his following that the Union Government was \"finished\".\r\nNot a shot would be fired.  The revolution would be complete and bloodless.\r\n\r\nBetween the 10th and the 15th the plotters in Lichtenburg\r\nwere actively preparing for the day.  There is evidence\r\nthat German secret agents were working in concert with them.\r\nThe 15th would mark the beginning of a new era.  When doubters asked\r\nhow they could be so certain that the 15 signified a day of the month\r\n-- and of the month of August in particular -- they were scornfully\r\nif illogically told that \"in God's time a month sooner or later\r\nmade no difference.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government had been informed by its local supporters\r\nof these alarming preparations.  It was quite clear that an attempt\r\nwas to be made on the 15th to start a rebellion.  Everything would depend\r\non the meeting which was to be addressed by General De la Rey.\r\nGeneral De la Rey's position in the Western Transvaal was unique.\r\nHe possessed an unrivalled influence and was looked up to\r\nas the uncrowned King of the West.  His attitude at the meeting\r\nwould sway the mass of his adherents and decide the question of peace or war.\r\n\r\nGeneral Botha summoned General De la Rey to Pretoria some days\r\nbefore the meeting, and was able to persuade him to use his best endeavours\r\nto calm the excited feelings which had been aroused and to use his influence\r\nto see that no untoward incidents should occur.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 15th, the great meeting was held.  About 800 burghers\r\nwere present.  General De la Rey addressed them and explained\r\nthe situation in Europe.  He exhorted his audience to remain cool and calm\r\nand to await events.  After the address \"a strange and unusual silence\"\r\nwas observed.  A resolution was passed unanimously expressing complete\r\nconfidence in the Government to act in the best interests of South Africa\r\nin the present world-crisis.  The address seemed to have had\r\na very good effect.  The burghers appeared to have taken their leader's advice\r\nto heart, as they dispersed quietly to their homes.\r\n==\r\n\r\nAll danger of a rebellious movement had apparently been averted,\r\nbut only for a time.\r\n\r\nThe Potchefstroom `Herald' tells a story of what it describes\r\nas \"the inner history of a damnable plot\", and of how near\r\nPotchefstroom* was to falling into the hands of the rebels through\r\nthe treachery of Beyers and his accomplices on the night of September 15,\r\nwhich was the date on which the late General De la Rey was killed.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* The old capital of Transvaal where General De Wet and General Kemp\r\n  held the dramatic meeting on October 2, 1914.\r\n--\r\n\r\n==\r\nIt is unquestionable (says the `Herald') that Beyers, who was forced to admit\r\nthat he was on his way to Potchefstroom when the accident happened,\r\nwas to have started an attempt to overthrow the Government\r\nwith the aid of the men, over 2,000 in number, who had just finished\r\ntheir period of three weeks' training in the Active Citizen Camp\r\nat Potchefstroom.  Both he and Kemp had resigned their positions,\r\nand, knowing the treacherous mission upon which he was setting out that night\r\nas the emissary of the German enemy, little wonder was it that at Langlaagte\r\nBeyers cowered with fear, and lost his nerve entirely, because he thought\r\nhis own arrest was at hand.\r\n\r\nContinuing the account, the paper says:  On the morning parade\r\non Tuesday morning the rebel Colonels Bezuidenhout and Kock\r\nhad each addressed their men in an attempt to imbue them\r\nwith a spirit of revolt against their own Government.\r\nAll the Dutch-speaking Afrikanders were advised not to volunteer\r\nfor German South-West; that was the job of the Englishman.\r\nThe officers plainly said that they had no intention of doing their duty:\r\nthey had other fish to fry.  And they permitted the few volunteers\r\nwho stood out in spite of them to be jeered at by the \"neutrals\".\r\nThe disgrace of that early morning parade scene must for ever be upon\r\nthe traitors concerned.  It was certain that dastardly influences\r\nwere at work, but thanks to the sterling loyalty of certain men\r\nfrom among the Dutch population, the plans of the conspirators\r\nwere more or less known, and arrangements were made to checkmate them.\r\nAll honour to these true patriots who took a big risk\r\nfor the safety of the country.\r\n\r\nThat evening a meeting of Britishers took place in Potchefstroom\r\nto discuss the situation (says the `Herald'), and it was agreed\r\nthat its seriousness was such as to necessitate direct communication\r\nwith General Smuts, which was duly carried out.  For one thing,\r\npractically all Britishers were unarmed.  How critical was the position,\r\nor how near Potchefstroom was to complete disaster, was not then\r\nfully realized.  On that night, too, there was another and more sinister\r\nmeeting in the town.  It was at a certain house in Berg Street,\r\nwhere a number of residents, male and female, who can be named,\r\nexpected the arrival of the chief conspirator.  Then, too,\r\nat the Defence Force headquarters Kemp had stored a quantity of ammunition\r\nthat was altogether out of proportion to the requirements of his district,\r\nand during the week there had been frequent communications with\r\nthe Lichtenburg \"prophet\".  Beyers had arranged to reach the Defence Force\r\nat 3 a.m., where motor-cars waited.\r\n\r\nLater he was to have marched upon the town with all the armed men\r\nhe could bring under his influence, knowing full well,\r\nby previous arrangement, that he could rely on the aid of rebels\r\nwithin Potchefstroom itself.  So intense was the feeling of danger\r\nin camp that night that loyal officers slept with loaded revolvers at hand\r\nand all the spare ammunition under the beds.  The Union Jack\r\nwas to be supplanted and the new Republic was to be declared\r\nwith the Vierkleur flying -- or would it have been the German flag?\r\nThat was the morning of September 16, and as showing\r\nthe concerted character of the traitorous plans, it should be noted that\r\nthe proclamation signed by the Governor-General of German South-West Africa,\r\nthe \"scrap of paper\" used as a sop for the Boers, was dated for\r\nthe self-same day.\r\n\r\n                         Plot Providentially Thwarted\r\n\r\nBut the motor-car tragedy in the dark at Langlaagte was the second blow\r\nto this criminal plot (continues the paper), and when Beyers,\r\ntrembling and unnerved, spoke through the telephone at midnight\r\non September 15, telling of the fatal shot, and that his journey\r\nhad been cut short, those who had waited in the camp and in the town\r\nknew that, for the time being at any rate, the little game was up.\r\nKemp, of course, at once tried to withdraw his resignation, but luckily\r\nGeneral Smuts gave the snub direct.  Already the names of local men\r\nto be terrorized, and even shot, were in the mouths of the irreconcilables\r\n-- skulking cowards for the most part -- of whom more must yet be written\r\nin the interests of public morality.\r\n\r\nThat night Potchefstroom might easily have fallen into the hands\r\nof the rebel crew, sharing the fate of the Free State towns or worse,\r\nand loyalists, both English and Dutch, must thank an ever-watchful Providence\r\nfor being saved from a position of ignominy and humiliation.\r\n==\r\n\r\nIf all this be true,* and the Government had been informed of it,\r\none cannot understand why General Beyers, with his fingers steeped in treason,\r\nwas let loose upon the community to poison the loyalty of the Dutch\r\nalong the country-side and to complicate the task of the Government.\r\nIt seems that he should have been detained that evening,\r\nand thereby, having been turned from the path of suicide, other lives\r\nwould also have been saved.  When one considers the amount of harm\r\nthat he was able to do subsequently, it is staggering to think\r\nwhat the task of the loyalists would have been had his plans been reinforced\r\nby the success of this night plot.  It would have given\r\na link of tremendous power to the rebel movement throughout the country\r\nif they had captured the stores, munitions, and a ready army that awaited\r\nGeneral Beyers's arrival at Potchefstroom.  The fact that some Burghers\r\nwere found organizing rebel commandos in the \"Free\" State and Transvaal\r\neven after the capture of General De Wet and the drowning of General Beyers\r\nought to show the prevailing Backveld spirit up to the early months of 1915.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* The `Herald's' story has since been confirmed by the Government Blue Book\r\n  on the Rebellion.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen the rebels were tried in Pretoria and elsewhere in January and February,\r\nBurghers crowded the law courts and rose to their feet,\r\nas if in token of their fellow-feeling with the prisoners,\r\neach time a rebel was placed in the dock.  At Pretoria,\r\nthis vaunting demonstration seems only to have been ended\r\nby the announcement of the Magistrate that if they did it again\r\nhe would have to clear the court.  It is not stated, however,\r\nwhether the prisoners duly acknowledged the sympathy thus shown\r\nwith a bow from the dock.  One member of Parliament (not a rebel)\r\nis said to have swaggered into the Bloemfontein court and, after shaking hands\r\nwith the prisoners, conversed with them in an audible tone.\r\n\r\nNothing better illustrates the unsatisfactory nature of the South African\r\nmilitary appointments than the Press report that the English artillerymen\r\nwho served under Maritz were in constant danger of their lives, and that,\r\nrealizing this fact, they were compelled sometimes to keep their machine guns\r\ntrained on their comrades.  The poor men must have had an awful time,\r\nliterally \"sleeping with one eye wide open\".\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Maritz at length threw off the mask and openly proclaimed\r\nhis treachery, he put these artillerymen under arrest and handed them over\r\nto the Germans as prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nOf course, if the Government of the Union was as well administered\r\nas was the Cape Government before it, such things would have been impossible,\r\nbecause only tried men with military experience would have been appointed\r\nto the command of the Union Forces -- men whose loyalty was beyond reproach --\r\nthat is to say, if high official appointments went by merit and not by favour.\r\nA professional lawyer like General Beyers would have been the last person\r\nto get a position which should have been given to a trained soldier,\r\nof whom there are many in the country.  But as his appointment took place\r\nat a time when some English officials were politely removed\r\nfrom high positions to make room for influential Dutchmen,\r\nand in certain cases useless posts, such as \"Inspector of white labour\",\r\nand inspector of goodness-knows-what (all of them carrying high emoluments),\r\nwere created for political favourites, General Beyers's appointment\r\ncaused no surprise, as the \"pitchfork\" had already become\r\npart of our Government machinery.  But how such a man as Manie Maritz\r\nbecame a Colonel in the Colonial Defence Force is one of those things which,\r\nas Lord Dundreary would say, \"no fellah can understand\".\r\n\r\nThe man is not only said to have rebelled during the South African war,\r\nbut he is also said to have escaped to German South Africa\r\nto evade the consequence, and that he only returned to British South Africa\r\nwhen the Boers got their constitution.  And when British officers\r\nlike Colonel Mackenzie and Colonel Lukin apparently acquiesce\r\nin an appointment that places them on a level with a man like that,\r\nthe voteless black taxpayer who has no control over these appointments\r\ncannot be blamed for feeling perplexed at the turn events are taking.\r\n\r\nHere is an expression of this perplexity:  The old chief Tshabadira\r\nasked the Government Secretary in 1913, at Thaba Nchu,\r\n\"How many kings have we?  Is there an English King and a Dutch King,\r\neach trying to rule in his own way?  And since we cannot very well\r\nfollow both, which one are we to obey?\"  Dutch and English colonists\r\nhave ruled the Cape for forty years and no such questions were ever asked.\r\n\r\nIf General De Wet were to be tried by a court of native chiefs,\r\nwho followed \"the wheels of administration\" during the past five years,\r\nthey would in all probability decide that the British Government,\r\nto which he pledged his allegiance, and the semi-Republican Government\r\nagainst which he rebelled are two entirely different bodies.\r\nThey would possibly reason that he pledged his allegiance\r\nto a Greater Britain -- or to localize it, to a Greater Cape Colony,\r\nnot to a Greater Transvaal.\r\n\r\nThe Cape Colony is often reproached because native taxpayers\r\nwithin its boundaries have votes and help their white neighbours\r\nto elect members of Parliament.  But strange to say,\r\nwhen a revolutionary mob seized the South African railways in 1914, it was\r\nthe railway men of the much-abused Cape who, in spite of the native vote,\r\ndragged the Government out of a serious situation.  Similarly when\r\nthese high officers of the Defence Force in Transvaal and Orange \"Free\" State\r\nrebelled and joined the Germans with their commandos, the Dutchmen of the Cape\r\n(presumably because \"they vote side by side with the Kafirs\")\r\ndenounced the treachery in unmistakable terms.  The South African party\r\nat the Cape beat up its followers to the support of the Government,\r\nand the voice of the Cape section of the Dutch Reformed Church\r\nrang from pulpit and platform in denunciation of disloyalty and treason.\r\nBut in the Northern Provinces, where white men are pampered and guarded\r\nby the Government against the so-called humiliation of allowing\r\nnative taxpayers to vote, there the rebellion, having been regarded\r\nwith seeming approval, gained a marvellous impetus.\r\n\r\nAnd the strangest of all these things is how men with bank balances\r\nlike the Dutchmen of Transvaal and the Orange \"Free\" State\r\ncould fail to appreciate the debt they owe to the British Navy,\r\nby which the commercial routes from South Africa to the outer world\r\nare kept open to them, when practically the whole world is ablaze.\r\n\r\nThe banner of revolt having been unfurled, the \"Free\" State towns of Reitz,\r\nHeilbron, and Harrismith being in the hands of \"Free\" State rebels,\r\nmartial law was proclaimed, and General Botha, as forecasted\r\nin the native letter quoted in a previous chapter, assumed command\r\nof the Union Forces and squelched the upheaval.  Altogether the rebellion\r\ncost South Africa some of the finest of its young men.\r\nDutch, English, coloured and native families suffered the loss of their sons\r\nin the flower of their youth, including among many others,\r\nprominent South Africans, such as Mr. W. Pickering, the general secretary\r\nof the Kimberley mines, and Mr. Justice Hopley of Rhodesia,\r\nwho each lost a son.\r\n\r\nOne loss which the Natives, judging by articles in their newspapers,\r\nwill not easily forget is that of Captain William Allan King,\r\nthe late Sub-Commissioner of Pretoria.  He was shot by a rebel,\r\non November 23, near Hamaanskraal, whilst helping a wounded trooper.\r\nIn his lifetime his duties brought him in touch with employers of labour\r\nin the Pretoria Labour District and with Natives from all over South Africa.\r\nA non-believer in the South African policy of least resistance, he was\r\nwithout doubt the ablest native administrator in the Transvaal Civil Service,\r\nand as such the vacancy caused by his death will be very hard to fill.\r\nHe was an expert on Native matters, and no commission ever sat\r\nwithout his being summoned to give evidence before it.\r\n\r\nThe Natives called him \"Khoshi-ke-Nna\", which means \"I am the Chief\".\r\nA firm but just Englishman, with a striking military gait,\r\nhe would have been an ideal leader of the native contingents\r\nhad the offer of native help been accepted by the Union Government.\r\n\r\nThe casualty list on both sides exceeded one thousand.\r\nOver ten thousand rebels were imprisoned, of whom 293 leaders will be tried,\r\nthe rest being detained up till the end of the trouble.\r\n\r\nAfter various encounters with the Union forces under General Botha,\r\nGeneral De Wet suffered a series of heavy defeats.  Many of\r\nhis followers surrendered, and his son was killed on the battlefield.\r\nHe tried to escape to German South West Africa, but was overtaken and captured\r\nin Bechuanaland, with fifty followers, including his secretary, Mr. Oost,\r\nformerly editor of a Pretoria weekly paper.\r\n\r\nConsidering his initial bounce and bluster, General De Wet's surrender\r\nwas a particularly tame affair.  Said the captive to the captor:\r\n\"I seem to know you -- are you not Jordaan?\"  \"Yes, General,\"\r\nreplied the captor.  \"I saw you at Vereeniging where we made peace.\"\r\n\"Very well,\" rejoined the captive, \"I must congratulate you\r\non your achievement.  It was very smart.  Anyway, I am glad\r\nthat I am taken by you and not by an Englishman.\"*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* Gen. De Wet was tried and sentenced by the Special court\r\n  to six years' imprisonment and a fine of 2,000 Pounds.\r\n--\r\n\r\nGeneral Kemp succeeded in eluding his pursuers by means of forced marches\r\nacross the Kalahari desert, and effected a junction with Maritz\r\nin German South West Africa; but after only a few weeks' taste of German rule\r\nhe returned to the Union and surrendered with his commando and all arms,\r\nevidently satisfied with British rule.  Some of his men were wearing\r\nGerman uniforms.  The prophet Rensburg, carrying a big umbrella,\r\nalso surrendered with him.\r\n\r\nGeneral Beyers was the first to succumb.  Cornered by the loyal forces,\r\nhe was driven up against the Vaal River in flood.  With his pursuers\r\non the one side and the raging torrent on the other, he was drowned\r\nin an ill-starred attempt to escape across that treacherous river.\r\nParties were sent out to drag the river and search for the body,\r\nand a reward of 50 Pounds was offered to the finder.\r\nMrs. Beyers left Pretoria in a special train with a coffin on board,\r\nto join the search party.  She was accompanied by a few relatives and friends,\r\nincluding one doctor of medicine and one minister of religion.  They travelled\r\nalong the Johannesburg-Kimberley line as far as Maquasi, near the river,\r\nwhere they received tidings of the recovery of General Beyers's body.\r\nIt was found by a Dutch farmer, who promptly claimed the 50 Pound reward.\r\n\r\nA telegram to Pretoria brought back a reply from General Smuts\r\nstating that it was inadvisable to convey the body to the capital\r\nat the time, so he was buried by the parson on the veld\r\nto the accompaniment of lightning flashes which blind the eye,\r\nand salutes of loud peals of African thunder, which shake the earth\r\nin a manner that is known only to persons who have spent a summer\r\nin the interior of South Africa.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the late General insured his life so heavily before\r\nthe outbreak that representatives of the several insurance companies concerned\r\nhad to meet after his death and consider the matter of their liability.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the story of the \"Five Shilling Rebellion\" is soon told.\r\nAfter the proclamation of martial law the Premier assumed\r\nthe supreme command of the Union forces and called out all the citizens --\r\nthe whites to arms and the blacks as drivers and manual labourers\r\nat the front.  Some Boers who could not give a satisfactory excuse\r\ndisobeyed the call, and were sentenced to terms of imprisonment\r\nwith hard labour under the Defence Act.  Thus backed by the overwhelming\r\nsupport of the various peoples of the Union of all creeds and colours,\r\nthe Prime Minister made a clean sweep of the rising,\r\nand in less than two months the Rt. Hon. Louis Botha was once again\r\nmaster of the situation from the shores of the Indian Ocean in the east\r\nto the Atlantic coast in the west.  And when the rebel leaders\r\nwere cogitating over the situation in durance vile, the Prime Minister\r\nwas sending a message from German South West Africa, on February 26,\r\nasking Parliament to deal leniently with the rebels.\r\n\r\n    Keise qusa Tipereri,\r\n    Kgam'se gaqu ha;\r\n    Keise qusa Tipereri\r\n    Artie ti gxawo si mu.\r\n    Hamnci gqo Pikadili.\r\n    Hamnci Gqo Lester Skuer\r\n    Keise qusa, qusa Tipereri\r\n    Mar, ti xawo nxeba ha.\r\n                             \"Tipperary\" in Qoranna.*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* This language is also spoken by the Namaquas and some of the tribes\r\n  in German South West Africa.\r\n--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV    Piet Grobler\r\n\r\n  Lecture delivered by Mr. Sol T. Plaatje before the \"Marsh Street Men's Own\"\r\n    Literary Society in the Lecture Room of their Institute,\r\n    Hoe Street, Walthamstow, on February 26, 1915.\r\n\r\n      Keep me in chains?

Bohanan.*\r\n\r\n  --\r\n  * In the Kalahari language, BOHANAN means:  `Be combined'.\r\n  --\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gentleman whose name forms the title of my lecture\r\nis a lawyer, a grand-nephew of the late President Kruger and,\r\ntill lately, a member of the Union Parliament.  He represented\r\nthe Dutch constituency of Rustenburg, a district whose Burghers\r\nwere responsible for a kind of administrative native land arrangement\r\nin the Transvaal Republic.  This arrangement, the result of a petition\r\nfrom Rustenburg, made it compulsory for native landowners in the Republic\r\nto register their farms in the names of white people.\r\nIn accordance with it, Natives who bought land had to register it\r\nin the name of the Minister of Native Affairs.  But as such Ministers\r\ndid not always command the trust of the Natives they resorted to the expedient\r\nof registering their farms in the names of some European friends,\r\nmissionaries or otherwise.  Some European gentlemen thus became\r\nthe registered owners of land belonging to Natives, giving the Natives\r\nreceipts for the money and documents explaining the nature of the transaction.\r\nOther Europeans, including missionaries, were not so scrupulous.\r\nThey gave the Natives no receipt, so that after their death\r\nthe properties of these Natives passed into the estates of the deceased.\r\nThe following case is an example.\r\n\r\nThe native peasants on a Transvaal farm found themselves in such a dilemma\r\nafter the death of General Joubert, late Superintendent of Natives\r\nof the Transvaal Republic.  The black \"owners\" had no document showing\r\nthat they were the real owners of the farm and that General Joubert's name\r\nwas only registered to meet the requirements of the Volksraad.\r\nIn such circumstances they received notice from his executors\r\nto leave the General's farm.  They appealed to the law-courts and adduced\r\nverbal evidence in support of their purchase and ownership of the farm;\r\nthe sale had been a public one.  Besides, according to their ideas,\r\nit needed no documentary evidence, since they were legally in possession.\r\nThe Court, after listening to the evidence concerning the sums paid\r\nby individual Natives of the tribe, of the total sum paid for the farm,\r\nand of the legal reason why the title bore a white man's name,\r\nheld that however unfortunate was the position of those Natives if their story\r\nwas true, it could only give judgment in terms of the title deeds.\r\nThus Natives who were originally dispossessed of their land\r\nby conquest, and who swore to having purchased in hard cash\r\nland in their own country from the conquerors, were now for the second time,\r\nso they stated, dispossessed and turned off that land\r\nall owing to the complicated registration under this \"Besluit\"\r\nfrom Rustenburg.\r\n\r\nAfter the British occupation in 1900, the Courts held\r\nthat the \"Besluit\" and its practices did not have the force of law,\r\nand Natives took advantage of the ruling to transfer their properties\r\nto their own names; but in 1913, Mr. Piet Grobler, M.L.A.,\r\nmoved and succeeded in getting the Natives' Land Act carried\r\nin the Union Parliament, which has placed the Natives of the whole country\r\nin a more terrible plight than were the Natives of the Transvaal Republic\r\nbefore the war.\r\n\r\nSince he took his seat in the Union Parliament, Mr. Piet Grobler,\r\nlike Mr. Keyter of Ficksburg, has given the Natives no rest.  He first made\r\nhis power felt in 1911, when General Smuts introduced a Bill to consolidate\r\nthe marriage laws of the four Provinces.  Mr. Grobler then moved\r\na fatal colour clause which had the effect of killing the Bill,\r\nfor the Ministry, on finding that the Bill could only be carried\r\nwith the assistance of the Unionists, preferred to drop it\r\nrather than divide the Boer majority; and hence, thanks to Mr. Grobler,\r\nthe chaotic confusion still obtains in the South African marriage laws.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman, in 1913, led the attack in Parliament on Sir Richard Solomon,\r\nthe Union's representative in London, for not keeping his mouth shut\r\nwhen he is among British foreigners, and for daring to suggest\r\nBritish emigration to South Africa.  As stated above, Mr. Grobler demanded,\r\namong other things, that the Government should introduce\r\n\"during this session\" (1913) a law to stop the purchase and lease of land\r\nby Natives, and the Natives' Land Act of 1913 was the result of the demand --\r\na measure whose destructive severity forced the Natives\r\nto sue for Imperial protection against the South African Parliament.\r\n\r\nWhen the present European War broke out, Mr. Grobler was among\r\nthe Parliamentary clique of representatives whose Christian principles\r\nforbade them to vote for an armed expedition against\r\ntheir friendly neighbours, the Germans.  They said that,\r\nin Deuteronomy 19:14, God specifically warned the Boers\r\nagainst moving the landmarks of their neighbours.  But strange to say,\r\nthe religious scruples of these pious objectors never revolted against\r\nremoving the landmarks of their native neighbours and of appropriating,\r\nnot only their land and their labour, but even the persons\r\nof these neighbours.  The Natives, according to Mr. Luedorf,\r\na German evangelist among the Bechuana, witnessed the Boer trekkers\r\nmaltreating conquered Natives and taking their children as slaves.\r\nChildren who were unable to walk to their serfdom being\r\ngathered in a heap and burnt alive.  This, says Mr. Luedorf,\r\ncaused the Natives to exclaim:  \"Mzilikasi, the Matabele King,\r\nwas cruel to his enemies, but kind to those he conquered; whilst the Boers\r\nare cruel to their enemies and ill-treat and enslave their friends.\"*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* \"The Boer States\" (Keane), pp. 137-138.\r\n--\r\n\r\nNow, Mzilikasi had no Bible, but the Boer has the Bible and professes\r\nto honour it.  But his Bible, being of a flexible sort,\r\nit did not prevent a certain clique of Boers from taking up arms\r\nagainst the Government of which Mr. Lloyd George (a gentleman\r\nwho staked his reputation and risked his life in his fearless protests\r\nagainst the annexation of the Boer Republics) was a prominent member;\r\nand against the Liberal Government, which, as compensation\r\nfor the mere change of flags, made them a nice little present\r\nin the shape of the two old English Colonies of South Africa\r\nand the undisturbed permission to rule all that is therein.  Mr. Piet Grobler,\r\nthe author of most of our miseries, reached the climax of his career when,\r\nafter voting against the Union expedition to German South West Africa,\r\nhe not only persuaded British subjects not to volunteer for service\r\nin the expedition, but himself joined a force, as alleged\r\nby the South African papers to hand by the latest mail, to shoot down\r\nthe King's loyal subjects.  He was taken prisoner by General Botha's forces\r\nat the head of a rebel commando, presumably whilst on the way\r\nto join the Kaiser's forces in the German Colony.  He is thus\r\none of the members of the Union Parliament who forfeited their seats\r\nby breaking the Parliamentary oath and participating in the recent rebellion.\r\n\r\nMr. Solicitor Grobler's ideas about the sacredness of an oath\r\nare curious and original.  Every member of the Union Parliament,\r\nbefore taking his seat, has to subscribe to the following oath of allegiance\r\n\"before the Governor-General, or some person authorized by him\",\r\nusually a Judge of the Supreme Court:\r\n\r\n==\r\nI, M. . . . M. . . . do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance\r\nto His Majesty King George V, his heirs and successors according to law.\r\nSo help me God.\r\n==\r\n\r\nMr. Grobler, it is said, was caught red-handed in the treasonable act\r\nof leading a force of fifty armed rebels against the Government,\r\nand for his breach of the oath he was taken prisoner.  Last week,\r\nwhilst his trial was still pending, he applied for bail,\r\nand in support of his application, he pleaded that he was anxious\r\nTO ATTEND TO HIS PARLIAMENTARY DUTIES.  Here is a bit of Boer candour\r\nfor you!\r\n\r\nThe honourable and learned member is further stated to have pleaded\r\nthat his district provided the largest proportion of rebels and he was anxious\r\nto be in Capetown when Parliament opens this afternoon,* in order to be able\r\nto represent their case when the Legislature discusses the rebellion.\r\nThat is South African logic in a nutshell.  The Judge, however,\r\ntook a rational view of things and dismissed the application.\r\n\r\n--\r\n* The S. A. Parliament opened on the afternoon of the same day as the Lecture.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThere may be motives other than those stated by the incarcerated\r\nmember of Parliament actuating his desire to get to Capetown.\r\n\r\nEvery member of Parliament who absents himself without leave\r\nforfeits 2 Pounds a day out of his Parliamentary emoluments,\r\nso that Mr. Grobler's continued confinement in prison would entail\r\na serious financial deficit.  This was not the only instance in which\r\nanxiety of this kind was betrayed by recipients of Government bounties\r\nin South Africa.  There are a large number of well-to-do Boers\r\nwho draw annually hundreds of pounds from the Union Treasury, salaries which\r\na paternal Government taxes the poorly paid labourers of South Africa\r\nto provide.  This is particularly the case in the Transvaal.\r\nThere, princely salaries are paid for filling such superfluous posts\r\nas that of \"Inspector of White Labour\", \"Field Cornet\", and kindred offices.\r\nThe Field Cornet of each sub-district of the Transvaal\r\nis a very important gentleman, as is evinced by the intense labour\r\nattached to his office.  The duties of this \"hard-worked\" functionary\r\nconsist of the checking of the Parliamentary voters list of his ward,\r\nonce every two years, and of acting as chief canvasser and election agent\r\nfor the Ministerial candidate, who, however, is usually returned unopposed;\r\nand for these onerous duties he is rewarded by an ungrateful Government\r\nwith the \"beggarly\" salary of 260 Pounds a year.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are sundry little sinecures, equally remunerative,\r\nto which well-to-do Dutch farmers, who are the more\r\ngenerally preferred, aspire; and each fills his role\r\nwith acceptable dignity and a serious sense of responsibility.\r\nConsequently, there is more gnashing of teeth on the farm\r\nover the loss of one of these appointments than over\r\nthe failure of a whole year's crop.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these nominal \"members\" of the Union Civil Service\r\nwere said to have taken up arms and joined the rebellion.\r\nAccording to the South African papers, the wife of one of them\r\napplied to the defence office for the salary of her husband.\r\nWhen it was pointed out to her that her husband was at that time engaged\r\nin fighting against the forces of the Defence Department,\r\nshe coolly told the official that that had nothing to do\r\nwith his private affairs, i.e., the income from the Government.\r\nIn regard to the faithfulness of the class of officials just mentioned,\r\nI cannot refrain from drawing the attention of my audience\r\nto the fact that, as the electoral supporters of the Cabinet, they guided\r\nthe policy of the Union Government during the past five years, and they are\r\nthe type of legislators in whose tender care the Imperial Government\r\nwould fain entrust the liberties of the voteless Natives\r\nwithout even the safeguard of a right of appeal.\r\n\r\nPersonally I am not revengeful, and would wish Mr. Grobler every success\r\nin his defence; the Transvaal native taxpayer, on the other hand,\r\nearns an average wage of 20 Pounds per annum:  out of this he pays taxation\r\non the same scale as the white labourer who earns 25 Pounds a month;\r\nin addition, he pays a native tax of 3 Pounds 4s. per year, presumably as\r\na tax on the colour of his skin, for no white man pays that.  This extra tax,\r\napparently, is in order that Transvaal Field Cornets and members of Parliament\r\nshould more easily draw their pay.  In return for all these payments,\r\nand as a result of Mr. Grobler's legislative efforts,\r\nthe Transvaal native taxpayer got the Natives' Land Act of 1913;\r\nand I am afraid that HE will not be very sorry to know that some one else\r\nenjoys the 400 Pounds per annum hitherto received by Mr. Grobler,\r\ntogether with his free first-class travelling ticket\r\nover the South African railways.\r\n\r\nBritish pioneer officials, in Africa and elsewhere, have for generations\r\nbeen left in charge of mixed communities of white Colonials and black Natives\r\nand other immigrants.  In spite of occasional human lapses,\r\nthey have ruled these communities successfully throughout the past century,\r\nand maintained the high administrative reputation of the English\r\nin Africa, Asia and other parts of the globe.  The dominant race\r\nin South Africa, on the other hand, may be fit to govern themselves,\r\nbut their dealings with us show them to be wholly unfit to rule\r\nthe native races.  There is no more glaring illustration of this weakness\r\nthan the conduct of the rebel Boers and the loyal Boers\r\nduring the present war.  According to my latest information\r\nfrom different centres of South Africa, native peasants were horsewhipped\r\ninto the enemy's service as soon as the standard of rebellion was unfurled.\r\nThere can be no reason to doubt the veracity of my information\r\nwhen the Press reports have clearly shown that even a white skin\r\nhas ceased to be a protection against illtreatment.  At least\r\none loyal Magistrate and a postmaster were violently assaulted by\r\nGeneral De Wet's Burghers, so the official dispatches say.  Those shopkeepers\r\nwho hesitated to open their stores to the rebels were sjambokked\r\nas were the ordinary Natives, and the Mayor of a \"Free\" State town\r\nwas also flogged.\r\n\r\nAfter the proclamation of martial law General Botha marshalled\r\nthe loyal Boers throughout the country.  These loyal Burghers,\r\ntaking advantage of the presence of martial law, committed all kinds\r\nof excesses against loyal coloured civilians.  These atrocities\r\nnot only took place away in the Backveld, but sometimes\r\nin Capetown and Kimberley, the centres of African civilization;\r\nthere black men were frequently tied to the wagon-wheels and lashed\r\nby the loyal Boers, and some of these coloured victims, I am told,\r\nhave been cruelly done to death.\r\n\r\nOf course, if the particular Burgher who dealt the death-blow\r\ncan be identified he will be prosecuted, but that will not resuscitate\r\nthe victims.  It will only add misery to the innocent family of the offender.\r\nBut the fact remains that during the South African War,\r\nSouth Africa was a huge military camp, yet the unarmed Natives,\r\nmany of whom were then in the enemy's service, suffered nothing but kindness\r\nat the hands of Imperial troops, and there never was any conflict\r\nbetween the military and native civilians.  And it but reveals\r\nthe unfitness for self-government of the dominant race out there\r\nthat the Natives, who sympathize with the Government,\r\nshould be exposed to violence immediately the loyal Burghers are armed.\r\nThat is the condition of life under true South African ideals.\r\n\r\nHaving had the ear of the Union Government since the federation of the\r\nSouth African States, Mr. Piet Grobler and other men of his way of thinking\r\nhave been largely responsible for the repressive native laws\r\nthat have found their way into the statute book of the Union.\r\nIf the Natives of the other three Provinces had votes\r\nlike those of the Cape Province, they would help to return\r\nsober-minded members to Parliament who are not inimical to the public welfare,\r\ninstead of which they have been represented in the South African Parliament\r\nby budding subalterns of the German Army in South-West Africa.\r\nBut since the Imperial Government in its wisdom when granting\r\na Constitution to South Africa saw fit to withhold from the blacks\r\ntheir only weapon of protection against hostile legislation,\r\nviz., the power of the ballot, they surely, in common fairness\r\nto the Natives and from respect for their own honour,\r\ncannot reasonably stand aside as mere onlookers while\r\nself-condemned enemies of the Crown ram their violent laws\r\ndown the throats of the Natives.  The Imperial Government\r\nby the obligations of its overlordship and its plighted word\r\nto the Natives, at the time of the federation, is in duty bound\r\nto free the unrepresented Natives from the shackles of these laws,\r\nor otherwise, declare its guardianship of the interests of the Natives\r\nto have ceased, and counsel these weaker races to apply elsewhere for relief.\r\n\r\n     *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Epilogue\r\n\r\n  Oh, hear us for our native land,\r\n  The land we love the most:\r\n  Our fathers' sepulchres are here,\r\n  And here our kindred dwell;\r\n  Our children, too; how should we love\r\n     Another land so well?\r\n                                       Wreford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter partaking of hot cross buns at the family table\r\nof a dear old English family the day before yesterday (Good Friday),\r\nI went to Walthamstow, and there heard a moving discourse\r\ndelivered by the Rev. James Ellis on the sufferings and death of Christ\r\nfor the redemption of mankind.\r\n\r\nAt my abode this morning, after receiving such tokens of friendship\r\nas Easter eggs and artistic picture cards, I attended an Easter service\r\nat the London University Hall and heard the little choir of four voices\r\nrendering mellifluous anthems to the glory of God.  At the invitation\r\nof the Rev. R. P. Campbell this afternoon I went to Lloyds Park\r\nto tell the P.S.A. there about a South African Easter and to deliver\r\nat the same time the native message to the British public.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I went to the City Temple, where I listened to\r\nan intellectual Easter sermon, by the Rev. R. J. Campbell,\r\non the triumph of Christianity, and heard the uniformed choir\r\nartistically sing doxologies to the risen Christ.\r\n\r\nAs I recall these services, I am transported in thought\r\nto St. Martin's Church in the heart of the \"Free\" State,\r\n6,000 miles away, where thirty-seven years ago, as an unconscious babe\r\nin my godmother's arms, I went through my first religious sacrament,\r\nperformed by an aged missionary who made the sign of the cross\r\non my forehead and on my breast.  I think also of another church\r\non the banks of the Vaal River where, over twenty years ago,\r\nanother missionary laid his white hands on my curly head and received my vow\r\nto forsake the Devil and all his works.  I know that in these two places,\r\nas well as in all other native churches and chapels throughout\r\nSouth Africa, native congregations have this day been singing\r\nin their respective houses of worship and in a variety of tongues\r\nabout the risen Christ.  But thinking also of the lofty spires\r\nof the Dutch Reformed churches in the South African towns and dorps,\r\nI am forced to remember that coloured worshippers are excluded from them.\r\nStill, in these churches as well, Dutch men and Dutch women have this day\r\nbeen singing of the triumphs of the risen Christ.  Yet to-morrow\r\nsome of these white worshippers, in the workshops and in the parks,\r\nwill be expressing an opposite sentiment to that conveyed\r\nin their songs of praise, namely, \"Down with the verdoemde schepsels\"\r\n(damned black creatures) -- the Natives -- for whom also,\r\nthese white worshippers say, Christ died.\r\n\r\nThe Infant Christ, when King Herod sought to murder Him,\r\nfound an asylum in Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Messiah, having been scourged, mocked, and forced to bear His cross\r\nup to Golgotha, and sinking under its weight, an African,\r\nby name Simon of Cyrene, relieved Him of the load.\r\n\r\nTo-day British troops are suffering untold agony in the trenches\r\nin a giant struggle for freedom.  In this stupendous task\r\nthey are assisted by sable Africans from the British, French,\r\nand Belgian colonies of the Dark Continent, thus fulfilling\r\nthe Biblical prophecy, \"From Africa (Egypt) I have called my son.\"\r\nBut other Africans, again, are debarred by the South African Constitution\r\non account of their colour from doing their share in this war of redemption.\r\nThis prohibition surely carries the conviction that the native complaint\r\nagainst the South African Constitution is something more\r\nthan a mere sentimental grievance.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers are telling us of \"a growing spirit of justice\r\nin South Africa\"; but in the face of what is happening to-day,\r\nthe Natives are wondering if the word `justice', in this newspaper allegation,\r\nis not a misprint for `hatred', for up till as late as 1914\r\nwhole congregations have been arrested on leaving some of their farm chapels\r\non \"Free\" State and Transvaal farms.  They had their passes in their pockets,\r\nbut the police contended that they had no special permits,\r\nsigned by the landowners on whose farms the chapels are situated,\r\nto attend divine service at the particular places of worship\r\non that particular day, and the courts upheld this contention.\r\nUp to five years ago no such sacrilegious proceedings interfered\r\nwith the Sunday attendances of native worshippers in the same country,\r\nso that there is no mistake as to the kind of spirit that is\r\n\"growing in South Africa\".\r\n\r\n     *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nWhen a man comes to you with stories about a \"growing spirit of justice\r\nin South Africa\", ask him if he knows that in 1884 there was a great debate\r\nin the Cape Parliament as to whether Natives should be permitted\r\nto exercise the franchise, and that the ayes had it.  Ask him, further,\r\nif he thinks that such a proposal could ever be entertained to-day\r\nby any South African Parliament.  If he is honest, he will be bound\r\nto say \"no\".  Then ask him, \"Where is your growing spirit of justice?\"\r\n\r\n     *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nIn 1909, a South African Governor made a great speech in which\r\n  he declaimed against the South African policy of pinpricking the blacks.\r\n\r\nIn 1911, another South African Governor authorized the publication\r\n  of regulations in which, by prohibiting the employment of coloured artisans\r\n  on the South African mines, the pinpricks were accentuated.\r\n\r\nIn 1913, a South African Governor signed the Natives' Land Act\r\n  which made the Natives homeless in South Africa.  Whereas the Government\r\n  have announced their intention not to disfranchise the South African rebels,\r\n  judging from the present legislative tendency we fear that,\r\n  unless the Imperial Government can be induced to interfere,\r\n  it is not improbable that should the rebels return to power\r\n  after the general election\r\n\r\nIn 1916, there will be horrible enactments in store for the blacks.\r\n\r\n     *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nIn 1906, His Majesty's Government gave the Transvaal Colony\r\n  self-government under a constitution which included a clause placing\r\n  the voteless native taxpayers under the special protection of the Crown.\r\n\r\nIn 1907, His Majesty's Government likewise gave the Orange River Colony\r\n  (now Orange \"Free\" State) self-government under a constitution\r\n  which contained a similar provision.  At this time the Governor of Natal,\r\n  as representing the King, was Supreme Chief of the Zulus in that Colony.\r\n  The Natives lived happily under these protecting reservations,\r\n  and the white people had no complaint against the just restraint\r\n  of the Imperial suzerainty.\r\n\r\nIn 1909, His Majesty's Government passed the Union Constitution, sweeping away\r\n  all these safeguards.  In that Act they practically told South Africa to do\r\n  what she liked with the Natives in these three Colonies and South Africa\r\n  is doing it.  Where, then, is this \"growing spirit\"?\r\n\r\n     *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nDuring the South African War in 1901, the Imperial Government\r\n  informed the Federal (Dutch) Government that no peace terms\r\n  could be considered which did not extend to the native races\r\n  the same privileges -- the rights of the franchise -- which are enjoyed\r\n  by the Natives of the Cape Colony.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, the British Imperial and Dutch representatives signed the Peace terms\r\n  at Vereeniging.  In these, the rights of the coloured citizens\r\n  were postponed till after the old Republics had responsible Government.\r\n  Responsible Government has since been granted, and has in turn\r\n  been succeeded by the Union.  But when the Imperial Parliament,\r\n\r\nIn 1909, considered the Act of Union, English and Dutch South Africans\r\n  came over and represented to the Imperial authorities that there would be\r\n  a striking demonstration (or words to that effect) against the federation,\r\n  and even against South Africa's relation to the Mother Country\r\n  if native rights were as much as mentioned in the Constitution;\r\n  and the South African Native Franchise has now receded as far off\r\n  as the Greek calends.  So where is that \"growing spirit of justice\"?\r\n\r\n     *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nWhen you speak of converting Mohammedans, let the question be asked:\r\n\"What must Mohammedans think of those whose religion having said\r\n`In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread,' they nevertheless\r\nuphold the policy of rulers who pass regulations debarring\r\none section of the community from following an honest occupation\r\nin their native land?  And what impression must be created\r\nin the minds of black converts who are subjected to discriminations,\r\nincluding prohibitions that were not in existence five years ago?\"\r\n\r\nAnd if in spite of beautiful voices that I have heard this Easter Sunday\r\nsinging anthems concerning the triumph of the kingdom of love the British flag\r\ncontinues to defend the policy of repression and colour hatred\r\nin South Africa, then I fear that the black victims of this policy,\r\nmany of them converted to Christianity through your efforts,\r\nmight very well class your Easter anthems and their great teaching\r\nwith the newspaper canard relative to a \"growing spirit of justice\r\nin South Africa\"; for our bitter experience proves that spirit to be at best\r\nbut a dwindling one.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago I was alarmed by the impious utterances of a coloured man\r\nwhose friendship I valued.  He being influential among our people,\r\nI gently remonstrated with him lest through his action many of our people\r\nbecome unsettled in their faith.  This was his explanation:\r\nHe was going along an East Rand suburb at eleven o'clock one Sunday morning\r\nwhen the bells were ringing.  He saw a number of people entering\r\na Dutch church, and as he was far from home he mingled with them,\r\nintending to spend the hour at worship instead of continuing his walk.\r\nBut no sooner was he inside than the usher jostled him out of the church,\r\nhailed a policeman and handed him in charge, so that he spent the next hour\r\nin the charge office instead of at chapel.  On the Monday morning\r\nhe was convicted by the East Rand Magistrate and fined 1 Pound\r\nfor trespassing on a private place, to wit, a church.\r\nAnd that was a Dutch Reformed church, the State Church of South Africa.\r\nOthers had reproached him before me for such utterances, he said,\r\nbut he will have \"no more of our religious mockery with its theoretical\r\n`Come unto Me' and its practical `1 Pound or a month with hard labour'.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Ruskin, writing on `State Intervention', says:\r\n\r\n==\r\n\"When a peasant mother sees one of her careless children fall into a ditch,\r\nher first proceeding is to pull him out; her second, to box his ears;\r\nher third, ordinarily, to lead him carefully a little way by the hand,\r\nor send him home for the rest of the day.  The child usually cries,\r\nand very often would clearly prefer remaining in the ditch;\r\nand if he understood any of the terms of politics, would certainly\r\nexpress resentment at the interference with his individual liberty:\r\nbut the mother has done her duty.\"\r\n==\r\n\r\nRuskin goes further and depicts the calamities of a mother nation which,\r\nlike a foxhunter, complies with the request of its daughter nations\r\n\"to be left in muddy independence.\"*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* `Political Economy of Art':  Addenda (J. E., Section 127).\r\n--\r\n\r\nLet us appeal to you, in conclusion, to remember that the victorious Christ\r\n\"has gathered your people into a great nation, and sent them\r\nto sow beside all waters and multiply sure dwellings on the earth. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Let not the crown of your pride be as a fading flower.\r\nBut be equal to your high trust:  reverent in the use of freedom,\r\njust in the exercise of power, and generous in the protection of the weak.\"\r\n\r\n     *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nThis has been the most strenuous winter that the writer has ever experienced:\r\na dark, dreary winter of almost continuous rains, snowflakes, cold,\r\nmud and slush.  Reading of the severity of English winters at a distance,\r\nI never could have realized that the life I have lived in England\r\nduring the past four months was possible.  An existence from which\r\nthe sun's rays are almost always obliterated by the inclement weather,\r\nby snow and by fog.  I cannot describe the sensations caused\r\nby the dismal gloom of the sunless days -- a most depressing life --\r\nespecially in December, when it would suddenly turn dark,\r\ncompelling one to work by gaslight when the clocks indicated\r\nthat it was high noon.  Not till then did I realize why some people are said\r\nto worship the sun.  I find that I have unlearned my acquaintance with\r\nthe larger planets and heavenly bodies (a knowledge acquired since boyhood)\r\nbecause the winter fog and clouds have continually hidden the moon and stars\r\nfrom view.\r\n\r\n     *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nBut now that the country is throwing off its winter cloak and dressing itself\r\nin its green, gorgeous array; now that King Day shines in all his glory\r\nthrough the mist by day, and the moon and stars appear in their brilliancy\r\nin the evenings; now that, as if in harmony with the artistic rendering\r\nof Easter anthems by your choirs, the thrush and the blackbird twitter forth\r\nthe disappearance of the foggy winter with its snow, sleet and wet;\r\nnow that the flocks of fleecy sheep, which for the past four months\r\nhave been in hiding and conspicuous by their absence,\r\ncome forward again and spread triumphantly over the green\r\nas if in celebration of the dawn of the new spring;\r\nnow that the violet and the daffodil, the marguerite and the hyacinth,\r\nthe snowdrop and the bluebell, glorious in appearance, also announce,\r\neach in its own way, the advent of sunny spring, we are encouraged\r\nto hope that, \"when peace again reigns over Europe\", when white men\r\ncease warring against white men, when the warriors put away\r\nthe torpedoes and the bayonets and take up less dangerous implements, you will\r\nin the interest of your flag, for the safety of your coloured subjects,\r\nthe glory of your Empire, and the purity of your religion, grapple with\r\nthis dark blot on the Imperial emblem, the South African anomaly\r\nthat compromises the justice of British rule and seems almost to belie\r\nthe beauty, the sublimity and the sincerity of Christianity.\r\n\r\nShall we appeal to you in vain?

You can start and move\r\n    in that direction to a certain extent, but you will be driven back\r\n    by the exigencies of a law that operates outside the laws of Parliament --\r\n    the law of supply and demand.\r\n\r\n  This theory of segregation is to some minds attractive,\r\n    but the forgotten point is that you need the Native.\r\n    You cannot segregate him because you need him.  If you drive him\r\n    out of his existing life and occupation, you run a great risk\r\n    that you will lose many of your Natives.\r\n                   Hon. W. P. Schreiner, K.C., C.M.G.,\r\n                     (High Commissioner for the Union of South Africa,\r\n                     Ex-Premier of Cape Colony,) before the Lands Commission.\r\n\r\n  If we are to deal fairly with the Natives of this country,\r\n    then according to population we should give them\r\n    four-fifths of the country, or at least half.\r\n                                       Hon. C. G. Fichardt, M.L.A.\r\n\r\n  The best way to segregate the races would be by means of a boundary fence\r\n    along the main line of Railway from Port Elizabeth,\r\n    straight through to Bloemfontein and Pretoria, to Pietersburg,\r\n    putting the blacks on one side and the whites on the other side\r\n    of the Railway line.*\r\n                   M. J. M. Nyokong, before the Native Affairs Commission.\r\n\r\n  --\r\n  * This would give about one-third of the Union to the four and a half\r\n    million blacks, the one and a quarter million whites retaining two-thirds.\r\n  --\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the past two years while the Empire was involved in\r\none of the mightiest struggles that ever shook the foundations of the earth,\r\nSouth Africa was wasting time and money in a useless and unprecedented attempt\r\nat territorial segregation betwixt white and black.  Judging by\r\nthe recently published Report of the Lands Commission, however,\r\nshe has failed ignominiously in the task.\r\n\r\nWhenever, on behalf of the Natives, the hardships disclosed in this book\r\nwere mentioned, the South African authorities invariably replied\r\nthat these hardships would cease as soon as the Commission submits its Report.\r\nThis has now been done.  General Botha laid the Report\r\non the table of the house on May 3, 1916, and intimated as he did so\r\nthat \"the Government propose to take no immediate action\r\nupon the recommendations, but will give the country twelve months to consider\r\nthe Report and the evidence.\"  Meanwhile the eviction of Natives from farms\r\ncontinues in all parts of the country, and the Act debars them\r\nfrom settling anywhere, not even in Natal, although Natal witnesses\r\n(like the Chairman of the Commission) have definitely claimed\r\nthe exemption of their Colony from this form of Union tyranny.\r\n\r\nIt is a Report of many parts.  A good deal of it is instructive and much of it\r\nis absurd.  Most of the Commissioners and many of the witnesses have\r\nexpressed themselves with a candid disregard for the rights of other people.\r\n\r\nGovernment publications, at least, should be beyond question;\r\nthus, old Government archives give correct histories of native tribes\r\nfor 500 years back, because their compilers invariably sought and obtained\r\nreliable evidence from Natives about themselves.  But this Commission's Report\r\n(to mention but one instance among several inaccuracies) tells us,\r\non page 27 of U.G. 25-'16, of \"the original inhabitants of Moroka ward\r\nwho had lived in Bechuanaland under the Paramount Chief Montsioa (sic).\r\nTheir original chief was Sebuclare\" (!)\r\n\r\nNo Barolong tribe ever had a chief by this name.  The fact is,\r\nthat Governments of to-day frequently publish unreliable native records,\r\nfor they are mainly based on information obtained from self-styled experts,\r\nwho, in South Africa, should always be white.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is not explained why the Commission publishes,\r\nin a permanent record, particulars of encumbrances on native farms\r\nsuch as we find on page 29 of the same volume.  Is it to damage\r\nthe credit of the native farmers?  Supposing some of the hypothecations given\r\nin the \"list of mortgaged native-owned farms in the Thaba Ncho District\"\r\nwere wiped off before the Report was issued, will it be fair\r\nto the native owners to read, say in 1999, that their farms are mortgaged\r\nfor those amounts?\r\n\r\nIn the published evidence given before other Commissions\r\nquestions put to the witnesses are usually printed along with the answers.\r\nThis has not been done in the present instance, and consequently\r\nsome of these replies are so clumsily put that the reader cannot even guess\r\nwhat the witness was answering.  If the questions had also been printed,\r\nthe whole Report might have been illuminating.  It is interesting,\r\nfor instance, to read what was apparently a lively dispute\r\nbetween the Commissioners and one witness -- Mr. J. G. Keyter, M.L.A.,\r\nthe arch-enemy of the blacks and one of the promoters of the whole trouble --\r\nas to what is, or is not, the meaning of the Natives' Land Act.\r\nIndeed the various definitions and explanations of the Act,\r\ngiven by the Commissioners and some of the witnesses, contradict those\r\npreviously given by the Union Government and Mr. Harcourt.\r\nAnd while the ruling whites, on the one hand, content themselves\r\nwith giving contradictory definitions of their cruelty the native sufferers,\r\non the other hand, give no definitions of legislative phrases\r\nnor explanations of definitions.  All that they give expression to\r\nis their bitter suffering under the operation of what their experience\r\nhas proved to be the most ruthless law that ever disgraced\r\nthe white man's rule in British South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Report and the evidence at any rate bear out the statement\r\nset forth in this book, namely, that the main object in view\r\nis not segregation, but the reduction of all the black subjects of the King\r\nfrom their former state of semi-independence to one of complete serfdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Commission's Awards\r\n\r\nThe population of South Africa is very commonly overestimated.\r\nAs a matter of fact there are in South Africa about\r\none and a quarter million whites and four and a half million blacks.\r\nAccording to the Census of 1911, the exact figure is a million less\r\nthan the population of London, -- viz., 5,973,394 -- scattered over\r\nan area of 143,000,000 morgen -- nearly ten times the size of England.\r\nA morgen is about 2 1/9 English acres.\r\n\r\nBut if we are to understand what is proposed, we would have to consider\r\nthe position in the sub-continent under different heads: --\r\n\r\n  I.   English or Urban Areas, inhabited by 660,000 whites and 800,000 blacks:\r\n       1 3/4 quarter million morgen; and\r\n\r\n  II.  The remaining 141 1/4 million morgen, which the Commission\r\n       would divide as follows: --\r\n\r\n       (a)  NATIVE AREAS, for the Bantu and such other coloured races as are\r\n            classed along with them numbering just about 4,000,000 SOULS:\r\n            18 1/4 MILLION MORGEN.\r\n\r\n       (b)  EUROPEAN AREAS, or nearly the whole of Rural South Africa,\r\n            for the occupation of 660,000 RURAL WHITES (mainly Boers):\r\n            123,000,000 MORGEN.\r\n\r\nThe English Areas (I) are not affected by the troubles which form\r\nthe subject of this book.  None but the four million blacks will be allowed\r\nto buy land in the Native Area (II(a)); while all the blacks\r\nwho hitherto lived on the Boer Areas (II(b)) must clear out.\r\nThey would only be allowed to come back to Union territory\r\nas servants to the white farming population.\r\n\r\nThat, in a nutshell, is the Report of the Segregation Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Chairman Dissents\r\n\r\nOn the whole these drastic findings are against the weight of evidence.\r\nThe Report, moreover, shows that the decisions were not carried through\r\nwithout some difference of opinion.  It would seem that Sir William Beaumont,\r\nthe Chairman of the Commission, a retired Judge of the Supreme Court\r\n(whose legal training and experience were assuredly entitled to more respect\r\nthan they received) gave a saner interpretation of the Natives' Land Act.\r\nHe evidently wished to treat the amount of land awarded to Natives\r\nas an instalment to which additions might be made in the future.\r\nThis, he said, was quite within the power of the Commission to recommend.\r\nBut his colleagues presumably preferred, not the legal,\r\nbut their own interpretation, namely, that this sane interpretation was\r\n\"contrary to the intention of the legislature\".  The Chairman's well-weighed\r\njudicial verdict appears on page 42 of volume one of the Report: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nIn my opinion, neither the Natives' Land Act, nor the terms of its reference,\r\nrequire the Commission to delimit the whole extent of the Union\r\ninto European and Native Areas respectively . . . and I think\r\nit is quite competent for this Commission, where this cannot\r\nbe conveniently done, to leave undefined areas which would be open alike\r\nto white and black for the acquisition of land.  But this opinion\r\nis not shared by my fellow-commissioners, who regard it as contrary\r\nto the intentions of the legislature and the terms of the Act.\r\n==\r\n\r\nSir William Beaumont's rejected opinion is supported by\r\nthe evidence of Senator T. L. Schreiner, who said: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nWhen the Bill was before the House, I brought to its notice the fact\r\nthat there were areas in the country which it was impossible to declare\r\nnative areas or non-native areas.  The late Minister said\r\nit was not the intention to divide the whole country of the Union;\r\ntherefore I thought that the difficulty was covered (p. 224 vol. ii).\r\n==\r\n\r\nBut as in Parliament so also in the Commission it would appear\r\nthat the steam-roller was set in motion; and it operated in each instance\r\nin favour of repressing the black races.\r\n\r\nThese four Commissioners presumably thinking that Imperial attention\r\nwould be too much engrossed with the war to notice such insignificant affairs\r\nas the throttling of the South African Blacks, seem to have decided\r\nthat now or never was the opportune moment for degrading the aborigines\r\ninto helots; therefore, the Chairman, finding that he could not persuade\r\nhis colleagues to adopt his view of things, indited the following\r\nminority report respecting his own Province of Natal and Zululand\r\n(vol. i. p. 41): --\r\n\r\n==\r\nThe conditions in Natal are, and have been, totally different\r\nto those in the other Provinces.  There has been no demand in Natal\r\nfor the enforcement of a Squatters Act or for any further\r\nsegregation of the natives.  Indeed, the opinion of Natal, as expressed\r\nin the evidence given before the Commission by those best qualified to know,\r\nis against the application of the Natives' Land Act to Natal.\r\n\r\nIn Natal, since it became a British possession, the Natives have always had,\r\nand largely exercised, the right to purchase land outside\r\ntheir defined locations, and they regard any infringement of this right\r\nas a breach of the terms of the Proclamation issued by Her late Majesty\r\nQueen Victoria at the time the country was annexed by Great Britain.\r\n(See the petitions presented to the Commission.)  The Natives in Natal\r\nnow privately own about 359,000 acres, on which are residing\r\nsome 37,000 Natives.  These lands are, in certain areas,\r\nso intermixed with lands owned by Europeans that any line of demarcation\r\ncan only be arbitrarily made, and may result in serious hardship or injustice\r\nto both European and Native owners.\r\n\r\nThe area set aside for native occupation (including mission reserves)\r\nand preserved for their use by Royal Letters Patent and by\r\nthe South Africa Act, amount to nearly two and a half million acres,\r\nor about 15 per cent. of the whole of Natal.  These areas are,\r\naccording to the native mode of occupation, almost all fully occupied,\r\nand do not afford more than a very limited opportunity\r\nfor the introduction of Natives from outside.\r\n\r\nA further point which has to be considered, and it is one\r\non which the Natives lay great stress, is that it seems unjust\r\nto debar the native from purchasing land in areas where the Indian,\r\nwho is alien to the country, is free to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Zululand\r\n\r\nAs regards Zululand, it is sufficient here to point out\r\nthat Zululand was delimited into native reserves and Crown lands\r\nby the Zululand Delimitation Commission of 1902-1904,\r\nthe Crown lands being made available for disposal by the Natal Government,\r\nto which the country was annexed.  It was not, however, intended,\r\nnor did the Zulus understand, that they were to be deprived of their right\r\nto acquire any portion of the reserved Crown lands by purchase.\r\n\r\nThe delimitation was made after a very thorough inquiry\r\nby persons well acquainted with the Zulus and their country;\r\nbut, even so, we find that whole tribes or large portions of tribes\r\nwho had long been in occupation of their lands -- some of which\r\nwere not acquired by conquest but by voluntary surrender --\r\nwere not provided for, and were left on the reserved Crown lands.\r\nThere are to-day some 24,328 Zulus and Amatonga occupying these lands,\r\nand they are asking to-day for their lands to be restored to them.\r\nThe delimitation was acquiesced in by the Zulus only because\r\nthey had no alternative, and the inevitable had to be accepted.\r\nSince the delimitation they have remained loyal and peaceful\r\nand the bitterness of the losses suffered is past.\r\n\r\nThe Delimitation Commission in its report expressed the hope\r\nthat the delimitation would be:  \"as final a settlement\r\nas it is possible to effect, and that no further changes\r\nwill be initiated in the near future . . .\"; but if the question\r\nis now re-opened and European and native areas are defined anew,\r\nI think endless trouble is likely to ensue.  If any alterations may be found\r\nnecessary in the future, either in the interests of black or white,\r\nthe machinery exists whereby such alteration can be effected\r\nwith little or no disturbance of the natives.\r\n==\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Colonel Stanford Reverses His Views\r\n\r\nOne redeeming feature in a Report which otherwise is melancholy reading\r\nis to be found in the consistency of the statesmen of Natal,\r\nwhich is admirable in comparison with the fast degenerating land policy\r\nof Cape Statesmen.  Ten years ago the Native Affairs Commission\r\nreported on the question of Land Tenure in South Africa.\r\nMessrs. Marshall Campbell and S. O. Samuelson, Natal representatives\r\non that Commission -- ably supported by Colonel Stanford,\r\nthe Cape representative -- expressed themselves unambiguously against\r\nthis limitation of native progress.  History was about to repeat itself\r\nin favour of justice in the latest Commission but for the manner\r\nin which Colonel Stanford completely reversed his former attitude.\r\nHe is the only member of this Commission who had a seat\r\non the first Commission, and in 1905 he was reported thus: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nCol. Stanford dissented from the view of the majority\r\non the question of restricting to certain areas only\r\nthe right of the individual Native to purchase land.  He holds that\r\nthe acquisition by the more advanced Natives of vested individual interests\r\nin the land is a powerful incentive to loyalty.  In his opinion\r\nsufficient cause has not been shown for the curtailment of privileges\r\nenjoyed for many years in the British Colonies. . . .\r\n\r\nThe contention that the safety of European races must be guarded\r\nby such restrictions as have been under discussion he does not hold\r\nto be sound.  The Church, professions, commerce, trade and labour\r\nare open to the ambition and energy of the Natives, and with so many avenues\r\nopen to their advance the danger of their swamping Europeans, if a real one,\r\nis not avoided by denying them the right individually to buy land.\r\n\r\nHe can see no decadence of the vigour, the enterprise and the courage which,\r\nsince the occupation of the Cape Peninsula by the early Dutch settlers,\r\nhave resulted in the extension of European control and occupation\r\nto the limits now reached.  Moreover, artificial restrictions\r\nof the occupation of land in the late Dutch Republics\r\nresulted in the evasion of the law by various forms of contract\r\nwhereby native occupation of farms was effected, while at the same time\r\nadvantage was taken of the opportunities thus afforded of fraudulent practices\r\non the part of Europeans employed as agents or so-called trustees. . . .\r\n\r\nIf the design be to allow purchase by Natives in localities\r\nregarded as unsuitable for Europeans, sight is lost of the fact\r\nthat usually the Native who desires to become a landed proprietor\r\nbelongs to the civilized class, and such localities offer to him\r\nno attraction.\r\n\r\nEuropeans are more and more entering into occupation of land regarded\r\nas set aside for Natives.  Missionaries, traders and others are permitted\r\nto establish themselves and carry on the duties of their respective callings.\r\nTownships spring up at the various seats of magistracy and Census Returns\r\nclearly show that such influx is steadily increasing in volume.\r\nIt is thus demonstrated that the idea of separate occupation of land\r\nby Natives, even in their own Reserves, is not maintained at the present time,\r\nnor can it be in the future.*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* `Colonies and British Possessions -- Africa (Session 1905)',\r\n  vol. lv. pp. 102-103.\r\n--\r\n==\r\n\r\nBut now we must conclude that the gallant Colonel has fallen a victim\r\nto the new reactionary spirit, for he has deserted Sir W. Beaumont,\r\nthe Natal Commissioner, and taken up with the Northerners,\r\na position diametrically opposed to the noble sentiments he then laid down.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Cape Land Policy\r\n\r\nThe pronounced inconsistency of the Cape representative on these Commissions\r\nis in harmony with the reaction which has set in as regards\r\nthe Land Policy of the Cape.  It is true that the Cape, so far,\r\nhas been more liberal in the matter of the Franchise.  And the very fact\r\nthat some of the Cape voters' lists included some native names\r\nhas had a restraining influence on the utterances of certain\r\nCape members of Parliament who would otherwise have given expression\r\nto reactionary sentiments.  But it is no less true that in later years\r\nthe same native Franchise has been hypocritically used as a cloak\r\nto cover a multitude of political sins, such, for instance, as free trade\r\nin liquor among the Natives and the systematic robbery of native lands.\r\nTo my own personal knowledge, the Cape Government have on several occasions,\r\narbitrarily, on the slightest pretext, or none whatever, confiscated lands\r\nthat were awarded to native tribes by Imperial representatives,\r\nin the name of Queen Victoria, and parcelled them out to Europeans.\r\n\r\nA striking instance of such rapacity on the part of successive\r\nCape administrations appears on page 30 of the Minute by Sir William Beaumont,\r\nChairman of the Lands Commission.  Sir William shows how\r\nloyal black taxpayers in Griqualand West had been systematically\r\nrobbed of Queen Victoria's gifts and driven from pillar to post.\r\nCommission after Commission had been sent out to them\r\nat intervals of ten years, systematic spoliation and pillage following\r\nthe visit of each commission.  It has been my sorrow to be among those\r\nwho witnessed the coming and going of some of these decennial commissions\r\nand the truculent attitude of the Cape Government, who,\r\ntrading on the people's ignorance, treated Queen Victoria's awards\r\nlike so many scraps of paper, drove these tax-payers from their homes,\r\nand invited white men to occupy their territories.\r\n\r\nThis is what Sir William writes about the Commission of the last decade: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nThe case of these Natives calls for special consideration.  They were promised\r\nthat they would never be removed so long as they remained loyal,\r\nand in the end they were burnt out.  There is a very strong feeling\r\namongst them that there has been a want of faith towards them.\r\n\r\nThe subject was specially reported on by Mr. P. Dreyer,\r\nCivil Commissioner of Kimberley, on August 27, 1909.\r\nHe made specific recommendations, which appear to be quite sound,\r\nbut do not appear to have been adopted.\r\n==\r\n\r\nNow, this is only with reference to Griqualand West.  But similar\r\nacts of violence have marked the land-grabbing propensity of the Cape\r\nin Bechuanaland, in Peddie and the Transkei, even during my lifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The So-Called Native Areas\r\n\r\nTurning to the evidence, we find that if we omit the depositions\r\nof Natal whites, of Missionaries and of Natives, the remaining witnesses\r\n-- a minority of the whole -- emphatically declared that the aborigines\r\nwere not entitled to a square yard of their ancestral lands and that\r\nthey should be tolerated only as servants.  Those, at any rate, who thought\r\nthat we were entitled to some breathing space, were willing to concede\r\ncertain little \"reserves\" in the centre of groups of white men's farms,\r\ninto which black men and women could be herded like so many heads of cattle,\r\nrearing their offspring as best they could and preparing them\r\nfor a life of serfdom on the surrounding farm properties.\r\nThey held it to be the duty of the parent serfs to hand over their children,\r\nas soon as they were fit, to the farmers who would work them out;\r\nand when age and infirmity had rendered them unfit for further service,\r\nthey could be hustled back to the reserved pens, there to spend\r\nthe evening of their lives in raising more young serfs\r\nfor the rising white generation.  The Commission's findings\r\nseem to have been influenced largely by the latter type of white witness,\r\nfor all that they award us, in our ancestral South Africa,\r\nmight be called human incubators considering the amount of space.\r\n\r\nA contemplation of the circumstances attending these selfish recommendations\r\nleads one to wonder whether the Commissioners suffered from\r\nthe lack of a sense of humour or an undue excess of it.\r\nIn North and South America, for instance, we read that the slave-pens\r\nwere erected and maintained by the farmers at their own cost.\r\nThat \"the interest of the master demanded that he should direct\r\nthe general social and moral life of the slave, and should provide\r\nespecially for his physical well-being;\" but the pens proposed\r\nby the South African Land Commission, on the other hand, are to be maintained\r\nentirely by the slaves, at their own cost, the farmer's only trouble being\r\nto come to the gate and whistle for labourers.\r\n\r\nIt is lawful in certain parts of South Africa for Natives\r\nto dispose of or \"sell\" their daughters to men, the purchase price\r\nbeing sometimes fixed by the Government.  It is thus that white magistrates\r\nhave at times condemned unfortunate black girls to cohabit with men\r\nthey hated, provided the latter have paid the price; and having regard\r\nto the object for which the proposed native pens are to be set aside,\r\nthe reader can picture to himself the coming commercial traffic in black girls\r\nwithin the enclosures of the said \"native areas\".\r\n\r\nSeveral of the witnesses have made the statement that Natives are not making\r\neconomic use of the land.  As far as we have read, not one of such witnesses\r\nsupported his point with figures.  But most of those who expressed\r\nthe contrary view -- that native lands are shockingly overcrowded --\r\nhave backed their statements with figures.  Prominent among them,\r\nthere was Mr. Adamson, the Natal Magistrate.  In answer to further questions\r\nby Commissioner Wessels -- questions which this Report does not disclose --\r\nthe same witness also said:  \"I say the Location is crowded because\r\nthere are too many Natives for the ground, which is very poor and precipitous.\r\nIt is only down towards the valley where they can do a little cultivation.\r\nThe population is 12,368.\"\r\n\r\nOther magistrates and farmers gave similar evidence regarding their districts.\r\nThey included Mr. J. S. Smit, the Klerksdorp Magistrate,\r\nwho incidentally exploded the stale old falsehood about Natives living\r\non the labour of their wives.  The Rev. J. L. Dube said inter alia:\r\n\"It is a fact that none can deny that the white man has got the best land.\r\nIn the Free State you can go for miles without seeing anything;\r\nbut if it had been native land there would have been an outcry,\r\n`Look at this beautiful land, and the Kaffirs not cultivating it.'\r\nGoing to Johannesburg by the mail from here any day one can see waste land\r\nbelonging to white people.\"\r\n\r\nMr. E. T. Stubbs, Commissioner of Louis Trichardt, said:  \"The density\r\nof the native population on reserves is 106 to 177 per square mile;\r\non white farms only 28, and on Crown land 3 to the square mile.\"\r\nYet in the face of these and similar official figures,\r\nthe Commission reiterates the unsupported allegation of prejudiced witnesses\r\nthat \"Natives are not making economic use of their land.\"\r\nBut on turning to the Census figures one sees at once how unfounded\r\nis the repeated charge.  Take only one of the Provinces -- Cape Colony --\r\nin which it is said the Natives hold (and therefore \"waste\") the most land.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Province of the Cape of Good Hope\r\n\r\nCape Colony is about 83 3/4 million morgen in extent.  It is usually\r\nreferred to as: --\r\n\r\n  (a)  THE COLONY PROPER:  78,800,000 MORGEN, feeding 560,000 WHITES\r\n       and 1,090,000 BLACKS, with their 1,603,625 cattle,\r\n       240,000 horses and 20 million sheep and goats; and\r\n\r\n  (b)  THE TRANSKEIAN NATIVE TERRITORIES:  5,000,000 MORGEN,\r\n       feeding 20,000 WHITES and 900,000 BLACKS, with their\r\n       1,111,700 cattle, 90,000 horses, 3 1/2 million sheep and goats,\r\n       and more poultry and pigs than in the Colony Proper.\r\n\r\nSurely, no further mathematical demonstration is needed to show\r\non which side of the Kei there is a waste of land, if any.\r\nBut it is a maxim in South Africa that, except as mechanical contrivances,\r\nNatives do not count, and cattle in their possession are not live-stock;\r\nthus the districts in which they eke out an existence\r\nare so much derelict land.  The Commission, therefore,\r\npropose the following alterations: --\r\n\r\nThe 20,000 whites in the Transkei must not be disturbed.  A million morgen\r\nin the Transkei is set aside for them, and it shall be unlawful\r\nfor the blacks to live there except as servants.  On the other hand\r\nthe million odd Natives in the Colony Proper must betake themselves\r\nto the remainder of the Transkei, with their cattle and other belongings.\r\nA million morgen of Kalahari sand-dunes, worthless for farming purposes,\r\nand the small tribal communes near Queenstown and King Williamstown,\r\nare also set aside as native areas.  And then the whole of Cape Colony\r\n(supposing the Commission's extraordinary recommendations be enforced)\r\nwill balance itself as follows: --\r\n\r\n  (a)  EUROPEAN AREAS:  76,392,503 MORGEN, feeding 560,000 WHITES,\r\n       their 1,030,000 CATTLE, 180,300 HORSES AND 15 MILLION\r\n       SHEEP AND GOATS.\r\n\r\n  (b)  NATIVE AREAS:  7,356,590 MORGEN, feeding 1,500,000 BLACKS,\r\n       with their 1,580,000 HEAD OF CATTLE, 154,630 HORSES AND 8 MILLION\r\n       SHEEP AND GOATS.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it would appear that these awards allotted\r\nsay 288 acres per white and 7 acres per black person;\r\nbut, as the bulk of the English (a quarter of a million)\r\nlive in towns and are not affected by this trouble,\r\nwe may deduct the Urban districts and their white and black populations.\r\nThen the Commission's allotments really work out at about 589.31 acres\r\nper Boer (man, woman or child) and only 10.3 acres per Native.\r\nAnd even then, this would be by no means the limit of the disproportion.\r\nAppendix VIII (Annexure I) of the same Report recommends\r\nfuture inroads by whites upon these attenuated native reservations,\r\nbut, to the blacks, there is to be no territorial compensation\r\nfrom the Colony, which an adoption of all these recommendations\r\nwould practically depopulate.\r\n\r\nAs things are at present, the black population of these areas\r\nis as much as 70 to 90 persons to the square mile.  In density of population,\r\nsome of these \"rural\" native districts are second only to Capetown,\r\nDurban, and Johannesburg -- South Africa's most populous centres.\r\nNot one of the other South African \"cities\" can show\r\na population of more than 20 to 30 persons to the square mile.\r\nSo that every individual inhabitant of a city occupies a larger space\r\nthan some of these native farmers can have for themselves,\r\ntheir livestock and agricultural pursuits.  So says the Census Report\r\n(U.G. 32-'12), which is fully borne out by the writer's own observations\r\nin a travelling experience of more than ten years.\r\n\r\nThe average density of the rural population in white areas\r\nis about five to eight persons per square mile.  In native areas\r\nthe average is ten times that number, while the black belt\r\nalong the Indian Ocean contains from 100 to 140 Natives per square mile\r\n(see Schedule F. and Tables XIII-XVI, of the Census Report).\r\nYet the Commission would saddle these congested native areas\r\nwith additional populations from the Colony Proper and raise the density\r\nto something over 200 souls per square mile.\r\n\r\nThe density of cattle to the square mile in Cape Colony\r\nis 6.39 in white areas, and 61.15 in native areas (see U.G. 32h. 1912.\r\npp. 1227-1228).  Adopt the Commission's Report and you will have\r\nin white areas 0.24 and in Native areas 163.26 cattle per square mile.\r\n\r\nIs it fair or reasonable that the indigenes of an open country\r\nwho pay taxation for the benefit of their rulers and not of themselves,\r\nshould be forced to live the overcrowded lives of the Belgians without\r\nBelgium's sanitary arrangements, or the precautionary hygienic measures\r\nnecessary in other thickly populated areas?\r\n\r\nIs it natural that their cattle should be subjected to this\r\nstarvation process, while the grassy tracts of their God-given territories\r\nare mainly untenanted and preserved as breeding grounds\r\nfor venomous snakes and scorpions?\r\n\r\nHas it come to this that the standard of our unfortunate country\r\nhas sunk so low that dog-in-the-manger stories are now read\r\nin Parliamentary publications?\r\n\r\nIt is clear that under the proposed arrangement native cattle must starve\r\nand their owners with them.  For it has come out in evidence\r\nthat even now (while many Europeans hold large tracts of idle land)\r\nsome of the blacks have not enough grazing for their stock.\r\nBut that little difficulty the Commission solves by proposing\r\nthat Natives should be taught to give up cattle breeding,\r\nwhich alone stands between them and the required serfdom!\r\n\r\nAn African home without its flock and herd is like an English home\r\nwithout its bread-winner.\r\n\r\n==\r\n\"Von Franzius considers Africa the home of the house cattle\r\nand the Negro the original tamer. . . .  Among the great Bantu tribes\r\nextending from the Soudan toward the South, cattle are evidence of wealth;\r\none tribe, for instance, having so many oxen that each village\r\nhad ten or twelve thousand head.  Lenz (1884), Bouet-Williaumez (1848),\r\nHecquard (1854), Bosman (1805), and Baker (1868) all bear witness\r\nto this, and Schweinfurth (1878) tells us of great cattle parks\r\nwith two to three thousand head, and of numerous agricultural\r\nand cattle-raising tribes . . . while Livingstone describes\r\nthe busy cattle raising of the Bantu and Kaffirs.\"*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* `The Negro' (Du Bois), pp. 108-109.\r\n--\r\n==\r\n\r\nBut the Commission would force us to give up our agrarian occupation\r\nwhen we are debarred by Acts of Parliament from following\r\nother profitable industries in our own country.  This is equivalent to saying\r\nthat Englishmen must be taught to close down their shops,\r\nstop their shipping industry and give up their maritime trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Orange \"Free\" State\r\n\r\nThe Provincial difficulties I have endeavoured to point out become\r\nmore serious when we regard the conditions in the so-called \"Free\" States.\r\nThere the native position is rendered exceptionally desperate\r\nby a number of rigorous class enactments.  Formerly these discriminating laws\r\nwere eased by the action of the State Presidents who were in the habit\r\nof issuing exemption certificates to Natives who wished to buy land,\r\neither from other Natives or from Europeans; but now, these harsh laws,\r\nbesides being rigidly enforced against all Natives, were made more acute\r\nin 1913, while there is no one in the position once occupied by the President,\r\nwho might be able or inclined to grant any relief.\r\n\r\nWhenever by force of character or sheer doggedness one Native has tried\r\nto break through the South African shackles of colour prejudice,\r\nthe Colour Bar, inserted in the South African Constitution in 1909,\r\ninstantly hurled him back to the lowest wrung of the ladder\r\nand held him there.  Let me mention only one such case.\r\n\r\nAbout ten years ago Mr. J. M. Nyokong, of the farm Maseru,\r\nin the Thabanchu district, invested about 1,000 Pounds\r\nin agricultural machinery and got a white man to instruct his nephews\r\nin its use.  I have seen his nephews go forth with a steam sheller,\r\nafter garnering his crops every year, to reap and thresh\r\nthe grain of the native peasants on the farms in his district.\r\nBut giving evidence before the Lands Commission two years ago,\r\nthis industrious black landowner stated that he had received\r\norders from the Government not to use his machinery except under\r\nthe supervision of a white engineer.  This order, he says,\r\ncompletely stopped his work.  The machinery is used only at harvesting time;\r\nno white man would come and work for him for two months only in the year,\r\nand as he cannot afford to pay one for doing nothing\r\nin the remaining ten months, his costly machinery is reduced\r\nto so much scrap iron.  This is the kind of discouragement and attrition\r\nto which Natives who seek to better their position are subjected\r\nin their own country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         The Native Affairs Department\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest puzzle in this ocean of native difficulties,\r\nto which one can but slightly refer in this chapter, is the attitude\r\nof some of the gentlemen in charge of the Native Affairs Department --\r\nthe only Branch of the South African administration run exclusively\r\non native taxes.  It is perhaps as well to cite one instance\r\nillustrative of their methods of administering native affairs.\r\nThe Rev. J. L. Dube, President of the Native Congress,\r\ngave evidence before the Lands Commission and produced letters\r\naddressed to him by certain Natal firms, from which I extract\r\nthe following passages: --\r\n\r\n==\r\nIf you are prepared to purchase this land my Company would be prepared\r\nto do business with you. . . .  In view of the fact that you and Cele\r\nhave already purchased portion of the Company's property adjoining the land\r\nnow offered for sale, we think there would be no objection\r\non the part of the Governor General in giving his consent to the transfer.*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* U.G. 22, p. 557.\r\n--\r\n==\r\n\r\nAnother extract runs: --\r\n\r\n==\r\n\"We have a piece of land at the edge of our estate cutting right into land\r\nowned by various Natives, and we are willing to dispose of this land to Cele\r\nfor this reason.  We understood that the Department of Native Affairs raised\r\nno objection, but we were astonished when everything was \"cut and dried\"\r\nto find them refusing the application.\"*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* U.G. 22, p. 557.\r\n--\r\n==\r\n\r\nHow then can the Native be expected to survive this organized opposition,\r\non the part of the authorities, and also of these official beneficiaries\r\nand prospective pensioners of native taxes?  Will it be believed\r\nthat these gentlemen of the Native Affairs Department, whose salaries\r\nare actually paid by us, should have sent messengers at our expense\r\nto convene a meeting of their colleagues, at which letters were dictated\r\nprohibiting the sale of this land to Zulus -- the stationery,\r\nthe typewriter and the typist's labour, to say nothing of the cigarettes\r\nsmoked by those present, being paid for out of native money?\r\n\r\nIs it surprising if we feel that their adverse interference in matters\r\nwhich so vitally affect us has long since become intolerable?\r\n\r\nIt may be asked what useful purpose is served by the Native Affairs Department\r\nas it now stands?  This would be my answer: --\r\n\r\nThe Department is responsible for the gathering in of all native taxes\r\nthroughout the Union.  And after paying the salaries of the staff,\r\nit pays over annually a huge surplus to the Union Exchequer\r\nfor the benefit of \"a white South Africa\".  Further, the Transvaal Natives\r\nbelieve that they would get along much better with the white population,\r\nand with officials of other Departments of State, were not\r\n\"the Native Affairs Department continually stirring them up against us.\"\r\nThe justice of this complaint is well exemplified at Johannesburg,\r\nwhere the autocrats of this department are armed with, and liberally exercise,\r\nthe peculiar and exceptional powers of locking up Natives without warrants,\r\nwithout any charge, and without a trial -- powers which even\r\nthe Judges of the Supreme Court do not possess.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           General Hertzog's Scheme\r\n\r\nIt may interest the reader to know that General Hertzog\r\nis the father of the segregation controversy.  The writer and other Natives\r\ninterviewed him before Christmas, 1912, at the Palace of Justice, Pretoria,\r\nwhen he was still in the ministry.  We had a two hours' discussion,\r\nin the course of which the General gave us a forecast of what he then regarded\r\nas possible native areas, and drew rings on a large wall-map of the Union\r\nto indicate their locality.  Included in these rings were several Magistracies\r\nwhich he said would solve a knotty problem.  He told us that white people\r\nobjected to black men in Government offices and magistrates in those areas\r\nwould have no difficulty in employing them.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hertzog was dismissed shortly after, and it has been said\r\nthat in order to placate his angry admirers the Ministry passed\r\nthe Natives' Land Act of which this Report is the outcome.\r\nJudging by the vigour with which the Union administration has been\r\nweeding Natives out of the public service and replacing them with Boers\r\nwithout waiting for the Commission's Report, it is clear\r\nthat they did not share General Hertzog's intention as regards\r\nthese magistracies.  I cannot recall all the magistracies\r\nwhich General Hertzog mentioned as likely to fall in native areas;\r\nbut I distinctly remember that Pietersburg and Thaba Nchu were among them;\r\nwhile Alice and Peddie (and possibly a neighbouring district)\r\nwere to be included in a southern reserve into which the Natives\r\nround East London and Grahamstown would have to move, the land vacated by them\r\nto be gradually occupied by the white settlers now scattered over the would-be\r\nnative block.  He went on to forecast a vast dependency of the Union\r\nin which the energies and aspirations of black professional men\r\nwould find their outlet with no danger of competition with Europeans;\r\nwhere a new educational and representative system could be evolved for Natives\r\nto live their own lives, and work out their salvation in a separate sphere.\r\nBut the lands Commission's Report places this plausible scheme beyond\r\nthe region of possibility, for no native area, recommended by this Commission,\r\nincludes any of the magistracies mentioned.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hertzog's plan at least offered a fair ground for discussion,\r\nbut the Commission's Report is a travesty of his scheme.\r\nIt intensifies every native difficulty and goes much further\r\nthan the wild demands of the \"Free\" State extremists.\r\nThus even if it be thrown out, as it deserves to be,\r\nfuture exploiters will always cite it as an excuse for measures\r\nsubversive of native well-being.  In fact, that such legislation\r\nshould be mooted is nothing short of a national calamity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       How They \"Doubled\" a Native Area\r\n\r\nNear the northern boundaries of Transvaal there lies\r\na stretch of malarial country in which nothing can live unless born there.\r\nMen and beasts from other parts visit it only in winter and leave it again\r\nbefore the rains begin, when the atmosphere becomes almost too poisonous\r\nto inhale.  Even the unfailing tax-gatherers of the Native Affairs Department\r\ngo there only in the winter every year and hurry back again\r\nwith the money bags before the malarial period sets in.\r\nA Boer general describes how when harassed by the Imperial forces\r\nduring the South African war, he was once compelled to march through it;\r\nand how his men and horses -- many of them natives of the Transvaal --\r\ncontracted enough malaria during the march to cause\r\nthe illness of many and the death of several Burghers and animals.\r\nOf the native inhabitants of this delectable area the Dutch General says:\r\n\"Their diminutive, deformed stature was another proof of the miserable climate\r\nobtaining there.\"*\r\n\r\n--\r\n* `My Reminiscences of the Anglo-Boer War' (General Ben Viljoen), p. 222.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen the Land Commissioners contemplated this \"salubrious\" region,\r\ntheir hearts must have melted with generosity, for whereas\r\nin our own healthy part of South Africa they have indicated\r\npossible native areas by little dots or microscopical rings\r\n(as in Thaba Nchu for instance), here, in this malarial area,\r\nthey marked off a reserve almost as wide as that described\r\nby General Hertzog himself at our Pretoria interview.  It is possibly\r\nin this way, and in such impossible places, that the Commission is alleged\r\nto have \"doubled\" the native areas.  In the rest of the country\r\nthey ask Parliament to confiscate our birthright to the soil of our ancestry\r\nin favour of 600,000 Boers and aliens whose languages can show\r\nno synonym for HOME -- the English equivalent of our IKAYA and LEGAE!\r\n\r\nThe Britishers' vocabulary includes that sacred word:  and that, perhaps,\r\nis the reason why their colonizing schemes have always allowed\r\nsome tracts of country for native family life, with reasonable opportunities\r\nfor their future existence and progress, in the vast South African expanses\r\nwhich God in His providence had created for His Children of the Sun.\r\nThe Englishman, moreover, found us speaking the word `Legae',\r\nand taught us how to write it.  In 1910, much against our will,\r\nthe British Government surrendered its immediate sovereignty over our land\r\nto Colonials and cosmopolitan aliens who know little about a Home,\r\nbecause their dictionaries contain no such loving term;\r\nand the recommendations of this Commission would seem to express\r\ntheir limited conception of the word and its beautiful significance.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Natives Have no Information about the Coming Servitude\r\n\r\nAll too little (if anything at all) is known of the services rendered\r\nto the common weal by the native leaders in South Africa.  In every crisis\r\nof the past four years -- and the one-sided policy of the Union\r\nhas produced many of these -- the native leaders have taken upon themselves\r\nthe thankless and expensive task of restraining the Natives\r\nfrom resorting to violence.  The seeming lack of appreciation\r\nwith which the Government has met their success in that direction\r\nhas been the cause of some comment among Natives.  On more than one occasion\r\nthey have asked whether the authorities were disappointed because,\r\nby their successful avoidance of bloodshed, the native leaders\r\nhad forestalled the machine guns.  But, be the reason what it may,\r\nthis apparent ingratitude has not cooled their ardour in the cause of peace.\r\n\r\nTo-day the Native Affairs Department has handed over 7,000 Pounds\r\nfrom native taxes to defray the cost of the Land Commission,\r\nconsisting of five white Commissioners, their white clerks and secretaries --\r\nthe printing alone swallowed up nearly 1,000 Pounds with further payments\r\nto white translators for a Dutch edition of the Report.\r\nBut not a penny could be spared for the enlightenment of the Natives\r\nat whose expense the inquiry has been carried through.\r\nThey have been officially told and had every reason to believe\r\nthat the Commission was going about to mark out reservations\r\nfor them to occupy and live emancipated from the prejudicial conditions\r\nthat would spring from contiguity with the white race.\r\nFor any information as to the real character of the contents\r\nof the Dutch and English Report of this Commission, they would\r\nhave to depend on what they could gather from the unsalaried efforts\r\nof the native leaders, who, owing to the vastness of the sub-continent,\r\nthe lack of travelling facilities and their own limited resources,\r\ncan only reach a few localities and groups.\r\n\r\nIt may be said with some reason that English leaders of thought\r\nin South Africa have had a task of like difficulty:  that they worked\r\njust as hard to get the English colonists to co-operate loyally\r\nwith a vanquished foe in whose hands the Union constitution has placed\r\nthe destiny of South Africa.  It could also be said with equal justice\r\nthat the Boer leaders' task has been not less difficult,\r\nthat it required their greatest tact to get the Boer majority\r\n-- now in power -- to deal justly with the English who had been responsible\r\nfor the elimination of the two Boer flags from among the emblems of\r\nthe family of nations.  But the difficulties of their task is not comparable\r\nto that of the native leaders.  English and Dutch Colonial leaders\r\nare members of Parliament, each in receipt of 400 Pounds a year,\r\nwith a free first class ticket over all systems of the South African Railways.\r\nThey enjoy, besides, the co-operation of an army of well-paid\r\nwhite civil servants, without whom they could scarcely have managed\r\ntheir own people.  The native leader on the other hand,\r\nin addition to other impediments, has to contend with\r\nthe difficulty of financing his own tours in a country\r\nwhose settled policy is to see that Natives do not make any money.\r\nHis position in his own country approximates to that of an Englishman,\r\ngrappling single-handed with complicated problems, on foreign soil,\r\nwithout the aid of a British consul.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Bullyragging the Natives\r\n\r\nFor upwards of three years the Government of the Union of South Africa\r\nhas harassed and maltreated the rural native taxpayers as no heathen monarch,\r\nsince the time of the Zulu King Chaka, ever illused a tributary people.\r\nFor the greater part of our period of suffering the Empire was engaged\r\nin a titanic struggle, which, for ghastliness is without precedent.\r\nI can think of no people in the Eastern Hemisphere who are absolutely\r\nunaffected by it; but the members of the Empire can find consolation\r\nin the fact that almost all creation is in sympathy with them.\r\nConstant disturbance has brought a realization to the entire universe\r\nthat nature, like the times, is out of joint.  The birds of the air\r\nand the fishes, like other denizens of the deep, are frequently drawn into\r\nthe whirlpool of misery; and a mutual suffering has identified them as it were\r\nwith some of the vicissitudes of an Empire at war.  And they too\r\nhave in their peculiar way felt impelled to offer their condolence\r\nto the dependants of those who have fallen in the combat on land, in the air,\r\non sea, and under the sea.  And while all creation stands aghast\r\nbeside the gaping graves, by rivers of blood, mourning with us\r\nthe loss of some of the greatest Englishmen that ever lived,\r\nSouth Africa, having constituted herself the only vandal State,\r\npossesses sufficient incompassion to celebrate the protection\r\nconferred on her by the British Fleet and devote her God-given security\r\nto an orgy of tyranny over those hapless coloured subjects of the King,\r\nwhom the Union constitution has placed in the hollow of her hands.\r\n\r\nIs there nobody left on earth who is just enough to call on South Africa\r\nto put an end to this cowardly abuse of power?\r\n\r\nWe appeal to the Colonists of Natal, who have declared themselves against\r\nthe persecution of their Natives; and would draw their attention to the fact\r\nthat in spite of their disapproval, expressed to the Lands Commission,\r\nthe Union Government, at the behest of a prisoner, is still tyrannizing\r\nover the Zulus.\r\n\r\nWe appeal to the Churches.  We would remind them that in the past\r\nthe Christian voice has been our only shield against\r\nlegislative excesses of the kind now in full swing in the Union.\r\nBut in the new ascendency of self and pelf over justice and tolerance,\r\nthat voice will be altogether ignored, unless strongly reinforced\r\nby the Christian world at large.  We appeal for deliverance\r\nfrom the operation of a cunningly conceived and a most draconian law\r\nwhose administration has been marked by the closing down\r\nof native Churches and Chapels in rural South Africa.\r\n\r\nWe appeal to the Jews, God's chosen people, who know\r\nwhat suffering means.  We would remind them that if after 1913\r\nthere was no repetition of a Russian pogrom it was largely because\r\nthe native leaders (including the author) have spared neither pains nor pence\r\nin visiting the scattered tribes and exhorting them to obey\r\nall the demands of the South African Government under the Grobler law\r\npending a peaceful intercession from the outside world.\r\nBut for this self-imposed duty on the part of the native leaders,\r\nI am satisfied that numbers of the native peasantry would have been mown down\r\nearly in 1914, and humanity would have been told that they were\r\njustly punished for disobedience to constituted authority.\r\n\r\nWe appeal to the leaders of the Empire -- that Empire for which\r\nmy own relatives have sacrificed life and property in order to aid\r\nits extension along the Cape to Cairo route, entirely out of love for\r\nher late Majesty Queen Victoria and with no expectation of material reward.\r\nWe ask these leaders to honour the plighted word of their noble predecessors\r\nwho collectively and severally assured us a future of peace and happiness\r\nas our membership privilege in the Empire for which we bled.\r\nThey were among the noblest Englishmen that ever left their native shores\r\nto create a prestige for their nation abroad.  They included\r\nheroes and empire-builders too many to mention, who all told us that they\r\nspoke in the name of Queen Victoria and on behalf of her heirs and successors.\r\nWhat has suddenly become of the Briton's word -- his bond -- that solemn\r\nobligations of such Imperialists should cease to count?  And if it is decided\r\nthat the Victorian Englishman and the Twentieth Century Englishman\r\nare creatures of different clay (and that with the latter honour is binding\r\nonly when both parties to the undertaking are white), surely this\r\ncould hardly be the moment to inaugurate a change the reaction of which\r\ncannot fail to desecrate the memories of your just and upright forebears.\r\n\r\nWe would draw the attention of the British people to the fact\r\nthat the most painful part of the present ordeal to the loyal black millions,\r\nwho are now doing all they can, or are allowed to do, to help the Empire\r\nto win the war, is that they suffer this consummate oppression\r\nat the bidding of a gentleman now serving his term for participating\r\nin a rebellion during this war.  We feel that it must be\r\na source of intense satisfaction to Mr. Piet Grobler in his cell,\r\nthat the most loyal section of the King's South African subjects\r\nare suffering persecution under his law -- a fact which, looked at\r\nfrom whatever standpoint, is equal to an official justification of the ideals\r\nfor which he rose in rebellion.  And if there is to be a return\r\nto the contented South Africa of other days, both the Natives' Land Act\r\n-- his law -- and the Report of the Lands Commission -- its climax --\r\nshould be torn up.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Courting Retribution\r\n\r\nFor three years and more the South African Government have persecuted\r\nmy kinsmen and kinswomen for no other crime than that they have meekly\r\npaid their taxes.  I had come to the conclusion, after meeting Colonials\r\nfrom all quarters of the globe and weighing the information\r\nobtained from them, that in no Colony are the native inhabitants\r\ntreated with greater injustice than in South Africa.*  Yet in spite of all\r\nI had seen and heard, I must say that, until this Report reached me,\r\nI never would have believed my white fellow-countrymen capable of conceiving\r\nthe all but diabolical schemes propounded between the covers\r\nof Volume I of the Report of the South African Lands Commission, 1916,\r\nand clothing them in such plausible form as to mislead\r\neven sincere and well-informed friends of the Natives.  There are\r\npages upon pages of columns of figures running into four, five or six noughts.\r\nThey will dazzle the eye until the reader imagines himself witnessing\r\nthe redistribution of the whole sub-continent and its transfer to\r\nthe native tribes.  But two things he will never find in that mass of figures;\r\nthese are (a) the grand total of the land so \"awarded\" to Natives;\r\nand (b) how much is left for other people.  To arrive at these he has to do\r\nhis own additions and subtractions, and call in the aid of statistics\r\nsuch as the Census figures, the annual blue books, etc., before the truth\r\nbegins to dawn on him.  They talk of having \"doubled\" the native areas.\r\nThey found us in occupation of 143,000,000 morgen and propose to squeeze us\r\ninto 18 million.  If this means doubling it, then our teachers\r\nmust have taught us the wrong arithmetic.  Is it any wonder\r\nthat it is becoming increasingly difficult for us to continue\r\nto love and respect the great white race as we truly loved it\r\nat the beginning of this century?\r\n\r\n--\r\n* Some white South Africans in recent years have migrated\r\n  to the Katanga region in the Belgian Congo.  I have read\r\n  in the South African daily papers, correspondence from some of them\r\n  complaining of their inability to make money.  They attributed\r\n  this difficulty to the fact that the Belgian officials will not permit them\r\n  to exploit the labour of the Congolese as freely as white men are accustomed\r\n  to make use of the Natives in British South Africa.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWe would submit a few problems in this Report for the British People\r\nand their Parliamentary Representatives to solve: --\r\n\r\nFirst:  Who are to become the occupants of the lands from which the Commission\r\nrecommends the removal of the native proletariat?\r\n\r\nSecondly:  In view of certain upheavals which we have seen not very long ago,\r\nand others which might take place in the future, it is pertinent to ask,\r\nconcerning the \"very small minority of the inhabitants\" -- the Whites --\r\nalluded to by Mr. Schreiner at the head of this chapter,\r\n(a) what proportion is in full sympathy with the ideals of the British Empire;\r\n(b) what proportion remains indifferent; and (c) what proportion\r\nmay be termed hostile?\r\n\r\nThirdly:  Does the autonomy granted to this \"small minority\"\r\namount to complete independence, or does it not?\r\n\r\nFourthly:  Would it not be advisable also to inquire:\r\nOf \"the vast majority of the inhabitants\" the King's Black subjects,\r\ndoomed by this Report to forfeit their homes and all they value\r\nin their own country, (a) how many of these are loyal,\r\nand (b) how many are not?\r\n\r\nFinally and solemnly we would put it to all concerned\r\nfor the honour and perpetuity of British dominion in South Africa,\r\ncan the Empire afford to tamper with and alienate their affections?\r\n\r\nAs stated already, this \"very vast majority of the inhabitants\"\r\nof South Africa has been strafed by the \"very small minority\"\r\nfor over three years.  And when the burden loaded on our bent backs\r\nbecomes absolutely unbearable we are at times inclined to blame ourselves;\r\nfor, when some of us fought hard -- and often against British diplomacy --\r\nto extend the sphere of British influence, it never occurred to us\r\nthat the spread of British dominion in South Africa would culminate\r\nin consigning us to our present intolerable position, namely, a helotage\r\nunder a Boer oligarchy.  But when an official Commission asks Parliament\r\nto herd us into concentration camps, with the additional recommendation\r\nthat besides breeding slaves for our masters, we should be made\r\nto pay for the upkeep of the camps:  in other words, that we\r\nshould turn the Colonials into slave raiders and slave-drivers\r\n(but save them the expense of buying the slaves), the only thing\r\nthat stands between us and despair is the thought that Heaven\r\nhas never yet failed us.  We remember how African women have at times\r\nshed tears under similar injustices; and how when they have been made\r\nto leave their fields with their hoes on their shoulders,\r\ntheir tears on evaporation have drawn fire and brimstone from the skies.\r\nBut such blind retribution has a way of punishing the innocent\r\nalike with the guilty, and it is in the interests of both\r\nthat we plead for some outside intervention to assist South Africa\r\nin recovering her lost senses.\r\n\r\nThe ready sympathy expressed by those British people\r\namong whom I have lived and laboured during the past two years\r\ninspires the confidence that a consensus of British opinion will,\r\nin the Union's interest, stay the hand of the South African Government,\r\nveto this iniquity and avert the Nemesis that would surely follow\r\nits perpetration.\r\n\r\nHer mind must have been riveted on South Africa when, quite recently,\r\nIda Luckie sang: --\r\n\r\n    Alas, My Country!  Thou wilt have no need\r\n    Of enemy to bring thee to thy doom. . . .\r\n    For not alone by war a nation falls.\r\n    Though she be fair, serene as radiant morn,\r\n    Though girt by seas, secure in armament,\r\n    Let her but spurn the vision of the Cross;\r\n    Tread with contemptuous feet on its command\r\n    Of mercy, Love and Human Brotherhood,\r\n    And she, some fateful day, shall have no need\r\n    Of enemy to bring her to the dust.\r\n\r\n    Some day, though distant it may be -- with God\r\n    A thousand years are but as yesterday --\r\n    The germs of hate, injustice, violence,\r\n    Like an insidious canker in the blood,\r\n    Shall eat that nation's vitals.  She shall see\r\n    Break forth the blood-red tide of anarchy,\r\n    Sweeping her plains, laying her cities low,\r\n    And bearing on its seething, crimson flood\r\n    The wreck of Government, of home, and all\r\n    The nation's pride, its splendour and its power.\r\n    On with relentless flow, into the seas\r\n    Of God's eternal vengeance wide and deep.\r\n    But, for God's grace!  Oh may it hold thee fast,\r\n    My Country, until justice shall prevail\r\n    O'er wrong and o'er oppression's cruel power,\r\n    And all that makes humanity to mourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[End of original text.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Original Advertisements.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Opinions of the Press on the First Edition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult to believe that such barbarities are possible;\r\nbut Mr. Plaatje gives chapter and verse for every one of his indictments;\r\nthe Act itself is quoted in extenso; various debates\r\nin the Colonial Parliament are given, and arguments for and against the Act\r\nfurnished by the different speakers.

He convincingly proves\r\nthat the fortunes of the native races should not have been\r\nhanded over to the Dutch Republicans without adequate safeguards.\r\nHe gratefully acknowledges the enthusiastic support given to the Natives\r\nby the British settlers and appeals for an inquiry.  The interest of the book\r\nfor the Punjabis consists, not in the similarity of the grievances,\r\nfor we here have no such grievance against the Government,\r\nbut in showing the way for inviting attention to the injustice involved\r\nin excluding a large class of Hindus from agriculture.\"\r\n-- `The Tribune', Lahore.\r\n\r\n\"It is a serious case, well and ably put, and the evidence embodied in it\r\nis very disquieting.
