Just how old he is I don’t know, but he’s pretty old;\r\nhis hands are gnarled and calloused and his finger nails chewed up and\r\nbroken by hammer blows; there are knotted veins in his forehead and his\r\nhair is grey and thin. But he works like a beaver, and don’t you ever\r\nhint that he should slow up--he will hoot at you, and say that he can\r\nlick any young feller with one hand. He will hitch his harness into\r\nplace--he has a rupture, and wears some kind of truss--and will slide\r\nunder the house to connect up a gas pipe, and come crawling out with\r\nhis hair and eyes full of cobwebs, and my wife will say, “Come out of\r\nthere, you old gopher.” He adores her when she talks to him like that,\r\nhe would lift the side of the house to please her. The two of them\r\nengage in violent arguments as to how a door ought to be hung or a tree\r\npruned. “Nobody ever did it like that,” Judd declares--and considers\r\nthat sufficient reason. He does it her way, so long as she stands over\r\nhim; but if she leaves, he is apt to finish it his way--for, after all,\r\nit is manifest that a man knows better than a woman.\r\n\r\nTen years ago our home was a row of vacant lots on a hillside, covered\r\nwith weeds and rusty cans. Now it is an old-fashioned Southern house\r\nwith a long veranda and a row of white columns, surrounded by rose\r\ngardens and grape arbors and fig trees and oranges. The house was made\r\nout of five old houses, bought for a little more than nothing, and\r\nmoved onto the place and joined together; the gardens were made by my\r\nwife sticking baby plants into the ground, and holding a hose over them\r\nall day and part of the night. I helped a little; and two school boys\r\nhelped after hours; but Judd was the Hercules who did most of this\r\nmighty labor. He would rout us out of bed in the morning, and many a\r\ntime we have worked after dark, to get a roof over something before\r\nit rained, or finish a concrete job before it set. What is there we\r\nhaven’t done together?--digging ditches and setting fence-posts, hoeing\r\nweeds and pruning trees, laying shingles and tacking down tarpaper,\r\ncleaning old furniture and painting an automobile, moving a garage\r\nand installing a sprinkler system. And always with a presiding female\r\ngenius hovering over us, exhorting and appraising, mostly on the debit\r\nside! Never was there such a woman for saving, and for devising, and\r\nfor utilizing. Once Judd in his digging came upon a rusty iron spike,\r\nand showed it secretly to me. “Better throw it over the hill quick,” he\r\nsaid. “If the missus sees that, she’ll start a railroad!”\r\n\r\nWhen the house was done, there was a party. The living room is\r\nextra fancy, with high, peaked ceiling, and lights way up, dim and\r\nmysterious; in a million years you’d never guess that it was once an\r\nold tailor shop, bought for a hundred dollars, and moved over here,\r\nand the upper floor taken out! Well, our friends came, some of them\r\nrich people in limousines, creating a sensation in our neighborhood.\r\nThe neighbors were invited--it is a working-class part of town, and\r\na few people came, shy and a little distrustful, and picked out\r\nseats with backs to the wall, and sat stiff and silent, while George\r\nSterling, great poet and genial soul, told us intimate recollections of\r\nJoachim Miller and Ambrose Bierce and Jack London, and other old-time\r\nCalifornia writers.\r\n\r\nJudd wore his best clothes, and a stiff collar, and brought a lady\r\nfriend in black satin. We were surprised by this, for we knew that Judd\r\nwas a widower of many years’ standing; we teased him afterwards about\r\nthis lady, and he blushed, but insisted there was “nothing to it”--and\r\napparently there wasn’t, for he still lives alone in the house he has\r\nbuilt, with a fire-place made of every kind of shiny colored stone you\r\ncan find on the beaches of California. There is a porch to this house\r\nand a lot of fancy concrete work, that will last Judd’s life-time and\r\nlonger. You must understand, this is no “hard-luck story,” quite the\r\ncontrary; Judd has got to be a rich man in the course of ten years,\r\nwith war-time wages of a dollar an hour. He put his savings into two\r\nlots, and his spare time into building three houses on them, and now\r\nhe has two of them rented, and he goes trout-fishing every spring, and\r\ndeer-hunting in the fall, and he took a trip to Texas just to have\r\nthe fun of spending some of his money, instead of leaving it all to\r\nhis nephews. When he comes now to do odd jobs for us, it is by way\r\nof a favor; and he says, “Well, you got a new book now?” Of course I\r\nalways have, and he demands a copy, and insists it must be cloth, and\r\nautographed; and then we have our regular argument as to whether he\r\nshall pay for it, and we compromise on the basis of his paying the\r\nwholesale price. He tells me what he thinks about my writings, and just\r\nwhat is wrong with my ideas.\r\n\r\nJudd, you understand, is not the least bit of a “radical.” “I got no\r\nuse for these ‘reds,’” he says, being a simon pure, hundred per cent\r\nAmerican; there are too many foreigners in the country, and if they\r\ndon’t like it, let them get out. But at the same time Judd is nobody’s\r\nfool. For one thing, he is “onto” the politicians; they are a bunch of\r\ncrooks, and he proves it, telling me things that are going on right in\r\nPasadena--he knows from this friend or that who works for the city.\r\nAlso, Judd is “onto” the politicians at Washington; of course you can’t\r\nget the facts, because the newspapers won’t print them, but look at\r\nthis oil business, and look at the fellows that got a billion dollars\r\nfrom the government, pretending to make airplanes for the war, and they\r\nnever got a single fighting-plane to France. Judd supported the war,\r\nand bought liberty bonds with his savings; but he says that if the\r\ntruth was known, we could have kept out of that war, if it hadn’t been\r\nfor the munition-makers, and the bankers and their loans to England and\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nSo you see, we have plenty to talk about while nailing down shingles\r\nand screwing up water-pipe! Once, not so long ago, Judd said to me,\r\n“By golly, I never thought of that!” I answered, “You’d be surprised\r\nto know how many things you never thought of.” Said he: “Why don’t\r\nyou write a book for fellows like me? A workingman is tired when he\r\ngets home, and don’t have time for big books, and he don’t know the\r\nlong words. But you write something short and easy, and show us little\r\nfellows just how we get it in the neck.”\r\n\r\nWell, there are lots of things one would like to write, and one doesn’t\r\nget around to them all. But every now and then I think about Judd, and\r\nthe millions of other Judds there are, scattered over this great land.\r\nI think of things I’d like to say to them, if only I could get to them.\r\nHere it is, Thanksgiving morning of the year 1925; and just why this\r\nmorning should have chosen itself, I can’t imagine, but I am sitting at\r\nmy typewriter, on the very porch that Judd helped to build, and came\r\ncrawling out from under with his hair and eyes full of cobwebs--the old\r\ngopher! I am beginning the book he asked me to write, for him and the\r\nother American workingmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nThere are some things which you and I and all Americans take for\r\ngranted, and don’t have to argue about. For example, every man has a\r\nright to get to heaven in his own way, if he can; we are not going to\r\nmeddle with any one’s religion. Also, we believe that all men should be\r\nequal before the law. We don’t mean they all have equal abilities--for\r\nthat would be a foolish thing to say; but they all have equal rights\r\n“to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” Also, every man has a\r\nright to what he has produced by his own labor; and it is the business\r\nof government to protect him in this right.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, we think that men live better if they are let\r\nalone, to work out their own destinies. We don’t want any more\r\ngovernment than there has to be; if the government will see that\r\nthe other fellow keeps his hands out of our pockets, we’ll manage\r\nto build our own house, and live in it our own way. That is called\r\nindividualism, and you are keen for it, Judd, and I am no less keen.\r\nThe only time the government has been on our place in the past ten\r\nyears has been when it came to inspect the foundations, the plumbing,\r\nand the fire-stops in the walls of the house; all of which concern the\r\ncommon welfare.\r\n\r\nIf a fellow won’t work, he has no right to anything--we agree to that,\r\nand we will shed no tears over shirkers and loafers. We are defending\r\nthe real workers, and we say that such are entitled to the fruits of\r\ntheir own labor. Let us set that down for the corner-stone of our\r\nthinking; let us make it our test of a sensible and decent world. I\r\nask you: Are the workers getting what they produce today? Or is some\r\nother fellow getting part of it? Put it the other way about, and ask:\r\nAre there any people in our country getting wealth without producing\r\nit, without doing any useful work? It is obvious that if any man gets a\r\nthing he hasn’t produced, some other man must have produced that thing\r\nand not got it.\r\n\r\nI choose a case which lies nearest to your own heart, Judd--those three\r\nhouses that are the security for your old age! You paid your good money\r\nfor materials, and you put them together with your own hands, and you\r\nsay those houses belong to you. If a fellow came with skids and a\r\ntruck and tried to cart one of them off, you would surely stop him. If\r\na fellow moved into one of them, and refused to move out, you would\r\nsurely put him out. The law would back you--and so you believe in the\r\nlaw! But suppose I were to tell you, Judd, there are ways by which some\r\nfellow might take your houses away from you, and the law would not move\r\na finger to help you, but on the contrary, would come and turn you out\r\nfor the other fellow’s benefit?\r\n\r\nWatch your step, now! Suppose that some man had the power to fix the\r\nprices of the things you have to buy day by day, your food and clothing\r\nand gasoline; and suppose he boosted the prices, so that you found\r\nyourself running short; then you’d have to put a mortgage on one of\r\nthe houses; and when the mortgage fell due, if you were still short,\r\nyour house would be sold by an auctioneer at a foreclosure sale, and\r\nthe law would turn you out. Or let us suppose this man had the power\r\nto dilute the currency of the country, so that every dollar of yours\r\nbecame worth only half as much as it was before; don’t you see that he\r\nmight deprive you of your three houses, one after another? There are a\r\ndozen different ways in which the trick might be worked; and strange\r\nand startling as the idea may seem to you, I assure you that it has\r\nbeen done many times, and will be done many times more. The world you\r\nlive in is full of devices by which your pockets are emptied, without\r\nyour ever feeling the touch of the thief’s fingers.\r\n\r\nIf a fellow comes along and tries to sell you a gold brick, you laugh\r\nat him; that’s an old one, and you are “on.” If he tries to sell you\r\na gold mine in Kamchatka, or shares of stock in an oil well--come to\r\nthink of it, Judd, I believe you told me you did take some shares in\r\nthe Somebody-or-Other Oil Syndicate--twelve hundred dollars, you said\r\nit was! But you’ve learned your lesson now, and nobody can play you for\r\na sucker again.\r\n\r\nBut, Judd, these things I am talking about here are not called\r\nswindling, they are entirely respectable things, with such beautiful\r\nnames that you go to the polls and vote for them on election day, and\r\nfor some of them you would give your life on the battlefield. For\r\nexample, that thing called the “protective tariff”; such a lovely\r\nname, “protective,” it makes you think of a mother watching over an\r\ninfant in a cradle! The economists call this tariff a form of “indirect\r\ntaxation”; and what do these words mean? Exactly that thing which I\r\nsaid a minute ago--a device for emptying your pockets without your\r\nfeeling the touch of the thief’s fingers!\r\n\r\nOr take that thing called “inflation”; that is, the diluting of the\r\ncurrency, so that the money in your pocket is less money than it was\r\nbefore. The bankers all tell you that “inflation” is a most wicked\r\nthing, and you believe them, and are quite sure it couldn’t happen;\r\nwhile the plain fact is, the bankers have been doing it to you right\r\nalong! They have deprived your money of about forty per cent of its\r\nvalue in the last ten years--and you, my good old friend, thought it\r\nwas fine, because the value of your lots went up, and of your houses,\r\ntoo. It never occurred to you that the price of everything you bought\r\nwas going up also; and that the value of your money in the savings-bank\r\nwas going _down_; and also the value of your liberty bonds!\r\n\r\nJudd, you get up by an alarm clock at dawn every morning, and boil\r\nyourself some coffee, and gulp down a couple of slices of bread, and\r\nmaybe a fried egg, and give your chickens and rabbits their water and\r\nfeed, and then you hustle off to work. For forty years that has been\r\nyour rule, six days out of seven; you worked like an old mule, eight\r\nor nine hours of it, and then come home and worked till dark on your\r\nown place. There are forty-two million Americans doing much the same\r\nthing, and the total of what they produce is a thumping pile of wealth.\r\nAnd who is to get it, Judd? How shall it be divided? In the great\r\ncities, in many-storied office buildings, sit white-handed gentlemen at\r\nflat-topped mahogany desks, and these gentlemen have no idea of ever\r\ncrawling around in the muck, or sweating in the heat, or freezing their\r\nfingers in the cold, or soiling their white collars and breaking the\r\ncrease in their trousers--no, Judd, they have not an idea of it!\r\n\r\nWhile you are working, these gentlemen have nothing to do but think;\r\nand the subject of their thoughts is one thing and one alone, how\r\ncan they get away from you the largest possible share of that\r\nwealth which you are producing by your labor. They call themselves\r\n“great executives,” Judd; and what they execute is the American\r\nworkingman. They have devised the most subtle and perfect machine of\r\nexploitation--that is, for getting you to produce wealth while they\r\nconsume it--which has ever existed in the history of mankind. I am\r\ngoing to show that machine to you; I am going to take it apart, just\r\nas if it were an automobile, and let you see exactly how it is built.\r\nI will show you the thing called “stock-watering,” and how it takes\r\naway from you the greater part of your day-by-day earnings. I will show\r\nyou the thing called “rigging the market,” and how that conjures the\r\ncoins out of your purse--and mind you, old friend, not when you go to\r\ngamble in Wall Street, for you have never done that; but when you go\r\nround the corner to the store and buy a loaf that is made of wheat, or\r\na shirt that is made of cotton, or any other article that is produced\r\nby machinery and shipped on a railroad.\r\n\r\nAbove all I am going to show you that most fascinating piece of\r\nwizardry, our banking system. You were a rancher in your youth; and\r\nsome of your relatives are farmers back East. Well, Judd, we have a\r\nthing called the Federal Reserve Bank, and three years ago that bank\r\nreached down into the pockets of the farmers of America, and took\r\nout--how much, do you think? Just about four billions of dollars! And\r\ngave it to whom, do you think? Why, to the big bankers of Wall Street,\r\nand the manufacturers and trust magnates with whom they work hand in\r\nglove. Soon after that I traveled through the Northwest, and in state\r\nafter state I found whole counties in which every single farm had been\r\nsold for taxes. Do you think I am claiming too much, Judd, when I tell\r\nyou that you really ought to understand how such things can happen?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nThe Bible tells us that “man does not live by bread alone.” To hear\r\nsome people talk, you would think the Bible said that “man does not\r\nlive by bread.” You and I know that he does; and if he is to be\r\ndecent and civilized, he needs many other things, a home with several\r\nrooms in it, and clean clothing, and books, and recreation. There is\r\nnothing more destructive of health and happiness than extreme poverty;\r\nthe inability to get for yourself and your loved ones the common\r\nnecessities of life.\r\n\r\nThere are parts of the world where poverty is an infliction of nature;\r\nbut that is surely not true of the United States in the year 1925.\r\nWe have a country of nearly four million square miles, with greater\r\nvariety and wealth of natural resources than any similar area in the\r\nworld. We have almost everything needed by modern industry; the bulk\r\nof our imports are luxuries--coffee and bananas and music and French\r\nfashions. We have forty-two millions of workers, all carefully trained\r\nto their jobs, and we have the most highly organized industrial system.\r\nWe produce 40 per cent of the world’s iron and steel, 52 per cent of\r\nits coal, 60 per cent of its copper, 75 per cent of its corn, 85 per\r\ncent of its automobiles, and so on through a long list.\r\n\r\nTwenty-seven years ago our government made a study of hand-power as\r\ncompared with machine-power in some of the common industries; thus,\r\nmaking ten plows by hand took 1,180 hours, while making them by\r\nmachinery took only 37½ hours; making one hundred pairs of cheap boots\r\ntook by hand 1,436 hours, and by machinery only 154 hours. From these\r\ncalculations it appeared that machinery had cut human labor, in some\r\ncases 80 per cent, in some cases as high as 95 per cent. That was in\r\n1898; and since then, how much more has been done! We have the Ford\r\nfactory, employing 165,000 men, and turning out 2,500,000 cars and\r\ntrucks every year, one for twenty days’ labor of a man! In Chicago\r\nare great ovens, worked automatically by electricity, which turn out\r\n14,400 perfect loaves of bread every day. I have a friend who owns\r\na book-making machine which turns out 64-page books at the rate of\r\n5,000 every hour. One might fill pages with miracles of this sort. We\r\nare now harnessing the rivers and water-falls, and in Maine the tides\r\nof the ocean, and engineers estimate that machine-power provides us\r\nwith the equivalent of three billion hard-working slaves. Mr. Roger\r\nW. Babson, who runs a big statistical bureau, presents figures of\r\nmachine-production from which it appears that 13 important industries\r\nnow average 88 times as much production as by hand-labor.\r\n\r\nObviously, then, everybody in the country ought to be 88 times as well\r\noff; poverty for the willing worker ought to be one-eighty-eighth of\r\nwhat it was in 1825. But what is the matter, Judd? For some reason\r\nthere is just as much poverty as there ever was, and possibly more!\r\nIn the old days nobody starved--that is, unless he was a loafer or a\r\ndrunkard. Our ancestors were well fed, and managed to raise families of\r\nten, and sometimes even twenty sturdy children. How many of the workers\r\nin our mills and mines can afford such a luxury today?\r\n\r\nI have before me a photograph of our national capital at Washington,\r\nwith its high white marble dome; the picture is taken over the top of\r\nfilthy slum tenements, falling into decay. And this is not a made-up\r\npicture, it is a photograph that you might take from many different\r\nspots in Washington. Or go to New York, the centre of our wealth and\r\nfashion; the school authorities there report that two-thirds of the\r\nchildren are physically defective, and one-fourth come to school\r\nsuffering from hunger and malnutrition; two years ago the State\r\nPlanning Commission reported two-thirds of a million people in the city\r\n“miserably housed.”\r\n\r\nIn New England are thousands of mill-workers now on strike against\r\nreduction in their starvation wages; here you find the “she-towns”--all\r\nthe men have gone away, and you can buy a woman for the price of a\r\nsandwich. In Pennsylvania a hundred thousand miners are on strike to\r\npreserve their wretched livings; they dwell in hovels, and can barely\r\nkeep their families. In Georgia and the Carolinas you find the mills\r\nrun on the labor of little children; and nearby are palatial estates of\r\nthe rich, a happy condition described by a woman poet:\r\n\r\n\r\n     The golf-links lie so near the mill\r\n       That almost every day\r\n     The laboring children can look out\r\n       And see the men at play.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe defenders of our industrial system will admit these facts, if you\r\npin them down, but they say that things are getting better all the\r\ntime. A professor of Harvard University has just published a book, in\r\nwhich he tells how our glorious system is rapidly solving all problems;\r\nvery certainly and very soon there will be no poor. Well, now, I am\r\ngoing to make a statement, Judd, and you paste it in your hat, and look\r\nat it every now and then while you are sawing timbers or mixing cement:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The condition of the mass of workers in the United States has\r\n     been getting slowly but steadily worse for the past thirty-five\r\n     years._\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us see now. We want to determine what are called “real wages”: that\r\nis to say, wages in relation to the cost of living. It is clear enough\r\nthat if your wages rise from four dollars a day to eight, and at the\r\nsame time the cost of living doubles, you are no richer than you were\r\nbefore. That is one way to fool the workingman; but we are not going to\r\nlet ourselves be fooled!\r\n\r\nThe problem is not a simple one; you have to figure wage-rates in\r\nrepresentative industries over a term of years; and then you have to\r\nfigure the average cost of goods for the same period of time. It is\r\neasy to “load” your figures, by giving emphasis to those trades in\r\nwhich wages rose, or, on the other hand, by featuring those goods whose\r\nprices stayed low. For example, as I write, Secretary Hoover reports\r\nto the President, and the President gives out to the press, a set of\r\nfigures showing how the American workers have made some gains in real\r\nwages during the last few years; and these glad tidings are featured\r\nupon the front page of all our great newspapers. And what is it? Simply\r\na barefaced fraud! Mr. Hoover has figured wholesale prices! He knows\r\nthat these prices have gone down, while retail prices have not gone\r\ndown correspondingly; also, needless to say, he knows that American\r\nworkingmen do not buy their food and clothing at wholesale!\r\n\r\nProf. Paul H. Douglas of the University of Chicago published in the\r\nProceedings of the Academy of Political Science (Vol. XI, No. 2), a\r\nvery elaborate study of real wages from 1890 to 1924. This is the best\r\nwork I had seen, and the results may be summed up in one sentence: real\r\nwages in the United States from 1890 to 1924 suffered a _decrease_ of\r\nfive per cent. To phrase it another way: where a workingman could buy\r\n20 pounds of necessaries in 1890, he could buy 19 pounds today.\r\n\r\nThese figures caused a sensation; for you can understand that there is\r\nnothing our masters try so hard to keep from their servants as this\r\nvery fact. I used the figures throughout these letters; but just as\r\nI am through, and about to send the manuscript to the printer, the\r\nprofessor writes me a letter, saying that he has revised the work,\r\nand he now shows a gain in real wages during the past four years. The\r\nreason for the change is, he has decided that the earlier figures were\r\n“unduly weighted with pork and beef, which rose much more rapidly than\r\nother commodities.”\r\n\r\nHere you see the very thing I explained. How much pork and beef shall\r\nbe figured in the family budget of a workingman? Our fathers ate pork\r\nand beef, and grew to be full sized men; but of course there was no\r\nbeef trust in those days. If, now, the cost of pork and beef rise too\r\nfast, the workingman can adjust himself to a coolie diet, those starchy\r\nfoods which are cheap and relatively stable in price. But I, for my\r\npart, eat pork or beef once a day, and I claim the same right for you,\r\nJudd!\r\n\r\nThis much is certain: in many basic industries there has been a loss.\r\nThe new figures which the professor sends me show losses for the\r\nclerical workers and the postal clerks; and the only large gainers\r\nare the teachers, who regard themselves as professional persons, not\r\nas workingmen. Surely those striking textile workers in Massachusetts\r\nhave made no gains this year, nor the 158,000 striking miners! Ask the\r\nfarmers of the Northwest about their case, and you will hear a loud\r\nshout of denial! Ex-governor Lowden of Illinois stated at a public\r\nbanquet in New York that from 1920 to 1924 the American farmer’s return\r\non his invested capital was three-tenths of one per cent!\r\n\r\nI know there is a great deal of apparent prosperity among our workers\r\ntoday. But that is due to a new factor--that the worker now spends his\r\nmoney for things that last, a home, and an auto, and clothing and radio\r\nsets, instead of spending it for beer and whiskey. That is a vast gain\r\nin civilization, but it is not the same thing as a gain in real wages,\r\nand don’t let anybody fool you by this argument.\r\n\r\nTo get a clear view of the real truth, ask this question: has the\r\ncapitalist suffered a loss of purchasing power during the past\r\nthirty-five years? Merely to suggest such a thing is to raise a laugh!\r\nThere are some, like Henry Ford, who are a million times richer\r\ntoday than they were thirty-five years ago. It is probable that the\r\nRockefellers are twenty times as rich as in 1890. The total wealth of\r\nour country increased from 65 billions in 1890 to 320 billions in 1922;\r\nand as the workers didn’t get the difference, the rich must have. Here\r\nis what they admit having got, in their income tax statements, during\r\nfour years 1921-1924. The number of fortunate ones who got more than\r\n$300,000 a year income increased from 246 to 773. The number of those\r\nwith incomes between $100,000 and $300,000 increased from 2,106 to\r\n4,921. The number with incomes between $25,000 and $100,000 increased\r\nfrom 37,663 to 62,158. Those are the real insiders--and remember, Judd,\r\nthey didn’t have to admit any “stock dividends,” nor to pay anything on\r\nthe billion or two they have invested in tax exempt securities.\r\n\r\nThere is a statement commonly made by Socialists, justifying their\r\nprophecy that our present system is on the way to a breakdown. The\r\nstatement is that the rich are growing richer and the poor growing\r\npoorer. I know of no statement which causes more irritation to the\r\ncapitalist press; I suppose I have read a thousand editorials in which\r\nthe statement is ridiculed, or denounced, or waved aside as out-of-date\r\nand not applying to America. Nevertheless, it is the truth, Judd; all\r\nthe workers are growing relatively poorer, and vast groups of them are\r\ngrowing absolutely poorer, in the terms of what they can buy with their\r\nwages. And this in the headquarters of prosperity, the richest of all\r\nnations, which houses in its treasure-vaults more than half the total\r\ngold-reserves of the world!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nHow does it happen that, in this our land of liberty and prosperity,\r\nthe rich are growing richer and the poor poorer.\r\n\r\nWhen you talk about the matter with an economist, he uses many long\r\nwords, and tells you about natural processes, controlled by inexorable\r\nlaws. Well, Judd, it all depends upon how you look at it, from the\r\ninside or the outside. If you look from the outside, you see economic\r\nprocesses; but if you look from the inside, you see the actions of men.\r\nWealth is produced by the actions of men--you know that, because you do\r\nit every day; and wealth is distributed by the actions of men--you also\r\ndo that every day. If men, in the course of their dealings, have made\r\na hell on earth, it has been because they first had a hell in their\r\nhearts; and if they are to make a paradise on earth, they first have to\r\nchange their hearts, and then no economic laws will stand in their way.\r\n\r\nFirst among the “actions of men” which have made poverty in America,\r\nI list our banking system: that is to say, the way men have behaved\r\nand are behaving with regard to money. This banking system has been\r\nconstructed, just as artificially as a house is constructed, and its\r\nplan can be summed up in one phrase: to enable those who already have\r\nmoney to get as much more as possible. Many things about the system may\r\nseem complicated, but if you understand that basic idea, you will never\r\nbe fooled.\r\n\r\nOne man raises grain, and another saws lumber. It would be awkward to\r\nexchange a stick of timber for so many bushels of wheat, therefore men\r\nhave invented money, which is a standard of value, enabling anything\r\nto be exchanged for anything else. The first point to be got clear is\r\nthat money is not wealth, but only a symbol of wealth. You can see that\r\nclearly, if you imagine yourself stranded on a barren island with a\r\nmillion dollars in greenbacks. Would you be rich? You would not! And it\r\nis equally plain that nobody is made richer when the government prints\r\na new lot of bank-notes. Of course, if you printed the notes yourself,\r\nand put them into circulation, you would be richer; but this wealth\r\nwould be got by taking away from the owners of real wealth a certain\r\npercentage of what they owned; there would be a little more money in\r\ncirculation, and so the existing stock of goods would have a slightly\r\nhigher money-value.\r\n\r\nThat is what I refer to as “diluting the currency.” When it is done by\r\ngovernments, it is known as “inflation,” and it is a favorite trick of\r\ngovernments in trouble. They print paper money, and spend it for goods,\r\nand the more they print, the less is the value of each unit of money,\r\nthe rouble, the mark, the franc, or whatever it is called. The bankers,\r\nof course, are greatly opposed to this method of robbing the owners of\r\nwealth; their objection to the process being based upon the fact that\r\nwhen the paper money is printed, the government owns it, whereas the\r\nbankers think that they, the bankers, should own it. In this country\r\nthey have been able to have their way, and we live under a system which\r\nestablishes the bankers as legalized counterfeiters.\r\n\r\nYou must understand, Judd, that only about one per cent of modern\r\nbusiness is done upon a basis of cash--gold or silver or greenbacks;\r\nthe rest is notes, or bills of exchange, or checks, or some other\r\nform of credit. And the banker is the man who creates this credit. He\r\nsells it to you, for whatever price he sees fit; and it is his royal\r\nprivilege to grant or to withhold it. You may have ever so much real\r\nwealth to offer for security, and still meet with refusal; or you may\r\nhave merely a pretense of security, and carry off the prize because you\r\nare the nephew of a director. The banker gives you a “pass-book” with\r\na line of figures written in it, and you go out into the market, and\r\ndiscover that your banker-made money is just as real as any other money\r\nyou find there--as real as the corn the farmer has raised, or the house\r\nthe carpenter has built.\r\n\r\nThe theory is that the banker is lending the money which his\r\nbank-customers have deposited with him. But see! You take $350 in\r\ngreenbacks and put it in the bank, and under our banking laws the\r\nbanker can deposit those greenbacks with the Federal Reserve Bank, and\r\nreceive a credit of $1,000; and then on the basis of that $1,000 he is\r\nlegally permitted to lend out sums amounting to about $10,000 to other\r\ncustomers of the bank. In other words, $350 deposited by a customer\r\nbecomes the basis of bank-loans, not merely of that $350, but of $9,650\r\nadditional, created by our legalized counterfeiter! The outstanding\r\namount of greenbacks, about a third of billion dollars, thus becomes\r\nthe basis of ten billions of dollars of banker-created money--and this\r\nfor the national banks alone, without counting all the state banks and\r\nthe private banks!\r\n\r\nThe headquarters of this greatest graft of all the ages is Wall Street.\r\nThe money from all the little banks pours in here, and likewise\r\nthe insurance money which our people put up to insure the safety\r\nof their wives and children. It is all at the service of the big\r\nbanker-speculators, to be used in manipulating markets, driving prices\r\nup and down, so that the insiders can buy while securities are low and\r\nsell while they are high. Here is concentrated the collective greed of\r\nall America, and men become frenzied with visions of sudden gain; they\r\nsell the goods they hope to have, and buy with the profits they expect\r\nto make, and the fires of avarice are fanned white hot, until the whole\r\nthing bursts like a crucible in a steel mill.\r\n\r\nThe financial history of America is the record of a series of great\r\npanics, coming at intervals of from seven to ten years. In these crises\r\nthe bankers used to suffer as well as the rest of us; but this was\r\nintolerable to them, and so they put their experts to work. To save\r\nyourself in a panic you must have money--a great deal of money in a\r\nhurry; and where can such money be got? Where, but from our good old\r\nUncle Sam? So the bankers devised a wonderful new scheme, the Federal\r\nReserve System; a chain of twelve regional banks with a directing head,\r\na banker-board, having for its function to watch over our money system\r\nin the interest of the bankers, to lend money freely when they want it\r\nto be cheap, and to call in loans when they are ready for a killing;\r\nabove everything else, to watch out for panics, and when these come, to\r\nissue credit to the big insiders, so that they can keep afloat while\r\nthe rest of us drown.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1920, there was a riot of speculation, and this\r\nbankers’ board decided that somebody had to be “deflated”; they\r\npicked out the farmers--who cares anything about the “hicks” out\r\nin the sticks? “Go home and slop the hogs,” was the word of a\r\nbanker-legislator in North Dakota to a delegation of farmers. So the\r\nFederal Reserve Board “advised” the farmer banks to lend no more\r\nmoney to farmers; and one little hint was enough to bring farm prices\r\ncrashing. Before the crisis was over, a total of 603,000 farmers had\r\neither lost their farms, or were keeping them on sufferance of their\r\ncreditors; and those are government figures, Judd! You know how it was\r\nwith produce that year--the farmers in the middle West burned their\r\ncorn for fuel, and out here in Southern California it didn’t pay to\r\ngather the orange and lemon crops. But the prices of automobiles and\r\nhardware and lumber and cement did not share this harsh fate; the big\r\nWall Street banks had all the credit they needed, and they “carried”\r\ntheir friends, the big manufacturers, whose stocks and bonds repose in\r\ntheir vaults. They were “sitting pretty,” and waited till the storm was\r\nover, and we were ready to buy their goods at the old fancy prices.\r\n\r\nSo you see what I mean, Judd, by my phrase, “legalized counterfeiters.”\r\nThe power to issue new credit is the power to dilute the currency, and\r\nmerely by the stroke of your pen. All the highwaymen and safe-breakers\r\nand world conquerors of history never carried off as much treasure\r\nas Wall Street has taken from the American people by the use of this\r\npower. In that summer of 1920, the Federal Reserve System took _four\r\nbillion dollars_ out of the pockets of our farmers! And now, Judd, I\r\nbeg you, when next you hear people say that human ingenuity cannot\r\ncure poverty--_remember how much human ingenuity has done to cause it!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nWe are studying our money system, with the idea of understanding how it\r\ncauses the rich to grow richer and the poor poorer.\r\n\r\nMoney, in its relation to the price of goods, is like a pair of scales\r\nin balance. If you add to the weight in the right-hand pan, it will go\r\ndown; also, the same thing will happen if you take away the weight in\r\nthe other pan. A bushel of wheat is worth, let us say, one dollar; and\r\nif anything should happen to double the quantity of wheat in the world,\r\nthe price of wheat would go to half a dollar. On the other hand suppose\r\nthat without changing the amount of wheat in the world, you were to cut\r\nin half the amount of money in the world; then the same thing would\r\nhappen, the cost of a bushel of wheat would go to half a dollar. By\r\nreducing the money supply, you lower prices, and make “tight” money; by\r\nincreasing the money supply, you raise prices, and make “soft” money.\r\n\r\nNow, the people of our country are divided into two classes, those who\r\nown money, and those who owe it; the creditor class and the debtor\r\nclass. It is evident that there is a conflict of interest between these\r\ntwo classes, as to how much money shall be put into circulation. If\r\nthe money supply is increased, money is cheaper, and wages go up, so\r\nit is easier to get money and pay your debts. But the creditor loses\r\ncorrespondingly, because he cannot buy so much goods with the money\r\nhe gets; thus, for the government to put more money into circulation,\r\nis to cancel a percentage of all debts. But on the other hand, if the\r\namount of money in circulation should be reduced, money will be harder\r\nto get, and it will buy more goods; thus all creditors will be getting\r\nmore than is really due them, and a great many debtors will be ruined,\r\nbecause they cannot pay this extra amount.\r\n\r\nAll through our history there has been a struggle between these two\r\nclasses. Whichever side controls the government, will shift the\r\ncurrency supply to favor itself. And which side has controlled? The\r\nanswer is, the rich; they have had the money to subsidize political\r\nparties and name candidates and carry elections. Here is a rule of\r\npolitics, Judd, which I set down for you to paste in your hat and study\r\nwhile you are sawing timbers and mixing cement:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Out of fifteen presidential elections since the civil war,\r\n     fourteen were carried by that party which had the biggest campaign\r\n     fund._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe struggle has centered about what is called the “gold standard.”\r\nAll money of our government is supposed to be exchangeable for gold.\r\nPrior to 1873, silver also counted as a standard; but in that year\r\nsilver was “demonetized,” and of course that made money very “tight.”\r\nThe “Crime of ’73,” this action of the creditor class was called; it\r\nproduced a frightful panic, and tens of thousands of men were ruined,\r\nand hundreds driven to suicide. Since poverty breeds poverty, the great\r\nmass of the descendants of these people are still poor, and are told in\r\nthe churches that it is the Will of God, and in the newspapers that it\r\nis Economic Law.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 we had another severe panic; I was a boy then, and remember\r\nit well. Millions of men were out of work and starving, and the mass\r\nof discontent piled up, and three years later we had the Bryan “free\r\nsilver” campaign. I was just beginning to think about politics, and\r\nif today I can be patient with the mass of our deluded workingmen\r\nand farmers, voting for “Coolidge and Prosperity,” it is because I\r\nrecollect exactly how I was bamboozled in 1896, so that I would have\r\nvoted for “McKinley and Prosperity,” had I been of age. Mark Hanna, the\r\nmillionaire corruptionist and banker-boss who paid McKinley’s personal\r\ndebts and set him up for our puppet-president, raised a campaign fund\r\nof $16,750,000, and bought that election for his puppet, quite openly\r\nand obviously; so Bryan, who had only $675,000 for his campaign fund,\r\ndid not succeed in his scheme of making silver money, and letting all\r\nthe business men off with half payments to the bankers. So here again\r\nyou see how the “actions of men” kept the rich rich and the poor poor;\r\nand God had nothing to do with it--unless you believe that God was\r\nbuying votes for Mark Hanna!\r\n\r\nThe maintaining of the “gold standard” as in 1896 would by now have put\r\nthe bankers in possession of the entire wealth of our country; and that\r\nwas what the bankers intended. But an accident happened--the discovery\r\nof new gold, and the development of large-scale, commercial mining of\r\nlow-grade ore. So we got the very thing Bryan had wanted--more money in\r\ncirculation; and so the bankers have got only one third of our wealth,\r\nand a mortgage on another third. Also, they have their Federal Reserve\r\nSystem, whereby they manipulate the currency; they can make “free\r\nsilver” today, and “gold standard” tomorrow, and when the next smash-up\r\ncomes, they will sweep the board clean.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Judd, the “gold standard” has been nothing but a\r\npious memory since the World War; the gambling game has run away with\r\nthe players, and no sensible man believes that the world’s debts can\r\never be paid, in gold or in anything else. Our Federal Reserve notes,\r\nwhich make up most of our paper money, no longer carry the promise to\r\npay in gold, or in anything--look at one and see. There are “silver\r\ncertificates,” that promise you a silver dollar, but the others\r\npromise nothing. One sort of “paper” is pyramided on another sort of\r\n“paper”--stocks and bonds and promissory notes and bills of exchange\r\nand certificates of deposit and personal checks, all take the place of\r\ncurrency, and become the basis of new loans and credits and promises\r\nto pay at some future date. The outstanding greenbacks, about a third\r\nof a billion dollars, become the basis of ten billion dollars of\r\nimaginary money; and there are over three billions of Federal Reserve\r\nnotes outstanding, and nearly a billion of national banknotes, all\r\nsecured by nothing but paper; and there are 25 billions of government\r\nbonds, to say nothing of all state and county and municipal bonds, and\r\nsome 19 billions owed to us by foreign nations, all of which paper the\r\nbanks have put off on us; and we are adding to the foreign credit a\r\nbillion a year, for the reason that we cannot keep our industries going\r\notherwise. Moreover, we have worked out a system of selling automobiles\r\nand houses and furniture on instalment payments, and there are six or\r\nseven billions of such credits now outstanding, all backed by the banks.\r\n\r\nSuch is our “banking system,” Judd; and at every step of every process\r\nyou find the banker paying low interest rates for what he borrows, and\r\ncollecting high rates for what he lends; at every stage the government\r\nbelongs to the banker, not merely to collect his money for him, but\r\nto fix the rates against you, and even against itself. Thus, after\r\ngenerations of agitation, we succeeded in getting postal savings banks,\r\nto protect the money of the very poor; the government pays the poor at\r\nthe rate of 2% for this money--and accepts only $2,500, even at this\r\nlow rate! The rest of the money it needs, the government borrows from\r\nthe bankers at from 3½% to 5¼%! For those Federal Reserve notes which\r\nthe government allows the big bankers to lend out to you, the banks pay\r\nthe government about 2½%; and what do they charge for the money they\r\nlend to you? Well, I am paying seven, and have sometimes paid eight;\r\nGod grant that you may never be really poor, Judd, and have to pay what\r\nthe poor devils pay! It happened a few years ago, by some freak of\r\nchance, that we got an honest Comptroller of the Currency--the official\r\nwho is supposed to control the banks; he found he couldn’t and they got\r\nrid of him in a hurry--but not before he issued a report, which would\r\nhave given you the facts, had not the newspapers suppressed it. He said:\r\n\r\n“Sworn reports, made by the banks themselves, show that on September\r\n2, 1915, 2,743 national banks, out of a total of 7,613, were guilty\r\nof usury. This at a time when the Federal Reserve banks were offering\r\nmoney freely to national banks in every part of the country at rates\r\nvarying from 3½ to 5%.”\r\n\r\nIn Oklahoma, where the legal rate of interest is 6% with 10% as the\r\nmaximum under special contract, harassed farmers paid all the way\r\nfrom 12 to 2400%, with 40% as the average. In the case of one bank,\r\nthe comptroller proved that not a single solitary loan had been made\r\nunder 15%. He cited one particular case that he asked to be regarded\r\nas typical. In the spring the farmer went to the bank and arranged\r\nfor a loan of $200. Out of his necessity he was compelled to pay 55%\r\ninterest charge. Unable to meet the note at maturity, he had to agree\r\nto 100% interest in order to get the renewal. The next renewal forced\r\nhim up to 125%. For four years the thing went on, and all the drudgery\r\nof the father and the mother and the six children could never keep down\r\nthe terrible interest or wipe out the principal. As a finish, the bank\r\nswooped down and sold him out; the wretched man, barefoot and hungry,\r\nwent to work clearing a swamp, caught pneumonia and died; the county\r\nburied him, and neighbors raised a purse to send the widow and children\r\nback to friends in Arkansas.\r\n\r\nAnd what do the banks make out of such exploitation? Well, take one\r\ncase; the great First National Bank of New York earned 140% on its\r\ncapital in 1925; its stock has gone up to $2950 for a share having a\r\npar value of $100. According to the “Financial Age,” a Wall Street\r\npaper, 49 New York banks averaged 50% dividends in 1925.\r\n\r\nAll right, Judd; and now here are three sentences for you to paste in\r\nyour hat and learn by heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n     FIRST: _Credit is the life blood of industry, and the control of\r\n     credit is the control of all society._\r\n\r\n     SECOND: _The private control of credit is the modern form of\r\n     slavery._\r\n\r\n     AND THIRD: _The American banking system is the most perfect\r\n     contrivance yet devised by the human brain for making the rich\r\n     richer and the poor poorer._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nThe next thing we want to understand is the tariff, and how that works\r\nto take money out of the pockets of the poor and put it into the\r\npockets of the rich.\r\n\r\nThe government has to have money, like any other business. We all\r\ndesire government services, and should pay our proper share, honestly\r\nand openly calculated. But we haven’t an honest government, nor an\r\nhonest social system; nobody wants to pay his share of anything, and\r\ntaxes are unpopular; therefore the politicians put their wits to work\r\nand devise what are called “indirect taxes,” ways of getting your money\r\nwithout your knowing it. Among these ways is the “protective tariff.”\r\n\r\nThis was another great issue of the McKinley days, and well I remember\r\nthe campaign slogans, devised for tricking the poor voters! “Protection\r\nand Prosperity; the Full Dinner Pail; the Foreigner Pays the Tax!” We\r\nliked the last one especially; we hated the foreigner, and were strong\r\nfor making him pay--though just why we should have expected foreigners\r\nto put up the money to support the government of the United States, was\r\nsomething we might have been puzzled to explain!\r\n\r\nA tariff is a tax imposed on all goods brought into the country. A\r\nprotective tariff is a tax high enough to shut out foreign competition,\r\nby raising the cost of imported goods. Who pays the tax? The importer\r\npays it, and he at once adds it to the price of the goods, so that\r\nthe tax is passed on to the person who uses the goods, the ultimate\r\nconsumer. He is the man who pays, always and everywhere; and the effect\r\nof the tariff is simply to boost prices in a whole line of commodities.\r\nIf the government got all this boost, it wouldn’t be so bad; but the\r\ngovernment gets only a small fraction, and the rest is a fat and juicy\r\ngraft for the “protected” manufacturers.\r\n\r\nBut, say the newspapers and campaign orators of the “Grand Old Party,”\r\nit is the workingman as well as his boss who is “protected”; if it were\r\nnot for the tariff, our wage scales would be dragged down to the levels\r\nof Europe; the labor-sweating foreigner would “dump” his goods on us!\r\nWell, Judd, for the workingman to try to improve his condition by a\r\ntariff, is as if a man should make himself rich by taking money out of\r\nhis right-hand pocket and putting it into his left-hand pocket. If you\r\nlook only at the left side of this man, you will think he is enjoying\r\n“prosperity”; and that is what the newspapers and the campaign orators\r\ndid--and the poor workingman too, alas; for the subject is complicated,\r\nand the workingman does not have much time to think.\r\n\r\nBut you can see, Judd, that after the workingman has got his protected\r\njob and has collected his protected wages, he has to go to the stores\r\nand spend his money, and there he pays higher prices for everything\r\nhe buys, because all these things have been “protected” from foreign\r\ncompetition, and the manufacturers of the things have been able to form\r\ntrusts and fix the prices at higher levels. Just how much higher are\r\nthe levels? The answer is easy; they are always a little higher than\r\nthe wages! The whole story was told in the figures I gave you as to the\r\nmovement of real wages in our country. Following the example of the\r\n“Grand Old Party,” let me give you a slogan:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The protective tariff in the past thirty-five years has reduced\r\n     the real wages of the American workingman by five per cent!_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what about the farmer? The farmer does not get much protection on\r\nhis products, but has to buy vast quantities of manufactured goods at\r\n“protected” prices. Take the United States Census Reports, and study\r\nthe growth of farm mortgages from 1890 to 1920. This is the final test,\r\nyou understand; for the farmer does not give the banker a mortgage on\r\nhis land because he loves the banker, but solely and simply because the\r\ncost of running his farm is greater than the income derived from the\r\nfarm. We find that in 1890 there were mortgages on 27.8% of our farms,\r\nand in 1920 on 37.2%. So here is a slogan for the farmers:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The protective tariff has increased the enslavement of the\r\n     farmers to the bankers by thirty-three per cent in thirty years!_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what has been the effect of the protective tariff upon our\r\npolitics? That also is easy to answer: it has made them a football to\r\nbe kicked about by rival greedy interests; it has made our government\r\na fat oyster to be opened and eaten at the banquets of trust magnates.\r\nThe lobbyists of the big manufacturing interests have swarmed to\r\nWashington with their pockets full of bribes, and our congressmen and\r\nsenators have been hogs at a swill-trough. Our political conventions\r\nhave been bargain-counters, where candidates have met in secret\r\nhotel-rooms with the agents of the trusts, and have sold their honor\r\nand the welfare of the people. When the campaigns begin, the protected\r\ninterests are frightened into putting up huge sums--“frying out\r\nthe fat” is the phrase; and then we have red fire and torch-light\r\nprocessions and banners and a wild hurrah, and the voters are herded to\r\nthe polls like sheep--at the standard price of two dollars per sheep.\r\n\r\nI grant you, Judd, that it might have been a reasonable policy for\r\nthe American people to tax themselves to build up their industries at\r\nthe beginning, when the industries were young and needed help. But\r\nwhat are we to say when these carefully nourished “infant industries”\r\ngrow up into highwaymen that knock us on the head? It happened that in\r\n1917 our country went to war “to make the world safe for democracy”;\r\nand that was surely a time for patriotic sacrifices on the part of\r\nthese beneficiaries of protection! From a report of the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury I take a few figures concerning the profits they made in\r\nthat year. One woolen mill, hiding behind the carefully constructed\r\ntariff wall, made 1770% on its capital stock; and in case that Wall\r\nStreet method of figuring should puzzle you, Judd, I put it into\r\nyour kind of figures; you build a house for $1,000, and sell it for\r\n$18,700. Seventeen woolen mills reported profits of over 100% on\r\ntheir capital stock--that is, the stockholders got back in one year’s\r\nprofit the total amount of their investment. The great American Woolen\r\nCompany, with its capital stock of $60,000,000, made a net profit of\r\n$28,560,342. Canners of fruits and vegetables, tariff protected, made\r\nas high as 2032%. Clothing and dry goods stores, tariff protected,\r\nmade a profit of 9826%. One steel mill, tariff protected, made as high\r\nas 290,999%. This, you will say, must be a joke; but I am quoting the\r\nfigures of Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo: the capital stock of the\r\nconcern was $5,000, and the net profits were $14,549,952. The great\r\nsteel trust, our billion dollar infant, made in two years a net profit\r\nexceeding its capital stock.\r\n\r\nThese of course, are war-time profits; but I assure you, Judd, such\r\nthings are being done right along, up to this hour. Take our textile\r\nindustry, highly protected, and paying starvation wages to its horde\r\nof wretched slaves. The great Amoskeag Company, manufacturing many\r\nkinds of cotton goods, had in 1907 a capital of $4,000,000, which it\r\nhas increased to $44,500,000, all out of profits. Last year it made\r\na net profit of $2,851,131, which is 71% on the original investment.\r\nOr take the bread trust, which feeds--or feeds upon--the poor in our\r\nslum tenements. In 1922 the General Baking Company earned at the rate\r\nof 117% on each share of its original common stock. This stock rose\r\nfrom $2 in 1916 to $1,350 in 1925; and I assure you that is not a\r\nmisprint--it is exactly as written! In this morning’s paper I read how\r\nthe president of this company has just paid $200,000 for a box at the\r\nopera; the story tells how he rose from poverty, and we are expected to\r\nbe proud of him!\r\n\r\nSome understanding of the tariff robbery having begun to filter down to\r\nthe people, our political masters promised us a reform. There was to\r\nbe a “scientific” tariff; a commission was to study costs and prices,\r\nand provide exactly the right amount of protection. Well, last year\r\nthis commission turned in a report, most “scientific,” showing how the\r\nsugar trust was exploiting the American people and advising the cutting\r\nof their tariff favors. And what did President Coolidge do with the\r\nreport? He did his best to suppress the facts; and his action cost us a\r\ntotal of $53,000,000 in nine months!\r\n\r\nOr again, take aluminum, used in making our kitchen utensils. This\r\ntrust was organized in 1888, with a paid up capital of $20,000. Not\r\none dollar more of real money has ever been put into it; but it has a\r\ntariff protection of 7 cents a pound, and in 1923 the concern paid a\r\nprofit of 1000% on the original investment! The company’s circular now\r\nclaims assets of $110,000,000, and last year a report of the Federal\r\nTrade Commission declared the company a monopoly which “threatened\r\ncompetitors with extermination unless obedient to the company’s will.”\r\nThe United States Attorney-General declared, in February, 1925, that\r\nthis company had violated provisions of the dissolution decree and had\r\n“shown itself indifferent to the provisions of the decree.”\r\n\r\nAnd what did President Coolidge do about that? The answer is easy--he\r\nalways does the same thing, which is nothing. And why? The Aluminum\r\nCompany of America is another name for the Mellon family, and the\r\nhead of this family, the third richest man in America, is President\r\nCoolidge’s Secretary of the Treasury, the man who determines the\r\nfinancial policy of our country. Since he took his high office he\r\nhas had just one idea, which the entire propaganda department of Big\r\nBusiness has been hammering into the heads of our people--that the way\r\nto make prosperity for the poor is to reduce the taxes of the rich, so\r\nthat the rich will start plenty of industries and pay big wages to the\r\npoor. You may see exactly how it works, when you learn that this rich\r\nlaw-breaker who sits in our cabinet pays his aluminum workers a wage of\r\n$3.36 per day! Figure the income of such a worker, on the basis of six\r\ndays a week at full time, with no holidays whatever; and then consult\r\nlast year’s income tax returns, and see what income is acknowledged by\r\nthe Honorable Andrew W. Mellon; and so you get a perfect picture of the\r\nCoolidge idea of “prosperity.” It runs as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _For a wage-slave of the aluminum trust and his family, $88 a\r\n     month; for a law-defying, whiskey-distilling Pittsburgh banker\r\n     in the cabinet, $284,000 a month; and to help out the family,\r\n     $178,000 a month for his brother!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nFigure to yourself a man pumping water from the ground, filling a tank\r\nto supply his house. There is an abundance of water, and the pump is\r\nbig and powerful, and every time the man pushes the handle many gallons\r\ngo rushing towards the tank. The man works all day, yet when he goes\r\nto the house in the evening, he discovers there are only a few drops\r\nof water in his tank. Some men have tapped the pipe, all along the\r\nway, and have diverted the water to their own tanks; so the man has to\r\nsupply hundreds of gallons to others before he can get a few drops for\r\nhimself. Would you not say that it was worth while for that man to find\r\nout about those tap-lines; how much they take off, how they got to be\r\nthere, and by what right they remain?\r\n\r\nWell, Judd, that is the position of the American laborer and the\r\nAmerican farmer. The tap-lines are called rent, interest, dividends,\r\nprofits, royalty, taxes, tariffs, speculation, manipulation, inflation,\r\nstock dividends, stock watering--a vast tangle of pipes. Let us pay\r\none more visit to the jungle of Wall Street, and trace a few of these\r\nbiggest tap-lines, which make it necessary for you to break your back\r\nall day pumping water for idlers and parasites, before you can get a\r\nmouthful to drink.\r\n\r\nWhen they teach you about corporation finance in high school and\r\ncollege, this is how they picture it: Some men put their savings,\r\nearned by honest labor, into a company, and buy machinery, and\r\nmanufacture goods, and sell them at a competitive price, and so of\r\ncourse the profits belong to them, and it all is fair and square, and\r\na beautiful system, under which the public gets an abundant supply of\r\ncheap goods. Such a pretty picture these capitalists manufacturers of\r\nschool text-books prepare--with money they get from Wall Street, and\r\nwhich they parcel out, in the form of commissions to school boards and\r\nschool superintendents!\r\n\r\nBut what are the real facts? Well, the first thing the big corporation\r\nfinancier does is to seek out some form of special privilege, some\r\nopening through which he knows that he can make quick and certain\r\nprofits. Understand, I am not talking about the fake schemes, got up\r\nby fellows whose purpose is to unload worthless stocks. The Department\r\nof Justice estimates that such operations have taken three billion\r\ndollars from the public since the war; but that is merely small change,\r\ncompared with the gains of the real insiders, the perfectly legal and\r\nrespectable gentlemen who finance our business affairs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is a franchise or public privilege you are seeking; in\r\nthat case you buy it from a legislature or city council. Or perhaps it\r\nis land; in that case you employ shrewd lawyers and commit wholesale\r\nevasions of public land laws. Or you buy tariff favors; or you get a\r\npatent from an inventor by giving him a few shares of stock; or you get\r\nsecret favors from railroads or other corporations, by giving stock to\r\nthe officials. There are so many ways and combinations of ways, that I\r\nshould need a volume to tell about them. Whatever the “good thing” may\r\nbe, you get it, and then you take it to your friend the big banker, and\r\n“let him in” on it. He gives you in return a supply of that life-blood\r\nof industry which he dispenses--not real money, of course, but credit,\r\nbased upon the real money which other people have deposited in his\r\nbank. With this you can go out and order all kinds of real wealth--an\r\noffice, a factory, raw materials, labor--everything will come to you,\r\nAladdin’s magic was nothing compared to it. Carpenters will come, Judd,\r\nwith their saws and hammers and toil for days and months and years; it\r\nis a “job!”\r\n\r\nProfits are certain--you have seen to that; and on the basis of this\r\ncertainty you have fixed your capital. Understand, you never put up a\r\ndollar of real money--the big insiders never do, they would laugh at\r\nthe idea. You fix your capital as a function of your expected profits.\r\nThat sounds complicated, but is really very simple. Wall Street profits\r\naverage about 7%; therefore you fix your capital stock at fourteen\r\ntimes what your profits are going to be. After you get started, and\r\nyour graft works, you may find you are making twice what you expected;\r\nif that happens, you call your capital twice as much. If you make\r\n$70,000 during the year, your capital is $1,000,000. If next year you\r\nmake $700,000, you increase your capital to $10,000,000. If you make\r\n$7,000,000, your capital becomes $100,000,000. You, poor old laborer,\r\nwill surely think I am joking in such a statement; you cannot conceive\r\nsuch things taking place outside of a dream. Yet, I pledge you my\r\nhonor, this is the regular routine of Wall Street today, and I could\r\nfill pages of this book with a list of companies which have done this\r\nvery thing, quite as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nTake the Standard Oil Company of New York. I recall how, before the\r\nwar, this concern’s stock was quoted on the market at $700 a share,\r\nor seven times its par value. What did that mean? It meant that the\r\nRockefellers were old-fashioned, and afraid of the new corporation\r\ntricks; they kept their concern at its old capitalization of\r\n$15,000,000, while its profits were 70% on that amount. But the time\r\ncame when the public clamor got so intense that the Rockefellers had to\r\nhide like the rest; and what did they do? Well, in 1913, the Standard\r\nOil Company of New York declared a “stock dividend” of 400%; that is,\r\nit gave its stockholders four additional shares for each one they\r\nalready had; so the company now had a capitalization of $75,000,000,\r\nwhere formerly it had $15,000,000. Naturally, then, its profits didn’t\r\nlook so big; they had to be divided among five times as many shares.\r\nAnd then again, in 1922, the capital was multiplied by three, becoming\r\n$225,000,000. The company now pays 14% and that seems bad enough; but\r\nwhat would you say if you figured on the old capitalization and knew it\r\nwas paying 210% every year!\r\n\r\nThis is the device known as “stock dividends”--paste it in your hat,\r\nJudd! And paste this also: Stock dividends are not profits, according\r\nto a decision of the United States Supreme Court! And when you have\r\ndiluted down your capitalization like this, you are no longer making\r\nexcess profits, and so you no longer have to pay the excess profits\r\ntax! And so, of course, all the corporations hasten to adjust their\r\npaper securities; in 1922, more than $2,328,000,000 dollars were\r\ndistributed in the form of “stock dividends” to happy stockholders.\r\nThe Standard Oil Company of Indiana paid 2,900% stock dividends in one\r\nyear. The Brown & Sharpe Company, which makes tools for carpenters like\r\nyou, Judd, paid stock dividends of 16,000% in 1922! Don’t you see how\r\nthey’ve got you hog-tied?\r\n\r\nConsider our mighty steel trust, Judge Gary’s pet, and the darling of\r\nour government. I knew intimately the lawyer who was paid a million\r\ndollars to form it, and he showed me a lot of “inside stuff”; for\r\nexample, John W. Gates, Wall Street “plunger,” taking a private car\r\nload of steel magnates, prostitutes and champagne bottles on a three\r\nday orgy, riding about the country and buying steel plants for a joke,\r\nat any price the owners cared to ask! Well, when the joke was over,\r\nMorgan took the whole outfit away from him--he didn’t consider Gates a\r\nsufficiently sound man to carry such a great responsibility! So Morgan\r\nemployed my friend, James B. Dill, to make the trust law-proof, and he\r\nput out the common stock of $500,000,000, all pure water and a swindle\r\non the public. I knew an elderly widow who put all she owned into\r\nit, and it went to six cents on the dollar! But out of its monopoly\r\nof raw materials the trust made good in the end--in two years of the\r\nwar its net profits were equal to the full amount of the original\r\ncapitalization, something over $888,000,000!\r\n\r\nOr take the beef trust. Armour and Company started with $160,000, and\r\nall the rest has come out of profits. In a single year they distributed\r\nstock dividends of $80,000,000! Or take that Aluminum Company of\r\nAmerica, the family pet of the Mellons, that gets so many kinds of\r\nfavors from our government; they once declared a stock dividend of\r\n500%, and yet they can only pay their workers $3.36 per day! Or take\r\nthe bread trust, Wall Street’s newest peace baby; the General Baking\r\nCompany has increased the value of its investment 67,500% in nine\r\nyears! And out of what? Well, if you are an insider, and can go to\r\nthe right banks and get a sufficient “line” of credit, you can build\r\nhuge electric ovens, which will bake bread so fast and so cheaply as\r\nto wipe the little hand bakers off the map; they will come to you as\r\nwage-slaves, and you will have a monopoly of fresh bread in a great\r\ncity, and out of your profits you can pay lawyers and aldermen and\r\neditors and labor-sluggers, and be safe against every form of attack.\r\n\r\nThere is no use piling up examples, Judd. Suffice it to say, that\r\nevery big business in America is owned and run under that system; and\r\nyou pay for it. During the war you got your dollar an hour wages, and\r\nyou thought it was next door to heaven; but you see, for every dollar\r\nyou made, these Wall Street fellows were making tens of millions; and\r\nwhen it came to the spending of the money, each one of their tens of\r\nmillions was just as powerful, just as legal and as sweet-smelling, as\r\nyour pitiful one!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nWhen I was a youth, trying to find out about my country, one of the\r\nfirst things I learned was that its politics were corrupt. I lived in\r\nNew York City, and saw that corruption all about me, and the hideous\r\nruin of human lives; naturally I tried to figure out why these things\r\nhad to be. The explanation given me in school was that it was the\r\nignorant foreigners who crowded into our cities; they didn’t understand\r\nour institutions, they sold their votes, and delivered our political\r\nparties into the hands of bosses.\r\n\r\nIt happened that I had a certain relative--I won’t tell his name,\r\nsuffice it that he was a financial man, on his way to becoming one of\r\nour great millionaires. He wanted to break into New York, so he opened\r\nan office, and gave a big block of stock to Richard Croker, at that\r\ntime boss of Tammany Hall; he made another Tammany chieftain the head\r\nof his New York office--and that was all there was to it, he was “in,”\r\nand his firm took over the city’s business along that line, and all\r\ncity officials and employes were given to understand that they must\r\npatronize it. Later on my relative--he was very fond of me, and told\r\nme all his doings--named a certain man for treasurer of New York state\r\non the Democratic ticket; he smiled as he told me what that was going\r\nto mean, his firm would open offices all over the state and would get\r\nthe state’s business. After which my worthy relative proceeded to scold\r\nme for my budding “radicalism,” and to assure me that our big business\r\nleaders were all patriots and men of honor.\r\n\r\nThus I saw the game from the inside, and little by little I came\r\nto understand it. Yes, it was true that the boss paid the ignorant\r\nforeigners for their votes; but where did the boss get the money for\r\nthat purpose? The answer, though painful, was plain: he got it from\r\nmy relative; he got it from all such business men, seeking all such\r\nfavors and privileges from the state. And here was a further fact which\r\nwas plain--my relative did not pay the boss for nothing; he intended\r\nto get, and did get, a hundred times as much out of the bargain as he\r\npaid to the boss and to the political machine of the boss. And that,\r\nI found, was the universal rule of this game of graft; the boss was\r\nmerely an agent, set up by big business men to run the political\r\npart of their affairs; and as for the ignorant foreigner, he was a\r\nconvenience which the business man made use of, in politics as in the\r\nlabor market.\r\n\r\nIn the old days of the Tweed ring, the politicians used to steal\r\nour money outright; but that is over now, because every politician\r\nknows, just as every business man knows, that it is so much better\r\nto “make” money than to steal it; you can “make” so much more, and\r\nthere is no danger of being sent to jail. So nowadays the rule of our\r\npolitics is “honest graft.” The chiefs of Tammany Hall do not loot\r\nthe treasury; what they do is to receive blocks of stock in paving\r\ncompanies and construction companies, which do the work for the city\r\nat enormous profits; they own stock in the banks which handle the\r\ncity’s funds; they are in on all the big traction deals; they get\r\nup little pet companies, to do this or that service for the public\r\nservice corporations--to furnish them with ink erasers, or time-clocks,\r\nor chewing gum, at several times the market price; and all that is\r\nperfectly safe and regular, and instead of sending them to jail we envy\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI open my morning paper, and here is Arthur Brisbane, sneering at some\r\nyoung men in New York who are starting a paper called “The New Masses”:\r\nnobody in America wants to belong to the “masses,” and the young men\r\nought to call their paper, “How to Make a Million the First Year.” Yes,\r\nJudd, that is what everybody wants; but can everybody do it? That is\r\na point which Mr. Brisbane, multi-millionaire real estate speculator,\r\nfails to cover. But you see how it is: the very essence of “making a\r\nmillion the first year” is that you take it away from other people, who\r\nlose in the great business gamble, and remain the “masses,” in spite of\r\ndesperate determination not to.\r\n\r\nThere is a charming fable by an old-time Italian named Pestolozzi,\r\nto the effect that the little fishes in the pond held a meeting to\r\nprotest against the cruelty of the big pike; and the pike considered\r\ntheir protest and declared the matter should be remedied by a decree\r\nto the effect that every year two little fishes should be permitted to\r\nbecome pike. The fable does not tell us how the little fishes took that\r\noffer; but if they had been little American fishes they would have been\r\ndelighted, and would have called it “liberty.”\r\n\r\nWhether or not some particular little fish becomes a pike is a matter\r\nof interest to that little fish, but it does not change the social\r\nsystem. The “masses” remain, and by their labor produce the wealth, and\r\nthe “classes” take it away from them. What I am trying to make clear\r\nto you, friend Judd, is that when you admire the possessor of a bit\r\nof juicy graft, what you are really admiring is the power to rob you;\r\nbecause it is your wealth the robber is getting, there is no other\r\nwealth for him to get. The old-fashioned criminal graft came out of\r\nthe tax-payers; and the new fashioned “honest graft” comes out of the\r\nconsumers of gas and electricity and telephones and transportation and\r\nall other services. Every dollar of profits, whether legitimate or\r\nillegitimate, is either paid by the consumer, or else it is written\r\ndown as obligations, covered by “securities” of some sort, stocks or\r\nbonds, and forever after its claim is sacred, and the courts will\r\nprotect its right to draw tribute from the consumer to the end of all\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nTake our railroads, for example; the history of American railroads is\r\na history of bribery and fraud, continued through generations, and of\r\nstock-watering and speculation monstrous beyond belief. The common idea\r\nis that two-thirds of our railroad securities are water. LaFollette\r\nsucceeded in getting a provision for a “physical valuation” of the\r\nrailroads, and I saw, tucked away in an obscure corner of a newspaper,\r\nthe results for two Southern lines--the water was nine dollars out of\r\nten! So the “physical valuation” project was apparently dropped--at\r\nleast, I can’t find out any more about it. And now what has happened?\r\nThe courts have decided that the railroads are entitled to a “fair\r\nreturn” on their present paper values; it is the law of the land that\r\nthey are guaranteed 5½% on their securities, and if they fail to earn\r\nthat, the government makes it up to them!\r\n\r\nThe same principle applies to the public service companies in all our\r\ncities and towns. No matter by what bribery their franchises may have\r\nbeen gained, no matter how many oceans of water may have been pumped\r\ninto their stocks, these values are sacred, and no legislature may pass\r\na law reducing prices below a “fair return.” We have public service\r\ncommissions which are supposed to put a stop to future stock-waterings\r\nand fraud, and to protect the public against unjust rates; but what\r\nare these commissions doing? The answer is, they are selling us out;\r\nand the proof is published daily, in the stock market quotations for\r\nthe securities of these corporations. That is one kind of proof to\r\nwhich there is no answer, Judd; other people may be fooled about money\r\nmatters, but the men who buy and sell in Wall Street are not fooled\r\nfor long; they watch earnings, and, automatically every stock takes\r\nthe ranking to which its dividends entitle it. If public service\r\ncommissions are protecting you and me in our rights, then the stocks of\r\npublic service corporations are of no use for purposes of speculation\r\nin Wall Street; on the other hand, if Wall Street is scrambling for\r\nthem, and boosting the prices of them, it means one thing and one\r\nonly--the big thieves have broken down the defenses we built up against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnd what are the facts? Here are the “high” quotations for some of our\r\nbiggest public utility corporations, the first figure for the year\r\n1921, and the second for the year 1925; the gains speak for themselves:\r\nAmerican Gas, 49, 79; American Light and Traction, 112, 249; Middle\r\nWest Utilities, 24, 112; Public Service Company of N. Illinois, 82,\r\n126; Standard Gas and Electric, 17, 59; Western Power, 30, 86.\r\n\r\nAnd incredible as it may seem, Judd, here is our old friend the “stock\r\ndividend!” Yes, even in public utilities, they are getting away with\r\nso much that they have to hide it! American Water Works gave five new\r\nshares for one old share; Cities Service Co. the same! Western Power\r\ndeclared a 50% stock dividend; Columbia Gas and Electric gave three\r\nnew shares “of no par value” for one old share. Here is a new trick,\r\nJudd--no par value any more, so you will never be able to say what that\r\ncorporation ought to earn! You will never be able to raise the awkward\r\nquestion how much real money was put into the concern at the start!\r\nThey won’t have to declare any more stock dividends, for the old ones\r\nwill serve to infinity; as the cheerful phrase has it, the sky is the\r\nlimit!\r\n\r\nLook, Judd; three years ago we had a big “power fight” in Southern\r\nCalifornia. It was proposed by public-spirited people that the state\r\nshould issue bonds for $500,000,000 and develop its own water power.\r\nOur big newspapers raved at the wicked idea; they told you that would\r\nbe “Socialism,” and you believed them, and voted down the proposal. So\r\nnow the great power companies have the field without a rival; they are\r\nspending the money--and where are they getting it? Selling stocks and\r\nbonds in Wall Street, of course; and on what basis? What basis could\r\nthere be--except the fancy prices they intend to charge you for power,\r\nwith the permission of the corrupt public authorities of this state?\r\n\r\nAnd one thing more, Judd; when they come to present their bills--with\r\nthe permission of the public service commission--they are going to\r\ninclude in the items the amount of $501,605.68 which they paid in the\r\npolitical campaign to bamboozle you! Yes, Judd, they will do that, and\r\nyou will never know it, because it will be classified as “organizing\r\nexpenses,” or “advertising,” or something like that; and how carefully\r\ndo you go into the reports of the public service corporations which\r\nsupply you with power? Six power companies admitted before the\r\nlegislative investigating committee that they had paid that sum in the\r\ncampaign; the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the old established\r\nrulers of this community, the purchasers of our local government, put\r\nin the tidy sum of $133,933.80. And so here is a sentence to paste in\r\nyour hat, Judd:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Not only do they rob you; they make you want to be robbed, and\r\n     they make you pay them for teaching you to want to be robbed!_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd one more, Judd--a “slogan” for the next campaign:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Letting yourself be robbed is Americanism; defending yourself\r\n     against robbery is Socialism!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nYou read about the rich growing richer and the poor poorer, and you\r\nwonder why the poor have stood it. Why didn’t they “do something.”\r\n\r\nThe answer is, they tried to, but the rich wouldn’t let them. It is of\r\nthe nature of wealth to be powerful, and to use its power to protect\r\nand perpetuate itself. Jesus said: “Whosoever hath, to him shall be\r\ngiven; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which\r\nhe seemeth to have.” You have there the whole of political and economic\r\nscience, and no professor in any capitalist university can say it any\r\nbetter. The history of our country is a record of incessant struggles\r\non the part of the poor, continually repressed and brought to naught\r\nby the rich. The most powerful weapon in this conflict has been, of\r\ncourse, the government; the rich have had it, and the poor have been\r\ntrying to take it away from them, and have failed.\r\n\r\nIn their battle the rich have had four lines of defense. First, the\r\nelections; they put up the money, and subsidize a political party, and\r\ncarry on a campaign of falsehood and abuse, and buy votes and stuff\r\nballot-boxes, and so defeat the poor at the polls. Second, assuming\r\nthey fail in this, comes the legislative line of defense; they sow\r\ndiscord in the ranks of their opponents, they buy up some of their\r\nrepresentatives, they delay action and confuse the public and plant\r\n“jokers” in the bills which are passed. And then comes the third line,\r\nthe courts; the rich have named as judges their own retainers and\r\ncorporation attorneys, their fellow club-members and table-companions,\r\nthoroughly trained in reference for property; and these judges discover\r\nthe “jokers” in the laws, and declare them unconstitutional, null and\r\nvoid. Fourth, assuming these three lines fail, the rich simply defy the\r\nlaws; resting upon the certainty that their government will not punish\r\nthem; and it does not.\r\n\r\nDo these seem to you extreme statements? Each one can be proved a\r\nthousand times over by the well-established facts of our history. In a\r\nprevious letter I made the assertion that out of fifteen presidential\r\nelections since the civil war, fourteen were carried by the party\r\nwhich had the biggest campaign fund. Here are the figures, direct from\r\nheadquarters--the “Wall Street Journal.” The winning party is listed\r\nfirst:\r\n\r\n_1868_, Rep. $150,000, Dem. $75,000; _1872_, R. $250,000, D. $50,000;\r\n_1876_, R. $950,000, D. $900,000; _1880_, R. $1,100,000, D. $355,000;\r\n_1884_, D. $1,400,000, R. $1,300,000; _1888_, R. $1,350,000, D.\r\n$855,000; _1892_, D. $2,350,000, R. $1,850,000; _1896_, R. $16,500,000,\r\nD. $675,000; _1900_, R. $9,500,000, D. $425,000; _1904_, R. $3,500,000,\r\nD. $1,250,000; _1908_, R. $1,700,000, D. $750,000; _1912_, D. $850,000,\r\nR. $750,000, Prog. $325,000; _1916_, D. $1,400,229, R. $2,012,535;\r\n_1920_, R. $3,986,383, D. $2,891,252; _1924_, R. $3,359,478, D.\r\n$845,520, Prog. $225,936. Total of winning party, $49,683,369; of\r\nlosing party, $14,797,001.\r\n\r\nAs to ballot-box stuffing, Judd I am not making any guesses, but\r\ntelling you what I have seen with my own eyes. In my ardent youth I\r\ngave my services as election-watcher for the “reform” ticket in New\r\nYork City, and came very close to getting my head stove in, for trying\r\nto prevent the counting of illegal ballots by Tammany heelers; the\r\nthing that saved me was the fact that as the returns came in, the\r\nheelers perceived that they had won anyhow, and didn’t need the extra\r\nballots! Lincoln Steffens, in his book, “The Shame of the Cities,”\r\ntells how in Philadelphia the machine used to vote “dead dogs and\r\nnegro babies”; the title of that chapter was “Philadelphia Corrupt\r\nand Contented,” and today you can take out the name Philadelphia, and\r\ninsert the name of any big American city you please.\r\n\r\nThe poor have never carried a national election in this country since\r\nthe civil war, and the reason is simple, they have been too poor.\r\nIt costs a million dollars to put a single piece of literature into\r\nthe hands of all the voters in our country; and when you figure the\r\ncost of the speakers and the halls and the advertising and the bands\r\nand the red fire and the rockets and the flags and the bunting and\r\nthe bunk, you have a total of several times as many millions as ever\r\ngot acknowledged in the reports of campaign expenditures turned in\r\naccording to law. The poor cannot produce these millions; and even\r\nif they had the money, they could not get the publicity, because the\r\ncapitalist papers will not print the arguments of the poor, even as\r\nadvertisements--I know, because I have tried it; the radio will not\r\naccept speakers for the poor--I know, because I have tried that also.\r\n\r\nAs for the second line of defense, the breaking up of popular movements\r\nand the bedeviling of popular legislation, the proof is the story of\r\nevery “reform” movement that has taken office anywhere in the United\r\nStates. Never once since the Civil War have the people succeeded in\r\nmaking effective a major piece of legislation in their own interest;\r\nthe proof of which extreme statement lies in the statistics of real\r\nwages in the United States--the fact that in the richest nation in the\r\nworld, for the period of its greatest productivity and expansion, the\r\npoor have been growing poorer. We have had campaigns of “muckraking,”\r\nyes; I remember how, many years ago, “Everybody’s Magazine” printed\r\na boastful editorial, listing all the crusades they had carried on\r\nfor the benefit of the people; and I wrote, challenging them to point\r\nout one single practical result which had come of all their efforts,\r\nto show where they had been able to divert a single dollar from the\r\npockets of the rich into the pockets of the poor; and “Everybody’s” did\r\nnot take up that challenge, nor even print it. To complete the story,\r\nnote that “Everybody’s” has long since forgotten that it ever had any\r\ninterest in social justice, and so has every other magazine of big\r\ncirculation in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe third line of defense, the courts: that is the most shameful story\r\nof all, and for it I reserve a separate letter. For the moment let me\r\nmake just one statement: there is not in the Constitution of the United\r\nStates one line which entitles the courts to throw out or to annul an\r\nact of Congress. Such action is pure and absolute usurpation, a power\r\nwhich the courts have seized; and they have got away with it for one\r\nreason and one only--because it has served the interests of the rich.\r\nOn that basis they have vetoed law after law, culminating in the\r\nrecent decision which sentenced a million little children to slave out\r\ntheir lives in cotton mills and coal mines.\r\n\r\nAnd then, the last line of defense: I say that when the rich do not\r\nlike the law, they simply defy it. The proof of that statement is\r\nwritten on the front pages of our newspapers day by day. The rich are\r\nmaking no pretense of obeying the prohibition law; I have had drinks\r\noffered to me, in defiance of law, in the offices of leading senators\r\nand government officials. The big bootleggers today are eminent\r\ncitizens, on terms of equality with bankers and judges and corporation\r\nattorneys; and yet we speculate about the spread of the crime wave!\r\n\r\nBut the crimes that interest me, Judd, are not house-breaking and\r\nsafe-cracking, nor even bootlegging; for these take only a few lives,\r\nand destroy only a few characters. What I am after are those crimes\r\nwhich degrade whole populations, beating down their standards of\r\nlife, and depriving them of hope and self-respect; those crimes which\r\nsap the foundations of free institutions. And those are the crimes\r\nof big business--in other words, the crimes committed by bankers and\r\njudges and corporation attorneys. I remind you of the report of a\r\nUnited States Comptroller of the Currency, published in 1916--to the\r\neffect that out of 7,613 national banks, 2,743, or 36% were “guilty\r\nof usury”--and this “according to sworn reports, made by the banks\r\nthemselves!” But do you see any procession of national bankers going to\r\nthe federal penitentiaries for robbing the poor? You do not!\r\n\r\nOr take the Sherman Anti-trust law; the most flagrant case in our\r\nhistory of the nullification of a major statute by the will of the\r\nrich. This was a law forbidding combination in restraint of trade;\r\nit stood in the way of the profits of big business, and big business\r\nsimply refused to give those profits up. The trust magnates fought\r\nthe government--for thirty-one years that fight has been going on, in\r\nthe courts, at the polls, in the kept press, and secretly by intrigue\r\nand bribery. Those public officials who could not be bought have been\r\nslandered and driven out of public life--Theodore Roosevelt, for\r\nexample; and the result is that today the law is an absolute dead\r\nletter. The great combinations are being formed, all the way down the\r\nline--the power trust, the bread trust, the radio trust, the movie\r\ntrust; they are establishing monopolies and holding up prices and\r\nwatering stocks a thousand or ten thousand per cent; and what is the\r\nstate of public opinion on the subject? One of the most conspicuous of\r\nthe law-breakers, Secretary Mellon of the Aluminum trust, sits in our\r\ncabinet at Washington, and dictates a law cutting his own income taxes\r\nin half, and another law keeping his income taxes secret!\r\n\r\nOr take what happened in the case of the Standard Oil trust. In 1911\r\nthe Supreme Court ordered it to “dissolve,” the purpose being to\r\nrestore competition. The concern made a paper “dissolution,” into\r\nthirty-two separate companies, but for some reason these little\r\ncompanies remained in complete and brotherly harmony: so much so\r\nthat in ten years they increased the market value of their stocks\r\n_thirty-five times_, and the dividends paid, including of course the\r\nstock dividends, amounted to _eighteen times the total capital when the\r\ndissolution took place_! In other words, what Standard Oil did was to\r\nmake a joke of the law, obeying it on paper and defying it in reality.\r\nYet, are the securities of this criminal organization any the less\r\nvalid, any the less sacred under the law? Are its dollars any the less\r\nreal? To ask such a question is to be a “Bolshevik.”\r\n\r\nThroughout our history, ever since the Civil War, we have had scandals,\r\nand government officials have been caught selling out the people to big\r\nbusiness thieves. The “credit mobilier,” the Tweed ring, the railroad\r\nland steals, the Ballinger land steals, the airplane steals, the\r\nwar-contract frauds, the Sinclair and Doheny oil steals--one could name\r\nscores of such. Here and there efforts were made to punish the thieves;\r\nbut in no case was the stolen money recovered. All those billions of\r\nfraudulent dollars exist today in Wall Street, in the form of perfectly\r\nsound and respectable securities, standing on a par with all other\r\nvested property rights. You, and the rest of our toiling masses,\r\ncontinue to pay dividends and interest upon them; as the system stands,\r\nand so long as it stands, you must pay tribute to all that mass of\r\nstolen wealth, before ever you can have one penny in your own pocket,\r\none morsel of food in your own mouth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nWe know by now what the word “privilege” means. Hundreds of thousands\r\nof people do not have to do useful labor in our society; they draw off\r\nthe profits of other people’s labor, and the good things of life flow\r\nto them in a stream so great as sometimes to overwhelm them. And this\r\nflow is guaranteed them for life, and to their descendants to the end\r\nof time. All our political teachings, all our economic calculations,\r\nare based upon the idea that this state of affairs is permanent; the\r\nright of property to draw interest, dividends and profits is inviolable.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that the favored ones of privilege believe in\r\nthe sacredness of such rights. Once upon a time the priests protected\r\nthem, and then the kings; now it is the judges, and here is our modern\r\nform of superstition, the worship of the Dead Hand. Our newspapers know\r\nnobody more wicked than the man who assails the courts; he is a demagog\r\nand an incendiary, and now and then some court reaches out its mighty\r\nhand and claps him into jail.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Judd, I take the risk, and point out to you that judges\r\nare men like other rich men. I have never seen statistics as to how\r\nmany are ex-corporation-lawyers, but the percentage must be close to\r\none hundred; for what else is there for a would-be judge to be, except\r\na corporation lawyer? He must be a “big” lawyer, before he is fit for\r\nthe bench; and how else can you be “big”--that is, earn a great deal\r\nof money--except by serving those who have the money? And how are you\r\ngoing to get your nomination, except by going to see the political\r\nboss who has the giving of nominations? And will the boss give you\r\nthis honor, without asking what use you are going to make of it after\r\nyou get it? When there are so many millions upon millions of dollars\r\nat stake, depending upon your judicial decisions? Really, Judd, if\r\nyou expect things like that to happen, you are as big a dunce as your\r\nindustrial masters think you!\r\n\r\nIt happens that I once knew intimately a very “big” judge; he was a\r\nmember of the Court of Appeals of the State of New Jersey, which is\r\nto say he was one of the five highest judges in a state which was\r\nextremely important, because many of our biggest corporations were\r\nformed under its safe and easy laws. At the same time the “big” judge\r\nwas a “big” corporation lawyer on the other side of the Hudson River,\r\nin New York state; in fact, he was the highest paid corporation lawyer\r\nin the city, which was surely going some; he was the author of “Dill\r\non Corporations,” the standard text-book in every law-school in the\r\ncountry. I have sat in James B. Dill’s library many an evening, and\r\nwatched him smoke big black cigars, and listened to him pour out his\r\nsoul. I will tell you the first story of his career, and then I will\r\ntell you the last.\r\n\r\nA young law-graduate, he got a job in the law department of a big\r\nrailroad, I think he said the New York Central; he was to defend\r\naccident suits, and the lawyer who took him in charge pulled open a\r\ndrawer in his desk and took out a list of the judges of the state. “You\r\nwill notice that some of these names are checked,” said the man. “When\r\nwe have cases, get them before one of those judges. Those are _our_\r\njudges.” Said Dill to me: “That was a young man’s first introduction to\r\nthe law.” I asked: “Is it as bad as that now?” He answered, “There are\r\ntwenty-two judges of the supreme court in New York state, and nineteen\r\nof them are crooked. I can say to each one, ‘I know whose man you are,’\r\nand not one will dare contradict me.”\r\n\r\nAnd then the last story. Dill had just been appointed to his high post\r\nin New Jersey, and the day after the news was published, one of his\r\nold college friends came to see him, and brought him an offer from E.\r\nH. Harriman, railroad magnate, to retain his services in New York for\r\nfifty thousand dollars a year, “and you needn’t do any work.” Dill said\r\nto his friend, “What case has Harriman got before the Jersey courts?”\r\nThe friend replied that it was just general principles, the great\r\nmagnate liked to have friends on the bench. Dill answered, “You tell\r\nHarriman--being a fisherman you can explain what I mean--that a fat\r\ntrout does not rise to a fly.”\r\n\r\nMen do not change their skins when they put on black silk robes and\r\nmount the judicial bench. A hard-boiled, hard-fisted attorney for\r\nlabor-smashing employers’ associations, such as Butler of Minneapolis,\r\nwhose whole political career was an expression of the hateful arrogance\r\nof class-greed--when such a man is raised to the United States Supreme\r\nCourt, he does not alter his nature a particle, but goes right on at\r\nhis old fighting job and in his old fighting spirit; only now he has\r\nthe terrible power to say that acts of Congress are null and void. The\r\nConstitution gives no such power to nullify the will of the people; and\r\nyou don’t have to be a “big” lawyer to verify that--you can read the\r\nConstitution for yourself, and see. And then watch the use which these\r\nex-corporation-lawyers make of this stolen power! To protect the sacred\r\nright of great manufacturing corporations to employ child slaves! And\r\nlikewise the right of employers to underpay their women slaves! And\r\nlikewise the right of stock dividends to escape taxation! And likewise\r\nthe right of judges’ salaries to escape taxation!\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, when the rich pass laws in their own interest,\r\nand these laws are in contradiction to the Constitution, what happens\r\nthen? The answer is that the courts uphold these laws--and it matters\r\nnot how explicit the provisions of the Constitution may be. The\r\nsupposed-to-be sacred Constitution of the United States provides that\r\n“the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed”;\r\nand yet the legislature of New York state passed a law forbidding a\r\nman to keep a revolver in his home, and a New York lawyer fought that\r\nlaw to the highest courts, and was beaten. Here in California the\r\nConstitution provides that “every citizen may freely speak, write, and\r\npublish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse\r\nof that right; and no law shall be passed to restrain or abridge the\r\nliberty of speech or of the press.” How could words be more explicit?\r\nAnd yet we have a “criminal syndicalism” law, under which seventy\r\nmen are now in jail for their political opinions, no other offense\r\nhaving been even charged against them. I personally, as you know, was\r\narrested and held “incommunicado” under that law; my offense being\r\nthat I started to read the Constitution of the United States, while\r\nstanding upon private property with the written permission of the\r\nowner, and after notice to the authorities that I intended to exercise\r\nmy constitutional right.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you a curious detail, in connection with that incident. The\r\nday after I came out of jail I happened to meet on the street one of\r\nthe highest judges in this state--I know him because I play in tennis\r\ntournaments with his son. The old gentleman patted me on the back and\r\nsaid: “Go to it, my boy, you are absolutely right!” But when I asked\r\nhim to say that publicly, he didn’t think it would be proper; and when\r\nI asked him to join the Civil Liberties Union, and help to protect all\r\ncitizens in such rights, he didn’t think that would be proper, either.\r\nYou see how even the most liberal of judges is bound by red-tape and\r\nprecedent, and leaves it to others to defend the law.\r\n\r\nI have seen in Los Angeles a magazine office raided without warrant\r\nof law, and the editor, a war veteran, manhandled and thrown into\r\njail--all because the authorities objected to what this editor was\r\npublishing. And not only did the courts permit this, they tried the\r\nman, and would have convicted him if he had not run away. All over the\r\ncountry such things were done, with the full sanction of the courts.\r\nIn New York City federal agents arrested a man and held him in a room\r\nin an office building for three weeks “incommunicado,” and tortured\r\nhim until he flung himself out of the window and was smashed on the\r\npavement below. Two other men began holding meetings of protest against\r\nthis outrage, and they were “framed” on a charge of murder, and the\r\nlabor movement has so far raised and spent about a quarter of a million\r\ndollars to keep them from being hanged. That is the Sacco-Vanzetti\r\ncase, and you may learn about many as bad or worse from the American\r\nCivil Liberties Union, 100 Fifth Avenue, New York.\r\n\r\nAnd how it is with ordinary civil litigation, in which the poor seek\r\njustice against the rich? Here I do not have to ask you to take my\r\nword, for the scandal is so notorious that even capitalist authorities\r\nhave been forced to admit it. You see, there are eminent legal\r\ngentlemen, occupied in crushing the poor in major ways--the tariff, the\r\ntrusts, the banking graft, “tight money,” child labor, and so on--but\r\nwhen it comes to a poor widow seeking justice against an employer\r\nwho withholds her wages, these gentlemen think that the law ought to\r\npreserve an aspect of impartiality; it ought not be too obvious that\r\nthere is one law for the rich and another for the poor. For example,\r\na majestic plutocrat like ex-president Taft, now chief justice of our\r\nSupreme Court; when such a weighty personage denounces capitalist\r\njustice, you surely will believe what he says! Here he is, speaking\r\nbefore the Virginia Bar Association: “We must make it so that the poor\r\nman will have as nearly as possible an equal opportunity in litigating\r\nas the rich man, and, under present conditions, ashamed as we may be of\r\nit, this is not the fact.”\r\n\r\nNotice the delicacy of the phrasing, Judd: “as nearly as _possible_!”\r\nThere is nothing “utopian” about our chief justice! Just how possible\r\nit is for impotence to be equal to power, is something which has\r\nnot yet been shown to us; but evidently there is some limit to the\r\npossibility, for Dean Pound of the Harvard Law School speaks of the\r\nattitude of the law to the poor as “this neglect which disgraces\r\nAmerican justice.”\r\n\r\nFor my part, you understand, I do not expect the poor ever to get\r\nequal justice against the rich; it seems to me absurd to imagine such\r\na thing happening. The existence of riches in the world, at the same\r\ntime as poverty, is in itself the sum of all injustices; and so, if we\r\nreally care about justice, we must either make the rich as poor as the\r\npoor, or else make the poor as rich as the rich, or else strike a happy\r\nmedium between the two. This last is my solution and I hope to show you\r\nhow it can be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nWe have seen the poor struggling to protect themselves against the rich\r\nin the field of politics, and meeting with no great success. There is\r\nanother place where they struggle--in the labor market. Let us see what\r\nhappens to them there.\r\n\r\nSeeing the employers combining into larger and larger organizations, it\r\nnaturally occurred to the workers to combine, and sell their labor as\r\na unit. At first the employers made this action a crime, and a great\r\nmany working men went to jail, before the right of labor combination\r\nwas granted. Even now, it is only grudgingly granted; the employers\r\nin their hearts are still certain that anything which reduces their\r\nprofits is a crime, and through their courts they hedge the labor\r\nunions about with all sorts of restrictions. The doctrine of the\r\npresent hour is briefly this: that labor organization is all right,\r\nprovided it does not accomplish anything.\r\n\r\nYou, Judd, are a non-union man. You grew up in small places, and live\r\nnow in a suburban neighborhood which is like a small place, in that\r\neverybody knows everybody else, and the people you work for are not\r\nmuch better off than you are. You can leave your job any time you don’t\r\nlike it, and that gives you a sense of freedom. But suppose, Judd, you\r\nhad been raised in the slums of a city, and had to do your carpentering\r\non great buildings, under a firm of contractors; and suppose you found\r\nthat your freedom to leave your job involved the necessity of hunting\r\nanother job, under some contractor who belonged to the same employers’\r\nassociation, and paid the same scale, and followed the same working\r\nrules as your previous boss? You must see that this would make quite a\r\ndifference in your sense of “freedom.”\r\n\r\nOr suppose you had grown up in some industrial center, and worked for\r\nthe coal trust, or the steel trust, or the beef trust. You have read\r\n“The Jungle,” and know how the wage-slaves of Packingtown lived twenty\r\nyears ago. Well, Judd, they are living exactly the same way today. I\r\nsaid concerning “The Jungle” that “I aimed at the public’s heart, and\r\nby accident I hit it in the stomach”; the public insisted that some\r\npretense be made that their meat was better, but no one even pretended\r\nthat the workers were helped. And the same thing is true of the slaves\r\nof “King Coal”; it did not trouble the American people to learn that\r\nthe men who dug their coal were living in privately-owned empires,\r\nwhere the elemental rights of American citizens, and even of human\r\nbeings, had no existence.\r\n\r\nIn such places the only hope of the workers is to organize, and present\r\na solid front to their masters, and extort better terms by the threat\r\nof withholding their labor. For a hundred years the workers have\r\nbeen forging that weapon, and trying it out. There are about four\r\nmillion of them organized, out of the forty-two million wage-earners\r\nof the country, and that seems a pitiful few; but you know about\r\nthe leaven in the dough, Judd. Perhaps it never occurred to you to\r\nrealize the influence which the organized carpenters--some 315,000 of\r\nthem--exercise upon the lives of unorganized carpenters like yourself.\r\nThey set a standard, that would otherwise be unknown in the carpenter\r\nworld; they make it certain that no boss can get a really big job done\r\nat lower than the union scale--first, because it is hard to get a lot\r\nof skilled men together except through the unions, and second, because\r\nof the constant threat that a union organizer will get in among them.\r\nIt is strange to see a man like yourself, rather suspicious of unions,\r\nbecause of all the poison you absorb from the capitalist press--and yet\r\nat the same time profiting every working hour of your life from the\r\nsacrifices made by union men! Also it is strange to see employers who\r\nfight the unions, and denounce them, and boast of the contentment of\r\ntheir non-union workers--and make that contentment by paying the union\r\nscale, which otherwise neither the employer nor the men would ever have\r\ndreamed of! Once let the “open shop” bosses have their way, Judd, and\r\nthen see how a “free” carpenter’s wages will drop!\r\n\r\nWe have seen that there is in America a law for the rich, and quite a\r\ndifferent law for the poor; and that state of affairs is well known to\r\norganized labor, you may be sure. The unions never get far in their\r\neffort to raise their members’ standards, without encountering the iron\r\nfist of the government. I have shown you how the rich defy the laws\r\nthey do not like; but let no workingman, union or non-union, ever make\r\nthe mistake of trying that! There are jails and prisons, and also there\r\nis the hideous “third degree,” with torture-chambers where workingmen\r\nare taught their “place”--of subjection and impotence.\r\n\r\nLet me give you an illustration, Judd, right here at home, in this\r\nparadise of the “open shop.” We have a group of employers’ federations,\r\nwith an iron-clad policy of class warfare. An employer who “panders to\r\nthe union element” cannot get any business, he cannot get credit with\r\nthe banks--they smash him as you would a louse. And, of course, they\r\nkeep a card list of men who belong to unions, they follow a man up--the\r\ngrim device known as the “blacklist.” And all this quite openly, it is\r\nthe industrial policy of Los Angeles, and its boast. And do you hear\r\nanything about its being a violation of law? Do you see the publisher\r\nof the Los Angeles “Times” being sent to jail for advising employers\r\nnot to hire members of the carpenters’ union? No, Judd, you do not see\r\nthat!\r\n\r\nSo, naturally, the idea occurred to the workers that two could play\r\nat this game. If the employers could refuse to do business with\r\nthem, obviously they could refuse to do business with the employers.\r\nSo they tried it; and then what happened? Why then there appeared\r\nsuddenly a new crime in the calendar of the law; a monstrous form of\r\nwickedness known as the “boycott!” It was a “conspiracy,” a plot to\r\nruin a business man and deprive him of his property; and the judges\r\nwere called upon to forbid it, and they did so. For violation of\r\nsuch a judge-made “law,” the Danbury hatters--union workingmen of\r\nConnecticut--were fined $240,000; and the United States Supreme Court\r\nupheld that decision. Afterwards union labor succeeded in getting a\r\nlaw in their favor through Congress, and now the courts are engaged\r\nin paring that down to nothing. Workingmen may boycott their own\r\nemployers, but not other employers! But do you ever see employers\r\nlimited to blacklisting their own workingmen?\r\n\r\nI have shown you the judges taking by force the right to annul laws of\r\nCongress. Confronting the emergencies of labor strife, these judges\r\nproceeded to invent another weapon, known as the “injunction”; which\r\nmeans in brief that any ex-corporation-lawyer on the bench will issue\r\nan order forbidding workingmen to do anything that the corporations do\r\nnot want them to do; and the workingmen have to obey that order, or\r\nelse the judge will send them to jail for any length of time that the\r\ncorporation may desire; and there is no jury trial, and no defense, and\r\nno redress--the workingmen just go to jail!\r\n\r\nWhat these injunction judges have forbidden labor to do makes a catalog\r\nover which you might have a good laugh, if you could forget all the\r\nheartbreak and agony of the poor that is summed up in the preposterous\r\nsentences. All the hopes that were blasted, the pitiful hopes of a\r\nlittle better food for a sick wife, of a chance to keep the children\r\nin school! Such things are the meaning of a strike to workingmen; and\r\nsuddenly a grim personage in a black silk robe lifts a club and smashes\r\nthese hopes over the head! As I write, some clothing workers of New\r\nYork are on strike, and a judge has issued an injunction, forbidding\r\nthem, not merely to picket the shops of their boss, but to go within\r\nten blocks of the place! In the West Virginia coal fields, they are now\r\nforbidding mass-meetings, forbidding the use of money in unionizing the\r\nmines, and even the use of tent-colonies for the families of miners\r\nwho have been ejected from company houses! In Oklahoma they recently\r\nforbade miners to pray! In Minneapolis I talked with a labor man who\r\nhad spent six months in jail for violating an injunction, and he gave\r\nme the thing to read, a list of prohibitions that would fill a couple\r\nof pages of this book; as the man said, “I’d have broken the law if I’d\r\nwaked up in the night and disliked my boss.”\r\n\r\nAnd every year they are encroaching a little farther on the rights\r\nof the workers, and of all citizens. They are trying to set up the\r\nprinciple that it is a conspiracy against the public welfare to\r\ninterfere with “essential industries.” Thirty years ago, when Grover\r\nCleveland sent in Federal troops over the head of Governor Altgeld of\r\nIllinois, and smashed the strike of the railwaymen, and threw Gene Debs\r\ninto jail, it was considered quite a startling action. But now we have\r\ngot used to things like that, and in 1922 they imprisoned eight railway\r\nleaders in Los Angeles, calling their strike “a conspiracy to interfere\r\nwith the mail.” Now President Coolidge, in his message to Congress,\r\nis calling for a law to forbid all such strikes, and take off the\r\nshoulders of the judges the embarrassment of having to create the law!\r\n\r\nAnd so, once more, Judd, do you see why the rich are growing richer\r\nand the poor poorer? Do you see why the index figures of a university\r\nprofessor revealed that the wage-earners of America, taken as a\r\nwhole, were five per cent poorer today than in 1890? I told you that\r\nriches and poverty are not caused by the Will of God, nor yet by any\r\nimplacable Economic Law, but purely and simply by the actions of\r\nmen, driven by the basest of all human impulses, which is greed. And\r\nhere you see, Judd, exactly what these actions are. Every time an\r\nex-corporation-lawyer on the bench issues an injunction which smashes\r\na strike, he is reducing the average real wages of the workers of\r\nAmerica; he is taking away a little more from the poor, and handing\r\nit to the rich--and that is the job for which the rich set him up in\r\noffice, and bought him his black silk robe!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nI don’t know whether you ever played poker, but I did a few times in\r\nmy naughty youth. I recall a game known as “freeze-out”; you played\r\ntill you lost all your money, and the game ended entirely when one\r\nman got all the chips. That is our social system--a colossal game of\r\n“freeze-out,” with winter and disease and death to clear the players\r\nfrom the board. Those who lose at the game are the workers of the world.\r\n\r\nYou, Judd, must realize that you are in an unusual position for a\r\nworker grown old; you own two lots and three houses, and can live\r\npartly on the rent. But how many others are there like that? Consider\r\nthe statement given out this month by the Industrial Accident\r\nCommission of California: “One million men and women of America\r\nsuffered disabling accidents in industries this year.” Assuming that a\r\nworkingman puts in forty years, as you have done, what are his chances\r\nof getting off without a disabling accident? There being forty-two\r\nmillion people gainfully employed, the chances would appear to be one\r\nin twenty; but of course only part of the disabling is permanent--the\r\nvictims get well, and go back to be disabled again. The number of\r\naccidents increased 30 per cent in 1924, so you see your chances grow\r\nless and less.\r\n\r\nThe worst you got, Judd, was a rupture. But suppose you had been one\r\nof the 21,232 to be killed; or suppose you were of the 105,629 who\r\nsuffered “permanent partial disability” last year; or suppose that you\r\nhad eight or ten children, instead of one or two; or that your wife,\r\ninstead of dying in an accident as she did, had been crippled, and left\r\nupon your hands for life. Do you think you or your heirs would still\r\nhave the two lots, and the three houses, and the fine American sense of\r\nsecurity?\r\n\r\nLook, old friend, here are some figures worked out from insurance\r\ntables by the National City Bank of New York, the richest bank in the\r\ncountry. They are trying to persuade people to take out insurance, so\r\nthat the money will come back to Wall Street for them to use in stock\r\ngambling. Taking 100 people 25 years old, they ask what will be the\r\nposition of these same people at the age of 65; and they say 1 will\r\nbe independent, 4 will be well to do, 5 will be working for a meagre\r\nliving, 36 will be dead, “many of them for want of attention that money\r\nwould have secured,” and 54 will be dependent upon others. “Out of the\r\nentire 100, only 5 will be in satisfactory circumstances.” There you\r\nhave a picture of what the richest nation in the world has been able to\r\nachieve in the way of sound human happiness!\r\n\r\nOur Mother Nature is a wasteful parent, who creates many millions of\r\nsalmon eggs in order to produce one salmon. It is the same way with\r\nhuman life also in its dark beginnings; history is a tale of mighty\r\nempires arising only to be destroyed again, and of populations wiped\r\nout by plague and famine and slaughter. But now the light of reason is\r\nbeginning to dawn; a few of us have the idea that human energies might\r\nbe rationally guided, and that men might cease to spend their time\r\ndigging holes in the sand and filling them up again.\r\n\r\nConsider war. Women bear children with much pain, and raise them with\r\nloving care, and then send them out, at the very prime of their lives,\r\nto be blown to pieces by shot and shell. Other men in factories, who\r\nmight be making the means of human happiness--automobiles and radio\r\nsets and books and music--these men are making explosives to wipe out\r\nwhole cities, and gases to poison the inhabitants. In the late war\r\nwe destroyed 30,000,000 human beings and $300,000,000,000 worth of\r\ntreasure, the product of a whole generation of useful toil.\r\n\r\nThey promised us that this war was to be the last, but what are the\r\nprospects? In 1912 our government spent for defense nearly a quarter\r\nof a billion dollars, and our 1926 budget for the same purpose is more\r\nthan three times that amount. In 1920 the Bureau of Standards analyzed\r\nour budget and found that expenses for wars, past and future, composed\r\n93 per cent thereof. Think of it, Judd, a great government spending one\r\ndollar to save life and property, and thirteen dollars to destroy it!\r\nOf course, the military men will say that the thirteen dollars are to\r\nprevent other nations from destroying us, but the obvious fact is that\r\nwhen we spend this money on armaments we cause other nations to do the\r\nsame, so we might as well do our own destruction and have it over with.\r\n\r\nOr consider child labor. We take a million children out of school and\r\nput them into factories and mines, thus stunting them in body and\r\nspirit, and when they grow up into cripples, defectives, criminals\r\nand grafters, we pay ten or a hundred times what we got out of their\r\nchildhood labor! Or consider crime, which is caused by the presence of\r\nextreme poverty alongside extreme wealth. Including criminals and those\r\nwho catch them, this factor of waste keeps more than 700,000 persons\r\nout of productive work. Or take prostitution, caused by poverty and low\r\nwages of women in industry. There are over a quarter of a million women\r\nin our country who live by spreading vice and disease, and the American\r\nSocial Hygiene Association estimates that this costs us $628,000,000\r\nevery year.\r\n\r\nOr consider adulteration, the putting of worthless goods and poisonous\r\nfoods upon the market, all for profits, of course. Or the wastes of\r\nadvertising--the seekers of profits spending a billion and a quarter\r\ndollars a year, and keeping more than 600,000 people busy all the time,\r\nin order to persuade us to stop buying the worthy products of Jones and\r\nto buy the unworthy products of Smith. This is civil war within our\r\nindustry, and one of its weapons is fashion, the making of imbecile\r\nchanges in our goods every season, in order that we may be ashamed to\r\nwear our perfectly good clothes after the first year.\r\n\r\nOr take the wastes of mismanagement of industry. The so-called “Hoover\r\nCommittee” of the American Engineering Societies made an elaborate\r\nstudy of this field, and it is interesting to notice that this\r\nemployers’ body attributes 50 per cent of the blame to management and\r\nonly 25 per cent to labor. They estimate the percentage of waste in a\r\nfew great industries: Metal trades, 28 per cent; boots and shoes, 40\r\nper cent; textiles, 49 per cent; building, 53 per cent; printing, 57\r\nper cent; men’s clothing, 63 per cent. Notice that figure for building,\r\nJudd, and be sure you get what it means: out of 40 years you put in at\r\ncarpentering, 21 years went to no purpose, because those who directed\r\nyour labor were making money instead of making houses!\r\n\r\nOne great form of industrial waste is men and women willing to work,\r\nand able to work but unable to find work to do. I regard this as the\r\nbasic evil, the cause of most of the others, and I believe that it is\r\nan essential part of our present profit system, without which that\r\nsystem would break down. First, let us see exactly how widespread the\r\nevil is.\r\n\r\nI point out, Judd, that nowhere in these letters have I given you\r\nany Socialist figures about anything; in each case I go to the most\r\n“respectable” authorities, those who are least favorable to my point\r\nof view. In this case of unemployment I consult a volume prepared and\r\npublished with money derived from the estate of one of the richest\r\nlandlords and money-lenders that ever died in the city of New York. I\r\nrefer to the Russell Sage Foundation, and here is the sentence in which\r\nthey sum up their final figures on unemployment: “To conclude that,\r\naveraging good and bad years, from 10 to 12 per cent of all workers are\r\nidle all of the time, is probably an understatement of the situation.”\r\nThe book calculates the number gainfully employed at 42,000,000, and 12\r\nper cent of that is over 5,000,000.\r\n\r\nWhen you talk about five million people out of work it doesn’t mean\r\nmuch, because we haven’t the mental power to grasp such a thing. Let\r\nus say _one_ person out of work, and see what it means. It so happens\r\nthat before I sat down to my typewriter this morning the postman\r\nbrought a letter from such a person; twelve miles away from us, in the\r\ngreat rich city of Los Angeles, a war hero is begging a job, and his\r\nwife and children are starving. This hero encloses a visiting card,\r\nreading, “D. S. C.”--that means “Distinguished Service Cross”--and down\r\nin the corner is “Chevalier Legion d’ Honneur; Croix de Guerre,” the\r\ndecorations prized above all things in France. And on the back of the\r\ncard he has written: “Ex-soldier, bonus-pest, charity-dependent.” He\r\nencloses newspaper clippings: “Top-sergeant in the suicide squad of\r\nmachine gunners,” left for dead on the field, taken to base hospital,\r\nreturned to front, made lieutenant, more hospitals and medals--regular\r\nhero stuff, you see, and here he has been hunting any sort of job for\r\nmonths, and tells me how it goes:\r\n\r\n“Louise the baby is low from malnutrition. Virginia, the oldest, the\r\ninvalid around whom my book is written, coughs all night incessantly.\r\nWe are making our last stand. As completely isolated as though in the\r\nheart of the Sahara. Today I received my first offer of a good job in\r\nweeks, but it necessitates my providing at least $22 of special tools.\r\nIt’s on tractor transmission; I built them shortly after the armistice,\r\nbut when I entered Stanford University I was through with mechanics,\r\nand gave away my kit. I took my D. S. C. and other war junk down to\r\nmy favorite pawnbroker Saturday but they wouldn’t bring carfare to\r\nPasadena now.”\r\n\r\nSo here, you see, is one of the victims of our great game of\r\n“freeze-out”; and what was his weakness that caused him to lose in the\r\ngame? The answer is plain enough--he believed the propaganda of our war\r\nprofiteers and went over to France and risked his life and ruined his\r\nhealth and fortune--while 23,000 able business gentlemen stayed at home\r\nand made themselves into millionaires! “What price Glory,” Judd!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nI have said that unemployment is a disease of the profit system,\r\nincurable under that system. I am now going to show why, and I consider\r\nthese facts the most important in the whole world for a workingman to\r\nunderstand. They are perfectly simple--any child can grasp them; yet\r\nthey are never mentioned in any newspaper, and never taught in any\r\nschool. The reason is equally simple--any editor who publishes them, or\r\nany teacher who teaches them, immediately loses his job.\r\n\r\nI put them into a series of short sentences for you to paste all around\r\nthe rim of your hat and study while you are sawing timbers and mixing\r\ncement. First, then:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The boss is not in business for his health. Ask him!_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then, equally easy to verify:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The boss will make no more goods than he can sell at a profit._\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so, plainly enough:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Profits for the boss, wages for the workingman; no profits for\r\n     the boss, starvation and death for the workingman._\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far, every business man will agree; in fact, this is the doctrine\r\nthey hammered into your head during the Coolidge campaign, and it got\r\nthem seven million plurality. All right, then; and now let us suppose,\r\njust for the sake of arguing, that the Coolidge administration believed\r\nin allowing the rich to charge as high prices as they pleased for\r\ngoods, and to break strikes and beat down the wages of the poor; what\r\nwould happen then? Why, obviously the poor wouldn’t have the money to\r\nbuy so much goods or to furnish so much profits for the bosses; it\r\nwould be only the rich who had the money, and goods would be more and\r\nmore for the rich, and less and less for the poor. Take notice, Judd,\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury estimated that in 1919 the amount spent\r\nfor luxuries in our country was $22,700,000,000--and with millions of\r\nfamilies lacking bread!\r\n\r\nBut with the flood of goods pouring out from the machines, the rich\r\nfind it harder and harder to consume the product; they take to\r\nreinvesting their money, that is, using it to make more machines, to\r\nturn out more goods, to be sold for more profits. But already there\r\nare more goods than can be sold; there are no longer enough profits to\r\nsupply the demands of the great mass of heaped-up capital. So comes\r\na glut of goods, and factories have to shut down, and we have “hard\r\ntimes.” Just what are “hard times,” Judd? Paste this in your hat now:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Hard times are tenant farmers starving because they have raised\r\n     too much food!_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Hard times are weavers in rags, because they have made too much\r\n     clothing!_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Hard times are carpenters homeless, because they have built too\r\n     many houses!_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd finally:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Hard times are workingmen who have finished making the world for\r\n     their masters, and are ordered to move on to some other planet!_\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will say, Judd, that such absurd things could never happen. To that\r\nI answer, very simply:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _They are happening right now to several million Americans who are\r\n     hunting jobs and not finding them!_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis insanity of “hard times” comes periodically in our affairs, in\r\ngreat waves known as “business cycles”; they are due at intervals of\r\nfrom seven to ten years, and are just as inevitable as the tides of\r\nthe sea. Learned economists study the history of these tides of ruin\r\nand make charts and diagrams of them; but if you state the cause, you\r\nbecome an outcast from the business world; and so naturally nobody does\r\nstate it--except a few outcasts like myself.\r\n\r\nThe professors of economics admit that this trouble is caused by\r\n“over-production,” and we must get straight exactly what that means. It\r\ndoesn’t mean that we have produced more than we need; on the contrary,\r\nwe have millions living below the wage level of common decency--our\r\naverage wage is $1,200 a year, and the cost of keeping a family on the\r\nbare necessities is $2,000. But it doesn’t matter how much people need;\r\nthe thing that counts is what they can buy. I give you another slogan,\r\nand next time you meet a professor of economics, ask him about it:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _If you’ve got the price, you’re a consumer; if you haven’t got\r\n     the price, you’re a bum._\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, since we American consumers can’t buy our own product, the\r\nowners of the product--that is, the rich--have to look elsewhere for\r\ncustomers, and so comes the hunt for “foreign markets.” Understand\r\nme, I do not object to our going abroad for the things we can’t raise\r\nat home; to exchange automobiles and moving pictures for bananas and\r\ncoffee--that is normal business. What I am talking about is a glut of\r\ngoods that we can’t sell at home, but must sell abroad, under penalty\r\nof seeing our workers turned off to starve. We don’t take goods in\r\nexchange--oh no, that would break down our home industries, and we\r\nprotect them by a high tariff wall. What we take are paper promises to\r\npay us at some future date; we go on continually selling more than we\r\nbuy, and filling our bank vaults with these paper promises, and that is\r\ncalled a “favorable balance of trade.”\r\n\r\nBut all the highly developed nations, Britain and France and Germany\r\nand Italy and Japan, are in exactly the same plight as ourselves; they\r\nalso have more goods than their half-starved workers can purchase; they\r\nalso are looking for foreign markets, to save their business system\r\nfrom collapse. Each finds its chance of salvation in selling to the\r\nbackward nations, which cannot yet do their own manufacturing. So we\r\nrun upon this curious situation:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The existence of American industry depends upon our selling\r\n     cotton shirts to Chinamen, who are so poor they can’t afford but\r\n     one shirt at a time._\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, see the next step! Trying to save our own business system, we\r\nthreaten ruin to the business system of some other country, say Japan.\r\nNaturally, the business men of Japan don’t like that; so we have trade\r\nrivalry, and out of that we have war. The cause of modern war may be\r\nput into one sentence--and I beg you to realize that it’s no joke, but\r\nthe grimmest of grim realities:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _If we don’t go to war with other nations, they will take away\r\n     from us the chance to sell to Chinamen those cotton shirts of\r\n     which our workers have produced so many that they have to go in\r\n     rags._\r\n\r\n\r\nI could go on like that indefinitely, making funny sentences about\r\nthis funny system. I could tell the hilarious story of how Britain\r\nand Germany went to war to take away from each other the chance to\r\nsell shirts to Chinamen--and to Hindoos and Persians and Arabs and\r\nTurks, of course. When they had destroyed 30,000,000 human lives\r\nand $300,000,000,000 worth of goods you might think they would have\r\ncured their “over-production” for quite a while; but they had made a\r\nmiscalculation, and fought too long, and borrowed too much money from\r\nus, and so their governments are burdened with enormous fixed charges,\r\nand there is chronic unemployment in both Britain and Germany, and\r\nalmost a collapse in France.\r\n\r\nAnd how about us? We have that “favorable balance of trade,” so\r\nardently desired by the prosperity boosters; indeed, we have got such\r\na bellyful of it that for the first time we are forced to realize that\r\nit’s nothing but wind. Europe owes us, in one form or another, some\r\n$19,000,000,000, and can’t even pay the interest; they made no pretense\r\nof trying--until they had to borrow some more! Italy came, bowing low\r\nand grinning behind its cap, agreeing to pay several billions in the\r\ncourse of 65 years--on condition that we lend another $200,000,000\r\nright off! Germany did the same thing, and France will be doing it,\r\nprobably before these words see the light of day. Our great financiers\r\naccept these paper pledges, for the reason that they are stuck with\r\n$19,000,000,000 of them already, and can’t contemplate what will happen\r\nwhen the whole thing turns out to be wind. We go on adding about a\r\nbillion a year, because the only way we can keep our factories going is\r\nto ship our surplus goods abroad--and take nothing back, because that\r\nwould stop the factories!\r\n\r\nWe promised our people “prosperity,” you remember, if only they would\r\nvote for Coolidge; and they did so, good, patient souls; so now we\r\nhave to deliver it. The way of “prosperity” is to keep them working\r\nto feed and clothe Frenchmen and Germans and Italians and Chinamen\r\nand Guatemalans and Haytians--anybody who will send us a beautiful\r\nengraved sheet of paper promising to pay us 65 years from now! To be\r\nexact, Judd, they don’t even have to engrave the paper; we do that in\r\nWall Street, and they send us a “mission” of white or yellow or black\r\ngentlemen in frock coats, to sign opposite the red seal. So here, Judd,\r\nyou have this wonderful jazz system in its final, delirium stage--our\r\nwhole people starving themselves on half wages, and sending the surplus\r\nabroad, so that our rich men may fill their vaults with pieces of paper\r\nwhich they dare not permit to be redeemed! We already have more than\r\nhalf the gold in the world, and far from taking any more, we have to\r\nship some abroad now and then, to keep some debtor nation from going\r\nbankrupt!\r\n\r\nDon’t you wish, Judd, that you could find some benevolent storekeeper\r\nto do business with you on this ultra-modern jazz basis? Never, never\r\ncan he be persuaded to take your money, but takes only checks, and does\r\nnot cash them for 65 years; and if at any time you need money, you\r\nthreaten to go broke, and immediately he gives you cash and takes some\r\nmore checks; and if ever you try to send him a truckload of goods, to\r\npay off at least part of the debt, he holds up his hands in a fit of\r\nhigh-tariff horror and says he couldn’t think of taking goods, it would\r\nruin the people inside his store who have the jobs of making that same\r\nthing! “For God’s sake, take away your truck,” he exclaims. “Just mail\r\nme another paper promise, and anything in the place is yours!”\r\n\r\nI conclude with one more sentence for you to learn, Judd:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Our present system of “high finance” is a soap-bubble, which\r\n     differs from other soap-bubbles in just one respect--it is as big\r\n     as the world._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nThe essence of our industrial system is the private ownership of the\r\nmeans of production; with profit for the private owner as the motive\r\npower of industry. The capitalist produces the goods we need, and in\r\norder to get them we pay him everything above the bare means of keeping\r\nus alive and enabling us to raise the next generation. If this system\r\nshould break down, it is obvious that we must change to some form of\r\nsocial ownership of the means of production; instead of having the\r\ncapitalist produce for us, we must do it for ourselves, and the motive\r\npower will be, not the desire of the capitalist for profit, but our own\r\ndesire for the goods.\r\n\r\nWhat difference will that make in the industrial system? At first you\r\nmight see no difference at all. The worker will go to the factory,\r\nwhere he will find foremen and superintendents in charge, and a\r\ntime-clock keeping tab on him. On Saturday night he will get his pay\r\nenvelope, and will take the money and spend it at the stores. The goods\r\nproduced in the factory will be shipped to all parts of the world,\r\nto people who pay for them by checks, which go through banks and a\r\nclearing-house--you might follow the whole process, and fail to realize\r\nthere had been any change. At only one place would the difference\r\nappear--inside the pay envelopes. There being no longer any absentee\r\nowners, drawing off rent, interest and profits, those who do the work,\r\nwhether of hand or brain, will now be the only people to draw anything\r\nout; and consequently there will be considerably more in each pay\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\nWall Street propagandists are fond of figuring how much goes to labor\r\nand how much to capital, and proving that to wipe out the capitalist\r\nwould add only a small percentage, say ten per cent, to the share of\r\neach worker. This is a trick, for the reason that a great part of the\r\ncapitalist’s share appears, not as profits, but as various forms of\r\n“fixed charges” against the industry: the interest on bonds, the rent\r\nof land, the royalties to owners of various privileges. To give just\r\none illustration, the New York Central Railroad crosses a bridge near\r\nAlbany, and a private concern owns that bridge, and the railroad pays\r\none cent for every passenger, a small fortune every year. Our whole\r\nindustrial system is a tangle of grafts such as that; the railroads\r\nare plundered by right-of-way companies, sleeping-car companies,\r\nrefrigerator-car companies; industrial concerns are plundered by\r\nprivate railway lines, owned by “insiders,” or by companies having a\r\n“cinch” on repairs or materials or accessories. Just the bookkeeping on\r\nsuch rights is a vast industry, and the adjusting of them supplies a\r\nliving for thousands of lawyers and their clerks. To wipe all that out\r\nwill be to dump a mountain’s weight off the back of production.\r\n\r\nBut even suppose it was as the Wall Street propagandists argue--that\r\ncapital got only ten per cent--would that be the only gain for labor?\r\nNo, Judd, it would not; and here is the most important point that I\r\nhave to get across to you in these letters. The proposition may seem\r\ndifficult, but I beg you to put your mind on it and get it straight,\r\nfor it is not too much to say that all freedom and happiness for the\r\nworkingman in our time depend upon his understanding these matters, so\r\nthat the clever hired writers of privilege cannot befuddle his mind.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the percentage that goes to capital--whether ten per\r\ncent, as Wall Street claims, or thirty or forty per cent, as I could\r\nprove--nevertheless it is this percentage which causes our industrial\r\nills today. It is this surplus which, drawn off and re-invested in\r\nmore means of production, causes the glut of goods which we know as\r\n“hard times”; it is this surplus which causes speculation and panics,\r\nand turns the worker out to join the ranks of the “unemployed,” and to\r\nbeat down the wages of his fellows; it is this surplus which causes the\r\nsearch for foreign markets, and draws the great industrial nations into\r\nwar. Figure to yourself a body having an iron ring riveted about it. At\r\nfirst this ring makes no difference, but as the body grows it causes\r\nstrangulation, and the time comes when for all the agonies of that body\r\nthere is but one remedy, to cut the ring.\r\n\r\nCutting the ring is simply this: to take the surplus product away\r\nfrom capital and give it to labor; so instantly you have remedied the\r\nevil and relieved the pain. How so? Because labor now becomes able to\r\nconsume the entire product of industry. Labor can consume it, because\r\nlabor has the money to buy it. Before this, as we have seen, labor got\r\nonly part of the money, and so could buy only part of the product; the\r\nrest had to be either wasted by the rich, or sold abroad. But give\r\nlabor the full value, the actual equivalent in purchasing power of the\r\namount of goods produced, and so consumption balances production, and\r\nthe factories can work merrily, as many hours as we desire, turning out\r\nfor each and every one of us as much goods as we care to consume. The\r\nonly restriction is the basic law of social justice--that before any\r\nman consumes anything he must render to the community an equivalent\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe hired men of the exploiters do all they can to confuse this\r\nargument; I hear them laugh that I have some kind of deluded horror of\r\na surplus. We ought to save, they insist, and provide against a “rainy\r\nday”! Yes, of course--and not merely against rain, but against famine\r\nand earthquake and tornado. I have no objection whatever to a surplus;\r\nthe question is, who is to own that surplus--those who do the work, or\r\nthose who live as parasites? That makes all the difference; for when\r\na workingman has made too much wealth for his master, the workingman\r\nis out of a job; but when the workingman has made too much wealth for\r\nhimself, the workingman is on a vacation.\r\n\r\nHere is this great rich country of ours, with all its natural\r\nresources, its marvelous machines, its willing and clever workers; and\r\nwhen we have broken the iron ring we can produce goods for ourselves,\r\nand consume and enjoy them, and stay quietly within our own boundaries.\r\nNo longer do we keep our workers on starvation wages, and ship all\r\nour surplus products abroad, to be consumed by Frenchmen and Italians\r\nand Turks and Chinamen and Hindoos, in return for paper promises to\r\npay money to our capitalists! No longer do we have to go to war, to\r\nseize foreign markets from other capitalists! The workers now own the\r\nfactories, and also they own the working capital, and they produce\r\ngoods for use, and if we have foreign trade it is because we want\r\nthings from abroad, and not because we have to get rid of our surplus\r\nproduct under penalty of starving. This is what I describe as a Free\r\nSociety, Judd; I say that in such a society, with production rationally\r\nplanned, and all wastes removed, we should produce wealth in such\r\nquantities, so quickly and so easily--well, you would think I was\r\njoking. But leading engineers have told us that we have, in our machine\r\npower, the constant labor of _three billion slaves_. In thirteen\r\nindustries, figured by the capitalist, Mr. Babson, we have _88 times_\r\nthe productive power we used to have by hand labor. Just think what\r\nthat ought to mean!\r\n\r\nOr look at it another way. Twenty years ago Sidney A. Reeve, an\r\nengineering expert, calculated how much we wasted by the competitive\r\nproduction of goods, and in a big book full of tables and charts, he\r\nworked out the figure of 70 per cent waste. We have seen the Hoover\r\nCommittee, considering merely the wastes _inside_ each industry,\r\ngiving figures as high as 60 per cent of waste. Mr. Stuart Chase, in\r\nhis wonderful book, “The Tragedy of Waste,” figures 50 per cent as the\r\nminimum. Well, let us take the minimum, for a start. What does it\r\nmean? I answer:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _In a free society what we now have will cost us four hours labor\r\n     a day._\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd more than that, Judd--something absolutely vital to every poor man\r\nin our country:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _In a free society every man may work as many hours as he wants to\r\n     work, and get the full value of what he produces._\r\n\r\n\r\nSo now we can make what would have seemed at the beginning a bold claim:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _From a free society involuntary poverty will be banished._\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd finally--one sentence more--and I beg you to learn this one:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The end of involuntary poverty means the end of most prostitution\r\n     and crime, and of all war between civilized peoples._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting thing to study the development of human society\r\nthrough a long period of history. Men began in small tribes, in which\r\nthey were very much alike, and stood on an equal footing. These tribes\r\nfought, and absorbed one another, and grew more complex, with greater\r\ndifferences among the members; dukedoms and principalities arose, and\r\nthen kingdoms, and at last great empires, with rulers and subjects\r\nranged in classes, and the class lines rigidly drawn.\r\n\r\nIt was against such a form of society that our ancestors revolted; they\r\nhad a new theory of government, and established a new form--a republic,\r\nowned and run by its citizens, all standing on an equal plane. The\r\nprocess of evolution in the political world is still going on, and some\r\nday we shall see a world-wide federation of republics, in which the\r\nhuman race will share equal rights.\r\n\r\nIt is fascinating to realize that this same process is going on in the\r\nworld of industry. Here also we see the various enterprises struggling,\r\nand some winning and absorbing the others, until today we have\r\nindustrial monarchies and empires. It is not merely a figure of speech\r\nwhen we talk about coal barons and steel kings and emperors of finance,\r\nfor these men occupy the same positions and hold the same kind of power\r\nas the rulers of old days. And just as we saw revolutions in the field\r\nof politics, so we shall see them in industry. In fact, the first of\r\nthese great revolutions has taken place before our eyes; the workers\r\nof Russia are now trying to show us that a government of industry by\r\nthe citizens of industry is a possible thing and a step in progress.\r\nOur capitalist newspapers are sure that they must fail; but even if\r\nthey did, that would not upset the argument, for the first political\r\nrevolution in England failed, and the first two in France; but that has\r\nnot kept a whole string of other countries from turning into republics.\r\n\r\nThe way human beings learn is by trying; and we are in the stage of\r\nhistory where men are getting ready to try democracy in industry.\r\nThere will be mistakes, and a great deal of waste and suffering;\r\nnevertheless, we shall press on, and in the end we shall achieve a\r\nhigher type of society than anything conceivable under industrial\r\nmonarchy, or imperialism such as we have today.\r\n\r\nYou remember King Louis of France, the “grand monarch,” who said,\r\n“The state, it is I”; well, imagine the scoffing you would have met\r\nwith, if you had talked with some haughty marquis of that court, and\r\ntried to tell him how some day in France the common “riff-raff” would\r\nhave votes, and choose parliaments, and decide the issues of war and\r\ndiplomacy. He would have been quite sure they could never do it; and as\r\na matter of fact, they don’t, Judd--but they will; yes, even here in\r\nthe United States the people will some day decide!\r\n\r\nToday our great captains of industry are no less certain that common\r\nworkingmen cannot possibly have intelligence enough to run factories,\r\nto say nothing of deciding the broad policies of business. The masters\r\nhave won the money fight, and got the power, and they mean to hold on\r\nto it, and train their descendants and found great money-dynasties.\r\nBut the same thing happens that we saw two hundred years ago with the\r\nFrench kings--the new generations become enervated and worthless,\r\nand the wealth of the community flows into the lap of idlers and\r\nparasites, who squander it in dissipation and display; the poor become\r\ndiscontented and rebellious, and the rumble of the approaching deluge\r\nis heard.\r\n\r\nOur capitalist newspapers never get tired of harping upon the failures\r\nof government ownership, the waste and the graft. Private ownership\r\nis the way to efficiency! Well, Judd, there is a lot of present-day\r\nefficiency which I am ready to do without, beginning from this very\r\nhour. For example, efficiency in maiming and killing workers--which\r\ncaused one million in our country to be disabled in 1925! Labor today\r\nworks under the lash of the slave-driver, and I am willing to see\r\nindustry slow down, so that workingmen may be human beings. And then, I\r\nexamine the graft under public ownership, and what do I find? Private\r\nowners seeking private profits out of government! Here is a slogan,\r\nJudd:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The cause of graft is not public ownership of industry, but\r\n     private ownership of politicians!_\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can we stop that? We have tried the plan of sending the grafters\r\nto jail, but that doesn’t work, for the reason that the grafters buy\r\nthe prosecuting officials and the judges; in the few cases where we get\r\nthem into jail, they buy the jailers. So I suggest a new plan--that we\r\ntake away the motive to graft, by making it impossible for any man to\r\nexploit the labor of his fellows, or to monopolize those things which\r\nare necessary to the life of all.\r\n\r\nLearning industrial democracy is like learning to swim. You stick one\r\nfoot into the water, and you see that it sinks, and so you draw it out\r\nin a hurry, and decide, it is impossible for you to stay on top of the\r\nwater. And then along comes a man who says: “Yes, you can swim, but not\r\nuntil you go all the way in.” It seems an absurdity at first, yet it is\r\nthe literal truth about government ownership; you can own and run it\r\nall, but you can’t own and run a small part!\r\n\r\nAt present private ownership is making all the big profits, and so,\r\nof course, it is paying all the big salaries, and getting most of the\r\ncompetent men. Not content with that, it is undermining the competition\r\nof government, using its huge resources to buy the political parties,\r\nand nominate incompetent men to public office. That is no wild\r\nstatement, but a fact of big business policy. Our masters, who control\r\nthe political parties, are afraid to have competent men in public\r\noffice, for fear they might take up a notion to do something real for\r\nthe public welfare. They prefer a man who can’t kick over the traces,\r\nbecause he is too feeble. That is why at the last nominating convention\r\nthey turned down a really competent and loyal servant of theirs, Mr.\r\nHerbert Hoover, and gave us poor, shy, pitiful Mr. Coolidge, who can\r\nnever by any possibility do anything, for the reason that he doesn’t\r\nknow what to do.\r\n\r\nWhen you and I, Judd, and the rest of the useful workers of America,\r\nget ready to run our own business, we can do it. We shall do it, if\r\nfor no other reason, because we have to--because we need food in our\r\ncities, and machinery on our farms. We shall hire the best experts\r\nto run our industries; and many of them will be the very men who are\r\nrunning them now--they will be just as well content to work for the\r\nAmerican people as for Johnny Coaloil, who is now taking a yachting\r\ntrip with a dozen chorus girls on the Riviera, or for Mrs. Silly\r\nSplash, who is setting the new fashion in diamond-embroidered bathing\r\nsuits at Palm Beach. Yes, Judd, we shall find ways to run our business\r\nwithout these elegant idlers; and whatever waste there may be won’t be\r\nso bad as having them corrupt a whole generation of our young people\r\nby their vicious folly. If there is graft, we’ll find ways to stop it,\r\nand if more efficiency is needed, we’ll get it--because it will be our\r\nbusiness, and our loss if we fail.\r\n\r\nI’ll go even further, Judd; I’ll assert that the amount of waste\r\ninherent in capitalism is so frightful, that no amount of inefficiency\r\nunder a free system can approach it. Remember the “iron ring,” and what\r\nit will mean to us to get into the factories, with the right to run\r\nthem for ourselves! Remember our figures on the wastes of competition!\r\nLet us have a “slogan,” for you to paste in your hat and learn, Judd:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _To compare the productive powers of a free system with those of\r\n     capitalism, is to compare a normal human being with a vicious\r\n     maniac._\r\n\r\n\r\nJust a sentence or two, Judd, to remind us what this maniac has done:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Capitalism, between 1914 and 1918, deliberately destroyed\r\n     30,000,000 human lives, and $300,000,000,000 worth of property!_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again, Judd:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Capitalism in the United States keeps an average of five million\r\n     men out of work all the time!_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again, Judd:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Capitalism in Europe last summer had nine million men working\r\n     hard at learning to destroy the wealth which the rest of the\r\n     workers were creating!_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then paste this sentence in your hat, Judd:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _While our population increased 200 per cent in the past 50 years,\r\n     capitalism increased our expenditures for mass-slaughter more than\r\n     2400 per cent!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nWe are going to take over the industrial plant of the United States,\r\nand run it as one planned enterprise for the benefit of the whole\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nJust what do we mean to take? Roughly speaking, all railroads,\r\ntelegraphs and telephones, all banks, the mines and large factories,\r\nthe large oil fields with pipe-lines and refineries, the large\r\npacking and canning plants, the large warehouses and stores, and what\r\noffice buildings are necessary for these enterprises. We do not want\r\nthe homes, nor the personal property, nor the automobiles, nor the\r\nlivestock; nor, if I have my way, shall we want farms. Some old-time\r\nSocialists will contest this, but the new generation will agree, I\r\nthink. The reason is interesting, and it may help to clear up the whole\r\nmatter if we begin by considering the problem of the land.\r\n\r\nKarl Marx thought that the farms would go the same way as the\r\nfactories; that is, they would get bigger and bigger, under capitalist\r\nownership. He failed to allow for the essential factor--that no\r\ncapitalist can work his employes so hard as the small farmer works his\r\nwomen and children. So the small farmer has stayed on his small farm;\r\na free man--except that every year he is deeper in debt to the banker,\r\nand in a larger percentage each year he loses the ownership, and is\r\nmerely a tenant, supporting an absentee landlord. The modern Socialist,\r\nrecognizing that situation, does not propose to walk into the trap, but\r\nseeks a different solution of the land problem.\r\n\r\nThe single taxer comes, urging us to take the burden of taxes off\r\nimprovements, which are made by human labor, and put it on the land,\r\nwhich is the gift of Nature. He points to the rise of land values in\r\ncities, the so-called “unearned increment”; values go up, because\r\npeople crowd into the city, and private owners get a colossal increase,\r\nwhich they have done nothing whatever to earn; their gains make a\r\nheavy burden on production, which the whole community must pay. That\r\nsounded reasonable, and so for a while I was a single taxer; you’ll be\r\ninterested to know, Judd, that the reason I gave it up was you!\r\n\r\nWe had a big single tax campaign here in California in 1916, and I\r\nput in some hard work at it; among other things I spent a day arguing\r\nwith my friend Judd. We were sitting on the roof of the garage, laying\r\nshingles, and all the time I tried to make you “see” the single tax.\r\nBut you had read in the Los Angeles “Times” that it would increase\r\nthe taxes on your two lots, and that had made you mad; also, you had\r\nread that it would take the taxes off the rich man’s bonds, and off\r\nhis wife’s jewels, and that had made you madder. I tried to get you to\r\nsee the absurdity of believing that the “Times” could be interested in\r\nkeeping any taxes on the rich; I tried to show the actual reason, that\r\nthe tax collector couldn’t find the rich man’s bonds, nor his wife’s\r\njewels. But you didn’t get it, Judd, and when I saw the votes of all\r\nthe other Judds in that election, I decided that the single tax is a\r\ntactical blunder. Never again will I be caught proposing to take any\r\ntaxes off the rich; from that day forth I have been a multiple taxer--I\r\nwant to put just as many kinds of taxes on the rich as the imagination\r\ncan invent.\r\n\r\nJoking aside, Judd, I changed my whole strategy as result of that day\r\non the roof with you. For twelve or thirteen years I had been expecting\r\nto see Socialism brought about by some sort of tax on wealth; but you\r\nmade me realize how passionately every human creature hates taxes.\r\nCould one not find some easier way? I realized that all men like money,\r\nthe more the merrier; and then came the war, and I saw our government\r\nmaking money by the billions, just by acts of Congress and the waving\r\nof a presidential pen. Then came the panic, and I saw our wonderful\r\nFederal Reserve System making more billions for the use of the big\r\nbankers and the trusts; so a great light dawned upon me, a heavenly\r\nlight! I see now, Judd, that we shall forget taxes altogether, and take\r\na leaf out of Wall Street’s new book; we shall make as many billions of\r\nnew money as the emergency requires, and instead of having Wall Street\r\nput that new money off on us, we shall put it off on Wall Street!\r\n\r\nI know some young workers in our country who call themselves social\r\nrevolutionists, and are impatient when they hear me talk about\r\ncompensation for the capitalists. These young people feel ugly towards\r\nthe capitalists, and for this I do not blame them, seeing how they\r\nhave been treated. But the point of my criticism is that these young\r\nenthusiasts want to be ugly to the capitalists in an old-fashioned, out\r\nof date way, with guns and barricades, while I want to be ugly in the\r\nmodern way of high finance.\r\n\r\nWhat is it we really want? Is it to kill the capitalists? No, but\r\nmerely to take from them their power to exploit labor. And how do\r\nthey get this power? By guns and barricades? They hold it that way,\r\nof course; but inside each modern country they have devised the new\r\nand infinitely more effective scheme of financial manipulation, the\r\ncreation of imaginary money with which to buy everything in sight.\r\nAnd it is this weapon I want to turn against them. Why, for heaven’s\r\nsake, do we want to have insurrections and riots, when by means of this\r\nmodern Aladdin’s magic we can walk peaceably into every factory and\r\ntake charge? The capitalists have created the magic lamp for us--this\r\nwonderful new Federal Reserve System; all we have to do is to turn\r\nout the present board of bankers’ bankers, and put in a new board of\r\nworkers’ bankers, and create a hundred billion dollars of new money,\r\nand pay for the industries, and there you are! Not a court in the land\r\ncan stop us, and if any capitalist tries to, he is a revolutionist, and\r\nwe have criminal syndicalism laws for him!\r\n\r\nThis is “inflation,” we are told; and inflation raises the cost of\r\ngoods, and so brings no benefit to the worker. Yes, Judd, but get the\r\npoint clear--inflation is one thing if you use it to buy goods, and\r\nquite a different thing if you use it to buy factories. In buying\r\ngoods, you buy on a rising market, but in buying factories you buy at a\r\nfixed price, and so it is the owners who suffer the loss. And that is\r\nthe beauty of this scheme I am unfolding; these Wall Street gentry have\r\n“passed the buck” to us--and we pass it right back!\r\n\r\nThe Russian revolutionists made a grave mistake in their dealings with\r\nworld capitalism; they were too honest. They repudiated the debts of\r\nthe Tsar’s government--declaring that the money had been spent to\r\nenslave the Russian workers, and they would never repay it. Therefore\r\nworld capitalism went to war with Russia, and is still at war, and\r\nthat error in tactics has cost the new government many times the\r\ndebts of the old regime. But how much more clever were the capitalist\r\ngovernments of Italy and France! They also owed us money; but they\r\nwere so polite--they are the politest people in the world! They owed\r\nit, of course, and they would pay, of course; never would they dream\r\nof failing to pay their debts; but just now they were very poor, and\r\ncouldn’t pay, and wouldn’t we please lend them another hundred million\r\nor so? We loaned it--because if they go bankrupt they will also go\r\nBolshevik, and that scares the gizzard out of our bankers. So these\r\nsmooth capitalist nations have never paid us a dollar, but their\r\ncredit is still good, and we never think of them as criminals and\r\nmurderers--oh, nothing like that, it is all between gentlemen in Wall\r\nStreet, and the worthless bonds have been worked off on the general\r\npublic, and all is serene!\r\n\r\nSo, Judd, I say, let us be gentlemen, too, and pay! Pay any price the\r\ncapitalists ask--anything to get them out of the factories, and get\r\nthe workers in! It will mean that we support a horde of parasites for\r\nawhile; but we are doing that, anyhow, and can do it better then,\r\nbecause we shall double production. Young Johnny Coaloil will still be\r\nable to keep his yacht and his chorus girls on the Riviera, and Mrs.\r\nSilly Splash will continue to wear diamond-embroidered bathing suits at\r\nPalm Beach; but notice the difference, Judd--from now on they can buy\r\nnothing but goods with their money, they can no longer buy the means of\r\nproduction, and so they will not be able to increase their income!\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, we can proceed at once to cut it down, by means of\r\nan inheritance tax. We already have such a tax--the Coolidge crowd is\r\ntrying to get rid of it at this moment, and likewise the publicity\r\nclause of the income tax, which exposes the big exploiters to\r\nuncomfortable daylight! But we can put it back, Judd; we can make the\r\nprovisions that gifts in anticipation of death count as inheritance;\r\nwe can register the owners of the bonds, and so wipe out that whole\r\nmass of privilege in a generation or two. I promised to show you how\r\nthe useful workers of America can take possession of their industrial\r\nplant, and here is the way. Nothing prevents them but lack of\r\nknowledge; and that is why I am writing these letters!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nWe have been discussing the problem of how the workers are to get\r\npossession of the industrial machinery of the country. I have proposed\r\nto pay for it; but there are some who insist that the workers should\r\nseize the plant. It has been built by the workers, and taken from\r\nthem by fraud; if we purchase it, we merely continue exploitation\r\nunder another form; the government replaces the owners as task-master,\r\nand collects the profits and pays them to the owners in the form of\r\ndividends.\r\n\r\nThis statement sounds all right, but it overlooks the essential factor\r\nin our business situation--that “iron ring” I have been telling you\r\nabout. At the present time not one per cent of our factories are\r\nrun at full capacity all the year round; but when we get possession\r\nfor the workers, we break the iron ring, and can run them all day\r\nand all night. We have five million unemployed--the average of good\r\nyears and bad, you remember--five million men to go to work, to turn\r\nout more goods for themselves and for all. We cut out the wastes and\r\nreduplication; and according to the lowest estimate, we double our\r\nproduction of goods.\r\n\r\nThe plant we propose to buy is worth, roughly, one hundred billion\r\ndollars, and its annual product is twenty billions, possibly thirty;\r\nlet us say twenty, to be safe. We pay for it with five per cent bonds,\r\nwhich means the former owners get five billions a year. If we double\r\nproduction, we have forty billions a year, which leaves thirty-five\r\nbillions for us. In other words, Judd:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _We can work half an hour a day for the owners, and four hours a\r\n     day for ourselves, and be twice as rich as at present._\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you see why I am in favor of compensation! Not because I love the\r\nowners, but because, as a matter of cold cash, we shall do better that\r\nway. I will go so far as to argue that if we try to pay nothing, we\r\nshall really pay more. If we try to kick the bosses out, and seize the\r\nfactories, and run them by workers’ councils--obviously, that may mean\r\ncivil war. The bosses have the factories, and they have machine-guns\r\nand airplanes and poison gas--a system for wiping out the lives of\r\nthousands of workers, if necessary. One of the embarrassments of\r\nphysical force revolution is that it may fail, and the workers, instead\r\nof getting the factories, may get castor oil and Fascist clubs. There\r\nis a big group of our masters who think that is what the workers need,\r\nand would take delight in administering it.\r\n\r\nI know some young revolutionists who are prepared to die for the\r\nproletariat, in a fine spirit of martyrdom. They are impatient of talk\r\nabout money, but I beg them to pause and consider the balance sheet of\r\nCompensation versus Confiscation. Even though they succeed in their\r\nrevolution, they surely cannot do it without industrial waste. They\r\nwill have to stop the machines while they are fighting; they may shoot\r\nholes in the factories, and even burn some of them down. And just what\r\nwill that cost? We are reckoning, you understand, on our possible\r\ndouble production--forty billions a year. The interest we pay the\r\nowners is five billions a year. So now:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _If in the course of our revolution we destroy one-eighth of our\r\n     industrial plant, it would have been cheaper to pay the owners for\r\n     the whole thing._\r\n\r\n\r\nOr, suppose we have the good luck to get by without much fighting--what\r\nthen? Well, the present management, which knows the industry, and is\r\nkeeping the plant going--this management is hired by the owners, and\r\nis loyal to the owners, and will have to be booted out the back door,\r\nwhich will certainly stop production, cripple it for months, perhaps\r\nyears. But if our government comes to the owners in a business deal,\r\nand buys the plant, the management will stay on, as it did when we\r\ntook over the railroads during the war. On that basis, we shall not\r\nlose an hour of the plant’s time, nor will the workers lose an hour\r\nof their wages. And how does this figure up, in the balance sheet of\r\nCompensation versus Confiscation? Listen:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _If our industrial plant is idle for six weeks, we have lost what\r\n     would have paid the owners for a year._\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again, an obvious consequence:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Every day over six weeks that the plant is idle, the workers are\r\n     paying from their own pockets!_\r\n\r\n\r\nOur young revolutionists are going by the Russian model, and that is\r\nnatural, because many of them come from there. But Russia had a small\r\nindustrial plant, and we have a great one, enormously complicated.\r\nMoreover, Russia had no middle class, while we have a powerful one,\r\nready to turn out at a moment’s notice and use machine guns and poison\r\ngas in the interest of property rights. The workers’ revolution\r\nsucceeded in Russia, because the country was broken by war; but to\r\nbring us to a similar state of disorganization would take decades of\r\nsuffering and waste--I venture the guess that it would be twenty times\r\ncheaper to buy the capitalists out, than to bring America to the point\r\nwhere a physical force revolution could prevail.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, having said all that, fairness compels me to admit another\r\nside. I have been setting forth the ideal procedure; but this is not an\r\nideal world, and many times we have to take what we can get, instead of\r\nwhat we want. Having told you my hopes, I will now tell you my fears.\r\n\r\nThe masses of our country are ignorant and unorganized. More than half\r\nof them do not vote at all; a large percentage value their votes at\r\ntwo dollars each, and the rest take their party as they take their\r\nGod--from their grandfathers. They are interested in baseball and\r\nprize fighting, and jazz, and the doings of the “smart set”; they do\r\nnot know how to think, and they never read anything but the “kept”\r\nnewspapers and magazines, which tell them they are the greatest people\r\nin the world. Never in history has there been so elaborate a system\r\nfor the hoodwinking of a hundred million people; and they lap up the\r\npropaganda, and go to the polls and vote their government into a\r\nbranch-office of J. P. Morgan and Company.\r\n\r\nBut all this does not stop the process of industrial evolution; rather\r\nit speeds it up--giving the rich more money to produce more goods, and\r\ncausing the poor to have less money to buy the goods. So the crisis\r\ncomes on like a cyclone; and we shall find ourselves with our factories\r\nidle and millions of people starving, and no idea of the next step\r\nto take. There will be no time to teach the masses, no machinery for\r\nreaching them; but the desperate workers in our cities will hear the\r\nvoice of the Communist soap-boxer, saying, “Take the factories, and\r\nproduce goods for yourselves and your fellows.” The soap-boxer will\r\nask: “Do you have to starve, because the majority has not voted you\r\nfood?” He will ask: “Does a man have to remain a slave because the\r\nmajority has not voted him free?” So it may happen that the hungry\r\nworkers seize the factories and attempt to run them; and we shall have\r\nto make the best of it and help them to success.\r\n\r\nIn such an emergency, the social changes will be sudden and drastic;\r\nand that is the reason why I do not attempt to foretell what the new\r\nindustrial forms will be. Just how the business will be managed depends\r\nin great part upon those who now have the power in their hands; they\r\nmay choose either to be stubborn and brutal, or to display vision and\r\na sense of justice, not to say of common prudence. You can see the\r\ndifference this makes if you compare the great French revolution of\r\na century and a half ago with the series of changes that have taken\r\nplace in England during the same period. England has become a partly\r\ndemocratic country in fact, while remaining a monarchy in form; the\r\nreason being that the governing classes never pushed the people to the\r\nlast extreme, but made concessions, just enough to keep themselves in\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThere is room for a variety of compromises between the workers and\r\nthe capitalists, and also between the workers and the state. The\r\ncapitalists may permit the setting up of shop committees, with\r\nthe right of control over working conditions; they may consent to\r\nrepresentation of the workers in boards which oversee each industry,\r\nwith power to make adjustments and enforce decrees. Or both sides may\r\nprefer to call upon the government to do the adjusting. Or again, the\r\nworkers may get control of the government, and laws may be passed\r\nproviding for the taking over of control by the trade unions. A\r\npractical program has been worked out by the railway brotherhoods, the\r\nPlumb plan; providing for the purchase of the roads by the government,\r\nand their operation by a board representing the government, the\r\nbrotherhoods, and the bondholders until the latter have been paid off.\r\nThe day may come when the money-masters of this country will wish they\r\nhad had the statesmanship to put that plan into operation while there\r\nwas time.\r\n\r\nI have argued here for government ownership of industry; but you must\r\nunderstand--that is not the same thing as operation of industry by\r\npoliticians. The people who understand an industry are those who work\r\nin it; and the way to combine democracy with efficiency is to make each\r\nindustry a self-governing unit, and confine the part of government to\r\nsupervision, and the regulation of prices. Let us have an industrial\r\nconstitution and an industrial parliament, and let every man become\r\na citizen of industry, with a voice in the control, and equal rights\r\nwith all other citizens. That is the goal we work towards, and it is a\r\nstrictly American goal, in line with American traditions. The practical\r\nsteps are, first, to organize the workers in each industry, and make\r\nthem class conscious, awake to their own interests; and second, to use\r\nthe power of the state to open the books of each industry and expose\r\nthe profits, cutting down the share which goes to the idle owners, and\r\nincreasing the share which goes to the useful workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nThe social revolution has already happened over one-sixth of the\r\nearth’s surface, and 140,000,000 people are now living in a working\r\nclass world. Whatever may be our point of view, we cannot afford to\r\nmisunderstand what has happened in Russia, for capitalism has made the\r\nworld one, and our efforts to shut ourselves up in our own country are\r\nbound to fail.\r\n\r\nThe Russian revolution came as the result of a breakdown in the\r\nmidst of war. The great empire was rotten with graft, and after three\r\nyears of fighting, had got to a state where it could no longer keep\r\nits railways going, or feed the people in its cities. With starvation\r\nactually upon them, the soldiers, sailors and workers formed unions,\r\nand in October, 1917, they overthrew the government of the Tsar, and\r\nformed a new government--and gave world capitalism the most painful\r\nshock of its career.\r\n\r\nThere have been slave revolts all through history, but always blind\r\nand futile, put down with hideous slaughter. But here in the Russian\r\nrevolution appeared a new thing; the control was seized by a group\r\nof men who had been trained in Western ideas, and had a theory of\r\nrevolutions, and of working-class mastery of society. These men knew\r\nwhat they wanted, and they tried their plan, and it worked--at least\r\nto the extent that they are still in power, in spite of two years of\r\nwar waged upon them by the whole capitalist world, and six more years\r\nof financial blockade, plus the greatest campaign of falsehood in all\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nWho were these men? They call themselves Marxians, and apply the\r\nadjective “scientific” to themselves, because they think they have\r\nstudied the capitalist system--the laws of its growth and decay, the\r\nforces which are destined to overthrow it, and the kind of society\r\nthese new forces will establish. History, says Marx, is a series of\r\nclass struggles, and the end is the victory of the working class, and\r\nthe beginning of a society in which there are no classes, for the\r\nreason that nobody lives by exploiting anybody else. “Workers of all\r\ncountries, unite,” runs the slogan. “You have nothing to lose but your\r\nchains; you have a world to gain.”\r\n\r\nThe Marxian theory is, in brief, that the development of large-scale\r\ncapitalism brings the workers into factories, where they toil for the\r\nbenefit of absentee owners whom they never see; it subjects them to low\r\nwages, long hours and uncertainty of employment, and forces them to\r\norganize and fight for better conditions. In this fight they develop\r\n“class consciousness,” and in the end they are forced by capitalist\r\nbreakdown to revolt, and take possession of the factories, and run them\r\nfor the benefit of the workers and not of the masters.\r\n\r\nThey had a chance to try it in Russia, and they did so; the question\r\nof what they have accomplished is the most fiercely debated of all\r\nquestions today. To help us get it straight, understand first, that\r\nthey had to do what they did. In other countries--America, England,\r\nFrance, Germany, Austria--the middle class took charge of the\r\nrevolutions; but in Russia there was practically no middle class, it\r\nwas the workers or chaos. And second, they took over a busted machine,\r\na country in collapse after three years of modern war, the most\r\ndestructive of all things known this side of hell. And third, they had\r\nto face years of invasion from Europe, America and Japan, fighting on\r\n26 fronts at once; and at the same time civil war, and a blockade, and\r\nfinancial boycott, and world propaganda, besides two successive years\r\nof famine, something which comes every so often in Russia--caused by\r\ndrought, and not by revolutions.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this, Soviet Russia confronts its world of enemies,\r\neight years young, and proud and confident. It has restored its\r\nagriculture to the pre-war standard, and its industry to nearly 80 per\r\ncent of this standard, with the certainty of passing it in 1926 or 1927\r\nif peace is maintained. It has turned one-sixth of the earth’s surface\r\nfrom a militarist empire into a federated group of commonwealths,\r\ngoverned under a new system, in which the voters are classified\r\naccording to their occupations. It has trained a new generation of\r\nyoung workers, and taken some five hundred thousand of them into its\r\ngoverning party. It has taught millions of men and women to read and\r\nwrite, including everybody in its army, and nearly everybody in its\r\nindustries. It would seem that all this entitles the new system to\r\nstudy, and to fair play in the field of thought.\r\n\r\nBut Russia is not democratic; so they tell you, Judd--and you are\r\nstrong for democracy. Well, I also share that faith; but if, as time\r\ngoes on, the workers of the world discover that democracy means\r\ninequality such as we have here in America, while the “dictatorship of\r\nthe proletariat” means cultural freedom for the workers and a swiftly\r\nspreading plenty for all--well, Judd, we advocates of democracy will\r\nhave a hard time in debates! But the truth is that we have in America\r\npolitical democracy alongside industrial autocracy; and these two are\r\nmaking a war upon each other, and we shall have to choose whether our\r\ncountry is to become a capitalist empire or an industrial republic.\r\n\r\nRussia has never had democracy, nor even the ideal of it, except among\r\na few dreamers. Less than seventy-five years ago its farm population\r\nwere all serfs, bound to the soil. Many of its outlying peoples are\r\nsemi-barbarous tribes. Its factories are few and at the time of the\r\nworld war they were financed by foreign capital, and run by foreigners.\r\nThere came this devastating war, and then a breakdown; and to expect\r\nthose who took control to set up at once such a democratic system as we\r\nknow in America, is to be absurd. Many who talk about it are dishonest,\r\nfor they know that if their own parties get control, they will hold it\r\nby exactly the same means as the Bolsheviks--that is, by force.\r\n\r\nWhat the Bolsheviks are doing is to educate the workers and peasants,\r\nand then take them into the governing party. The purpose of that party\r\nis to hold power until all the workers have come into it, and the\r\n“Union of Socialist Soviet Republics” includes the whole population of\r\nthe former empire of the Tsar. In fact, they expect to include a lot\r\nmore, because they think the workers of some other countries are going\r\nto join them; and the rulers and capitalists of those countries fear\r\nthe same thing--which is the reason they hate the Bolsheviks, and carry\r\non such deadly lying about them.\r\n\r\nThe British Tories, backed by American bankers, are now conducting\r\na world-wide intrigue against Russia; and soon they may be calling\r\nthe American people to join in a new war “to make the world safe for\r\ndemocracy.” And what then? The chances are that the American people\r\nwill join in, for they dearly love everything that is upper-class\r\nBritish, and enjoy nothing so much as crushing labor anywhere in the\r\nworld. They elected Coolidge in a fervor of patriotism because they\r\nthought--mistakenly--that he had had something to do with smashing\r\nthe Boston police strike. As I write, our government is donating a\r\nbillion dollars--in the form of a pretended “debt settlement”--to the\r\nItalian government, because Judge Gary and our other masters so love\r\nthese black-shirt Fascisti, and look forward to the time when they can\r\nadminister the castor-oil treatment to American labor.\r\n\r\nYes, Judd; and we simply ladled out our money to the Tsarist\r\nadventurers, to every nation and tribe of reactionary that was fighting\r\nSoviet Russia on twenty-six fronts; we dressed up Polish troops in\r\nAmerican uniforms to make war on Russia, and even burned American Red\r\nCross supplies to keep them from being captured and used for the sick\r\nand starving people of the Soviet republic. We allowed Woodrow Wilson\r\nto send our boys to their death in his private war on a friendly\r\npeople--under the command of British officers in Archangel, and helping\r\nthe Japanese to take Siberia.\r\n\r\nAll that was done, Judd, and done with your money, and under the flag\r\nof your country; and it will be done again when the British Tories are\r\nready--for the bull-dog never sleeps, and he never lets go his hold. He\r\nhas set out to strangle the Soviets, as once he strangled Napoleon--and\r\nfor the same reason, to keep his grip on the 300,000,000 serfs of\r\nIndia. If, when the next attack begins, America does not hasten to\r\npour out its blood and treasure, it will be for one reason and one\r\nonly; because in the meantime it has been possible to reach the plain\r\npeople like yourself, and make them understand, and hold back the world\r\nbankers from their next World Crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nOur country today is traveling headlong the road which has led every\r\ngreat empire in history to its doom. And this is no piece of rhetoric,\r\nbut a summary of statistics to be found in our census reports.\r\nWhat ruined Rome was the spread of capitalist imperialism with its\r\nconsequences--the undermining of the independent farmers, the growth\r\nof tenantry and absentee landlordism, and the turning of the country\r\npopulation into city slum-dwellers, uncertain of their employment and\r\ndependent upon public doles.\r\n\r\nAnd every one of these things is happening right before our eyes. The\r\nprice of farm-land is going up, steadily and inexorably; the profits\r\nof agriculture are going to middlemen, speculators, and moneylenders.\r\nFarm mortgages are increasing, farm tenantry is increasing, decade\r\nafter decade, with the certainty of a doom. The young men are leaving\r\nthe farms and going to the city, to increase unemployment and bring\r\ndown wages. The man who wants a city home pays a constantly increasing\r\ntribute to land speculators; while in the business districts land\r\nvalues double or treble in a decade, and no work can go on until the\r\nlandlord’s greed has been appeased.\r\n\r\nMillions of little fellows like yourself, Judd, support that system,\r\nbecause you own a lot or two, and are making a little profit; just as\r\nmillions support the big trusts, because they own a share or two of\r\nstock. They do not see that under a just system they, as producers,\r\nwould get many times what they get as petty speculators. Our first\r\ntask is to show them, and bring them to our side. We wish to take the\r\ngovernment out of the hands of the capitalist and landlord class; and\r\nthen to apply the remedy for land speculation, a tax on land values,\r\nfalling heavily on rented land, and still more heavily on land not used\r\nat all. This will set free the soil, and wipe out the gamblers; there\r\nwill be plenty of farm-land open for use, and lots near the cities\r\nwill be cheap. At the same time both cities and states will have money\r\nfor public improvements, bringing high wages, and benefit to all. The\r\nfarmer will have abundant markets, because the city population will no\r\nlonger be on half rations. The land values tax is the only just one,\r\nbecause it taxes the wealth created by nature, and not by human labor;\r\nalso, it is the only tax which can be fully collected--all others are\r\ntaxes on honesty, and we need that commodity badly, and should not tax\r\nit out of existence.\r\n\r\nThere is a form of conflict between farmers and organized workers,\r\nbecause the farmer has to hire labor, and wants it cheap. This conflict\r\nis carefully made use of by the old party politicians, who wish to\r\nplunder the two groups separately. I point out to both farmer and\r\nworkingman that their deeper interests are identical; they are the\r\nproducers, and supplement each other. The farmers grow food for the\r\ncity workers, while the city workers make building materials and\r\nmachinery, clothing, newspapers--everything the farmers need. These two\r\ngroups form the basis of the new society, and in their political union\r\nlies our hope for the future.\r\n\r\nWhen I say “workers,” understand that I mean workers of both hand and\r\nbrain: housewives and teachers, clerks and stenographers, architects,\r\nchemists and doctors, foremen, superintendents and executives--all who\r\nare actually necessary to the efficient production of wealth. The only\r\nones not necessary are the owners, in their capacity as exploiters and\r\nparasites.\r\n\r\nI know that many owners also work as managers, and if they are\r\ncompetent, I respect them, and invite their aid. I should be glad to\r\nsee young Rockefeller managing our national oil trust--provided only\r\nthat somebody would convert him to the ideal of public service. When\r\nthe real crisis comes, some employers will realize that the making\r\nof industrial democracy is a task worthy of all the energy they are\r\nnow putting into making millions of dollars--to be used later on in\r\nwrecking the lives of their descendants.\r\n\r\nThe useful workers of industry, and those on the land, must get\r\ntogether. They must have a political party of producers--the plan has\r\nbeen fully worked out in Minnesota, and the other states have only to\r\nfollow. Also we must build up and strengthen the trade unions of both\r\nworkers and farmers; for it is not at all certain that the masters of\r\nmoney will surrender to white paper ballots in whatever number; they\r\nmust know that these ballots are backed by nationwide organizations,\r\ncapable, determined, and wielding the threat of the mass-strike.\r\n\r\nAs part of the process of organizing and drawing together farmers\r\nand workers, we must encourage business co-operation between these\r\ngroups. The farmers can feed the workers, and the workers can set\r\nup co-operative factories for their farmer customers. The railway\r\nbrotherhoods have made a beginning at this, and so have the clothing\r\nworkers. Equally important is labor-banking, to finance such\r\nundertakings. At present a great deal of labor-banking turns out to\r\nbe shadow--there is no real control by labor, and all that happens\r\nis, some former labor officials become successful bankers. But that\r\nalso will be remedied--the unions will have banks which they actually\r\ncontrol, and whose funds they use for their own enterprises. What\r\ncould be more pitiful than the present situation--the workers putting\r\ntheir billions of savings into capitalist banks, to be shipped on to\r\nWall Street and there used for robbing labor, and financing anti-labor\r\nnewspapers--and even breaking labor strikes!\r\n\r\nAt the present time the policies of American labor both political and\r\nindustrial, are a generation out of date; our workingmen are like the\r\nMoros in the Philippines, fighting machine-guns with bows and arrows.\r\nThe unions are still organized according to crafts; and they face\r\ngigantic combinations of capital, which have merged a hundred different\r\ncrafts into one. So of course the unions are beaten or outwitted at\r\nevery turn; and membership falls off, and the old officials whistle to\r\nkeep their courage up.\r\n\r\nI remember, Judd, that in some of our arguing you asserted that many\r\nlabor leaders are corrupt; that is one reason why you are not a union\r\nman. But go and investigate trade union corruption, and you find just\r\nwhat we found about political corruption. Who puts up the money to\r\nbuy labor leaders? The employers, and the employers’ associations!\r\nWherever you touch this evil in our society, it is one and the same\r\nthing--private wealth seeking to increase itself at the expense of the\r\npoor and weak. In Chicago I once investigated a strike of teamsters,\r\nwhich had kept the city in an uproar for weeks, and cost several\r\nlives--to say nothing of discrediting the workers. And what was behind\r\nit? A great mail-order house trying to put another mail-order house out\r\nof business, hiring a strike and gangs of sluggers!\r\n\r\nThe remedy for that is not to desert the unions, but to put new blood\r\ninto them, a new policy and a new ideal. The task of labor is no longer\r\nto get five cents more per hour for its members, or an extra hour\r\noff on Saturdays; it is to reconstruct society, and make a world of\r\nproducers, managed by producers, for the benefit of producers. And for\r\nthat every worker is needed, and the place where he is needed is in\r\nthe union with his fellows. If there are officials without vision, go\r\nin and teach them; point out how the employers have formed trusts, and\r\nhow the workers must match them with great industrial unions. If labor\r\nofficials are dishonest and betrayers of their cause, kick them out,\r\nand find others who are class conscious and loyal. I know that is easy\r\nto say and hard to do; yet surely, Judd, labor cannot lie down and give\r\nup! Get it straight--this is a changing world, and you can’t stay as\r\nyou are; there are forces at work that will beat the workers back into\r\ntheir age-old status of serfs, unless they have the courage and brain\r\npower to master these forces, and lift themselves to the new status of\r\ncitizens of industry. Join, and do your part; and some day the law will\r\nprovide that every man who works at a trade becomes automatically a\r\nmember of his union, an equal citizen of the industry, with no power to\r\nexploit others, nor fear of being exploited by others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDD:\r\n\r\nWe have come to the end of our task. I have tried to show you what is\r\ngoing on in our country, and the job you have to do.\r\n\r\nWe are moving towards a new American revolution. That does not mean\r\nriot and tumult, as our enemies try to represent; but neither does it\r\nmean slavish submission to every repression of government. There is\r\nthe best American precedent for resistance to tyranny, and those good\r\nladies who call themselves “Daughters of the American Revolution” would\r\nbe shocked speechless if I were to quote to them the authentic words of\r\nSam Adams and Patrick Henry and George Washington and Thomas Jefferson\r\non the right of the people to overthrow unjust governments. Said\r\nAbraham Lincoln, in his first inaugural address: “This country, with\r\nits institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they\r\nshall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise their\r\nconstitutional right of amending it, or their revolutionary right to\r\ndismember or overthrow it.” There can be no question that those words\r\ncome precisely under the specifications of the California “criminal\r\nsyndicalism” law, and a man who said them today would be sent up for\r\nfourteen years, to cough out his lungs in the jute-mill of San Quentin\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nWe have to get rid of the capitalist system. It is close to breaking\r\ndown, and will soon be unable to run the factories it has built, or\r\nto bring food to the people in its giant cities. We have got to stop\r\nproducing goods for profit, and learn to produce them for the use of\r\nthose who work. I have pointed out the way to make that change under\r\nour Constitution. I say: if there is violence, let the capitalists\r\nstart it--and then you, Judd, and the rest of the workers, can finish\r\nit!\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln hated the slave power, just as I hate the capitalist\r\npower; but he moved carefully, keeping the mass of the people with\r\nhim, and pushed the slave power against the wall, until presently\r\nit revolted and began the fighting; then Lincoln called for seventy\r\nthousand men to put down the rebellion, and presently he called for a\r\nmillion, and before he got through he had freed the slaves, and put\r\nan end to that evil forever. And maybe that is going to happen again;\r\nmaybe when we get seriously to work, the capitalists are going to\r\norganize their armed bands of rowdies, as they did in Italy, and as\r\nthey are now doing in France and Germany and England, and set out to\r\nthwart the people’s will as expressed at the polls. If that happens,\r\nJudd, let us have the traditions of America, and the moral forces of\r\nAmerica, on our side.\r\n\r\nI am one who believes in those traditions; coming, as I do, of a\r\nline of naval ancestors. My great-grandfather once commanded the\r\nfrigate “Constitution,” and I am standing by the old ship--while our\r\nmoney-masters and their hired political servants are trying to torpedo\r\nit. When I try to read the Constitution of my country in a public\r\nplace, and a drunken chief of police throws me into jail, and drunken\r\nnewspaper publishers shout with approval--well, Judd, I bide my time.\r\nI once spent two years reading the history of the period prior to the\r\nCivil War, and I know what the moral forces of America are. I know how\r\nlong they wait, and how slow they seem to be in getting into motion;\r\nnevertheless, they are there, and I make my appeal to them, and I\r\nexpect to hear it answered. I am taking care of my health, with the\r\nidea of living to sing once more the Battle Hymn of the Republic: “Mine\r\neyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!”\r\n\r\nI have written these letters as an act of service to my country. I\r\npersonally am not suffering, as you know; I have won my fight, to\r\nthe extent that I am an independent man, and no one can muzzle me.\r\nBut how can I be happy in this so-called civilization, where I see\r\non every hand about me war and the preparation for war, poverty and\r\nthe despair which poverty brings, crime and prostitution, suicide and\r\ninsanity--such a mass of misery that I cannot face the thought of\r\nit, and all those beauties of nature and art which in my youth set\r\nme a-thrill from top to toe, now mean hardly anything to me, because\r\nof the wrongs I see about me--and all so needless, Judd, so utterly,\r\nutterly needless!\r\n\r\nAnd something just as bad as the misery of the poor, the decay in the\r\nsouls of the rich! To see a whole society chasing false ideals, vanity\r\nand luxury and waste; admiring and imitating wretched parasites, who\r\nhave millions of dollars and not one useful thing to do! I know a\r\nfew of these people, Judd, their lives touch mine here and there,\r\nand the truth is they are just as unhappy as the poor, and just as\r\nmuch to be wept over, with their jazz and their bootleggers and their\r\npetting parties and their pitiful empty heads. A brief little hour of\r\nexcitement and display--and then so much suffering, and bewilderment,\r\ndespair about life, and cynicism about everything sound and true. I\r\nthink of the millionaire youth I know, drinking himself to death; and\r\nthe gay young society matron with a venereal disease in her blood and\r\nterror in her heart--I feel like calling upon the useful workers of\r\nAmerica to organize and save the rich from the misery of being out of\r\nwork!\r\n\r\nWhat we want, Judd, is a world with neither rich nor poor, but with\r\npeople who live by producing, and not by taking what others have\r\nproduced. We want to make that sort of world, and we call to our aid\r\nall men and women who are willing to work for it. We want to study this\r\nproblem, and fill our minds with real information, and stop reading the\r\npoison press of our enemies. Indeed, Judd, it is not too much to say\r\nthat we want to make over our moral and mental life, so that we cease\r\nto admire the ideals of our exploiters--waste and the display of waste,\r\nplundering and the power to plunder. We want to teach ourselves and our\r\nchildren to admire useful labor, and social vision, and loyalty to the\r\ncause of those who produce. We who serve that cause call one another\r\n“comrade,” or “brother,” or “fellow-worker”; and we invite you to join\r\nour ranks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUPTON SINCLAIR\r\n\r\nPASADENA CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 15, 1926.\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIEND:\r\n\r\nI do not think that since the world began there has ever been a people\r\nso lied to as the American people to-day. There are 110,000,000 of\r\nus, and at least 105,000,000 are completely befuddled by a campaign\r\nof deception, backed by the whole power of American big business, the\r\nnewspapers, the magazines, the movies, the radio, the vast machinery of\r\ngovernment, and the two major political parties. I am supposed to be\r\nworking on a novel, “Oil,” to the writing of which I had hoped to give\r\nthe next year; but I couldn’t stand it, so I took a couple of months\r\noff, to pay a debt which an honest American owes to his ancestors--to\r\nhelp break the power of the organized knaves who are looting our\r\ncountry in broad daylight.\r\n\r\nI have written a little book, “Letters to Judd.” It is running serially\r\nin the “American Appeal,” where some of you may be reading it. Judd\r\nis an old carpenter who has worked for us off and on, a typical,\r\nold-fashioned American; I have taken him as the type of person I\r\nwant to reach, and have written him a series of nineteen letters,\r\ntelling those elementary facts which our ruling classes are trying so\r\ndesperately to keep hidden from us all. This is the first time I have\r\ncovered our political and social problems fully, since “The Industrial\r\nRepublic,” which was published 19 years ago, and has been out of\r\nprint more than half that time. My mail is full of letters asking for\r\nsomething of the sort, so here you have it.\r\n\r\nThe book tells why there is poverty in the richest country in the\r\nworld. It proves that in America for the past thirty-five years the\r\nrich have been growing richer and the poor poorer, and it shows\r\nexactly what the rich have done to bring this condition about, and\r\nexactly what the poor will have to do to change it. It explains\r\nunemployment and hard times, the money system, inflation, stock\r\nwatering and manipulation, the tariff and the trusts. It studies the\r\nworld situation, explaining the wars we have had, and showing how the\r\npresent system is preparing new ones. It discusses Russia and the\r\nrevolution--in short, everything the average man or woman needs to know\r\nabout affairs at home and abroad, and all in plain, everyday language.\r\nIt is a 100% American book, intended for 100% American readers, and it\r\nis written and published as an act of love for our country.\r\n\r\nA few times past we have had great crises, and it has been found\r\npossible to reach the people by a pamphlet. Paine’s “The Crisis,” and\r\nHelper’s “The Impending Crisis,” “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” “Progress and\r\nPoverty,” “Looking Backward”--these books have helped to make our\r\nhistory. I am making a try at this kind of thing; I mean, I have put\r\naside everything else, and done my best to make a good job, to get the\r\nfacts, and make them fool-proof, as well as knave-proof, and to present\r\nthem in such a way that anyone can understand them. Thirty years’ study\r\nof our problems has gone into the book, also thirty years of learning\r\nhow to write. Having faith in our people, I have borrowed money, and\r\ngone ahead to make the plates and print twelve thousand copies; now I\r\nam appealing to you to do the rest of the job--to see that the “Letters\r\nto Judd” reach the millions of “Judds” who need them.\r\n\r\nThe book will be in two editions: first two thousand cloth bound,\r\nprice $1, to enable my friends to pay the cost of the undertaking;\r\nand second, ten thousand copies, paper bound, a neatly printed\r\nwire-stitched pamphlet, to be sold at meetings, and passed about among\r\nworkingmen and women; this is the form for which I hope to get a\r\nmillion or two circulation, and I have put the price so low that nobody\r\nwill suspect me of making money--15 cents a copy, or ten copies for\r\na dollar. This 15 cent price for a single paper copy is a price for\r\nmeetings and book-stores--I cannot mail the book for that, because,\r\nincluding postage, wrapping, and overhead, it costs about 15 cents to\r\nhandle an order in my office. What I ask you to do is to order at least\r\n10 paper copies to give to your friends, and in addition a cloth copy\r\nfor your library. I will take a gamble and say: place a $2 order, for\r\none cloth and 10 paper copies, and when you have read the book, if you\r\ndon’t find it worth distributing, you may send back the whole lot, and\r\nI’ll send back your money. I ask for a prompt response, as I want to\r\nadvertise the book, and haven’t the money. Both editions will be ready\r\nfor shipment by the time your order gets back to me.\r\n\r\nOur reprint of “The Moneychangers” has been ready for a couple of\r\nmonths, and if you haven’t seen it, here is a reminder. This novel,\r\nfirst published in 1908, tells the story of the panic of 1907, how and\r\nwhy it was brought about by the elder J. P. Morgan. I do not recommend\r\nit as a great work of literature; reading it over, I found many\r\ncrudities, some of which I remedied. But I will guarantee it a lively\r\nstory, full of facts about Wall Street which the American people do not\r\nyet understand.\r\n\r\nAlso, my wife has published a new volume by Mrs. Kate Crane-Gartz,\r\nauthor of “The Parlor Provocateur.” The new volume is called “Letters\r\nof Protest,” the price is $1 cloth and fifty cents paper. The book is\r\nfull of that burning indignation at social injustice, combined with\r\nmotherly tenderness, which has made Mrs. Gartz the bewilderment of\r\nthe prosecuting officials of Los Angeles county. They want so much to\r\nsend her to jail, but they don’t quite dare! I was talking the other\r\nday with a prominent physician of Los Angeles, and he mentioned his\r\nintimate friend, the president of the Better America Federation, the\r\npropaganda society of big business here in California. “He doesn’t love\r\nyou, Upton,” said the physician, “but Kate Gartz is the real one who\r\ngets his nanny.”\r\n\r\nThe money which has come in from our “Loan Plan” has gone into the\r\nprinting and binding of “Bill Porter” and “The Moneychangers,” a part\r\npayment on a new edition of “The Cry for Justice,” a new binding of\r\n“The Jungle,” and finally, this circular. More money is needed for\r\na new printing and binding of “The Profits of Religion,” and for\r\nadvertising the “Letters to Judd.” Also my novel, “Sylvia,” is out of\r\nprint, and I’d reprint it if I could afford the luxury. So I tell you\r\nagain about this “Sinclair Loan Plan.” Those who believe in my work\r\nand want to promote it lend me what they can afford, and the money\r\nserves as working capital, to pay for the new plates and stock of\r\nbooks which a publishing business has to keep on hand. The lenders\r\nreceive a certificate of indebtedness, and have the right to buy each\r\nyear a quantity of my books at half the retail price. Thus, if you\r\nlend ten dollars, you can get $5 worth of books for $2.50. These books\r\nmust be ordered in one shipment, so as to save handling costs; under\r\nthe Loan Plan you may place one such half-price order every year. The\r\nsaving takes the place of interest on your money; it amounts to 25%\r\ninterest--a pretty good rate, but not so high as millions of poor\r\nfarmers are having to pay to national banks all over the country--see\r\nmy “Letters to Judd”!\r\n\r\nI want to cover all the details of this Loan Plan, so as to avoid\r\nhaving to write long explanations. If you have already come in under\r\nthe plan, and have your certificate of indebtedness, you may order\r\nbooks once in the year 1926, to the amount of one-half of your loan.\r\nThus, if you have loaned $10, you may order $5 worth of books for\r\n$2.50; you can get, for example, one cloth and ten paper copies of\r\n“Letters to Judd,” one cloth “Mammonart,” one paper “Bill Porter,” and\r\none paper copy of Mrs. Gartz’s book, all for $2.50. I will throw in a\r\ncopy of my wife’s “Sonnets,”--and if you know any place in the world\r\nwhere you can get as much value in books for the money, I do not!\r\n\r\nIf you are not at present at subscriber to the Loan Plan, you are\r\ninvited to join. Send $12.50, and you will receive a certificate for a\r\n$10 loan, with the privilege of getting your money back at any time on\r\nthirty days’ notice. Also you will receive $5 worth of books, and will\r\nhave the privilege each year of ordering another $5 worth of books for\r\n$2.50. Most of my readers say they don’t want the certificates, but I\r\nsend them just the same; paste them in your autograph album, and some\r\nday they may be worth the price in that form, and without hurting the\r\npublishing business!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nUPTON SINCLAIR.\r\n\r\nP. S. We have received from our German publishers, the Malik Verlag of\r\nBerlin, five stately volumes, the “Collected Novels of Upton Sinclair.”\r\nFrom Gossizdat, the State Publishing House of Moscow, we have a list of\r\nvarious editions of our books which have been issued in Soviet Russia;\r\ncounting, not new printings, but separate publications under different\r\ntitles, there is a total of sixty-nine. Michael Gold, recently returned\r\nfrom Russia, writes: “The sort of people who in America know Charlie\r\nChaplin and Jackie Coogan, in Russia know Upton Sinclair.” We are\r\nadvised by the Japanese translator of “The Jungle” that the book has\r\njust been issued, but the government compelled the publisher to recall\r\nall copies, and cut out the last chapters, dealing with Socialism. The\r\nJapanese translation of “Mammonart” is about to appear. From Warsaw\r\ncomes an offer from a large publishing house to issue twenty of our\r\nbooks in a cheap library, at .95 zloty per volume, about thirteen cents\r\nAmerican. A Czechish publisher applies for all books not hitherto\r\nissued. We have a review of “Mammonart” which was broadcasted from the\r\nradio station of the Labour Party of Australia; also a letter from a\r\nUkrainian writer, telling how our plays are being acted there, and\r\nour novels made into movies. We have established book-store agencies\r\nin London, India and South Africa, and we learn that readers are\r\ncirculating our books in Java, Honduras, and Iceland. We await returns\r\nfrom the U. S. A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Letters to Judd,” cloth $1.00; paper 15 cents, 10 for $1.00.\r\n\r\n     “Bill Porter,” a drama of O. Henry in prison.
