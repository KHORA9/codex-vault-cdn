B. LIPPINCOTT & CO.,\r\n  1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1860, by\r\n  J. B. LIPPINCOTT & CO.,\r\n\r\n  In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States for the\r\n  Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WORD FROM THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese annals were first published in 1840. They reappear after an\r\ninterval of twenty years. In that interval the old questions which\r\ninflamed the zeal and sharpened the wit of parties have totally\r\ndisappeared from the political field: the parties themselves have\r\nfermented into new compounds, and lost all cognizable identity. Old\r\nwarriors, who dealt mortal blows on each other's sconce, have sunk to\r\nsleep in the same truckle bed, and have waked up in mutual surprise to\r\nfind themselves in each other's arms, with a new flag above them, and\r\nnew and unaccustomed voices giving the word of command.\r\n\r\nThe youth who have grown up to manhood in the mean time, and have come\r\nto be conspicuous in the conduct of public affairs, compose a distinct\r\ngeneration, as unconscious of the events, the interests, and sentiments\r\nof twenty years ago as of those of remote antiquity. These not only\r\nreject the traditions and teachings of the past, but repudiate and\r\nignore the whole scheme of social and political opinion of the men who\r\nhave gone before them, disdaining to adopt their maxims of government,\r\ntheir policy, their forbearance, their toleration, or their affections.\r\nThey inaugurate a new era of new principles, new purposes, new powers,\r\nnew morals, and, alas! of new hatreds.\r\n\r\nMay it not serve a good turn toward arresting this torrent of\r\ninnovation, to present to the leisure meditation of those who are\r\nembarking upon its stream, a few memorials of a bygone day, quite as\r\ndistinguished as the present for the intensity of its political ardors\r\nand the absurdity of its excesses, but, fortunately, more harmless and\r\namiable in its temper? Is it not worth while to attempt, by these\r\nplayful sketches of the past, to lure the angry combatants into a smile,\r\nand, by showing them the grotesque retribution which history inflicts\r\nupon distempered parties after a few decades of oblivion, to beguile\r\nthem into some consideration of the predicament in which they may leave\r\ntheir own renown? May not all sober-minded lovers of their country\r\ncontemplate with some profit the _morale_ of a picture--even as light\r\nand extravagant as this--which represents the engrossments of parties\r\nwho fancied that the destinies of a great nation hung upon the plots and\r\ncounterplots of their busy ferment,--which engrossments, with all their\r\nconcomitant gravities and glorifications, twenty years have shriveled\r\ninto the dimensions of a pleasant farce--a little stage imbroglio of\r\ncomic conceits and fussy nothings?\r\n\r\nThat intrepidity of absurdity which no responsible individual would dare\r\nto countenance in his own conduct, and which is only possible to\r\norganized bodies propelled by the ardor of party enthusiasm, is a fact\r\nin human action worth the study of the philosopher. By some unexplored\r\ntidal law, parties would seem to move through successive ebb and flow\r\ntoward a final culmination of mischievous extreme, each refluent wave\r\nreturning with heavier mass, until the accumulated weight of madness and\r\nfolly overtopples, breaks, and dissolves in noisy foam. As we have a\r\ncomputed cycle of a money-crisis, the known result of an increasing and\r\nrapid prosperity ill used, so also we have the regularly recurring\r\npolitical crisis, the result of increasing party-power abused by rash\r\nand insolent presumption upon its strength.\r\n\r\nThis century has run out its three periods of twenty years. The first\r\nended in the total absorption of all differences of opinion, bringing a\r\nstagnant calm upon the waters of ancient strife. The second culminated\r\nin a revolution that shook a great party out of its seat;--a revolution\r\nwhich these annals were designed to illustrate. The third period has\r\nwheeled through its course, to work another downfall and another\r\nrevolution more notable and significant than either that have gone\r\nbefore. The fourth, let us hope, may find a nation restored to\r\nreason;--a great united Republic, tried and purified by the experience\r\nof dangers incurred and surmounted, and by an awakened patriotism\r\nsuccessfully asserting the predominance of the good sense and virtue of\r\nthe people over the factious spirit that ministers to personal ambition,\r\nand the vanity that seeks renown in innovations upon either the\r\nprinciples in which the Union was formed, or the sentiment by which it\r\nis to be preserved.\r\n\r\nBut these reflections are tending toward a graver subject than it would\r\nbe becoming to discuss here. So, I leave them for some more appropriate\r\noccasion. If I have any reason to fear the annals of Quodlibet may find\r\nno favor with the emerging generation, I can make sure of another class\r\nof readers to whom I look with a staunch and unfaltering trust;--that\r\ngoodly host of ripe and considerate citizens, the survivors of\r\n1840--that salt of the earth, who live on the past, and reckon old\r\nmemories to be better than a fresh and damp morning journal. To you, old\r\nfriends, bald on the crown, gray and feathery about the temples, with\r\njovial glance of the eye, showing a heart made kind by trials, and who\r\nlove your country with an affection that grows out of the straits in\r\nwhich you have seen her, and the faith you have that Providence has\r\nhelped her through them, and will help her through many more: to you,\r\nseasoned and made jocund by time, and who, both as supporters and\r\nantagonists, have run through the career of passion and delusion, and\r\noutlived the wrath, the cunning, and the falsehood, the grandiloquent\r\nfervor and exaggerated importance of the old political quarrels; to you\r\nI dedicate this new edition of this book and consign it to your\r\nprotection, with the affectionate trust of a fellow-soldier, (whether as\r\ncomrade or opponent,--as kindly in one character as the other,) in the\r\nwhilom war of bloodless campaigns, in which for years we were mutually\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nThe astute reader of these annals, if he but truly analyze their\r\nphilosophy, may obtain a revelation more or less intelligible of what is\r\nacting on the stage to-day, and even arrive at some data by which he may\r\ncast a horoscope of the time to come. History is constantly reproducing\r\nitself. Events have different dates, and run in different names; but\r\nmotives, human action and passion, are the same, and bring to light the\r\nsame categories of thought and opinion. That which has been, is, and\r\nwill be again, through an infinite series of repetitions. Thus we read\r\nthe present and the future in the past. And in this light I affirm the\r\nannals to be a fair and veritable history of this time. Change a few\r\nsecondary particulars, and the reader will find 1840 a type of 1860.\r\n\r\nWould that in these grotesque absurdities of the busy world of twenty\r\nyears ago the men who shape and control the political issues of this day\r\nmay see some reflected images of themselves, and thus find a motive to\r\nmake interest with posterity for a better report twenty years hence!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIENDLY READER:--\r\n\r\nOf a truth, we are a great people!--and most happy am I, Solomon\r\nSecondthoughts, Schoolmaster of the Borough of Quodlibet, that it hath\r\nfallen to my lot, even in my small way, to make known to you how in our\r\nBorough that greatness hath grown toward its perfect maturity--feeling\r\npersuaded that Quodlibet therein is but an abstract or miniature\r\nportrait of this nation. Happy am I, although sorely oppressed with an\r\ninward perception of my defective craft in this most worthy task, that I\r\nhave been thought by our Central Committee a fit expounder of that\r\nhistory wherein is _enchrysalized_ (if I may be allowed to draw a word,\r\n_parce detortum_, from the Greek mint) the most veritable essence of\r\nthat recently discovered Democratic theory, for distinction called the\r\nQuodlibetarian, which is destined to supplant all other principles in\r\nour government, and to render us the most formidable and the most\r\nimposing people upon the terraqueous globe.\r\n\r\nHow it came to pass that this duty has been committed to my hands, you\r\nshall learn.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the late Judge Flam, now thirty years gone by, and long\r\nbefore Quodlibet was, that very considerate and astute gentleman honored\r\nme, a poor and youthful scholar, with a promotion to the office of\r\nprivate tutor in his family, then residing at their ancient seat in this\r\nneighborhood. It was my especial duty, in this station, to prepare\r\nMaster Middleton, the eldest born, for college; which in three years of\r\nassiduous labor was achieved, much to my content, and, I need not\r\nscruple to affirm, no less to my honor, seeing how notably my pupil has\r\nsince figured in high places among the salt of the nation. Far be it\r\nfrom me to take an undue share of desert for this consummation; it would\r\nbe disingenuous not to say that my pupil's liberal endowments at the\r\nhand of Nature herself rendered my task easy of success.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of my early patron the Judge, whose memory will long be\r\nembalmed in the unction of my gratitude, I became, after Master\r\nMiddleton was passed from under my care, the head of our district\r\nschool, which at first was established in that lowly log building under\r\nthe big chestnut upon the Rumblebottom, about fifty rods south of\r\nChristy M'Curdy's mill--which tenement is yet to be seen, although in a\r\nmelancholy state of desolation, the roof thereof having been blown away\r\nin the famous hurricane of August, 1836, just two years and ten months\r\nafter the Removal of the Deposits. This unfortunate event--I mean the\r\nblowing off of the roof--it was the mercy of Providence to delay for the\r\nterm of one year and a fraction of a month after I had removed into the\r\nnew academy which my former pupil, and now, in lineal succession to his\r\nlamented parent the Judge, my second patron, the Hon. Middleton Flam,\r\nhad procured to be erected for my better accommodation in the Borough of\r\nQuodlibet. Had my removal been delayed, or the hurricane have risen\r\nthirteen months sooner than it did, who shall tell what mourning it\r\nmight not have spread through our country side--who shall venture to say\r\nthat Quodlibet might not have been to-day without a chronicler?\r\n\r\nThis long inhabiting of mine in these parts has afforded me all\r\ndesirable opportunities to note the growth of the region, and especially\r\nto mark out the beginnings, the progression, and the sudden magnifying\r\nof our Borough; and being a man--I speak it not vaingloriously--of an\r\ninquiring turn, and strongly gifted, as our people of Quodlibet are\r\npleased to allow, with the perfection of setting down my thoughts in\r\nwriting; and having that essential requisite of the historian, an ardent\r\nand unquenchable love of my subject, it has ever been my custom to put\r\ninto my tablets whatsoever I have deemed noteworthy in the events and\r\nopinions of my day, accompanied by such reflections thereon as my\r\nsubject might be found to invite. Some of these memorabilia,\r\nwith discourses pertinent to the same, have I from time to time,\r\ndistrustfully and with the proper timidity of authorship, ventured to\r\ncontribute to our newspaper, and thereby has my secret vanity been\r\nregaled by seeing myself in print. By what token I have not yet\r\nascertained, but these lucubrations of mine were not long ago discovered\r\nto our \"Grand Central Committee of Unflinching New-Light Quodlibetarian\r\nDemocrats,\" who have been charged with the arduous duty of maintaining\r\nthe integrity of the party in the present alarming crisis, and\r\nof promoting, by all means in their power, the indefeasible,\r\nunquestionable, and perpetual right of succession to the Presidential\r\nChair, claimed by and asserted for the candidate of the great,\r\nunterrified New Democratic school of patriotic defenders of the spoils.\r\nThis Central Committee now hold their sessions weekly in Quodlibet--and\r\nhaving discovered my hand in the lucubrations to which I have alluded\r\nabove, they have been pleased to express a favorable opinion thereon;\r\nand, as a sequence thereto, it has occurred to them to fancy that my\r\npoor labors being duly given to the compiling of such a history as my\r\ntablets might afford of the rise and progress of the New Democratic\r\nprinciple in Quodlibet, the same would greatly redound to the advantage\r\nof the cause in the present great struggle. Acting upon this suggestion,\r\nthe Grand Central Committee have honored me with a request to throw into\r\nsuch shape as I might deem best these scattered records of opinion and\r\nchronicles of fact, whereof I was supposed to have a rich magazine.\r\n\r\nReadily and cheerfully have I acceded to this request; and with the more\r\nrelish, as I shall thus be furnished with an authentic occasion to\r\npresent to the world the many valuable thoughts and eloquent utterings\r\nof my late distinguished pupil, and now beneficent patron, the Hon.\r\nMiddleton Flam, long a representative of this Borough and the adjacent\r\ndistrict in the Congress of the United States.\r\n\r\nI pretend to no greater merit in this execution of my task than what an\r\nimpartial spirit of investigation, a long acquaintance with persons of\r\nevery degree connected with this history, an apt judgment in\r\ndiscriminating between opinions, a most faithful and abundant memory, a\r\ncareful store of documentary evidence, an unalterable devotion to the\r\ngreat principles of Quodlibetarian Democracy, and, for the expounding of\r\nall, a lucid and felicitous style, may allow me to claim as the\r\nchronicler of this Borough.\r\n\r\nThe better to assure you, my friendly reader, that, in temper and\r\ncondition, I may demand somewhat of the confidence due to the character\r\nof a dispassionate commentator on the times, I would have you understand\r\nthat I am now on the shady side of sixty, unmarried, and in possession\r\nof an easy revenue of four hundred dollars per annum, which is voted to\r\nme by our commissioners, for instructing in their rudiments thirty-seven\r\nchildren of both sexes; that I have a plate at the table of my patron,\r\nthe Hon. Middleton Flam, my former pupil, every Sunday at dinner; and\r\nthat he, being aware for some time past of my purpose to treasure up his\r\nremarkable sayings, has, with a generous freedom, often repeated to me\r\nmany opinions which otherwise would have been irretrievably lost.\r\nMoreover, since I am now brought before the public under circumstances\r\nin which reserve on my part would be no better than affectation, I would\r\nalso advertise my indulgent reader of the fact that I belong to the\r\nQuodlibetarian New-Light Club, whereof I some time officiated as\r\nSecretary, and which club generally meets on Saturday night at Ferret's;\r\nthat the members of the same, noting my staidness of deportment and the\r\ncareful deliberation with which I guard myself in the utterance of any\r\ndiscourse, do frequent honor to the temperance of my judgment by making\r\nme the arbiter of such casual controversies as arise therein, touching\r\nthe true import and application of the principles of our New-Light\r\nDemocracy; and--if I run no risk of being charged with offering a\r\ntrivial evidence of the reputation I have earned in the club--I would\r\nalso mention, that some of our light wags have gone so far--facetiously\r\nand with a commendable good nature, knowing that I would not take it\r\nill, as more peevish men might, in their jocular pleasantry--as to call\r\nme, in allusion to my natural sedateness, SOBER SECONDTHOUGHTS:--the\r\nrogues!\r\n\r\nAnd now, amiable and considerate reader, you have \"ab imo pectore\" my\r\nhonest avouch for what I propose to lay before you, and a plain\r\nconfession of my weaknesses. I come with a clean breast to the\r\nconfessional. We shall have a frugal banquet of it, but the fruits, I\r\nmake bold to promise, shall be wholesome and of the best. Now turn we to\r\nit in good earnest. If this little chronicle--for my book shall not be\r\novergrown and apoplectic, but rather, as you shall find it, \"garrulous\r\nand thin\"--do not bring you to a profound sense of the value of this\r\nAmaranth of Republicanism, the New-Light Quodlibetarian Democracy, then\r\nsay it to my teeth, there is no virtue in SOBER SECONDTHOUGHTS. Go thy\r\nways--\"The wise man's eyes are in his head, but the fool walketh in\r\ndarkness.\"\r\n\r\n                                                  S.

Our folks are accustomed to set this down to the Removal\r\nof the Deposits. Indeed, until that famous event, Quodlibet was, as one\r\nmight say in common parlance, a place not worth talking about--it might\r\nhardly be remarked upon the maps. But since that date, verily, like\r\nJeshurun, it has waxed fat. It has thus come to pass that \"The Removal\"\r\nis a great epoch in our annals--our Hegira--the A. U. C. of all\r\nQuodlibetarians.\r\n\r\nMichael Grant, a long time ago--that is to say, full twenty years--had\r\na tanyard on Rumblebottom Creek, occupying the very ground which is now\r\ncovered by the canal basin. Even as far back as that day he had laid up,\r\nout of the earnings of his trade, a snug sum of money, which sufficed to\r\npurchase the farm where he now lives at the foot of the Hogback.\r\nQuodlibet, or that which now is Quodlibet, was then as nothing.\r\nMichael's dwelling house and tanyard, Abel Brawn's blacksmith-shop,\r\nChristy M'Curdy's mill, and my school-house, made up the sum-total of\r\nthe settlement. It is now ten years, or hard on to it, since the\r\ncommissioners came this way and put the cap-sheaf on Michael's worldly\r\nfortune by ruining his tanyard and breaking up his business, whereof the\r\ndamage was so taken to heart by the jury that, in their rage against\r\ninternal improvements, they brought in a verdict which doubled Mr.\r\nGrant's estate in ready money, besides leaving him two acres of town\r\nlots bordering on the basin, and which, they say, are worth more to-day\r\nthan the whole tanyard with its appurtenances ever was worth in its best\r\ntime. This verdict wrought a strange appetite in our county, among the\r\nlandholders, to be ruined in the same way; and I truly believe it was a\r\nchief cause of the unpopularity of internal improvements in this\r\nneighborhood, that the commissioners were only able to destroy the farms\r\non the lowlands--which fact, it was said, brought down the price of the\r\nuplands on the whole line of the canal, besides creating a great deal of\r\nill humor among all who were out of the way of being damaged.\r\n\r\nWith the money which this verdict brought him, Mr. Grant improved a\r\npart of his two acres--which he was persuaded to cut up into town\r\nlots--by building the brick tavern, and the store that stands next door\r\nto it. These were the first buildings of any note in Quodlibet, and are\r\ngenerally supposed to have given rise to the incorporation of the\r\nBorough by the Legislature. Jesse Ferret took a lease of the tavern as\r\nsoon as it was finished, and set up the sign of \"The Hero\"--meaning\r\nthereby General Jackson--which, by-the-by, was the first piece of\r\nhistorical painting that the celebrated Quipes ever attempted. The store\r\nwas rented by Frederick Barndollar for his son Jacob, who was just then\r\ngoing to marry Ferret's daughter Susan, and open in the Iron and Flour\r\nForwarding and Commission line, in company with Anthony Hardbottle, his\r\nown brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of things in Quodlibet five years before \"The\r\nRemoval,\" from which period, up to the date of the Removal, although\r\nBarndollar & Hardbottle did a tolerable business, and Ferret had a fair\r\nrun of custom, there were not above a dozen new tenements built in the\r\nBorough. But a bright destiny was yet in reserve for Quodlibet; and as I\r\npropose to unfold some incidents of its history belonging to these later\r\ntimes, I cannot pretermit the opportunity now afforded me to glance,\r\nthough in a perfunctory and hasty fashion, at some striking events which\r\nseemed to presignify and illustrate its marvelously sudden growth.\r\n\r\nI think it was in the very month of the Removal of the Deposits, that\r\nTheodore Fog broke up at Tumbledown, on the other side of the Hogback,\r\nand came over to Quodlibet to practice law. And it was looked upon as a\r\nvery notable thing, that, in the course of the following winter,\r\nNicodemus Handy should have also quitted Tumbledown and brought his\r\nsign, as a lottery agent, to Quodlibet, and set up that business in our\r\nBorough. There was a wonderful intimacy struck up between him and Fog,\r\nand a good many visits were made by Nicodemus during the fall, before he\r\ncame over to settle. Our people marveled at this matter, and were not a\r\nlittle puzzled to make out the meaning of it, knowing that Nicodemus\r\nHandy was a shrewd man, and not likely, without some good reason for it,\r\nto strike up a friendship with a person so little given to business as\r\nTheodore Fog, against whom I desire to say nothing, holding his\r\nabilities in great respect, but meaning only to infer that as Theodore\r\nis considered high-flown in his speech, and rather too fond of living\r\nabout Ferret's bar-room, it was thought strange that Nicodemus, who is\r\nplain spoken, and of the Temperance principle, should have taken up with\r\nhim. It was not long after Mr. Handy had seated himself in Quodlibet,\r\nand placed his sign at the door of a small weather-boarded office, ten\r\nfeet by twelve, and within a stone-throw of Fog's, before the public\r\nwere favored with an insight into the cause of this intimacy between\r\nthese two friends. This was disclosed in a plan for establishing The\r\nPatriotic Copperplate Bank of Quodlibet, the particulars whereof were\r\nmade known at a meeting held in the dining-room of \"The Hero\" one\r\nevening in March, when Theodore Fog made a flowery speech on the subject\r\nto ten persons, counting Ferret and Nim Porter the bar-keeper. The\r\ncapital of the bank was proposed to be half a million, and the stock one\r\nhundred dollars a share, of which one dollar was to be paid in, and the\r\nremainder to be secured by promissory notes, payable on demand, if\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\nThis excellent scheme found many supporters; and, accordingly, when the\r\ntime came for action, the whole amount was subscribed by Handy and Fog\r\nand ten of their particular friends, who had an eye to being directors\r\nand officers of the bank--to whom might also be added about thirty\r\nboatmen, who, together with the boys of my academy, lent their names to\r\nMr. Handy.\r\n\r\nThrough the liberality of Fog, the necessary cash was supplied out of\r\nthree hundred dollars, the remains of a trust fund in his hands\r\nbelonging to a family of orphans in the neighborhood of Tumbledown, who\r\nhad not yet had occasion to know from their attorney, the said Theodore\r\nFog himself, of their success in a cause relating to this fund which had\r\nbeen gained some months before. As Nicodemus managed the subscriptions,\r\nwhich indeed he did with wonderful skill, these three hundred dollars\r\nwent a great way in making up the payments on considerably more than the\r\nmajority of the stock: and this being adjusted, he undertook a visit to\r\nthe Legislature, where, through the disinterested exertions of some\r\nstaunch Democratic friends, he procured a most unexceptionable charter\r\nfor the bank, full of all sorts of provisions, conditions, and clauses\r\nnecessary to enable it to accommodate the public with as much paper\r\nmoney as the said public could possibly desire.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of these great services, Nicodemus Handy elected\r\nhimself Cashier; and, at the same time, had well-nigh fallen into a\r\nquarrel with Fog, who had set his heart upon being President--which, in\r\nview of the fact that that gentleman's habits were somewhat irregular\r\nafter twelve o'clock in the day, Nicodemus would by no means consent to.\r\nThis dissension, however, was seemingly healed, by bringing in as\r\nPresident my worshipful pupil, the Hon. Middleton Flam, now our member\r\nof Congress, and by making Theodore one of the directors, besides giving\r\nhim the law business of the bank. It was always thought, notwithstanding\r\nFog pretended to be satisfied at the time with this arrangement, that it\r\nrankled in his bosom, and bred a jealousy between him and his associates\r\nin the bank, and helped to drive him to drinking faster than he would\r\nnaturally have done, if his feelings had not been aggravated by this act\r\nof supposed ingratitude.\r\n\r\nI should not omit to mention that Nicodemus Handy was a man of exact\r\nand scrupulous circumspection, and noted for the deliberation with which\r\nhe weighed the consequences of his actions, or, as the common saying is,\r\n\"looked before he leapt\"--a remarkable proof of which kind of wisdom he\r\nafforded at this time. Having been compelled by circumstances to live\r\nbeyond the avails of his lottery business, and thereby to bring himself\r\nunder some impracticable liabilities, he made it a point of conscience,\r\nbefore he could permit himself to be clothed with the dignity of a\r\ncashier, or even to place a share of stock in his own name on the books,\r\nto swear out in open court, and to surrender, for the benefit of\r\nhis numerous and patient creditors, his whole stock of worldly\r\ngoods--consisting, according to the inventory thereof on record, which I\r\nhave seen, of a cylindrical sheet-iron stove, two chairs, a desk and a\r\nsign-board, this latter being, as I remember, of the shape of a screen,\r\non each leaf of which \"NICODEMUS HANDY\" was printed, together with the\r\nscheme of a lottery, set forth in large red and blue letters. He barely\r\nretained what the law allowed him, being his mere wearing apparel; to\r\nwit, a bran new suit of black superfine Saxony, one dozen of the best\r\ncambric linen shirts, as many lawn pocket handkerchiefs, white kid\r\ngloves, and such other trivial but gentlemanlike appurtenances as\r\ndenoted that extreme neatness of dress in which Mr. Handy has ever taken\r\na just pride, and which has been so often remarked by his friends as one\r\nof the strong points in his character. These articles, it was said, he\r\nhad procured not more with a provident eye to that state of destitution\r\ninto which the generous surrender of his property was about to plunge\r\nhim, than with a decent regard to the respectability of appearance which\r\nthe public, he conceived, had a right to exact from the Cashier of the\r\nPatriotic Copperplate Bank of Quodlibet. All right-minded persons will\r\nnaturally commend this prudence, and applaud Mr. Handy's sense of the\r\ndignity proper to so important and elevated a station--a station which\r\nTheodore Fog, in his speech at \"The Hero,\" so appropriately eulogized as\r\none \"of financial, fiscal, and monetary responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nThere was one circumstance connected with the history of the\r\nestablishment of the bank that excited great observation among our\r\nfolks: that was the dislike Michael Grant took up against it from its\r\nvery beginning. It was an indiscriminate, unmitigable, dogged dislike to\r\nthe whole concern, which, by degrees, brought him into a bad opinion of\r\nour Borough, and I verily believe was the cause why, from that time\r\nforward, he kept himself so much at his farm near the Hogback, and grew\r\nto be, as if it were out of mere opposition, so unhappily, and indeed I\r\nmay say, so perversely stubborn in those iniquitous Whig sentiments\r\nwhich he was in the habit of uttering. I have heard him say that he\r\nthought as badly as a man could think, of the grounds for starting the\r\nbank, and still worse of the men who started it,--which, certainly, was\r\na very rash expression, considering that our congressman, the Hon.\r\nMiddleton Flam, was President and one of the first patrons of the\r\ninstitution, and that such a man as Nicodemus Handy was Cashier; to say\r\nnothing of Theodore Fog, whose habits, we are willing to confess, might,\r\nin the estimation of some men, give some little color to my worthy\r\nfriend's vituperation.\r\n\r\nNow, there was no man in Quodlibet whom Handy and Fog so much desired,\r\nor strove so hard, to bring into the bank scheme as Mr. Grant. They made\r\nevery sort of effort and used all kinds of arguments to entice him.\r\nNicodemus Handy on one occasion, I think it was in April, put the matter\r\nto him in such strong points of view, that I have often marveled since\r\nhow the good gentleman stood it. He argued, with amazing cogency, that\r\nGeneral Jackson had removed the deposits for the express purpose of\r\ndestroying the Bank of the United States, and giving the State banks a\r\nfair field: that the Old Hero was an enthusiastic friend to State\r\nrights, and especially to State banks, which it was the desire of his\r\nheart to see increased and multiplied all over the country; that he was\r\nactually, as it were, making pets out of these banks, and was determined\r\nto feed them up with the public moneys and give them such a credit in\r\nthe land as would forever shut out all hope to the friends of a National\r\nBank to succeed with their purpose: and, finally, that although Clay and\r\nthe Whigs were endeavoring to resist the General in his determination to\r\nestablish new banks in the States, that resistance was already\r\nconsidered hopeless. It was with a visible air of triumph that Mr.\r\nHandy, in confirmation of this opinion, read from the Globe of the 21st\r\nof December previous these words:--\r\n\r\n     \"The intelligent people of the West know how to maintain their\r\n     rights and independence, and to repel oppression. Although foiled\r\n     in the beginning, every Western State is about to establish a State\r\n     bank institution. They are resolved to avail themselves of their\r\n     own State credit, as well as of the National credit, to maintain a\r\n     currency independent of foreign control. Mr. Clay's presses in\r\n     Kentucky begin now to feel how vain are all their efforts to resist\r\n     the determination of the people of the West. Ohio, Indiana,\r\n     Illinois, Missouri, and Kentucky are resolved to take care of\r\n     themselves, and no longer depend on the kind guardianship of\r\n     Biddle, Clay & Co.\"\r\n\r\nHaving laid this fact before Mr. Grant, by way of clinching the\r\nargument Mr. Handy pulled out of his pocket a letter which he had\r\njust received from the Secretary of the Treasury. It contained a\r\ncommunication of the deepest import to the future fortunes of our\r\nBorough; which communication, as I have been favored by Mr. Handy with a\r\ncopy, I feel happy to transcribe here for the edification of my reader.\r\nIt is a circular, and came to our cashier printed on gilt-edged\r\nletter-paper, having the title of the bank, the date, and some other\r\nitems filled up in writing.\r\n\r\n               \"TREASURY DEPARTMENT, _April_ 1, 1834.\r\n\r\n     \"SIR:--The Patriotic Copperplate Bank of Quodlibet has been\r\n     selected by this Department as the depository of the public money\r\n     collected in Quodlibet and its vicinity; and the Marshal will hand\r\n     you the form of a contract proposed to be executed, with a copy of\r\n     his instructions from this Department. In selecting your\r\n     institution as one of the fiscal agents of the government, I not\r\n     only rely on its solidity and established character, as affording a\r\n     sufficient guarantee for the safety of the public money intrusted\r\n     to its keeping, but I confide also in its disposition to adopt the\r\n     most liberal course which circumstances will admit toward other\r\n     moneyed institutions generally, and particularly those in your\r\n     vicinity. The deposits of the public money will enable you to\r\n     afford increased facilities to commerce, and to extend your\r\n     accommodations to individuals; and as the duties which are payable\r\n     to the government arise from the business and enterprise of the\r\n     merchants engaged in foreign trade, it is but reasonable that they\r\n     should be preferred in the additional accommodations which the\r\n     public deposits will enable your institution to give, whenever it\r\n     can be done without injustice to the claims of other classes of the\r\n     community.\r\n\r\n     \"I am, etc.,                             R. B. TANEY,\r\n                                    \"_Secretary of the Treasury_.\r\n\r\n     \"_To the President of the Patriotic Copperplate Bank of\r\n     Quodlibet._\"\r\n\r\n\"There, sir,\" said Mr. Handy, after he had read this paper to Mr.\r\nGrant--\"read that over again and tell me if there is any Quodlibetarian\r\nthat ought not to rejoice in this great event, and lend his endeavors,\r\nwith both heart and soul, to promote and sustain an institution so\r\nfavored by the government. The Secretary, you perceive, has confidence\r\nin the 'solidity and established character' of our bank--how can you\r\nrefuse _your_ confidence after that? Sir, the Secretary is an honor to\r\nthe Democracy of Quodlibet:--what does he say? Does he tell us to keep\r\nthe public moneys locked up only for the selfish purposes of the\r\ngovernment? Oh no: far from it; 'the deposits' says he, 'will enable you\r\nto afford increased facilities to commerce, and to extend your\r\naccommodations to individuals.' Mark that! there's a President and\r\nSecretary for you! True friends, Mr. Grant--true friends to the people.\r\nHow careful are they of our great mercantile and trading classes! Sir,\r\nthe government cannot do too much for such people as we are--that's the\r\ntrue Democratic motto--we _expect_ a great deal--but they outrun our\r\nexpectations. No more low prices for grain, Mr. Grant--no more scarcity\r\nof money:--accommodation is the word--better currency is the word--high\r\nprices, good wages and plenty of work is the word now-a-days. We shall\r\nhave a city here before you can cleverly turn yourself round. Depend\r\nupon it, sir, we are destined to become a great, glorious, and immortal\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said Theodore Fog, interposing at this moment, with a look that\r\nwore a compound expression of thoughtful sternness and poetical\r\nfrenzy--\"when the historic muse shall hereafter contemplate the humble\r\norigin of Quodlibet----\"\r\n\r\n\"Fog,\" interrupted Nicodemus, somewhat petulantly--and I feel sorry to\r\nbe obliged to record this inconsiderate language--\"Blame the historic\r\nmuse!--we are now on business.\"\r\n\r\n\"As a director, sir,\" replied Fog, with a subdued air, but with a\r\ndignified gravity, \"I have a _right_ to speak. I meant to say, sir, in\r\nplain phrase, that Quodlibet must inevitably, from this day forth, under\r\nthe proud auspices of democratic principles--obedient to that native\r\nimpulse which the profound statesmanship of this people-sustaining and\r\npeople-sustained administration has imparted to it, soar aloft to place\r\nherself upon the proud pinnacle of commercial prosperity, wealth, and\r\npower. I have no doubt, Mr. Grant, your tavern lot will increase to\r\nthree times its present value. You _ought_ to take stock;--let me tell\r\nyou, sir, as a citizen of Quodlibet, you ought. As to the cash, that's a\r\nbagatelle. Handy and I can let you have any number of shares on your own\r\nterms. Flam will do anything we say to let you in. By-the-by, he got us\r\nthe deposits. Flam's a man of influence--but whether on the whole he\r\nwill make us the best President we could have procured, is perhaps\r\nsomewhat apocryphal.\"\r\n\r\n\"You cannot fail to see,\" said Mr. Handy, \"that we must all make our\r\nfortunes, if the government is only true to its word; and who can doubt\r\nit will be true? We start comparatively with nothing, I may say,\r\nspeaking of myself--absolutely with nothing. We shall make a large issue\r\nof paper, predicated upon the deposits; we shall accommodate everybody,\r\nas the Secretary desires--of course, not forgetting our friends, and\r\nmore particularly ourselves:--we shall pay, in this way, our stock\r\npurchases. You may run up a square of warehouses on the Basin; I will\r\njoin you as a partner in the transaction, give you the plan of\r\noperations, furnish architectural models, supply the funds, et cetera,\r\net cetera. We will sell out the buildings at a hundred per cent. advance\r\nbefore they are finished; Fog here will be the purchaser. We have then\r\nonly to advertise in the papers this extraordinary rise of property\r\nin Quodlibet--procure a map to be made of our new city; get it\r\nlithographed, and immediately sell the lots on the Exchange of New York\r\nat a most unprecedented valuation. My dear sir, I have just bought a\r\nhundred acres of land adjoining the Borough, with an eye to this very\r\nspeculation. You shall have an interest of one-half in this operation at\r\na reasonable valuation--I shall want but a small profit, say two hundred\r\nper cent.--a mere trifle--in consideration of my labors in laying it off\r\ninto streets, lanes, and alleys;--and if there is any convenience in it\r\nto you--although I know you are a moneyed man--you have only to make a\r\nproposal for a slice of accommodation--just drop a note now and then\r\ninto the discount box. You understand. The Secretary will be delighted,\r\nmy dear sir, to hear of our giving an accommodation to you. But there's\r\none thing, Mr. Grant, I must not forget to remark--the Secretary, in\r\nfact, makes it a sort of _sine qua non_--you must come out a\r\ngenuine--declare yourself a Whole Hog--and go for Flam in the\r\nfall elections. The Secretary expects, you know,\" and as he said\r\nthis he laid his finger significantly upon his nose, \"that the\r\naccommodation principle--is to be measurably--extended--in proportion to\r\nthe--Democracy--of the applicants. You understand?--a word to the\r\nwise--that's all. It couldn't be expected, you perceive, that we,\r\nholding the deposits, should be quite as favorable to the Whigs, who\r\nrather charge us with experimenting on the currency--you know--and who,\r\nin fact, don't scruple to say that our banking system will be a\r\nfailure--it couldn't be expected we should be as bountiful to them as to\r\nthose who go with us in building up this concatenation--tweedle dum and\r\ntweedle dee, you know, betwixt you and me;--but it's made a point\r\nof--and has its effect on ulterior expectations--you understand. The\r\nlong and the short is, without being mealy-mouthed, we must prefer the\r\nold Hero's friends;--but, after all, that's a small matter:--be a\r\nDemocrat, and go for Flam!\"\r\n\r\n\"Flam and the immutable principles of civil liberty!\" said Fog, with\r\ngreat animation. \"Middleton Flam, the embodiment and personification of\r\nthose deep and profound truths, based upon the eternal distinctions of\r\nthe greatest good to the greatest number! Diffusive wealth, combined\r\ncapital, increased facilities to commerce, and accommodation to\r\nindividuals--there is the _multum in parvo_ of General Jackson's\r\nDemocratic creed!--there is the glorious consummation of the war with\r\nthe great money power, which, like Juggernaut, was crushing down the\r\nliberties of our Republic!\"\r\n\r\nMichael Grant was a patient listener, and a man of few words. He stood\r\nall the time that Fog and Handy were plying him with this discourse,\r\nwith his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, looking down, with a grum\r\ncogitation, at his own image in the water of the basin, on the margin of\r\nwhich the parties had met, and every now and then rocking on his heels\r\nand flapping the soles of his feet sharply on the ground, denoting, by\r\nthis movement, to those who knew his habit, that he was growing more and\r\nmore positive in his opinion. Once or twice he was observed to raise his\r\nhead, and with one eye half shut, seemed as if studying the heavens. At\r\nlength he broke out with an answer which, from the vehemence of his\r\ntone, caused Handy and Fog to prick up their ears, and gaze upon each\r\nother with a look of incredulous surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Your bank, gentlemen,\" said he, \"is a humbug. Your speculation in lots,\r\nyour accommodations and the fortunes you are going to make, are humbugs.\r\nFlam and the immutable principles of civil liberty are humbugs, and the\r\ngreatest humbug of all is your Democracy.\"\r\n\r\nWith these very rash and inconsiderate words, Mr. Grant turned on his\r\nheel and walked away, leaving Handy and Fog looking significantly at\r\neach other. From that time Mr. Grant was generally considered an enemy\r\nto our bank, and, as far as I can learn, never had any dealings with it.\r\n\r\nMr. Handy set up a dry laugh as soon as Mr. Grant was out of sight, and\r\nlaughed on for some moments. At last he said, somewhat mysteriously, and\r\nwith a great deal of deliberation--\r\n\r\n\"Fog, it's my opinion that the old tanner has cut his eye teeth--what do\r\nyou think of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He labors,\" replied Fog, \"under a sinistrous and defective obliquity\r\nof comprehension; and from all I can make out of this colloquy, I rather\r\nincline to the opinion that he is not _very_ willing to embark largely\r\nin our stock.\" And saying this, Fog folded his arms and looked\r\nsteadfastly in Mr. Handy's face.\r\n\r\n\"Nor, as I should judge,\" said Handy in a kind of whisper, \"is he likely\r\nto join me in my speculation in town lots. Fog, don't forget, you will\r\nindorse my note for the purchase-money of that hundred acres--I shall\r\ndiscount it to-morrow--I like to pay cash--that was always my\r\nprinciple.\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly--consider me a sure card in that line,\" replied Fog:--\"it\r\nis understood, of course, that you reciprocate the favor on my purchase\r\nof the meadow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Without question--assuredly, Fog--one good turn deserves another.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, let's go up and take a drink,\" said Fog, imitating the tone of a\r\ntragedy-player--\"we'll call it twelve, although my dial points but half\r\nway from eleven.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know I never drink,\" quoth Handy.\r\n\r\n\"Then come and look on me while I that act perform,\" said Theodore.\r\n\r\n\"Agreed,\" said Nicodemus. And thereupon these trusty friends went\r\nstraight to Nim Porter's bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  GREAT USEFULNESS OF THE BANK--SURPRISING GROWTH OF\r\n     QUODLIBET--SOME ACCOUNT OF THE HON. MIDDLETON FLAM--ORIGIN\r\n     OF HIS DEMOCRACY--HIS LOGICAL ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF THE\r\n     POCKETING OF THE BILL TO REPEAL THE SPECIE CIRCULAR--THE\r\n     DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE AS DEVELOPED IN THE REPRESENTATIVE\r\n     SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of the first year after The Removal, or as I should say,\r\nin the year One--speaking after our manner in Quodlibet--the bank made\r\nitself very agreeable to everybody. Mr. Flam came home from Congress\r\nafter the end of the long session, and found everything prospering\r\nbeyond his most sanguine expectations. Nicodemus Handy had put a new\r\nweather-boarded room to the back of his office for the use of the\r\nDirectors, and the banking business was transacted in the front\r\napartment where Nicodemus used to sell lottery tickets. There was one\r\nthing that strangers visiting Quodlibet were accustomed to remark upon\r\nin a jocular vein, regarding the bank--and that was the sign which was\r\nplaced, as it were parapet-wise, along the eaves of the roof, and being\r\nof greater longitude than the front of the building, projected\r\nconsiderably at either end. Quipes has been held responsible for this,\r\nbut I know that he could not help it, on account of the length of the\r\nname, which, nevertheless, it is due to him to say he endeavored, very\r\nmuch to my discontent, to shorten, both by orthographical device and by\r\nabbreviation, having painted it thus--\r\n\r\n     THE PATRIOTI^{C} COPERPLAT^{E} BANK OF QUODLI^{bet};\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding which, it overran the dimensions of the tenement to\r\nwhich it was attached. I say strangers sometimes facetiously alluded to\r\nthis discrepancy, by observing that the bank was like the old Hero\r\nhimself, too great for the frame that contained it. And, truly, the bank\r\ndid a great business! Mr. Handy, who is acknowledged to be a man of\r\ntaste, procured one of the handsomest plates, it is supposed, that\r\nMurray, Draper & Fairman ever executed, and with about six bales of\r\npinkish silk paper, and a very superior cylinder press, created an\r\namount of capital which soon put to rest old Mr. Grant's grumbling about\r\nthe want of solidity in the bank, and fully justified the Secretary's\r\ndeclaration of his confidence in its \"established character as affording\r\na sufficient guarantee for the safety of the public money intrusted to\r\nits keeping.\"\r\n\r\nAs a proof how admirably matters were conducted by Mr. Handy, the\r\nDirectors soon found no other reason to attend at the Board than now and\r\nthen to hold a chat upon politics and smoke a cigar; and the President,\r\nthe Hon. Middleton Flam, having his October election on hand, was so\r\nthoroughly convinced of Nicodemus's ability, that I do not believe he\r\nwent into the bank more than half a dozen times during the whole season.\r\n\r\nIt was in the course of this year, and pretty soon after the bank got\r\nthe deposits, that Mr. Handy began his row of four story brick\r\nwarehouses on the Basin, which now goes by the name of Nicodemus Row. He\r\nalso laid the foundation of his mansion on the hill, fronting upon Handy\r\nPlace; and which edifice he subsequently finished, so much to the\r\nadornment of our Borough, with a Grecian portico in front, and an\r\nItalian veranda looking toward the garden. As his improvements advanced\r\nin this and the next year, he successively reared a Temple of Minerva on\r\nthe top of the ice-house, a statue of Apollo in the center of the\r\ncarriage-circle, a sun-dial on a marble pillar where the garden walks\r\nintersect, and a gilded dragon weather-cock on the cupola of the\r\nstables. The new banking house was commenced early in the summer, and\r\nhas been finished of very beautiful granite, being in its front, if I am\r\nrightly informed by Mr. Handy, an exact miniature copy of the Tomb of\r\nOsymandias: it is situated on Flam Street, the first after you leave the\r\nBasin, going northward. All the Directors, except Fog, followed the\r\nfootsteps of their illustrious predecessor, Mr. Handy, and went to work\r\nto build themselves villas on the elevated ground back of the Borough,\r\nnow known by the name of Copperplate Ridge,--which villas were duly\r\ncompleted in all manner of Greek, Roman, and Tuscan fashions. These\r\nbeing likewise imitated, in turn, by many friends of the bank who\r\nmigrated hither from all parts and cast their lines in our Borough,\r\nQuodlibet hath thereby, very suddenly, grown to be, in a figurative\r\nsense, a pattern card of the daintiest structures of the four quarters\r\nof the world. Perhaps I may be too fast in making so broad an\r\nassertion--cupio non putari mendacem--I am not quite sure that, as yet,\r\nwe have any well ascertained specimen of the Asiatic: but if Nicodemus\r\nHandy's pagoda, which he talked of building on the knoll in the center\r\nof his training course, had not been interrupted by an untoward event,\r\nof which it may become my duty to speak hereafter, I should, in that\r\ncase, have made no difficulty in reiterating, with a clear conscience\r\nand without reservation, the remark which distrustfully and with claim\r\nof allowance I have ventured above.\r\n\r\nMy valuable patron not being resident actually within the Borough, and\r\nbeing, as I have said, very busy in the matter of his election during\r\nthe greater part of the first year of the bank, had not much opportunity\r\nto devote himself to its concerns. But the Directors, partly aware of\r\ntheir own knowledge, how valuable was his influence with the Secretary,\r\nand partly persuaded thereof by the Cashier, established, with a\r\nliberality which Mr. Handy remarked at the time was exceedingly\r\ngentlemanlike, his salary as President at three thousand dollars a\r\nyear--which sum, Mr. Flam himself has, more than once in my hearing,\r\naverred upon his honor, he did not consider one cent too much. And\r\nindeed, I feel myself bound to express my concurrence in this opinion,\r\nwhen I reflect upon the weight of his character, the antiquity of his\r\nfamily, the preponderance of his strong Democratic sentiments, and the\r\nexpenses to which, as President, he was exposed in looking after the\r\ninterests of the bank--more especially in the journeys to Washington,\r\nwhereof I have heard him speak, for the purpose of explaining matters to\r\nthe Secretary.\r\n\r\nConnected with this matter of salary, and as having a natural\r\npropinquity to the subject, I may here cursorily, for I design to be\r\nmore particular on this point hereafter, claim the privilege to enter a\r\nlittle into the family matters of my patron. And on this head, I would\r\nobserve that the household of Mr. Flam is large. Of a truth, as some\r\nphilosopher has remarked, mouths are not fed, nor bodies clad, without\r\nconsiderable of the wherewithal! There is Mrs. Flam, the venerated\r\nconsort of our representative--a lady most honorably conducive to the\r\nmultiplication of the strength and glory of this land; there is,\r\nlikewise, Mr. Flam's sister Janet--truly an honor to her sex for\r\ninstructive discourse and exemplary life; and there is Master Middleton,\r\nJunior, with his four sisters and three brothers, who may be all\r\nranged into the semblance of a step-ladder. Great is Mr. Flam's\r\nparental tenderness toward this happy progeny--the reduplication and\r\nretriplication, if I may so express it, of himself and their respectable\r\nmamma. Yielding to the solicitude inspired by this tenderness, almost\r\nthe first thing which our representative did, after the establishment of\r\nthe bank--the means having thereby come the better to his hand--was to\r\nsend Master Middleton, Junior, who was very urgent in his entreaties to\r\nthat point, to Europe, that the young gentleman, by two or three years\r\ntravel, might witness the distresses and oppressions of monarchical\r\ngovernment, and become confirmed in his democratic sentiments. A\r\nrefinement of sensibility in Mr. Flam, which I might almost denominate\r\nfastidious, has also operated with him to require the education of his\r\ndaughters to be conducted under his own roof. He would never hear, for\r\none moment, any persuasion to trust them, even at their earliest age, in\r\nthe public school--considerately fearful lest they might form intimacies\r\nunbecoming the station to which he destined them in after-life. They\r\nhave consequently been placed under the special tuition of a most\r\nestimable lady, Mademoiselle Jonquille, a resident governess, who is\r\nenjoined to speak to them nothing but French. This lady, among other\r\nthings, teaches them music, and is aided in the arduous duties allotted\r\nto her by a drawing-master of acknowledged ability in water-colors, and\r\na very superior professor of dancing, who instructs them in the elegant\r\naccomplishment of waltzing and galloping, which, Mr. Flam says, is\r\nnow-a-days held to be indispensable in the first Democratic circles at\r\nWashington, where it has always been his design to introduce the young\r\nladies into high life.\r\n\r\nIt will not be out of place here to mention that the worthy subject of\r\nthis desultory memoir, my patron and former pupil, inherited a large\r\nfortune from his father, the late Judge Flam, who was especially honored\r\nby old John Adams, or, as the better phrase is, the elder Adams, with an\r\nappointment to the bench on the night of the third of March, Anno Domini\r\n1801; and I have often heard Mr. Middleton say that his father had, up\r\nto the day of his lamented departure from this world, which melancholy\r\nevent happened in the year of our Lord 1825, the greatest respect for\r\nGeneral Jackson; which liking for the Old Hero descended to his son,\r\nalong with the family estate, and serves satisfactorily to account for\r\nmy former pupil's ardent attachment to Democratic principles, as in the\r\nsequel I shall make appear.\r\n\r\nI do not desire to conceal the fact that Judge Flam, and even Mr.\r\nMiddleton himself, for some years after he came to man's estate, were\r\nboth reputed to belong to what was generally, at that time, denominated\r\nand known by the appellation of the Old Federal party, and what, in\r\ncommon parlance, has been sometimes scoffingly termed The Black Cockade;\r\nand that the Judge, who was always noted for being very stiff in his\r\nopinions, maintained his connection nominally with that party until the\r\nday of his death. I mention this not in derogation of Mr. Middleton our\r\nrepresentative, but rather in the way of commendation, because I am by\r\nthis fact the more strongly confirmed in my admiration of the greatness\r\nof his character--seeing that his conversion to Democracy is the pure\r\nresult of reflection and conviction, which is more laudable, in my\r\nhumble thinking, than to be \"a born veteran Democrat,\" as I once heard a\r\ngreat man boast himself.\r\n\r\nNow this conversion being a notable matter, I can by no means pretermit\r\na veritable account of it, which happens to be fully within my power to\r\ndisclose, I being, as I may say, a witness to the whole course of it.\r\n\r\nEverybody remembers that most signal of all the literary productions of\r\nGeneral Jackson's various and illustrious pen, his letter to Mr. Monroe,\r\ndated the 12th of November, Anno Domini 1816. It came--in the language\r\nof my venerated friend, Judge Flam--like the sound of a trumpet upon the\r\nears of all of the Old Federalists. \"Now is the time,\" says General\r\nJackson, in that immortal letter, which I transcribed, as soon as I saw\r\nit in print, into my book of memorable things, and which I now quote\r\n_verbatim et literatim_:--\r\n\r\n     \"Now is the time to exterminate that monster called Party Spirit.\r\n     By selecting characters most conspicuous for their probity, virtue,\r\n     capacity, and firmness, without any regard to party, you will go\r\n     far to, if not entirely, eradicate those feelings which, on former\r\n     occasions, threw so many obstacles in the way, and perhaps have the\r\n     pleasure and honor of uniting a people heretofore politically\r\n     divided. The Chief Magistrate of a great and powerful nation should\r\n     never indulge in party feelings. His conduct should be liberal and\r\n     disinterested, always bearing in mind that he acts for the whole,\r\n     and not a part of the community.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter of the last of the Romans was published in the National\r\nIntelligencer, and I happened to be with Judge Flam when it first met\r\nhis eye. He was sipping his tea. The venerable Judge read it twice; took\r\nup the cup, and, in a musing, thoughtful mood, burnt his mouth with the\r\nhot liquid so badly that he was obliged to call for cold water.--Just at\r\nthat moment, Middleton, his son, came into the parlor: he had been out\r\nshooting partridges.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Middleton, read that,\" said the Judge.\r\n\r\nMiddleton sat down and read it; and then looked intently at his father,\r\nwaiting to hear what he would say.\r\n\r\n\"Middleton, my son,\" said he in a very deliberate and emphatic manner,\r\n\"There's our man. General Jackson has been called a Hero--he's a Sage, a\r\nwise man, a very wise man. _We_ have been kept in the mire too long:\r\nthese Jeffersons and Madisons, and Nicholases and Randolphs, and all\r\nthat Virginia Junto (I think that was the very word he used) have\r\ntrodden us in the dust. They, with all the Democracy at their back, have\r\nlorded it over us for sixteen years. We owe them an old grudge. _But our\r\ntime is coming_, (this expression he repeated twice.) Remember, my son,\r\nif ever you get into a majority, stick to it. Bring up your children to\r\nit. You have a long account to settle:--_I shall bequeath to you the\r\nVengeance of the Federal party_. We must rally at once upon Andrew\r\nJackson. He will bring _us_ what it is fashionable to call 'the\r\npeople.'--We shall bring _him_ the talent, the intelligence, and the\r\npatriotism of the land. In such an alliance how can it be otherwise but\r\nthat we shall have all the power?--and then, if we fail to play our\r\ncards with skill, we shall deserve to lose the game. Let Jackson be our\r\ncandidate for the next Presidency, and let our gathering word be, in the\r\nsentiment of this memorable letter, 'The Union of the People and the\r\nextermination of the Monster of Party.' Do not slumber, my son, but give\r\nyour energies to this great enterprise.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Middleton took this advice of his venerable father greatly to heart.\r\n\"Up with Jackson, and down with Party!\" said he, after a long\r\nrumination; \"good, excellent--nothing can be better!\" And several times\r\nthat night, before he went to bed, he audibly uttered the same words, as\r\nhe walked backward and forward across the room.\r\n\r\nFrom this time Judge Flam wrote many letters to his friends, disclosing\r\nthe views he had expressed to Middleton; and by degrees the matter\r\nripened and ripened, until things were so contrived as to bring\r\nabout what Judge Flam used to smile and say, was \"a spontaneous,\r\nunpremeditated burst of popular feeling,\" in the nomination of the\r\nGeneral. And the Judge used to laugh outright, when the papers took\r\nstrong ground in the General's favor, as the candidate who was brought\r\nout \"without intrigue or party management.\" The Old Hero and Sage, we\r\nall know, was cheated out of his first election; which circumstance\r\ngreatly embittered his early friends, who, from that time--Mr. Middleton\r\namong the rest--took a very decided stand for Reform, Retrenchment,\r\nEconomy, and the Rights of the People.\r\n\r\nThe Judge did not live to witness this second effort which resulted so\r\ngloriously for the Democratic cause; but his son stuck close to the Old\r\nHero, and was among his most ardent supporters to the last. When the\r\nGeneral succeeded, his first care was to show his gratitude to that\r\ndisinterested band of patriots who so freely surrendered their old\r\nprinciples and abandoned their old comrades in his behalf. _He_ brought\r\n_them_ into office, just to show that he was determined to carry out the\r\ndoctrine of his letter; and _they_ were loudest in their praise of _him_\r\nfor the sake of the _old grudge_, of which Judge Flam spoke to his son,\r\nand to indemnify their long suffering in the cause of the country, in\r\nthe course of which they had, for so many years, been strangers to\r\npower. So between these two persuasions, it is not to be wondered at\r\nthat they should have become the principal friends and most confidential\r\nadvisers of the General.\r\n\r\nHaving thus got upon an elevation, from whence they could look\r\nbackward upon their past errors, and forward to their future hopes, a\r\nnew light dawned upon every man of them; and thereupon they straightway\r\nbecame sick and sorry for having so long sinned against Democracy, and\r\ngrew ashamed of that black cockade which George Washington wore in the\r\nRevolution; made open renunciation of their former pretended attachment\r\nto his principles; canonized Mr. Jefferson as a saint, whom they had\r\nformerly reviled as the chief of sinners; purged out their old Federal\r\nblood; took deep alterative draughts of detergent medicine; and,\r\nfinally, like true patriots, came forth regenerated, thorough-bred\r\nwhole-hog Democrats, sworn to follow the new Democratic principle\r\nthrough all its meanderings, traverses, dodgings, and duckings to the\r\nend. Indeed, Mr. Middleton Flam, our honorable representative, has more\r\nthan once, in some of his later speeches before the people, contended,\r\nthat although his father was attached to George Washington's school of\r\npolitics, which, as he remarked, naturally arose out of the prejudices\r\ncreated by the revolutionary war--in which the old Judge had served as a\r\nsoldier--yet, that he, Middleton, never was truly an admirer of that\r\ngentleman's theory of government or system of measures--but, on the\r\ncontrary, held them in marked disesteem, and from his earliest youth had\r\na strong inclination toward that freedom from restraint, which, in man\r\nand boy, is the best test of the new Democratic principle. In proof of\r\nthis tendency of his youthful opinions, he mentioned, with most\r\nadmirable effect, an exploit, in which, when not more than twelve\r\nyears of age, he gallantly stood up at the head of a party of his\r\nschool-fellows to bar out the tutor and take a holiday, on the ground of\r\nthe indefeasible rights of man, with a view to attend a great political\r\nmeeting of the friends of Jefferson, just previous to the second\r\nelection of that Apostle of Democracy.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, our distinguished member of Congress is now, by force\r\nof reflection and conviction, as pure, unadulterated, and, as our people\r\njocularly denote it, as patent a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat as Theodore\r\nFog himself, whose attachment to popular principles, habits, and\r\nmanners, and whose unalterable adhesion to the new Democratic theory,\r\nare written in every line of his face and in every movement of his\r\nbody:--and so, Mr. Flam avers, is every one of his black-cockade friends\r\nwho have got an office. \"Thus it is,\"--if I may be allowed to quote a\r\nbeautiful sentiment from one of Fog's speeches--\"thus it is, that by\r\ndegrees, the errors of old opinions are washed out by the all-pervading\r\nablution of the Democratic principle following in the footsteps of the\r\nmarch of intellect; and so true is it, that the body politic, like\r\nquicksilver, regurgitates and repudiates the feculence of Federalism.\"\r\n\r\nNicodemus Handy has an attachment for Mr. Flam, which is truly\r\nfraternal. It goes so far as to prevent him from ever contradicting Mr.\r\nMiddleton in any fact, or gainsaying him in any opinion--although I did\r\nthink at one time, when Nicodemus was thought to be rich, that he was a\r\nlittle bold in his sentiments on two or three matters wherein our member\r\ndiffered from him. One I remember in particular; it was when the Old\r\nHero pocketed the Specie Circular Bill. Mr. Handy thought, for a little\r\nwhile, that the circular was too hard upon the banks and the trading\r\npeople, and he seemed to insinuate that the General was rather cornered\r\nby Congress, when they ordered its repeal by two-thirds of both Houses;\r\nand that, consequently, as a good Democrat, he ought to have submitted\r\nto the will of the people in that matter, and allowed them to have the\r\nlaw after it was passed. Mr. Flam was diametrically opposed to him, and\r\nproved, I thought conclusively, that, according to the sound\r\nQuodlibetarian Democratic principle, the General was altogether right in\r\nputting the act of Congress aside and not allowing them to overset his\r\nplans by another vote of two-thirds. \"For,\" he inquired with great force\r\nof argument, adopting the Socratic form, \"what is Congress? The\r\nrepresentatives of the people, by districts and by States. For whom can\r\nany one man in that body speak? For his own district, or for his own\r\nState--no more. Now, what is the President? Sir,\" said he, in that\r\nsolemn and impressive tone in which he addresses the House at\r\nWashington, \"the President himself has answered that question in his\r\nimmortal Protest against the Senate--he is '_the direct representative\r\nof the American people_,' and, as he took occasion once to say in his\r\nMessage, '_It will be for those in whose behalf we all act, to decide\r\nwhether the Executive Department of the Government, in the steps which\r\nit has taken on this subject, has been found in the line of its duty_.'\r\nThe President, sir, is the representative of the _whole_ people--not of\r\na district, not of a State, but of the _whole_ nation. Why should\r\nthese representatives of _the parts_ undertake to dictate to the\r\nrepresentative of _the whole_? It is for the people to decide whether,\r\nin putting that bill in his pocket, he was in the line of his duty. Sir,\r\nthere is the broad buttress upon which the Democratic principle reposes,\r\nand will repose forever. Jackson has determined, as representative of\r\nthe people, that the Specie Circular shall not be repealed, and every\r\ntrue Democrat will of course say that he is right. I am surprised that\r\nyou, Handy, should give any countenance to the factious doctrine set up\r\nby the Whigs, that Congress has a right to array itself against the\r\nclearly expressed will of the people, when uttered through the paramount\r\nrepresentative of the whole nation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Handy was evidently confounded by this unanswerable argument, and,\r\nof course, did not attempt to answer. I confess, for my own part, I\r\nlistened with admiration and amazement at the dialectic skill with which\r\nso abstruse a subject was so briefly yet so clearly elucidated, and I\r\ninwardly ejaculated, in the language of the afflicted man of Uz, \"How\r\nforcible are right words!\"\r\n\r\nMy late pupil's reflections were drawn to this question of the Specie\r\nCircular with more intensity of regard, from a very natural train of\r\ncircumstances, which had great influence in inducing an elaborate study\r\nof the subject. Mr. Handy has often said that Mr. Flam was the very best\r\ncustomer our bank had from the beginning. Acting, as he always did, upon\r\nthe principle that our first care is due to those who are nearest to us,\r\nor, according to the adage, that charity begins at home, the President\r\nof the bank refused to borrow from any other institution, but determined\r\nexclusively to patronize his own. This principle he carried to the\r\nromantic extent of borrowing four times as much as anybody else; and as\r\nhe always contended for it as the most approved theorem in banking, that\r\nthe wider and the more remote the circulation of the paper of a bank,\r\nthe better for its profit, he employed these funds in the purchase of a\r\nlarge quantity of the Chickasaw Reserve lands. By these means Mr. Flam\r\nbecame the proprietor of a vast number of acres in that Southwest\r\ncountry; and as the Specie Circular was a most laudable contrivance to\r\nstop overtrading and speculating in the public lands, it occurred to our\r\nworthy representative that the less the public lands were sold, the more\r\nhis would come into the market at good prices; and so, with a view to\r\nthe benefit of Quodlibet, where he expected to invest the profits, he\r\nbecame a strong advocate of the Circular. This set him to studying the\r\nquestion of the pocketing of the bill for its repeal, whereof I have\r\nspoken above, and enabled him to convince himself how deeply that matter\r\nwas connected with the development of the Democratic principle in the\r\nmanner put forth in his argument to Mr. Handy.\r\n\r\nThus does it come to pass that, step by step, as our government rolls\r\non, its fundamental features are successively disclosed in the practical\r\noperations of that sublime system which so securely intrenches the good\r\nof the people in the doctrines of genuine Quodlibetarian Democracy, as\r\nnow of late, for the first time, fully understood and practiced.\r\n\r\nEver after that notable discourse, Mr. Handy showed himself, both in\r\nprivate and at our public meetings, the stern, uncompromising champion\r\nof the Specie Circular and of the broad representative character of the\r\nPresident. The other questions upon which I have found him to differ\r\noccasionally with Mr. Flam, shared pretty nearly the same fate as this.\r\nThe Cashier ultimately fell into entire harmony of sentiment in all\r\nmatters with the President; though, as I have insinuated before, in the\r\nflood-tide of Mr. Handy's fortune, when he began to be accounted a man\r\nof wealth, he was, in accordance with a principle of human nature\r\nfounded upon the corrupting and debasing influence of riches, much more\r\ndifficult to bring into perfect conformity of opinion with Mr. Flam,\r\nthan in the ebb. Yet, I would here remark that, almost in the same\r\ndegree that Mr. Handy yielded his assent to the doctrines of the Hon.\r\nMiddleton Flam, did the rank and file of our sturdy and independent\r\nDemocracy yield to Mr. Handy; the whole party being kept in a harmonious\r\nagreement and accord by what Fog terms \"the electric diffusion of the\r\nDemocratic principle through the whole circle of hand-in-hand,\r\nunflinching, unwavering, uncorruptible, and power-frowning-down yeomanry\r\nof the most virtuous and enlightened nation upon the terrestrial globe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  FURTHER DISCOURSE RELATING TO THE HON. MIDDLETON\r\n     FLAM--CORRECTION IN THE ORTHOGRAPHY OF HIS FAMILY SEAT--HIS\r\n     RESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE--VERY ORIGINAL VIEWS ENTERTAINED\r\n     BY HIM ON THIS SUBJECT--HIS LIBERALITY IN MONEY\r\n     MATTERS--AVERSION TO THE LAW REGARDING INTEREST--DEMOCRATIC\r\n     VIEW OF THAT QUESTION--HIS ENCOURAGEMENT OF INDUSTRY AND\r\n     THE WORKING PEOPLE--INGENIOUS AND PROFOUND ILLUSTRATION OF\r\n     THE GREAT DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHolding, as I do, our Democratic leader, the Hon. Middleton Flam, in\r\nthe most deservedly profound respect, and knowing him to be, if I may be\r\nallowed the expression, a bright exemplar of Democracy, and containing\r\nin himself, metaphorically speaking, the epitome of all sound opinions,\r\nI am fully authorized by the common usage regarding public characters to\r\nbring him and his affairs conspicuously into the view of the world, not\r\nfor censure, neither for praise, although no man is better entitled to\r\nthe latter, but for instruction. Such is the destiny of distinguished\r\nmen, that their lives are common property for the teaching of their\r\ngeneration. Duly acknowledging the weight of this maxim, I shall venture\r\nin the present chapter to give my reader a still closer insight into the\r\nprivate concerns of our representative; for which task I feel myself\r\nsomewhat specially qualified, through the bountiful hospitality of that\r\nexcellent gentleman, who has not only welcomed me to his board often on\r\nweek days, and always on Sundays, but who has even flattered me, more\r\nthan once, by the remark that he would not take umbrage at such\r\nimpartial development of his life and opinions as he knew I, better than\r\nany other of his friends, (truly herein his kindness has overrated my\r\nworthiness,) had it in my power to make.\r\n\r\nThe old family seat of the Flams is about two miles from Quodlibet. It\r\nis upon the Bickerbray road; and, taking in all the grounds belonging to\r\nthe domicile, the tract is somewhere about eight hundred acres; by far\r\nthe greater portion of which is a flat range of woodland and field,\r\nwatered by Grasshopper Run, which falls into the Rumblebottom. The tract\r\nused to be called, in Judge Flam's time, \"The Poplar Flats,\" and the\r\nhouse, at that day, went by the name of \"Quality Hall:\" but ever since\r\nMr. Middleton has had it, which, as may be gathered from what I have\r\nimparted in the last chapter, has been from the time that the old Black\r\nCockades began to think of turning Democrats; ever since that day the\r\nspelling has been gradually changing, and the house now goes by the\r\nsettled name of \"Equality Hall,\" and the tract is always written by our\r\npeople \"The Popular Flats.\" Mr. Middleton greatly approves of this\r\nchange, for two reasons which he has had occasion to take into his\r\nserious reflections--First; \"Because,\" he says, \"in the Quodlibetarian\r\nDemocratic system, as now understood, words are things.\" \"Not only\r\nthings, sir,\" said he, in a discourse one day, at his own table, \"but\r\nimportant and valuable things. I have observed,\" he continued, \"in our\r\ncountry, especially among the unflinching, uncompromising Democrats,\r\nthat a name is always half the battle. For instance, sir, we wish to\r\ndestroy the bank; we have only to call it a Monster: we desire to put\r\ndown an opposition ticket, and keep the offices among ourselves; all\r\nthat we have to do is to set up a cry of Aristocracy. If we want to stop\r\na canal, we clamor against Consolidation: if we wish it to go on, it is\r\nonly to change the word--Develop the Resources. When it was thought\r\nworth our while to frighten Calhoun with the notion that we were going\r\nto hang him, we hurraed for the Proclamation; and after that, when we\r\nwanted to gain over his best friends to our side--State-Rights was the\r\nword. Depend upon it, gentlemen, with the true Quodlibetarian Democracy,\r\nnames are things: that is the grand secret of the 'New-Light system.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Flam's second reason for approving the change in the spelling of\r\nPoplar Flats and Quality Hall, did not depend upon such a philosophical\r\nsubtlety as the first; it was simply because he had very nigh lost his\r\nfirst election to Congress from inattention to this material point of\r\northography. Quality Hall, some of the Democrats of our region were\r\nunreasonable and headstrong enough to say, was not so Democratic a name\r\nas their candidate ought to have for his place of residence; and if it\r\nhad not been that our representative discovered this in time to convince\r\nthem that it was an old-fashioned way of spelling Equality Hall, I\r\nbelieve, in my conscience, he would have made out very badly: but\r\nluckily for this district, and I may say, for the nation, this error in\r\nspelling was corrected in time to set all straight; and Mr. Flam, from\r\nthat day, not only put the E before the Q, but, in token of that\r\nincident, and by way of a remembrancer, always spoke of Equality Hall as\r\nbuilt upon Popular Flats, which sounded very well in the ears of the New\r\nLights, and no doubt went a great way to keep him in Congress ever\r\nafter. Therefore I repeat, after my patron and friend, words _are_\r\nthings;--and, democratically speaking, in the sense of a New Light, I\r\nmight even say _better_ than things.\r\n\r\nEquality Hall is a building which looks larger than it is, from the\r\ncircumstance that it was originally a one-storied, irregular cottage of\r\nbrick, but in the Judge's time a second story was put to it; and, almost\r\nimmediately after Mr. Middleton came to be the owner, he enlarged the\r\neastern gable by widening it to nearly forty feet, and building it up\r\nconsiderably above the roof, and then adding to it a grand Grecian\r\nTemple porch with niches for statues, and with fluted Doric columns of\r\nwood, which thus constituted what Mr. Middleton calls his facade and\r\nprincipal front to the building. The effect of this piece of\r\nmagnificence was to screen the old-cottage from view, and to impress the\r\nbeholder with the idea of a grand building peeping out upon the\r\nBickerbray road between the foliage of two weeping willows, which the\r\nold Judge put there before Mr. Jefferson's election.\r\n\r\nI have heard some fastidious, not to say malevolent critics, find\r\nfault with this new addition to the building, upon the score that it had\r\ntoo much pretense about it; and that one was always disappointed upon\r\nfinding all this grandeur of outside to be but a mere piece of\r\ntheatrical show, without having anything to correspond to it within. Mr.\r\nFlam has heard the same objection, but he has always treated it with the\r\ncontempt it deserved. \"It _was_ intended for show,\" he observed one day\r\naddressing the people from the hustings, when he had occasion to notice\r\na remark of one of these caviling gentlemen, who had said something\r\nabout having walked behind the portico to find the house--and I\r\nshall never forget how his eye kindled and his form dilated as he\r\nspoke--\"Show, sir! Of course, it was put there for show. What else could\r\nit be put for? What is any portico put up for? It faces toward the road,\r\nsir--it was designed to face toward the road. When I built that portico,\r\nI wished the people, sir, to see it; the best I have shall always be\r\nshown to the people. I trust, sir, that my respect for the people shall\r\nnever so far abate, as to induce me to neglect _them_. My house, sir,\r\nintrinsically is that of an humble citizen; there are a dozen equal to\r\nit in this county; but that part of it which is intended to gratify the\r\npeople is unsurpassed here or anywhere else. I have laid out, sir, a\r\nsmall fortune on that portico to gratify the people: all that I have\r\ncomes from them--all that I ever expect to be, I hope to derive from\r\nthem: who has so good a right as they to require me to put my best foot\r\nforemost, when they are the spectators? On the same principle, sir, when\r\nI appear in public, I dress in the most expensive attire, I drive the\r\nbest horses, and procure the finest coach. My turnout is altogether\r\nelaborate, studiously particular--simply because I hold the people in\r\ntoo much esteem, to shab them off with anything of a secondary quality,\r\nwhile Providence has blessed me with the means of providing them the\r\nbest. That, sir, is what I call a keystone principle in the arch of\r\nDemocratic government: that is the sentiment, and that alone, which is\r\nto give perpetuity to this----\"\r\n\r\n\"Fair fabric of freedom,\" said Theodore Fog, who was among the auditory,\r\nand perceived that Mr. Flam hesitated for a word to convey his idea.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, my friend,\" courteously replied Mr. Flam, \"I am indebted to\r\nyou for the word--fair fabric of freedom.\"\r\n\r\nComing back from this digression, which I have the rather indulged\r\nbecause of the eloquence, as well as the just Democratic sentiment it\r\nbreathes, I proceed with my sketch of the homestead of our distinguished\r\nleader of the politics of Quodlibet.\r\n\r\nIf I were asked what constituted the most striking feature in the\r\narrangements of this very admirable establishment, I should say it was\r\nthe judicious admixture of a laudable economy, with the greatest\r\npossible effect in the way of outward exhibition. For instance, the\r\ngrounds were embellished with sundry structures, apparently at great\r\ncost, and producing a most satisfactory impression on the eye, but\r\nwhich, when examined, would be found to be, for the most part, painted\r\nimitations of a very cheap kind. Thus there was to be seen from the\r\nportico, peering above a thicket on the Grasshopper Run, an old castle\r\nwith ivy-crowned battlements, greatly enriching the view; at the end of\r\nthe long walk in the garden, a magnificent obelisk rose forty feet above\r\na bed of asparagus; the entrance to the stable-yard was through the\r\nGothic archway of an old chapel, exceeding pleasant to behold; and the\r\nice pond was guarded by a palisade composed of muskets, lances, swords,\r\nshields, and cannon, flanked at each end by a pile of drums and colors.\r\nAll these several embellishments a nice observation would determine to\r\nbe executed in oil painting, upon wooden screens sawed into the\r\nrequisite figures. But even this expense would, perhaps, have been\r\navoided, had it not been that Quipes, our artist, owed Mr. Flam\r\ntwenty-five dollars on account of a debt which Mr. Flam had to pay for\r\nhim, to get him out of jail, for the sake of his vote, when we first\r\nelected our public-spirited representative to Congress. Owing to this\r\ncircumstance, connected with the fact that Sam Hardesty, the joiner,\r\nbecame insolvent on his contract for building the big portico, whereby\r\nMr. Flam was obliged to advance money to him in order to get it\r\nfinished, our member conceived that it would be a good plan to work\r\nthese debts out of his two friends, by setting them about the\r\ndecorations I have described. Besides, he reasoned with himself that it\r\nwas always well to give employment to the working people about him, with\r\na view to encourage industry and afford a practical illustration of the\r\nbenignant influence of the great Democratic principle upon society--a\r\nconsideration which Mr. Flam on no occasion ever permitted himself to\r\nlose sight of. By this judicious management he accomplished a fourfold\r\npurpose: namely, the beautifying of Popular Flats; the execution of\r\nthese rich specimens of art, at less than half their value; the\r\nemployment of two very meritorious fragments of the people; and, above\r\nall, a most satisfactory development of the excellence and usefulness of\r\nthe great New-Light Democratic principle.\r\n\r\nMr. Flam never was what you might call a moneyed man. For although his\r\nfarms were very productive, and he had a considerable income from stock\r\nin the United States Bank; and although the expenses of his family were\r\nvery far short of what the world might, from the show he made, suppose\r\nthem to be; yet he was in the habit of parting with his money as fast as\r\nit came to hand. There were a great number of deserving but needy\r\npersons who were often at the Popular Flats, and who did not hesitate to\r\nborrow all the funds Mr. Flam could spare, (if he had a fault it was the\r\ngenerosity of his lendings,) and in this way to keep him, as he has\r\noften told me himself, very bare. To make sure against loss he had the\r\nprudence never to lend without bond and mortgage, with a power of\r\nattorney to confess judgment; and as he ever avowed what he called his\r\nmost irrevocable opinion, that the interest law was exceedingly\r\noppressive upon the industry of the country, he invariably made his own\r\nbargain on that point--sagaciously remarking, as I once heard him to\r\nNicholas Hardup, the cattle dealer, who was under execution upon a\r\njudgment, and came to borrow the amount from Mr. Flam, \"Money, sir, is a\r\ncommodity like wheat or cattle; its value is regulated by the relations\r\nof supply and demand. Society will never prosper till that principle is\r\nuniversally recognized. _We_ go for it, Mr. Hardup, as cardinal in the\r\nDemocratic creed. Labor, to be free, requires that the money contract\r\nalso should be free. Why should the poor man pay six per cent. when\r\nmoney is worth but five? Why should he be prevented paying seven, eight,\r\nor nine, even, if he finds it his interest to give it--or cannot do\r\nwithout it? No, sir, Equal Rights, Liberty of Conscience, and\r\nUnrestricted Freedom of Contract--there is the buttress of Democratic\r\ngovernment!\"\r\n\r\nIt often happened, as such things will happen, that Mr. Flam became the\r\nloser by his generosity; and as it was a maxim with him to inculcate the\r\nmost rigid punctuality in all engagements, he has never felt himself at\r\nliberty to relax what he regarded this salutary rule; so that, on many\r\noccasions, he has been compelled to submit to the unpleasant and\r\nexpensive operation of closing his accounts on the bond and mortgage, by\r\ntaking possession of the mortgaged property; and in this way, as he\r\nsometimes feelingly complains to his friends, he has become encumbered\r\nwith more land than he knows what to do with. He has, however, gradually\r\ngot through a great deal of this trouble by renting out his farms; a\r\ncourse which he intends to persevere in until his children are able to\r\ntake the management of them.\r\n\r\nMr. Handy has several times endeavored to persuade him to make\r\nhis improvements rather more permanent, and to take down these\r\nembellishments I have been describing; rather rashly as I thought,\r\ncalling them, to Mr. Flam's face, pasteboard scenery, gingerbread\r\nnonsense, and twopenny gimcracks: and he insinuated that if our worthy\r\nrepresentative would lay out some of his \"accommodation\" in a more solid\r\nmanner upon Popular Flats, it would tell hereafter to his advantage. But\r\nMr. Flam turns a deaf ear to all Nicodemus's preaching. He says that the\r\naccommodation is better laid out in the Chickasaw Reserve, where he\r\nmeans to realize a large fortune; and as to what Mr. Handy is pleased to\r\ncall _gimcracks_ and _gingerbread_, that, in fact, is the only kind of\r\ndecoration in which a man, who respects the simplicity and purity of\r\nDemocratic government, ought to indulge his taste. \"If,\" said he, \"my\r\nold castle, my obelisk, or my Gothic gateway were built of stone instead\r\nof white pine, a fair inference might be made against me of a lurking\r\nwish to restore the exploded aristocratic system of primogeniture and\r\nentails. It would be said I was building for my son and his eldest born.\r\nThank God, no such treasonable design can be inferred from this\r\n_gimcrack_ and _gingerbread_, as you wittily term it. When I go, sir, my\r\nestate is to be cut up as our Democratic republican laws ordain; and my\r\ngimcrack and gingerbread can be plowed in as easily as the dockweed.\r\nStrange as it may sound to the ears of some, gimcrack and gingerbread\r\nare the elements of our new Democratic theory. Sir, our government\r\nshould glory in it:--it does glory in it. There is no reproach in the\r\nfact that we neither build, legislate, think, nor determine for the next\r\ngeneration. We attend to _ourselves_--that is genuine New-Light\r\nDemocracy. We oppose Vested Rights, we oppose Chartered Privileges, we\r\noppose Pledges to bind future Legislatures, we oppose Tariffs, Internal\r\nImprovements, Colleges, and Universities, on the broad Democratic ground\r\nthat we have nothing to do with Posterity. Posterity will be as free as\r\nwe are. Let it take care of itself. I glory, sir, in saying New-Light\r\nDemocracy riots in gimcrack and gingerbread.\"\r\n\r\nThis eloquent outburst of sentiment effectually silenced Mr. Handy,\r\nand brought him thoroughly into Mr. Flam's opinion. I rejoice that my\r\nintimacy with this able statesman should have afforded me this\r\nopportunity to show the brilliancy with which his mind sparkles in the\r\ndemonstration of political truth, and the wonderful power with which it\r\nconverts apparently trivial thoughts into golden illustrations of the\r\nDemocratic theory as lately discovered and practiced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  THE SECOND ERA--POPULATION OF QUODLIBET--INCREASE UNPARALLELED\r\n     IN ANCIENT CITIES; EQUALED ONLY BY MILWAUKEE, ETC.--SUCCESS\r\n     OF THE BANK--ATTACK UPON IT IN CONGRESS--THE HON. MIDDLETON\r\n     FLAM'S TRIUMPHANT VINDICATION--SKETCH OF HIS CELEBRATED\r\n     SPEECH BEFORE THE NEW LIGHTS--INIMITABLE IRONY ON THE\r\n     DIVORCE OF GOVERNMENT AND BANK--MERITED COMPLIMENT TO THE\r\n     HEAD OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY--THAT DISTINGUISHED\r\n     GENTLEMAN'S OPINIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is no part of my design in the compilation of this little history to\r\npreserve the form of a regular, chronological narrative of the course of\r\nevents in Quodlibet; for although the material for such a continuous\r\nrecital abounds in the memoranda which I have preserved, yet it seems\r\nbetter to suit the purpose of the respectable committee who have invoked\r\nme to this labor, that I should rather make excerpts from the mass of my\r\npapers, in such wise as to bring before my reader the condition of the\r\nBorough at several epochs, with an occasional reference to such\r\nincidents as may serve to explain the opinions of our people and\r\nillustrate the course of that beautiful system of politics which the\r\nworld--I mean that world of which our Borough is the center--has\r\nconsented to honor with the epithet of Quodlibetarian; and in which\r\ndesignation, in my poor judgment, is comprehended the essence of the\r\ntrue theory by which this nation has advanced to its present\r\nunparalleled state of prosperity and grandeur.\r\n\r\nFollowing this suggestion, I propose now to lead my reader to that epoch\r\nin the annals of the Borough which dates in the fourth year after the\r\nRemoval, or, in the vernacular computation, the year of 1836-7. The\r\npopulation of Quodlibet had now reached to the astonishing amount of\r\nfifteen hundred and eighty odd souls--the increase being altogether\r\nwithout an example in the history of civilization, excepting, perhaps,\r\nin that of Milwaukee, Navarino, and some other of those seemingly\r\nincredible and fabulous creations of art which are said to have sprung\r\nup under the beneficent auspices of the Quodlibetarian theory, as the\r\nsame has been practiced in this government for some few years past.\r\nQuodlibet, I repeat, had reached in population upwards of fifteen\r\nhundred and eighty inhabitants, as was ascertained by a diligent\r\nenumeration made under the direction of our New-Light Club, with a view\r\nto the election of a constable held this year in the Borough;--and when\r\nwe reflect that at the date of the Removal, the whole settlement fell\r\nshort of two hundred persons all told, it will be perceived that in\r\nthree years our increase has exceeded seven hundred per cent.! Verily,\r\nneither London, Athens, nor Palmyra, Karnac, Luxor, nor even Milwaukee\r\nitself, I doubt, has ever manifested so prolific an augmentation.\r\n\r\nNicodemus Handy's row of stores on the Basin was the first improvement,\r\nas I have already informed my reader; then Copperplate Ridge was studded\r\nwith buildings; at the same time Flam Street was enriched with the bank\r\nand seven brick buildings; then came the Female Lyceum, with the Town\r\nHall in the second story of the same building, Peter Ounce's Boatmen's\r\nHotel on the other side of the Basin, the Hay Scales, Zachary\r\nYounghusband's (the tinplate worker) shop, and Dr. Thomas G. Winkleman's\r\nDruggist Store and Soda Water Pavilion. These, as well as I can\r\nrecollect, were the principal establishments erected in Quodlibet in the\r\nthree years I have referred to. There were a number of private houses\r\nbuilt in this period, and a whole settlement of free negroes made below\r\nthe Basin, on the line of the canal. I ought to mention, too, that\r\nNicodemus Handy this year dug out the foundations, and, I believe, built\r\nthe cellar walls, of a second row of stores and of a new hotel designed\r\non a very large scale, with extensive baths to be attached to it. These\r\nbuildings, it pains me to say, in advance, never got higher than the\r\nfirst story, as I shall be obliged to relate hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe bank did a sweeping business all this time; and nothing can be\r\nconceived more beautiful than the theory upon which it was conducted. It\r\nhas run out of my memory how many new bales of pink silk paper were\r\nturned off by it, but the amount would scarcely be believed if I were to\r\nset it down; and the accommodation principle was carried out to an\r\nextent that must have been truly gratifying to the Secretary. Still,\r\neven this most exemplary institution did not escape the malevolence of\r\nthe Whigs. That ever-complaining party, as the Hon. Middleton Flam\r\nassured us by letter, were making a great ado in Congress about all the\r\nbanks, but particularly about ours--alleging, in their usual factious\r\nmanner, that the government would lose money by us, as well as by the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nDeeming this charge as one of peculiar atrocity, we at once determined\r\nto take it up in our New-Light Club, and stamp upon it the most\r\nconclusive refutation. We accordingly fixed an evening for the\r\ndiscussion, during Christmas week, when we knew that our member would be\r\nat home to visit his family; and he was of course invited to attend and\r\ngive his views upon this very interesting question. The meeting was in\r\nthe Town Hall up stairs above the Female Lyceum. All Quodlibet was\r\npresent. I shall be long thankful to Providence for the dignified\r\nstation which it fell to my lot to fill on that memorable occasion. By a\r\nmost unexpected but most felicitous chance, I was honored that night\r\nwith a call to the chair; the worthy Mr. Snuffers, our President, not\r\nbeing able to attend, in consequence of the interesting condition of\r\nMrs. Snuffers. As the subject of discussion was one of thrilling\r\ninterest, the most intense anxiety prevailed to hear the speech of our\r\neloquent representative. He came fully prepared, bringing with him a\r\nload of documents. Our Vice, Mr. Doubleday, who is a solid thinking,\r\nshrewd person, of that maturity of judgment which it is impossible to\r\nimpose upon, and himself, by-the-by, a first-rate debater, told me,\r\nafter we broke up, that Mr. Flam's discourse that evening on the banking\r\nsystem at large and on the _safety_ of the banks in particular, was one\r\nof the closest pieces of reasoning he had ever listened to in his life.\r\nI regret that I have preserved so imperfect an outline of this speech,\r\nbut such as it is I offer it to my reader.\r\n\r\nThe orator commenced very appropriately by remarking how impossible it\r\nwas, in the nature of things, to satisfy the Whigs on any point. He said\r\nthere were three parties in Congress: First, the Whigs--who still\r\ncroaked about a National Bank--and his description of their croaking was\r\nto the last degree humorous; it produced peals of laughter. Second, the\r\nthorough-going Quodlibetarian Whole Hogs, who were steadfast and\r\nimmovable for the State Banks; and a third party, small in numbers,\r\n\"attenuated\"--as he remarked with irresistibly comic effect--\"and gaunt;\r\nfeeble, shrill, and like crickets who might scarcely be seen in\r\ndaytime;\" and who, when the bill to Regulate the Deposits was up,\r\npresented what, in his opinion, was the most alarming, if it had not\r\nbeen the most ridiculous scheme, in relation to the public money, that\r\nhad ever been hatched in the hotbed of faction. These men, he said\r\ncalled themselves Conservatives: \"And what think you, Mr. President,\" he\r\nasked, \"was _their_ project? It was, sir, to separate the Government\r\nfrom the Banks.\" Here Mr. Flam was interrupted by a loud laugh. \"A Mr.\r\nGordon,\" he said, \"was at the head of this little troop. He proposed a\r\nbill, two sessions ago, to place the revenue and public moneys in the\r\nhands of Receivers--the moneys were to be paid to these Receivers in\r\nGOLD and SILVER! and no bank was to be intrusted with a dollar!! And\r\nthis,\" exclaimed Mr. Flam, with a tone of inimitable irony, \"was to be\r\ndone for the SAFETY of the public Treasure! Your money not safe in the\r\nhands of the banks, but _perfectly secure_ in the keeping of these\r\nhonest Receivers, who were to be furnished with vaults and iron chests\r\nto lock it up in!!! O rare Conservatives!--O wise Conservatives!--O\r\nhonest Conservatives!\"\r\n\r\nWe all thought the ceiling of the Town Hall would have toppled down on\r\nour heads from the laughter occasioned by this sally. In this admirable\r\nstrain he continued for some minutes. At length, taking himself up, and\r\nfalling into a tone of grave expostulation, he pulled out a copy of The\r\nGlobe from his pocket, and proceeded--\r\n\r\n\"Admirably, sir, has this paper which I hold in my hand descanted on\r\nthis most wicked project. These well-timed remarks, I beg leave to read.\r\nHear the incomparable Blair. '_Had such a suggestion_,' says he, '_come\r\nfrom General Jackson, it would have been rung through the Old Dominion\r\nas conclusive proof of all the aspirations which may have been charged\r\nto the Hero of New Orleans. See here, they would say, he wishes to put\r\nthe public money directly into the palms of his friends and partisans,\r\ninstead of keeping it on deposit in banks, whence it cannot be drawn,\r\nfor other than public purposes, without certain detection. In such a\r\ncase, we should feel that the people had just cause for alarm, and ought\r\nto give their most watchful attention to such an effort to enlarge\r\nExecutive power, and put in its hands the means of corruption_.' Most\r\nadmirably again,\" continued Mr. Flam, \"has this same incomparable Blair\r\nsaid, '_The scheme is disorganizing and revolutionary, subversive of the\r\nfundamental principles of our government, and of its practice from 1780\r\ndown to this day_.' Will you, freemen of Quodlibet, gentlemen of The New\r\nLight,\" exclaimed Mr. Flam, \"if faction should go so far as to put this\r\nodious, disorganizing, and revolutionary yoke upon the country, will\r\nyou, freemen of Quodlibet, submit to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" shouted the ready response of sixty-four voices.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, listen to the words of the Old Hero,\" continued Mr. Flam,\r\nwith a gratulatory smile playing on his face, presenting at the same\r\ntime a printed document which he carefully unfolded--\"listen to that\r\n'old man eloquent' whose mouth is never opened but to breathe the\r\nprecepts of wisdom and patriotism:--I read you from his last message. In\r\nremarking upon this absurd project, the President, in this able paper,\r\nholds the following language: '_To retain the Public Revenue in the\r\nTreasury unemployed in any way, is impracticable. It is considered\r\nagainst the genius of our free institutions to lock up in vaults the\r\ntreasure of the nation. Such a treasure would doubtless be employed at\r\nsome time, as it has in other countries, when opportunity tempted\r\nambition._' Now are you willing, men of Quodlibet,\" again ejaculated our\r\neloquent representative, as he slapped the document upon the table, \"are\r\nyou willing, or can you consent to tolerate a proposition which is\r\nagainst the genius----\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" thundered forth sixty-four New Lights again, before our orator had\r\nfinished the sentence.\r\n\r\n\"Order, order, freemen of Quodlibet,\" I called out, as it was my duty to\r\ndo, at this interruption. \"Hear our distinguished representative to an\r\nend, before you respond.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a decorous silence.\r\n\r\n\"A proposition,\" continued Mr. Flam, \"which is against the genius of our\r\nfree institutions, and which would be a lure to tempt ambition to its\r\nmost unholy purposes?\"\r\n\r\nThe club looked at me for a sign, and I, quickly giving a nod of my\r\nhead, a loud \"No\" ran over the whole room, like a _feu de joie_ fired\r\noff at a militia training.\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Flam, \"one word as to the _safety_ of these\r\ndeposits. Whigs--oh that some of you were present, to mark how a plain\r\ntale shall put you down! I have here the Secretary's own report,\" he\r\nadded, as he selected one from the bundle of documents which lay before\r\nhim. \"There is no need for many words here--here is Mr. Secretary\r\nhimself, than whom a more pellucid, diaphanous, transparent Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury--a mind of rock-crystal, a head of sunbeams, a soul, sir,\r\nof pure fountain water, that gurgles and gurgles, perpetually welling\r\nforth its unadulterated intelligence in a purling stream, of which it\r\nmay be said, in the beautiful language of the poet of antiquity\r\n\r\n  'Rusticus expectat dum defluat amnis, at ille\r\n  Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis aevum'\"----\r\n\r\nHere I gave a nod, by way of signal to the club, to applaud this\r\nsplendid outbreak of Ciceronian eloquence; whereat the New Lights\r\nvociferated \"Bravo--three times three!\" and made the house ring with\r\ntheir approbation--\"I say, sir, I have the Secretary himself here\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral of the members, not being accustomed to this parliamentary\r\nlanguage, took the orator literally, and rose to welcome the\r\ndistinguished person referred to; but a word from me explained matters,\r\nand brought the club again to order.\r\n\r\n\"The Secretary, gentlemen New Lights,\" said Mr. Flam, adroitly availing\r\nhimself of the occasion to throw off a coruscation of wit--\"the\r\nSecretary lives _in his reports_--profound, statesmanlike, recondite and\r\ndeep, his report is in my hand--_it is himself!_ I will read you what he\r\nsays upon this matter of the safety of the banks.\"\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Flam read as follows, from a report dated December 12, 1834:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is gratifying to reflect, however, that the credit given by the\r\n     government, whether to bank paper or bank agents, has been\r\n     accompanied by SMALLER LOSSES in the experience under the system of\r\n     State banks in this country, at their worst periods, and under\r\n     their severest calamities, than any other kind of credit\r\n     the government has ever given in relation to its pecuniary\r\n     transactions.\" \"Again,\" he continued, turning to another page, \"it\r\n     is a singular fact, in praise of this description of public\r\n     debtors--the selected banks--that there is not now due, on deposit,\r\n     in the whole of them, which have ever stopped payment, from the\r\n     establishment of the constitution to the present moment, a sum much\r\n     beyond what is now due to the United States from one mercantile\r\n     firm, that stopped payment in 1825 or 1826, and of whom ample\r\n     security was required, and supposed to be taken under the\r\n     responsibility of an oath. If we include the whole present dues to\r\n     the government from discredited banks at all times, and of all\r\n     kinds, whether as depositories or not, and embrace even counterfeit\r\n     bills, and every other species of unavailable funds in the\r\n     treasury, they will not exceed what is due from two such firms. Of\r\n     almost one hundred banks, not depositories, which, during all our\r\n     wars and commercial embarrassments, have heretofore failed, in any\r\n     part of the Union, in debt to the government, on their bills or\r\n     otherwise, it will be seen by the above table (to which Mr. Flam\r\n     referred as annexed to the report) that the whole of them, except\r\n     seventeen, have adjusted everything which they owed, and that the\r\n     balance due from them, without interest, is less than $32,000.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, gentlemen New Lights of Quodlibet,\" said Mr. Flam, when he had\r\nfinished reading these extracts, \"what can be added beyond this\r\ncertificate from the Secretary, of the value of our State banks? Even\r\nthe lips of Whiggism are sealed before it; and nothing is left but the\r\nconfession that, in all their senseless clamor against our favorite and\r\nlong-tried State bank system, the course of its enemies has been but the\r\nebullition of disappointed ambition and peevish discontent. Are you\r\nwilling, I ask, to see this glorious system prostrated to the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" was again the general cry.\r\n\r\n\"Are you content to see your cherished banks stripped of the confidence\r\nof the government?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--never, never!\" shouted the New Lights to a man.\r\n\r\n\"Then, gentlemen Quodlibetarians, radii of the New Lights, you have\r\njustified all my hopes. Your applause rewards all my toils--your support\r\nand confidence enlist all my gratitude. With emotions of heart-felt\r\nsatisfaction, I bid you each good night!\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, this remarkable man gathered up his documents, and,\r\nwith a countenance full of smiles, retired from the midst of this circle\r\nof his devoted--yes, I may say, his idolizing friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  EXCITEMENT PRODUCED BY THE THOROUGH BLUE WHOLE\r\n     TEAM--MEETING OF THE NEW LIGHT--JESSE FERRET'S\r\n     AMBIDEXTERITY--INTRODUCTION OF ELIPHALET FOX TO THE\r\n     CLUB--HIS EXPOSITION OF PRINCIPLES--ESTABLISHMENT OF THE\r\n     QUODLIBET WHOLE HOG.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after the time referred to in the last chapter--that is, when we\r\nwere favored by Mr. Flam with his views on the banking system--there was\r\na question of the most profound interest in agitation, both in the\r\nNew-Light Club and out of it; that question was the establishment of a\r\nnewspaper. The Quodlibetarian Democracy were, I am sorry to inform my\r\nreader, most sorely and wantonly assailed, indeed I may say insulted, by\r\nan hebdomadal sheet which, through the aid, or, more properly speaking,\r\n_the abuse_ of the post-office (for surely it was not the original\r\ndesign of that institution to afford the means of corrupting the people\r\nby the dissemination of such moral poisons) was distributed among sundry\r\nof our citizens, and even put upon the files of one of our public\r\nhouses. I do not scruple to name the house--that of Jesse Ferret--Jesse\r\nbeing at this time a little amphibious in his politics, or, in Mr. Fog's\r\nexpressive language, _rather fishy_. The paper to which I allude was\r\npublished at Thorough Blue Court-House, a perfect hotbed of contumacious\r\nopposition, situate about fifty miles due west from Quodlibet. It was\r\ncalled \"THE THOROUGH BLUE WHOLE TEAM,\" and was edited by Augustus\r\nPostlethwaite Tompkinson, an inchoate lawyer, who had set up for a poet,\r\nand whose sentiments were of the most dangerous Whig complexion. This\r\npaper was constantly filled with extracts of the ravings of Whig members\r\nof Congress against our admirable system of banking, and had gone to\r\nsuch an extreme of rashness, as to denominate that splendid measure of\r\nthe purest and wisest statesman of the age--my reader perceives I mean\r\nMr. Benton--for the introduction of the gold currency, a humbug! But\r\nthis was not all; the unprincipled editor of that reckless journal had\r\nactually so far forgotten all the decencies of civilized society, had\r\nbecome so callous to the cause of virtue and truth, as to launch his\r\npuny thunderbolts at the fair fame of the Hon. Middleton Flam. He was\r\nridiculed as a pretender! he was nicknamed a charlatan!! and the\r\nunbridled license of this unsparing defamer did not stop short of\r\ndenouncing him as a Federalist!!! All Quodlibet--that is, all who\r\npossessed the soul of Quodlibetarians--raised up their hands at the\r\npolitical impiety of this libel. A spontaneous burst of feeling\r\nindicated the deep sentiment which called for immediate action on the\r\nsubject. For a full week, the New Light was in a state of paroxysm. The\r\nclub met every night. Nicodemus Handy was there; Fog was there; Nim\r\nPorter was there; Snuffers and Doubleday, Doctor Winkleman and Zachary\r\nYounghusband, recently appointed postmaster of the Borough, were there.\r\nEvery thorough-bred Quod, even down to Flan. Sucker, was there. Jesse\r\nFerret, I have already said, was fishy. I regret to say it, but it is\r\ntrue. Jesse, bending to the suppleness of the times, and forgetting a\r\npatriot's duty, which is first and foremost above all things to stick to\r\nhis party, pleaded his public calling to excuse his vacillation, and\r\neven went so far as to say that \"a publican should have no politics.\" Oh\r\nshame, where is thy blush! Not so with Nim Porter;--his soul towered\r\nabove the bar-room; he would bet all he was worth on the side of his\r\nparty. Everybody in Quodlibet knows how free Nim always was with his\r\nbets.\r\n\r\nThe decisive meeting of the club took place in the dining-room of\r\nFerret's tavern. Nicodemus Handy did not often attend the meetings of\r\nthe club: we looked to him rather for head work, for he was not the best\r\nof public speakers; but on the night of this assemblage he made it a\r\npoint to be present. Mr. Handy is rather a short, fat man; his head is\r\npartially bald, his face is smooth and fair, his dress was always\r\nremarked for being of the best material, put on in the neatest\r\nmanner--in short, Mr. Handy is a first-rate gentleman. I am particular\r\nin noting these matters, because THE WHOLE TEAM was in the habit of\r\nbragging that \"all the decency\" was on his side. Now I would challenge\r\nThorough Blue Court-House, and the settlement ten miles around it--the\r\nwhole region is Whig--to produce one man among them to compare either\r\nwith the Hon. Middleton Flam or Nicodemus Handy. And I would take this\r\noccasion further to remark, in refutation of THE WHOLE TEAM'S calumny\r\ntouching \"all the decency,\" that the true Quodlibetarian Democrats have\r\nas great a respect for appearance, and as profound a spirit of\r\nassentation and regard toward a man of wealth, as the people of any\r\ncountry upon earth: if anything, our tip-top Quods carry rather a higher\r\nhead than the richest Whigs in these parts, and any dispassionate man\r\nwho will examine into the matter will say so.\r\n\r\nSnuffers was in the chair. The members of the club did not sit down:\r\nthey were too much agitated to sit down. As soon as I, in my character\r\nof Secretary, read the minutes of the preceding meeting, Mr. Handy rose,\r\nand after some very appropriate remarks delivered in a modest fashion,\r\n(in which he assured the club that he was unaccustomed to public\r\nspeaking and moreover oppressed by the intensity of his feelings in\r\nregard to the recent attack on his friend, the Hon. Middleton Flam, and\r\nin a slight degree agitated in the presence of this most respectable\r\nassemblage of Quods,) came at once to the point. \"Who,\" he asked, \"was\r\nAugustus Postlethwaite Tompkinson? His name told you who he was--an\r\naristocrat, a poet, a sentimentalizer, _a dealer in fiction_! What was\r\nhis calling? A pander, a pimp, a professional reviler of great and\r\ngood men. What was his paper? That sink of infamy--THE WHOLE\r\nTEAM--twenty-four by eighteen, with a poet's corner, and an outside\r\nstuffed with a few beggarly advertisements. Would gentlemen submit to be\r\nled by the nose by a thing like that, twenty-four by eighteen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" cried out Flanigan Sucker, who stood in the doorway, just\r\nbehind Nim Porter--\"will we, Nim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence,\" said Mr. Snuffers.\r\n\r\n\"If gentlemen have my feelings of indignation on this subject,\"\r\ncontinued Mr. Handy, \"they will concur with me in establishing a paper\r\nof our own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go it, Nicodemus!\" shouted Flan. Sucker, very indecorously putting in\r\nhis word a second time.\r\n\r\nThereupon arose some confusion in the club, and Flan., being found upon\r\nexamination to be muddled with liquor, was requested to retire; and not\r\nbeing very prompt to obey this invitation, he was turned out.\r\n\r\nMr. Handy then proceeded. \"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"a paper we must have,\r\nand I feel happy in the opportunity to introduce to your acquaintance a\r\ngood friend of our cause, who is here present to-night, and who, under\r\nthe auspices of this club, is willing to undertake the responsible duty\r\nof supplying this so much desiderated object. I beg leave to present to\r\nyou Mr. Eliphalet Fox, a gentleman long connected with the press in a\r\nneighboring State, and who is prepared to submit to you his scheme.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this a stranger, who had been seated in a back part of the room,\r\nwrapped up in a green camlet cloak with plaid lining, which I may add\r\nhad apparently seen much service, stepped forward, and, disrobing\r\nhimself of this outer garment, stood full before the President. He was a\r\nthin, faded little fellow, whose clothes seemed to be somewhat too large\r\nfor him. His eye was gray and rather dull, his physiognomy melancholy,\r\nhis cheek sunken, his complexion freckled, his coat blue, the buttons\r\ndingy, his hair sandy, and like untwisted rope. The first glance at the\r\nperson of this new-comer gave every man of the club the assurance that\r\nhere was an editor indeed. A whisper of approbation ran through the\r\ncrowd, and from that moment, as Mr. Doubleday afterward said to me, we\r\nfelt assured that we had the man we wanted.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President,\" said he, in a feeble and sickly voice, \"my name _is_\r\nFox. I am in want of employment. Sir,\" he added, gritting his teeth and\r\ntaking an attitude, \"if the rancor of my soul, accumulated by\r\nmaltreatment, set on edge by disappointment, indurated by time, entitle\r\nme to claim your confidence, then, sir, my claim stands number one. If a\r\nthorough knowledge, sir, of the characteristic traits of Federalism,\r\nlong acquaintance with its designs, persecution, sir, from its votaries,\r\na deep experience of its black ingratitude; if days of toil spent in its\r\nservice, nights of feverish anxiety protracted in ruminating over its\r\npurposes; if promises violated, hopes blasted, labors unrewarded, may be\r\ndeemed a stimulus to hatred--then, sir, am I richly endowed with the\r\nqualifications to expose the enemies of Quodlibetarian Democracy. I am a\r\nchild, sir, of sorrow: the milk of my nature has been curdled by\r\nneglect. Mine is a history of talents underrated, sensibilities derided,\r\npatriotism spurned, affluence, nay competence, withheld. The world has\r\nturned me aside. I have no resting place on the bosom of my mother.\r\nSociety, like a demon, pursues me. Writs in the hands of the sheriff,\r\njudgments on the docket, _fi. fas._ and _ca. sas._ track my footsteps.\r\nNo limitation runs in my favor: the _scire facias_, ever ready, revives\r\nthe inhuman judgment, and my second shirt--my first is in rags--is\r\nstripped from my body to glut the avarice of my relentless pursuers.\r\nThank God, I have at last found a friend in that distinguished man who\r\nhas been so ruthlessly, so recently assailed, by that fledgling of the\r\naristocracy, Augustus Postlethwaite Tompkinson. Yes, sir, in the Hon.\r\nMiddleton Flam I have found a friend. He has given me letters to this\r\nbenevolent gentleman, Mr. Handy; he has recommended my establishment\r\nhere; he promises to co-operate with this respectable club in giving me\r\na foothold among you. With her Flams and her Handys, Quodlibet is\r\ndestined to an enviable influence in this great Republic.\" (Here he was\r\ninterrupted by loud cheers.) \"My scheme is, Mr. President, with the aid\r\nof this club, and that of the benefactors I have named, forthwith\r\nto start THE QUODLIBET WHOLE HOG. It shall take a decided and\r\nuncompromising stand against THE THOROUGH BLUE WHOLE TEAM, (here he was\r\nagain arrested by cheers;) pledged to contradict every word uttered by\r\nthat vile print, (cheers;) to traduce and bring down its editor by the\r\nmost systematic disparagement, (cheers;) to disprove all Whig\r\nassertions; unfailingly to take the opposite side on all questions;\r\nindustriously to lower the standing of the members of the Whig party,\r\n(immense cheers;) through thick and thin, good report and evil report,\r\nfor better and for worse, to defend and sustain the administration of\r\nthe new President, who is about to take his seat, that incomparable\r\nDemocrat of the genuine Quodlibetarian stamp, Martin Van Buren, (at this\r\npoint the cheering continued for some moments, with such violence that\r\nthe speaker had to suspend his remarks;) and finally, sir, to commend,\r\nexalt, and illustrate the character and pretensions of our unrivaled\r\nfriend Mr. Flam, (immense cheering,) giving utterance to his sentiments,\r\npreponderance to his opinions, authority to his advice on all proper and\r\nsuitable occasions, (loud cheering for a long time.) In short, sir, The\r\nWhole Hog shall be what its name imports, a faithful mirror of the\r\nDemocracy of Quodlibet. Its publication shall be weekly; its size,\r\ntwenty-six by twenty, having the advantage over the Whole Team by full\r\ntwo inches each way. There, sir, is an outline of my sentiments and\r\nproposed paper.\" Mr. Fox concluded this address in the midst of a\r\ncongratulatory uproar, altogether unprecedented in the club.\r\n\r\nSeizing upon the enthusiasm of the moment, and being rather fearful\r\nthat Fog would attempt to make a speech, which that gentleman's\r\ncondition would have rendered extremely improper at this hour, Mr. Handy\r\nimmediately offered a resolution for the establishment of the Whole Hog,\r\nand its adoption as the organ of the party, on the principles proposed\r\nby Mr. Fox. This was carried by acclamation; and the members without\r\nfurther discussion adjourned to the bar-room, where Nim Porter offered a\r\nbet--and not finding any one to take him up, continued to offer it\r\nduring the evening--of fifty dollars to twenty-five, or one hundred to\r\nfifty, that Eliphalet Fox would run Augustus Postlethwaite Tompkinson's\r\nWhole Team out of Quodlibet in six months from that day:--that there\r\nwould not be but two copies of the Whole Team taken in the Borough, and\r\nthat one of them would be Michael Grant's out at the Hogback:--\"for,\"\r\nsaid Nim, with an oath, which I will not repeat--\"I can see it in that\r\nLiphlet Fox's eye; if he isn't a gouger when his bile's fresh, there\r\naint nothing in Lavender on Physiology, or Fowler on the Shape of\r\nHeads.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  BEING A SHORT HISTORY OF ELIPHALET FOX.\r\n\r\n\r\nEliphalet Fox's paper, \"The Whole Hog,\" made its first appearance on the\r\nday of the inauguration of President Van Buren. Bright were the omens\r\nthat heralded its birth. The lustrous orb of Jackson had just set in an\r\nocean of splendor. Happy old man! Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere\r\ncausas! In the glowing language of his own immortal valedictory, he left\r\n\"this great people prosperous and happy.\" That star of the second\r\nmagnitude, Martin Van Buren, first among the sidera minora, had just\r\nrisen. In the nearly equally immortal salutatory of this Sidus Minor, he\r\nspake the words, \"we present an aggregate of human prosperity surely not\r\nelsewhere to be found.\" Fortunate omens, incomparable auspices! Under\r\nthese cheering signs \"The Whole Hog\" appeared upon the stage.\r\n\r\nNever was paper more faithful to the Quodlibetarian theory. Never was\r\neditor more richly endowed to sustain that theory than Eliphalet Fox. My\r\nreader will doubtless expect that I should impart such gleanings of the\r\neditor's life as my diligent researches have enabled me to collect. This\r\nreasonable expectation shall be indulged.\r\n\r\nEliphalet Fox was one of those men whose career furnishes so remarkable\r\na commentary upon the beneficent character of our great Democratic\r\nQuodlibetarian principle. His ancestors, two generations back, were\r\nFederal and rich: in the last generation they were Federal and poor--a\r\ntransition strikingly natural and eminently illustrative of our free\r\ninstitutions. Eliphalet was born in the town of Gabwrangle, in the\r\nadjoining State. His education was circumscribed to the circle of\r\nreading, writing, and arithmetic, which Eliphalet himself sometimes\r\njocosely describes as algebraically denoted by the signs of the three\r\nRs; to wit, Reading, Righting, and Rithmetic--a joke (mehercule) both\r\ningenious and new!\r\n\r\nHis parents being, as I may say, inops pecuniae, bound Eliphalet to a\r\ntrade; but handicraft was abhorrent to his genius. His temper was sour\r\nand peevish; and though seemingly meek, even to a degree of asininity,\r\nin his demeanor, yet it was early discovered that, upon occasion, he\r\ncould very deftly and nimbly, as the poet says, \"unpack his heart with\r\nwords and fall to swearing like a very drab.\" This art was too valuable\r\nin Eliphalet's time to go long without a patron; and, accordingly, after\r\nhe had worked four most reluctant years in a printing-office, to which\r\nhis respectable parents, thwarting the current of his genius, had\r\ndevoted him, he was discovered and taken by the hand by Mr. Theophilus\r\nFlam, brother of the late Judge, and leader of the Federal party of\r\nGabwrangle. It was just before the war; and the party being hard set\r\nupon by its enemies, had, like a cat surrounded by curs, thrown itself\r\nupon its back, and essayed to defend itself, most cattishly, with claw\r\nand tooth. And sharply, as we well know, did they fight. Eliphalet, in\r\nthis strife, played the part of a claw, showing most admirable spring\r\nnails, though ordinarily hid, and therefore but little suspected in his\r\nvelvet paw. His position in this battle was that of conductor of \"The\r\nGabwrangle Grimalkin,\" a cross-grained, querulous, tart and vinegarish\r\nlittle folio, which hoisted the banner of Theophilus Flam, and swore in\r\nhis words. Eliphalet Fox, in consequence of the trusty position which\r\nwas thus confided to him, and still more by reason of a certain rabid\r\nbut laudable hatred of all who bore the name of Democrat, in those days,\r\n(and here I would have my reader mark that a Democrat of 1812 was a very\r\ndifferent thing from a Democrat of this our day, especially from a true\r\nQuodlibetarian Democrat,) rose to be a person of great consideration in\r\nGabwrangle. The party of Theophilus Flam, like our illustrious chief of\r\nthe new Democracy, Mr. Van Buren, made sturdy opposition to Madison and\r\nhis unrighteous war, and finally enjoyed the satisfaction of a complete\r\ntriumph over all their political adversaries in Gabwrangle, by an utter\r\nroute of the spurious Democrats who opposed them: a point of good\r\nfortune which did not fall to the lot of our illustrious chief at\r\nKinderhook; since history records the disastrous fact that he, so far\r\nfrom conquering, was obliged to give in, and was even unhappily\r\ncompelled, by the force of adverse winds, to go over to the majority,\r\n(an event very distressing to his feelings,) when he found that that\r\nmajority was so obstinate as to refuse to come on his side: he was, if I\r\nmay so say, as it were, a prisoner-of-war, and acted under a vis major.\r\nBut at Gabwrangle--thanks to the persevering tongue and pen of Eliphalet\r\nFox!--it was all the other way; and \"The Grimalkin,\" to the last,\r\nenjoyed a most enviable renown as the bitterest reviler of Mr. Madison\r\nand his doings.\r\n\r\nHabit grows into an instinct, and as times change our habits are the\r\nlast to follow the fashion. It is only by referring to this deep-seated\r\nprinciple of human nature, that I am able to account for the\r\nextraordinary vituperation which Eliphalet Fox, at a later day, poured\r\nupon the head of the Old Hero when he was brought out for President. The\r\nGrimalkin, like all poison-concocting animals, grew more venomous as it\r\ngrew older; and were it not that Eliphalet has repented of this folly,\r\nand amply atoned for its commission, I should blush to record the almost\r\nsavage ferocity, the altogether unpardonable acerbity, and, above all,\r\nthe thoroughly unquodlibetarian freedom with which he assailed the\r\npurest man that in the tide of time--as another pure man has\r\nremarked--ever appeared upon this terraqueous globe. But the truth is,\r\nEliphalet had fallen into _a habit_ of detraction, and did it without\r\nthinking:--that is the best excuse that can be made for him. The old\r\nFederalists of Gabwrangle, and, foremost among them, his master,\r\nTheophilus Flam, soon corrected this unhappy proclivity, and gave him to\r\nunderstand that he was on a wrong scent. They peremptorily, to their\r\ngreat honor, insisted that from that day forth the Grimalkin must be\r\ndecent. The consequence of this was fatal to Eliphalet Fox--fatal at\r\nleast to his prosperity in Gabwrangle. Thenceforth the Grimalkin sunk\r\ninto insignificance. As the poet says, Othello's occupation was gone.\r\nThe subscribers grew testy and dropped off, under the influence of this\r\nuncongenial decency exacted from the editor. Eliphalet borrowed money,\r\nhis habiliments grew shabby, he took up mean callings for the sake of\r\npelf, he became a spunge; he grew bilious, atrabilious, patriotic and\r\nindignant. He went for REFORM--reform of the General Government, reform\r\nof the State Constitution, reform of private manners, reform of public\r\nobservances. He took up an aversion to all kinds of respectability,\r\nbecame a deadly enemy to every man who laid up any money--made this\r\nsentiment a political question, talked of a division of property, called\r\nNature a stepmother, said sundry hard things about the persecution of\r\ngenius, and finally, one Sunday night, eloped from Gabwrangle, leaving\r\nhis fiscal responsibilities in a state of as much perplexity as that\r\ninto which these vile Whigs have brought those of the government. Alas,\r\nfor Eliphalet! little did he dream that out of this desolation and\r\ndismay he was to pluck so bright a flower of prosperity as he now wears\r\nin his bosom. All the hounds of the law--as he so eloquently painted it\r\nto the New Light at our celebrated meeting--were set upon his track; but\r\ngrace to his better destiny! he eluded them. To twenty writs placed on\r\nMonday morning in the sheriff's hands, that functionary made his\r\nreturn on Tuesday evening, \"Eloped under whip and spur out of the\r\nbailiwick.\"--Oh, lucky Eliphalet!\r\n\r\nIn these straits the badgered patriot went to Washington; was\r\nrecognized by our distinguished representative, who, knowing that we\r\nwere in want of an editor fit to cope with The Whole Team, gave him a\r\nwarm letter of recommendation to Nicodemus Handy, and forthwith was\r\nprojected that famous movement, whereof I have already given the\r\nhistory, and which has so auspiciously resulted in the establishment of\r\nThe Quodlibet Whole Hog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  ASTOUNDING EVENT--SUSPENSION OF SPECIE PAYMENTS--PROCEEDINGS\r\n     OF THE BANK OF QUODLIBET THEREUPON--RESOLVE OF THE DIRECTORS\r\n     AGAINST SUSPENSION--CONSPIRACY AND THREATENED REVOLUTION\r\n     HEADED BY FLAN. SUCKER--DIRECTORS CHANGE THEIR MIND--THEIR\r\n     CONSTERNATION AND ESCAPE--REMARKABLE BRAVERY AND PRESENCE\r\n     OF MIND OF THE HON. MIDDLETON FLAM--HIS SPLENDID APPEAL TO\r\n     THE INSURGENTS--GENERAL JACKSON'S ORACULAR VIEWS IN REGARD\r\n     TO THE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nProh hominum fidem!\r\n\r\nIt falls to my lot, at this stage of my history, to be constrained to\r\nrecord an event the most astounding, the most awful, the most\r\nunexpected, the most treacherous, the most ungrateful, the most\r\nflagitious--yea, the most supereminently flagitious,--that the history\r\nof mankind affords. Notwithstanding that laudatory and political\r\nejaculation which the Hero and Sage breathed out in the evening of his\r\nbrilliant career, like the last notes of the swan, \"I leave this great\r\npeople prosperous and happy\"--notwithstanding that flattering canzonet,\r\nwith which he who pledges himself to walk in the Hero and Sage's\r\nfootsteps, began his illustrious course, singing as it were the morning\r\ncarol of the lark--\"we present an aggregate of human prosperity surely\r\nnot elsewhere to be found\"--the echo of these sweet sounds had not died\r\naway upon the tympana of our ravished ears, before these banks--these\r\ngentle pet banks--these fostered, favored, sugar-plum and candy-fed pet\r\nbanks, with all their troop of plethoric and pampered paragon sister\r\nbanks, one and all, without one pang of remorse, without one word of\r\nwarning, without even, as far as we could see, one tingle of a\r\nsuppressed and struggling blush, incontinently suspended specie\r\npayments!! O curas hominum! Quantum est in rebus inane!\r\n\r\nShall I tell it? Even the Patriotic Copperplate Bank of Quodlibet was\r\ncompelled to follow in this faithless path. Not at once, I confess--not\r\noff-hand, and with such malice prepense as the others--for Nicodemus\r\nHandy had a soul above such black ingratitude--but after a pause, and,\r\nlet the truth be told in extenuation, because he could not help it.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Middleton Flam was sent for upon the first tidings of\r\nthis extraordinary kicking in the traces by these high-mettled\r\ninstitutions--tidings which reached Quodlibet, via the canal, about\r\neleven o'clock one morning in May. The Directors were summoned into\r\ncouncil. What was to be done? was the general question. Anthony\r\nHardbottle, of the firm of Barndollar & Hardbottle--a grave man and a\r\nthoughtful; a man without flash, who seldom smiles--a lean man, hard\r\nfavored and simple in his outgoings and incomings; a man, who has never\r\nsported, as long as I have known him, any other coat than that\r\nsnuff-brown with covered buttons, and who does not wear out above one\r\npair of shoes in a year; a man who could never be persuaded to give so\r\nfar into the times as to put on a black cravat, but has always stuck to\r\nthe white:--such a man, it may be easily imagined, was not to be carried\r\naway by new-fangled notions:--he was there at the Board, in place of\r\nTheodore Fog, who was compelled two years before to withdraw his name as\r\na candidate for re-election. This same Anthony Hardbottle, speaking\r\nunder the dictates of that cautious wisdom natural to him as a merchant,\r\nanswered this question of What was to be done?--by another equally\r\nlaconic and pregnant with meaning----\r\n\r\n\"How much cash have we on hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"One hundred and seven dollars and thirty-seven and a half cents in\r\nsilver,\" replied Nicodemus, \"and five half eagles in gold, which were\r\nbrought here by our honorable President and placed on deposit, after he\r\nhad used them in the last election for the purpose of showing the people\r\nwhat an admirable currency we were to have, as soon as Mr. Benton should\r\nsucceed in making it float up the stream of the Mississippi.\"\r\n\r\nAgain asked Anthony Hardbottle, \"What circulation have you abroad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Six hundred thousand dollars,\" replied Nicodemus, \"and a trifle over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Anthony, \"I think we had better suspend with the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" said the Hon. Middleton Flam, rising from his seat and thumping\r\nthe table violently with his hand. \"Never, sir, while I am President of\r\nthis bank, and there is a shot in the locker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo--well said, admirably said, spoke as a Quodlibetarian ought to\r\nspeak!\" shouted Dr. Thomas G. Winkleman, the keeper of the soda-water\r\nPavilion; \"I have fifteen dollars in five-penny bits; they are at the\r\nservice of the Board, and while I hold a piece of coin, the Patriotic\r\nCopperplate Bank shall never be subjected to the reproach of being\r\nunable to meet its obligations. Anthony Hardbottle, as a Democrat I am\r\nsurprised at you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help it,\" replied Anthony; \"in my opinion, our issues are\r\nlarger than our means.\"\r\n\r\n\"How larger, sir?\" demanded Mr. Snuffers, the President of the New\r\nLight, with some asperity of tone.--\"Haven't we a batch of bran-new\r\nnotes, just signed and ready for delivery? Redeem the old ones with new.\r\nWhy should we suspend?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, I will put the question to the Board,\" interposed Mr. Flam,\r\nfearful lest a quarrel might arise, if the debate continued. \"Shall this\r\nbank suspend specie payments? Those in favor of this iniquitous\r\nproposition will say AY.\"\r\n\r\nNo one answered. Anthony Hardbottle was intimidated by the President's\r\nstern manner.\r\n\r\n\"Those opposed to it will say NO.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" was the universal acclamation of the Board, with the exception of\r\nAnthony Hardbottle who did not open his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Flam, \"for this generous support. I\r\nshould have been compelled by the adoption of this proposition, much as\r\nI esteem this Board, much as I value your good opinion, to have returned\r\nthe commission with which you have honored me as your President. Our\r\ncountry first, and then ourselves! The Democracy of Quodlibet never will\r\nsuspend!\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment confused noises were heard in the banking-room, which\r\nadjoined that in which the Directors were convened. Mr. Handy\r\nimmediately sprang from his chair and went into this apartment.\r\n\r\nThere stood about thirty persons, principally boatmen from the canal. At\r\ntheir head, some paces advanced into the bank, was Flanigan Sucker. One\r\nsleeve of Flan's coat was torn open from the shoulder to the wrist; his\r\nshirt, of a very indefinite complexion, was open at the breast,\r\ndisclosing the shaggy mat of hair that adorned this part of his person;\r\nhis corduroy trowsers had but one suspender to keep them up, thus giving\r\nthem rather a lop-sided set. His face was fiery-red; and his hat, which\r\nwas considerably frayed at the brim, was drawn over one ear, and left\r\nuncovered a large portion of his forehead and crown which were\r\nembellished by wild elf locks of carroty hue.\r\n\r\n\"Nicodemus,\" said Flan. as soon as the Cashier made his appearance, \"we\r\nhave come to make a run upon the bank:--they say you've bursted your\r\nbiler.\" Then turning to the crowd behind him, he shouted, \"Growl,\r\nTigers!--Yip! yip! Hurra!\"\r\n\r\nAs Flan. yelled out these words, a strange muttering sound broke forth\r\nfrom the multitude.\r\n\r\n\"What put into your drunken noddle that we have broke?\" inquired Mr.\r\nHandy, with great composure, as soon as silence was restored.\r\n\r\n\"Nim Porter ses, Nicodemus, that you're a gone horse, and that if you\r\nain't busted up, you will be before night. So we have determined on a\r\nrun.\"\r\n\r\nNim Porter, who was standing in the rear of the crowd, where he had\r\ncome to see how matters were going on, now stepped forward. Nim is the\r\nfattest man in Quodlibet, and besides, is the most dressy and\r\ngood-natured man we have. On this occasion there he stood with a stiff\r\nstarched linen roundabout jacket on, as white as the driven snow, with\r\nwhite drilling pantaloons just from the washerwoman, and the most\r\nstrutting ruffle to his shirt that could have been manufactured out of\r\ncambric. In all points he was unlike the crowd of persons who occupied\r\nthe room. \"I said nothing of the sort--\" was Nim's reply--\"and I am\r\nwilling now to bet ten to one that he can't produce a man here to say I\r\nsaid so.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the odds!\" cried Flan; \"Nicodemus, we are resolved upon a\r\nrun--so shell out!\"\r\n\r\n\"Begin when it suits you,\" said Mr. Handy. \"Let me have your note, and I\r\nwill give you either silver or gold as you choose.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't catch me that way,\" shouted Flan., with a drunken grimace.\r\n\"Notes is not in my line--shell out anyhow. We have determined on a\r\nrun--a genuine, dimmycratic sortie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you none of our paper?\" again inquired Mr. Handy.\r\n\r\n\"Not a shaving, Nicodemus,\" replied Flan. \"What's the odds?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have,\" said a big, squinting boatman, as he walked up to our\r\nCashier, and untied his leather wallet. \"There's sixty dollars, and I'll\r\nthank you for the cash.\r\n\r\n\"And I have twenty-five more,\" cried out another.\r\n\r\n\"And I twice twenty-five,\" said a gruff voice from the midst of the\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nAll this time the number of persons outside was increasing, and very\r\nprofane swearing was heard about the door. Mr. Handy stepped to the\r\nwindow to get a view of the assemblage, and seeing that nearly all the\r\nmovable part of Quodlibet was gathering in front of the building, he\r\nretired with some trepidation into the Directors' room, and informed Mr.\r\nFlam and the Board of what was going on. They had a pretty good\r\nsuspicion of this before Mr. Handy returned, for they had distinctly\r\nheard the uproar. Mr. Handy no sooner communicated the fact to them,\r\nthan Mr. Flam, with considerable perturbation in his looks, rose and\r\ndeclared that Quodlibet was in a state of insurrection; and, as every\r\none must be aware, that in the midst of a revolution no bank could be\r\nexpected to pay specie, he moved, in consideration of this menacing\r\nstate of affairs, that the Patriotic Copperplate Bank of Quodlibet\r\nsuspend specie payments forthwith, and continue the same until such time\r\nas the re-establishment of the public peace should authorize a\r\nresumption. This motion was gratefully received by the Board, and\r\ncarried without a division. During this interval, the conspirators\r\nhaving learned, through their leader, Flan. Sucker, that the Hon.\r\nMiddleton Flam was in the house, forthwith set up a violent shouting for\r\nthat distinguished gentleman to appear at the door. It was some moments\r\nbefore our representative was willing to obey this summons: the Board of\r\nDirectors were thrown into a panic, and with great expedition got out of\r\nthe back window into the yard, and made their escape--thus leaving the\r\nindomitable and unflinching President of the bank, a man of lion heart,\r\nalone in the apartment; while the yells and shouts of the multitude were\r\nringing in his ears with awful reduplication. He was not at a loss to\r\nperform his duty, but, with a dignified and stately movement, stalked\r\ninto the banking-room, approached the window that looked upon the\r\nstreet, threw it open, and gave himself in full view to the multitude.\r\n\r\nThere was a dreadful pause; a scowl sat upon every brow; a muttering\r\nsilence prevailed. As Tacitus says: \"Non tumultus, non quies, sed quale\r\nmagni metus, et magnae irae silentium est.\" Mr. Flam raised his arm, and\r\nspoke in this strain:--\r\n\r\n\"Men of Quodlibet, what madness has seized upon you? Do you assemble in\r\nfront of this edifice to make the day hideous with howling? Is it to\r\ninsult Nicodemus Handy, a worthy New Light, or is it to affright the\r\nuniverse by pulling down these walls? Shame on you, men of Quodlibet! If\r\nyou have a vengeance to wreak, do not inflict it upon us. Go to the\r\nWhigs, the authors of our misfortune. They have brought these things\r\nupon us. Year after year have we been struggling to give you a\r\nconstitutional currency--the real Jackson gold----\"\r\n\r\n\"Three cheers for Middleton Flam!\" cried out twenty voices, and\r\nstraightway the cheers ascended on the air; and in the midst was heard a\r\nwell-known voice, \"Yip! yip!--Go it, Middleton!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my friends,\" proceeded the orator, \"while we have been laboring\r\nto give you the solid metals; while we have been fighting against this\r\nPAPER-MONEY PARTY, and have devoted all our energies to the endeavor to\r\nprostrate the influence of these RAG BARONS, these MONOPOLISTS, THESE\r\nCHAMPIONS OF VESTED RIGHTS AND CHARTERED PRIVILEGES, the WHIGS--we have\r\nbeen foiled at every turn by the power of their unholy combinations of\r\nassociated wealth. They have filled your land with banks, and have\r\nbrought upon us all the curses of _over-trading_ and _over-speculating_,\r\nuntil the people are literally on their faces at the footstool of the\r\nMoney Power. (Tremendous cheering.) Our course has been resolute and\r\nunwaveringly patriotic. We have stood in the breach and met the storm;\r\nbut all without avail. Between the rich and the poor lies a mighty gulf.\r\nThe rich man _has_, the poor man _wants_. Of that which the rich hath,\r\ndoes he give to the poor? Answer me, men of Quodlibet.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" arose, deep-toned, from every throat.\r\n\r\n\"Then our course is plain. Poor men, one and all, rally round our\r\nDemocratic banner. Let the aristocrats know and feel that you will not\r\nbear this tyranny.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will,\" shouted Flan. Sucker. \"Go it, Middleton!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" continued Mr. Flam, \"this bank of ours is purely\r\nDEMOCRATIC. It is an exception to all other banks; it is emphatically\r\nthe poor man's friend: nothing can exceed the skill and caution with\r\nwhich it has been conducted. Would that all other banks were like it! We\r\nhave, comparatively, but a small issue of paper afloat; we have a large\r\nsupply of specie. You perceive, therefore, that we fear no run. You all\r\nsaw with what alacrity our Cashier proffered to redeem whatever amount\r\nour respectable fellow-citizen, that excellent Democrat, Mr. Flanigan\r\nSucker, might demand. (Cheers, and a cry of 'Yip!') Mr. Sucker was\r\nsatisfied, and did not desire to burden himself with specie. Gentlemen,\r\ndepend upon _me_. When there is danger, if such a thing could be to this\r\nNew-Light Democratic bank, I will be the first to give you warning.\r\n(Cheers, and 'Hurrah for Flam.') Born with an instinctive love of the\r\npeople, I should be the vilest of men, if I could ever forget my duty to\r\nthem. (Immense cheering, and cries of 'Flam forever!') Take my advice,\r\nretire to your homes, keep an eye on the Whigs and their wicked schemes\r\nto bolster up the State banks, make no run upon this institution--it is\r\nan ill bird that defiles its own nest--and, before you depart,\r\ngentlemen, let me inform you that, having the greatest regard to your\r\ninterest, we have determined upon a temporary suspension, as a mere\r\nmatter of caution against the intrigues of the Whigs, who, we have every\r\nreason to believe, actuated by their implacable hatred of the New-Light\r\nDemocracy, will assail this, your favorite bank, with a malevolence\r\nunexampled in all their past career. (Loud cheers, and cries of 'Stand\r\nby the bank.') But, Quodlibetarians, rally, and present a phalanx more\r\nterrible than the Macedonian to the invader. You can--I am sure you\r\nwill--and, therefore, I tell you your bank is safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can, we will!\" rose from the whole multitude, accompanied with\r\ncheers that might vie with the bursting of the ocean surge.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" added Mr. Flam, \"I thank you for the manifestation of this\r\npatriotic sentiment. It is no more than I expected of Quodlibet. In\r\nconclusion, I am requested, my good friends, by Mr. Handy, to say that\r\nhaving just prepared some notes on a _superior_ paper, he will redeem at\r\nthe counter any old ones you may chance to hold, in that new emission;\r\nand I can with pride assure you, that this late supply is equal,\r\nperhaps, to anything that has ever been issued in the United States.\r\nWith my best wishes, gentlemen, for your permanent prosperity, under the\r\nnew and glorious dynasty of that distinguished New-Light Democrat, whom\r\nthe unbought suffrages of millions of freemen have called to the supreme\r\nexecutive chair, (cheers,) and under whose lead we fondly indulge the\r\nhope of speedily sweeping from existence this pestilential brood of Whig\r\nbanks, I respectfully take my leave.\"\r\n\r\nHaving concluded this masterly appeal to the reason and good sense of\r\nthe people, Mr. Flam withdrew under nine distinct rounds of applause.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this powerful speech, which has often since been compared\r\nto that of Cicero against Catiline, was completely to still the public\r\nmind of Quodlibet, and also to remove all apprehensions of the solidity\r\nof our bank. But its happiest feature was the vindication of the bank\r\nagainst that charge of treachery and ingratitude which so justly lies at\r\nthe door of all the other banks of the country. The Patriotic\r\nCopperplate Bank of Quodlibet was, as Mr. Flam observed, _purely\r\nDemocratic_--Democratic in its origin, in its principles, in its\r\norganization, in its management, in its officers, its stockholders, and\r\nits customers. Such a bank, of course, could not be unfaithful to the\r\nDemocratic administration that fostered it--_infidelity or ingratitude\r\nto party is no inhabitant of a Democratic bosom_. If there be men upon\r\nearth who go all lengths, through thick and thin, for party, it is (I\r\nsay it with pride) the genuine New-Light Quodlibetarian Democracy. Our\r\nbank, therefore, stands uncontaminated by that revolting perfidy which,\r\nat the instigation of Biddle and the Barings, brought all the other\r\nbanks, in which there are Whig directors or officers, into the most\r\nwicked conspiracy recorded in history.\r\n\r\nIt was not long after this astounding event before the opinions uttered\r\nabove were fully and most remarkably confirmed by a letter from the\r\nHermitage; a letter which for its shrewdness of view, its perspicacity,\r\nits lucid style and Hero-and-Sage-like felicity of construction, is\r\nunequaled in the productions of the venerable Chief. I am happy to\r\ninsert it here, as a most eloquent exposition of the causes of the\r\nsuspension--feeling assured that its distinguished author had no\r\nreference to the Democratic banks, and especially none to ours of\r\nQuodlibet, but intended it entirely for the vile Whigs.\r\n\r\n\"_The history of the world_,\" says this immortal man, writing July\r\nninth, to the virgin-minded, tremulously-sensitive, and unrewarded\r\neditor of the Globe, \"_never has recorded such base treachery and\r\nperfidy as has been committed by the deposit banks against the\r\ngovernment, and purely with a view of gratifying Biddle and the Barings,\r\nand by the suspension of specie payments, degrade, embarrass, and ruin,\r\nif they could, their own country, for the selfish views of making large\r\nprofits by throwing out millions of depreciated paper upon the\r\npeople--selling their specie at large premiums, and buying up their own\r\npaper at discounts of from 25 to 50 per cent., and now looking forward\r\nto be indulged in these speculations for years to come before they\r\nresume specie payments._\"\r\n\r\nOracular old man! Sage and Seer! Priest and Prophet to lead thine\r\nIsraelites beyond Jordan! Happy do I, S. S., Schoolmaster of Quodlibet,\r\naccount myself that I have lived in this thy day!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  SIGNS OF DISCORD IN QUODLIBET--THE IRON-RAILING\r\n     CONTROVERSY--AGAMEMNON FLAG'S NOMINATION--REVOLT OF THEODORE\r\n     FOG--THE CELEBRATED SPLIT--CONSEQUENCES OF JESSE FERRET'S\r\n     PERNICIOUS DOGMA IN REFERENCE TO PUBLICANS--FIRST FRUITS OF THE\r\n     SPLIT MANIFESTED AT MRS. FERRET'S TEA DRINKING--GRAVE REFLECTIONS\r\n     BY THE AUTHOR--MORAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exciting summer of 1837, with the special election of a member of\r\nCongress for the extra session--to which we returned our long-tried\r\nand faithful representative, Mr. Middleton Flam, almost without\r\nopposition--went by. All eyes were turned upon the proceedings of\r\nCongress at that extra sitting; and a great many speculations were\r\nafloat in Quodlibet, where, I am pained to disclose the fact, very\r\nserious contrariety of opinion began to spring up in reference to the\r\nSub-Treasury. Our State election, for members of the Legislature, was to\r\ncome on in October, and a convention, called for the purpose,\r\nhad nominated Agamemnon Flag, at the head of the ticket, with\r\nAbram Schoolcraft, the nursery man in Bickerbray, and Curtius\r\nShort, Cheap store-keeper in Tumbledown, as the Regular New-Light\r\nDemocratic Quodlibetarian candidates. Unhappily this nomination gave\r\ndissatisfaction to numbers of our friends. Agamemnon Flag, who was the\r\nonly stump man on the ticket, (Schoolcraft and Short having expressly\r\nstipulated that they were not to be called on to speak in the canvass,)\r\nwas a young member of the bar, comparatively a stranger to many in the\r\nBorough, (having within the last year removed from Bickerbray,) and,\r\nlaboring under the infirmity of short-sightedness, wore a delicate pair\r\nof gold spectacles. I have observed that short-sighted persons in\r\ngeneral are not apt to be popular in a Democratic government.\r\n\r\nBut there was another matter that operated against Agamemnon. Quodlibet\r\nhad been made the county-seat of justice by an act of the last\r\nLegislature, and we were just finishing a court-house which, in\r\nanticipation of this event, we had commenced a year before. A question\r\narose among the townspeople, whether the court-house square should be\r\nsurrounded by a wooden or by an iron railing. This question created\r\ngreat agitation. Several Whigs of the Borough made themselves active in\r\nthe debate, and went for the iron. The New-Light Quods were strong for\r\nwood. Agamemnon Flag, seeing that a great deal of ill blood was getting\r\nup between the parties, made a speech to a town meeting on this subject,\r\nand went in for a compromise--he was for wood on the _two sides_ and\r\n_back_ of the square, and iron _in front_. This proposition he advocated\r\nwith great earnestness and ability, and finally carried his point by a\r\nclose vote. The wooden party said that the vote was not a fair one, and\r\nthat they could not regard it as a legitimate expression of the popular\r\nvoice, because it was taken just as a shower of rain was coming up, when\r\nmany persons present who had come without umbrellas had given no heed to\r\nthe question, and voted as it were in the dark. However, the vote was\r\nnot recalled, and the iron railing is now in a course of fabrication\r\nover at the Hogback Forge, which happens unluckily to be owned by\r\nStephen P. Crabstock, one of the most bull-headed Whigs in this county,\r\nthe job being given by the commissioners to him in consequence of there\r\nbeing no genuine New-Light Democratic iron works in this part of the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nWhen Agamemnon Flag was brought out at the head of the ticket for the\r\nLegislature, nothing was said about the iron railing, and we had good\r\nreason to suppose that every true Quod would support the nomination;\r\nwhich in fact was made by the direction of our honorable representative\r\nin Congress, who had a great liking for Flag in consequence of a very\r\nbeautifully written memoir of Mr. Flam, which appeared two years ago in\r\nthe Bickerbray Scrutinizer, when Flag lived in that town. In point of\r\nprinciple, Agamemnon was altogether unexceptionable. He was an\r\nout-and-out Flamite of the first water, and an unadulterated\r\nQuodlibetarian in every sentiment.\r\n\r\nTheodore Fog--I regret to be obliged to mention his name in any terms\r\nof disparagement, because he is unquestionably a man of talents and a\r\ntrue-bred New Light, and certainly we owe Theodore a good deal--had been\r\nvery sour for some time past. He had never forgotten the making of\r\nMiddleton Flam President of the bank. I have in a former chapter hinted\r\nsomewhat of Theodore's unfortunate habits. Dolet mihi,--I grieve to\r\nrepeat these things. But the truth must be told. His diurnal aberrations\r\nbecame at length so conspicuous that, after being twice elected a\r\nDirector of the bank, his name was struck off the ticket and Anthony\r\nHardbottle's substituted in his place. Theodore never had much practice\r\nat the bar, although he considers himself the founder of that fraternity\r\nat Quodlibet, being for a season the only lawyer in the Borough. That\r\nlittle practice had now pretty nearly left him; in consequence of which\r\nhe thought himself badly used, and therefore entitled to a support from\r\nthe public. These feelings operating upon his mind, induced him, soon\r\nafter the nomination of Agamemnon Flag, to come out in opposition and\r\ndeclare himself an Independent Candidate.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs, taking advantage of this split in the party, brought out Andy\r\nGrant, son of old Michael of the Hogback; a young man of fair character,\r\nbut wholly and fatally imbued with those dangerous opinions which have\r\nalready brought so many misfortunes upon our country.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of things at the commencement of the month of\r\nSeptember; and it will be seen in the sequel that very serious\r\ndifficulties grew out of this division.\r\n\r\nA meeting of the voters of the county, which included the three towns of\r\nQuodlibet, Tumbledown, and Bickerbray, was called at the Sycamore\r\nSpring, upon the Rumblebottom, about five miles below Quodlibet. This\r\nmeeting was to be held on the eighth. A reference to these events is\r\nnecessary to explain the scene which I am about to present to my reader.\r\n\r\nJesse Ferret, as my reader knows, had brought himself into some scandal\r\nby his indefinite political sentiments, and that most unquodlibetarian\r\ndogma that \"a Publican should have no side.\" Now, Mrs. Ferret and her\r\ndaughter, Susan Barndollar, were just antipodes to Jesse. Two truer\r\nwomen, more firm-set in the New-Light Democracy, more constant in\r\nopinion, whether in the utterance thereof or in its quality, and better\r\nable to hold their own, have I never chanced to meet, than this\r\nrespectable mother and daughter. It is common to say women are not\r\nallowed a voice in our government. My faith! these two ladies had a\r\nvoice in Quodlibet, allowed or not allowed--let the theory go as it\r\nmay:--and Jesse Ferret knows that full well.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ferret is what we call a fleshy or lusty woman: she weighed two\r\nhundred and twelve, in Neal Hopper's new one-sided patent scale at the\r\nmill. She is amazingly well padded with fat across the shoulders, and\r\nhas a craw-shaped bosom that in some degree encroaches upon her neck;\r\nand she is famous for wearing a large frilled and quilled cap with many\r\nblue ribbons, being a little given to finery. Although Susan Barndollar\r\nwas grown up and married, Mrs. Ferret had a child in the arms at that\r\ntime; and Jesse has even boasted, within the last five years, of running\r\ntwo cradles at one time.\r\n\r\nIt was on the evening of the seventh of September, the night before the\r\nmeeting at the Sycamore Spring, when Mrs. Ferret had a tea drinking in\r\nthe back parlor, at which I, the only one of the masculine, was present\r\nas a guest. Mrs. Younghusband was of the party, and Mrs. Snuffers, with\r\nher interesting fat female infant nine months old; the same dear child\r\nwhose arrangements to appear in this world of cares procured me the\r\nhonor of presiding over the New Light, on the memorable occasion of Mr.\r\nFlam's great speech at Christmas, whereof I have spoken in a former\r\nchapter: thanks to Mrs. Snuffers for that considerate favor! This good\r\nlady was there; and these two, with the addition of Miss Hardbottle,\r\nelder sister of Barndollar & Hardbottle, and Mrs. Susan Barndollar, who\r\nlived at home with her mother, made up the company.\r\n\r\n\"There is one thing,\" said Mrs. Ferret, as she rocked herself in a huge\r\nhickory arm-chair, which had been built on purpose for her, \"that I _do_\r\nhold in despise; and that is, one of these here men who haint got no\r\nopinions. Ef you believe me, Mrs. Snuffers, that man Jesse Ferret--this\r\nwoman's father, (pointing to Mrs. Barndollar,) God forgive me that I\r\nshould say anythink aginst my datur's own lawful flesh and blood!--but\r\nhe's actelly afeard to go down to-morrow to the Sycamore Spring to hear\r\nthe tongue-lashing which Theodore Fog, which is a man I always\r\nrespected--they say he drinks, but there's many a man which don't drink,\r\nhasn't half his brains--Jesse's actelly afeard to go and hear how\r\nTheodore will use up Ag Flag and Andy Grant both at the same time, least\r\nthey might be for making him take sides, which he hasn't the\r\nspunk to do. My patience! but it would be nuts to me to hear the\r\nspeechification!--and, to think of it--that man hasn't the heart of a\r\ngoose to go to the meeting!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Mrs. Ferret,\" said Mrs. Snuffers, talking as if she had a cold in\r\nthe head, her voice being husky, in fact, from having taken a\r\nlarge pinch of snuff, \"them politicks--them politicks! Poor Mr.\r\nSnuffers!--dear man: I 'spose you know he is President of the New Light;\r\nhe's losing his naiteral rest upon account of that split. He put in his\r\nwote in the conwention for Ag, as innocent as a lamb, and here comes up\r\nthat obstropolus iron railing, and smashes all the New Lights into outer\r\ndarkness, with diwisions and contentions and all sorts of infractions.\r\nMr. Snuffers says he shouldn't wonder if that unfortnate step should\r\ntake the Hay Scales from him and leave me and this here innocent darlin'\r\nbabe in a state of destitution. Oh them politicks!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let people stand by their colors, says I,\" interposed Mrs.\r\nBarndollar, tartly, with a sharp shake of her head; \"I go with my ma,\r\nalthough pa is pa. I think people ought to speak what they please, and\r\nmean what they please; and it's a mean thing not to do so, and that's\r\ngospel truth, or else this is not a free country. Ma is right; and if\r\nMr. Snuffers is what Mr. Barndollar calls a Whole Hog, he'll not mind\r\nthe people a jot, but go with his party; that's the law. And I don't\r\nagree by no means with ma, in going for Theodore against the\r\nnomination.\"\r\n\r\n\"Susan Barndollar, are you in earnest?\" inquired her affectionate ma.\r\n\"Who put it into your head to underrate and strangle down Theodore Fog,\r\nthe oldest friend we have had sence we came to Quodlibet? and who brings\r\nmore custom to our bar than the whole New-Light Club put together.\r\nSusan, Susan, I hope Jacob hain't been putting none of these ungrateful\r\nideers into your breast. Ef this house of ours, commonly called and\r\nknown by the name of The Hero, ought to go for any human, mortal,\r\nindividual man, that man is Theodore Fog. Ef he is a little exintric in\r\nregard of his drinking, it won't be no new think in the Legislater, ef\r\nthe tenth part of what I heerd is true. Ladies--tea,\" said the dame, as\r\nat this time a negro woman entered with a tray filled with great store\r\nof provender--\"help yourself, Mrs. Younghusband--take a plate on your\r\nknee, and fork up one of them warfields--and take care of your gown,\r\nthey're a dripping with butter. Mr. Secondthoughts, what under heaven\r\nhas become of your perliteness that you can see Mrs. Younghusband a\r\nfishing up that briled dried beef without her fork no more sticking in\r\nit than if it was a live eel in the gravy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind me, Mrs. Ferret,\" replied Mrs. Younghusband, \"and don't be a\r\ntroublin' the schoolmaster on my account. They do say that there's some\r\npersons as hard to catch and pin down as hung beef crisped and floating\r\nin butter, and as you justly remarked, a while ago, one of these persons\r\nis not a hundred miles off from this house:\" and here this good woman\r\nlaughed heartily at her own joke.\r\n\r\n\"Oh Jesse Ferret, in course!\" exclaimed the landlady.\r\n\r\n\"My pa!\" said Mrs. Barndollar, joining in the laugh.\r\n\r\n\"As Mr. Ferret hasn't got many friends here,\" said Miss Hardbottle,\r\n\"I'll be one. I think he is quite right, if he has no opinions, not to\r\nexpress them. Don't you think so, Mr. Secondthoughts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said I in a very grave manner, \"if I might be allowed to\r\nexpress myself freely, I would venture to remark, that it is very\r\nimportant to the ascendency of the New-Light Quodlibetarian Democratic\r\nparty, that there should be no strife nor division in our ranks; and\r\nthat, feeling the importance of this sentiment, it is one of our\r\nfundamental principles to go with the majority--whenever it can be\r\nascertained. Now between Agamemnon Flag and Theodore Fog----\"\r\n\r\n\"Theodore Fog is sich a _good_ creature!\" interrupted Mrs. Ferret.\r\n\r\n\"Ag is a _dear_ young man,\" said Mrs. Barndollar.\r\n\r\n\"As for that, ladies,\" said Miss Hardbottle, \"if you speak of goodness\r\nor beauty, Andy Grant can beat either, though he is a Whig.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hester Hardbottle!\" shouted Mrs. Ferret.\r\n\r\n\"Hester Hardbottle!\" shouted Mrs. Snuffers.\r\n\r\n\"Hester Hardbottle!\" shouted Mrs. Younghusband.\r\n\r\n\"Hester Hardbottle!\" shouted Mrs. Barndollar--all four at once.\r\n\r\n\"I do think so,\" said Miss Hardbottle, sharply, \"and what I do think, I\r\nsay.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have no right to say it, madam,\" said Mrs. Barndollar.\r\n\r\n\"Free country,\" said Miss Hardbottle.\r\n\r\n\"No such a thing for Whigs,\" quickly returned Mrs. Barndollar.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies! ladies! ladies!\" said I, \"peace, if you please:\" but there was\r\nno peace, for these excellent females soon got into such a state of\r\nconfusion in the attack and defense of Andy Grant, that I believe the\r\ntea-party would have broken up in a state of rebellion, if it had not\r\nbeen for the entrance of Mr. Ferret in the very height of the tumult.\r\nHis appearance gave another turn to the conversation, for it all turned\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n\"And so you are not going to the Sycamore Spring to-morrow,\" cried one.\r\n\r\n\"And I 'spose you won't vote for Theodore Fog,\" said Number Two.\r\n\r\n\"Nor for Ag Flag,\" said Number Three.\r\n\r\n\"But you will drop in a sly ticket for Andy Grant, may be, at last, ef\r\nno one should find you out,\" said Mrs. Ferret, who in this series\r\ncounted Number Four. \"Oh Jesse Ferret, ef you had a drop of blood in you\r\nthat wasn't milk-and-water, you would be ashamed of sich shilly-shally\r\nconduct, that even the women makes you a laughing-stock!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wife,\" said Jesse, taking a fierce stand in self-defense, \"drop it! If\r\nmy blood was milk-and-water, it would be curds-and-whey before this\r\ntime. I tell you again, old lady, a Publican's got no right to have\r\nsentiments. The party's double splitted, and no man knows which way to\r\nturn himself. There's that cursed Iron Railing; and there's that\r\ninfernal Suspension; and there's the Divorce of the Government from bed\r\nand board with the banks, that everybody's talking about; and there's\r\nPurse and Sword, and Specie Circlar, and Mint Drops, and the Lord knows\r\nwhat; that a poor, sinful, infallible tavern keeper doesn't know who's\r\nwho, and what's what. I'm sure I can't tell whether I'm on my head or my\r\nheels; and if I was to go down yonder to the Sycamore Spring and hear\r\nall the palavering there, I should get so flustrated I wouldn't know\r\nwhich eend of me went foremost. So, I tell you I'll stay at home and\r\nstick to my motto:--that's as good as if I swore to it. Solomon\r\nSecondthoughts, ain't I right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesse,\" said I, mildly, \"have you any respect for the opinion of our\r\ndistinguished representative, my former pupil, Middleton Flam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I voted for him,\" replied Jesse.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said I, \"I admit there is a great perplexity about all these\r\npublic measures and men, just at this time; and I am willing to allow\r\nthat the New-Light Democracy do not as yet exactly understand their own\r\nminds; and therefore it is quite lawful to pause and look about you\r\nbefore you take your stand. This thing is certain, that the New-Light\r\nDemocracy will undoubtedly go with the government, whatever line it\r\nchalks out for following the footsteps of its illustrious predecessor.\r\nWhether that line shall lead us North or South, East or West, my poor\r\nskill is not able to instruct you. Whether we are _for_ the banks or\r\n_against_ them, is yet undecided, since we are pledged at least in favor\r\nof our own. In a Quodlibetarian sense, I do not scruple to affirm that\r\nwe are _against_ the banks and _for_ the divorce; but in a private sense\r\nthat opinion will require some reflection. Mr. Flam will be home from\r\nCongress before long, and until then we shall suspend our opinion. We\r\nare, at all hazards, real Flam men. Flam--I drop the mister when I speak\r\nof him as a principle--is our polar star--our cynosure in politics--our\r\nPisgah, which gives us a view of the Promised Land. As a principle, our\r\nNew-Light Democracy is all out-and-out Flam. Flam is our father, our\r\nguide, our Pillar of Cloud. Wait till Middleton Flam comes home.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thrown out these well-weighed and sententious remarks, both for\r\nthe women and for Jesse, I was inwardly delighted to see how soothing\r\nwas the effect upon my auditory; and as it is a precept inculcated by\r\nsome sage observer of mankind, I forget his name, to leave your company\r\nwhen you have made an agreeable impression upon them, I did not tarry\r\nfor further converse, but took up my hat and stick, and bade my worthy\r\nfriends \"good night.\"\r\n\r\nUpon my return to my lodgings, I sat down and made the foregoing\r\nnarration of what had passed in my presence, and I have incorporated the\r\nsame into this history, with no little mortification; feeling myself\r\ncompelled thereto by the consideration that the scene I have described,\r\nbeing, as it were, the first fruits of that unhappy dissension which\r\ngrew up among the New Lights, and a significant commentary thereon, it\r\nmay serve in the way of warning to all good Quodlibetarian Democrats who\r\nmay chance to peruse these pages, against the folly of ever allowing\r\nthemselves to have any individual opinions, when the leaders and\r\nmarshals of the party shall have taken the trouble off their hands of\r\nthinking and determining for them. And, indeed, the moral may be carried\r\nfurther. For it is obvious, if Jesse Ferret had acted in the spirit and\r\nthe intelligence of a true Quod, he would have ascertained the majority\r\nand gone with it; instead of which, he intrenched himself behind this\r\nfortress of neutrality, comprehended in the absurd dogma that a Publican\r\nought to have no sides. Undoubtedly, the true precept should be in all\r\ncases of public servants, \"Take the upper side.\" Thereon chiefly hangs\r\nthe Quodlibetarian theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  GREAT MEETING AT THE SYCAMORE SPRING--SOME DESCRIPTION OF THE\r\n     ARRANGEMENTS--NICODEMUS HANDY CHOSEN TO PRESIDE ON THIS\r\n     OCCASION--MOTION TO THAT EFFECT BY MR. SNUFFERS--THIS WORTHY\r\n     GENTLEMAN'S MISFORTUNE--HIS ESCAPE--SUCCESSFUL ORGANIZATION\r\n     OF THE MEETING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 8th of September, Anno Domini 1837, was cloudless and\r\ncool. The dust had been laid by a shower of rain a little before\r\ndaylight, and the day therefore was auspicious to the wishes of all who\r\nproposed to assemble at the Sycamore Spring. By eight o'clock Ante\r\nMeridiem, Nicodemus Handy's barouche, with two beautiful bays, stood\r\nupon the gravel before Handy House on Copperplate Ridge. Agamemnon Flag,\r\nattired in a new blue coat with figured gilt buttons, white waistcoat,\r\nindia-rubber watch-guard, snowy pantaloons of very fine drilling, and\r\nboots of drab prunelle, tipped at the toes with polished French leather,\r\na watered-silk cravat, and gold spectacles, sat at the breakfast-table\r\nwith Mrs. Handy and Henrietta, her daughter--the smallest, the neatest,\r\nand the best-shaped female, it is said by those who pretend to be\r\njudges, in Quodlibet.\r\n\r\nNicodemus was in a flurry. He had swallowed his breakfast with great\r\ndispatch, and four servants were busily in attendance upon him. Sam, the\r\nwaiter, was beating time in the hall with a corn whisk alternately upon\r\nthe person of his master and his left hand, after a very favorite and\r\ningenious fashion of dusting a gentleman's coat, only known to and\r\npracticed by that musical race of colored dandies, of which Sam was a\r\nfirst-rate specimen. Sarah, a lady of Sam's complexion, Mrs. Handy's\r\nmaid, was running up stairs to sprinkle some verbena perfume on Mr.\r\nHandy's cambric handkerchief; William was smoothing the nap of his\r\nglossy-black Brewster with a brush as soft as silk; and Mrs. Trotter,\r\nthe housekeeper, was arranging a basket of sandwiches and a bottle of\r\nRudesheimer to be stowed away in the box of the back seat of the\r\nbarouche. The coachman, in a sky-blue frock, and hat with gold band\r\nsecured by a huge buckle, was in his seat holding the reins, every\r\nmoment speaking to the horses to make them restive, and then whipping\r\nthem for not standing still. The whole scene was one eminently\r\ncalculated to disprove that stale Whig slander which purports to affirm\r\nthat \"all the decency\" was in their ranks:--nothing could be more\r\nstriking than this refutation of it. And as I was myself present--having\r\ncalled in at that moment to deliver a message from the New-Light Club to\r\nMr. Handy, apprising him of their intention to move that he should act\r\nas chairman of the meeting to be held at the Sycamore Spring--I\r\nwitnessed with lively satisfaction the very decided impression of\r\npleasure made upon an assemblage of New Lights, who stood looking on\r\noutside of the front gate, by this triumphant vindication of our party\r\nfrom the malevolent insinuations of the Whig press.\r\n\r\nAgamemnon Flag seemed to be very much at his ease, and to be thinking\r\nbut little about the meeting, while he sat uttering some pleasant things\r\nto Miss Handy;--at least I suppose they must have been pleasant to her,\r\nas she and her mother both laughed a good deal at what he said.\r\nBy-the-by, there is a report in the Borough, that Ag is making up to\r\nthis young lady, which will be a grand thing for him if she favors him,\r\nsince she is an only child, and Nicodemus is amazingly rich.\r\n\r\n\"God bless me, my dear!\" said Mr. Handy, breaking away from Sam's whisk,\r\nand speaking after the manner of a table of contents, (a habit which he\r\nhas acquired since he has grown rich,) \"past eight o'clock--I'm to be\r\nthe chairman of that meeting--ought to be early on the ground--five\r\nmiles off--no time for nonsense now--you and Henrietta and Ag--have to\r\ndrive like lightning--barbacue, my dear--want to see the arrangements\r\nbefore the voters arrive--the schoolmaster will take a seat along side\r\nof Nace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you kindly,\" said I; \"I accept your offer with great pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shan't want William,\" he added, referring to the servant who generally\r\nrode with the coachman--\"upon second thoughts, will put _our_\r\nSecondthoughts inside--ha! ha!--_must_ have William--_shall_ want him;\r\nyou can sit (speaking to me) on the front seat--Ag and I behind--offer\r\nthe other seat to Barndollar--want to be civil to _him_, my dear--come,\r\nhurry, hurry, hurry!--William, get on your livery and be prepared to\r\nmount beside Nace.\"\r\n\r\nAs it was very manifest that Mr. Handy was really in a hurry--as very\r\nopulent men are exceedingly apt to be--there was of course a great\r\nbustle to accommodate him, by getting off. Agamemnon immediately rose\r\nfrom the breakfast-table, and, taking up his superfine Leghorn hat,\r\nwhich was very chastely adorned with a light yellow ribbon band, the\r\nends whereof hung a little over the rim, he put it gently on his head,\r\nand then standing before the ladies, asked them with very apparent\r\ncomplacency, whether they thought he was in good trim to appear before\r\nthe Democracy--and having received answer that \"he was exactly the\r\nthing,\" he signified his readiness to depart; whereupon we all bustled\r\nout to the barouche and took our seats. William clambered into his\r\nplace, and away we went at full trot, down to The Hero to take up Jacob\r\nBarndollar.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the tavern door, we found there Nim Porter's\r\ntrotting buggy with his stub-tailed gray. Nim himself appeared on the\r\nsteps in a big broad-brimmed low-crowned Russia blue hat, set very\r\nknowingly over his right eye, with a long taper whip in his hand; and\r\nbefore we could take up Mr. Barndollar, this most good natured of\r\nbar-keepers, with an agility not to be expected in so fat a person,\r\nsprang up into his tub-shaped seat, which held him about as compactly as\r\nthe shell of an acorn holds the nut, and spreading the skirts of his\r\ngreen coatee with steel buttons over the periphery of the same, darted\r\noff at a speed of about fifteen miles to the hour, down the Rumblebottom\r\nroad. During this time Mrs. Ferret filled the front door, and Mrs.\r\nBarndollar was looking over her shoulder, while they both opened their\r\nbatteries upon poor Jesse Ferret, in a contemporaneous objurgation of\r\nhis mean-spiritedness, addressed to Mr. Handy in the barouche, but\r\nintended for the master of the hotel, who looked rather sheepishly\r\nthrough the window of the bar-room. Before he could say anything in his\r\nown defense, and even before the amiable ladies of his family were done\r\ntalking, Jacob Barndollar came out, and got into the barouche; and as\r\nMr. Handy was growing more and more impatient, he ordered Nace to lose\r\nno time, and so off we started. As well as I could judge, from looking\r\nback, until we turned down by Christy M'Curdy's mill, Mrs. Ferret was\r\nstill arguing her case in the front door of The Hero.\r\n\r\nAll the roads leading to the Sycamore Spring were filled with persons\r\non horseback, on foot, in gigs, buggies, barouches, and rattle-traps of\r\nevery sort. It was obvious we were going to have a great meeting. Before\r\nnine o'clock, Mr. Handy was on the ground. About a hundred persons were\r\nalready there. Booths were scattered along under the huge elms and\r\nsycamores which shaded a low flat upon the margin of the Rumblebottom.\r\nThe fine, copious, old spring--where there has been many a barbacue in\r\nmy time--was pouring out its crystal treasures, as some poet says, with\r\nprodigal bounty, and transferring them, as the Secretary does the\r\ndeposits, by large draughts, from the living rock to the running\r\nRumblebottom--in fact, taking them out of one bank, and distributing\r\nthem between others. Not far from this spring, adumbrated by\r\nover-arching boughs--the reader will excuse this poetical orgasm--for\r\nfifteen years and upwards have I been visiting this fountain, sacred to\r\nPan, (we used to have fish frys here,) and have ever grown poetical at\r\nthe sight thereof--it is my infirmity: not far from the spring stood the\r\ntables--boards on trestles, and on the boards trenchers filled with\r\ncubic sections of beef, lamb, mutton, and ham, interspersed with\r\npyramids of bread--a goodly sight! Upon skids, remote from the tables,\r\nstood a barrel of old Monongahela, and hard by in a cart, tumblers,\r\npitchers, noggins, and bottles. Far off, at the opposite confine of this\r\nfield of action, was a stage erected, with a chair for the President of\r\nthe day, and benches of unplaned board for persons of inferior dignity.\r\nEverything was in order; and now that Mr. Handy had arrived he had\r\nnothing to do but wait for the gathering in of the people.\r\n\r\nPresently Mr. Grant, mounted on a large bow-necked bay, arrived, with\r\nhis four sons, all men grown, of a rustic, farmer-like complexion; they\r\nwere attended by Augustus Postlethwaite Tompkinson, of The Whole Team,\r\nand some dozen Whigs from Thorough Blue, who had traveled as far as Mr.\r\nGrant's the night before, and now made a very solid and formidable\r\ntroop. Andrew Grant, the candidate, a youth of good presence, and\r\nreputable, (bating his politics,) was of this party. Andy had been to\r\ncollege, and his father first intended to make a doctor of him, but the\r\nlad somehow took a dislike to physic, and turned in to this new business\r\nof engineering on canals and railroads, and was considered, I believe, a\r\ntolerably smart hand in that calling. But as he happened to catch a\r\nbilious fever in the Dismal Swamp, the old lady his mother, who always\r\nhad made a pet of him, would not hear of his going back to that line of\r\nlivelihood; and so he stayed at home helping to manage at the Hogback\r\nfarm, and doing pretty much as _he_ pleased; until, about a year before\r\nhe was brought out, he married Stephen P. Crabstock's daughter; and ever\r\nsince that event does as his _wife_ pleases--spending his time one part\r\nof the year at the Iron Works, and the other at the old man's.\r\n\r\nBy eleven o'clock the company had pretty nearly got to its maximum. A\r\nlarge party came down in a wagon from Quodlibet with Abel Brawn--among\r\nthem Neal Hopper, Sandy Buttercrop, Davy Post the wheelwright, and I\r\ncan't tell how many more. Quipes, the painter, borrowed a horse out of\r\nGeoffry Wheeler's team, and was there studying human nature and the\r\npicturesque. Flan Sucker, one-eyed Ben Inky, and Jeff Drinker, with a\r\nsquad of regular loafers, came on foot. The Tumbledownians were there in\r\ngreat force under Cale Goodfellow, to help Theodore Fog; and the\r\nBickerbrayians with Virgil Philpot, the editor of The Scrutinizer,\r\nmustered a heavy phalanx in favor of Ag Flag. To swell the assemblage to\r\nits largest compass, there were about fifty laborers from the\r\nnewly-begun Bickerbray and Meltpenny Railroad, a worthy accession to the\r\nNew-Light Democracy, who had about a month before this meeting come into\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nThis is a hasty glance over the field of action, and will serve to show\r\nthat the country was all alive to the importance of the occasion and\r\nduly estimated the nature of the crisis. Looking over this congregation\r\nI, as one having knowledge therein, may safely affirm, that the genuine\r\nQuods present fully outnumbered the Whigs three to one. Eliphalet Fox,\r\nwho has been more accustomed to measure crowds, however, after a minute\r\ninspection of the various groups, judging by that tact which he says\r\nnever failed him in discriminating between what he calls a Loco Foco and\r\na Whig, (he does not pretend to say that he is so expert in pointing out\r\na New Light, but as to a Loco he asserts he is perfect,) set down the\r\nnumber at nearer ten to one; and accordingly so reported it in the\r\naccount of the meeting which afterwards appeared in The Whole Hog.\r\nWithout, however, dwelling upon this topic, let us proceed to the\r\nbusiness of the day.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock dinner was announced; and this army of hungry\r\npoliticians, with a unanimity of sentiment, an accord of principle, and\r\na concert of action, which we might in vain seek for in other\r\noccupations of a political nature, combined, like a band of brothers, to\r\ndevour the largest possible amount of the stores which lay before them.\r\nWith somewhat less agreement they made their advances to the\r\nMonongahela; the more shy of the assemblage being rather kept at bay by\r\nthe remarkable perseverance and adhesiveness of Flan Sucker, one-eyed\r\nBen Inky, and a chosen body of troops under their command, who had\r\nconstituted themselves the forlorn hope in this assault. Still, as the\r\nnewspapers say when they are disposed to puff a popular play, the barrel\r\nwent off very much to the satisfaction, and, indeed, the delight of the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThese matters being dispatched, Nicodemus Handy, who during the repast\r\nhad acted inimitably the part of a perfectly ravenous man, but who\r\nhaving an eye to the sandwiches and Rudesheimer, made his appetite\r\nrather a matter of \"seems,\" rapped upon the table, and called upon every\r\nman to fill up his glass; which order was faithfully obeyed by Flan\r\nSucker & Company, a firm that was in possession of all the tumblers--the\r\nremainder of the guests allowing the filling to be, as we say in\r\ngrammar, \"understood,\"--and then offered the following toast, which, as\r\nhe said, would speak for itself:--\"The several candidates who are about\r\nto address the people--success to him who shall best deserve it!\" Sucker\r\n& Company drained to the bottom, and then set up a shrill yell, very\r\nmuch in the style of the Winnebagoes, except that there was a running\r\nnote of \"Yip!\" that was distinctively Suckerian.\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen, to the stand!\" cried out Mr. Handy.\r\n\r\nBut before the crowd obeyed this order, Mr. Snuffers had a motion to\r\nmake. It was a matter of some importance, as the subject was considered\r\nin the New-Light Club, that our party should have the President of the\r\nday--and it was therefore determined that the moment dinner was over,\r\nand before the Whigs might be aware of it, Mr. Snuffers, the head of our\r\nclub, should rise in some conspicuous place, and move that Nicodemus\r\nHandy be requested to preside over the meeting. Mr. Snuffers is a slow\r\nand nervous man, and was admonished to be on his guard, so as to make\r\nsure of getting ahead of the Whigs who we knew wanted Mr. Grant in the\r\nchair. He was in consequence very fidgety all the time of dinner; and\r\nnow, when the moment for action arrived, the good old gentleman elbowed\r\nhis way toward the center of the table, and without difficulty succeeded\r\nin clambering upon an inverted and empty flour-barrel, which had once\r\nbeen filled with bread. \"I move, gentlemen,\" said he, with a tremulous\r\nand agitated voice--\"I move, gentlemen, that Mr. Nicodemus Handy----\"\r\n\r\nBefore the next word escaped from his lips, this worthy and respectable\r\nold gentleman broke in, and in an instant (I am shocked to tell it) was\r\njammed up tight in the barrel--disappearing as a dip of twenty to the\r\npound is apt to do when stuck into a black bottle--\"be President of this\r\nmeeting,\" said Mr. Doubleday, with a hurried utterance, taking up the\r\nword which was lost with Mr. Snuffers, and which, but for the admirable\r\npresence of mind of our Vice, might have been lost forever.\r\n\r\n\"Break the barrel to pieces!\" cried out forty voices.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Snuffers is blue in the face--he will die of apoplexy,\" cried out\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\"An ax!--knock the barrel to pieces!\" shouted more, in great alarm at\r\nhis precarious situation.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments our distressed and worthy President of the New Light\r\nwas extricated from his unpleasant durance, and finding no harm done, we\r\nproceeded to take the question on the motion. Mr. Handy was thus called\r\nto the chair. Nine Vice-Presidents were appointed, and six Secretaries\r\nto record the proceedings. These matters being arranged, the whole\r\nassemblage moved toward the rostrum at the opposite end of the wood.\r\n\r\nWhat followed we shall read in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  SCENES AT THE SYCAMORE SPRING--NICODEMUS HANDY'S SPEECH AS\r\n     PRESIDENT--SKETCH OF ANDREW GRANT'S SPEECH--AGAMEMNON\r\n     FLAG'S--ATTEMPTS AT INTERRUPTION--THEODORE FOG'S CELEBRATED\r\n     SPEECH ON THIS OCCASION--ELOQUENT EXPOSITION OF\r\n     PRINCIPLES--HIS TRIUMPH--HIS MISFORTUNE--QUIPES'S\r\n     DISAPPOINTMENT OF HIS FRIENDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the crowd had gathered around the stand appropriated to the\r\nPresident, the nine Vice-Presidents, and the six Secretaries, besides\r\nthe speakers who were to address the meeting, and when every officer was\r\nin his place, Nicodemus Handy came forward with his pocket-handkerchief\r\nin his hand, wiping from his brow the perspiration, which naturally\r\nbreaks out on a man of sensibility and wealth when called to discharge\r\nthe honorable and responsible function of presiding over a vast\r\nconcourse of freemen. By way of digression, I would take this occasion\r\nto remark upon the extreme appropriateness of the phrase which is now\r\nuniversally used in describing meetings of the people, and which always\r\nrefers to them as _freemen_. Ever since the people have been drilled to\r\nwalk in the way appointed for them by the leaders of their respective\r\nparties, and are so liberally told how they must think, speak, and vote;\r\nand when no man is allowed to walk out of that path without being\r\nthreatened with condign punishment, it is extremely proper, in order to\r\navoid odious imputations which malevolent observers might cast upon\r\nthem, on all occasions to employ the phrase I have alluded to; since, if\r\nthis were neglected, these malevolent observers might take it into their\r\nheads to call the people of our free Republic Tools, Instruments,\r\nRank-and-File, and other names significant of a state of subserviency,\r\nwhich in the eyes of strangers might cast discredit on our free\r\ninstitutions: even the _officers_ of our government might be branded\r\nwith the name of _hirelings_ and _servants_, and an opinion might thus\r\nbe fostered that, instead of being the freest nation upon earth, we\r\nwere a set of slaves governed by a set of hired servants--a most\r\nunwarrantable, unjust, and derogatory conclusion. For this reason, I am\r\nparticular in the language above employed, and I think that every\r\ngenuine Quod will see the value and the force of my vindication and use\r\nof this phrase.\r\n\r\nMr. Handy rose to his feet, wiped his brow, and made a graceful\r\nobedience to the assembled body of freemen.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, with a most laudable diffidence, in a voice which\r\nnot more than fifteen persons, exclusive of the nine Vices and six\r\nSecretaries, could hear; \"sensible of the great honor--endeavor to\r\ndischarge with fidelity--obvious incapacity--but exceedingly flattered\r\nby the testimony of your confidence;\" then wiping his brow, still more\r\nvehemently, with his cambric handkerchief rolled up like a snow-ball, he\r\ncontinued: \"It falls to my lot to introduce to you our distinguished\r\nfriends, Agamemnon Flag, Andrew Grant, and Theodore Fog, Esquires, men\r\nof whom any land may be proud--they will speak for themselves. With such\r\nmen to choose from, our country cannot fail to rise up to the\r\nvery midnight of prosperity, honor, and renown. Thanks for your\r\nattention--rely upon your indulgence--Mr. Grant will lead off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three cheers for Nicodemus Handy!\" cried out several Quods, as soon as\r\nour distinguished townsman took his seat; and, thereupon, about twenty\r\nheads were uncovered, and the twenty throats appurtenant to the same\r\ngave the three rounds called for.\r\n\r\nAndrew Grant now came forward, and made a discourse of about an hour's\r\nlength. It was in the usual style of the Whigs, and began with an\r\nattempt to raise an impression that the country, notwithstanding General\r\nJackson's express declaration to the contrary, given to the nation under\r\nthe solemn sanction of a presidential message, and notwithstanding his\r\nsuccessor's certificate to the same effect, was in a state of difficulty\r\nand distress. This young man, not more than twenty-five years of age,\r\nliving in comparative obscurity, had the hardihood, in the face of a\r\nlarge and respectable body of freemen, to contradict the word of two\r\nPresidents of the United States! Then, after coloring this picture of\r\nadversity with all imaginable hues of shade, he did not scruple to\r\naffirm that the whole of these fancied embarrassments were brought on by\r\nthe _folly_, as he termed it, of our rulers--charged the great\r\nDemocratic majority of the nation with having carried bad measures\r\nthrough Congress--said the Whigs had warned us of the results of these\r\nmeasures--and even went to the point of asserting that the suspension of\r\nthe banks was the consequence of the acts of the party in power. To make\r\nout this absurd proposition, he read extracts from the speeches of Whig\r\nmembers, against the removal of the deposits, to show what he called\r\ntheir prophecies of disaster to the people; then actually affirmed that\r\nthe experiment of General Jackson upon the Currency had failed, and that\r\nall the Whig predictions had come true; and after sundry excursions into\r\nthe Hard Money and State-Bank systems of the administration, finally\r\nwound up his remarks by a very fatiguing enumeration of the General's\r\npledges to the people before his election, and his changes of opinion\r\nupon these subjects afterward;--in regard to which he produced and read\r\ncertain long-winded documents from the President and Secretaries, to the\r\ngreat annoyance of our Quods, who, in fact, became so tired of this\r\nimpertinent matter, that not more than half a dozen of them remained\r\nwithin hearing of the speaker, the great bulk of them having gone over\r\nto the spring to refresh themselves in a more agreeable manner.\r\nEliphalet Fox very aptly remarked, immediately after this long prosing\r\nwas brought to an end, that the speech was a _perfect failure_: he had\r\nheard Andy Grant spoken of as a young man of talents, but he turns out\r\nto be a miserable take-in. \"Nothing in him, sir!\" said Eliphalet, in his\r\nterse way; \"nothing in him, sir!\"\r\n\r\nThe Whigs, as is usual with them, affected to be hugely delighted.\r\nAugustus Postlethwaite Tompkinson took pencil-notes and announced his\r\npurpose to publish the speech entire. \"A great speech that,\" said he to\r\nMr. Snuffers--\"extraordinary young man!--great speech.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Handy now lost no time in presenting Agamemnon Flag, who came\r\nforward with a confident, self-possessed air, smiling through his gold\r\nspectacles, and apparently very much delighted at the opportunity of\r\npresenting himself before his fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n\"I see before me,\" said he, in a clear, fine-toned voice, and with an\r\naffable manner, \"a vast concourse of----\"\r\n\r\n\"Put on your hat,\" cried out three or four from the crowd, upon\r\nobserving that a sunbeam had straggled through the foliage and lit up\r\nAgamemnon's yellow, curly locks, likening them to golden wire.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, my friends,\" said the orator, stepping one pace to the right\r\nand thus bringing himself into the shade, \"in the presence of the\r\nsovereign people, I always stand uncovered, regardless of the exposure\r\nof my person.\"\r\n\r\nThis happy sally brought forth a long and loud clapping of hands from\r\nthe great multitude of Quods, who, the moment Andy Grant had finished\r\nspeaking, had crowded back to the stand.\r\n\r\n\"Take off your goold specs, Ag; let's see your Dimmycratic phiz out and\r\nout!\" said Flan Sucker at the top of his voice, from the outskirts of\r\nthe assemblage.\r\n\r\nA loud laugh that shook full one hundred diaphragms, followed this\r\ndemand, and Agamemnon good-naturedly took off his glasses.\r\n\r\n\"Anything to oblige you, gentlemen,\" said he; \"but as I am very\r\nshort-sighted, I deprive myself of the pleasure of a better view of my\r\nworthy fellow-citizens.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put on your specs, Ag,\" said Nim Porter--\"never mind Flan Sucker!\"\r\n\r\n\"Put on your specs!\" cried out the whole of the convention who had\r\nnominated the ticket, backed by a number of their friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blast his eyes!\" said Cale Goodfellow, turning to his Tumbledownians,\r\nwho were all friends of Fog, and of course opposed to the nomination.\r\n\"Let's have a representative who can _see_ what he is about--none of\r\nyour goold daylights!\"\r\n\r\n\"Specs or no specs, go it!--Yip!\" shouted Flan. Sucker, with a voice\r\nthat rang like a trumpet.\r\n\r\n\"Or-der!--Or-der!\" said Mr. Handy, rising from his seat and coming\r\nforward beside the speaker, and waving his hand to the crowd, greatly\r\nconcerned to see these manifestations of dissension in the ranks of the\r\nparty. \"Gentlemen, it is but fair that every man should be heard, and\r\nthe chair takes occasion to say, that it is mortified at these\r\ninterruptions. If the gentlemen opposed to the nomination--the chair\r\nalludes to those who have unfortunately allowed themselves to be\r\ninfluenced by the iron railing, a subject which has nothing upon earth\r\nto do with the pending election--if these gentlemen are not disposed to\r\ngive Mr. Agamemnon Flag an opportunity of delivering himself, the chair\r\nwould invite such persons to reflect upon the obvious impropriety of\r\nsuch a course. The chair is persuaded that this disturbance results from\r\nmere want of reflection, and hopes it shall not be required again to\r\nremind gentlemen of the courtesy due to Mr. Flag.\"\r\n\r\nAs Virgil describes in that notable passage, the subduing of the rage\r\nof popular commotion by AEneas, and likens it to the mandate of Neptune\r\nquelling the waves of old ocean, so fell Mr. Handy's timely reproof upon\r\nthe Anti-iron Railings, and, in a moment, all was still. Agamemnon then\r\nbegan again in his original track.\r\n\r\n\"I see before me a vast concourse of free citizens--the solid,\r\nsubstantial, durable, permanent, everlasting pillars of free government.\r\nThe honest, upright, pure, hard-handed, horny-fisted, Democratic\r\nyeomanry of the country are here--not the flesh and blood of the\r\ncountry, for that is the pampered aristocracy--but the bone and sinew\r\nsurround me. It rejoices my eyes to behold these honest, sturdy,\r\nindependent, intelligent, invincible tillers of the soil--these brawny,\r\nunconquerable, liberty-loving working-men--I say, sir, I delight to look\r\nupon them; my feeble vision, sir----\"\r\n\r\n\"Put on your specs, Ag!\" shouted Ben Inky and Flan Sucker again, at the\r\nsame instant;--and the cry was echoed from various quarters.\r\n\r\nSome moments of disorder again prevailed, which required the second\r\ninterposition of Mr. Handy, who, in the most spirited manner, proclaimed\r\nhis positive determination to resign, unless the order of the meeting\r\ncould be preserved. \"I will never consent,\" said he, with a most\r\nlaudable energy, \"to hold any post, executive or representative, for one\r\nmoment after I shall have discovered that I do not possess the\r\nconfidence of the people; the chair must feel itself compelled, by every\r\nsentiment which, as a friend of the New-Light Democracy, it holds dear,\r\nto resign the moment it finds that it has fallen into a minority.\" Then\r\nfollowed these remarkable words:--\"Sustain me, Quodlibetarians, or let\r\nme go!\"\r\n\r\nFor full five minutes after this, the uproar was tremendous. The Iron\r\nRailings and Anti-iron Railings almost came to blows. The Tumbledownians\r\nand Bickerbrayians took their appropriate sides in the contest, and, for\r\na space, nothing was heard but shouts of Fog!--Flag!--Fog!--Flag! over\r\nthe whole field. When both parties had bawled themselves perfectly\r\nhoarse, and for mere want of wind ceased the clamor, Theodore Fog\r\nmounted the hustings, and made a special request of his friends to keep\r\nthe peace and hear Mr. Flag to an end. He put this request upon the\r\nground of a personal favor to himself, and promised them that, at the\r\nproper time, they should hear his sentiments very fully upon all the\r\nagitating questions of the day.\r\n\r\nThis appeal was conclusive, and Mr. Flag once more presented himself.\r\nBut the interruptions he had suffered seemed most unhappily to have\r\nthrown him entirely out of gear; and becoming very much embarrassed, he\r\nstruggled for some moments to regain his self-possession, as I thought,\r\nwithout success--although Fox thought otherwise,--and, after less than\r\nhalf an hour's speaking, sat down, rather crest-fallen and mortified.\r\n\r\nI may unwittingly do Mr. Flag injustice in this remark; for, in truth,\r\nmy mind was greatly occupied with the tumult, and I confess I was,\r\ntherefore, not a very attentive listener. Fox, on the contrary, was\r\nminutely observant of the speech, and did not scruple to pronounce it a\r\nmasterly effort of eloquence, calculated to place Mr. Flag beside the\r\nfirst statesmen of our country. This was his opinion at the time, and it\r\nwas even more warmly and eulogistically expressed subsequently, in The\r\nWhole Hog, where the speech appeared in nine closely-printed columns on\r\nthe following Saturday.\r\n\r\nTheodore Fog was always a great favorite at our public meetings, and the\r\nmoment now approached when the field was to be surrendered to him. The\r\nNew Lights, including the members of the nominating convention and the\r\nfriends of the Iron Railing Compromise, backed by Virgil Philpot of The\r\nScrutinizer, and a large force of Bickerbrayians, were determined that\r\nAgamemnon Flag should not want a very decisive token of applause; and\r\nthey accordingly called out for \"nine cheers for the regular candidate!\"\r\nResponsive to this call, their whole party lustily set about the work;\r\nand, for some minutes after the conclusion of Agamemnon's speech, the\r\nair resounded with huzzas for \"Flag and the Constitution!\" \"New Light\r\nand Regular Nomination!\" This was answered by a round for \"Fog and\r\nReform!\" \"Retrenchment and no Iron Railing!\" and Fog, in the midst of\r\nthis acclamation, appearing on the speaker's stand, all cries were lost\r\nin the most violent clapping of hands.\r\n\r\nTheodore Fog's figure is about six feet, lean and bony, and with a\r\nstoop which inclines a little to the right, so as to bring his left\r\nshoulder somewhat higher than its opposite. His arms are unusually long,\r\nhis head small, his face strongly furrowed with deep lines, his eyes of\r\na greenish luster, his nose decidedly of the pug species, his mouth\r\nlarge, his complexion of that sallow, drum-head, parchment hue that\r\nequally defies the war of the elements, and the ravages of alcohol.\r\nAlthough short of fifty years of age, his hair is iron gray, and spreads\r\nin a thick mat over his whole cranium. At no time of life has he been\r\ncareful of dress, but now has declined into an extreme of negligence in\r\nthis particular. On the present occasion, he wore a striped gingham\r\ncoat, rather short in the sleeves, and cross-barred pantaloons; his\r\nshirt collar was turned down over a narrow, horsehair stock; and a broad\r\nblack ribbon guard crossed his breast and terminated in the right pocket\r\nof a black bombazet waistcoat, where it was plainly to be seen from the\r\nexternal impression, lodged a large watch. He presented himself to the\r\nmultitude, holding in his hand a rather shabby straw hat, which he,\r\nnevertheless, flourished with the air and grace of one who had known\r\nbetter days than his habiliments seemed to denote.\r\n\r\nHe stood for some time bowing and waving his hat in return for the\r\nclamorous approbation with which he was greeted; and when, at length,\r\nsilence was restored, he began his speech.\r\n\r\n\"Countrymen and friends: you of Quodlibet, Bickerbray, Tumbledown and\r\nthe adjacent parts, hear me! I am an old, tried and trusty, unflinching\r\nand unterrified Quodlibetarian New-Light Democrat--Flan Sucker, bring us\r\na tumbler of water--tangle it, Flan: no hypocrisy in me, gentlemen,--I\r\ngo for the ardent. You all know I am, and was from the first, opposed to\r\nthe iron railing--(here arose a cheer from the Anties)--but I don't\r\ncome to talk to you about that. You know, moreover, that I am an\r\nanti-nomination man--I'm out on independent grounds--every man for\r\nhimself, as the jackass said to the chickens--(a loud laugh.) I want to\r\nsay a word about Agamemnon Flag--commonly called Ag Flag. Who's he? Look\r\nat them gold spectacles, and you will see what he is at once. When the\r\nplastic hand of Dame Nature set about the fabrication of that\r\nmasterpiece of human mechanism, a genuine, out-and-out thorough-stiched\r\nNew-Light Democrat, she never thought of sticking upon him a\r\nnose to be ridden by two gold rings hung over it like a pair of\r\nsaddlebags--(loud laughter.) We have other uses for our gold; we want\r\nit for mint-drops--old Tom Benton's mint-drops--to be run up into\r\nthem, to give the honest, poor man something better, when his week's\r\nwork is done, than Copperplate Bank rags, signed Nicodemus Handy--(loud\r\nshouts and cheers from Flan Sucker's squad and the Tumbledowns; and\r\ngroans and hisses from the Convention men and Bickerbrays.) Friends, I\r\ntell you, our party is split; emphatically split. I have seen this\r\ncoming for some time. We have three sets of New Lights among us, and it\r\nis time we should know it. There are THE MANDARINS, our big bugs, and I\r\ncould name them to you. You will find them on Copperplate Ridge--('Bah!\r\nbah!' from the New-Light Club--'Go it The! go it, old fellow!' from\r\nthe Anties.) You will find them at Popular Flats--('That won't do!'\r\ncried fifty voices; 'three cheers for the Hon. Middleton Flam!'--loud\r\ncheering for Flam: 'Walk into them, Fog!' from the Anties--great\r\nlaughter and rubbing of hands among the Whigs.) You will find them in\r\nthe Forwarding and Commission Line--(great uproar on all sides.)\r\nAfter the Mandarins, come THE MIDDLINGS; and after the Middlings,\r\nTHE TRUE GRITS--the hearty, whole-souled, no-mistake Quods. I'm a\r\nTRUE GRIT!--(great applause.) We are nature's noblemen--give\r\nme that water, Flan. I call myself one of the Royal Family of\r\nthe Sovereign People--(renewed laughter and applause.) I am no\r\nkid-glove-MANDARIN-Democrat: I am no milk-and-water, flesh-and-fowl,\r\nhalf-hawk-half-buzzard-MIDDLING-Democrat: I am, to all intents and\r\npurposes, toties quoties, in puris naturalibus, a TRUE GRIT, a whole\r\nTRUE GRIT, and nothing but a TRUE GRIT.--(Here Theodore was obliged to\r\npause a full minute on account of the cheering.)\r\n\r\n\"Now this brings me,\" he continued after drinking off the potation which\r\nFlan Sucker had assiduously placed upon the stand for his use, \"to Andy\r\nGrant. Andy Grant has told you a great deal about General Jackson's\r\npledges, and his changes and whatnot. Well, sirs, he _did_ change--what\r\nof it? Is Democracy like the laws of the Medes and Persians? Is that\r\ngreat sublime truth which vivifies the patriot's heart, resuscitates his\r\nambition and sparkles in the human breast, like a stone in the bottom of\r\na well, for toads to sit on? or is it the divine rainbow spanning the\r\nearth with its arch, and changing with the sun, now in the east, now in\r\nthe west? Is it a post set up in a stream for the liquid element of\r\nhuman policy forever to roll by and leave behind? or is it the mighty\r\nmass of steam power that not only floats upon that element, but flies\r\nonward across the great ocean of mortal things forever changing in its\r\ncareer? Is not Democracy itself the march of intellect? and does not\r\nmarching consist in change of place? I hear you all answer, with one\r\naccord, Ay, ay, ay!--(Taking the word from the orator, there was a loud\r\naffirmative response to these questions.)\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, Jackson did change. He was _for_ the single term--he was\r\n_against_ it: I confess the fact. He was _for_ the Protective System--he\r\nwas _against_ it: I agree to it. He was _for_ a National Bank--he was\r\n_against_ it: what of that? He was _for_ the distribution of the\r\nsurplus, and again he was _against_ it; I know it. He was _for_ Internal\r\nImprovements;--he changed his mind--he was _against_ them. Then\r\nagain, sirs, he was _against_ the interference of officers in the\r\nelections;--he was sorry for it, and took the other tack. He was\r\n_against_ the appointment of members of Congress--in theory;--in\r\npractice he was _for_ it. He was _against_ this Sub-Treasury--and\r\nperhaps he is now _for_ it. It is all true, as Andy Grant has told\r\nyou:--it is in the documents, I don't deny it. Sirs, it is the glory of\r\nhis character that he has been _for_ and _against_ everything;--and as\r\nMr. Van Buren promises to follow in his footsteps, he, of course, will\r\nbe for and against everything--I know him. He would not be a genuine New\r\nLight, if he were not. We are all (and here Fog raised his voice to the\r\nhighest key, and struck the board sharply with his hand) FOR and AGAINST\r\neverything! How else can we be with the majority? What is the New-Light\r\nQuodlibetarian Democracy, but a strict conformity to the will of the\r\nmajority? Against that and that only we never go!--(tremendous\r\napplause.) As Levi Beardsly said, Perish Commerce, Perish Credit!--and I\r\nsay, Perish Currency, Banks, Sub-Treasury, Constitution, Law, Benton,\r\nAmos, Van--I had almost said perish Old Hickory--but _always_ go with\r\nthe MAJORITY!\"\r\n\r\nAfter this burst, which may be said to be truly eloquent, Theodore made\r\na very happy hit in touching upon the natural hostility between the\r\n_rich_ and the _poor_, showing, with great point of remark, how\r\nimpossible it was for these two classes to have any Christian feelings\r\ntoward each other; and arguing from that the great New-Light Democratic\r\nprinciple, that in every department of the government any man who holds\r\nproperty ought to be deprived of all influence, and that it was the poor\r\nman's right to legislate away the rich man's possessions. \"Do we not\r\nknow,\" said he, \"that in every community the majority are poor? that\r\nthere are two men without property for every one man with it? Of course\r\nthen, it follows logically, that, as two heads are better than one, the\r\nsole right, as well as the sole power of legislation is in the poor, and\r\nthat they may make laws for the government of the rich; but the rich\r\ncannot make laws for the government of the poor. Besides, who would be\r\nthe most impartial in such a matter, the man legislating for his _own_\r\nproperty, or the man legislating for his _neighbor's_? This requires no\r\nreply.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the subject of the Sub-Treasury, Fog avowed boldly his\r\nnon-commitalism. \"I am not sure, at this moment,\" said he, \"how the land\r\nlies. I wait to ascertain the sentiment of the majority, which, without\r\ntaking sides, I rather incline to think is against the measure. I judge\r\nfrom the vote of the New Lights two years ago--although, I confess, that\r\ntwo years are a long period for a New Light to look back, and that it is\r\nrather over the usual time in which custom requires we should change. _I\r\nshall wait for events._\"\r\n\r\nThere were other subjects embraced in this speech, upon which my\r\nmemoranda are imperfect; but there was one part of it, toward the\r\nconclusion, which was very pathetic.\r\n\r\nThe orator turned to those strangers among us who had come over from the\r\nBickerbray and Meltpenny Railroad. \"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"you stand in a\r\npeculiarly interesting relation to the New Lights. You are strangers,\r\nand, as the poet says,\r\n\r\n  'Stranger is a sacred name.'\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is our wish to take you in. You have not been over sixty\r\ndays in our State: you are separated, many of you, from your\r\nsweethearts--some of you from your wives--all of you from your\r\nhomes:--wife--sweetheart--home! Affecting words!\r\n\r\n  'Where is the man with soul so dead\r\n  Who never to himself hath said,\r\n    This is my own, my native land?' and so forth.\"\r\n\r\nHere Theodore took up his red pocket-handkerchief, which was already\r\nwell saturated with the sweat of his brow, and feelingly wiped his eyes\r\nfor some moments, manifestly overcome by his emotions. At length he\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\n\"Do not despond, gentlemen--do not despair. The New Lights are your\r\nfriends, and not only shall you find wife, sweetheart, home--ay, and\r\nchildren, in Quodlibet, but if you are here next month, we will see if\r\nsome of you are not entitled to a vote--that's all.--I have no doubt a\r\nlarge portion of your respectable body are better voters than you think\r\nyou are. And at all events, if you are not, it becomes us as a Christian\r\npeople to extend to you that privilege. I go for the repeal of all laws\r\nwhich tyrannically require a year's residence in the State, before a\r\nstranger is allowed to vote.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurra for Fog--hurra for Fog!\" burst forth in loud chorus from the\r\nnew-comers.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Theodore in continuation, \"as I scorn concealment, I must be\r\nfrank with you. The stranger should be grateful to his friends; and I,\r\ntherefore, for one, never can consent to extend the invaluable\r\nprivilege of suffrage to an unworthy man. He must be a New Light,\r\nan ardent, unblenching Quodlibetarian Democrat, ready to go in\r\nwhatever way we who take the trouble to do his thinking for him,\r\nrequire;--it is but reasonable. We think, study, burn the midnight\r\nlamp, and toil, when he sleeps, and all for the good of the man who\r\nhas no time to do these things for himself--what is his duty in\r\nreturn? Why, to stand by _us_ who make these sacrifices for his\r\nwelfare--clearly--undoubtedly--incontestably.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurra for Fog!\" again rose in hoarse reduplications on the air.\r\n\r\n\"And now, fellow-countrymen, one and all--men of Quodlibet, men of\r\nBickerbray--and especially men of Old Tumbledown, long my home, and\r\nnever absent from my heart--I have exposed to you frankly, freely,\r\nunhesitatingly my principles and professions.--You see me as I\r\nam--naked, guileless, and robed in the simplicity of my nature.--Flan,\r\nanother glass of that stuff, my boy. I do not imitate my friend Andy\r\nGrant--for he _is_ my friend--we can differ in politics and break no\r\nscores!--I do not, like him and the Whigs, entertain you with frothy\r\ndeclamation, appealing to your passions or your prejudices--I scorn such\r\nstratagems.--No, I address myself solely and severely, sternly, without\r\na flower, prosaically, without a figure, soberly, without a flight, to\r\nyour cool, temperate, and unseduced capacity of logical deduction. Yes,\r\ngentlemen, I, a poor man, do battle against the hosts of the rich. I,\r\nthe friend of honest labor, struggle against the huge monopoly of\r\nhoarded wealth, hoarded by grinding the faces of our sterling but\r\ndestitute laboring men--alone, I strive against these banded\r\npowers--will you desert me in the strife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" cried Flan Sucker, Ben Inky, and six more of Fog's principal\r\nmen--\"Never, never!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I am content. Come weal, come woe, here is a heart that will\r\nnever--or rather, gentlemen, let me say in the words of the poet--(it\r\nnow became quite obvious that Theodore was beginning to be very\r\nseriously affected by the frequent refreshment which Flan Sucker had\r\nadministered during his speech,)\r\n\r\n  'Come one, come all, this rock shall fly\r\n  From his firm base as soon as I.'\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, all I have to say is this--We are about to part.--When\r\nyou go to your homes, and with hearts enraptured by all a father's and a\r\nhusband's failings--feelings--you take your seats beside the old family\r\nfiresides, and with the partners of your bosoms getting supper, and your\r\ninteresting progeny clustering on your knees,--in the midst of all these\r\nblessings pause to ask yourselves, what are they? Your hearts will\r\nanswer, they are _our Country_! How then, you will inquire, is that\r\ncountry to be preserved, as a rich inheritance to these cherubs?--who\r\nby this time have climbed as high as your waistcoat pockets, into which\r\nthey have, with the natural instinct of young New Lights, thrust their\r\nlittle fingers--the response will be ready--Go to the polls in\r\nOctober--go, determined to sustain the everlasting principles of the\r\nNew-Light Quodlibetarian Democracy--go, with a firm resolve to support\r\nno Mandarin, no Middling, but to sustain an unadulterated True\r\nGrit:--go, to vote for Theodore Fog, and your country shall be forever\r\ngreat, prosperous and happy.\"\r\n\r\nA wave of the hand and a bow showed that Theodore had uttered his last\r\nwords--upon which several rounds of applause, resembling the\r\nsimultaneous clapping of wings and crowing of an acre of cocks, more\r\nthan anything else I can imagine, shook the firmament, and, as the old\r\nsong has it, \"made the welkin roar.\" A party of Tumbledownians,\r\ninstigated by Cale Goodfellow--(a wag who follows sporting, and keeps a\r\nbank--I mean a faro bank--at Tumbledown, a most special friend of\r\nTheodore's)--rushed up to the platform, and, seizing the orator in their\r\narms, bore him off in triumph to the spring, where they fell to\r\ncelebrating their victory, in advance of the election, over a fresh\r\nsupply of spirits produced by Cale Goodfellow for the occasion. The\r\nresult was that Theodore was obliged to be taken home to Quodlibet in a\r\ncondition which Mr. Handy, who is President of the Temperance Society,\r\npronounced to be perfectly shocking.\r\n\r\nSome speaking took place after this by several volunteers: but from the\r\nagitated condition of the assemblage, and the prevalence of uproar,\r\nnothing worthy of notice transpired, and by sundown nearly all who could\r\nget away had retired.\r\n\r\nQuipes had been an attentive observer of the earlier scenes of the day,\r\nand as he had his drawing-book with him, we had reason to expect some\r\nspirited sketches of the crowd; but the poor fellow, being fatigued and\r\nthirsty, and of a singularly weak head, was overtaken by his drought,\r\nand was laid away in the afternoon in Abel Brawn's wagon, in which he\r\nwas brought to Quodlibet, Neal Hopper undertaking to ride his horse back\r\nto the Borough.\r\n\r\nThe result of this day's proceedings was unfavorable to the regular\r\nnomination, and highly auspicious to Theodore Fog. It was very evident\r\nthat The Split was going to do us a great deal of harm, and this gave\r\nmuch uneasiness to the club. The Whigs seemed to consider it a good\r\nomen, and old Mr. Grant and his party left the field in high spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n  THE DIVISION OF THE PARTY BECOMES MORE DISTINCT--ADMIRABLE\r\n     ADDRESS OF ELIPHALET FOX AT THIS JUNCTURE--RESULT OF THE\r\n     ELECTION--REJOICINGS OF THE TRUE GRITS--JESSE FERRET'S\r\n     DIFFICULTIES--IS TAKEN TO TASK BY HIS DAME--CANDID AVOWAL\r\n     OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS--THEODORE FOG'S EXPOSITION OF TRUE\r\n     GRIT PRINCIPLES--HIS GOOD-NATURED ENCOURAGEMENT OF JESSE\r\n     FERRET--DABBS'S TREAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proceedings at the Sycamore Spring furnished melancholy evidence of\r\nthe serious character of the split which had taken place in our ranks.\r\nThis was a source of anxious and painful reflection to the New Lights.\r\nBut the assiduity with which we endeavored to heal this dissension only\r\nmade matters worse. The Whole Team, which, although not within the\r\ncounty, claimed to take a deep interest in this election, on the score\r\nof being within our congressional district, noticed our divisions with\r\nmuch self-gratulation, and made the best of them, by attacking Agamemnon\r\nFlag as \"the creature\" (to use its own unscrupulous language) of the\r\nHon. Middleton Flam; while, at the same time, it opened the flood-gates\r\nof its abuse upon Theodore Fog, as a man of \"bad habits, loose manners,\r\nand objectionable morals.\" The Bickerbray Scrutinizer was devoted to\r\nFlag and the regular ticket, and therefore defended Agamemnon against\r\nThe Whole Team, and let fly several arrows against Theodore Fog; thus\r\nunhappily fomenting the differences among our friends.\r\n\r\nThe course pursued by Eliphalet Fox, at this difficult juncture, was one\r\ncalculated to raise him in the esteem of every true Quod, and to place\r\nhim on a pinnacle among editors. He took none of those middle grounds\r\nwhich scarcely ever fail to bring a politician into contempt with both\r\nparties--but, with a boldness entirely peculiar to himself, and in the\r\nhighest degree illustrative of the New-Light theory, stoutly advocated\r\neach of our candidates, as the course of the canvass seemed to encourage\r\ntheir respective chances of success. Thus, when Theodore Fog first\r\nannounced himself as the independent candidate, and when every one\r\nappeared to regard this step as an act of presumption which could not\r\nbut result in defeat, Eliphalet put forth the following paragraph:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Mister_ Theodore Fog, of this Borough, an old practitioner at\r\n     _more than one bar_, having waked up one morning with the idea that\r\n     he was born to fill the measure of his country's glory, as well as\r\n     he fills that of his own every night, has conceived the sublime\r\n     project of running on an independent ticket, in the approaching\r\n     election. We would whisper in our friend The.'s ear, that he has\r\n     barked up the wrong tree. Independence is not a word to be found in\r\n     the New-Light dictionary. The voters of this county can never be\r\n     seduced from the support of the regular nomination; especially when\r\n     it is headed by such a man as Agamemnon Flag, whose eloquence,\r\n     accomplishments, and remarkable Democratic simplicity of manners,\r\n     as well as his perfect surrender of himself to the cause of his\r\n     Party, give him the highest claim to the consideration of every\r\n     right-minded and unadulterated Quod. Verb. sap. sat.\"\r\n\r\nNow, after the meeting of the Sycamore Spring, a new view of matters\r\nbroke upon Eliphalet's vision. He was certainly taken by surprise at the\r\ndemonstration which that meeting afforded of Theodore's strength with\r\nthe voters; and in the account of that event, which appeared in The\r\nWhole Hog on the succeeding Saturday, one scarcely knows whether most to\r\ncommend the sincerity of the writer, or the justness of the tribute paid\r\nto the masterly effort of Mr. Fog. Speaking of that effort, the editor\r\nemploys this language:--\r\n\r\n     \"In regard to our esteemed fellow-townsman, Theodore Fog,\r\n     the public expectation was more than realized. This unstudied\r\n     orator, with all the freshness impressed upon his mind by\r\n     the mint of nature herself, contemning the aid of tinsel\r\n     show, and presenting himself in the homely habiliments of\r\n     an unvarnished, and, as our adversaries scoffingly add,\r\n     of an unwashed New Light, poured forth a resistless flood\r\n     of native oratory, remarkable for that massive vigor of\r\n     thought, and that felicity of expression, which are the\r\n     rare endowments only of genius, trained _among_ the people,\r\n     and whose soul is _with_ the people. He descanted upon the\r\n     brilliant career of our never-sufficiently-to-be-flattered\r\n     administration, with an effect that thrilled in the pulse,\r\n     glowed in the countenance, and broke forth in the\r\n     reiterated shouts of every warm-hearted, straight-out,\r\n     lead-following, unagainst-the-wishes-or-commands-of-the\r\n     luminaries-of-the-party-rebelling New-Light Democrat on the\r\n     ground. We are happy to add our decided conviction that the\r\n     election of this staunch champion of the _real_ New Lights is\r\n     placed beyond a doubt.\"\r\n\r\nThe intrepidity of this paragraph will strike every one who reflects\r\nthat the canvass, at the time this appeared, was far from being brought\r\nto a close; and that the result, whatever Eliphalet might have thought\r\nof it, was deemed exceedingly doubtful. Indeed, we had subsequently a\r\nproof given to us, in The Whole Hog itself, that very serious opinions\r\nbegan to prevail against the possibility of Mr. Fog's carrying the day,\r\nin opposition to Flag.\r\n\r\nThe New-Light Club, with some few and unimportant exceptions, had\r\ndetermined, as they thought themselves in duty bound, to sustain the\r\nregular ticket, and for this purpose, when matters were running\r\nvery strong for Fog, and when, indeed, they began to entertain a\r\nwell-grounded fear that Andy Grant might slip in by the aid of these\r\ndivisions, resolved upon having a night procession in the Borough. This\r\nexpedient we have always resorted to with the happiest effects whenever\r\nwe have found the hopes of the New Lights beginning to ebb; it serves to\r\nanimate our friends, by throwing, as it were, a glare over their minds,\r\nand to render them more docile to the word of command from those who\r\ntake upon themselves the labor of judging for the multitude. We now had\r\nrecourse to this device with a very flattering, though as it turned out\r\nin the end, a deceptive manifestation of its influence upon the\r\nelection. The procession was made; paper lanterns in abundance, bearing\r\na variety of inscriptions of the most encouraging exhortation to the\r\nfriends of Flag and the Ticket, were procured for the occasion. Every\r\nlantern and every banner had written upon it FLAM, in the hope thus to\r\nidentify the ticket with our distinguished representative in Congress,\r\nand bring in the aid of his great name to our cause. Mottoes, having\r\nreference to \"the Old Hero of the Hermitage,\" were also profusely used,\r\nand even the Hickory Tree was reared aloft in the procession, covered\r\nwith small cup lamps in imitation of its fruit. Every one in Quodlibet\r\nsupposed that this stroke of the procession settled the matter. It\r\nundoubtedly converted the Borough and brought it into the utmost harmony\r\non our side. But the Tumbledownians, among whom Fog's great strength was\r\nfound, were not there; and from Bickerbray the delegation was not as\r\nlarge as it ought to have been. Still, the evidence of popular support\r\nto the ticket was deemed conclusive; so much so, that Eliphalet Fox's\r\nnext editorial referred to it as \"indicative of the stern resolve of the\r\nNew Lights, once and forever, to crush the insubordinate and rebellious\r\ntemper with which certain factious and discontented pretenders to the\r\nname of Democrats had endeavored to sow discord in the ranks of the\r\nfaithful, by setting up the absurd doctrine of independent opinion--a\r\ndoctrine so fatal to the New-Light Democracy wherever it has been\r\nallowed. Agamemnon Flag,\" the editor proceeded to remark, \"was not a man\r\nto be put down by the frothy, ginger-pop eloquence engendered in the hot\r\natmosphere of cock-tail and julep manufactories. Mr. Fog may now\r\nperceive that his secret perambulations to spread dissension in the\r\nNew-Light ranks, and his hypocritical boast of Independence will be\r\nscowled upon by every honest eye and spurned by every honest tongue\r\nwhich are to be found among the high-minded New-Light yeomanry of\r\nQuodlibet, Bickerbray, Tumbledown, and the adjacent parts.\"\r\n\r\nThe election soon after this took place, when, greatly to the\r\nastonishment of our club, and in fact of the whole party, the result was\r\nannounced to be as set forth in this table:--\r\n\r\n    _Quods._                        _Whig._\r\n  Theodore Fog,      1191.      Andrew Grant, 1039.\r\n  Abram Schoolcraft, 1084.\r\n  Curtius Short,     1063.\r\n  Agamemnon Flag,     758.\r\n\r\nThus it appeared that Theodore Fog far outran the rest of the ticket,\r\nand that Agamemnon Flag fell considerably below the Whig vote.\r\n\r\nEliphalet Fox, greatly delighted at the triumph of this election, lost\r\nno time in publishing a handbill announcing the issue. It was headed\r\n\r\n     \"GLORIOUS VICTORY! QUODLIBET ERECT!\"\r\n\r\nand proceeded to descant on the event in this wise:--\r\n\r\n     \"We have never for a moment permitted ourselves to doubt that our\r\n     estimable fellow-townsman Theodore Fog, one of the purest, most\r\n     disinterested and ablest Democrats of the glorious New-Light\r\n     Quodlibetarian School, would lead the polls; and, indeed, we took\r\n     occasion to insinuate as much after his celebrated speech at the\r\n     Sycamore Spring, which it was our good fortune to hear, and which,\r\n     as an exposition of sound New-Light principles, gave us such\r\n     unmixed delight. We cannot but feel regret that Mr. Flag's friends\r\n     should have so inconsiderately consented to place his name on the\r\n     ticket, before they had ascertained Mr. Fog's views in regard to\r\n     the election. An understanding upon this subject would have saved\r\n     them the mortification of presenting a name which, from the first,\r\n     we felt a presentiment was destined to incur defeat; and it would\r\n     have spared Mr. Flag the pain he must suffer in the present event.\r\n     The youth of this gentleman, his want of acquaintance with the\r\n     people, arising, doubtless, from the imperfection of his vision,\r\n     and his unfortunate espousal of the Iron Railing Compromise, very\r\n     obviously stood in the way of his success. A day will, however,\r\n     come around when, in our judgment, the people will do justice to\r\n     his pretension, which we undertake to say is considerable.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these extracts, the reader is already prepared to exclaim with me,\r\nOh, excellent Eliphalet Fox--mirror of editors--pillar of the New-Light\r\nfaith! What exquisite address, what consummate skill hast thou not\r\nevinced in these editorial effusions! Methinks I see Eliphalet, a\r\ntide-waiter on events, watching the ebb and flow of popular opinion;\r\never ready, at a moment's warning, to launch his little boat of\r\neditorship on the biggest wave, and upon that wave to ride secure beyond\r\nthe breakers, out upon the glassy ocean of politics and then, after\r\ntaking an observation of the wind, to trim his sail with such nautical\r\nforecast as shall make him sure to be borne along with the breeze toward\r\nwhatever haven it shall please the higher powers to direct him;\r\nsagaciously counting in such haven to find the richest return on his\r\nlittle stock of ventures. I see his meager, attenuated, diminutive\r\nperson, elevated on a footstool six inches above the floor, behind a\r\nhigh but somewhat rickety desk, in the northwest corner of his\r\nlumber-filled office, where scissor-clipped gazettes are strewed, elbow\r\ndeep, over an old walnut table, and where three dingy caricatures of\r\nHarry Clay, Nic Biddle, and John C. Calhoun, are tacked against his\r\nsmoky walls; there I see him quiet, but at work, with pen in hand, ever\r\nand anon darting his cat-like eye at the door, upon each new-comer who\r\ncomes to tell the news of the canvass. I hear his husky, dry, and\r\nquerulous voice, tisicky and quick, asking, how goes it in Bickerbray?\r\nWhat from Tumbledown? and as he receives his answer _pro_ or _con._, Fog\r\nor Flag, he turns to his half-scribbled sheet to remould his paragraph,\r\nwith the dexterity of an old and practiced Quod, in such phrase as shall\r\nassuredly earn him the good-will of the winner. Rare Eliphalet!\r\nAdmirable Fox! Incomparable servant of an incomparable master!\r\n\r\nIt is with a sad and melancholy sincerity I record the fact, that this\r\nelection left behind it much heart-burning in Quodlibet. The New-Light\r\nDemocracy were now broken into three parts, the Mandarins, the\r\nMiddlings, and the True Grits; and Theodore Fog, in command of the True\r\nGrits, had evidently got the upper hand. The defeat of Agamemnon Flag\r\nwas a severe blow to our distinguished representative, the Hon.\r\nMiddleton Flam, and no less galling to Nicodemus Handy; for these three\r\nworthy gentlemen were undoubtedly at the head of the Mandarins, and\r\ntheir overthrow on the present occasion led to unpleasant consequences\r\nwhich I shall be called upon to notice hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe first unhappy fruit of this election was of a domestic nature, and\r\nwrought very seriously against the peace of our friend Jesse Ferret.\r\n\r\nFor three days and nights after the publication of the polls, all\r\nQuodlibet was alive with the rejoicings of the True Grits at the success\r\nof Theodore Fog. The bar-room of The Hero was full all day with these\r\nenergetic friends of the prosperous candidate; and it is worthy of\r\nremark that their number was vastly greater than was shown by the ballot\r\nbox, many more individuals claiming the honor of having voted for him\r\nthan the return of the polls would authorize us to believe; all night\r\nlong bonfires blazed, drums and fifes disturbed the repose of the\r\nBorough, and processions, not remarkable for their decorum, marched from\r\nhouse to house with Theodore mounted in a chair, borne on the shoulders\r\nof sturdy True Grits. A hundred torches in the hands of thirty men and\r\nseventy boys, flared on the signs and flickered on the walls of\r\nQuodlibet, and fifty negroes, great and small, ragged and patched,\r\nhatless and hatted, slip-shod and barefoot, leaped, danced, limped, and\r\nhobbled in wide-spread concourse around black Isaac the Kent bugle\r\nplayer, and yellow Josh the clarionet man, who struck in with the drum\r\nand fife to the tune of Jim Crow, about the center of the column. Flan\r\nSucker was installed grand marshal of this procession, and was called\r\nKING OF THE TRUE GRITS; while Ben Inky, Sim Travers, Jeff Drinker, and\r\nMore M'Nulty, served along the flanks as his lieutenants; the whole\r\narray huzzaing at every corner, and stopping to refresh every time they\r\ncame into the neighborhood of Peter Ounce's, Jesse Ferret's, or the\r\nsmaller ordinaries which the rapid growth of Quodlibet had supplied in\r\nvarious quarters to relieve the drought of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThis state of things, as I have said, continued for three days after\r\nthe election. At the end of that period, Jesse Ferret, somewhere about\r\nnoon, was in his bar casting up his accounts. He wore a serious,\r\ndisturbed countenance--not because his accounts showed a bad face; for\r\nso far from that, the late jubilee had very considerably increased his\r\ncapital in trade, but because his rest had been broken--and Jesse never\r\ncould bear to lose his sleep. While he was engaged in summing up these\r\nrecent gains, his worthy spouse entered the bar and quietly seated\r\nherself in a chair behind him. The expression of her face showed that\r\nher thoughts were occupied with matter of interesting import: a slight\r\nfrown sat upon her brow, her lips were partially compressed, and her fat\r\narms made an attempt to cross each other on her bosom. The chair was too\r\nsmall for her; and, from her peculiar configuration, one looking at her\r\nin a full front view would not be likely to conjecture she was seated,\r\nbut rather that she was a short and dumpy woman, and leaned against some\r\nprop for rest--the line from her chin to her toe being that of the face\r\nof a pyramid. Her posture denoted an assumed patience. So quietly had\r\nshe entered the inclosure of the bar, that Jesse was altogether ignorant\r\nof her presence, and therefore continued at his occupation. It was not\r\nlong, however, before his attention was awakened to the interesting fact\r\nthat his wife was behind him, by the salutation, conveyed in a rather\r\ndeep-toned voice, \"Jesse Ferret, how long are you agoing to be poking\r\nover them accounts?\"\r\n\r\nJesse turned short round, in some surprise at the sound of these\r\nwell-known accents so near him, and, surveying the dame for an instant,\r\nreplied--\r\n\r\n\"Bless me, Polly! how came you here? You go about like one of them\r\nchurch-yard vaporations that melts in thin air and frightens children in\r\nthe dead of night. What did you want with me, my love?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to know,\" said Mrs. Ferret, \"who's master of this house--you or\r\nme? Ef I'm the master, say so--but ef you're the master, then act as\r\nsich. It ain't no longer to be endured, this shilly-shally, visy-versy\r\npoliticks of yourn. Here you are casting up of the accounts this blessed\r\nday, and please Heaven, if there's one cent got into the till in the\r\nthree days that have gone by, the last person in the world to thank for\r\nit is yourself, Jesse Ferret. Theodore Fog's _in_--got in by a vote that\r\none might say's almost magnanimous, and he's got all the thirstiest men\r\nin this Borough under his thumb--and he's been pouring 'em in here in\r\nshoals, which he wouldn't have done, one man of 'em, ef it hadn't a been\r\nfor my principles, which goes the whole hog--and you so contrairy,\r\nconstantly a giving out your no sides--it's raly abominable! and time\r\nyou should change, Jesse Ferret, it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, my dear, don't you see the good of it?\" said Mr. Ferret, in a\r\nmild, good-natured tone of expostulation. \"The very best thing we can do\r\nis for you to go on as you are doing, and me to go on as I am. Here's\r\ncome up a great split in the party; and presently, as sure as you are\r\nborn, they'll be having their separate houses and making party questions\r\nout of it: then, my dear, you know Theodore Fog and his people counts\r\nyou as a sort of sun-dial to their side, and goes almost by your\r\npinting. And then the others, you know, can't have nothing to find fault\r\nagainst me upon account of my sentiments: so, in this way we shall get\r\nthe custom of the thorough-stitchers, the half-and-halfs, the\r\npromiscuous, and of every kind of stripe that's going. Can't you see\r\ninto it, Mrs. Ferret?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I cannot see into it,\" replied the landlady. \"In the first place,\r\nthem Mandarins, as The. Fog says, is not worth the looking after in our\r\nline--they drink nothing but Champagne and Madeery, and ef they do\r\nsometimes send down to our bar for ourn, they are sure to turn up their\r\nnoses at it, and say it's sour. Didn't Nicodemus Handy tell me to my\r\nface that my Anchor Brand, which you've got on the top shelf, and\r\nwhich cost you six dollars a basket at auction, was nothing but\r\nturnip-juice?--and did you ever know Middleton Flam to call for as much\r\nas a thimbleful of your liquors, with all his preachings and parleyings\r\nin this house? No, you did not: and it's your duty to cast off your\r\nbucket o' both sides, and go in for The. with the True Grits, as he\r\ncalls them; and true enough they are in the drinking line!--that, nobody\r\nwho knows them, will deny. I'm tired, Jesse Ferret, and fretted down to\r\nthe very bone, at being put upon in this here way, having to keep up the\r\npoliticks of this house, which I don't think you haint no right to do, I\r\ndon't. I'm been a talking to you about this tell I'm tired, and I wonder\r\nyou can be so obstinate, considering I take it so much to heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Polly,\" interposed our landlord with an affectionate\r\nremonstrance, intended to soothe Mrs. Ferret's feelings, \"many's the\r\nstruggle I've had on this here very topic with my own conscience; I may\r\nsay I have wrestled for it at the very bottom of my nature. But the case\r\nis this, and I'll explain it to you once for all. I've got a sentiment\r\nat the core of my heart, which is a secret in regard of these here\r\npoliticks. I wish to go right--you know I do--but if I only knowed what\r\nsentiments _to_ take up:--there's the mystery. If I knowed _that_, I\r\nshould feel easy; but I never could keep any principles, upon account of\r\nthe changes. Before a plain, simple man can cleverly tell where he is,\r\neverything has whisked away in the contrairy direction. One year we are\r\n'all tariff,' and the next, 'down with it as an abomination.' Here we go\r\n'for canals and railroads!'--a crack of the whip, and there we are all\r\nt'other side. 'No electioneering of officers!' cries out the captain of\r\nthe squad. 'Turn that fellow out, he don't work for the party!' cries\r\nthe very same captain in the very next breath. 'Retrenchment and\r\nreform!' says every big fellow there at Washington; and the same words\r\nare bawled all the way down among us, even to Theodore Fog;--'Damn the\r\nexpense!' (the Lord forgive me for using such words,) says the very same\r\nfellows in the same breath, 'stick on a million here and a million\r\nthere--the more the merrier!' And so we go. Here, t'other day, this here\r\nSub-Treasury was monarchy and revolution to boot, and treason outright;\r\nand now, what it _is_, every man's afeard to say--some's for, some's\r\nagainst--some's both, and all's in a state of amalgamation, perplexity,\r\nand caterwauling unaccountable. What between specy circlars,\r\nanti-masons, pocketing of bills, (Lord knows what that means!) vetoes,\r\ndistribution, fortifications, abolition, running down Indians, and\r\nrunning up accounts, politics has got into a jumble that a Philadelphy\r\nlawyer couldn't steer through them. A poor publican has a straining time\r\nof it, Polly. He can't get right if he tries--and if he does blunder\r\nupon it, he can't _stay_ right six months, let him do his best--morally\r\nimpossible! That's where it's a matter o' conscience with me; and my\r\nconclusion is, in such a mucilaginous state of affairs, a man who wants\r\nto accommodate the public must be either all sides or no sides; and,\r\ntherefore I say, my motto is, a publican should--leastways I speak in\r\nregard to these times--have no sides. And there's the whole matter laid\r\nout to you, Polly, my wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"All sides, any day, before No sides!\" replied Mrs. Ferret. \"As Susan\r\nBarndollar says, stick to your colors and they'll carry you to sides a\r\nplenty, I'll warrant you. Don't Theodore Fog tell us the Democracy's a\r\ntrying of experiments--and, Lord bless us! ef they haint carried you on\r\nsides enough, then you _are_ an unreasonable man. Principle isn't\r\nprinciple--it's following of your party:--you change when _it_ changes,\r\nwhereby you are always right. Now, these here True Grits is two to one\r\nto the Mandarins and Middlings both, and they devour, yes, ten times as\r\nmuch liquor. Ef you had an eye in your head, you'd come out a True\r\nGrit--it's a naiteral tavern-keeper's politics.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Spose, my dear,\" said Jesse, waxing warm, \"things takes a turn off\r\nhand. 'Spose these True Grits are upset--as I shouldn't wonder they\r\nwould be, as soon as Middleton Flam comes home from Congress, and winds\r\nup the people right again--as he has often done before--am I going to\r\nrun my head against a post by offending the whole New-Light Club, which\r\nmeets at our house, and make enemies by having sentiments of my own? You\r\ndon't know me, Polly Ferret.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, and ef things does take a turn?\" replied the wife, \"is there\r\nanythink new in that, in this Borough? Haint we had turns before?\r\nTheodore Fog will turn with 'em--that's his principle--that's my\r\nprinciple, and it ought, by rights, to be yourn. Doesn't the\r\nschoolmaster tell you to stick to the upper side? Doesn't our member,\r\nMiddleton Flam, tell you the same thing, and Nicodemus Handy, and\r\nLiphlet Fox? There's your own barkeeper, Nim Porter, that's asleep in\r\nyander winder, who's got more sense than you have; he knows what side\r\nhis bread's buttered--and even your own child, Susan Barndollar, though\r\nshe stuck out for the nomination, isn't such a ninny as to have no\r\nprinciples. We're Dimmycrats, and always counts with the majority; and\r\nthat's safe whichever way it goes; and, as I said before, no mortal man\r\ncan find out a better side than that for a tavern-keeper. But it's the\r\nWhigs your're a courting, Jesse Ferret--the Whigs, neither more nor\r\nless--and it's pitiful in you to be so sneaking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Polly, if you aint got no better language than that to use to me,\"\r\nexclaimed Ferret, under considerable excitement, \"I'd advise you to hold\r\nyour tongue.\"\r\n\r\n\"My tongue's my own, Mr. Ferret,\" replied the landlady, \"and I don't\r\nwant none of your advice what I'm to do with it. I have used it long\r\nenough to know how to keep it a running, and how to stop it, without\r\nbeing taught by you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got no right to listen to you, if I don't choose,\" retorted the\r\nlandlord. \"Women has their milking and churning to look after, and, to\r\nmy thinking, they'd best attend to that, instead of skreiking out\r\npolitics in public bar-rooms--that's my opinion, Mrs. Ferret.\"\r\n\r\n\"Women, indeed!--for _you_ to talk about women!--You're the\r\nlaughing-stock of all the petticoats of our Borough,\" said the wife, in\r\na high key of exacerbation. \"Mrs. Younghusband, and Mrs. Snuffers, and\r\nMrs. Doubleday makes you a continual banter, and it hurts my feelings as\r\nthe mother of your children, it does.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seize Mrs. Younghusband, and Mrs. Snuffers, and Mrs. Doubleday, all\r\nthree!\" exclaimed Ferret in a sort of demi-oath.\r\n\r\n\"What's that you said, Mr. Ferret?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said seize 'em! and I don't care the rinsings of that glass if you\r\ntell 'em so,--a set of mandrakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jesse Ferret, Jesse Ferret,--as a man who sets up to be an\r\nexample, what are you coming to!\" exclaimed the landlady, with uplifted\r\nhands. \"Ef your children could hear such profanity. I declare to\r\npatience, you'd try the quarters of the meekest mother in the universe.\"\r\n\r\nHow far this conjugal outflash might have gone in its natural course, it\r\nis impossible for me to say; although Nim Porter, who pretended to be\r\nasleep all the time, and who heard every word of it, and related it with\r\nmuch pleasantry to me, says he has often witnessed these breezes between\r\nthis worthy couple, and always found that they made up as soon as Mrs.\r\nFerret got out of breath--which, by-the-by, she being short-winded,\r\ngenerally occurred in about half an hour from the first rising of her\r\nanger; but, on the present occasion, it was happily interrupted by the\r\nentrance of Theodore Fog, Dabbs, the foreman in Eliphalet Fox's\r\nprinting-office, Flan Sucker, More M'Nulty, and Sim Travers, who all\r\nmarched directly up to the bar. I had entered upon the heels of this\r\nparty, and having taken up \"The Whole Hog\" for my perusal, in one corner\r\nof the room, was myself a witness to the scene that followed.\r\n\r\nNim Porter, who was seated in an elbow-chair, resting the back of his\r\nhead against a window-sill at the opposite end of the bar-room and\r\ncounterfeiting sleep, was now roused up to attend to the customers.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mrs. Ferret--paragon of landladies,\" said Fog, \"Pillar--yes,\r\nbolster of our cause--some drink! Dabbs owes a treat, and we have\r\nresolved that the libation shall be made under the eye of our own queen.\r\nDabbs, say what the mixture shall be; I'm not particular--my throat is a\r\nturnpike traveled by all imaginable potations. A mint julep, Dabbs?\r\ngentlemen! Flan, a julep? Yes? A julep, a julep all round. Agreed to,\r\nnem. con. Mrs. Ferret, five juleps; charge Dabbs--Dabbs's treat.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Ferret's anger against her spouse gradually faded under this\r\naccost; a slight glimpse of sunshine began to break over her visage as\r\nshe addressed herself to the task of preparing the required compounds,\r\nand Nim Porter busied himself in picking sprigs of mint from a large\r\nbouquet of that invaluable plant, which flourished in native verdure\r\nover the rim of a two quart tumbler, in which it seemed to grow as in a\r\nflower-pot.\r\n\r\nFerret had retreated from the bar toward the door which looked upon the\r\nstreet; and Theodore Fog, who, as the truth must be spoken, was at this\r\nhour very considerably advanced toward his customary zenith of\r\nexcitement, thrust his hands under the skirts of his striped gingham\r\ncoatee, and strutted with the air of a prime minister in a farce, around\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\"Nim,\" said he,\r\n\r\n  \"'Bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,\r\n  She strike upon the bell.'\r\n\r\nFerret--glorious turn out, Ferret. True Grits all alive. Pound that ice\r\nfine, Nim--no water, recollect. First-rate fellows, Ferret--go the\r\nwhole--real Quods--diamonds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hope you'll mend matters now, Mr. Fog, since you've got in,\" said\r\nFerret. \"I'm for giving every one a chance; wish you success.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you do, Ferret,\" replied Fog; \"and so you would have wished\r\nAg Flag success if he'd got in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or Andy Grant, either,\" said Mrs. Ferret; \"my husband's not partikler.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Ferret--you're right!\" interrupted Fog, \"always go with\r\nthe current--that's sound philosophy--that's my rule. Dabbs, isn't that\r\nmetaphysics? Flan, don't you call that the true theory of the balance of\r\npower? Gentlemen, I submit it to you all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Real True-Grit doctrine,\" said Flan; \"find out how the cat jumps--then\r\ngo ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fundamental, that,\" said Dabbs; \"principles change, measures vary,\r\nnames rise and fall, but majority is always majority.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo, Dabbs!\" ejaculated Theodore Fog; \"_Tempora mutantur et nos\r\nmutamur cum illis_--that's our True-Grit motto. The nominative case\r\nalways agrees with the verb; the people are the verb, we're the\r\nnominative case. That's logic, Mrs. Ferret. Nim, how have you made out\r\nin these illustrious 'three days?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Cursed sleepy,\" answered Nim Porter, who was now brewing the drink by\r\npouring it from one tumbler to another; \"haven't had three hours rest in\r\nthe whole three nights. No right to complain though--won four bets--had\r\ntwo to one against Andy Grant with Tompkinson--and even against Ag with\r\nthree of the New-Light Club. I knew d--d well how it was going, ever\r\nsince the meeting at the Sycamore Spring. Fog, you touched them fellows\r\nthat work on the Bickerbray and Meltpenny Road 'twixt wind and water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I?\" exclaimed Fog; \"I opine I did; unequivocally, I fancy I did.\r\nI venture to add, with all possible energy of asseveration, that I did\r\nthat thing, Nim. That's what I call walking into the understanding of\r\nthe independent, electoral constituent body; and the best of it is, we\r\ngot them their votes, you dog!\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't lose no votes that I could bring you,\" said Mrs. Ferret,\r\n\"although you didn't get Jesse's. But that wa'n't much loss--for Jesse's\r\nof little account anyhow, and hasn't the influence of a chicken in this\r\nBorough--as no man hasn't, whose afeard of his shadow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we don't want to hear no more about that,\" interrupted the\r\nlandlord. \"Mr. Fog knows it wasn't ill will to him--but only my\r\nprinciple, that publicans had best not take sides.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who has a right to object to that?\" exclaimed Fog. \"Give us your\r\nhand, Jesse--I'd do the same thing myself, if I were in your place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, ef you aint the forgivingest creature, Mr. Fog!\" said the\r\nlandlady.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Ferret, your health!--gentlemen, take your respective\r\nglasses--Dabbs, your health--Jesse--Flan--all of you--Success to the\r\nTrue Grits! Top off, boys.\"\r\n\r\nThey all drank.\r\n\r\nFog applied the tumbler to his lips; looked straight forward, with what\r\nmight be called a fixed stare upon vacancy, his eyes expressing the deep\r\nemotion of sensual pleasure which the icy compound inspired as it slowly\r\nflowed over his palate, and for a full minute employed himself without\r\npause in draining the contents of his glass--gradually and slowly\r\narching back his head until the last drop trickled from the bottom.\r\n\r\n\"Amazing seductive beverage, Mrs. Ferret!\" he said as he smacked his\r\nlips, and set the tumbler down upon the board. \"Fascinating potation! If\r\nI were not an example of consummate prudence, and the most circumspect\r\nbeing not yet gathered within the pale of the Temperance Society, my\r\nvirtue would have fallen a victim before this to that enticing cordial,\r\nMrs. Ferret. But I'm proof--I have been sorely tried, and have come out\r\nof the furnace, as you see me, superior to the temptations of this\r\nwicked world. Dabbs, poney up--we must go to the raffle, which begins in\r\nfive minutes at Rhody M'Caw's stable--that pacing roan, Nim--you'll be\r\nthere, of course:--in your line. Come, gentlemen--don't wipe your mouths\r\nwith your sleeves--let the odor exhale. As some poet somewhere says,\r\nspeaking of a mint julep,\r\n\r\n  'Sweet vale of Ovoca, how calm could I rest,--\r\n    If there's a drink upon earth\r\n      It is this--it is this.'\r\n\r\nNot the words exactly--but something in that run. Jesse, the Flower of\r\nQuodlibet--Mrs. Ferret, Queen of the Spear Mint--good-by. Nim, you\r\nrascal--after the raffle is over, expect to see me as dry as an oven.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Fog had delivered himself of this rhapsody--which, no doubt, has\r\nimpressed the reader with the conviction that this noontide glass had\r\ndone its work upon the brain of our new representative in the\r\nLegislature--the whole party made their exit; and Jesse Ferret, anxious\r\nto avoid another conference with his dame, professing a wish to witness\r\nthe raffle, followed in their footsteps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n  THIRD ERA--DIVISIONS IN QUODLIBET CONTINUE--FOMENTED BY\r\n     THE WOMEN--FOG RATHER DISAPPOINTS HIS FRIENDS BY HIS\r\n     COURSE IN THE LEGISLATURE--PROSTRATION OF BUSINESS IN THE\r\n     BOROUGH--TRACED TO THE MERCHANTS--MR.

For, truly, the history of Quodlibet will be found, when\r\nimpartially narrated, to yield a plentiful fruitage of ethical, moral\r\nand social instruction, as well as political--to which latter aspect are\r\nmy labors at this time confined.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with my plan, and being desirous to hasten forward to a\r\nmore modern epoch in these annals, I pass over the intervening space,\r\nand bring my reader almost a year in advance of the events narrated in\r\nthe last chapter.\r\n\r\nIt was now approaching the fifth year of the Removal:--the long session\r\nof Congress had closed in July, 1838. The Hon. Middleton Flam had once\r\nmore returned to his constituents, and temporarily mingled in the walks\r\nof private life. Greatly was his return desiderated at this epoch. We\r\nhad got all wrong--we lacked information--we wanted this great man's\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nThe split at this time--if I may use a metaphor--was green and wide;\r\nor, in plainer language, our dissensions ran high. If the men might be\r\nsaid to be at sixes and sevens, the women were twice as bad--they were\r\nat twelves and fourteens. Mrs. Ferret had become inveterate, and headed\r\na party of Feminine True Grits; Susan Barndollar, who had a temper of\r\nher own, of course became inveterate too, and, as Barndollar &\r\nHardbottle were accounted a rich firm, she headed, or strove to do so, a\r\nparty of Feminine Mandarins. Hester Hardbottle, under a similar impulse,\r\ntook command of the Female Middlings. Thus marshaled, the New-Light\r\nwomen manifested a very high degree of political corruscation, and kept\r\nthe Borough in perpetual hot water. Every tea-party was a scalding\r\nconcern, and it was lamentable to see what a foothold the serpent of\r\ndiscord had gained in our little Eden of Quodlibet.\r\n\r\nThe men were not so ferocious; in part because they had their business\r\nto look after; but chiefly, because the stronger, when they failed in\r\nargument, could drub the weaker--and that drubbing system is a great\r\nmoderator of political opinions. The women, having neither of these\r\nmotives to keep quiet, took the bits in their mouths and ran off as fast\r\nas, and whenever, they chose.\r\n\r\nTheodore Fog's conduct in the Legislature, during the past winter, had\r\nin some degree rather weakened the cause of his friends. He had\r\ndisappointed them--although they were unwilling publicly to allow as\r\nmuch--on two points: First, because he had not got them all provided\r\nwith offices, as he had, it appeared, secretly promised; but, on the\r\ncontrary, came home without having accomplished that desirable object\r\nfor a single individual of the party; and, secondly, because he had been\r\nexceedingly irregular in his habits during the whole session, and had\r\nconsequently made but four speeches, of three hours each, during the\r\nwinter, when it was confidently expected that he would have made at\r\nleast thirty-four, and have completely silenced the opposition. The\r\nirregularity of his habits they could forgive; but the matter of the\r\noffices sunk deep in their hearts--they began to suspect his Democracy.\r\n\r\nA change had also taken place in the business affairs of Quodlibet. All\r\nimprovements had ceased:--many persons were out of employment; industry\r\nwas declining; trade was at a low ebb; the mechanics were grumbling, and\r\nfour mercantile houses had failed. Immediately after the suspension\r\nNicodemus Handy had issued a great amount of small notes. Dr. Thomas G.\r\nWinkelman, actuated by patriotic emotions, also issued a batch\r\npayable in soda-water, soap, or physic. Zachary Younghusband, the\r\ntinplate-worker and postmaster, reflecting on the crisis, and being\r\ndetermined to contribute his mite toward the regulation of the currency,\r\nfollowed the example of Dr. Winkelman, and put out a ream, redeemable in\r\nCopperplate Bank notes when presented to the amount of five dollars at\r\nhis tinplate shop. Sim Travers, who had a drinking shed at the lower end\r\nof the canal basin, with equal public spirit, uttered his paper in fips,\r\n\"Good for a Drink.\" Many others imitated these precedents, whereby it\r\nfell out that no part of the Union was better supplied with a currency\r\nthan Quodlibet.\r\n\r\nStill the Borough languished and pined under a gradual decay of its\r\nprosperity; and it was long before our wise men could ascertain the real\r\nsource of this decline. The cause was at last discovered. We are\r\nindebted for its development to the astuteness of our distinguished\r\nrepresentative. There were eight of the principal mercantile houses of\r\nthe Borough which had been established by Whigs: in fact, throwing out\r\nBarndollar & Hardbottle, all the merchants of Quodlibet might be said to\r\nbe opposed to the administration. It was very apparent, after the Hon.\r\nMiddleton Flam drew the attention of the club to this fact, that these\r\nhouses had combined to produce an utter prostration of business, solely\r\nfor political effect, and that the malevolence of four of the most\r\nthriving among them had gone so far as even to render themselves\r\nbankrupt, and to break up, for no earthly purpose but that of making the\r\nadministration unpopular. \"This is a specimen of the gratitude,\" said\r\nMr. Flam, speaking with great emotion upon the subject, \"this is the\r\ngratitude of these commercial vultures--(he always called them\r\ncommercial vultures after the Suspension, and when speaking to the\r\npeople)--for all the manifold favors and bounties which, for five years\r\npast, the government has been so assiduously heaping upon their heads.\r\nThis is their acknowledgment of the extraordinary kindness shown them by\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury when he directed our bank to lend these\r\nvipers the public money! Biddle and the Barings are at the bottom of\r\nthis conspiracy; and the merchants of the United States, yes, and the\r\nmanufacturers and all the moneyed men, would gladly beggar themselves\r\nand their families rather than allow us to regulate their currency and\r\nmake them the happiest people on earth. What unparalleled perfidy!\"\r\n\r\nAfter this, the New Lights of course became indignant against the\r\nmerchants, and held them up, as they deserved, to public execration, as\r\nthe authors of all our misfortunes. From Quodlibet, this sentiment\r\nbecame general among the New-Light Democrats everywhere. Mr. Van Buren\r\ncaught the idea; the Globe expatiated upon it; the Stump rang with it;\r\nand it soon took its place as one of the cardinal maxims in the\r\nNew-Light creed. Such is the supremacy of one commanding intellect!\r\n\r\nNever was there a topic equal to this in the elections. \"The\r\nmerchants,\" Theodore Fog very pertinently remarked, \"are a first-rate\r\nsubject for a stump speech: they are a monstrous _little_ knot of\r\nfellows, anyhow--and, comparatively speaking, of no sort of account, in\r\nthe way of voting. Having the handling of a good deal of cash, and\r\nplenty to do in the way of giving and taking of promissory notes, you\r\ncan slap upon them the argument of The Money Power with tremendous\r\neffect: you can tickle them with the whip of Aristocracy in perfection;\r\nand you can run 'em down with the text of the money-changers in the\r\nTemple, and all that sort of thing, to a nicety. Besides, there are so\r\nfew of them that either _can_ make a speech before the people, or, if\r\nthey can, will take the trouble to follow a man about for that purpose,\r\nthat you are not likely to be pestered with their replies. Capital\r\nanimals for _an opposition_, they take a lathering so quiet! Then, sir,\r\nfor every _one_ merchant you lay upon his back, you gain _five_ True\r\nGrits to your side. I've studied that out. Our people, I mean the New\r\nLights, can be made to hate a merchant like snakes--because if he does\r\nget on well with his business, and makes a little fortune, we can call\r\nhim a Rag Baron, a Ruffle Shirt, a Scrub Aristocrat,--and that's equal\r\nto sending him to the deserts of Arabia: and if he fails, as the greater\r\npart of the poor devils do, we can get up a still worse cry against him\r\nfor turning the humble and honest laborer out of employment, grinding\r\nthe faces of the poor, depriving the widow and the orphan of their\r\nbread, and coining the sweat of the Bone and Sinew's brow to feed\r\nUsurers, Brokers, and Shavers. And, by-the-by, these arguments are quite\r\ngood against manufacturers and Whig master-mechanics. But a merchant,\r\nsir, can't hold up his head one moment before them. Every which way,\r\nsir, he's a prime scape-goat. Then, sir, when we want to make an\r\nEXPERIMENT,--why, of course, we go to the merchants. Here's all this\r\n_currency_ business, especially the tail of it, the Sub-Treasury--fine\r\nthing to stir up the people with--sounds well in theory, though a little\r\nmischievous in practice. Well, sir, we test it on the merchants: _we_\r\nget the popularity, _they_ get the damage. The approved philosophical\r\nmode to try a dangerous experiment, is to attempt it on a cat:--sir,\r\n_The Merchants are our cats_.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Flam, seeing the state of our divisions, took a great deal of\r\ntrouble to restore harmony into our ranks, and certainly did much to\r\noverawe the True Grits, who, now fancying themselves in the ascendent,\r\nbecame very dictatorial. Eliphalet Fox, although he took every occasion\r\nto speak in his paper greatly in commendation of Mr. Flam, was,\r\nnevertheless, an active upholder of the True-Grit division. \"Our worthy\r\nrepresentative,\" he said, \"was happily stationed above the influence of\r\nthese little _family quarrels_; and it was undoubtedly a subject of\r\ncongratulation with that distinguished gentleman, that every section of\r\nthe great Democratic household of Quodlibet could cordially unite the\r\ntestimonials of their confidence in his talents, his patriotism, and his\r\nfidelity to the interests of his constituents.\"\r\n\r\nThis paragraph was considered a master-stroke of New-Light Democracy in\r\nEliphalet, because its tendency was to keep him and his paper on good\r\nterms with all parties supporting the administration, while it left him\r\nfree to pursue the paramount objects which the True Grits steadily kept\r\nin view.\r\n\r\nThese objects were the attainment of all the lucrative offices in our\r\ndistrict,--a striking exemplification of which now occurred in the\r\ncelebrated Tigertail affair. That affair my duty as a chronicler\r\nrequires me to notice.\r\n\r\nA secret meeting of the True Grits had been lately held in the Borough.\r\nThe subject in discussion was a weighty one. It was reported to this\r\nconclave that Ferox Tigertail, the marshal of this district, who resided\r\nand kept his office in Bickerbray, had in his employment two individuals\r\nof suspicious principles. The first was Washington Cutbush, a clerk, who\r\nhad been overheard to say, at the Sycamore Spring, in a confidential\r\nconversation with his brother-in-law, Lemuel Garret, that he began to\r\nthink Tom Benton's gold currency a HUMBUG! The second was Corney Dust,\r\nthe porter and firemaker of the office, who, there was reason to\r\nbelieve, had voted at the last election for Agamemnon Flag. Upon these\r\nfacts being vouched to the meeting by Magnus Morehead, the True Grit\r\nshoemaker in the Borough, and Sandy Buttercrop, the express-rider,\r\nmessage-carrier, baggage-porter, and follower of sundry other visible\r\nmeans of livelihood, it was resolved that a committee of three, to\r\nconsist of Eliphalet Fox, Dr. Winkelman, and Nim Porter, should wait\r\nupon Mr. Tigertail, communicate to him the full extent of the charge,\r\nand require him, in the name of The Exclusive, New-Light, True-Grit\r\nDemocrats of Quodlibet, forthwith to dismiss Washington Cutbush from his\r\noffice, and substitute Magnus Morehead in his place; and also to\r\nsupersede Corney Dust by the appointment of Sandy Buttercrop.\r\n\r\nThe committee, in pursuance of these instructions, visited the marshal,\r\nand explained the object of their mission in respectful but firm\r\nlanguage. Tigertail, being a choleric man, and an old Federalist to\r\nboot,--who had been converted to the New-Light faith about eight years\r\nago, at the date of the renewal of his commission,--heard the committee\r\nwith exemplary composure; and then setting his eyes, with a fixed glare,\r\nupon Eliphalet Fox, he waited about ten seconds--at the end of which\r\nbrief period of deliberation, he kicked the said Eliphalet clean out of\r\nhis office:--and this being done to his entire satisfaction, he rather\r\ntestily invited Dr. Winkelman and Nim Porter to follow their chairman.\r\nIt is due to these two gentlemen to say, that like good committee men,\r\nthey did so,--even anticipating the marshal's invitation to the adoption\r\nof that course of conduct.\r\n\r\nThis incident being faithfully reported by the committee to the meeting\r\nof True Grits, convened for the express purpose of learning the result,\r\nit was unanimously resolved,--First, that Tigertail's demeanor was\r\nmysterious, equivocal, and unexpected; secondly, that it was unpolite to\r\nEliphalet Fox; and, thirdly, that it was against the principles and\r\nusages known to the New-Light Democracy. Another resolution was adopted\r\nto lay the whole matter before the President of the United States, and\r\nto instruct him, as the Representative of the People, to dismiss Marshal\r\nTigertail, without delay, from his post; and confer it upon the injured\r\nEliphalet Fox, whose kicking entitled him to the deepest sympathy of the\r\nparty, and gave him, according to a well-established maxim of the New\r\nLights, a right to immediate preferment.\r\n\r\nThese resolutions imparted great satisfaction to the meeting, and no\r\ndoubt was entertained that the President would act upon the subject with\r\nthat promptitude which distinguishes his character. Marshal Tigertail\r\nwas looked upon as a doomed man, and no better than a Whig; and indeed\r\nhe was already considered as having joined that party. Dr. Thomas G.\r\nWinkelman, Nim Porter, and Dabbs, the compositor, were intrusted with\r\nthis embassy of instruction to the President;--Eliphalet Fox being left\r\nout of the deputation from obvious considerations of delicacy--a\r\nsentiment which it must be allowed has ever characterized the\r\nproceedings of the True Grits on all occasions, and which many of the\r\nmost observant and sagacious of that sect have asserted has been the\r\nprincipal cause of the failure of their schemes.\r\n\r\nThe new deputation lost no time in setting forth upon the execution of\r\ntheir duty. They were attended to the stage coach by a large number of\r\nTrue Grits, who, to use the language of Theodore Fog, \"signalized their\r\ndeparture with indignant pomp.\" Great expectations were indulged on this\r\nappeal, or rather this mandate to the President. Day after day passed by\r\nwithout bringing news from the mission:--the Globe was taken from each\r\nmail with increased avidity, in the hope of seeing some official\r\nannouncement of the removal of Tigertail. A provoking silence on that\r\npoint reigned throughout its columns. Ten days rolled on without a\r\nletter from the committee:--a fortnight wore away, and yet none had\r\nreturned. A traveler at last reported that he had seen Nim Porter at the\r\nWhite Sulphur Springs. It was ascertained that Dr. Winkelman was\r\nin the City of New York purchasing drugs for his shop; and upon\r\ninvestigation it was discovered that Dabbs had been at his work in the\r\nprinting-office, unknown to the Borough, for more than a week. By a\r\nsingular coincidence of feeling among the True Grits, all curiosity as\r\nto the fate of the mission suddenly subsided. The subject was treated\r\nwith indifference; and in the course of a few days, after both Dr.\r\nWinkelman and Nim Porter had returned home, when the Thorough Blue Whole\r\nTeam put forth a paragraph inquiring after the Tigertail Embassy, the\r\nWhole Hog came out with a petulant and snappish reply, affirming that\r\nthe report of such a mission was a mere Whig lie, coined with a view to\r\npolitical effect, and uttered in the Whole Team simply because \"that\r\nmendacious and filthy sheet delighted to revel in falsehood, and had\r\nnever been known to stumble upon the truth, even by accident.\" Dr.\r\nWinkelman studiously avoided all reference to his absence from the\r\nBorough, and Nim Porter was equally cautious for about a month; at the\r\nexpiration of which period Neal Hopper happened to say, in his presence,\r\nhe had good reason to know that Marshal Tigertail was no favorite with\r\nthe President, and would be removed from office before the end of the\r\nnext Congress;--whereupon Nim, very unguardedly and under a sudden,\r\nuncontrollable impulse, planted himself before the miller and said,--\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet you one hundred dollars to ten upon that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I 'spose you know?\" said Neal, struck by Nim's peremptory manner.\r\n\r\n\"Conclusively and distinctly,\" replied Nim with some heat. \"If you\r\nthink Liphalet Fox is going to be the marshal you're mistaken: I know\r\nMartin Van Buren,\" he added with some display of self-importance,\r\n\"considerably--and I can tell you that he goes the whole figure against\r\nrotation in this individual and identical case. He's a Mandarin from\r\nsnout to tail--trained up from the gum, and wouldn't touch a True Grit\r\nwith a forty-foot pole. Martin has defined his position emphatically.\r\nThere can't be a possibility of mistake upon the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say that you heard him say so?\" inquired William\r\nGoodlack, the tailor, a strenuous member of the True Grits, looking\r\nangrily at Nim.\r\n\r\n\"That's neither here nor there,\" replied Nim. \"But I'll stand to the bet\r\nof one hundred dollars to ten, that Tigertail's not turned out of office\r\nthis year: you are welcome to take it yourself, Billy Goodlack, if\r\nyou're a mind for a bet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whoever said Tigertail ought to be turned out?\" asked Goodlack,\r\npeevishly, \"'cepting Neal Hopper, who picked up such a story out of the\r\nnine thousand lies of the Whole Team?\"\r\n\r\nFrom this little brush with Nim Porter, and from the looks that passed\r\nbetween the parties engaged in it, there was room for the inference that\r\nthe President didn't give much encouragement to the committee who went\r\nto him with instructions to turn out the marshal: and this is nearly\r\neverything that has ever transpired in Quodlibet upon that subject. It\r\nis very certain that, for some time after this date, the True Grits were\r\nnot so bold as a party as they had been before. Eliphalet Fox was\r\nundoubtedly much chop-fallen during all the following winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n  A POLITICAL DISCUSSION AT ABEL BRAWN'S SHOP--ABEL'S VIEWS OF\r\n     THE SUB-TREASURY--IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION MADE BY THEODORE\r\n     FOG--THE NEW LIGHTS TAKE GROUND AGAINST THE BANKS--THE HON.\r\n     MIDDLETON FLAM RESIGNS THE PRESIDENCY OF THE COPPERPLATE\r\n     BANK--SNUFFERS ASPIRES TO THE SUCCESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nToward the latter end of August, in the year referred to in the last\r\nchapter, about five o'clock in the afternoon, a much larger collection\r\nthan usual of work horses were seen around Abel Brawn's shop, waiting to\r\nbe shod. The shop stands a few rods below Christy M'Curdy's mill, and\r\nimmediately upon the bank of the Rumblebottom. The mill is just outside\r\nof the compactly-built portion of the Borough; and from the door, Neal\r\nHopper, the miller, could see along the road, on his left hand, into the\r\nprincipal cross street of Quodlibet, and on his right, directly into\r\nAbel Brawn's smith-shop. This advantage of position was much prized by\r\nNeal, because it enabled him to observe everybody going either from the\r\ntown-side or the country-side to the blacksmith's. And as the shop was a\r\nfamous ground for political discussion and newsmongering; and as Neal\r\nhad an insaturable stomach (insaturabile abdomen) for that sort of\r\ngossip, a glance from the mill door gave him the means of knowing who\r\nwas either at or on the way to the shop. Then, if the company suited\r\nhim, he was in the habit of confiding the temporary government of the\r\nmill to a mealy-headed negro called Cicero, who could turn out a grist\r\nas well as himself, and so allow himself the chance of a brush at\r\nargument with Abel Brawn's customers.\r\n\r\nOn this evening in August, as I said, there were more horses than usual\r\nat the smithy. Six or seven men were lounging about the door or in the\r\nshop, talking very loud, with every now and then a word from Abel, who\r\nwas busily employed alternately hammering out shoes on the anvil, and\r\nfitting them to the horses' feet; while squinting Billy Spike, a rather\r\nungainly lad, an apprentice to the smith, was keeping off the flies with\r\na horsetail fastened to the end of a stick. I had been taking a walk\r\nthat evening with some of my boys to look at the ruins of the old\r\nschool-house, and, seeing this little gathering about Abel Brawn's, I\r\nstopped to hear what was going on. Being somewhat fatigued by my\r\nexercitation, I sat down on the bench under the shed, having sent my\r\nboys home by themselves, and remained here a quiet though not an\r\ninattentive spectator of the scene before me. It is by cultivating such\r\nopportunities that I have been enabled to impart that interest to these\r\npages which, without vanity, I may say my reader cannot fail to discover\r\nin them. Such have ever been my choicest and most profitable moments of\r\nobservation--subseciva quaedam tempora, quae ego perire non patiar.\r\n\r\nNeal Hopper was engaged in repairing a bolting-cloth up stairs in the\r\nmill, and, for some time after this assemblage had gathered about the\r\nsmith's shop, did not hear or seem to know what was going forward, until\r\nthere came a loud, sharp laugh and a whoop which aroused his attention.\r\nAs soon as he heard this, he pricked up his ears, listened a moment, and\r\nupon a repetition of the laugh, stepped to the window, looked down\r\ntoward the shop and saw who were there, then called Cicero to finish the\r\nrepair of the bolting-cloth--and went straight to the blacksmith's.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what's the fraction,\" said Neal, \"that you're all a busting out\r\nin such a spell of a laugh about?\"\r\n\r\nHearing Neal's voice, Abel Brawn put down the horse's foot which he was\r\nthen shoeing, from his lap, and standing upright, replied,--\r\n\r\n\"There seems to be a sort of a snarl here among these brother Democrats\r\nof yours, concerning of this here Sub-Treasury. Some of them say it's\r\nagainst the banks, and some of them say it's for the banks. They have\r\ngot it that Cambreling should have give out in Congress that it was\r\ngoing to help the banks and keep them up; and others, on the contrary,\r\nsay that Old Tom Benton swears that it won't leave so much as the skin\r\nof a corporated company 'twixt Down East and the Mississippi. And they\r\nsay, moreover, that little Martin lays dark about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does the Globe give out concerning of it?\" inquired Neal.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the Globe,\" replied Sam Pivot, the assessor of our county, who\r\nwas out for sheriff, and who was very cautious in all his opinions, \"is,\r\nas I take it, a little dubious. Sometimes he makes this Sub-Treasury a\r\nsmasher to all banks; and then again he fetches it up as a sort of staff\r\nto prop the good ones and to knock down the cripples. Last fall, just\r\nbefore the New York election, he rather buttered the banks, seeing that\r\nthe Democracy in that quarter hadn't made up their minds to run as\r\nstrong against the laboring people as they are willing to do over here\r\nin the South. But in April, when the Virginny elections was up, he was\r\nas savage as a meat-ax;--and I rather expect, from what I see in the\r\nPresident's message, that it isn't yet fairly understood whether the\r\nSub-Treasury is to kill or cure the banking system.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a pig in a poke, to make the best of it,\" said Abel Brawn; \"and is\r\nflung before the people now because Van hasn't got nothing better to\r\noffer us, and not because he values it above an old shoe. To my\r\nthinking, when the people have decided against a law, as they have done\r\nnow against this Sub-Treasury, as you call it, twice in Congress, a\r\nPresident of the United States ought to have that respect for the will\r\nof the people to let it drop. That's what I call Whig Democracy--though\r\nit mayn't be yourn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" exclaimed Tom Crop, the constable of our Borough. \"If the\r\npeople go agin the Dimocracy, the Dimocracy ought to put them down. We\r\ngo for principle; and it's our business to try it over and over again,\r\nuntil we carry it. Truth is mighty and _will_ prevail, as the old\r\nGineral says.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never been able,\" said Neal Hopper, \"rightly to make out what\r\nthis Sub-Treasury is, anyhow. If any man knows, let him tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that signify?\" answered Crop. \"Some calls it a divorce--but\r\nbetwixt who I don't know, and what's more, I don't care. It's for the\r\npoor man we are a fighting, against the rich. The Whigs are for making\r\nthe poor poorer, and the rich richer--and I say any man who goes against\r\nthe Sub-Treasury, can't have no respect for Dimmicratic principles.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what it is,\" said Abel Brawn; \"ever since the old\r\nFederals took hold of General Jackson's skirts, and joined him in\r\nbreaking down the banks, they have been plotting to keep their heads\r\nabove water--and so they set about making experiments right and left, to\r\nsee if they couldn't hit upon something new to please the people. But,\r\nbless you--they don't know no more about the people than they do about\r\nmaking horseshoes; and that's the reason why they have been such\r\nbunglers in all their works: and the end has been to bring us into such\r\na pickle as no country ever was in before. They have teetotally ruinated\r\neverything they have laid their hands on--and now they come out and say\r\n'the people expect too much from the Government,' and by way of making\r\nthat saying good, they have got up this Sub-Treasury, which is nothing\r\nmore nor less than a contrivance to get all the money of the country\r\ninto their own strong box, knowing that when they have _the money_, they\r\nhave got _the power_, for as long as they please. That's an old Federal\r\ntrick, which they understand as well as any men in the world. Now the\r\npeople, who see into this scheme, don't like it, and so they vote it\r\ndown in Congress. Well, what does these Federals do then? Submit? No--to\r\nbe sure not--that's not their principle. They go at it again; set to\r\ndrilling of Congress, and by promising this man, and buying off that one\r\nwith an office, and setting their papers to telling all sorts of lies,\r\nthey get the country so confounded at last that it doesn't know whether\r\nit is on its head or its heels. But the worst of it is, these very\r\nFederals--some of them real old Blue Lights--go about preaching about\r\nrich and poor, and sowing enmity between them; and they work so diligent\r\nupon this heat, that many a simple man at last believes them. It's all a\r\ntrick--a mean, sneaking deceit, which I am ashamed to think any honest\r\npoor man in this happy country of ours could be taken in by for one\r\nminute. But we never had this talk until we got Federal measures and\r\nFederal men at the head of the Government. Who are the rich that they\r\ntalk about? Why, it is every man who has sense enough to know that they\r\nare imposing on him, whether he be worth a million or worth only five\r\nhundred dollars--unless indeed it be one of their own rich men, and then\r\nthey can't praise him too much. Is industry a sin in this land, that\r\nwhen it has earned a little something for a wet day, the man who has\r\nthriven by it must be held up as an enemy to his country? Does it hurt a\r\nman's patriotism, when he sends his children to school, and works until\r\nhe can buy a tract of land to start them well in life--or when he rents\r\na pew in church, and carries his family there to teach them to fear God\r\nand keep his commandments? Is it to be told _against_ a man, that his\r\nneighbors count him to be frugal and thrifty, and that he is considered\r\nrespectable in the world? Yet that is your new fashioned Democracy,\r\nwhich wants to put every one in the dust who doesn't idle away his time\r\nand squander his substance, and let his family go to rack, whilst he\r\nstrolls about the country bawling Democracy. Thank God! the Democracy\r\nI've larnt in my time has taught me to do to others as I would have\r\nothers do to me; and which has imbibed into my mind the principle that I\r\nam a freeman, and have a right to think for myself, to speak for myself,\r\nand to act for myself, without having a string put through my nose to\r\nlead me wherever it suits a set of scheming, lying, cunning politicians\r\nto have me for their benefit. Democracy's not what it used to be, or you\r\nwould never find the people putting up with this eternal dictation from\r\nthe President and his friends to Congress and to the nation, what he\r\nwill have, and what he won't have:--that's what I call rank monarchy,\r\nand I will fight against it to my latest breath.\r\n\r\n\"You will have a chance to judge for yourselves whether the\r\nPresident dictates to the people or not, in this very matter of the\r\nSub-Treasury:--wait till the next session of Congress:--the bill has\r\njust been rejected a second time. You will see that Martin isn't a going\r\nto give it up, but will bring it forward again and again--until at last,\r\nI make no doubt, he will get a Congress shabby enough to do his bidding,\r\nand pass it;--and many of the very men who are against it to-day, will\r\nabandon their own opinions and go for it, for no other reason in the\r\nworld but that they will be afraid of their nose-leaders, who will tell\r\nthem they are no Democrats unless they support the President. It is\r\nnothing more nor less than _enlisting_ men in the service, and marching\r\nand countermarching them whichever way the _officers_ choose; besides\r\nbringing every man to a drum-head who dares to disobey orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's Tom Benton's notion?\" inquired Neal Hopper.\r\n\r\n\"He goes for the Sub-Treasury out and out,\" said Pivot.\r\n\r\n\"In course, he does, all hollow,\" interrupted Tom Crop, with rather a\r\nfierce frown and an angry tone, designed to express his indignant\r\nfeeling at the sentiments uttered by Abel Brawn, and which sternness of\r\ncountenance had been gradually gathering during the whole time occupied\r\nby the Blacksmith's discourse. \"There's none of this slang in him. He's\r\nagin all Monypolies, and for the rale Constitutional Currency--and\r\nthem's the genuine Dimmicratic principles:--leastways, they've come\r\nabout so now, whatever they might 'a been in times past. Old Tom's the\r\nfirst man what ever found out what the Constitutional Currency raly was,\r\nand sot the Dimmicrats a goin' on the Hard-Money track! And, besides,\r\ndon't I know these banks?--they're nuisances in grain, and naturally as\r\ngood as strikes a poor man in his vitals. I've seed it myself. Here was\r\nJoe Plumb, the cider-press maker, got a note from Jerry Lantern down\r\nhere at the crossroads, for settin' up his cider-press, and he heaved it\r\nin the bank for them to collect it--and what does the bank do, but go\r\nand _purtest_ it! That's the way they treat a poor man like Joe Plumb,\r\nwhat's obliged to work for his livin':--would they 'a sarved a Big Bug\r\nso? No--don't tell me about the banks! I'm sick a hearin' on 'em.\"\r\n\r\nThis discussion was now interrupted by the approach of Theodore Fog,\r\nFlan Sucker, and Sim Travers. By this addition to the company, the New\r\nLights gained an overwhelming preponderance of numbers over their\r\nadversaries. Indeed, Abel Brawn, and Davy Post, the wheelwright, were\r\nthe only Whigs in the assemblage; and the consequence was that Abel, who\r\nfought them all pretty manfully at first, was obliged to give in so far\r\nas to remain silent--with the exception of a random shot, which now and\r\nthen he let off by way of repartee--Abel not being bad at that. Davy\r\nPost was naturally a silent man, and, therefore, did not pretend to be a\r\nspeaker on this occasion.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Theodore Fog was informed what was the topic in debate, and\r\nespecially of the doubts which seemed to be prevalent regarding the\r\nSub-Treasury, he took a station against the door-post, where the whole\r\ncompany gathered around him; and, being now in an oratorical mood, he\r\nbegan to address the auditory in something like a speech:--\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, at the same time drawing, with a jerk, his\r\nneckcloth away and flaunting it in his hand, \"in a free government we\r\nhave no secrets. Freedom of Opinion and its twin-sister Freedom of\r\nDiscussion are chartered libertines that float upon the ambient air\r\nconsecrated to the Genius of Universal Emancipation----\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurra for old The!\" shouted Sim Travers.\r\n\r\n\"Ya--hoop--halloo--go it!\" yelled Flan Sucker, with a wild and deafening\r\nscream, which sufficiently manifested the fact that he was most noisily\r\ndrunk.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the company interfered by remonstrating with Flan against\r\nthis unnecessary demonstration of fervor, which Flan, on the other hand,\r\ninsisted upon as his right.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever old The. Fog comes out high flown,\" said he, \"I yells as a\r\nmatter of principle. It's encouragin' to youth. Nebuchadnezzar, the King\r\nof the Jews, couldn't beat him at a speech: he's the butt cut of\r\nDemocracy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Flan, hold your tongue,\" said Theodore. \"Gentlemen, we have no secrets.\r\nAbel Brawn and Davy Post are welcome to hear all I have to impart. I\r\nknow--everybody knows--that we have been in a state of suspense on the\r\ngreat question of the Sub-Treasury. The INDEPENDENT Treasury, as we are\r\ngoing to call it since Congress rejected it--we'll try what a new name\r\nwill do. I say we have been in suspense. Like honest New Lights we have\r\nwaited to see how the cat would jump. Some men imagined that Martin\r\nwould bow to the judgment of the people and give it up. They did not\r\nknow the stern, uncompromising, footstep-following principles that dwell\r\nat the bottom of his heart. He will _never_ give it up--the people\r\n_must_ take it: he has got nothing else for them. Hasn't he tried\r\neverything else? And isn't this the _last_ thing he could think of? Why,\r\nthen, of course, the people _must_ gulp it down, or the party is broke.\r\nWhere is the slave that would desert his party? Who's here so base would\r\nbe a turncoat? The Whigs call the President the _servant_ of the\r\npeople--we call him the Ruler, the Great Chieftain,--and when a man\r\ndeserts him he is a TURNCOAT--that is sound New-Light doctrine.\r\n\r\n\"Sirs, it has been developed in the recent demonstrations of\r\ncontemporary history----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yip!\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence, Flan Sucker, and don't make a fool of yourself. It has been\r\ndiscovered that bank influence has defeated the Sub-Treasury bill. Every\r\nmember who voted against it has received a large bribe from the banks.\r\nThe Globe man has lately discovered this astounding corruption: the\r\nPresident is aware of it; and for this reason, in addition to that which\r\nI have already mentioned, he is determined to run it as the INDEPENDENT\r\nTreasury again. Every New Light is expected to toe the mark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three cheers for that!\" cried Pivot.\r\n\r\n\"We have heretofore _partially_ denounced the banks,\" continued Fog; \"we\r\nare now to open upon them like hounds--worry them like rats. From this\r\nday forth, the Quods will take a new turn;--they will dismiss all pity\r\nfrom their bosoms, and cry aloud for strangling the banks--not even\r\nexcepting our own. Patriotism demands the sacrifice. Down with paper\r\nmoney! will be the word. Turn the tables on the Whigs, and call the\r\nwhole bank system the spawn of aristocracy--remember that. At the same\r\ntime, gentlemen, be not afraid. No harm will be done to any bank you\r\nhave a liking for--the essence of the thing is in the noise. We shall\r\nhave perhaps to kill the banks in the District of Columbia--but that's\r\nnothing;--it will be an offering to consistency. All experiments require\r\nan exhausted receiver--and the District is ours;--a snug little piece of\r\nmachinery to play upon. So keep it in mind--Treasury Notes and no Paper\r\nMoney!--down with Credit, and up with the Independent Treasury!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ain't that first-rate?\" said Sim Travers. \"The., who sot that agoin'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?\" replied Fog. \"Why, some of the highest men in this nation--the\r\nLights of the age. Middleton Flam has just received letters from\r\nWashington, laying open the whole plan of operations. He has accordingly\r\ndetermined to put himself in position for ultimate action, by resigning\r\nthe presidency of the bank. Middleton Flam, gentlemen, I am free to say\r\nit, although we have differed on some questions, is a great man and an\r\nhonor to the New Lights. He has already sent his resignation to\r\nNicodemus Handy. The Board meet to-morrow to act upon it. You may\r\nimagine, gentlemen, who is looked to as his successor. But I here\r\nannounce to _you_, the conglomerate essence of my constituency at large,\r\nthat on no consideration can I be persuaded to accept the vacant place.\r\nNo, gentlemen, the whole tenor of my life renders that impossible. I\r\nhave defined my position years ago; and every man must see, that\r\npresident of that, or any other bank, I can never be. Simon Snuffers is\r\nthe man. If he can make it agreeable to the Democratic principle upon\r\nwhich he holds the Hay Scales--and that it is for you to say--I have no\r\ndoubt he will accept. Simon has no ulterior objects;--and men without\r\nulterior objects may do as they please. But I trust that this\r\nresponsible post will never be pressed upon me. Upon that point I cannot\r\nindulge the wishes of my friends.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance of this speech was duly appreciated by those to whom it\r\nwas addressed; and as every man was anxious to know what everybody else\r\nthought about these matters, there was an immediate adjournment to the\r\nBorough. The consequence was, that Abel Brawn's shop was left in a few\r\nmoments without a customer; and in the course of the next half hour the\r\nnews communicated by Theodore Fog was in every man's mouth. The movement\r\nat Washington was held to be decisive. The Independent Treasury, from\r\nthat moment, became a leading test of the allegiance of the Democrats of\r\nQuodlibet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n  LETTER FROM A CABINET OFFICER TO MR. FLAM--DIRECTIONS TO THE\r\n     DEMOCRACY--THE CABINET OFFICER'S MODE OF PRODUCING AN\r\n     IMPRESSION--THE PRESIDENT'S DETERMINATION IN REGARD TO THE\r\n     INDEPENDENT TREASURY--WARNING TO DESERTERS--CANDIDATES FOR\r\n     MR. FLAM'S PLACE IN THE BANK--HARDBOTTLE ELECTED--THEODORE\r\n     FOG'S OUTBREAK--HE COOLS DOWN AND STANDS UPON\r\n     PRINCIPLE--HARDBOTTLE UNPOPULAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact was as Theodore Fog had stated it. Mr. Flam had received a\r\nletter from a member of the Cabinet, apprising him that it was deemed\r\nabsolutely necessary to the preservation of the New-Light Democratic\r\nParty to become extremely pointed in their assault against the State\r\nBanks, and that the misdeeds of those institutions should be exaggerated\r\nas much as possible, and then charged upon the Whigs.\r\n\r\n\"This attack,\" said the letter, \"must be made with more than usual\r\nclamor, and followed up with unremitting industry, that, by force of the\r\nfirst word and incessant repetition, we may get the people to believe\r\nthat we have had nothing to do with the creation of these corporations;\r\nbut have, in fact, been inveterately hostile to them from the first, and\r\nthat our opponents have been their sole patrons and friends. Our recent\r\noutcry on this subject has succeeded so well with the people, that we\r\nare determined now to make the denunciation of the banks our chief\r\ntopic, by way of preparation for the Independent Treasury which we are\r\nresolved the people shall swallow. We cannot too strongly impress upon\r\nour friends the propriety of charging upon the Whigs that we have\r\nrepeatedly warned them against increasing the number of banks in the\r\nStates. By this device we shall put upon their shoulders all those\r\nmischiefs of _over-banking_ and _over-trading_, which _they_ used to\r\ntalk about. We must impute to them all the evils of the paper\r\nsystem--except the Treasury notes, which it would be well for us to\r\npraise, as an admirable Democratic scheme to give the country a METALLIC\r\ncurrency. It has also been deemed important,\" continued the writer,\r\n\"that we should prove that the government has lost more money by the\r\nState banks than by any other agents it has ever employed. This idea was\r\nhinted to the Secretary of the Treasury, who has, in consequence, very\r\nrecently been at work upon the subject, and has produced a report\r\naltogether conclusive against the banks. He will continue these labors\r\nwith a view to the instruction of Congress and all our other inquiring\r\nfriends; being, in no respect, daunted by that unlucky report made by\r\nhim in 1834, which, singularly enough, proves the opposite side of the\r\ncase; for, as he remarks, the specific gravity of his State papers is so\r\ngreat as to sink them too deep for the perception of the present\r\ngeneration,--and that consequently his report of 1834 must be pretty\r\nwell forgotten by this time, which, indeed, I think quite likely;--it\r\nwas so long-winded, dozy, and prosy, (a note in the margin marked this\r\nas 'confidential,') that I should not wonder if more than ten men in\r\nCongress ever read it, and of those, perhaps not a single one retains\r\nany distinct impression of its meaning.\" The letter exhorted Mr. Flam to\r\nmake these views known to the drill sergeants and corporals of the party\r\nin Quodlibet, and to stimulate them to active exertions in the part\r\nassigned to them. \"Pound it into public mind,\" said the writer, \"that\r\nthe Whigs are the authors of the present evils; continual pounding will\r\ninevitably, at last, do the business. Many a time have I riveted, by\r\ndiligent hammering, a politic and necessary fabrication upon the\r\ncredulity of the people--so fast that no art of my adversary could tear\r\nit away to make room for the truth: therefore, I say to you and our\r\nDemocratic friends--hammer without ceasing.\"\r\n\r\nA letter also from the Secretary, at the same time, informed Mr. Flam,\r\nthat as the people had so contumaciously rejected the Independent\r\nTreasury bill, by their representatives in Congress, the President was\r\nnow determined to carry it at all hazards; and consequently it was\r\nexpected that no New-Light Democrat would be so false to the glorious\r\nprinciples of the Quodlibetarian theory as to interpose any opinion of\r\nhis own between the will of the President and the appropriate duty of\r\nthe people. \"If such should be the case,\" said the Secretary, \"Mr. Van\r\nBuren can have no alternative--the individual so recreant to the eternal\r\nprinciples of the New-Light Democracy must be denounced by the Globe as\r\nan enemy to freedom, and, what is worse, a traitor to his party.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Flam reflected upon these communications with grave attention; and\r\nhaving shown them to some of his intimate friends, among whom I count it\r\nmy highest honor to be ranked, he announced his purpose to resign his\r\npost in the bank. For this step he had two good reasons: the first was\r\nthe necessity of disencumbering himself of a connection which might have\r\nimpeded his usefulness--to use his own words--in his public relations;\r\nthe second reason was, that he had borrowed so large an amount from the\r\nbank, as to circumscribe its bounty greatly to the prejudice of sundry\r\nof the directors who were, in consequence, beginning to complain of his\r\nmanagement of the institution, and were even threatening to run an\r\nopposition against him in the election which was but a few months off.\r\nIt was whispered also that Nicodemus Handy had given him a mysterious\r\nbut friendly hint to resign, without explaining his reasons. Upon these\r\nconsiderations his mind was made up; and accordingly the resignation was\r\nlaid before the Board at the time indicated by Theodore Fog.\r\n\r\nThis event produced great sensation in Quodlibet; not less from the\r\ncuriosity to know why our distinguished representative should relinquish\r\nso lucrative a post, than from the interest felt in the measure of\r\nselecting his successor. Fifteen of our most strenuous New-Light\r\nDemocrats were candidates; and notwithstanding the speech made at the\r\nblacksmith's shop, Theodore Fog was the first who wrote a letter to the\r\nBoard to apprise them that, in consequence of the eager importunity of\r\nhis Democratic friends to confide the bank to his management, he found\r\nhimself compelled to forego his objections to having any concern with\r\nthe banking system, and therefore would not feel himself at liberty to\r\ndecline the Presidency in case it should be offered to him. He said he\r\nwished it to be distinctly understood, that emolument was not his\r\nobject: but that he was actuated solely by his attachment to that\r\nNew-Light Democratic principle which taught him on all occasions to seek\r\npreferment, as the means of widening the sphere of his usefulness, and\r\nto increase his worldly fortune only for the sake of the good it enabled\r\nhim to dispense to the people. On no other terms was he willing to\r\naccept the government of the bank.\r\n\r\nSome two or three days were spent in canvassing this matter; when the\r\nchoice ultimately, upon the twenty-fifth balloting, fell upon Anthony\r\nHardbottle, who had not been previously thought of for the place, and\r\nwas only brought forward when all attempts to elect others had failed.\r\nThe fifteen original candidates became greatly incensed at this choice.\r\nTheodore Fog was furious: he said Hardbottle could scarcely be called a\r\nDemocrat:--if anything, he was half Whig--nay, he believed, whole\r\nWhig:--and to elect a Whig to a great responsible post like that--a post\r\nconnected with the national fisc, allied to the money power, so\r\nintimately related to the important concerns of the currency!--it was\r\nnot to be tolerated. The Genius of New-Light Democracy should array\r\nherself in steel, indue herself in panoply, buckle on her armor, shake\r\nher lance against it, or, in other words, he deemed it incompatible with\r\nfree institutions to allow a Whig, or, at least, a man who never\r\nattended political meetings, and who held the Whigs in respect--to\r\npreside over such a Democratic institution as the Copperplate Bank of\r\nQuodlibet. Theodore continued raving in this strain until he drank nine\r\njuleps, interspersed with numberless other potations, and became so\r\nincapable of motion as to render it necessary for Mrs. Ferret to have\r\nhim carried to bed. As he cooled, so cooled his competitors. Indeed, in\r\nthe course of a few days, Theodore Fog, in commenting upon the\r\npretensions of the several defeated candidates, found so many objections\r\nto them individually and collectively, as to bring himself into an\r\nexcellent temper upon the subject, whereby he was able to make merry\r\nwith the whole election; and thus, by degrees, he fell back into the\r\nstate of mind which he had manifested at the smith's shop, and declared\r\nthat no consideration could possibly induce him, professing the\r\nprinciples he did, to accept any post connected with a bank. He\r\nexpressed himself in sharp and censorious terms against what, he said,\r\nhe had constantly observed: namely, that he never knew a post in a bank\r\nto be vacant, from the President down to the porter, including Directors\r\nand all, in regard to which he didn't find half a dozen Loco Focos, to\r\nsay nothing of New-Light Democrats, applicants to fill the vacancy: he\r\nthought it inconsistent with principle, now that orders had come for the\r\nDemocracy to abuse the banks, to seek or accept such places; and he did\r\nnot care who knew his sentiments upon the subject.\r\n\r\nMr. Hardbottle was a strict man of business, and did not, it is true,\r\ngreatly interest himself in politics. Yet, nevertheless, he was a\r\ndecided supporter of the New-Light cause, and was always esteemed a\r\nuseful member of the Borough. One thing that made against him in the\r\nBoard was, that he had never been a very active customer to the bank,\r\nexcept so far only as keeping his commercial account there. He was often\r\nurged to accept accommodations with a view to the improvement of the\r\nBorough, but almost invariably refused, from an aversion to indulging in\r\nthese useful speculations. His brother Directors, in consequence, rather\r\nregarded him as a man who was deficient in public spirit; and they\r\nimagined that he might be inclined to depreciate the value of the\r\nservices they had rendered the bank by the liberal employment they had\r\ngiven to its funds. Mr. Hardbottle, therefore, might be said to\r\nhave entered into the government of the bank under inauspicious\r\ncircumstances, and was likely not to be a very popular President. He\r\nwas, however, determined upon one thing, and that was to make a thorough\r\nexamination of the bank for the purpose of bringing about a resumption\r\nof specie payments at the earliest possible moment; for some complaints\r\nhad gone abroad against the Bank of Quodlibet for not resuming when the\r\nother banks of the country affected to be anxious for that measure.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this determination of the new President, the bank was\r\nkept in perpetual bustle for the whole fortnight succeeding the\r\nelection. What then occurred will be told in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n  UNHAPPY EVENT IN THE LIFE OF NICODEMUS HANDY--CONSTERNATION\r\n     OF QUODLIBET--DISASTERS AMONG THE DIRECTORS--EXPLOSION\r\n     OF THE BANK--CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEODORE FOG AND MR.\r\n     GRANT--FOG'S VIEWS OF THE QUESTION OF DISTRESS--COMPLIMENT\r\n     TO JESSE FERRET.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know not which way to turn. Auribus teneo lupum. I can scarcely\r\ncompose myself to write. Such an event! Many things have happened in\r\nthis world to excite wonder, many grief, many indignation, many wailing,\r\nlamentation, and moans; but we have had an incident in the Borough which\r\novermasters all these emotions by the height and the depth, the length\r\nand the breadth, the stupendous magnitude of the amazement which it has\r\nspread through all minds.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the affairs of the bank, under the direction of Mr.\r\nHardbottle, lasted more than a fortnight. They were not yet brought to a\r\nclose, when---- Let the following paragraph from an extra Whole Hog,\r\nissued on the spur of the moment, tell the rest. I have no nerve for\r\nsuch a disclosure.\r\n\r\n     \"ASTOUNDING WHIG DEFALCATION.\r\n\r\n     \"Our Borough has just been thrown into a state of stupefaction by\r\n     an event which completely eclipses every other act of crime and\r\n     villainy with which the annals of Whiggery abound. Nicodemus Handy,\r\n     the Whig Cashier of that extortionate, swindling Whig rag-factory,\r\n     the Patriotic Copperplate Bank of Quodlibet, left this Borough\r\n     yesterday morning in the People's Line, which runs through Thorough\r\n     Blue. As this journey was undertaken with the pretense of\r\n     business, it attracted no attention until this morning, when the\r\n     indefatigable Democratic President of that institution, Mr. Anthony\r\n     Hardbottle, who was recently elected for the purpose of a thorough\r\n     investigation into its concerns, (suspicions having been\r\n     long indulged of its rottenness; and, in fact, our worthy\r\n     representative, the Hon. Middleton Flam, an unterrified and\r\n     incorruptible New Light, having retired from the head of the\r\n     institution on account of the disgusting irregularities which fell\r\n     within his view,) laid a statement before the Board which showed\r\n     that the Cashier had secreted upwards of $160,000, the greater part\r\n     of which funds there is reason to believe he has made away with in\r\n     the course of the last three months. Measures were taken to pursue\r\n     the offender, and as far as possible to secure the bank\r\n     by attachments upon his property, which is supposed to be\r\n     considerable. For the present, we forbear all comment, except so\r\n     far as to remark, that we look upon this atrocious fraud but as the\r\n     natural fruit of that system of Whig measures which has cumbered\r\n     the land with mushroom banks, filthy rags, and swarms of scrub\r\n     aristocrats in the shape of presidents, cashiers, directors, and\r\n     clerks. We may speedily expect to hear of many more Whigs following\r\n     the example of our absquatulating Cashier.\"\r\n\r\nThe sensation produced in the Borough by this intelligence is not to be\r\ndescribed. The flight of Mr. Handy was the only topic of conversation\r\nfor a week. An officer followed him to Thorough Blue, whence, it was\r\nrumored, the fugitive had shaped his course for Texas: other reports\r\nassigned Canada as his place of refuge--all was uncertainty. Legal\r\nmeasures were taken to secure his property. This consisted of his\r\nelegant mansion on Copperplate Ridge, sundry rows of warehouses, and\r\nother buildings in Quodlibet, a large number of which had been left for\r\ntwo years past in an unfinished state. Upon investigation it was\r\nascertained that the whole of this estate had been converted into money;\r\nour worthy representative, the Hon. Middleton Flam, having an absolute\r\nconveyance for Handy House, its furniture, and appurtenances, and\r\ncertain political friends, connected with the custom-house in New York,\r\nrank Whigs, having mortgages on all the rest of the property. The\r\nconsequence was, the bank was able to secure nothing.\r\n\r\nOne of our first proceedings, after the flight of the Cashier, was to\r\ncall together the New-Light Club, where resolutions were passed\r\ndenouncing his fraud as the necessary consequence of his Whig\r\nprinciples, censuring the bank, in the strongest terms, as a swindling\r\nWhig concern, and avowing an unalterable devotion to the Independent\r\nTreasury, as the only sound, genuine, New-Light Democratic experiment\r\nwhich it was proper for the government to make, in the present condition\r\nof affairs--unless the President should change his mind and find out\r\nsomething still more Democratic; in which event the New-Light Club\r\npledged itself to give that other measure their cordial and patriotic\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a fortnight, the inhabitants of the Borough were\r\nsurprised to read from a New York paper, in the list of passengers who\r\nsailed for Liverpool by the packet of the first of October, among the\r\nnames of sundry fashionables, those also of Mrs. and Miss Handy; and we\r\nwere, not long afterward, relieved from all doubt as to the Cashier's\r\ndestination, by seeing it publicly announced that he had gone to Havre,\r\nfrom which point, as soon as he could be joined by his interesting and\r\ndistressed family, he designed making the tour of Europe.\r\n\r\nFrom the period of the elopement of Mr. Handy, we had a series of\r\nconvulsions. The first incident of importance that followed it, was the\r\nfailure of the whole Board of Directors; each of whom, according to his\r\nown showing, had lost so much money by the absconding Cashier as to be\r\ntotally unable to pay up his liabilities to the bank. The next disaster\r\nwas the explosion of the bank itself. The abduction of so large an\r\namount of its funds, as well as its unfortunate list of bad debts from\r\nthe Directors, rendered this inevitable. Then came riots among the\r\nholders of its paper, who besieged the door for several days, and even\r\nthreatened to pull down the building. Never was a community in a more\r\nunhappy commotion than ours at this eventful epoch.\r\n\r\nMr. Grant visited the Borough frequently during the prevalence of these\r\ndisorders. One day he met Theodore Fog, who seemed to be rather\r\npleasurably excited by the events which occupied and engrossed the\r\npublic attention--for Theodore, as he was in the habit of remarking, had\r\nnothing to lose by these domestic convulsions, and everything to gain.\r\nThe election was at hand, and he was again the True-Grit candidate; but\r\non this occasion there was no opposition from his own party, and the\r\nchance of electing a Whig was deemed hopeless. That side made no\r\nnomination; and Fog, therefore, with his two colleagues of the last\r\nyear, was in a fair way to walk over the course without a contest. The\r\ninterests of the election, consequently, were altogether absorbed in the\r\nother incidents of the day. Still, Theodore was not inattentive to the\r\nvoters, and was, as usual, loquacious and voluble.\r\n\r\n\"A pretty considerable upheaving of the elements of social life, Mr.\r\nGrant,\" said he, upon encountering the old gentleman on Ferret's steps\r\nat the front door of The Hero.\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" replied Mr. Grant; \"you have brought your pigs at last to\r\na fine market.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Our_ pigs!\" exclaimed Fog, with an excellent representation of\r\nsurprise:--\"well, that beats M'Gonegal, and he beat the devil. The whole\r\nlitter comes from a Whig mother: it is the spawn of that aristocracy,\r\nagainst which the intelligence, the honor, and the virtue of the nation\r\nhave been waging war ever since the Reign of Terror;--but, sir, it is\r\ndown; the intelligence and firmness of the people have triumphed at\r\nlast.\"\r\n\r\n\"You allude, I suppose, to your Democratic bank here,\" said Mr. Grant.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt,\" replied Fog, \"the Whigs will attempt to shuffle the bank\r\noff _their_ shoulders and buckle it on the Democrats. But that won't do,\r\nsir; that's too stale a trick to deceive the people. The Whigs, sir, are\r\nmen of property; the Democrats are poor, sir. Banks are not made by poor\r\nmen, Mr. Grant; there's the logic of the case.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this Patriotic Copperplate Bank of Quodlibet was not set on foot by\r\nNicodemus Handy and Theodore Fog?\" returned Mr. Grant.\r\n\r\n\"By Nicodemus Handy,\" replied Fog, \"not by me. Sir, Nicodemus was always\r\na Whig; and, what's more, attempted to beguile me into his scheme. He\r\ntook advantage of my unsuspecting temper--endeavored to lull into\r\nsecurity my artless, confiding nature; essayed, sir, but in vain, to\r\nseduce me from my allegiance to the Democratic faith, by tempting offers\r\nof the presidency of the bank--but, sir, my virtue was too stern for his\r\ntreacherous arts. I saw the gilded bait and spurned it. It was--I say it\r\nmyself--a rare example of successful resistance to the fascinations of\r\nthe tempter. Many a Democrat has fallen into the snare of the Whigs\r\nunder less allurement. I pride myself on this evidence of self-command.\r\nI have reason to be proud of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a short memory,\" said Mr. Grant.\r\n\r\n\"Why as to that, old friend,\" replied Fog with a good-natured laugh, at\r\nthe same time laying his hand on Mr. Grant's shoulder, \"you can't call\r\n_that_ a fault. Every politician has a short memory--he'd be no\r\npolitician without it. Mine's no shorter than the rest. Sir, let me tell\r\nyou, the great secret of the success of the immutable, New-Light,\r\nQuodlibetarian Democracy, is in the shortness of the memory. Still, I\r\nwould like to know what you mean by the remark.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean to say,\" replied Mr. Grant, \"that when you and Nicodemus Handy\r\nwere endeavoring to persuade me to take an interest in your bank, you\r\ndidn't think it so undemocratic as you seem to do to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible for me to remember what I said on the occasion to\r\nwhich you allude, sir,\" returned Fog; \"but my principles have always\r\nbeen the same. I could not have gone against them, sir; morally\r\nimpossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I told you that your bank was a humbug,\" continued Mr. Grant.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" rejoined Fog; \"that's the old song. You Whigs are monstrous\r\ngood at prophesying after the result is known.\"\r\n\r\n\"You admit, I suppose,\" said Mr. Grant, \"that this Bank of Quodlibet has\r\nexploded?\"\r\n\r\n\"Burst, sir, into a thousand tatters,\" replied Fog.\r\n\r\n\"You admit that there is a large amount of paper money afloat?\"\r\n\r\n\"A genuine Whig crop,\" answered Fog: \"enough to make a stack as large as\r\nthe largest in your barnyard.\"\r\n\r\n\"You admit the derangement of values all over the country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and of the people too, if you make it a point.\"\r\n\r\n\"The failures of traders and of banks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is reasonable, Mr. Fog. Now, you shall judge whether the Whigs\r\nprophesy _before_ or _after_ the result,\" said Mr. Grant, as he thrust\r\nhis hand into his skirt pocket and drew forth a pamphlet. \"I expected to\r\nmeet you to-day, and I have brought you a document for your especial\r\nperusal. It is the speech of a Whig member of Congress, made in 1834,\r\nupon the Removal of the Deposits;--you will find the leaf turned down at\r\npage 32; and, as you are a good reader, I wish you would favor this\r\ncompany by reading it aloud, where you see it scored in the margin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I,\" replied Theodore; \"that's four years ago. The statute of\r\nlimitation bars that.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's afeard to read it,\" said Abel Brawn to some five or six persons,\r\nwho had collected around the steps during this conversation. \"Mr.\r\nGrant's mighty particular with his documents, and ain't to be shook off\r\nin an argument.\"\r\n\r\n\"The., you ain't afeard, old fellow?\" said Flan Sucker. \"Walk into him,\r\nThe. Read it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me the book,\" said Fog, \"and let's see what it is. Speech by\r\nHorace Binney--eh? Who's he? I think I have heard the name. Well, for\r\nthe sake of obliging a friend, I'll read.--_Conticuere omnes_--which\r\nmeans listen.\" Fog then read as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"It is here that we find a pregnant source of the present agony--it is\r\nin the clearly avowed design to bring a second time upon this land the\r\ncurse of an unregulated, uncontrolled State-Bank paper currency. We are\r\nagain to see the drama which already, in the course of the present\r\ncentury, has passed before us, and closed in ruin. If the project shall\r\nbe successful----\"\r\n\r\n\"What project?\" inquired Fog.\r\n\r\n\"The destruction of the Bank of the United States, and the refusal to\r\ncreate another in its place,\" answered Mr. Grant.\r\n\r\nTheodore read on--\r\n\r\n     \"If the project shall be successful, we are again to see these\r\n     paper missiles shooting in every direction through the country--a\r\n     derangement of all values,--a depreciated circulation--a suspension\r\n     of specie payments;--then a further extension of the same\r\n     detestable paper--a still greater depreciation--with failures of\r\n     traders and failures of banks in its train--to arrive at last at\r\n     the same point from which we departed in 1817.\"\r\n\r\n\"A rank forgery,\" said Theodore Fog, \"printed for the occasion.\"\r\n\r\n\"That won't do,\" replied Mr. Grant; \"I have been the owner of this\r\npamphlet ever since 1834 myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then Binney is a Dimmycrat,\" said Sim Travers, \"and you are trying to\r\npass him off on us for a Whig. Sound Dimmycratic doctrine and true\r\nprophecy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Huzza for Binney!\" shouted Flan Sucker, \"a tip-top Dimmycrat, whoever\r\nhe is!--I never heard of him before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Grant, \"one ounce of his Democracy is worth a ton weight\r\nof the best you will find in the Globe. But read on, a little further\r\nbelow, where you see it scored.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have an innate and mortal aversion to reading,\" returned Fog.\r\n\r\n\"It must be gone through,\" said Flan Sucker,--\"because them sentiments\r\nis the rale Dimmocracy, and we want to hear them. So, go it,\r\nThe!--Yip--listen boys, to the doctrine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Fog, \"if you will have it--as the pillory said to the\r\nthief, 'lend me your ears.'\"\r\n\r\n     \"I thank the Secretary,\" he began with a discreet voice, reading\r\n     where Mr. Grant appointed for him, \"for the disclosure of this\r\n     plan. I trust in God it will be defeated: that the Bank of the\r\n     United States, while it is in existence, may be sustained and\r\n     strengthened by the public opinion, and interests of the people, to\r\n     defeat it: that the sound and sober State banks of the Union may\r\n     resist it--for it is their cause: that the poor men and laborers in\r\n     the land may resist it--for it is a scheme to get from every one of\r\n     them a dollar's worth of labor for fifty cents, and to make fraud\r\n     the currency of the country as much as paper. Sir, the Bank of the\r\n     United States, in any other relation than to the currency and\r\n     property of the country, is as little to me as to any man under\r\n     heaven; but after the prime and vigor of life are passed, and the\r\n     power of accumulation is gone, to see the children stripped, by the\r\n     monstrous imposture of a paper currency, of all that the father's\r\n     industry had provided for them--this, sir, may well excuse the\r\n     warmth that denounces this plan, as the precursor of universal\r\n     dismay and ruin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll read no more,\" said Fog, giving back the book, with a theatrical\r\nflourish of his arm, to Mr. Grant; \"it is nothing more than stealing our\r\nprinciples from us, and then bringing them up to break our heads.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is good Whig prophecy, four years before its fulfillment,\" said Mr.\r\nGrant, \"and which has come true to the letter. It shows you that we set\r\nour faces against your increase of banks in the very beginning; gave you\r\nwarning of what was to come; painted the very evils of this day so\r\nplainly before your eyes that nothing but willful blindness prevented\r\nyou from seeing them; and now, when it has all fallen out as it was\r\nforetold, you attempt to make us responsible to the people for your\r\nmeasures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said Fog, rather evading the argument, as it is an admirable part\r\nof the New-Light system to do when it pinches, \"the New-Light Democracy\r\nchanges its measures, but never its principles. We go, sir, for the will\r\nof the people--that's the principle which lies at the bottom of all our\r\nactions. If the people are for new measures, we frankly come out with\r\nthem. Now, sir, the people are _against_ the banks--they are _for_ the\r\nIndependent Treasury: of course, then, you know where to find _us_. You\r\ncan't get round us--there we are.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll not dispute that point with you,\" replied Mr. Grant; \"you have\r\nbeen changing from bad to worse ever since you have had the control of\r\naffairs. I only wanted to remind you that the present distress of the\r\ncountry is the work of your own hands, and that you have brought it\r\nabout with your eyes open.\"\r\n\r\nSaying these words Mr. Grant walked off toward the stable, where he\r\nmounted his horse and rode out of the Borough.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the old gentleman was gone, Theodore Fog remarked that he\r\nhad not had as dry a talk for some years, and proposed to the company a\r\ngeneral visit to the bar.\r\n\r\n\"They talk of _distress_,\" said he. \"Mr. Grant has gone off with his\r\nhead full of that notion of distress; it's a famous Whig argument, that.\r\nBut what distress is there? Drinking's as cheap; eating's as cheap as\r\never; so is lying. Eating, drinking, and lying, are the three principal\r\noccupations of man. Lying _down_, I mean, metaphorically for sleeping.\r\nWhere's the distress, then? Mere panic--false alarm--a Whig invention!\r\nThe country is better off than it ever was before. Not for men who trade\r\nupon credit, I allow--not for merchants and shippers in general--not for\r\nyour fellows that go about for jobs--not for farmers--not for regular\r\nlaborers--not for mechanics, with families on their hands, and\r\nperhaps not for single ones neither;--but first-rate for lawyers,\r\nbar-keepers, and brokers, for marshals and sheriffs--capital for\r\nconstables--nonpareil for postmasters, contractors, express-riders, and\r\noffice-holders; and glorious for fellows that are fond of talking and\r\nhave nothing to do:--these are the very gristle of the New-Light\r\nDemocracy, and make a genteel majority at the elections.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fog,\" said Jesse Ferret, \"I am so well pleased at your reading for\r\nMr. Grant this morning, that I'm determined to give you a treat;--help\r\nyourself and your friends. Gentlemen, walk up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Glad you liked it, old buck,\" replied Fog. \"Bless your heart, I'm\r\nused to such things. A political man must always be ready for rubbers;\r\nnever would get a gloss if it wasn't for brushing. That Binney's a smart\r\nfellow; but every word of that speech was whispered into his ear by\r\nBenton; I know the fact personally. He and Benton sit up every night of\r\ntheir lives together in Washington, playing old sledge and drinking\r\ncocktail: that accounts for Binney's Democracy. Gentlemen, our friend\r\nFerret's treat--we'll drink his health--a worthy, persuadable, amenable\r\nman--so here's to him. Wait for the word--Jesse Ferret, a gentleman and\r\na scholar, an antiquarian and a tavern-keeper--long life to him!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n  A RAPID REVIEW OF ONE YEAR--WHAT THE AUTHOR IS COMPELLED TO\r\n     PRETERMIT--THE PRESIDENT'S \"SOBER SECONDTHOUGHT\" MESSAGE\r\n     RECEIVED AT QUODLIBET WITH GREAT REJOICING--THE AUTHOR\r\n     COMMUNES WITH HIS READER TOUCHING NEW-LIGHT\r\n     PRINCIPLES--ILLUSTRATIONS OF THEM--REMARKABLE DEXTERITY OF\r\n     THE SECRETARY--INTERESTING LETTER FROM THE HON. MIDDLETON\r\n     FLAM--DAWNING OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CANVASS--THE NORTHERN MAN\r\n     WITH SOUTHERN PRINCIPLES AND HIS MANNIKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTime held his course. Another year went by, and brought us to the sixth\r\nsince the Removal. The year which I pass over was marked by many public\r\nand domestic incidents worthy of note in the history of Quodlibet.\r\nGladly would I have tarried to entertain my reader with some of these;\r\nbut I am admonished of the necessity of bringing these desultory annals\r\nto a close. Especially might I find much to interest many of those who\r\nwill peruse these pages, in the private and personal affairs of the\r\nBorough; some of the events of the bygone year being of a nature to\r\nkindle up pathetic emotions in their bosoms. The blank despair of\r\nAgamemnon Flag when he first heard of the flight of Nicodemus Handy; his\r\nmelancholy visits of consolation to the bereaved family; the\r\ndisinterested avowal of his long-smothered and smouldering love to the\r\nheiress apparent; and his offer of his hand and fortune--consisting of a\r\nnew suit of clothes, and a horse and gig, purchased on credit--to this\r\ndejected lady; his still blanker despair, his disappointment and vows of\r\nrevenge when, after listening to his suit, he found it announced that\r\nshe had sailed without him, to make the grand tour of Europe; and\r\nfinally, the stoical philosophy with which he renounced all claim to the\r\nreversionary interest in the one hundred and sixty thousand dollars\r\ntaken from the bank, as well as the net proceeds of Handy Place, and the\r\nrows of buildings, finished and unfinished, in Quodlibet--these\r\nincidents would furnish an episode of tenderness and passion without a\r\nparallel since the Medea of Euripides.\r\n\r\nBut these excursions are foreign from the purpose of this book, and I am\r\nsure would be disallowed by the respectable committee at whose instance\r\nI have entered upon this task. Indeed, they have explicitly enjoined\r\nthat I divulge nothing under their sanction, touching the concerns of\r\nQuodlibet which in any manner borders upon the romantic. Upon these\r\nsubjects their caution is, Nulli tacuisse nocet, tutum silentii praemium.\r\nI must, therefore, reluctantly pretermit all such matter--reserving for\r\nsome other occasion the gratification of the public curiosity therein.\r\n\r\nIn looking back upon the public events of this interval, I deem it\r\nnecessary, in passing, merely to notice the fact that the New Lights\r\nwere greatly rejoiced to find in Mr. Van Buren's message to Congress a\r\ncomplete justification of the Secretary's promise to Mr. Flam, the\r\nimport of which was to assure our representative that the President had\r\nmade up his mind, after the rejection of that measure, to carry the\r\nIndependent Treasury in spite of the people. Our uncompromising,\r\nfearless, and _unshakable_ Quods, true to the dictates of their creed,\r\nwere, I repeat, greatly rejoiced at the manly perseverance and\r\nunquenchable self-will with which the President delivered over that\r\nquestion to the \"Sober Secondthoughts\" (a pest upon the unlucky\r\ncoincidence of that phrase with my patronymic!--it hath given license to\r\nthe tongues of the wags, to my annoyance) of the people. Every good\r\nNew-Light Democrat in the land understood the hint--and a presidential\r\nhint is no small matter to a Democrat now-a-days. Truly delightful was\r\nit to see how it acted upon the New Lights. Not a man among them who had\r\nhitherto halted on a scruple of conscience, but became thereupon, in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, a devoted champion of the Independent Treasury; and\r\nthat, too, without knowing, or caring to know, what it was. It was\r\nhoisted in capitals, at the head of Eliphalet Fox's Weekly, and became\r\nforthwith, as it were, a word written on our banner. We were, one and\r\nall, converted into milites subsignani, and became the Maccabees of this\r\nnew kind of Independent Treasury.\r\n\r\nIt has doubtless often occurred to the reader of this irregular\r\nhistory to inquire how it comes to pass that the historian has ventured\r\nto relate with such composure, nay, with such complacency, what\r\nsuperficial thinkers, at least, might deem to be the _changes_ in the\r\npolitical principles of the New Lights. Superficial is a good word, and\r\ntruly explains the case. Our _principles_, as every one who is gifted\r\nwith sufficient astuteness could not fail to have observed throughout\r\nthis narrative--and as, in fact, we have more than once insinuated--are\r\nmuch deeper than the _measures_ we, from time to time, find it\r\nconvenient to adopt. We hold a change of measures, a change of opinions,\r\na change of doctrine, and even a change of established facts, as\r\nnothing. But a change of men we totally abhor; a change of office,\r\nunless in the way of promotion, we utterly discountenance; and a change\r\nfrom a majority to a minority we execrate as wholly abominable,\r\ndetestable, and in nowise to be endured. Now, in our creed, men,\r\nofficers, and majorities make up the complex idea of what we denominate\r\n_principle_. The whole scope of the New-Light philosophy is, by the\r\nvigor of this thing _principle_, as I have defined it, to keep the Whigs\r\ndown and our modern school of New-Light Democrats up. We proudly appeal\r\nto our past history to sustain our consistency in this pursuit. Let any\r\ndispassionate observer trace our meanderings through the last ten years:\r\nhe will see the efficacy of our system manifested in the wonderful, the\r\nalmost miraculous conversion of Old Blue-Light Federalists, and\r\nFederalists of every hue, into the Born Veterans of Democracy, and in\r\ninvesting these worthy relics of ancient patriotism with the most\r\nprofitable offices in the gift of the government. He will see it in the\r\nmerciless war--bellum ad internecionem--waged by our forces in the name\r\nof the people, against credit, commerce, and industry: he will remark\r\nhow abundantly, and, as it were, by magic, it has fed the nation upon\r\nthe economical, and therefore republican food of promises, relating to a\r\nsound currency--especially those referring to the gold and silver, while\r\nit was stealing along into the cheap and convenient system of a\r\ngovernment paper in the shape of Treasury notes; and he will observe,\r\nwith unfeigned surprise and redoubled admiration, how effectually it has\r\nsecured to us the services and the money of the most opulent individuals\r\nin the land, and of the largest corporations created by the States--in a\r\nmost signal degree those concerned in public works--while it preaches\r\nagainst wealth, chartered privileges and monopolies, and, by its zeal\r\nagainst them, has enlisted almost every penniless man, every wasted\r\nbankrupt, and every cracked reputation in the Union upon our side. But\r\nwe have a still more illustrious exemplification of the practical value\r\nof our philosophy in the address with which affairs are managed by the\r\nhead of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe letter of directions to the Hon. Middleton Flam, with which my\r\nreaders have been favored in a previous chapter, it will be remembered,\r\nrequired the New Lights to support the Independent Treasury, and as\r\nnecessary thereto, to take ground against the State banks, as altogether\r\nunsafe depositories of the public money. It further intimated, supposing\r\nwe might be diffident about this, that the Secretary of the Treasury had\r\nalready furnished evidence of this fact, and would, at the proper time,\r\nmake it manifest that the Government had lost more money by the banks\r\nthan by any other agents it had ever trusted. Our club had never before\r\nbeen aware that the Secretary had reversed his old opinions on this\r\ngrave question, and we, therefore, lost no time in making a call upon\r\nour member for information. Great anxiety was felt to possess the\r\nSecretary's views. A substantial vindication of the Independent Treasury\r\nin this aspect, by the overthrow of the banks on the authority of the\r\nman who had built them up, was a desideratum which we all acknowledged;\r\nand its success we were prepared to regard as the greatest triumph of\r\nthe New-Light principle, to be accomplished through the influence of\r\nthat matchless Secretary, \"whose mind,\" as Theodore Fog once remarked,\r\n\"was endued with a radiating faculty sufficiently intense to light up\r\nthe bottom of a bog, impart a vitreous translucency to the home of the\r\nfrog, and illuminate the abode of the bat with a luster more brilliant\r\nthan that which glittered through the boudoirs of the palace of\r\nAladdin.\" We were aware that in 1834 his duty required him to prove that\r\nthe State banks, while unmolested by the vexatious presence of a bank of\r\nthe United States, were the safest of all possible custodiaries\r\nof the people's money; and that it was the Monster Bank alone\r\nwhich incapacitated them to fulfill their engagements to the\r\nGovernment--thence deducing the fact, that when the monster was dead,\r\nthe public funds could be no otherwise than safe in their keeping. We\r\nwere aware that at that time it was more particularly his duty to praise\r\nthe State banks, because the unprincipled Whigs denied the fact of their\r\nsafety, and opposed the scheme of giving them the public treasure, on\r\nthe very ground that the Government had been a heavy loser by them from\r\nthe period of the war up to the date of the charter of the bank. We had\r\nread carefully his report of the 12th of December in that year, and\r\nremembered these words:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is a remarkable fact connected with this inquiry, though often\r\n     represented otherwise, that not a single selected State bank failed\r\n     between the expiration of the old charter and the grant of the new\r\n     one; and that none of our losses included in our unavailable funds\r\n     happened until some time in 1817, after the United States Bank was\r\n     in operation.\"\r\n\r\nThis, and some other facts culled from the same report, constituted the\r\narmory of weapons by which our club so manfully fought and prostrated\r\nthe croaking and factious Whigs of Quodlibet, when, in their ravings,\r\nthey predicted loss from our employment of the pet banks. But the New\r\nLights being now ordered to take another tack, and being promised a good\r\nfabrication of facts to fortify our position, we rested on our arms like\r\nsoldiers confident in the talents of their general to intrench them in\r\ntheir new camp, secure against every charge of the enemy. Mr. Flam lost\r\nno time in providing us with the Secretary's report of February\r\n27th, 1838. That officer did not deceive our hopes. This luminous\r\npaper carried demonstration on its wings and refutation in its\r\nfootsteps. Prodigious man! Enormous functionary! Brightest of\r\nministers! Samson of the New Lights! Aaron and Moses both in one, of\r\nour Democratic, Quodlibetarian, Golden-calf-worshiping Israelites, (I\r\nspeak symbolically, and not in derogation of the anxiously-looked-for\r\nand long-desired Bentonian coin.) He but touched the rock of New-Light\r\nfaith, and forth gushed the facts like water--yea, and arguments like\r\nmilk and water. With what gratulation did we read,--\r\n\r\n     \"The loss to the Treasury by taking depreciated notes, in 1814,\r\n     '15, '16, and '17, is estimated at quite five millions five hundred\r\n     thousand dollars; and there is now on hand of such notes then\r\n     received and never paid away, or collected, about eighty thousand\r\n     dollars more.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a conclusive argument to all that the Whigs might have urged\r\nin favor of the safety of State banks, if they had thought proper to\r\ndefend them; and, in truth, it was some little mortification to us that\r\nour adversaries did not come out in favor of the banks, when we were so\r\nwell provided with facts to put them down. But they, with that\r\nremarkable obstinacy which has ever characterized them, and which is\r\naltogether behind the age, stuck to their old opinions, and left us\r\nwithout anything to controvert, except, indeed, our own facts of 1834.\r\n\r\nThis instance, however, serves to show with what majestic bounds the\r\nNew Lights have passed over the broad field of measures, and with what\r\nfacile and graceful dexterity they have refuted that antiquated and\r\nvulgar adage which stigmatizes facts as stubborn things. Thus the beauty\r\nof this unrivaled philosophy consists in the harmony with which it\r\nreconciles past times with the present, with which it dovetails\r\ndiscordant principles, with which it brings into brotherhood elements\r\nthe most repulsive, facts the most antagonistical, men the most variant,\r\nand contingencies the most impossible; which converts every man\r\ninto a Janus, every highway into a labyrinth, every beacon into a\r\nlighthouse--giving to falsehood the value of truth, to shadow the\r\nusefulness of substance, and to concealment the estimation of candor.\r\nTruly is it the great discovery of modern times! My reader, I trust,\r\nwill not, now that I have opened his understanding to the perception of\r\nthis sublime spell-working philosophy, allow himself henceforth to\r\nquestion the laudable sentiment of approbation with which I have\r\ndeveloped the practical operation of this theory in the history of\r\nQuodlibet.\r\n\r\nThere was another matter worthy of remark in the events of the year,\r\nwhich I must cursorily notice before I proceed to the era with which I\r\npropose presently to occupy my readers. The Presidential election was\r\nnow in view, and received that grave consideration from the members of\r\nCongress which they are in the habit of giving to everything in\r\nWashington except the trifling business of making laws. Our diligent and\r\nwatchful representative, some time before the close of the short\r\nsession, wrote to our club a letter full of important advice for our\r\nguidance in the affairs of the approaching canvass for the Presidency.\r\n\r\nAmong other valuable disclosures, \"the Whigs,\" said he, \"are to hold a\r\nConvention at Harrisburg. Harry Clay, or, as they term him, Harry of the\r\nWest, is to be their man;--at least, so we suspect. Whoever he be, we\r\nhave made up our minds as to our course--_he is to be run down in the\r\nSouth as an Abolitionist_. Abolition is the best hobby we have had since\r\nthe death of the Monster. We have already broken ground; and if Kendall\r\nand Blair can't prove Clay or anybody else to be an abolitionist, the\r\ndeuce is in it: their right hand will have forgotten its cunning. The\r\nGlobe is full of the matter already. Tell Eliphalet Fox to begin at once\r\nand bark in the same key:--all the little dogs are expected to yelp\r\nafter the old hound--or, as Pickens calls him, the Galvanized Corpse:\r\nmany of them are at it lustily now. In 1836, Van's principles were\r\nluckily Northern;--so we have resolved to let them have full swing\r\nbeyond the Potomac, and to put him in masquerade for the South. We rely\r\nimplicitly on the stolidity of Pennsylvania; and shall secure New York\r\nby a concession to her banks, which for the time we mean to treat\r\namiably. Our chief aim is the South. Van, being thoroughly imbued with\r\nthe New-Light Quodlibetarian Democracy, has consented, for the benefit\r\nof our cause south of Potomac, to be dubbed 'The Northern man with\r\nSouthern principles'--remember that, and tell Fox to ring the changes on\r\nit in every paper. We have hired a New Hampshire man to play clown\r\nto Van; and he somersets when his master does. This has a most\r\nstriking effect. We call him the mannikin of the North with Southern\r\nprinciples--Van's mignonette. Our contract required him to bring in the\r\nanti-abolition resolutions touching the petitions; and although he could\r\nnot venture against _the reception_, he has bolted down all the rest,\r\n_totidem verbis et syllabis_, as we wrote them for him;--_the reception_\r\nwe struck out to accommodate the Democratic abolitionism of his\r\ndistrict. The effect of this coup d'etat was magical; and having gagged\r\nWise and the rest of the Whigs with the Previous Question, we have left\r\nthem in a state of unnatural retention which threatens to prove fatal.\r\nIt is universally considered here a most lucky hit--Van and the\r\nMannikin; and we shall, with these performers, play 'The Northern man\r\nwith Southern Principles,' to crowded houses. Keep it going!--and don't\r\nforget, Clay is an Abolitionist. If the Harrisburg convention nominates\r\nanybody else--the same paragraphs will suit _him_;--Mutato nomine de te\r\nfabula narretur. Get the Secretary to translate that. Be discreet, and\r\nshow this letter only to the faithful.\"\r\n\r\nIt may readily be imagined that our club was thrown into ecstacy by this\r\nconfidential missive. Being the custodiary of the letter, I have\r\nventured, without the permission of the club, to incorporate it in these\r\nannals; taking upon myself the risk of their displeasure rather\r\nthan withhold so fine a specimen of the New-Light Quodlibetarian\r\nDemocracy;--and indeed I can see no reason why the world shouldn't have\r\nit. We have no secrets among the New Lights.\r\n\r\nI proceed now to the Fourth Era in these annals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n  FOURTH ERA--THE HON. MIDDLETON FLAM RE-ELECTED--THE NEW LIGHTS\r\n     DETERMINE TO STIGMATIZE THE WHIGS AS FEDERALISTS--MR. FLAM'S\r\n     INSTRUCTIONS IN REGARD TO THE PRESIDENTIAL CANVASS--NOMINATION\r\n     OF HARRISON AND TYLER--COURSE OF THE NEW LIGHTS--FORMATION\r\n     OF THE GRAND CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF UNFLINCHING NEW-LIGHT\r\n     QUODLIBETARIAN DEMOCRATS--ITS PRESIDENT, SECRETARY, AND\r\n     PLACE OF MEETING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1839, the Hon. Middleton Flam was again our candidate\r\nfor Congress. He was opposed by the celebrated John Smith, of Thorough\r\nBlue. This contest was marked by one conspicuous feature: we had\r\ncompletely succeeded in appropriating to our party the name of\r\nDemocrats--at least we had labored very hard to do so;--our next move\r\nwas to get up the old hue and cry of Federalism against the Whigs. This\r\nrequired great boldness; but Middleton Flam entered upon the endeavor\r\nwith the intrepidity of a hero. Eliphalet Fox walked in his footsteps,\r\nand from all quarters, simultaneously, and by a well-managed concert,\r\nthe cry of Federalist was poured forth upon our opponents; and\r\nHenry Clay especially--as we counted on him for the Presidential\r\ncandidate--was proved to be tainted with Federalism beyond all hope of\r\nbleaching it out.\r\n\r\nWe had now two great points settled with reference to the canvass for\r\nthe Presidency: the Whig candidate was to be brought into disgrace,\r\nfirst, as an Abolitionist, and, secondly, as a Federalist. Mr. Flam gave\r\nour club every assurance that these two charges combined would destroy\r\nthe purest man that ever lived; and that it was only necessary to drive\r\nthese spikes with a sledgehammer every day, and the Democracy in the end\r\ncould not fail to believe in the existence and in the enormity of these\r\noffenses, no matter who should be brought out by the Whigs--whether\r\nScott, Clay, Harrison, or Webster.\r\n\r\nBut we had pretty conclusively made up our minds that Clay was to be the\r\nman; and our club in consequence immediately set about procuring the\r\nmaterials for a biography of that statesman, designed to demonstrate\r\nthat he had all his life been a Hartford Conventionist in sentiment, and\r\nan unsparing enemy of Southern institutions. This task was consigned to\r\nEliphalet Fox, who very soon amassed a wonderful amount of matter\r\nexactly to our purpose. In this, Eliphalet gave evidence of his usual\r\nskill; and his facts were so contrived that they might be used with\r\nequal success against either of the four above named, or indeed any one\r\nelse who might be brought forward: but as Eliphalet had a particular\r\nhatred for Mr. Clay, and was more accustomed to defame him than any\r\nother great man in the nation, the compilation was imbued with a spirit\r\nthat would have been much more effective in breaking down Mr. Clay's\r\nreputation than that of either of the others.\r\n\r\nGreat was the sensation produced in Quodlibet, great was our\r\nmortification, and great our surprise upon receiving the news in\r\nDecember from Harrisburg. The convention actually passed by Mr. Clay,\r\npassed by the great claims of Scott and Webster, and brought out\r\nGeneral William Henry Harrison, together with John Tyler for the\r\nVice-Presidency;--thus, by a perversity which, on all important\r\noccasions, distinguishes the Whigs, putting the two old horses of 1836\r\nupon the course.\r\n\r\nMr. Flam was now at Washington. Our club met and immediately opened\r\na correspondence with him for advice. \"Keep your eye on the Globe,\"\r\nwas his first admonition. His second was, \"Open upon Harrison\r\nyour Abolition batteries;--swear that the nomination was procured\r\nby Garrison;--charge Tyler with being a slaveholder, and send that\r\noff to New Hampshire;--prove that Harrison was a stark Federalist\r\nby accepting an ensigncy from the hands of Washington;--but, above\r\nall, turn him into derision for his poverty and plain habits.\"\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful to see the zeal with which Quodlibet set about the\r\ntask assigned to it by its distinguished counselor. Eliphalet Fox, with\r\na degree of magnanimity uncommon in an editor, took the field in behalf\r\nof Mr. Clay. \"That persecuted patriot,\" said he, \"who deserved more of\r\nhis party than any man in the nation, has been treated with absolute\r\ncontempt. It was due to his great claims to offer him the Presidency;\r\nbut the spirit of abolition swayed this factious convention, and Mr.\r\nClay was rejected solely on account of his well-known and deep-rooted\r\nattachment to the slave-holding interests of the South. As to General\r\nHarrison,\" the same article continued, \"his humble station as the clerk\r\nof a county court, his insignificance and poverty, will leave the\r\nDemocrats but little to overcome. Well has an enlightened and patriotic\r\ncontemporary press, a distinguished pillar of the New Lights, remarked,\r\nin reference to the habits of General Harrison's life and the lowness of\r\nhis associations, that two thousand dollars a year, a LOG CABIN, and a\r\nbarrel of HARD CIDER would induce him to resign all claims to the honors\r\nhis inconsiderate friends have proffered him.\"\r\n\r\nThe same paper propounded a series of interrogatories skillfully\r\naddressed to John Tyler, inquiring of him--what number of slaves he\r\nemployed on his plantation, what was the ratio of their increase in each\r\nyear, and how many he had disposed of at various intervals to Southern\r\ntraders:--which interrogatories were admirably drawn up in language so\r\nequivocal in its import as to infer, what it did not directly assert, an\r\nextensive traffic in a commodity which could not but excite great\r\nindignation against him among the large mass of voters of all sides in\r\nthe North.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful are these evidences of the operation of our New-Light\r\nphilosophy! What a master in this science is the unrivaled Eliphalet\r\nFox!\r\n\r\nIt was soon discovered that our club had fallen into a slight mistake\r\ntouching the Log Cabin and Hard Cider, and the charge of poverty brought\r\nagainst General Harrison. The audacious Whigs had even the effrontery to\r\nadopt the LOG CABIN and HARD CIDER as the emblem of their party, and to\r\nask the aid of those whom we had inconsiderately derided for living in\r\nthose humble cabins and using this cheap luxury of cider, to make war\r\nagainst our New-Light Democracy. The Log Cabin instantly became the\r\nrepresentative of a sentiment and a word of power; and, in a perfect\r\ntornado of enthusiasm, was raised in every village, hamlet, and meeting\r\nground in the land.\r\n\r\nTruly did this sudden upraising of the emblem strike dismay into our\r\nranks! Quid consilii capiemus? was our universal question in Quodlibet.\r\nWhat should we do? Recourse was had to Mr. Flam. \"Drop,\" said that\r\nready-witted man in reply, \"the charge of poverty against Harrison: say\r\nhe is rolling in wealth. Bring out your Federalism against him with new\r\nvigor. Call the Log Cabin banner senseless mummery--and declare your\r\ndisgust against it, as lowering the tone of public sentiment and morals.\r\nIf that doesn't do, get some New-Light Democratic preacher to say that\r\nHard Cider produces more intoxication than all the liquors the Democrats\r\never drank: let him rail against Whig meetings as Hard Cider\r\norgies--remember the word;--and if we can only identify the New-Light\r\nDemocracy with Temperance, its twin sister, we shall produce an\r\nunheard-of effect. Meantime, ply the Abolition battery with all possible\r\ndiligence--and vamp up anew that old charge of hiring out criminals to\r\nservice; but be careful to make no mistake--describe it as 'selling poor\r\nwhite men into slavery for debt.' To prove that Harrison is _against_\r\nslavery and at the same time _in favor_ of it, will be a most happy\r\nstroke of our New-Light Quodlibetarian philosophy. Don't fail to do this\r\nwith all possible industry. Tell Eliphalet Fox that the endeavor is\r\nworthy of his genius, and if he ever expects to become a great man, now\r\nis the opportunity presented to him.\"\r\n\r\nThese counsels gave us great encouragement, and we set ourselves to work\r\nin earnest. The New-Light Club was confined in its operations to the\r\nBorough of Quodlibet. Our whole Congressional district, including\r\nThorough Blue, Tumbledown, and Bickerbray, required the supervision of a\r\nbody which might be organized to regulate the affairs of the canvass\r\nwithin that limit. This gave rise to the Central Committee. A convention\r\nwas called to meet in Quodlibet, where every portion of the district\r\nshould be represented. That convention resulted in the appointment of a\r\nCommittee of Twelve of the staunchest and most active of the New Lights.\r\nIt was called \"The Grand Central Committee of Unflinching New-Light\r\nQuodlibetarian Democrats.\" The name was sonorous, euphonious, and, in a\r\ncertain sense, magnificent--but being too long for ordinary use, we\r\nreduced it for working purposes to \"The Great New-Light Democratic\r\nCentral Committee of Quodlibet.\" Eliphalet Fox was made President; and\r\nthe humble author of these chronicles, in consideration of his fidelity\r\nin the discharge of his duty to the New-Light Club, was chosen to be\r\nSecretary also of the committee--an honor which, with due reverence and\r\nthankfulness, he hath assumed.\r\n\r\nFrom the date of its organization, the committee, a majority whereof\r\nare inhabitants of Quodlibet, meet once a week with most commendable\r\npunctuality, and, as we have reason to believe, with signal usefulness\r\nto the glorious cause in which we have embarked. Zachary Younghusband,\r\nwho is a member, gratuitously and generously, out of his mere zeal in\r\nthe cause, proffered the use of his room up stairs above the tin-plate\r\nworkshop, for our sessions--an offer which we were reluctantly obliged\r\nto decline, after one trial, on account of the noise created by the\r\nworkmen below. I mention this praiseworthy offer as due to Zachary, in\r\nfavor of whom the committee passed a vote of thanks. We found a more\r\nquiet place of meeting in the back room of the cabinet store of Isaiah\r\nCrape, the Undertaker, for which we agreed to pay fifty cents a week and\r\nfind our own lights. In this secluded spot much is done to shape and\r\ndirect the destinies of this Great Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n  PROCEEDINGS OF THE GRAND CENTRAL COMMITTEE--VINDICATION OF THE\r\n     SEVERITY PRACTICED AGAINST GENERAL HARRISON--TACTICS OF THE NEW\r\n     LIGHTS--ABOLITIONISM--SELLING WHITE MEN FOR DEBT--HARRISON\r\n     A COWARD--CONSIDERATIONS WHICH LED TO THE NAMING OF THE\r\n     OPPOSITION BRITISH WHIGS--STRATAGEM AGAINST HARRISON, AND\r\n     THE CLAMOR AGAINST HIM FOR NOT ANSWERING--HOPE OF THE NEW\r\n     LIGHTS CONFIRMED BY THE CONNECTICUT, RHODE ISLAND, AND VIRGINIA\r\n     ELECTIONS--BALTIMORE CONVENTION A FAILURE--IMPORTANT LETTER\r\n     FROM MR. FLAM--AMOS KENDALL'S PURPOSE TO RESIGN--EXCITEMENT\r\n     OF COMPOSITION PRESCRIBED BY HIS PHYSICIAN--CENTRAL COMMITTEE\r\n     SANCTION THE COMPILATION OF THESE ANNALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Grand Central Committee having been thus happily organized, devoted\r\nitself with exemplary diligence to the important concerns of the\r\nPresidential election, which, from this time forth, became the\r\nengrossing subject of all men's thoughts. A volume would not suffice to\r\ndevelop the multifarious labors of the committee. I could not in less\r\nspace recount the resolutions, with long argumentative preambles,\r\nlinking by means of Whereases, like rings, whole newspaper loads of\r\nfacts, invented for the purpose;--the addresses, the speeches copied\r\nfrom the Globe, and extracts from private letters--to say nothing of the\r\nparagraphs, the sole offspring of editorial brains, and all the other\r\nmachinery employed by the committee to defame, traduce, and vilify\r\nGeneral Harrison, for the unpardonable sin of being thought by the Whigs\r\na fit man to preside over this vast Republic. It was our duty to render,\r\nif possible, his very name offensive in the nostrils of the people. In\r\nthis endeavor it may easily be imagined that we found abundance to do in\r\nrummaging up old scraps of history, the falsification of public records,\r\nthe oblique interpretation of equivocal laws, and in practicing all the\r\nother customary arts of warfare known to the New-Light tactics.\r\n\r\nAdmirable is that wisdom of the New Democracy which has provided such an\r\nordeal of punishment for the man who, in opposition to their wishes,\r\ndares to make claim to the favor of the people. What better chastisement\r\ncan be inflicted upon such rash aspirant, than this preliminary gauntlet\r\nwhich it is ordained for him to run before he can be made sensible of\r\nthe insolence of his pretensions? Thrice tormented is it his lot to be,\r\nin the fiery furnace of hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness, before\r\nhe shall see the end of his vain probation. As certain tribes of Indians\r\nhave a custom of torturing, to the verge of stoutest human endurance,\r\nthe candidate for the honor of being accounted a Brave; so in imitation\r\nof this commendable usage did we determine, in no less degree, to\r\ntorture the man whom the hardihood of the Whigs had placed before the\r\nnation for the like empty and unavailing honor.\r\n\r\nIt did truly seem to the New Lights no small insolence of those men who\r\ncall themselves Whigs, to propose any individual for the Presidency,\r\nwhile the people were already favored with a chief whose whole life was\r\nlustrous with the radiance of the Quodlibetarian Democracy. The very\r\nidea of a New Light presupposes an innate, inherent, and intuitive\r\nfitness to fill any station of any kind or degree whatever; and here was\r\none distinguished as the very fountain of New-Light principles already\r\nat the head of the nation, dispensing the favors and wielding the power\r\nof his great office to the supreme content of all Quodlibetarians--the\r\nonly persons in this Republic whose interests deserve to be held of any\r\naccount in the concerns of government. Nothing but the rankest faction\r\ncould originate an opposition to his beneficent administration. Acting\r\nupon this conviction, the Central Committee certainly did not spare\r\nGeneral Harrison.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, soon perceived that the General was a little stronger\r\nwith the people than we supposed him to be; and sundry were the changes\r\nto which we were consequently obliged to resort in our mode of attack.\r\nThe _abolitionism_ we never lost sight of: the _selling of white men\r\ninto slavery for debt_ was also a steady topic; and some of the more\r\ningenious of the committee fell upon the device of proving the old\r\nGeneral _a coward_: but our great effort was to convert him and all his\r\nfriends into old Blue-Light _Federalists_. This was always considered\r\nour master-stroke; and I may appeal to all the New-Light papers of this\r\nday for evidence, that in that department of our labors we plied our\r\ntask with an industry that has never been surpassed. The Jersey\r\nelection, also, we turned to great account in Congress, and certainly\r\nblew our trumpet on that question both loud and long. It was a noble\r\nillustration of our zeal for State Rights, which all the world knows is\r\none of the favorite articles in our present faith. With an eye to this\r\nsame question of State Rights, we succeeded in getting up a tolerable\r\ngood commotion in Congress on the subject of State debts; holding it our\r\nduty, as friends of the sovereignty of the States, to do all in our\r\npower to break down their credit, and to warn the world against placing\r\nany confidence in their pledges--although, upon this subject, I am bound\r\nto confess that our success has not answered our expectations.\r\n\r\nThere was one movement upon which our committee placed great reliance.\r\nMr. Van Buren, and indeed the whole New-Light Democracy, had so often\r\nchanged their course upon public measures, as I have already shown, that\r\nthe nation had been by degrees brought into a belief that every public\r\nman was, of necessity, and from the very nature of his organization,\r\nbound to certify, at least once a year, the state of his principles and\r\nthe character of his opinions on all questions of policy whatever. Now\r\nMr. Van Buren, in 1836, came to the Presidency upon a very summary, and\r\nto himself, very comfortable profession of faith. All that he professed\r\nat that time was to follow in the footsteps--which said footsteps had\r\nscope and variation enough to allow him to take any path he thought\r\nproper. General Harrison, in that contest of 1836, did not enjoy this\r\nadvantage, but was compelled to be somewhat specific in the indication\r\nof the grounds upon which his election claimed to be based. He had,\r\nconsequently, not only been very full in this exposition, but had\r\nlikewise referred his interrogators to a vast amount of written and\r\nprinted opinions, which on divers occasions, in the course of his public\r\ncareer, he had found reason to express.\r\n\r\nIn the present canvass it was determined by our committee, and in fact\r\nby our New-Light friends in general, that he should reiterate afresh\r\neverything he had ever said or written on public matters, and that we\r\nshould, by no means, be content with mere references to past\r\ndeclarations. Indeed, it seemed to our New-Light Democracy that,\r\ninasmuch as _our_ President kept no opinions more than three years old,\r\nat the outside, it was impossible that General Harrison could be so\r\nantiquated as to stick to his for a longer term. Confiding in this\r\nimpression, plans were laid by the New Lights to write letters to the\r\nGeneral in the guise of friends, and in case he should refer the\r\nquerists to his former expositions, without full and ample repetition of\r\nall he had said before, to bring a whirlwind of indignant reproof about\r\nhis ears as a man who was afraid to trust the public with his\r\nsentiments. This stratagem succeeded beyond the most sanguine\r\nexpectation of the New Lights. The General was caught in the trap; and\r\nsuch a clamor as was raised has never before been known in any part of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\"He won't answer questions!\" exclaimed the Globe. \"Gracious Heaven! what\r\nan insult to the intelligence of a nation of vigilant, truth-seeking,\r\nanxiously-inquiring freemen! A silent candidate! What contumely to the\r\npeople! What contempt of the fundamental principles of free government!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious Heaven! what contempt of the people!\" re-echoed the Quodlibet\r\nWhole Team.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious Heaven! what contumely!\" shouted the Bickerbray Scrutinizer.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious Heaven!\" etc. etc., ejaculated two thousand patriotic,\r\ndisciplined, footstep-following papers of all dimensions, from six by\r\ntwelve to three feet square, from one end of the Union to the other.\r\nNever was there such a Gracious Heavening carried on in this country!\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this successively came on the Connecticut, Rhode\r\nIsland, and Virginia elections. The results everybody knows. Although\r\nostensibly and to outward appearance against us, we saw in them what our\r\ninfatuated opponents could not see, the certain token of our success. It\r\nwas evident to us, from the returns of these elections, that a great\r\nreaction must occur; and Mr. Doubleday now very sagely remarked, \"that\r\nthere was no longer room to doubt that we should beat the Whigs in the\r\nfall.\" But the Whigs, instead of desponding at these events, began to\r\ntake heart, and straightway set about getting up a Convention in\r\nBaltimore. Well, that convention was held on the Fourth of May. I was\r\npresent, and I pronounce it to have been a _thorough failure_. The Whigs\r\nhave represented that at least twenty thousand persons were assembled on\r\nthat occasion. According to the accurate system of computation adopted\r\nby the New Lights, and which is infallible in regard to the numbers\r\nattending Whig meetings, the whole assemblage, including boys and\r\nblacks, did not quite reach two thousand, and of those a large number\r\nwere New Lights.\r\n\r\nStill it is due to truth that I should say there were some timid men in\r\nour committee who were not altogether satisfied with the appearances of\r\nthe day. We found it difficult to make them comprehend how the late\r\nelections had operated in our favor. Yet it is a fact that we never were\r\nthoroughly convinced of the _certainty_ of our success until we saw the\r\nreturns in these elections. Connecticut and Rhode Island we had before\r\nconsidered doubtful: we now had no doubt. And as to Virginia, we\r\nbecame at once fully persuaded that our success there was actually\r\n\"brilliant:\"--such is the beautiful operation of the New-Light\r\nphilosophy in bringing consolation to its votaries under apparent\r\ndisaster, and suggesting encouragement where others would despond.\r\n\r\nYet it must not be concealed that these incidents produced some slight\r\nsensation in our committee. Mr. Flam wrote from Washington a letter of\r\ngrave reflection. \"Although,\" said he, \"our success in Virginia has\r\ntranscended our expectations, yet we are not quite certain that our\r\n_abolition_ battery has been altogether _very effective_. Indeed, it is\r\nquestioned here whether it would not be as well to abandon it, and even\r\npoint the guns in the opposite direction. _Martin has room enough yet to\r\nturn_--and, as it is rather manifest that Virginia considers our charge\r\nof abolitionism against Harrison a _humbug_, and as the whole South will\r\nprobably fall into the same opinion, (in which, in my judgment, they\r\nwould not be very far wrong,) the propriety of taking the opposite\r\nground is well worthy of consideration. _Van's affinities are with the\r\nNorth_; so that if it can be made clearly to appear to be his interest\r\nto take this backward leap, his _Southern principles_ are not yet more\r\nthan cobwebs in his way. _We must think of this._ In the mean time, it\r\nis the desire of the President and his managing friends here that you\r\nnot only continue to brand the opposition as _Federalists_, but call\r\nthem BRITISH WHIGS. This is rendered necessary by the fact that the\r\nopposition have just discovered that Van Buren voted against Madison and\r\nthe War, and supported Clinton and the Peace party. By anticipating the\r\nground and charging the Whigs as under British influence, we shall take\r\noff the edge of this assault, and avoid the effect of another\r\nreminiscence against the President--I mean his instructions to M'Lane,\r\non the West India Question, which the Whigs impute to him as a truckling\r\nto Great Britain. Besides this, you know, Martin has been very assiduous\r\nof late in courting the good opinion of Victoria--so, by all means,\r\ndrive at THE BRITISH WHIGS! Keep your eye upon Amos Kendall, who has\r\nconsented to act as fugleman. His health is so much shattered by the\r\ndiseases of the Post-office, that he is compelled to retire; and as his\r\nphysician prescribes 'the excitement of composition' as his only cure,\r\nhe is about to devote himself to the Extra Globe, in which sheet he will\r\nbe able to indulge his imagination in the creation of those chaste and\r\nprurient fancies for which he has been remarkable from a child. The pure\r\nand simple inventions of that paper are ass's milk to his wasted\r\nconstitution.\"\r\n\r\nThus admonished, our Central Committee proceeded in their labors with\r\nthe most spirited activity; and it was not long before the whole Union\r\nwas ringing with our charge against the British Whigs.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that I suggested to the committee the\r\npropriety of making this compilation of the Annals of Quodlibet. I\r\nexplained to them how important it was that the world should be made\r\nacquainted with the history and character of that New-Light philosophy\r\nwhich had worked such wonders in our Borough. It was very obvious that\r\neven our friends were not fully aware of the height and the depth of\r\nthis sublime theory, nor of its extreme efficacy in the administration\r\nof the government. It had taken the world by surprise, and had grown up,\r\nin a few years, into a system which no naturalist had yet defined; and\r\nhad assumed an importance in the affairs of this country which few\r\npersons were able fully to appreciate. Impressed with this conviction, I\r\ndisclosed to the committee the purpose which, for some time past, I had\r\nsecretly cherished, of collating from my manuscripts all such\r\nparticulars in the history of Quodlibet as might serve to elucidate this\r\nsubject. The committee knew that my materials were ample; and they had\r\nmore than once been pleased to express their admiration of those poor\r\ntalents which I had oftentimes exhibited in the effusions of my humble\r\npen. The subject was now brought up to the notice of the committee on\r\nthe motion of my friend, Mr. Younghusband, in a resolution too laudatory\r\nfor my modesty to insert in this book. Readily and cheerfully did the\r\ncommittee condescend to assign this task to my endeavors;--confiding the\r\nmatter and the manner thereof to my sole discretion, with the single\r\ninjunction that I should abstain from all such incidents of mere\r\npersonal or private concernment, as might by captious or invidious\r\ncritics be designated as savoring of romance. Faithfully, as in my\r\njudgment, I could, have I obeyed this injunction; and with the frankness\r\nand veracity of one who chronicles for posterity rather than the present\r\ntimes, have I set forth all such matters of fact and comments of opinion\r\nas shall guide my readers to a true knowledge of the doctrine of the\r\nNew-Light Quodlibetarian philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n  DESERVED COMPLIMENT ON MR. VAN BUREN'S EXPLOIT OF THE FLORIDA\r\n     WAR--THE AFFAIR OF THE TRUE GRITS AND SERGEANT TRAP--TRUE\r\n     GRITS SUFFER A DEFEAT--FLAN SUCKER'S OPINION UPON THE\r\n     SUBJECT--HIS ACCOUNT OF AN ACTION AT LAW BETWEEN JOE SNARE\r\n     AND IKE SWINGLETREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust at this period the True Grits once more began to give themselves\r\nairs of importance in Quodlibet. The Tigertail affair had stunned them,\r\nas a blow sometimes torpifies a snake; and like that same snake, which\r\nafter a long period of consequent inactivity wakes up in the possession\r\nof new powers of mischief, so woke up the True Grits.\r\n\r\nThe Florida war, which has been raging on the part of the Indians, and\r\nsimmering on our part, for nearly five years past, is undoubtedly the\r\ngreatest of all Mr. Van Buren's exploits, and that which will be longest\r\nremembered in the history of this energetic President by posterity. It\r\nhas developed the genius of our New-Light Democratic administration in\r\nstronger colors, and speaks more conclusively in favor of the\r\nperseverance and resource of our Great Chief, than any other of the\r\nnumerous brilliant acts whereby he has illustrated the principles of\r\nthat unterrified and unflinching Democracy, to whom fortune and General\r\nJackson in partnership, have intrusted the destinies of this Republic.\r\nThat war was not only the most righteous and unavoidable in its origin,\r\nbut it has also been the most chivalrous in its character, the most\r\neconomical in its management, and is likely to be the most productive in\r\nits results--if it should ever please Bill Jumper, or Sam Jones, or\r\nMicanopy, or their heirs and representatives, to allow it to come to a\r\nconclusion--that has ever been waged between two great nations; and will\r\nunquestionably cover our Commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the\r\nUnited States with as thick a coat of glory as it has already covered\r\nthe bravest and keenest-nosed of our bloodhounds with a coat of\r\nmud:--and that is, perhaps, about as thick a covering as a hero of the\r\nPresident's mould might be supposed able to stagger under, in that long\r\njourney of fame by which he is to march down to after-times.\r\n\r\nAmong other vigorous measures taken in the prosecution of this\r\nstupendous war, was one that produced no small sensation in Quodlibet. A\r\ntall, raw-boned, slender, and very straight figure of a man, of a\r\nsingularly red head and remarkably freckled face--the said figure being\r\ndecked in a suit of army regimentals highly bedizened with worsted lace\r\nand cord, begirt with a huge saber, and wearing a plume three feet\r\nlong--made its appearance recently in the Borough. This personage\r\nrejoiced in the name and title of Sergeant Trap. He was accompanied by a\r\ndrummer four feet six inches high, of a remarkably fierce military\r\naspect; and by a fifer six feet four, quite as remarkable for the\r\nlength of his arms and legs, and the shortness of his sleeves and\r\npantaloons--both inferring, from their general effect upon his exterior,\r\na rustical and imbellicose mode of life which reluctantly accommodated\r\nitself to the military requisitions of his station.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant and drummer were strangers to our folks; but the fifer was\r\nno other than Charley Moggs, long known as the boss loafer of\r\nBickerbray, and who was famed for a _single_ accomplishment--the\r\nperfection with which he executed, upon an octave flute, that difficult\r\nbut favorite piece of music which goes by the name of \"Sugar in a\r\nGourd;\" which accomplishment was the foundation of his present\r\nastonishing promotion under Sergeant Trap, who had come to Quodlibet, in\r\npursuance of orders from Mr. Poinsett, to pick up as many spare heroes\r\nfor the Florida war, as might be found in our environs, willing to dog\r\nthe Indians in company with our gallant blood-hound allies lately\r\narrived from Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant took a small frame house next door to Sim Travers's\r\nRefectory--or rather, as Sim called it, his Drinkery. Here he hung out\r\nthe stars and stripes, by a pole which was secured in the second story\r\nwindow, and from which the flag vibrated in graceful undulations, almost\r\nsweeping the street when the wind lulled, and filling the hearts of Sim\r\nTravers's customers with emotions of martial glory.\r\n\r\nNow, Sergeant Trap had not the good fortune to be a New Light; but,\r\non the contrary, had the misfortune to be perfectly neutral in\r\npolitics--and, coupled with that, the additional misfortune to be\r\nsometimes in want of money. In the course of some two or three weeks\r\nresidence in the Borough, he had contracted a sort of intimacy with\r\nPeter Ounce, the landlord of The Boatman's Hotel at the upper end, and\r\non the opposite side of the Basin. This intimacy mainly grew out of the\r\ncircumstance that Ounce's hotel furnished very pleasant quarters to the\r\nSergeant, and had also contributed some five or six recruits to his\r\nstandard. Peter Ounce, although a Whig, is a kind-hearted, sociable man,\r\nand disposed to make friendships with those about him; and the Sergeant\r\nhaving run up a score at the bar, fell into the relation of a debtor to\r\nPeter, which it was not always convenient for him, at a moment,\r\nto obliterate. Besides this, Sergeant Trap had, once or twice,\r\nborrowed small sums from the landlord, and received from him sundry\r\nmanifestations of good-will, which laid him, in a certain sense, under\r\nobligations to Peter. The result of it all was, that the Sergeant took a\r\ngreat liking to his landlord--and, following the suggestions of that\r\nfeeling, rather encouraged his men, when they had a little money to\r\nspend in slaking their thirst, to throw it in the way of Ounce.\r\n\r\nThis state of things existed for some time before it was brought into\r\npublic observation. Ounce's liquors were good and cheap, the company\r\nabout his hotel was jovial, and Peter himself obliging--in consequence\r\nof all which Sergeant Trap's men went as often to the Boatman's Hotel as\r\nthey did to Sim Travers's Drinkery, which was next door to the\r\nrendezvous. Sim Travers, who always kept a sharp eye to his business,\r\nwas the first to notice the visits of Trap's men to his rival's bar, and\r\nfor some time he bore it with a sulky and uneasy silence. After awhile,\r\nsundry inarticulate murmurs escaped him denoting vexation; and at length\r\nhe openly began to shake his head and talk about _the duty_ of soldiers\r\nand officers _in the employ_ of the Government. \"_We_ work for the\r\nGovernment,\" said he, \"and the Government ought to work for _us_. If\r\npublic money _is_ to be laid out, them that goes through fire and water\r\nhas the best claim. These Whigs are ready enough to touch the cash when\r\nthere's profit to be got; while them that sticks by Government in all\r\ntheir eternal choppings and changings is to be lookers-on. To the\r\nWieters belongs the Spiles; if that ain't a motter, what's the use of\r\nhaving it? Go it full, or give it up--that's what I say.\"\r\n\r\nSim continued to repeat these sentiments for some time, without seeing\r\nthings alter for the better. Peter Ounce still continued to divide the\r\nprofits of the rendezvous with him. At last Sim became violent. \"I'll\r\nmake it a committee matter,\" said be. Thereupon he went immediately to\r\nEliphalet Fox, and opened to him his whole burden of grievances. \"I'll\r\nfix it,\" replied Fox, very much in the tone of a man of business; and\r\nSim went home in excellent spirits.\r\n\r\nThe next Whole Hog had a paragraph touching this subject. \"If,\" said\r\nthat paper, \"there be one principle which has been more sacredly\r\nestablished than any other by that great revolution through which we\r\nhave just conducted the nation, in redeeming it from the oppressions of\r\nMonopolists and Privileged orders, it is the deep and fundamental truth\r\nthat, To those who have won the victory belong its fruits. The Democracy\r\nhave an unalienable and indefeasible right to all emoluments, issues,\r\nand profits accruing from the expenditures of the public money. And,\r\nmoreover, if there be any class of persons who emphatically _belong_ to\r\nthe Government, it is the men who are enlisted for the Florida war. Few\r\nof them are destined ever to return again to the character of citizens:\r\ntheir _lives_ are undoubtedly the property of the administration, as\r\nevery man must see who reflects upon the history of that war. And if\r\ntheir _lives_ are thus devoted to the cause of the administration, much\r\nmore, may it be said, are their _little gains_ to be employed in the\r\nsame cause. Notwithstanding this self-evident truth, we know of men now\r\nin this Borough, wearing the livery of the Government, who do not\r\nscruple to enrich the coffers of the British Whigs with the money\r\nlavished upon them by the bounty of the Government, and which has been\r\nwrung from the sweat of the poor man's brow. We trust we shall be\r\nunderstood, without being more explicit. If this abuse continue after\r\nthis hint, we shall act in a more efficient form:--a word to the wise.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this very significant paragraph, and the fact that the\r\npaper containing it was sent to the rendezvous, and even addressed to\r\nSergeant Trap by name, the practice complained of was in no degree\r\ncorrected. On the contrary, as if from sheer perverseness and contumacy,\r\nthe evil, if anything, was rather increased. Eliphalet Fox waited a few\r\ndays to see how his paragraph worked. Sim Travers came to him with a\r\nface now much more in anger than in grief. \"It doesn't work at all,\"\r\nsaid Eliphalet, adverting to his paragraph, and anticipating Sim's\r\ncomplaint. \"Never mind, my friend,\" continued he, \"this is _my_ quarrel.\r\nGo home: leave all to me!\"\r\n\r\nSim went home, confident that he should have ample redress. \"If I don't\r\nget it,\" said he, as he walked toward the Drinkery, ruminating over his\r\nwrongs, \"blow me if I don't quit the party. I'm not one of them fools to\r\ngo thorough-stitch, and get nothing for it--blow me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see justice done to Sim Travers,\" said Eliphalet Fox, with an\r\natrabilious look, when he was left alone, \"or die in the attempt--blast\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\nAfter this blowing and blasting, Sim went about the Borough telling\r\nevery man of the persecution he was suffering from the Whigs; and\r\nEliphalet Fox went about to get up the old Tigertail Convention and\r\nbring the matter before them.\r\n\r\nThe next evening the convention met, and a Secret Committee was raised\r\nwith instructions to write a _lettre de cachet_ to the President,\r\nexplaining the flagitious conduct of Sergeant Trap, and demanding his\r\nimmediate dismissal from the army. This letter was written by Eliphalet\r\nFox, and was signed by him and William Goodlack, besides Sim Travers and\r\nThomas Crop the constable, which two latter made their mark--these four\r\nbeing the Secret Committee. The letter was duly dispatched to Washington\r\nto be presented by the Hon. Middleton Flam, who was _required_ by the\r\ncommittee to render this service, from a suspicion that at bottom he was\r\nnot very favorable to the True Grits. \"Catch a weasel asleep!\" said our\r\nworthy representative when this letter reached him. \"Gentlemen, I'll do\r\nyour bidding, by all means.\" And so, being wide awake, and fully\r\ndetermined to give the True Grits no cause of complaint against him, he\r\nwent straight with the _lettre de cachet_ to the President. In a few\r\ndays the committee received a letter from Mr. Flam, informing them he\r\nhad done everything they had demanded: that the President had read their\r\nconfidential communication, and without hesitation replied, that if\r\nSergeant Trap had been a _civil_ officer, he would have dismissed him\r\nwithout further inquiry, in deference to the respectability of the\r\ncommittee;--but that, as Sergeant Trap belonged to the _army_, he found\r\nhimself reluctantly compelled to proceed in a more formal manner, and\r\nthat consequently he should direct a Military Court of Inquiry to take\r\ncognizance of the case: that this Court would sit in Quodlibet where the\r\nprosecutors were requested to be ready to prove the enormities alleged\r\nagainst Sergeant Trap.\r\n\r\n\"A Court of Inquiry!\" exclaimed Fox, with great emotion. \"Is the thing\r\nto be made public? We are deceived, betrayed:--I know by whom,\" he\r\nadded, significantly nodding his head.\r\n\r\n\"A Court of Inquiry!--proofs, and all riglar--upon oath?\" exclaimed Sim\r\nTravers.\r\n\r\n\"I'm blest if I go before any court!\" said Tom Crop.\r\n\r\n\"By blazes, I won't!\" said Billy Goodlack. \"There's _something_ in this\r\nhere thing--else why don't the President go smack forward on the\r\nletter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm no prosecutor,\" said Eliphalet Fox.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not a persecutor, nother,\" said Tom Crop. \"By blood! I scorn it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to put my hand on the book, upon it,\" said Sim Travers.\r\n\"If a man can't lodge a complaint without being hauled into court, the\r\nparty's broke: a fig for the money! who cares about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my identical sentiment!\" said Billy Goodlack. \"By blazes, I'm\r\nno prosecutioner!\"\r\n\r\nThe committee was certainly thrown into great consternation. The cause\r\nof this is said to have been that in representing the case of Sergeant\r\nTrap to the President by letter, upon which they expected an immediate\r\norder dismissing the offender from service, they had charged him with a\r\nlong list of misdemeanors against the welfare of the Great New-Light\r\nDemocratic Party; which they knew, in the first place, had no sort of\r\nfoundation in fact, and therefore might be found extremely difficult of\r\nproof; and the attempt to investigate which, in the second place, they\r\nwere aware might bring the True Grits into collision with each other in\r\na manner not very conducive to the harmony of the party. They were,\r\ntherefore, not a little thrown aback when they were apprised of the\r\nPresident's determination to make the charges a subject of inquiry.\r\n\r\nWe cannot sufficiently commend Mr. Van Buren's caution in this matter,\r\nand the sound New-Light Democratic view he took of the subject. Here was\r\na grave charge preferred against one of his own servants, imputing to\r\nhim a disposition to deal with Whigs--nay, an _actual_ dealing with\r\nthem, when there was a New Light to be found in the same town capable of\r\nfurnishing the same commodity. Doubtless, upon this nefarious\r\ntransaction being fully proved, Mr. Van Buren, like a genuine,\r\nunadulterated Quod, as he is, would dismiss the offender from service,\r\nor even inflict on him other punishment, if it fell in his way. But in\r\nso serious a case he was determined not to be premature in his action:\r\nhe would not proceed--unless, indeed, the offender had been a civil\r\nofficer--upon such testimony as the confidential letter of a committee.\r\nHe takes the only just course--(in this I have reason to believe he was\r\nfully seconded, perhaps even prompted, by our sagacious representative,\r\nthe Hon. Middleton Flam)--and that is a formal, solemn, judicial inquiry\r\ninto the conduct of Sergeant Trap, to ascertain whether he _really had_\r\npurchased liquors to the prejudice of the Great New-Light Quodlibetarian\r\nDemocratic Party. Truly have we reason, day by day, to rejoice in a\r\nPresident of such magnanimity, such justice, such innate republicanism,\r\nand withal such dignity!\r\n\r\nThe Court of Inquiry met. It was composed of officers of high rank.\r\nAfter a long and patient investigation, and the most accurate\r\nascertainment of the number of gills of rum, whisky, and brandy sold to\r\nTrap's recruits by Sim Travers, and by Peter Ounce, and a careful\r\narithmetical computation of the value thereof in money; and, after a\r\nlaborious examination into Sim Travers's politics, as also into those of\r\nPeter Ounce, the trial resulted in the conclusion that Sim Travers was\r\nnot so good a New Light as he professed to be, (this was founded on\r\nevidence that Sim had said \"he would leave the party if he couldn't get\r\nhis share of spiles,\") and that Peter Ounce's politics were, in fact,\r\nnot known to Sergeant Trap at the time he dealt with him: whereupon Trap\r\nwas acquitted of each and every charge brought against him; although\r\nTheodore Fog, the Counsel for the Secret Committee, took upon himself to\r\ninform the Sergeant, somewhat authoritatively, that as he was now aware\r\nof the dangerous tendency of Ounce's principles, the President would\r\nexpect him to close all accounts at the said Peter's bar, and to be more\r\ncircumspect the next time.\r\n\r\nIt was generally admitted, and indeed was the common talk of the\r\nBorough, that in this notable trial Eliphalet Fox dodged, that Billy\r\nGoodlack dodged, that Sim Travers dodged, and that Tom Crop actually\r\nskulked. And the general effect of the whole was to cut the combs of the\r\nTrue Grits so thoroughly, that it is believed they will never rise\r\nagain. Flan Sucker made a jest of this, very much to the annoyance of\r\nhis friends--for Flan had taken a violent fancy to Sergeant Trap, and\r\neven at one time, it was supposed, had an idea of enlisting. He used to\r\nsit up with the Sergeant of nights and drink a good deal with him\r\nthrough the day, and by this means very naturally became quite a crony.\r\nHe therefore exulted much more than a True Grit, it was conceived,\r\nought, at the Sergeant's triumphant acquittal. \"Sargeant Trap,\" said he,\r\n\"Locumsgillied Liphlet Fox;\" and as this expression requires an\r\nexplanation, he gave it, to this effect.\r\n\r\n\"Joe Snare, the bailiff over here in Tumbledown, fotch a suit before\r\nSquire Honeywell, agin Ike Swingletree for twenty-five dollars, on a\r\ncart which Joe sold him. Joe drawed up a note of hand for Ike to sign,\r\nwhich Ike did; and Ike never thought no more about it. Joe kept askin'\r\nfor his money, year after year, year after year, tell at last he got\r\ntired, and so fotch the suit. Ike found out at the trial that the Squire\r\nwas goin' to give judgment agin him; so what does he do but sashrary the\r\ncase!--whereby the case was tuck up to the Court. Well, when they came\r\non to trial there, Ike had a lawyer who found out that the note of hand\r\nwas more than three years old, and there hadn't been no promise to pay\r\nin the mean time. Thereupon the Court told Joe Snare, if he hadn't\r\nnothing to say agin' it, they must give judgment for Ike on the Statute\r\nof Lamentations. Is it that, your honor? said Snare--for Joe being\r\nbailiff was pretty well up to law, and pled his own cause;--well, may it\r\nplease your honor, maybe the statue is agin me, but, your honor, I\r\ndrawed up the note of hand myself, and if you'll just be so kind to look\r\nin the corner under the dog's-ear, you'll see two letters at the eend of\r\nIke Swingletree's name tantamount to L. S., which, as I understand, your\r\nhonor, goes for _Locumsgilly_--whereby it takes twelve years, if I'm not\r\nmistaken, to kill the note of hand, bekase that's a bond. The judge\r\nlooked and looked, and then sot up a laugh; and Ike Swingletree began to\r\nturn a little pale. Joe, says the judge, you're right, says he: that\r\nalters the case, and you must have the judgment. Joe, says he, you have\r\nbeaten the lawyer and his client both--you're a clever fellow, and will\r\nget your money. So Joe accordingly got the judgment, and came off\r\nmightily pleased. And when he was tellin' me about the matter next day,\r\nhe burst out in a great haw-haw, and couldn't hardly talk for laughing:\r\nIke Swingletree, said he, sashraried _me_, but I reckon I Locumsgillied\r\n_him_.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's just what Sergeant Trap has done to Liphlet\r\nFox--LOCUMSGILLIED him beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n  THESE CHRONICLES DRAW TO A CLOSE--THE NEW LIGHTS NOT\r\n     DISPLEASED WITH ELIPHALET FOX'S DISCOMFITURE--PASSAGE OF\r\n     THE INDEPENDENT TREASURY BILL, AND REJOICING THEREON IN\r\n     QUODLIBET--CHANGES--INTERESTING LETTER FROM THE DIBBLE\r\n     FAMILY--MR.

MIDDLETON FLAM--DEFECTION OF FOG AND SUNDRY TRUE\r\n     GRITS--SECOND SPLIT--GREAT UPROAR AND CONFUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy patient and indulgent reader will doubtless agree with me that it is\r\ntime these gossiping chronicles were brought to a close. Indeed, I am so\r\nnear upon the heels of the day in which I write, and the printer so near\r\nupon mine, that little remains to be said. I shall therefore dispatch\r\nwhat remains of my memoranda with such speed as shall suit my reader's\r\nlonging for the end.\r\n\r\nAlthough the New Lights in general bore no ill-will against that\r\ndivision or faction which has been distinguished in these pages by the\r\nname of True Grits, yet I must say we were not wholly displeased at the\r\nresult of Serjeant Trap's trial. On the contrary, many of us chuckled in\r\nsecret thereat. Eliphalet Fox we have ever acknowledged to be a useful\r\nman and a zealous--and we have not been backward to award him such meed\r\nas he deserved. But it must be told that in Eliphalet there lurks a\r\nscantling of ambition to climb higher on the ladder than our party is\r\nyet willing to afford to one of his degree. And Eliphalet moreover is\r\nsuspected--Heaven forfend that I should do him wrong!--in regard to the\r\nHon. Middleton Flam our representative, and those who are not altogether\r\nwell disposed toward him, I mean Theodore Fog's adherents, (for it is\r\nmanifest Theodore is looking to a seat in Congress,) utrosque parietes\r\nlinere, as the Latin proverb has it, which in the vernacular signifies\r\nto wear two faces--by no means an uncommon, though a very objectionable\r\nsin in political affairs. This may be a groundless suspicion, as I would\r\nfain hope it is; but it is believed by many, and therefore the more\r\nreason was there for some secret rejoicing in Quodlibet at Eliphalet's\r\nfailure in the matter of Sim Travers. It unquestionably hath made our\r\neditor of the Whole Hog more modest and seemly in his behavior of late.\r\n\r\nThe course of the canvass has been growing every day more and more\r\nintensely interesting to our New Lights; and, bating some few\r\naberrations into which we have fallen, daily gives us greater promise of\r\nthe consummation of all our wishes. The passage of the Independent\r\nTreasury bill has brought us fresh occasion of rejoicing and confidence.\r\nAfter a long, and, as Tom Crop says, a bloody struggle, lo! it is at\r\nlast the law of the land, and all our wishes are crowned. \"It is,\" as\r\nMr. Flam has declared, \"the unmingled, unaided, spontaneous result of\r\npopular sagacity--springing not from executive dictation, nor the\r\ninfluence of party discipline, but from the intuitive and instinctive\r\nwisdom of millions of freemen ground to the dust by the tyrannical\r\npressure of associated wealth. It is the law of the land in spite of the\r\ngroans of merchants, the wailings of agriculturists, and the murmurs of\r\nmechanics. It seals the fortune of our great chief, and proclaims the\r\nimmortal triumph of the New-Light Democracy.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the tidings of this joyful event reached us in Quodlibet, our first\r\ncare was to fire one hundred guns; the next was to illuminate the\r\nBorough, and to bring out all our flags and lanterns; after this the New\r\nLights were called together in the Court-House, where addresses were\r\ndelivered by Agamemnon Flag and Theodore Fog--the latter of whom\r\nactually outdid himself in an effort that would have exalted the fame of\r\nPatrick Henry; and to close this jubilee, the Central Committee passed a\r\nresolution declaring the bill the Second Declaration of Independence.\r\nFor this brilliant series of events we have to thank that sturdy\r\ndevotion to State Rights which shone with such conspicuous luster in the\r\nannihilation of New Jersey by the New Lights, in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. But for that glorious stroke of policy the bill would\r\nagain have been crushed by the serpent of opposition. Now that we have\r\ngained it, British Federal Whiggery is forever prostrate.\r\n\r\nA fortnight after this event brought us the cheering tidings from\r\nLouisiana, to which many an anxious eye had been turned. The elections\r\nthere have resulted in a splendid victory--a victory, indeed, not\r\nindicated by the polls, where the majority was _seemingly_ increased\r\nagainst us--but manifested in the spirit with which our people\r\neverywhere received the tidings. Until this spirit became manifest, it\r\nmight be said our hopes were even wavering; but forthwith an unwonted\r\nconfidence in our success has spread abroad. The sagacious Mr.\r\nDoubleday, whose face may be called the barometer of our party, and to\r\nwhom we all look for predictions of the future, now wears a countenance\r\nwreathed in smiles, and tells us that, from what he knows of the\r\nchangeableness of that State, \"we may make ourselves altogether certain\r\nof the victory in the fall.\"\r\n\r\nIn running over the events of the day, nothing is more deserving of our\r\nanimadversion than the ostentatious display, by the British Federal Tory\r\nWhigs, of the _changes_ among the people against the New-Light\r\nDemocracy;--as if here and there the change of some recreant Democrat,\r\nwho is afraid to follow his leader and chooses to have opinions of his\r\nown, could stay the mighty torrent of attachment to the fortunes of our\r\nchief. We do not deny these changes; but rather rejoice that men, so\r\nlittle worthy of being called true Quods, should leave our standard to\r\nthe tried soldiers who have marched behind it in all its vicissitudes,\r\nand fought its battles through the whole field of political experiment.\r\nBy such only can our glorious cause be upheld. But we can recount\r\nchanges as well as they.\r\n\r\nI might select thousands from our newspapers; and I forbear to do so\r\nonly because I think it unworthy of the good sense of a Quod to parade\r\nthe names of converts to our party; thus assimilating, as it were, the\r\npeople to a flock of sheep, and expecting that more will follow because\r\nmany have gone before.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one case which I am sure I shall be excused for\r\nbringing before my reader. It is that of the Dibble family of Wisconsin.\r\nIt was brought to the notice of our Central Committee by Zachary\r\nYounghusband, who came into possession of the original manuscript\r\nthrough a brother Postmaster, Mr. Straddle, who resides in the\r\nneighborhood of the converted family, and who, in fact, was the\r\namanuensis used upon the occasion. Our committee thought this document\r\nof sufficient importance to be copied into the Whole Hog; from whence it\r\nis likely to be transferred into every New-Light Democratic paper of the\r\ncountry. It certainly exhibits very conclusive as well as very abundant\r\nreasons for change; and may be said to contain the best epitome of the\r\npopular objections of the New Lights to the election of General Harrison\r\nwhich has yet appeared in print. An aged and widowed father with five\r\nsons--all heretofore steeped to the lips in the slough of British\r\nWhiggery--have had the independence to rise, in the majesty of\r\nfreemen, and boldly assert the highest prerogative of an American\r\ncitizen--the right of thinking, speaking, and voting in such\r\nmanner as a patriotic, disinterested New-Light Postmaster, whose\r\nopinions are above all suspicion, might direct them. The letter of\r\nthis never-sufficiently-to-be-admired family will speak for itself. I\r\nhave only to remark that, in transcribing it, I have taken the liberty\r\nto correct, what indeed I must call, some glaring faults in the\r\northography--which are to be attributed solely to Mr. Straddle, the\r\nPostmaster, who reduced the instrument to writing, and who, by-the-by,\r\nlet me say, should be advised to give more of his attention to the\r\nuseful art of spelling--but in no other point altering word, syllable,\r\nor letter.\r\n\r\nIt it is somewhat fancifully headed\r\n\r\n     \"GO IT, YE CRIPPLES!\r\n\r\n     \"This is to give notice, that we who have put our sign-manuals to\r\n     the foot thereof, being till now snorting Whigs, having heard our\r\n     Postmaster, Clem Straddle, Esq., say that he knows General Harrison\r\n     sold five white men as slaves off his plantation, and _is_ for\r\n     abolition, and whipped four naked women on their bare backs, and\r\n     _is_ for imprisonment for debt, and moreover _is_ for making a\r\n     King, and goes for raising the expenses of the Government up to\r\n     fifteen millions, and _is_ a coward and wears petticoats, and _is_\r\n     kept in a cage, and wants to reduce wages, and for that purpose is\r\n     a going to have a standing army of two hundred thousand men, which\r\n     our free and independent spirits won't bear, and wants to give the\r\n     public money, which comes from the sweat of our brows, and public\r\n     lands, to Sam Swartout and Price, and a gang of British Whigs,\r\n     which we consider against the Constitution, and moreover we don't\r\n     believe he won't answer, and has got no principles excepting them\r\n     what he used to have, and is against the Independent Treasury which\r\n     was signed Fourth of July, whereby it is the Declaration of\r\n     Independence; and the aforesaid Clem Straddle, Esq., which writeth\r\n     this for us and in our names, being against all office-holders\r\n     which the British Whigs is a striving after, and tells us to vote\r\n     for Van Buren, we being an affectionate father and five orphan\r\n     children without any mother, and never had any since infancy, make\r\n     known that in the next Presidential election in this Territory, if\r\n     we had a vote, and if not we shall vote in Missouri, we goes\r\n     against Tip. and Ty. and all that disgusting mummery of Log Cabins,\r\n     Hard Cider, Coonskins, Possums, and Gourds, in regard of their\r\n     lowering morals, and goes for Jackson, Hickory Poles, Whole Hogs,\r\n     and Van Buren, as witness our hands and seals.\r\n\r\n\r\n            his\r\n     MALACHI + DIBBLE, Parent.\r\n            mark.\r\n\r\n               his\r\n     WASHINGTON + DIBBLE.\r\n               mark.\r\n\r\n              his\r\n     JEFFERSON + DIBBLE.\r\n              mark.\r\n\r\n     MADISON DIBBLE.\r\n     FAYETTE DIBBLE.\r\n\r\n                     his\r\n     SQUINTUS CURTIUS + DIBBLE.\r\n                     mark.\r\n\r\n     \"_Note._--Washington and Jefferson is voters, Madison and Fayette\r\n     is at school, and signs for themselves, and Squintus Curtius is\r\n     rising nine.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter, it will be admitted by all unprejudiced persons, bears the\r\nmost expressive testimony to the natural and unsophisticated character\r\nof its authors; and furnishes us gratifying evidence that the great\r\nReform, which it has been the labor of our committee to promote, has\r\nbegun at the right end, and that the result must be the infallible and\r\nuniversal triumph of New-Light Democracy over the whole Union.\r\n\r\nUpon the adjournment of Congress, late in July, the Hon. Middleton Flam\r\nreturned to Quodlibet, to infuse new energy into our indefatigable\r\ncommittee. Through him we were apprised of many matters of deep interest\r\ntouching the progress of the Campaign, which was now growing amazingly\r\nactive. Being in the confidence of the President and Amos Kendall, he\r\ncould tell us divers things which were not intrusted to the party at\r\nlarge; and let us into the secrets of the little and big wheels which\r\nwere at work in Washington and other places.\r\n\r\nThese communications were generally of a character to increase the\r\nalready sufficient confidence of the party in the re-election of the\r\nPresident, and still more, if possible, endear him to the multitudinous\r\nfriends who expected, in that event, to receive the long-sought and\r\nwell-earned rewards due to their personal devotion to his cause. Mr.\r\nFlam had surveyed the whole field of contest, and had arrived at an\r\naccuracy of information in regard to the vote of each State--and,\r\nindeed, of almost every county in the Union--that, to the unstudied in\r\nsuch matters, would appear to be miraculous--very little short of the\r\ngift of prophecy. It is astonishing to see what proficiency an old and\r\npracticed politician arrives at in predicting, months beforehand, the\r\nprecise majorities of the Democratic party over all other parties, in\r\nevery election, and especially in settling the result of a Presidential\r\nelection. Our sagacious member on this occasion assured us, greatly to\r\nour exhilaration, that we should see, in the Western and Southern State\r\nelections which were about to take place, a most triumphant vindication\r\nof the administration, as well as a most conclusive evidence of the hold\r\nwhich the President has gained upon the affections of the people.\r\n\"Indiana,\" he said, \"is undoubtedly with us by an overwhelming majority;\r\nKentucky is redeemed, regenerated, and disenthralled, beyond a shadow of\r\ndoubt--(a favorite oratorical expression of his;) and North Carolina is\r\nprepared to hurl the thunderbolts of her contemptuous scorn against\r\nBritish Whiggery, with the red right hand of an offended Jove. Depend\r\nupon what I tell you, gentlemen. I have carefully surveyed the field. I\r\nam not accustomed to speak without knowledge. I am never mistaken.\"\r\n\r\nAssured and invigorated by these encouraging words, we accordingly wait\r\nwith cheerful trust in the coming event.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome nervous New Lights affect to see signs of alarm in the unwonted\r\ndisquietude of the President. Rumors reach us that he does not sleep\r\nwell; that he writes many letters, slightly variant in sentiment, to\r\nopposite sections of the Union; that he manifests symptoms of an\r\nover-excited zeal to demonstrate the exceedingly prosperous condition of\r\nthe party. Besides this, the Vice-President, it is said, thinks it his\r\nduty \"to take the stump,\" which is considered rather an ominous\r\ndeparture from \"the usages of the Democratic party,\" and, in fact, is\r\nlooked upon as a proof that our leaders are growing a little\r\nfaint-hearted. But what can be more consistent with the principles and\r\nprofessions of the New-Light creed? Have we not exploded Mr. Jefferson's\r\nold and unprofitable notion, that the office-holders ought not to\r\ninterfere with the freedom of the elective franchise? Is it not a\r\nfundamental point in our philosophy that the offices are \"the spoils,\"\r\nand that the men who hold them owe it to themselves and their posterity\r\nto fight for them in every way known to Democratic warfare?--How\r\nappropriate then is it that our highest and greatest officers, having\r\nthe largest stake, should be in the very front of the battle! Is it not\r\nespecially incumbent on the President, being the illustrious head of the\r\nunterrified new Democracy, to show a laudable anxiety for the issues of\r\nthe campaign, to write letters suited to every emergency, to rectify\r\nconstitutional mistakes, and to mystify every unpleasant fact that might\r\nhave a tendency to divide the party or discourage its hopes? If he did\r\nnot diligently devote himself to such work he would not be worthy of\r\nthat high place we have assigned him in the Quodlibetarian school.\r\n\r\nMr. Flam, moreover, assures us that the President has a profound faith\r\nin \"the intelligence and firmness of the people,\" and is unwearied in\r\nhis endeavors to make that clear to the most careless or indifferent\r\nobserver. Mr. Flam himself urges it upon the Club as highly important;\r\nthat we should give great prominence to this idea of an absolute belief\r\nin the intelligence of the people. He reminds us, that it is a cardinal\r\nmaxim in the tactics of the New Lights, when a politician or a party is\r\nsuspected of any unwholsome opinion, to repel the effect of this\r\nsuspicion by frequent affirmation and repetition of words and sentiments\r\nwhich in the popular judgment shall be held to contradict it.\r\n\r\nAnother card in the game our member recommends on the same august\r\nauthority: that is, to dwell persistently upon the _Federalism_ of our\r\nopponents, and to speak of it, on all occasions, as a term of \"ignominy\r\nand insult,\" by which, he says, many virtuous and innocent-minded\r\nDemocrats may be beguiled into the belief that none of our chief and\r\nmost authoritative leaders ever belonged to that venerable party which\r\nonce gloried in the name of Federalists.\r\n\r\nThese and many other valuable suggestions were communicated by our\r\nHonorable Representative to the Club, as matters of moment in the\r\nconduct of our affairs.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful to contemplate the influence of these master-minds upon\r\nour Quodlibetarian friends. The President scarcely drops a sentiment\r\nfrom his pen before it becomes as it were expanded into the common air\r\nof Democracy. The Globe usually leads off: the Whole Hog follows; and\r\nupon their heels the Scrutinizer, with all the rank and file of\r\ntypographs, brings up a glorious chorus of repetition which leaves no\r\nhill or valley, mountain or plain in the whole land uninstructed in the\r\nPresidential utterances. Thus is it, even now, with this tribute to the\r\n_intelligence_ and _firmness_ of the people, and this stigma of\r\n_ignominy_ and _insult_ upon the old Federalists.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Middleton Flam, Theodore Fog, Agamemnon Flag, and Zachary\r\nYounghusband, (for Zachary has turned orator of late,) and, without\r\nvaunting, I myself may say that the importance of the crisis has even,\r\non same recent occasions, placed me in the same category--we all give\r\nbreath to the same sentiment in speeches by day and by night, and \"the\r\nsame keynote,\" to quote a studied and prepared figure of speech from an\r\nadmirable oration delivered last week by Agamemnon Flag in front of the\r\nIron Railing--\"The same key note of the _Intelligence of the People_\r\nrings in the discourses of five thousand Orators, and jangles in twenty\r\nthousand resolutions of New-Light Democratic Clubs from the St. Croix to\r\nthe Sabine; and through all the windings of its devious way the\r\n_Ignominy and the Insult of Federalism_ murmur on the ear in inseparable\r\ntreble accompaniment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nWe have just received in Quodlibet the news from Kentucky, Indiana, and\r\nNorth Carolina. We are lost in amazement! Our cause is no longer in\r\ndoubt. Whatever misgivings we may have heretofore entertained, all have\r\nvanished. The majorities Mr. Doubleday accounts for in the most\r\nsatisfactory manner,--and though ostensibly on the side of the British\r\nWhigs, they have yet been obtained in such a manner as to render us\r\nperfectly certain of success \"in the Fall.\"\r\n\r\nNim Porter offers an even bet of one thousand dollars on the result, and\r\nis willing to increase it to ten.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND POSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nAlabama, Illinois, and Missouri, are _in_, at the office of the Whole\r\nHog. Eliphalet Fox is stark mad with delirious joy. To outward\r\nappearance something is gained by the enemy; but Mr. Doubleday says it\r\nis altogether illusory, and that, in fact, he has never been truly\r\nconfident until now. He repeats his assurance, that we must, from the\r\nsigns, inevitably carry all before us \"in the Fall.\"\r\n\r\nNim Porter is willing to double his bets.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD POSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n_Longo Intervallo._\r\n\r\nThe great election is over. Harrison is elected!!!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI can write no more at present. I crave time to compose myself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTEN AT NIGHT.--The Club is in session. How blank, dreary, and long\r\nvisaged!\r\n\r\nWe all feel the calamity, but say little.\r\n\r\nMr. Snuffers is terribly exercised. He thinks the catastrophe\r\nis to be attributed to that unhappy split of the party on the Iron\r\nRailing:--blames Theodore Fog for pressing that point too hard on Ag\r\nFlag and his friends.\r\n\r\nTheodore Fog is greatly exasperated at this remark, and threatens to\r\nmake a speech next week to explain his views: says he has known all\r\nalong that Harrison would be elected,--adding, to the consternation of\r\nevery one,--\"AS HE DESERVED TO BE!\" He affirms angrily, \"no party could\r\nget on with that ABSURD(!) Two-Third's Rule, which,\" he says, \"is a\r\nflagrant abnegation, repudiation, and fundamental and atrocious\r\nviolation of the old, ancient, and veteran usages of the Democratic\r\nparty.\" He adds, with extraordinary bitterness of expression and\r\nviolence of gesticulation, pointing his finger at the Hon. Middleton\r\nFlam, who had just entered the club-room, \"I can name the wr-r-retched\r\nintriguer who got it up. As Nathan said unto David--Thou art the man!\"\r\n\r\nGreat confusion in the Club. Mr. Flam grows red in the face. Several\r\nmembers start from their seats. Mr. Flam shakes his fist at Theodore\r\nFog, and calls him AN ABOLITIONIST! He would have uttered other\r\nepithets, but Mr. Doubleday catches him in his arms and holds his hand\r\nclose over Mr. F.'s mouth. Fog fiercely retorts on Mr. Flam, and\r\nvociferates in the rudest tone--\"FEDERALIST!\"--He jerks off his cravat\r\nin a highly exasperated manner, evidently threatening a personal\r\nassault. Nim Porter seizes him by the shoulders, and whirls him into a\r\ncorner, ejaculating, \"The., don't make a fool of yourself!\"\r\n\r\nThe uproar is at its height, when Thomas G. Winkelman, with great\r\npresence of mind, blows out the lights. The consequence is, an abrupt\r\nadjournment and a hurried and excited departure of the members from the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nNEXT MORNING.--All Quodlibet is in a state of unparalleled disorder. It\r\nis reported that Theodore Fog has gone over to Harrison. Many True Grits\r\nhave taken the same path.\r\n\r\nThis is the second great Split of the Democratic party. The Hon.\r\nMiddleton Flam says it cannot possibly stand a third.\r\n\r\nQuis, talia fando, temperet a lachrymis!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENTLE reader, I have performed my covenant. Quod meum fuit praestiti.\r\nWhat content these chronicles, and the poor skill with which they are\r\nset forth, may have brought to our respectable committee, I am in no\r\nposition to decide; since I know that an author is seldom honestly\r\ncommended to his face. That there is division of opinion on this matter\r\nI am aware; for upon the reading at the last meeting on Wednesday night,\r\nI could not fail to observe certain signs of dissent, if not of\r\ndispleasure, passing between Eliphalet Fox and Zachary Younghusband; and\r\n_that_ more than once. But Mr. Flam, who has always shown himself a true\r\nfriend and patron to me, took up my cause with such spirit and effect,\r\nbeing well supported by Mr. Doubleday and Mr. Snuffers, that a unanimous\r\nvote of approbation was finally passed by the committee. Thus sheltered\r\nunder the shield of triple brass and tough bull hide of our Grand\r\nCentral Committee, I cheerfully submit my labors to the judgment of the\r\ngood folks of Quodlibet; promising, if they approve and should again\r\ncall me to the desk, to contribute what my opportunity may allow to the\r\nbetter elucidation of their character, both social and public, wherein\r\nit is manifest an eager desire to be instructed hath lately grown up in\r\nthis nation.
