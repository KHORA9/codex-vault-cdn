In humble Sofia, where there\r\nis little pretence, the judge of a supreme court, whose salary was\r\n72_l._ a year, declined an offer of double that wage to serve me as\r\ninterpreter. An officer in the army, and other Government officials to\r\nwhom I made approaches, displayed similar pride and lack of enterprise.\r\nI was bound for the border, and the only individuals willing to\r\naccompany me were two fallen stars of feeble age, in circumstances of\r\ndespair; and at last I was obliged to choose between these luckless\r\nlinguists. One was an anarchist, light of head and heavy of heart, the\r\nother a bankrupt viscount with a bad eye. I selected the nobleman, but\r\na word for the anarchist; he is dead.\r\n\r\nHe was a very dirty anarchist, with long, shaggy, unkempt mane, and\r\na hungry, haunted look. He wore a silk-lined frock coat of ample\r\ncapacity, a pair of trousers of doubtful suspension, shoes in which\r\nhis feet flapped, a silk hat of bygone glory, no collar, no cuffs. He\r\nwas of small stature, but his outfit had been created for no little\r\nman. A wonderful ‘gift of gab’ had he; in a few moments I knew his\r\nwhole history. He had acquired his knowledge of English in the States,\r\nwhere in the ’sixties he had served (probably soup) with the Stars\r\nand Stripes when the Stars and Bars were in the field. But--and the\r\nveteran is unique in this regard--he could not procure a pension from\r\nthe United States Government. Nevertheless he loved my country. He had\r\nnever gone hungry there, while he had often felt the pangs in Bulgaria.\r\nWhat had Bulgaria done for him? Even the clothes he was wearing had\r\nbeen given him by an Englishman. For his country’s neglect of her\r\ntravelled son, he had acquired the Irish complaint, he was ‘agin’ the\r\ngovernment.’ He was for sending Prince Ferdinand to the hereafter, and\r\nfavoured the fashionable dynamite bomb. He was a simple soul; before\r\nhe could execute his plot he was sent to eternity himself--though not\r\nquite hoist by his own petard. He was shot, one bright summer evening,\r\nin the public park in front of the palace. Old Barnacle had not known\r\nDavid Harum’s precept, ‘Do unto the other feller what he would do unto\r\nyou--but do it furst.’\r\n\r\nBarnacle was an honest man, and he would have been faithful; all he\r\nneeded to make him generous was a little success. I knew him well\r\nbefore he died. But in selecting my interpreter I felt compelled to act\r\non the principle that a clever crook is sometimes a safer companion\r\nthan an honest simpleton.\r\n\r\nThe man with the bad eye proved to be a character with a most romantic\r\npast, a Continental count who had fallen from his high estate, but\r\nstill a man of good taste--particularly for food. He, too, had been a\r\nsoldier; he had commanded a company of cavalry in the Russo-Turkish\r\nwar, and could still, in his age, ride me out of my saddle. But he was\r\na Jew, and wisely, as time has proved, did not return after the war\r\nto the land of his birth. He was not a dragoman by profession, there\r\nwas nothing servile about him. An English correspondent would not have\r\ntolerated his patronage. But in America, a man and his master, and a\r\nmaster and his man, equal pretty much the same thing; and we have heard\r\nthat things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other.\r\nNo serious class prejudices hampered me, and I was content to permit my\r\nman to be my companion in a land where I could communicate direct with\r\nso few.\r\n\r\nThe Count had Bulgarian, Turkish, and Russian history, as well as all\r\nthe languages of Europe, at his fingers’ ends. In view of his many\r\naccomplishments I agreed to pay him six francs a day and his living and\r\ntravelling expenses. But this was not all my man got from me.\r\n\r\nThe price of a good lunch in London will keep two men for a day in\r\nBalkan country, but I did not know this when I commissioned the Count\r\nto provide a hamper of food for the first days of our journey. Three\r\nloaves of bread, a hunk of Bulgarian cheese, some dried lamb, and\r\ntwo bottles of native wine cost him more of my money than twice the\r\nquantity would have come to in London. After the investment he dined at\r\nthe ‘Pannachoff.’ I sat behind him unnoticed and watched him consume\r\nthree times as much food as an ordinary man.\r\n\r\nHis string of names did justice to his characteristics, Isaac\r\nSwindelbaum von Stuffsky. He was a real count: Isaac Swindelbaum was\r\nall his card bore; an impostor in his predicament would have flaunted\r\nthe title. He was called ‘count’ to his face and a ‘Russian spy’\r\nbehind his back. But he was not the latter, he was too poor. Until the\r\ncorrespondents came, he had lived on the meals and the drinks which\r\ntales of his exploits in the war that created Bulgaria won him from her\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nWhen a man has no visible means of support in either Bulgaria or Turkey\r\nhe is always labelled Spy. In Bulgaria the term is one of reproach, but\r\nin Turkey spies are looked up to and envied as among the only regularly\r\npaid servants of the Sultan. But the officers of Sofia knew that my man\r\nwas not a spy. They said he was an emissary of Russia simply because he\r\ninsisted that the great Slav country and Austria, allies for reform,\r\nwere sincere in their desire to bring about peace in Macedonia, which\r\nnone of the officers believed.\r\n\r\nIt was a run of only forty kilometres from Sofia to Radomir, but\r\nit took our train half the day to cover the distance. Radomir is\r\nthe terminus of the railway to the south, and about half-way to the\r\nfrontier. Only one mixed goods and passenger train makes the trip to\r\nand from Sofia each day, and the line is not very profitable. If the\r\nTurkish Government would allow a junction railway to be constructed\r\nfrom Uskub or Koumanova up to Egri-Palanka, this road would then be\r\ncontinued to meet it, and all Bulgaria as well as Macedonia would reap\r\na benefit. But the Turkish rulers like not civilising institutions.\r\n\r\nOur train stopped now and again to pick up some peasant’s pig or\r\nwaited ten minutes for a late passenger, and we had opportunity to see\r\nsomething of the villages at which it stopped. At one little town there\r\nwas a striking scene. It was early in March; the snow on the Balkans\r\nhad not yet begun to melt, and the peasants were still clad in their\r\nsheepskin coats. Before a low _khan_ (a caravansary) were two cavalry\r\nofficers and several private soldiers; and all about surged to and\r\nfro white-clad, furry peasants leading horses of all breeds and in\r\nall conditions--nags which had never eaten other feed than grass, and\r\nwell-groomed, blooded beasts, bred from the special stables maintained\r\nby the Government for the purpose of improving the native stock. The\r\nofficers were counting animals available for military service in case\r\nof war, and the peasants had come from miles around, eager to have\r\ntheir horses tried and graded.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this fair, riding horses were not to be hired when\r\nwe arrived at Radomir; so we negotiated for one of the customary\r\ncross-country conveyances, cast-off city carriages of all designs,\r\ndrawn by numerous nags. The drivers told my Count that were he not\r\nwith me they would get thirty francs a day from me. I should have\r\nthought that charge cheap. But, despite my price-elevating presence,\r\nmy dragoman brought them down in the end to regular fares. This Jew\r\nof mine saved double his wage every day, and though he swindled me\r\nwhenever he had an opportunity, no one else had the chance while he was\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nBut the bargain took a long time to strike. For an hour he wrangled\r\nwith these drivers, who seemed to have formed an anti-American trust.\r\nAt last I entered the negotiations, and demanded what all the talk was\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n‘I’m saving money for you,’ the Count informed me. ‘I’ve got them down\r\nto twelve francs.’\r\n\r\n‘Good! then hire a team and we will start.’\r\n\r\n‘I’ve just hired this man,’ said the Count, and he proceeded to inform\r\none of the clamouring coachmen that he was engaged. The delighted\r\ndriver dashed off to get his team, and in a few minutes a jingle of\r\nbells announced his return with the coach. It was a most dilapidated\r\nvehicle, patched and strengthened with many pieces of rough plank and\r\nbits of rope; but they were all alike.\r\n\r\nI had particularly fancied a four-horse team, the horses all abreast as\r\nin a chariot, but this hired by the Count had only three.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNTING ANIMALS AVAILABLE FOR MILITARY SERVICE.]\r\n\r\n‘I think we had better have four horses, Count,’ I suggested. ‘We have\r\na long drive before us, and I don’t like moving slowly.’\r\n\r\n‘I have already engaged this man, sir. He asks only twelve francs a day\r\nand guarantees to get us over the mountains in the best time possible.’\r\n\r\n‘What’s the price of a four-horse team?’\r\n\r\n‘They ask fifteen francs.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, I think we can afford twelve shillings for a conveyance, four\r\nhorses and a man, Count!’\r\n\r\n‘But I have already engaged this man, sir.’\r\n\r\n‘Count, we will take a four-horse team.’\r\n\r\nThe Count expostulated, and I had to repeat. It was then I discovered\r\nthat there was something of the Rob Roy in my old Jew. He would rob me\r\nbecause, as he informed me later, Americans were rolling in wealth, but\r\nhe was going to do the right thing by a peasant.\r\n\r\n‘But I have hired this man, sir,’ he said again. ‘We shall have to pay\r\nhim if we take another.’\r\n\r\nI told the Count to give him half a day’s wages, which he did, and the\r\npeasant nearly collapsed with surprise.\r\n\r\nThe drive over the mountains to Kustendil consumed six hours, so we did\r\nnot arrive there until long after dark.\r\n\r\nMy advance had been telegraphed ahead from Sofia, and soon after\r\nbreakfast next morning I was waited on by the governor of the district\r\nand all his staff in a body. The governor had instructions from the\r\nMinister of the Interior to facilitate my journey in every way, and was\r\nready to do anything he could to aid me. I expressed my appreciation of\r\nhis kindness, and promised to avail myself of it if necessary. There\r\nwas method in this hospitality: the Bulgarians are not ordinarily so\r\npolite.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of an American correspondent was a great event in\r\nthe little town, and hard on the heels of the governor came two\r\nEnglish-speaking Bulgars, college graduates respectively of Princeton\r\nand the University of West Virginia. One of them was a magistrate,\r\nthe other a minister acting under the direction of the American\r\nmissionaries. Politically the magistrate and the governor were enemies,\r\nand the officials, all members of the Orthodox Church, were none too\r\nfriendly with the Protestant preacher. The courtesy between the parties\r\nwas stiff and measured. When the governor and his staff took their\r\nleave, the minister and the judge commandeered me for the rest of the\r\nday to talk over old times in America. We went over to Fournagieff’s\r\nhome, a plain building with whitewashed walls of stucco, a low door,\r\nand a narrow, ladder-like staircase leading up to the mission-room.\r\nThere we hunted out a book of college songs, and all three sang old\r\nPrinceton airs for an hour to the accompaniment of an American melodeon.\r\n\r\nFournagieff’s father was among the refugees from Macedonia who were\r\nthen in Kustendil, having come across the border to escape a search for\r\narms in the Raslog district. I could not get the old man to admit his\r\nassociation with the _Committajis_ (committee-men), but I think there\r\nis no doubt that he was a local _voivoda_. At any rate, the Turkish\r\nofficials suspected him of being a chief, of organising and arming the\r\npeasants of his village, and planned to subject him with others to an\r\ninquisition; but a friendly Turk warned him of the prospective arrival\r\nof troops and advised escape. Old Fournagieff’s Turkish friend supplied\r\na testimonial vouching for his loyalty to the Padisha, which enabled\r\nhim to pass over to Bulgaria by the bridge on the Struma, and saved him\r\nthe hardship and dangers of climbing the border Balkans between Turkish\r\nposts.\r\n\r\nKustendil is not a favourite place of refuge, and there were few\r\nfugitives here; but the town suits the purposes of the insurgents, and\r\nrightly has a bad name among the Turks for breeding ‘brigands.’ The\r\nmountains in this district are wooded and rugged, and an infinitely\r\nlarger and more vigilant force than the Turkish Government maintains\r\non the frontier is necessary to close it to the committajis. There\r\nwere several bands in Kustendil at this time, preparing to cross into\r\nTurkey, and the leaders of one called at the hotel and invited me to\r\naccompany them. I should see everything in Macedonia, they said, if I\r\nwent under their guidance, whereas, if I trusted myself to the Turks,\r\nI should see only the beauties of the land and none of its horrors.\r\nI questioned these fellows as to the conditions of the scheme, and\r\nlearned these: I should have to travel by night and keep closely\r\nhidden by day; I should have to wear the peasant garb peculiar to\r\nthe district in which I was, and raise a beard to hide my foreign\r\nphysiognomy; I should have to live on the coarsest of native food and\r\nsometimes go without any; I should not be allowed to talk to anyone,\r\nfor the band could not take along my antique interpreter.\r\n\r\nI was very anxious to see one of their fights, I said, and I asked if\r\nthey would have one within a reasonable time.\r\n\r\nCertainly, came the reply; they could have a small one whenever I liked.\r\n\r\nI was much tempted to the adventure, but afraid to trust myself to the\r\ntender mercies of these ‘brigands,’ and mildly told them so. This gave\r\nthe leader an idea.\r\n\r\n‘Would you like to get rich?’ he asked.\r\n\r\n‘I would,’ I replied.\r\n\r\n‘If you will permit us to capture you, we will share whatever ransom we\r\nobtain.’\r\n\r\nBefore I could reply the Count delivered his advice, which it suited me\r\nto follow. The Count did not like the idea of the brigands taking me\r\nout of his hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON A FRONTIER BRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nWhile I was entertaining the committajis the governor returned to the\r\nkhan to invite me to luncheon, and entered my room unannounced. I\r\nexpected to see a hurried scattering of my guests, but none of them so\r\nmuch as changed countenance. The governor took them in at a glance,\r\nbut otherwise completely ignored them. At this time the Bulgarian\r\nForeign Office was declaring emphatically that every effort was\r\nbeing made to prevent the passing of bands from the Principality into\r\nthe sovereign State, so it rested with the governor to make excuse for\r\nthe inactivity of the law in this case. The governor gave explanation\r\nat his table. He said he knew every one of the insurgents who were in\r\nmy room, and that they were all bogus warriors, not worthy of arrest.\r\nNone of them had ever been to Turkey. They belonged to the External\r\nCommittee, and they took good care to do no internal work.\r\n\r\nWhile strolling through the town with my Count at a later day, there\r\nappeared a band of some twenty unarmed insurgents under arrest. One\r\ngendarme had charge of the whole party, and took little heed of their\r\nscattering. They were on their way to Sofia. They had just come back\r\nfrom Macedonia after hiding their arms in the mountains, and had\r\ncome down to the town to surrender. If they allowed themselves to\r\nbe arrested, I understood, they received free transportation to the\r\ncapital, where their names were recorded and they were set free on\r\nparole; whereas, if they avoided arrest, they were compelled to walk to\r\nwherever they would be, for none of them possessed sufficient money to\r\npay railway or coach fare.\r\n\r\nThey were a mongrel crew, only one clean ‘man’ among them, and that a\r\nwoman. They looked as if they had seen service. Their outfits covered\r\na wide range of variety, and were much torn and tattered. A few had\r\nmilitary overcoats with many patches, some wore native cloaks of\r\nbroad black and white stripes, and others were wrapped in blankets\r\nlike American Indians. The woman had no greatcoat, but her uniform\r\nwas warmer and in better condition than those of the men: the patches\r\nwere perfect. She carried a needle and thread, but only one kind of\r\nmedicine, though a red cross decorated her arm. She caught my eye at\r\nonce, and I sent the Count into the band to ascertain if she would\r\nhonour me with an interview. My man went up to her with the blunt and\r\nburly manner he was wont to wear, grabbed her by the arm, and explained\r\nhis errand in a word. This, I can imagine, is what he said: ‘Come with\r\nme; an American correspondent wants to hear your story!’ The whole\r\nband, including the single guard, stopped, wheeled round, and followed\r\nthe bad-eyed Count and his captive. They gathered about the girl and\r\nme, and prompted her memory whenever it failed on points of detail.\r\n\r\nWe sat on two empty wine casks in front of a peasant’s khan, and I took\r\nnotes as the Count drew from the Amazon an account of her adventures\r\nbeyond the border.\r\n\r\nThis band had been in the enemy’s country for about six months, in\r\nwhich time they had had five fights, and she estimated that she herself\r\nhad killed and wounded no fewer than eight Turks. While she talked she\r\ncrossed her trousered limbs and drew a dagger from her legging as a\r\nScot would from his sock. She tossed the weapon about and caught it\r\ndexterously by the handle, and told me how she marched with her\r\nbrothers-in-arms fifty miles and more a night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AMAZON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MASCOT.]\r\n\r\nIn the daytime they rested at the summit of some lonely mountain\r\nwhich commanded a length of road and a breadth of valley, and from\r\nthese ‘crows’ nests’ in the height descended by night to ambush small\r\nbodies of Turks or swoop down on little towns, attempting the total\r\ndestruction of the garrison and the last male Moslem therein. This\r\nwoman had no mercy on Turks; she said they had slain her mother, her\r\nfather, and all her brothers in one day. She was a soldier of fortune;\r\nrevenge was hers, and hope for Macedonia. In concluding her remarks\r\nthe lady drew a phial of arsenic from her trousers-pocket and informed\r\nme that the poison was for the purpose of taking her own life in case\r\nof capture by the Turks. I took her photograph, with and without her\r\ncompanions, and the whole band shook hands with me and resumed their\r\nmarch to the railway terminus.\r\n\r\nThis was the only female fighter I encountered on my tracks through\r\nthe Balkans, but there are many with the bands. A missionary told\r\nme an interesting story of one, which throws light on the strange\r\nmental workings of some of the insurgent chiefs. The missionary met\r\nthe Amazon, a pretty young woman about twenty, wandering along a high\r\nroad near Samakov. The girl asked the way to the town, and told the\r\nfollowing story: She had been betrothed to a young man who felt called\r\nto the service of his country. She threatened her lover that if he\r\njoined a revolutionary band she would go with him. Both firm in their\r\npurpose, they both joined the band, and for several weeks fought side\r\nby side. But the girl was not able to stand the hardships, and the\r\nheavy work soon began to tell on her. She began to lag behind the\r\nothers on the hard night marches, and would not have been able to keep\r\nup at all except for the assistance of her strong young lover. Finally\r\nthe voivoda called the man before him and delivered himself thus:\r\n‘Committajis have their work to do and cannot be hampered with women.\r\nThe woman must be left behind to-night, but you must continue with the\r\nband.’ The man protested, entreated, threatened, but all to no avail.\r\nThat night the insurgents started, leaving the woman to an unknown\r\nfate; the man refused to accompany them. The chief did not hesitate to\r\norder the recognised punishment, and his men, though they liked the\r\nyoung man well, did not hesitate to execute the command.\r\n\r\nThe youth was taken into a secluded dell, from which he never came\r\nforth. The girl listened, but no sound escaped. The report of a gun\r\nmight have attracted Turks.\r\n\r\nShe found his body later, stabbed, and buried it in leaves. The\r\ninsurgents punish with death; they have no prisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE ROAD TO RILO\r\n\r\n\r\nA representative body of Bulgarians assembled at the khan on the\r\nmorning of our departure from Kustendil. Several army officers, who\r\nwere staying at the khan, rose early and ate a five-o’clock breakfast\r\nwith us; a deputation of committajis arrived before we had finished\r\nthe meal; at six o’clock the missionary and the judge appeared; and a\r\nmounted officer and two gendarmes drew up before the door; peasants on\r\ntheir way to the fields, and meek and miserable refugees, for want of\r\nsomething better to do, gathered to see the strange foreigners depart.\r\nEverybody was anxious to be of service to us, and ready at a word to do\r\nanything we required. But the judge and the minister managed to secure\r\nall of my few commissions, because they, speaking English, did not have\r\nto wait like the others until the Count interpreted my wants. I had to\r\narrange several minor matters, such as the forwarding of telegrams and\r\nletters, and to send some of my luggage back to Sofia, because we had\r\ndischarged our shandrydan at this point, and would proceed down the\r\nfrontier mounted.\r\n\r\nWhile I was engaged stuffing a toothbrush, a box of Keating’s, a\r\ncouple of pairs of socks, and other absolute necessities into my\r\nsaddle-bags, the Count, ever busying himself with money matters, went\r\nto the _khanji_ and requested the statement of our account. Now, the\r\ninnkeeper was a Greek, and, true to Hellenic principles, he had charged\r\nus all and more than he had any hope of getting. He tried to put the\r\nCount off and get a settlement from me. But my Jew was not to be thrust\r\naside by any mere Greek.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Greek meets Jew.\r\n\r\nThe _khanji_ informed the Count--after much insistence on the part\r\nof the latter--that we owed him a sum of several napoleons (I do not\r\nremember the exact amount).\r\n\r\n‘What!’ exclaimed the Jew. ‘Let me see your book.’\r\n\r\nThe Greek passed over a much ear-marked memorandum book in which\r\nhe had kept the record of the number of nights we had slept at his\r\nhostelry, and what we had eaten. We had been charged three francs per\r\nnight per cot, while two officers who shared a room with us and had\r\nlike accommodation, were paying less than a franc apiece; two francs\r\nfifty for each meal--for which the Bulgarians paid less than a third\r\nas much--and a franc a flagon for the Count’s wine, correspondingly\r\nhigh for the native vintage. My man began to talk to the _khanji_ in\r\nloud, loose language, which let the entire assembly know of the Greek’s\r\ncrime. The officers, the committajis, and even the ordinary natives\r\nbecame indignant at this ‘attempt to impose on a foreigner,’ and in a\r\nbody joined the Count in abusing the garrulous Greek. The Greek stood\r\nhis ground in a manner worthy of his ancient forefathers, and declined\r\nto take one sou off his bill, arguing that I should pay at the rate at\r\nwhich I was accustomed to paying. The foreigner, he contended, should\r\nnot profit by native prices, but the native should profit by foreign\r\nprices. Good reasoning. I offered to ‘split the difference’ between\r\nnative and foreign prices. The Greek agreed, but the sum to be paid\r\nfigured out too much to meet the approval of the Count, who left the\r\nkhan most disgruntled, because, he said sorrowfully, ‘It hurts me to\r\nbe cheated; and even if it suits you to throw away money, I would have\r\nyou refrain from lavishing it upon Greeks, who do not appreciate it,\r\nand puff themselves up with pride at having successfully swindled me!’\r\nMy old Jew assumed more the _rôle_ of manager than man, and I did not\r\ndislike him for it. While I acted on my own judgment in matters of\r\nmore or less importance, I always listened to his counsel, for it was\r\ngenerally good, and I took no measures to suppress him.\r\n\r\nWe made so early a start from Kustendil that the governor was unable to\r\nbe present; but he sent a representative to wish us a pleasant journey\r\nand to offer me an escort of gendarmes.\r\n\r\n‘Isn’t the district safe?’ I asked.\r\n\r\nThe question was offensive. Everybody generally responded to my\r\ninquiries in one breath, but this brought a dignified silence over the\r\nassembly; only the official person, the governor’s representative,\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n‘Every district in Bulgaria is perfectly safe. You can travel anywhere\r\nin our land as securely as you can in your own.’\r\n\r\n‘Then of course we need no escort?’\r\n\r\n‘But there is danger,’ interrupted the Count, unconsciously blinking\r\nhis bad eye. ‘The route which we are taking is seldom travelled, and if\r\nwe encounter border patrols we shall arouse suspicion.’ The Count knew\r\nwhat the company of gendarmes would mean in foraging, and to old Von\r\nStuffsky the grub was the thing!\r\n\r\nThe gendarmes were fairly well mounted, but the only animals that we\r\ncould obtain were two tiny pack-ponies full of tantalising pack-train\r\nhabits. They were strong little beasts, and could travel all day\r\nwithout showing fatigue, but it was impossible to get them out of a\r\npack-train gait, and under no circumstance would they travel side by\r\nside. After the Count had struggled desperately with his little brute\r\nfor quite an hour, he borrowed one of the officer’s spurs, and we all\r\nhalted while he sat on a rock and fastened it to a foot; for had we not\r\nwaited, the Count’s animal, having no other to follow, would have taken\r\nhim back to its stable. When the old man mounted again his temper had\r\ncooled, and instead of giving his pony a vicious kick, as I expected,\r\nhe brought his heels together gently but firmly. The horse lifted a\r\nhind leg and kicked viciously at the bite. But this did not rid him of\r\nthe annoyance, so he turned his head around and sought the insect with\r\nhis teeth. For this he got a kick in the nose, and then began to learn\r\nwhat the spur meant.\r\n\r\nThe price for the hire of the ponies was absurd, a franc a day apiece;\r\nand we paid another franc a day for a boy to go with us and care for\r\nthem. This boy was wise; he came along on foot.\r\n\r\nFrom the crest of the first high hill Macedonia came into view. The\r\nland sweeps on as one; there is no line to mark where Occident ends and\r\nOrient begins; but somewhere down there the order of things reverses.\r\nHere, where we stood, the Mohamedan is the infidel; across the valley\r\nthe Christian is the _giaour_.\r\n\r\nWe took a course generally along the Struma, as near the border as\r\nwe could pass without being halted by frontier guards. We kept to\r\nthe north bank as much as possible; when compelled, because of bad\r\nground, to take the south side, we did not lose sight of the river,\r\nfor there was no other line to keep us within the border. There was\r\nno high road on our route, and for many miles not even a footpath. We\r\nhad no guide, and neither of the gendarmes had been over the route\r\nbefore. Consequently we had often to retrace our steps and make long\r\ndétours, sometimes for miles, when we happened to get into a ‘blind’\r\ncañon or meet the edge of a mountain side too steep for descent. Once,\r\nwhile following the river (which was generally fordable), we came to\r\na gorge less than a hundred feet in breadth, through which the water\r\npoured swift and deep, and on both sides the mountains rose almost\r\nperpendicularly. We could not venture the horses into the seething\r\nwaters, nor was it possible to get them up the steep slopes, so we\r\nwere obliged to make our way back up stream until we found an incline\r\ngradual enough to climb.\r\n\r\nIt was often necessary to dismount and make our way on foot. For\r\nseveral miles we followed a footpath seldom more than two feet wide,\r\nhigh up on the side of a steep, rocky mountain. Fortunately the ponies\r\nwere cool-headed and sure-footed. On one such ledge we overtook a\r\ncommittaji pack-train making its way towards the frontier from Dupnitza\r\nwith ammunition and provisions for a band. We hailed the insurgents and\r\naccompanied them to an apparently deserted hut with a little wooden\r\ncross at its top. When we came in sight of this place the voivoda gave\r\na long, loud whistle, and two men appeared. Where were the others? We\r\nwere all disappointed to hear that the band had had a good opportunity\r\nto cross the border the evening before, and had gone back into Turkey\r\nwithout waiting for the supplies.\r\n\r\nWe ate lunch at the insurgent armoury, and had a contest at\r\ntarget-shooting after the meal. Some of the insurgents were very good\r\nmarksmen, but the gendarmerie officer hit more ‘bull’s eyes’ than any\r\nof us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROAD TO RILO.]\r\n\r\nFor hours before we came upon this hut we had not passed a single\r\nhabitation, and for quite a while after we left it the mountains were\r\ncompletely deserted. It was just the place for a brigand camp. Most of\r\nthe country through which we passed this day was not only uncultivated,\r\nbut almost entirely barren; dwarfed shrubs grew in patches here and\r\nthere, but no woods did we pass in the whole twelve hours’ track.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we came upon a faint footpath which led in our\r\ndirection. After following it for half an hour, we found it change\r\nabruptly into a waggon track, though no farmhouse or ploughed field\r\nexcused this sudden transformation. The road began at nowhere, but led\r\ndown to the river again, through it, and up to Boborshevo, where we had\r\nplanned to spend the night. We found our boy already established at the\r\nkhan; he had outstripped us early in the day.\r\n\r\nWe were all weary and dusty, and ravenously hungry, but the khan’s\r\nlarder contained only a huge round loaf of brown bread, a few bits of\r\ngarlic, and the materials for Turkish coffee, which I had not yet come\r\nto regard as fit to drink; nor did it seem possible to obtain much\r\nelse in the village. We despatched the boy to make inquiries, and he\r\nreturned with the information that each of four peasant families could\r\nsupply a loaf. Not a very promising outlook for supper! I asked if the\r\nvillagers ate nothing else themselves, and learned that they lived\r\npractically by bread alone. They have generally a bit of cheese or an\r\nonion with which to flavour the bread; but meat or fowl or eggs they\r\nindulge in only on fête days.\r\n\r\nBut our gendarmes assured us that we should get a supper, and presently\r\nthe meal came bleating through the door. It was allowed to stop in the\r\ncafé for a few minutes, where it cuddled up to the Count, while the\r\n_khanji_ sharpened his knife. Then the poor little thing was dragged\r\nback into the stable, and in about half an hour a smoking stew was set\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\nThis town afforded about the worst accommodation we had yet found, but\r\nit provided a wandering minstrel. All the creature could do was laugh;\r\nbut his laugh was incessant and infectious. We gave him supper, and\r\nhe returned again in the morning for breakfast, whereafter I took the\r\npreceding photograph of him, which by no means does justice to the\r\nbreadth of his grin. The cap which he wore was made (he told us) by an\r\ninsurgent in a band with which he had travelled as a mascot. It was an\r\nextra large committaji cap bearing the committee’s motto, in the usual\r\nbrass design,‘Liberty or Death.’ It lacked, however, the skull and\r\ncrossbones sometimes worn.\r\n\r\nThe _khanji_ at Boborshevo apologised for the bill he presented at\r\nour departure. He had stabled and fed nine of us, including the four\r\nponies, and our indebtedness came to a grand total of eleven francs!\r\nThe khan-keeper was a Bulgarian.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe that a Turk swindles you to demonstrate\r\nto himself how much more clever he is than is an ‘infidel’; a Greek\r\nswindles you because he desires your money; while both Turk and Greek\r\ndeclare the Bulgarian too stupid to cheat.\r\n\r\nWe expected to find a high road leading out of Boborshevo, but if there\r\nwas one it did not lead in our direction. The only road towards the\r\neast was another waggon track which again crossed the Struma. By this\r\ntime we had come to feel as much at home in the water as out of it. We\r\nhad at first shown consideration for our boy by taking him across the\r\nriver on one of our horses, but we both got tired of this, and he soon\r\nstruck his own course, invariably arriving at appointed meeting places\r\nan hour or more before us. We met him at Kotcharinova this day at noon,\r\nresting at the village fountain and making a meal of bread and lump\r\nsugar. He declined a piece of lamb, saying that to eat meat two days in\r\nsuccession would make him ill.\r\n\r\nTo the south of Kotcharinova, less than half a mile, is a border post,\r\nwhere the casernes of the respective forces stand on the opposite\r\nshores of the narrow Struma, and the Bulgarian and Turkish sentries\r\npace side by side, bayonets fixed, at the centre of the bridge. We\r\nmade a détour to Barakova (such is the name of this post), leaving our\r\nescort to await us on the road to Rilo. There was no difficulty in\r\nsecuring from the Bulgarian officer permission to visit the Turkish\r\nside, but we were halted for a quarter of an hour at the magic line\r\nwhile the Turkish sentry called the corporal, and the corporal called\r\nthe sergeant, and the sergeant went and waked the commandant, who\r\nfirst peeped out of his window, then rose, dressed, and came to fetch\r\nus. The first remarks of this smartly uniformed officer, who spoke some\r\nFrench, were in the nature of apologies for the Turkish part of the\r\nbridge; a _Graphic_ artist, with whom I visited Barakova a year later,\r\ndescribed it as ‘made of holes with a few boards between.’\r\n\r\nThe half-dozen fezzed soldiers whom we saw from the bridge were fine\r\nspecimens of men, and at a glance compared favourably in uniforms and\r\narms with the Bulgarians. I was curious to go through their camp, but\r\nthe officer would show me only his own room. The Turks possess no\r\nmilitary secret unknown to the European, but they are all afraid he\r\nmight find one in their camps.\r\n\r\n‘It is quite absurd,’ said the officer at Barakova, as, seated on his\r\nrough divans, we sipped his coffee; ‘it is quite absurd for the foreign\r\njournals to say that Turks commit atrocities. We are a highly civilised\r\npeople, and our Padisha is a most enlightened and humane monarch, and\r\nit is ridiculous to accuse him or his army of doing a single barbarous\r\ndeed. Now, the Bulgarians are barbarians, and, naturally, it is they\r\nwho perpetrate all these massacres and other horrible crimes.\r\n\r\n‘Tell me,’ continued the Turk without abatement, ‘are sections of\r\nAmerica still barbarous? I read of blacks being burned at the stake.’\r\nClever Turk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BULGARIAN BLOCKHOUSE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRIDGE OVER THE STRUMA: TURK AND BULGAR.]\r\n\r\nMore than a year later I returned to Barakova from the Turkish side\r\nand asked the same Turkish commander for permission to visit the\r\nBulgarian barracks; but he had many excuses to offer. Perhaps the\r\nBulgarian garrison would not like us to visit them unannounced; it was\r\nagainst all regulations for anyone to step across that border without\r\na passavant which could not be issued nearer than at Djuma-bala; if\r\nanything should happen to us while on the Bulgarian side, the Padisha\r\nwould be seriously grieved at his (the officer’s) having permitted us\r\nto go over into Bulgaria. But we had despatches to forward and letters\r\nto post, and vented upon the Turk three hours’ persistent persuasion,\r\nwhen finally he consented to take us over the bridge himself. Six other\r\nofficers accompanied him, and our interpreter was detained in the\r\nTurkish barracks as a hostage. There was no other way than to deliver\r\nour letters to the Bulgarians in the presence of the Turks, and the\r\nmoment was awkward for all parties.\r\n\r\nShortly after leaving Barakova we got the first view of Perim Dagh,\r\na celebrated high peak in Macedonia, renowned among the Bulgarians\r\nas the mountain from which Sarafoff issued his call ‘to his\r\nbrothers’--Sarafoff and St. Paul!--to come over into Macedonia and help\r\nhim!\r\n\r\nThis was a more productive district than that through which we had\r\npassed the day before; the land was generally tilled and settlements\r\nwere comparatively numerous. And after passing Rilo Silo (Rilo\r\nvillage), where the long climb to the monastery begins, the way leads\r\nthrough a dense forest which covers the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe road to Rilo is by the side of a rapid brook, which has its source\r\nsomewhere in the wild woods far above the monastery, up under the line\r\nof perpetual snow. It tumbles for more than twenty miles over the small\r\nboulders, and between the big ones, down, down, down to the village;\r\nthis, at least, is as far as I know it tumbles, from having followed\r\nit. On both sides of the brook rise the Balkans, the crest of the range\r\nto the south forming the border-line. From Rilo Silo to Rilo Monastery\r\nthere is but one pass through these mountains, and in this gateway to\r\nTurkey stands the Bulgarian blockhouse shown in the preceding picture.\r\nIn spite of the fact that it was yet winter, the leaves on the trees\r\nwere thick enough to keep the rays of sun from the road, and there\r\nwas a chill under the grove which soon caused us all to unpack our\r\ngreatcoats. As our elevation increased, the air grew yet colder; the\r\nbrook took on icy rims, icicles clung to the bigger boulders, and\r\nsnowdrifts lodged by the side of the road. We dismounted one by one,\r\nfor the slow up-hill pace of the horses afforded no exercise, and we\r\nneeded more warmth than our coats would give. The gendarmes, as I have\r\nsaid, were better mounted than were the Count and I, but on foot we\r\nhad the advantage of them. Their horses had always to be led--and did\r\nnot lead as well as they drove--while our pack-ponies, ever content to\r\nfollow pace, could be turned loose, and would follow the other animals\r\nas tenaciously as if tied to their tails.\r\n\r\nThe sun had long dropped behind the mountains--though the day had\r\nnot yet gone--when we emerged from the forest into a clearing, and\r\nthe first view of the great, bleak, deserted-looking monastery broke\r\nsuddenly upon us. The heavy gates were swung back, grating on their\r\nrusty hinges, and a long-bearded, black-robed priest came forth to\r\nwelcome us. The gendarmerie officer had telegraphed from Rilo Silo that\r\nwe would arrive that night, and the hospitable monks had got our rooms\r\nwarm and ready, and prepared a splendid supper for us.\r\n\r\nThere was no fireplace or stove in the room which was allotted to me,\r\nbut a broad, tiled chimney came through the wall from an ante-room.\r\nA queer little dwarf--not a monk, but long-haired and bearded like\r\nthem--who occupied this room, was assigned to the task of waiting on us\r\nand stoking the fire in the oven.\r\n\r\nThe Rilo Monastery is a great rectangular pile four storeys high,\r\nbuilt of stone around a spacious courtyard. On the outside a height\r\nof sheer wall is broken by small barred windows only above the second\r\nfloor, and two arched gateways below, one at each end of the place.\r\nThe old convent was built for siege. Within, facing on the courtyard,\r\nare broad balconies, quite a sixth of a mile around. The chapel stands\r\nin the centre of the court, and beside it there is an ancient tower\r\nand dungeon dating from mediæval times. Although the foundation of\r\nthe monastery is very old, most of the present structure and the\r\nchurch date from only 150 years back. At one time it sheltered several\r\nhundred monks, but the number has dwindled away until to-day there are\r\nbut fifty or sixty there. The old abbot said ruefully that since the\r\nBulgarians had become free they are not so willing to enter holy orders\r\nas they were when under the Turks. Naturally; this monastery, for some\r\nreason, was always exempt from ravage by Turkish troops, and to enter\r\nit was to find safety for body as well as soul. The greater part of the\r\nbuilding is now usually unoccupied, and its vast, bare rooms have a\r\nmost desolate appearance.\r\n\r\nThe painting of the place is most peculiar. Outside the stones are\r\nleft their natural colour, but the courtyard walls are whitewashed and\r\nstriped with red. The balconies and the overhanging roof, the rafters\r\nof which are visible, are almost black from age. The place would be\r\nmagnificent were it not made hideous with atrocious frescoes, which\r\nmight have originated in the mind of a Doré and must have been executed\r\nby a schoolboy. The pictures covering both the outer and inner walls\r\nof the chapel, which stands in the centre of the court, are grouped\r\nin pairs or sets, and portray side by side the after torments of the\r\nwicked and the bliss of the good. Many of the sleeping-rooms are\r\nlikewise decorated in a manner conducive to nightmare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RILO MONASTERY: GRACE BEFORE GRUB.]\r\n\r\nThere is a museum at Rilo of old Bulgarian books, icons, and other\r\nchurch relics, of all of which the monks are very proud. Many of the\r\nbooks were saved from destruction at the hands of the Greek priests\r\nin their late attempt to Hellenise the Bulgarians by obliterating their\r\nlanguage. There are presents from the Sultans, and some articles of\r\nintrinsic value.\r\n\r\nI was much interested in a retired brigand who lived at the monastery,\r\nand invited him and a committaji sojourning there to join us one\r\nevening at supper. We were a strange gathering that sat down to the\r\nmonks’ good fare that memorable night. There were many monks, in\r\nflowing robes and headgear like stove-pipe hats worn upside down.\r\nIn the centre of this sombre assembly was our party: the brigand, a\r\npowerful mountain fellow who had worn his weapons day and night for\r\nthirty years; a desperate revolutionist engaged in directing the\r\npassage of bands across the Balkans; a border officer who had been\r\npicked for his nerve and judgment to serve on the Turkish frontier; my\r\nCount and myself.\r\n\r\nIt took much persuasion and many glasses of the monks’ good wine to\r\nmake the brigand tell us of his adventures; but when he had fairly\r\nbegun he went into most extravagant detail and gave us substantial\r\ndemonstration of how he had done his many deeds of valour. He took his\r\nyataghan and wielded it about him in a desperate manner as he told\r\nus of how, when surrounded on one occasion, he cut his way through\r\noverwhelming numbers of Turkish troops; he drew his dagger at another\r\nperiod and crept stealthily along to slay an adversary by surprise;\r\nand he stretched himself full length on the floor and aimed his rifle\r\nover imaginary rocks when giving an account of what he considered the\r\nnarrowest escape he had ever had.\r\n\r\nHe and his band had been forced by a body of Turks up a mountain side\r\nat the back of which was a yawning precipice. Half of his men dropped\r\nbehind rocks and held the Turks at bay while the others took off their\r\nlong red sashes and tied them together into a rope, by which all but\r\nfour managed to escape by sliding down the chasm into a thickly wooded\r\nvalley below. The brigand told us that he had chopped off the heads of\r\nTurks with a single blow, and had to his credit in all seventeen dead\r\nmen. He was an Albanian--a Christian Albanian--which accounts for the\r\nrecord he kept of his killings.\r\n\r\nEverybody at the monastery but myself was accustomed to such narratives\r\nas these, and no one else--not even the holy monks--showed the least\r\nemotion at the bloody recital. It was purely for my benefit.\r\n\r\nTowards midnight the conversation turned to combats to come, and both\r\nthe officer and the committaji assured me there would be no lack of\r\nblood-letting as soon as the snows melted. Ammunition was going across\r\nthe frontier nightly, and preparations for the revolution were being\r\nprosecuted vigorously under the very noses of the Turkish authorities.\r\nBut it was necessary in some districts, where the Government officials\r\nwere keenly on the alert, to adopt curious means of getting arms\r\ninto the towns. The insurgent told this story of how a supply of\r\ndynamite bombs was got into Monastir. A funeral parade started from an\r\nungarrisoned village near by, and marched into the town to the solemn\r\nchant of a mock priest, attired in gilded vestments, and acolytes\r\nswinging incense. Mourners, men and women, followed the corpse, weeping\r\ncopiously. The Turks did not notice that the dead man was exceptionally\r\nheavy, and required twice the usual number of pall-bearers. The\r\ninsurgents buried their load in the Bulgarian cemetery with all due\r\ndust to dust and ashes to ashes. The local voivodas were apprised of\r\nthe fact, and the following night a select delegation robbed the grave.\r\n\r\nThere were no refugees at Rilo on the occasion of my first visit.\r\nSeveral months had elapsed since the search for arms in the Struma\r\nand Razlog districts, and the fugitives who had come to the monastery\r\nto escape this inquisition in Macedonia had now moved on to the towns\r\nand villages further from the frontier. But six months later, when\r\nI returned after the revolution in Macedonia, the place was crowded\r\nwith refugees. There were nearly two thousand quartered in the main\r\nbuilding and in the stables and cornbins round about, and more were\r\narriving daily. Some reached the monastery driving a cow or two, and\r\nothers leading ponies and donkeys heavily laden with all their poor\r\npossessions; but many came with only what they carried on their backs.\r\nThe special burden of the little girls seemed to be their mothers’\r\nbabies, borne in bags strapped to their backs.\r\n\r\nSome of the young mothers bore between their eyes peculiar marks which\r\nattracted my attention. They were crosses tattooed there. They told me\r\nthat these life marks were for the purpose of preventing the Turks from\r\nstealing them; but I am of the opinion that the sign of the Cross would\r\nnot prevent a Moslem from taking a Christian woman.\r\n\r\nA caravan of pack-ponies arrived at Rilo every morning, bringing bread,\r\nwhich was supplied to the refugees by the Bulgarian Government. Besides\r\nthis they received soup from the monastery once a day.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen at Rilo is quite worthy of description. It is on the ground\r\nfloor, but above it there are no other rooms. Its walls go up to the\r\nroof. The fire is built in the centre of the room, on the floor, which\r\nis of stone, and the smoke rises a hundred feet and escapes through\r\na round hole about a foot in diameter. The refugee soup was boiled\r\nin a huge iron cauldron, suspended by chains over the fire. So large\r\nwas this pot that the cook had to stand on a box to stir the boiling\r\nbeverage, which he did with a great wooden spoon almost as long as\r\nhimself. At noon the refugees gathered in the courtyard with earthen\r\nvessels, and as the names of their villages were called they came up\r\nto the pot, and the old grey-bearded cook dished out a big spoonful\r\nof soup to each mother, and a monk handed her a loaf or more of bread\r\naccording to the number of children she had.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FATHER COOK AND THE BRIGAND.]\r\n\r\nThe native costumes of the Macedonians are of the gayest colours,\r\nand this midday scene was beautiful as well as pitiable. But there was\r\na night scene at the monastery which was even more fascinating. There\r\nwere two companies of infantry also quartered here, and as there was\r\nno hall to spare for use as mess-room, they were obliged to eat their\r\nmeals in the open courtyard. A few minutes before the supper-hour\r\npots of stew or soup, or other army rations, were set in a row on the\r\nstone pavement. When the call to mess was sounded the soldiers fell in\r\nbehind the pots, each with half a loaf of bread and a tin spoon, and\r\nstood facing the chapel. The drums beat again, and with one accord the\r\nline of yellow-coated men doffed their caps. Their officer, likewise\r\nreverencing, pronounced the grace, and the company made the sign of the\r\nCross three times in drill regularity. The men then seated themselves,\r\neight round a pot, and began their meal in the golden light of pine\r\ntorches fastened to the great pillars which support the balconies.\r\n\r\nIn the Balkans the Christian call to mass is beaten on a pine board.\r\nThe hours of prayer are regular at Rilo, and the time of day is told by\r\nthe shrill tattoo. The next lap of our trail was long, and we rose and\r\nsaddled horses at the call to six o’clock mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE TRAIL OF THE MISSIONARIES\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Rilo it is a day’s track to Samakov, a primitive, dreamy town,\r\nfull of frontier colour and character. A mosque and a Turkish fountain\r\nstill do duty in the market place, and many times a day Turks come to\r\nthe fountain to wash before entering the mosque to prayer--just as they\r\ndo across the border. But over there the Christian drawing drinking\r\nwater makes way for the Moslem to wash his feet, while here the Turk is\r\nmade to wait his turn like any other man. Samakov is much like other\r\nborder towns, built largely of mud bricks, roofed with red tiles,\r\ncrowned with storks’ nests. It possesses, however, one distinctive\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\nThe largest American college in South-Eastern Europe, outside of\r\nConstantinople, is here. It is conducted by the American missionaries,\r\nand educates most of the Bulgarian teachers employed in the Protestant\r\nschools throughout Bulgaria and Macedonia. It is something more than a\r\ntheological institute; it is also an industrial school, patterned after\r\nthose most successful in the United States, where boys learning trades\r\nmay earn part or all of their tuition. The carpentering department and\r\nthe printing press are both conducted at a profit, which is credited\r\nproportionately to the boys who do the work. In the girls’ school the\r\nduties of home and life are taught, as well as book knowledge, and some\r\nof the young women are trained for the positions of teachers in the\r\nsmaller mission schools.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians owe much to the American missionaries, both directly\r\nand indirectly. For one thing, the Americans have excited, without\r\nintention, the jealousy of the Orthodox Church, which has undoubtedly\r\nassisted in keeping the priests active in developing their own\r\neducational institutions. It was not until the American missionaries\r\nopened a school for girls in their land that the Bulgarians began to\r\neducate their women. But that was many years ago, before Bulgaria\r\nbecame a quasi-independent State; now the State schools afford every\r\nadvantage the Americans can offer--except the American language.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarian Government attempts to administer justice to all\r\ndenominations and to maintain religious equality before the law, and\r\nthe Government comes fairly near to this aim. The Greeks complain that\r\nGreek schools are not subsidised, but Turkish schools are maintained\r\nby the State. It is due to the freedom of religious opinion existing\r\nin Bulgaria that the missionaries have become so closely allied with\r\nthe Bulgarians, for in no other Balkan country, except perhaps Rumania,\r\nis there the same liberty of thought. The Servian Government prohibits\r\nby law all proselytising to Protestantism. The Greeks--though they\r\nwelcomed the aid and sympathy of the missionaries in the Greek war\r\nof independence--have since enacted laws which make the teaching of\r\n‘sacred lessons’ in the schools compulsory, lessons of a character\r\nwhich the missionaries refuse to disseminate. The Sultan would not\r\ntolerate the missionaries in his dominions if they attempted to convert\r\nMohamedans, while the few Turks who have deserted Mohamedanism have\r\nmysteriously disappeared. And it has been found almost impossible to\r\nconvert Jews. So the missionaries are left only the Bulgarians on whom\r\nto work. Their schools and churches are open to other nationalities in\r\nboth Bulgaria and Macedonia; but, for the double reason that they are\r\ninstitutions of Protestants and of Bulgarians, very few of the other\r\nraces ever seek admission.\r\n\r\nBut the Bulgarians do not appreciate the work of the Americans; indeed,\r\nthose who are not converted distinctly rebel against what they term\r\nthe ‘Christianising of Christians.’ I have said that the Government\r\nwas just in religious matters; the members of the Government, however,\r\nare not. Government officials (adherents of the Orthodox Church, or\r\nthey would not be elected) make it difficult for the missionaries to\r\nextend their work, by delaying necessary permits and privileges as\r\nlong as possible; and they favour members of the Orthodox Church in\r\nmaking appointments to public service. The unfortunate missionaries\r\nare, therefore, between the devil and the deep sea; for while the\r\nBulgarians resent being the subject of missions, the Turks accuse the\r\nAmericans of propagating a revolutionary spirit amongst the Bulgars. Of\r\nthe latter, however, they are not directly guilty, though the education\r\nof a peasant naturally tends to fire his spirit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BULGARIAN PEASANTS, SAMAKOV.]\r\n\r\nBut there was one occasion when the American missionaries came to be\r\nimportant instruments of the Macedonian revolutionary cause. This was\r\nin the notorious capture of Miss Ellen M. Stone, a certain feature of\r\nwhich, not correctly chronicled at the time, makes a most interesting\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nEarly in July 1901, a party of Protestant missionaries and\r\nteachers--among whom Miss Stone was the only foreigner--left the\r\nAmerican school at Samakov and crossed the Turkish frontier to\r\nDjuma-bala. From Djuma they proceeded into Macedonia, without an\r\nescort, considering that the party, numbering fifteen, was too large\r\nto be molested. Towards nightfall of the first day out the travellers,\r\ngrowing weary, allowed their ponies to straggle, as the Macedonian\r\npony is wont to do. At dark the cavalcade began to ascend a rugged\r\nmountain in this disorder, and rode directly into an ambush laid for\r\nthe Americans. It was an easy matter for the brigands to ‘round-up’ the\r\nwhole number without firing a single shot. The brigands had no need for\r\nthe other members of the company, being Bulgarians, and sent all of\r\nthem on their way except Mrs. Tsilka, whom they detained as a companion\r\nfor Miss Stone.\r\n\r\nThe sum demanded for Miss Stone’s ransom was twenty-five thousand\r\nTurkish liras, slightly less in value than so many English pounds. The\r\nAmerican Government took no effective measures to secure the release of\r\nits subject, and it was left to the American people to subscribe the\r\nransom money. In a few months the sum of sixty-eight thousand dollars\r\n(fourteen thousand five hundred pounds Turkish) was collected, and the\r\nAmerican Consul-General at Constantinople went to Sofia to negotiate\r\nthe ransom. But in Bulgaria he was annoyed by the people and the press,\r\nand hampered by the Government, and he soon found it impracticable\r\nto pay the money to the brigands from that side of the border. The\r\nOrthodox churchmen had no sympathy for the American evangelist and\r\ntreated the affair as a grand joke, while the Government sought to\r\nprevent payment of the ransom on Bulgarian soil, lest it should be\r\ncalled upon by the United States at a later date to refund the amount.\r\n\r\nAt the end of five months from the time of the capture, the\r\nConsul-General (Mr. Dickenson) had accomplished only an agreement\r\nwith the brigands that Miss Stone should be set at liberty on payment\r\nof the sum collected in lieu of the one demanded, and he returned to\r\nConstantinople and transferred the work to a committee appointed by the\r\nAmerican Minister on instructions from Washington.\r\n\r\nAccording to accounts sent to the newspapers at the time by\r\ncorrespondents who, with many Turkish soldiers, dogged the footsteps\r\nof the three men who formed the ransom committee, these gentlemen,\r\nMessrs. Peet, House, and Garguilo, after travelling over hundreds\r\nof miles of wild mountain roads, doubling on their tracks sometimes\r\ndaily in their search for the brigands, finally despaired of paying\r\nthe ransom in gold, sent the gold back to Constantinople, secured\r\nbank-notes in its stead, and paid two agents of the insurgents in\r\npaper money at a cross road when they (the committee) managed to\r\nescape the vigilance of the Turkish soldiers for a few minutes. But\r\nthe correspondents were sadly duped, for necessity and the committajis\r\ndemanded that they should be placed in the same category as the Turks,\r\nand regarded as dangerous characters.\r\n\r\nIf a member of the committee could tell this tale it would make a\r\nmost readable volume, but the committee is bound by a promise to the\r\ninsurgents to keep secret certain details, and I am able to give only a\r\nbare outline of the adventure.\r\n\r\nI first learned that the original accounts of the ransoming were\r\nerroneous from Mr. Garguilo, whom I met one day at the American\r\nLegation at Constantinople, of which he is the dragoman. He was proud\r\nof having defeated some worthy men among my colleagues and the Turkish\r\npolice at the same time. He told me bits of the story which whetted my\r\ncuriosity, and I resolved to run it to earth.\r\n\r\nBefore I left Constantinople I called on Mr. Peet at his office, the\r\nheadquarters of the American Mission Board, and, in the course of a\r\nconversation about the Stone affair, added a few more facts to those\r\nMr. Garguilo had given me. It was my good fortune, not long after, to\r\nmeet Dr. House at the American mission at Salonica, and I took the\r\nopportunity of discussing the affair with him. And as I proceeded\r\nthrough Macedonia I encountered many others of the principal actors\r\nin the little drama. I came upon Mr. and Mrs. Tsilka at Monastir;\r\nthen the Turkish officer who had been detached to follow the fourteen\r\nthousand five hundred pounds of gold; and later, in Bulgaria, I found a\r\nmember of Sandansky’s band, the band which had captured Miss Stone. The\r\nbrigand was the most communicative of all these principals, and I got\r\nfrom him some details which the ransom committee had been sworn not to\r\ndivulge, for fear lest punishment should be meted out by the Turks to\r\nthe town which played the important part in the delivery of the ransom.\r\n\r\nOn Mr. Dickenson’s return from Sofia the ransom committee left at once\r\nfor the Raslog district. The brigands at this juncture had become\r\nindignant at the long delay in the payment of the money and had\r\nbroken off negotiations with the Americans. The first work of the new\r\ncommittee, then, was to re-establish communication with the insurgents,\r\nand, in order to let the brigands learn that they were on their trail,\r\nthe news of the fact was disseminated broadcast throughout Bulgaria and\r\nMacedonia, and also sent to the European press, which the revolutionary\r\norganisation follows closely. This eventually accomplished the desired\r\neffect, but also caused an increase of the number of correspondents on\r\nthe trail of the committee.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a month the committee moved from town to town through the\r\nsnow--for it was now winter--faring on the coarsest of food, sleeping\r\nin comfortless khans and undergoing many hardships, but meeting with\r\nno success. Trail after trail drew blank. On one occasion word came\r\nthat two frontier smugglers, captured by the Turks, had professed to\r\nhaving seen Miss Stone and Mrs. Tsilka’s baby strangled, and could\r\ntake the committee to the graves! There had been several other reports\r\nthat the brigands had wearied of waiting for the ransom and had killed\r\ntheir captives, but none so detailed as this. The Turkish authorities\r\nat the point from which this evidence came were anxiously petitioned\r\nfor further facts. Another examination of the smugglers was made, and\r\nthe following day a telegram announced that they were altering their\r\ntestimony. ‘The alterations’ completely denied the first statement,\r\nwithout even an excuse on the part of the smugglers for having\r\nconcocted it. It seems the Turks had asked them for information of\r\nMiss Stone, and the frightened smugglers had replied in the Macedonian\r\nmanner, according to what they thought their questioners desired to\r\nhear.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the committee broke up, Messrs. Peet and Garguilo\r\nestablishing themselves at Djuma-bala and Dr. House going to Bansko,\r\nthe most rebellious town of a most rebellious district, ‘to conduct\r\na series of missionary meetings.’ Dr. House was the only member of\r\nthe committee who could speak Bulgarian and converse direct with the\r\nbrigands, and his action was severely criticised by the correspondents.\r\nAs the journalists saw the case, here was a member of the committee,\r\nthe most valuable man because of his knowledge of the brigands’\r\nlanguage, wasting valuable time preaching Christianity to Christians,\r\njust when his every effort should be devoted to the task of freeing\r\nthe two unfortunate women and a new-born babe, who were suffering\r\nuntold tortures in some sheepfold high in the snow-covered mountains.\r\nBut the correspondents were not aware that Dr. House had escaped\r\ntheir vigilance and that of the Turks, and, under the guidance of an\r\ninsurgent disguised as an ordinary peasant, had visited a delegation of\r\nthe brigands; nor did they know that further negotiations for paying\r\nthe ransom were proceeding along with the revival meetings at Bansko.\r\n\r\nAfter Dr. House had got into touch with the brigands the money was\r\nsent for. Mr. Smyth-Lyte, of the American Consulate, conveyed it from\r\nConstantinople. Two cases, containing fourteen thousand five hundred\r\ngold pieces and weighing four hundred pounds, were delivered to him\r\nfrom the Ottoman Bank, where the ransom fund had been deposited. The\r\nbullion was sent under proper guard to the railway station, where a\r\nspecial car was awaiting it. Two kavasses were sent with Mr. Smyth-Lyte\r\nfrom the bank, and these bodyguards always slept on the money. At\r\nDemir-Hissar, where the train journey ended, Mr. Smyth-Lyte was met\r\nby a Turkish officer, who informed him, in polished French, that he\r\n(the officer) was the humble servant of Monsieur the Consul, for whom\r\nthe Padisha had the greatest concern. Monsieur’s commands, he added,\r\nwould be fulfilled even to the death of the officer and twenty trusty\r\ntroopers who were under his command. The Turk was suave and smartly\r\ndressed, and the trusty troopers non-communicative and very ragged.\r\n\r\nA rickety brougham was ready to take the American and the money to\r\nDjuma-bala, a two days’ journey. The two packages of gold were loaded\r\ninto the doubtful conveyance, the troopers formed a cordon about it,\r\nand the journey was begun. But the party had hardly got fairly upon the\r\nroad when the severe pounding of the gold as the carriage bumped over\r\nthe rocks, carried away the floor, and down went the boxes. There was\r\na halt and an attempt to patch up the vehicle, but it was useless. One\r\nof the pack-horses accompanying the soldiers was unloaded and the gold\r\nstrapped on its back; but the packages were of unequal sizes, and would\r\npersist in finding their way under the stomach of the hapless brute. At\r\nlast the two kavasses, who were well mounted, were each called upon to\r\ncarry a box, and in this way the money was got over the mountains.\r\n\r\nMore troops fell in as the way became more dangerous, until the number\r\nof the escort reached a hundred. Some of the cavalry men went far\r\nahead to scout, especially through the great Kresna Pass, where a\r\nhandful of men could ambush an army; and others dropped back far behind\r\nthe cavalcade to cover the rear. But the journey was made without\r\nmishap, and late at night of the second day, Mr. Smyth-Lyte arrived at\r\nDjuma-bala, met there Messrs. Peet and Garguilo, and delivered over his\r\nprecious charge. Early next morning he set off on the return trip with\r\nhis kavasses and a guard of half a dozen men.[1]\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the money at Djuma there was a general concentration\r\nof correspondents, Turkish soldiers, and spies about it. The committee\r\nwas no longer the subject of attention; the money was now the thing.\r\nIf they kept close to the money, reasoned the correspondents and the\r\nsoldiers, they were bound to be in at the ransom. The correspondents\r\nhad no other interest than to get the news, but the soldiers were bent\r\non getting the brigands. The Turkish Government had no idea of allowing\r\nthe bandits to reap their golden harvest.\r\n\r\nSo it came to be the task of the ransoming committee to separate the\r\ngold from the correspondents and the soldiers, apparently a hopeless\r\none. Every correspondent present was a man of sharp wits and almost\r\nuntiring energy. Each of them had a dragoman always watching the Turks\r\nwho surrounded the gold. The Turkish spies kept their eyes on the\r\nsoldiers, the committee, and the correspondents alike.\r\n\r\nThe committee would decide at a moment’s notice to leave a town for a\r\nvisit to some mountain village, telling no one; but the soldiers were\r\nalways with them, ostensibly guarding them from other brigands, and the\r\ntireless correspondents were on their track before the dust had settled\r\nbehind their horses.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Messrs. Peet and Garguilo, bringing the money, came to\r\nBansko and there settled down with Dr. House, who was still preaching\r\nto the Bulgarians. The committee secured a private house to live in,\r\nand in one room stored the gold. Here a long rest took place. The\r\ncorrespondents railed against the committee, accusing it of laziness\r\nand love of comfort; but they, too, grew indolent and took their\r\nease at their khan. At first they, with the Turks, dogged the very\r\nfootsteps of the three men of the committee, but after a week of this\r\nthey grew weary, for the ransoming committee were wont to walk far\r\ndaily ‘for exercise,’ and loiter aimlessly on cold and unattractive\r\nmountain roads about the town. It was not probable that the brigands\r\nwould venture very near to a village so heavily garrisoned and\r\npatrolled as was Bansko, and to watch the gold soon became sufficient\r\nfor the correspondents. Had any of them put himself to the trouble of\r\nascertaining what Mr. Garguilo’s habits were when comfortably ensconced\r\nat the Embassy at Constantinople, he would have discovered that any\r\nexertion whatever is distinctly foreign to that gentleman’s daily\r\nroutine.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a month, to the intense surprise of everybody, a\r\nmessenger came from Constantinople, travelling in all the state\r\nwhich had dignified Mr. Smyth-Lyte’s journey. With great ceremony the\r\ntwo boxes of gold were delivered to him. There was no mistake about\r\nthem; they were the same two boxes. They were still bound tight with\r\niron bands and they still weighed four hundred pounds. One hundred\r\nsoldiers escorted them back to Demir-Hissar. There they were carefully\r\nplaced aboard another special car, and two kavasses ate and slept on\r\nthem until they were safely delivered back to the Ottoman Bank at\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nA few days later the committee started on its return to the railway,\r\nwith a small escort and only one correspondent. The others considered\r\nthat for the present the affair was over.\r\n\r\nAt one place on the route Mr. Garguilo and Dr. House managed to leave\r\ntheir escort and the correspondent a little behind. The soldiers and\r\nthe correspondents had lost interest now. At a cross-road they stopped\r\nand waited for their trackers. When the correspondent came up Mr.\r\nGarguilo told him that ‘the deed was done.’\r\n\r\nOn the ground there were several torn envelopes, such as a bank would\r\nuse to cover notes. A few days later Miss Stone, Mrs. Tsilka, and the\r\nbaby were ‘discovered,’ in a village near Seres. Two of the committee\r\nmet and escorted them to Salonica.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious how the story that the money was paid in paper came to\r\nappear in the English and American press; but the money was not paid in\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nWhen Messrs. Garguilo, Peet, and House took their daily walks about\r\nBansko they went out with heavy packages of gold concealed under\r\ntheir coats, and they returned with a like weight--but not of gold!\r\nEach night they removed a certain amount of the money, and on their\r\nreturn would place the lead in the bullion boxes--the vigilant guards\r\nabout the house all unconscious that the gold was going. Finally,\r\nthe fourteen thousand five hundred pieces had been delivered to the\r\nbrigands, whom the committee-men met on their walks, and four hundred\r\npounds of lead filled the boxes.\r\n\r\nThe return of the boxes to Constantinople with all the pomp and\r\nceremony attendant upon the transport of treasure was not without an\r\nobject. It was necessary to keep the fact that the ransom had been\r\nhanded over a complete secret until the captives were released, in\r\norder that the Turks should not get on the track of the brigands. A\r\npromise that every effort should be made to throw the Turks off the\r\ntrail was demanded by the brigands, as was an injunction of absolute\r\nsecrecy concerning also the place and manner in which the money was\r\npaid.\r\n\r\nBut the time is past when the secret need be kept, and the brigands,\r\nnow off duty between revolutions, are spinning this yarn, along with\r\naccounts of other adventures, to admiring friends in Sofia.\r\n\r\nThe money which the revolutionary organisation secured by this capture\r\nwent a long way, I am told, in preparing the uprising of 1903. The\r\ninsurgents say that they expected the Government of the United States\r\nto exact from the Sultan the price of this ransom, thereby making the\r\nPadisha pay for the arms used against himself. But this has not been\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe went to prayer meeting at Samakov at the invitation of the American\r\nmissionaries, and took with us several officers of the garrison.\r\nThe missionaries prayed fervently and at length that the Macedonian\r\ninsurgents might be turned from their wicked ways. The prayer annoyed\r\none of the officers, and, to my embarrassment, he rose and stalked\r\nout of the chapel. The others agreed with the missionaries--to a very\r\nlimited extent--that the measures of the committajis were ‘often too\r\ndrastic.’\r\n\r\nThe entire Bulgarian army is in sympathy with the work of the\r\ninsurgents, and not the least enthusiastic with ‘the cause’ is the\r\nlittle mountain battery at Samakov. It is proud of the short cannon,\r\ncarried in three parts on the backs of pack-ponies, and it is proud\r\nof its proficiency at handling them. The entire battery got out one\r\nmorning and took us up into the mountains to show us how the guns\r\nworked. The Bulgarian army has been preparing for many years to fight\r\nthe Turks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BULGARIAN INFANTRY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSOFIA AND THE BULGARIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe drove back to Sofia in a small victoria drawn by four white ponies\r\nwith blue beads around their necks and a diamond-shaped spot of henna\r\non each forehead. Patriotism was running high in the country at\r\nthe time, but the Bulgarian colours are red, white, and green. The\r\ndecorations were in deference to the ‘Evil Eye.’\r\n\r\nWe came down the long valley to Sofia and entered the town at twilight,\r\nmaking our way to the Grand Hôtel de Bulgarie. The shops grew from\r\npeasant establishments where cheese and onions and odd shapes of bread\r\nwere spread on open counters, to emporiums where French gloves and silk\r\nhats were on sale. Electric cars became numerous, double lines crossing\r\neach other at one corner. Here a sturdy gendarme raised his hand for us\r\nto stop; he was not as large as a London policeman, but he carried a\r\nsabre at his side. The chief of police explained to me later that the\r\nweapon was not for use, but simply to impress the other peasants, who\r\nwould have no respect for the brown uniform alone.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the main street we came to a solid drab-coloured,\r\nrectangular building, surrounded by high, drab-coloured walls. The\r\nmassive iron gates were wide open, and before each paced two sentinels.\r\nThis was the palace of the Prince. Just beyond the palace was the hotel.\r\n\r\nSeveral army officers in uniform were standing before the Bulgarie as\r\nwe drove up, and one hailed me in this familiar manner:\r\n\r\n‘Well, how goes it? I see you are from “the land of the free and the\r\nbrave.”’\r\n\r\nHe knew who I was; strangers are conspicuous in Sofia, and their\r\npresence becomes known quickly. There was to be a military ball at\r\nthe officers’ club that evening, and I was invited forthwith. The\r\n‘American,’ as this officer was called, waited at the hotel until I had\r\ndressed, and, after dining with me, took me to the dance.\r\n\r\nThe scene was very like that at a military hop in any civilised\r\ncountry. The officers looked martial in their simple Russian uniforms,\r\nand the ladies were tastefully but modestly dressed. There is no wealth\r\nin Bulgaria--not a millionaire in pounds in all the land--and the\r\nofficers of the army live on their pay. Many members of the Government\r\nand other state officials were at the ball, wearing ordinary evening\r\ndress with some few decorations.\r\n\r\nIt is said of the Bulgarians that they dislike foreigners, which is\r\ntrue to an extent. Their attention to me on this occasion is to be\r\naccounted for in the observation of an historian, that they are ‘a\r\npractical people and their gratitude is chiefly a sense of favours\r\nto come.’ I was the special correspondent of an important newspaper,\r\nand they were anxious that I should sympathise with their cause. They\r\nadopted no surreptitious means of making me do so; they went straight\r\nto the point and demanded my attitude. I intimated that I had come out\r\nto the Balkans to take nobody’s side; I had come ignorant even of the\r\ngeography of South-Eastern Europe, and intended to withhold my judgment\r\nuntil I had seen the question from more sides than one. They granted\r\nthat this was fair, and remarked that an honest man who was not a fool\r\nmust perforce become a bitter partisan on the Balkan question.\r\n\r\nThe day before my departure from Sofia (on this first occasion) I\r\nexcited the suspicions of a local journalist by declining to declare\r\nmy sympathies. The reporter intimated that in his opinion a newspaper\r\nlike mine would hardly send on such a mission a man who was quite as\r\nignorant as I professed to be! They are bold, these Bulgars.\r\n\r\nThis journalist was my undoing. I did not see what he wrote about\r\nme until I returned to Sofia, a few weeks later, and found myself\r\ncompletely ignored by the very Bulgars who had been most attentive.\r\nOfficers who had toasted me when I started for the frontier would not\r\nreturn my salute; newspaper men who had interviewed me now slunk by\r\nin the street, and statesmen and politicians barely nodded when I\r\nlifted my hat. This was undoubtedly deliberate; the Bulgarians could\r\nnot have forgotten me so soon. I sought my friend the officer who spoke\r\nAmerican, and inquired of him if he knew in what way I had offended his\r\nfellow-countrymen. He did not hesitate a minute. The _Vitcherna Posta_,\r\nhe informed me, had shown me up. The paper had discovered that I had\r\ncome out to the Balkans pledged to support the Turks, and my pretended\r\nignorance was simply a bluff. The proprietor of my paper, who would\r\nprobably condemn another man for accepting a monetary bribe, had been\r\nbought with a paltry decoration from his Sultanic Majesty. No news but\r\nsuch as was favourable to the Turk and hostile to the Bulgar would be\r\npublished in my paper. In proof of this statement the ‘Vampire Post’\r\ncalled attention to the fact that I had paid frequent visits to the\r\nTurkish Agency before my late departure.\r\n\r\nThe young officer did not tell me this in the offensive manner of a\r\ncandid friend; he delivered the accusations straight from the shoulder,\r\nand on concluding offered me a native drink, as if I could have no\r\nmitigating argument; he was satisfied of my guilt, but when he was in\r\nAmerica my countrymen had treated him well.\r\n\r\n‘The Bulgarians are not very politic,’ I observed; to which the officer\r\nassented and signed to me to drink, implying by a gesture: this\r\ndisagreeable explanation is over, but you are my guest.\r\n\r\nThe Sofia journal had mistaken me; I was not the correspondent of\r\nthe paper whose proprietor had been decorated by the Sultan. Nor were\r\nthe numerous visits I had paid to the Turkish Commissioner due to any\r\nbut legitimate reasons. The Sultan’s representative, indeed, accused\r\nme of making a suspicious number of calls on Bulgarian officials and\r\nof receiving too many revolutionists at my hotel; and when I applied\r\nto him for permission to proceed to Macedonia I found many visits and\r\nmuch persuasion all of no avail. He had an antidote prepared for me, an\r\nimmediate trip to Constantinople, where the diplomatic atmosphere is\r\nsympathetic with the Sultan. Thus, by trying to maintain the friendship\r\nof both Bulgar and Turk, I had incurred, at the very outset of my\r\nmission, the hostility of both.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians are suspicious people. They excuse this trait in\r\ntheir character by explaining that they lived under the Mohamedan\r\nfor five hundred years. This is their favourite excuse for all their\r\nsins. But they have also acquired at least one of the Turk’s good\r\npoints; they are dignified and can control themselves; they seldom\r\nlose their tempers and generally act cautiously. They are somewhat\r\nobstinate, which is a Slav characteristic, and this, with a childlike\r\nsensitiveness due to their youth as a nation, makes for pride.\r\n\r\nAn Englishman who spends any length of time among the Bulgarians\r\ngenerally likes them. The strong strain of barbarism in the Bulgar\r\nfinds sympathy in the breast of the Britisher, and the Bulgar’s\r\nrespect for the ultra-civilised chord in the other man also wins its\r\nreward. The Bulgar never approaches an Englishman, who, he knows,\r\nresents approach; he never becomes friendly, fearing a rebuff; and he\r\nmaintains for ever a dignity and distance in the presence of the stony\r\none. Now, the Bulgar doesn’t know it, but this is exactly the way to\r\ngain the esteem of the Englishman, who recognises a diamond in the man\r\nwho can cut him.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians are most anxious for the favour of Great Britain. They\r\naspire to become a great nation and to annex the conquerable territory\r\nto their south. They see that their friends, if they have any, are the\r\nWestern Powers, and not Austria and Russia; and ‘their gratitude is\r\nchiefly a sense of favours to come.’\r\n\r\nWhen a voivoda is killed in Macedonia a high mass for the repose of\r\nhis soul is celebrated the next Sunday or fête day at the cathedral in\r\nSofia. Small boys, hired by the revolutionary committee, hold crayon\r\nportraits of the dead heroes, draped in mourning, for the people to see\r\nas they enter church. After mass the congregation gathers in the vast\r\nopen space before the cathedral to hear addresses by members of the\r\nrevolutionary committee, who sometimes speak from the cathedral steps.\r\nThe speeches are generally quite sane, often contain advice to foster\r\nBritish friendship, but never suggest the release of Russia’s hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL, SOFIA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRITISH AGENCY, SOFIA: A DEMONSTRATION.]\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of one of these meetings I accompanied a crowd\r\nto the British Agency. On their way they passed the Italian Agency,\r\nhalted, and gave three cheers. In front of the Lion and the Unicorn the\r\nshouts were loud and prolonged. A silence followed, and they waited\r\nfor an acknowledgment. But, of course, his Majesty’s representative\r\ncould not acknowledge a demonstration hostile to Turkey, a State with\r\nwhich the British Government was at peace. The Bulgarians finally\r\nmoved off, and made for the residence of the Russian. There, the crowd\r\nseemed undecided; some were for cheering and passing on, others were\r\nbent on seeing M. Bakhmetieff. The Russian, unlike the English agent,\r\nresponded promptly, and spoke from his terrace in his own tongue--which\r\nis sufficiently like Bulgarian to be understood by a Bulgarian crowd.\r\nHe told them that Bulgaria must bide Russia’s time, that Russia was the\r\nfriend of all Slavs, and Russia would eventually come to their aid.\r\n\r\nBulgarians of intelligence and education put little faith in the\r\npromises of the present Russian Government. But Russia holds a fast\r\ngrip on the masses of the people; the peasants are grateful for their\r\ndeliverance, and many of the politicians are open to bribery.\r\n\r\nBut the model of the Bulgarians is by no means the great Slav country.\r\nThey can boast of having attained in a quarter of a century a liberty\r\nwhich the Russians have not yet secured. The institutions of Bulgaria\r\nare liberal in principle, and often in practice; the constitution is\r\ndemocratic. The suffrage is extended to every male adult, as a result\r\nwhereof seven Turks represent the Mohamedan districts of the Danube\r\nand Turkish border in the Sobranjé, and sit among the other deputies\r\nwithout removing their fezzes.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians are anxious to be classed with people of the West, and\r\nthey strive hard for civilisation, though a streak of Eastern origin\r\nsometimes displays itself. Once I was asked a significant question by a\r\nboy who had spent several years at an American mission school.\r\n\r\n‘The English papers,’ he said, ‘often assert that we are not civilised.\r\nWill you tell me what constitutes a state of civilisation?’\r\n\r\nI hesitated.\r\n\r\n‘Is it a man’s education?’ he asked. ‘It is not our fault if we have\r\nnot education; we are learning as fast as we can. It cannot be that\r\nclothes make the man. It may be the result of your religion; but I\r\nwonder if England is more religious on the whole than Bulgaria is.\r\nWe hear of horrible social crimes there that never occur here. And\r\nour politics is no more corrupt than that of America, which sends\r\nus missionaries. We are accused of having national jealousies and\r\nambitions. England is certainly not free from the former, and if she\r\nis no longer ambitious, it is simply because her aspirations are all\r\nachieved.’\r\n\r\nI was unable to define civilisation.\r\n\r\nWhen Bulgaria became independent, Sofia was a very dirty town, without\r\na street paved with anything but cobble stones, and with but one house\r\nof any pretensions, the Turkish ‘konak.’ To-day, besides a palace and\r\na parliamentary building, there are a national bank, a post office,\r\na military academy, several vast barracks, and many other Government\r\nbuildings. There are parks and public gardens where bands play on\r\nsummer evenings; new streets and avenues have been laid out, and some\r\nof the narrow ones of Turkish times have been widened; substantial\r\nshops and hotels mark the business quarter, and modern homes the\r\navenues. Still, Sofia reminds one of a lanky girl whose spindle shanks\r\nand lean arms have outgrown her pinafore. The dwellings, by setting far\r\napart, try to reach out the long new avenues and cover the gawky child,\r\nbut in places she is absolutely bare.\r\n\r\nOne day I drove out along one of the avenues to call on a Cabinet\r\nMinister. The coachman drew up at a modest cottage, whose greatest\r\ncharm was an ample garden. I repeated the name of the Minister, and\r\nlooked dubiously at the coachman.\r\n\r\n‘Touka, touka’ (‘here, here’), he said, so I entered.\r\n\r\nA little girl, the Minister’s daughter, responded to my rap and invited\r\nme in. The servant was cooking.\r\n\r\nNot far from here were the humble homes of two painters and a sculptor,\r\nupon whom I often called. They were instructors at the National\r\nInstitute of Art, of which Ivan Markvitchka is the head.\r\n\r\nBut the streets of Sofia have not altogether parted with the past;\r\nthere are many touches of the old Turkish times left. Many of the\r\nshops are dark, low, and dingy, though the shopkeepers no longer block\r\nthe pavements with their wares and sit cross-legged among them. An\r\nancient Turkish bath and an old mosque stand side by side in front\r\nof the market place on the principal trading corner. The bath is not\r\nattractive in appearance, but the water is excellent--brought by\r\npipe from a boiling mineral spring in the mountains a few kilometres\r\ndistant. The place is closed to the public on Mondays, when the\r\ngarrison of Sofia is scrubbed. Detachments of a hundred men arrive\r\nhourly, each with a towel and a bar of brown soap; three-quarters of an\r\nhour later they are turned out clean.\r\n\r\nCompulsory service in the army has been a great training to the\r\nBulgarian peasants. The natives of Macedonia bathe as they marry, only\r\nonce or twice in a lifetime. A child is not washed when it is born for\r\nfear of its catching cold, nor when it is baptized, for oil is used at\r\nthis ceremony.\r\n\r\nAn open letter from a Greek priest to the American missionaries\r\nconcerning the use of oil instead of water at the baptismal office,\r\ndemonstrates the Macedonian prejudice against water--except for\r\ninternal use. The priest defended the use of oil on the score that, as\r\na result of oiled christening, the Macedonian peasants, though they\r\nnever wash, carry with them no foul odour, as do peasants baptized with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VIEW OF SOFIA: VITOSH IN THE BACKGROUND.]\r\n\r\nBehind the mosque and the bath is an open space which resembles an\r\nempty lot, except on Fridays. Friday is both the sabbath of the\r\nTurks and the market day of the Bulgars, but the police are never\r\ncalled upon to prevent a clash between the two. Once a week the capital\r\nis crowded with peasants assembled from every village within a radius\r\nof twenty kilometres. Fellow-residents of the same broad, sunny plain\r\nin which Sofia lies come trooping in, clad in lighter clothes than\r\nthose worn by the mountain men from Vitosh. They begin to gather on\r\nThursday evening, and long before the next day breaks the space is\r\ncovered with sacks of corn, strings of onions, bunches of chickens,\r\nbaskets of eggs, buckets of cheese, bolts of homespun cloth, bleating\r\nlambs, and squealing pigs.\r\n\r\nThe peasants, young and old, men and women, walk to market. Only pigs\r\nand babies are carried. The carts and the pack-animals are too heavily\r\nladen to carry their owners; and, besides, every individual afoot\r\ncan carry something more. One sympathises with a pretty girl dressed\r\nin holiday costume, a red rose in her hair, carrying a pig over one\r\nshoulder, over the other a dozen chickens strung up by the feet. One\r\nsympathises with the pig and the fowls also, for these poor things have\r\nbeen carried with their heads hanging for probably three hours. The pig\r\nis slung by one or both hind legs, with a lash tied so tightly that\r\nit entirely stops the circulation, and may cut through the flesh to\r\nthe bone. The girls always laugh on their way to market, and the pigs\r\nalways cry. Of course the pigs are laid down now and again along the\r\nroute, when the happy girls take a rest, but they arrive in Sofia with\r\ntheir eyes popping out of the sockets. These pigs which the girls carry\r\nare little pigs, but huge hogs are hung in the same manner at the sides\r\nof laden ponies.\r\n\r\nOn various occasions I pointed out this wanton cruelty to prominent\r\nBulgarians whom I knew, and generally got some reply about the five\r\nhundred years the peasants had spent under the Turks. Where was the boy\r\nwho asked me what the English word civilised meant?\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians are careful of their draught animals. This, perhaps,\r\nthey have learned in their term of subjection to the Mohamedan. It\r\nis a common sight in summer to see a girl in holiday attire, with\r\na long-handled dipper throwing water from a puddle on to the backs\r\nof sweltering buffaloes as they move slowly past, dragging a heavy,\r\ncreaking cart. In the winter each buffalo has his blanket.\r\n\r\nThe peasant girl weaves the cloth for her own clothes, spins the\r\nthreads on her long marches to town, and saves her earnings for brass\r\nbelt-buckles, bracelets, and other ornaments. Her bracelets often\r\nweigh over a pound, and her belt-buckle sometimes measures ten inches\r\nacross. Her hair is far below her waist, but it generally changes in\r\nboth texture and colour considerably above. The lower portion resembles\r\nhorsehair. When such an appendage is spliced on to the maiden’s own\r\nlocks, the proud possessor spends hours making the combination into a\r\nscore of thin plaits, which she spreads out across her shoulders and\r\nloops together at the end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE MARKET PLACE, SOFIA.]\r\n\r\nThe bazaars of other capitals in the Near East are filled with cheap\r\nGerman and Austrian imitations of native jewellery and dress, but Sofia\r\nis freer from this pollution.\r\n\r\nThere are few Jews in Bulgaria as compared with the number in the\r\nborder State of Rumania; the Jews cannot thrive on the close-fisted\r\nBulgars. The Jews who live among them are fairer in business\r\ntransactions than their co-religionists anywhere else in the Balkans.\r\nI had an interesting experience with an old Israelite one day. He was\r\nselling key-rings, among other trinkets, on the market place, and I\r\nstopped and took one. I held up a franc by way of asking the price,\r\nand he said, ‘Franc,’ and held up one finger. The ring was a common\r\naffair and not worth so much, but I needed one badly, and, being unable\r\nto argue over the price, I gave up the franc and proceeded to adjust\r\nmy keys to the ring. The old Jew was embarrassed. He had clearly\r\nexpected me to bargain with him. He looked at the franc and then at\r\nme, undecided whether to do the honest thing or pocket the piece. As I\r\nstarted away he touched me on the arm, drew a greasy old purse from a\r\ndeep pocket in a baggy pair of trousers, and finding a fifty-centime\r\npiece, pressed it upon me.\r\n\r\nBut while the Jew who has elected to remain among the Bulgars\r\nhas had to surrender some of his principles of gold-getting, the\r\nBulgar at horse-trading is a brother of the world fraternity of\r\nstock-dealers. One bright market day, when the streets were crowded\r\nwith peasants and the European garb was almost obliterated, I went with\r\na fellow-correspondent to buy a horse. We were not long in finding a\r\nsatisfactory animal, but the bargaining was a tedious process. The\r\nowner of the horse was a simple old peasant, but he was assisted in the\r\ndeal by the mayor of his village, an independent person of some thirty\r\nyears, dressed like the other in homespuns and sheepskins.\r\n\r\nThe old peasant gripped the bridle of his horse as if someone were\r\ntrying to rob him of the animal, and followed the very words of the\r\ndeal as they passed from one man to the other. After a long wrangle a\r\nprice was finally agreed upon, and the money was produced in the form\r\nof Bulgarian bank-notes.\r\n\r\nA gleam of joy came over the old man’s face when the currency was first\r\nlaid in his hands, but it died away almost instantly, giving place to\r\none of hopeless bewilderment; he could not count so much money. He\r\nasked my friend if he was not swindling him, and then he asked the\r\nmayor, and again and again they each counted the notes over. It was\r\npitiable. He said he had received many pieces of paper from Turkish\r\n‘effendi,’ and they were never worth anything (the Turkish army has a\r\nway of giving paper promises for goods and labour).\r\n\r\n‘You are no longer a Turkish subject,’ said the mayor.\r\n\r\nHe finally loosened his grip on the bridle, but as he delivered over\r\nthe animal a last pang of fear struck his heart, and he turned hastily\r\nabout in search of something. Spying me at a little distance off, he\r\ncame shuffling towards me as fast as his old legs would carry him. I\r\nhad left the scene and gone over to inspect the buffaloes lying quietly\r\ncovered with their masters’ coats of goats’ hair. The old peasant made\r\nhis way among the beasts to where I was, and thrust the roll of bills\r\nat me, pleading something in Bulgarian. The mayor shouted to him that I\r\ndid not understand Bulgarian; but I understood the old man, and tried\r\nto put his mind at ease as to whether he possessed three hundred good\r\ngold francs.\r\n\r\nThe older peasants of Bulgaria are nearly all illiterate, but State\r\nschools teach the younger generations to read and write. Many of the\r\nolder inhabitants understand the Turkish language; the younger Bulgars\r\nare learning French.\r\n\r\nThey are building a national opera-house in Sofia, and strangers are\r\nalways taken to see the work. At present there is only one playhouse\r\nin the town, a Turkish theatre. One evening I was invited by Boris\r\nSarafoff, the Macedonian leader, to be one of a box party to witness a\r\nperformance at this place. It was during the war in the Far East, and\r\nthe other guests of the insurgent were a Japanese and a Russian who\r\nhappened to be in Sofia at the time. Gathered from the four corners of\r\nthe earth, it was natural that no two of us thoroughly agreed on any\r\none point, but each was tolerant of the others. As for Sarafoff, more\r\nanon; here, ‘the play’s the thing.’\r\n\r\nOur box cost the sum of five francs; it was the best in the house with\r\nthe exception of the royal box. There were seats to be had for twenty\r\nand standing room for ten centimes. The building was a rough wooden\r\nbarn, rather rickety, whitewashed inside. From the single gallery hung\r\nhand-painted works of art only equalled by the mural decorations at\r\nRilo. The pictures were grotesque and ludicrous. They portrayed the\r\nabsurdities of the Turk, his peculiar way of doing things, and his\r\nchronic inclination to rest. The band, which vied with the pictures\r\nin keeping early arrivals in good humour until the curtain rose,\r\nwas composed of a fair young lady who beat the drum, a bald bass\r\nviolinist, a stout matron who blew the cornet, and two or three normal\r\nmusicians--all led by a youth of not more than fifteen. The work of\r\nthe band, however, was more artistic than that of the painter, which\r\nwas well for it, because the music was not included in the price of\r\nadmission. When the play began the beauty who beat the drum left her\r\ninstrument to pass a plate among the audience in the same manner that a\r\ncollection is taken in church. But this was not the only collection to\r\nbe made. Between the acts the actresses appeared by turns in the house.\r\nAfter the band the leading lady had first draught on the audience. The\r\nlady who simply walked on got the last pull--and got what she deserved.\r\n\r\nThe plays presented at the Turkish theatre are all comedies. The\r\nlanguage employed is Turkish; the principal characters are Turks;\r\nthe actors are Armenians. The leading man is a splendid actor. His\r\nimpersonation of a Turkish pasha, with all that functionary’s suspicion\r\nand corruption, was done with such extravagance, and yet such delicacy,\r\nthat the Jap, the Russian, and myself, as well as Sarafoff, were highly\r\namused.\r\n\r\nThe Turk is the subject of much of the Bulgarian’s humour as well as\r\nhis wrath. He is to the Bulgar very much what the Irishman is to the\r\nEnglishman, the funny as well as the exasperating man. The Bulgarian\r\npeasants are usually on the best of terms with the Turks in their land.\r\nThey generally treat them with fairness and consideration. But on\r\noccasions insurgent bands which have met with defeat across the border\r\nhave avenged themselves on Mohamedans in Bulgaria. But such slaughters\r\nhappen with less and less frequency, and on an ever-diminishing scale.\r\nExcept for individual slaughters, none has taken place for more than\r\nten years. The Government is jealous of its case against the Turk, and\r\nhas been most zealous in its efforts to prevent murders of Mohamedans\r\never since the day Prince Alexander, on ascending the new throne,\r\nvisited the mosque of Sofia in token of respect for the religion of his\r\nTurkish subjects. On the whole, the Mohamedan in Bulgaria is better off\r\nthan his brother in Turkey, who, except that he holds the position of\r\nthe man with the gun, suffers under the Ottoman rule almost or quite\r\nas much as does the Christian. Nevertheless, there is a continuous\r\nexodus from Bulgaria of Turks and Pomaks (Bulgarians converted to\r\nMohamedanism) to the land where the Mohamedan rules. And when these\r\nTurks pack their goods and chattels and start to trek, they do not stop\r\nuntil they have passed beyond the Bosphorus. They seem to think--as\r\nmany men have thought for many years--that the day of Turkish power in\r\nEurope will soon be past.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Bulgaria is a shrewd monarch, but he is not much loved.\r\nThere are parties which think Prince Ferdinand too subservient to the\r\nRussian Government, and parties which think him too independent of the\r\nCzar; parties which think him ambitious, and say that he would be a\r\nking, and still others which say he cares too little for the man in\r\nthe sheepskin coat to risk his princely crown in a military venture.\r\nI went down, by special invitation, on a private train, to see his\r\nHighness cut the ribbon that stretched across the newly finished port\r\nof Bourgas. After the cannon had signalled the fact that the harbour\r\nwas open to the commerce of the world, Prince Ferdinand turned from\r\nthe end of the pier and strode back towards the shore, shaking hands\r\nand chatting a moment, with, as I thought, everybody. When he came\r\nto me I extended my hand as I would to Mr. Roosevelt, but the Prince\r\nstood still and fixed me with a withering glare. Another correspondent\r\nacquainted with us both came to the rescue and presented me to the\r\nPrince. The Prince mustered his English, which he said he had not\r\nemployed for many a year, and conversed with me in my own tongue for\r\nquite five minutes. But he did not apologise for his rudeness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCONSTANTINOPLE AND THE TURKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Count could claim no country. Both Russia and Bulgaria denied him;\r\nand the man without a passport is contraband in Turkey. My pockets\r\nwere full of smaller articles of the forbidden class, and my shirt was\r\npacked like a life-preserver. Austrian military maps and weighty books\r\non the Balkans, a Colt’s and cartridges, and many rolls of kodak film,\r\nwhich might be taken for sticks of dynamite--these things puffed up my\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nThe Customs inspectors entered the train at Mustafa Pasha, and,\r\nperceiving my plight, subjected the baggage to a scandalous search.\r\nThey turned out every bag, ran their hands into the shoes, undid the\r\nballs of socks, and even lifted the linings of an extra hat; but all\r\nthey found was a Bulgarian art journal containing a few pictures. As\r\nI replaced my mauled garments one of these fiends poked his fezzed\r\nhead into my compartment again. He handed back the Bulgarian journal,\r\nsaying, with approval, ‘Allemand, monsieur.’ The magazine was printed\r\nin German.\r\n\r\nStrange things are contraband in Turkey--salt, because there is\r\nmonopoly in the land; firearms, though they are sold openly in the\r\nstreets; novels such as the ‘Swiss Family Robinson,’ because the\r\ndog is named Turk; dictionaries containing the words ‘elder’ and\r\n‘brother,’ as Abdul Hamid usurped the throne from his elder brother;\r\nand works of chemistry containing the term H_{2}O, which could but mean\r\nHamid-Second-Zero.\r\n\r\nAnother baggage inspection takes place at Constantinople, but this is\r\nonly for the purpose of extorting backsheesh. I paid a mijidieh to\r\nthe chief inspector, claimed to be German, and took my bags through\r\nunopened.\r\n\r\nThe approach to Constantinople by train is over a long, marshy plain.\r\nOccasional camel caravans lumber along the road beside the tracks,\r\nand cranes, pelicans, and storks rise majestically and sail away as\r\nthe train passes. The outskirts of Constantinople are repulsive. The\r\ntrain passes down a narrow street between rows of miserable dwellings,\r\nmany no larger than drapers’ boxes, roofed with flattened petroleum\r\ntins; and at the base of the decaying walls of the city, excavations,\r\nclosed with more petroleum tins, form the kennels of indolent gypsies.\r\nThe entrance to Constantinople by train is not attractive. To see its\r\nglories one must come up the Bosphorus.\r\n\r\nConstantinople is almost an antithesis of Sofia. One is a country\r\ntown, small and new; the other is an Imperial city, great and old,\r\nwith palaces and paupers, masters and slaves, and squalid barbaric\r\nsplendour. It is a world capital, whereto all Christian countries send\r\ntheir Ministers, to vie with each other for the favours of an Asiatic\r\nmonarch who rules by their discord. It is a place where many races\r\nmeet and morals fleet. ‘No city in the world, not even Rome, has more\r\npersonality.’\r\n\r\nWith the Golden Horn and the Sweet Waters of Asia at her feet, with\r\nher mighty mosques and towering minarets, marble palaces and treasure\r\nstores, Constantinople would seem a glorious city. But this is not the\r\nimpression one obtains.\r\n\r\nWithin the city, to the unaccustomed eye, the horrible sights eclipse\r\nall others. The place is foul, and suffering, hungry creatures, human\r\nand animal, are pitiable to behold. The streets, except in front of the\r\npalaces and embassies, are seldom cleaned, and if one ventures out of\r\ndoors on wet days he must wade through sloughs of filth.\r\n\r\nBeggars, purposely maimed, and with ‘incurable diseases, including\r\nlaziness,’ beset one on every side; mangy, starving dogs, lying on the\r\npavements, are so numerous that pedestrians must take the roadway; and\r\npitiable beasts of burden labour painfully along under fearful burdens.\r\n\r\nA Turk, in his way, is most humane towards animals, and it is the Jews\r\nand the Christians who treat them badly. According to Western ideas, it\r\nwould be a kindness to put the unhappy dogs of the imperial city out of\r\nexistence; but the Turk reasons differently--what Allah has given life\r\nshould live at Allah’s will.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOGS OCCUPY THE PAVEMENT; PEOPLE WALK IN THE STREETS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TURKISH BARBERSHOP.]\r\n\r\nIn a street in Constantinople one day, I saw a miserable puppy rolled\r\nover by a carriage. Its hips were crushed, and it seemed to suffer\r\nagony. I went to a drug store near by and fetched some chloroform,\r\nbut on attempting to administer it, a powerful _hoja_, who evidently\r\nknew what it was, put his hands on my shoulders and gently thrust me\r\nback. He informed some of the bystanders of my intention, and they\r\nlifted their hands and pointed towards heaven. They recognised me as a\r\nforeigner. Had I been a native non-Moslem they would not have been so\r\ngentle. If a native Christian kills a dog he is sent to prison--unless\r\nhe subscribes a sufficient bribe to the court’s revenue.\r\n\r\nVery often the Mohamedan’s charity takes the form of a distribution\r\nof food to the dogs, and the narrow streets are sometimes blocked\r\nby an enormous pack catching bits of bread from the hand of some\r\npenance-maker. But the garbage from the houses is the only certain\r\nsource of subsistence that the dogs have. They know to a minute the\r\ntime of day each family throws out its refuse, and if you pass along\r\nthe streets in the early morning you can mark the houses which have not\r\nyet rendered up their daily quota by the canine crew waiting before the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe dogs of Turkey are more like wolves in appearance than domestic\r\nanimals, but they are perfectly harmless. They rarely find\r\nsufficient food, and seldom taste meat, which may account for their\r\ngentleness--but their want of proper nourishment has no effect upon\r\ntheir lungs. Between them and the firemen night is made hideous in\r\nConstantinople. As certain as the setting of the sun one’s slumbers\r\nwill be disturbed before the dawn by a most unearthly screeching--even\r\nworse than that of the London firemen--accompanied by the high-pitched\r\nyelps of countless dogs.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish fire department is a curious institution. Modern machinery\r\ncannot be brought into Turkey except by bribing the Custom-house. As\r\nit profits officers of the Government nothing to bribe themselves, the\r\nmunicipal fire brigade is still equipped with the primitive hand-pump.\r\nElectricity, like steam, is also barred, and the alarm system is\r\ndistinctly original and truly alarming. From the ancient tower of\r\nGalata and from the Seraskier Tower in Stamboul, watchmen keep a\r\nlook-out for fires. When one is discovered half a dozen swift runners\r\ngrab long, sharp spears, descend several hundred ruined stone steps\r\nthrough the darkness slowly with the aid of a tallow taper, dart out\r\ninto the crowded streets, and scatter in various directions, shouting\r\nat the tops of their voices and stabbing dogs. They make a tour of the\r\nmosques, from the minarets of which the volunteer firemen are called\r\nto duty. Meanwhile guns have begun to boom on the Bosphorus, and in a\r\nshort time the streets are swarming with frenzied creatures, dashing\r\nalong like maniacs, shrieking hideously, and also prodding dogs out of\r\ntheir way.\r\n\r\nIt is not an uncommon sight to see these strange firemen come down the\r\nstreets from a five-mile run with nothing on but a pair of pants,\r\nor perhaps a skirted vest--sometimes only a fez; and then you will\r\nsee others dressed like soldiers marching in a leisurely and orderly\r\nmanner. The energetic individuals are the volunteers; the others are\r\nmembers of the regular ‘paid’ fire department.\r\n\r\nThe ambition of every chief of volunteers worthy of the name is to\r\nbring his brigade to the scene of the conflagration first, as the\r\nreward of the first arrivals is the choice of the plunder. Should he\r\nfind there is no loot to be had, he searches out the owner and bargains\r\nwith him while his band prepares to pump--if a satisfactory price can\r\nbe agreed upon. This work must be done hurriedly, of course; not that\r\nthere is any danger of the ‘paid’ brigade arriving before the fire is\r\nout, but other volunteers are pouring in; competition grows rifer, and\r\nrows and fights with rival crews more and more furious. Finally, the\r\n‘paid’ department does arrive, and the volunteers are driven from the\r\nruins like hungry wolves from a carcass. The ‘paid’ firemen will accept\r\nno gratuities; they are soldiers of the Sultan, and have many months’\r\nsalary due to them.\r\n\r\nMany regiments of the garrison of Constantinople, however, are well\r\npaid, for they constitute a part of that vast organisation maintained\r\nby Abdul Hamid for the express purpose of his own safety. This, indeed,\r\nseems to be the first purpose of the whole Turkish Government--the\r\nsafety of the Sultan, for which Mohamedan and Christian of the\r\nImperial Ottoman Empire suffer alike. The difference in the attitude\r\nof the ‘infidel’ and that of the ‘faithful’ is simply that one resents\r\nthe needless hardships inflicted upon him, whereas the other sits and\r\nsuffers, resigned to the will of Allah. The word ‘Islam’ means ‘I am\r\nresigned.’ The Sultan is recognised as Mohamed’s vicegerent on earth,\r\nand to his will all faithful followers bow.\r\n\r\nThe Padisha, however, does not appear to accept the doctrine of\r\nfatalism with the same good grace as do the faithful of his Mohamedan\r\nsubjects. Extraordinary precautions are taken for his safety. At a\r\n_Selamlik_, or public visit to a mosque for prayer, which I attended,\r\nAbdul, who professes to the Mohamedan belief that no bullet could\r\npierce his flesh until the moment prescribed in the Great Book, came\r\nto worship surrounded by a bodyguard so solid that the ball of a\r\nmodern rifle could not have reached him through it. His escort arrived\r\nrunning, massed about his victoria, the hood of which is said to be\r\nof steel. In former years foreign guests, for whom Ambassadors and\r\nMinisters would vouch, were permitted, in a pavilion crowded with\r\ndetectives, to see this ceremony. But since the recent explosion of\r\nan infernal machine in the neighbourhood during a _Selamlik_, this\r\nprivilege has been abolished. An army corps, gathered from every part\r\nof the variegated empire, surrounded the palace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONSTANTINOPLE: MOSQUE OF YÉNI-DJAMI ON THE BOSPHORUS.]\r\n\r\nConstantinople is full of stories about precautions within the\r\nwalls of Yildiz Kiosk. It is said that the Sultan tests his meals on\r\nhis servants before he touches them himself, and, for obvious reasons,\r\nhis favourite dish is _œufs à la coque_. A tale from his harem gives\r\nit that, one day when his nerves were unusually unstrung, he drew his\r\nrevolver and with his own hand shot a wife who caused his suspicion\r\nby a sudden change of posture. It is told that an American lady who\r\npointed out to the Sultan a way by which he could be assassinated\r\nreceived a handsome present, and it is well known that there is an army\r\nof spies employed solely to run down plots against the Sultan’s life.\r\nThese unprincipled servants often find conspiracies where they do not\r\nexist, often only in order to display to their master their activity,\r\nand again for the rich rewards such ‘discoveries’ bring.\r\n\r\nOnce in Paris I met a Greek who had served for two years as a private\r\nsecretary at Yildiz. Greeks and other non-Moslems occupy many posts in\r\nthe Sultan’s service where cleverness and an understanding of European\r\ncharacter are imperative. This particular Greek incurred the Sultan’s\r\nsuspicions, and was clever enough to escape from Constantinople. I was\r\nindeed glad to get the opportunity to talk with a man who had been of\r\nthe Sultan’s household, and many of the tales I had heard, which needed\r\nproof, I repeated to him. He said they were mostly true--in principle.\r\nHe did not believe that the Sultan had faith in one word of the Koran;\r\ncertainly he was no fatalist. The Greek went on to say that while the\r\nSultan is crazed on the one point of plots against his life, he is\r\nremarkably clever at handling men. He seems to have an uncanny power\r\nover men. When they first meet him they are surprised at his sanity\r\nand his gentility, which is a good beginning; and he gradually weaves\r\nhis web of influence about old and tried ambassadors. The only people\r\nwho have been thoroughly equal to him are the Russians; they play his\r\nown game. They have played on his weak point and made a treaty with\r\nhim--according to this gentleman--guaranteeing his throne to him for\r\nthe rest of his life in return for certain privileges which allow them\r\nto take inventory of his estate. ‘Après moi, le déluge!’ But the Sultan\r\nis not quite all of his Government, and for the others the entire\r\nindemnity for the war of 1878, as it is paid in annual instalments, is\r\nset aside--so my informant says--for distribution at Constantinople.\r\nThe Palace and the Porte probably receive from Russia retaining fees\r\nlarger than their salaries.\r\n\r\nI happened to be in Constantinople again at a time when the Russians\r\nwere meeting with defeat in Manchuria. The town was much interested\r\nin the contest, and the Turk in the street, who is ignorant, was\r\nrejoicing in his dignified way at the reverses of his country’s enemy.\r\nBut suddenly the Russians turned the tables and won several astounding\r\nvictories over the Japanese, and the Moslems were unhappy. This is\r\nhow it happened. ‘The Palace’ had discovered that the sensibilities\r\nof the Russian representatives in Turkey were being tried severely by\r\nthe reports of their defeats in the Far East, and that individual of\r\nmarvellous imagination, the Turkish censor, was put to work to lighten\r\ntheir distress, which he did most generously.\r\n\r\nAccording to the press of Constantinople all is ever serene throughout\r\nthe imperial Ottoman dominions, everybody is always lauding the\r\nPadisha and praying for the safety of his good and gracious Majesty.\r\nPersons who are interested in the provinces subscribe to European\r\npapers, and have them brought in by the foreign posts. During my first\r\nstay at Constantinople thousands of troops were being shipped to\r\nSalonica daily, but as this fact would hardly accord with the sublime\r\ndeclarations of the Ottoman newspaper, they were embarked only after\r\nnightfall, when the inhabitants are mostly behind barred doors.\r\n\r\nI presented a letter from the Turkish Commissioner at Sofia to a\r\ncertain Turkish Minister, whose name I must not mention, and was\r\nushered into his presence alone. The letter, I was told, recommended me\r\nhighly as ‘a friend of the Turks,’ though I protested my neutrality;\r\nand I understood that I would receive good treatment at the hands of\r\nthe officials and get all the news. What I wanted was permission to\r\ncross Macedonia beyond the railway.\r\n\r\n‘Why do you desire to make this trip?’ asked the Turk. ‘It is\r\ndangerous, and the accommodations are very poor. If you will remain\r\nhere you may come to me daily and I will tell you the truth about\r\neverything that is going on in the country.’\r\n\r\nOf course I declined this.\r\n\r\nThe Turk puffed at his cigarette and sipped his coffee, thinking for a\r\nfew minutes; then he turned and regarded me. Until then I had thought I\r\nhad an honest face.\r\n\r\n‘You can make thousands and thousands of francs out of the Turks,’ said\r\nthe Minister.\r\n\r\nI pretended not to take him.\r\n\r\n‘Thousands and thousands of francs!’ he repeated impressively.\r\n\r\n‘And what would I have to do?’ I asked.\r\n\r\n‘Write the truth,’ the Turk replied softly.\r\n\r\n‘It is not necessary to pay me to do that,’ I responded.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency said that a telegram would be sent to the Vali of\r\nSalonica instructing him to permit me to go where I would. A _teskeré_\r\nwould be issued to me here viséd for Salonica. I thanked the Turk, but\r\nI felt that I should not be allowed to go very far.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of my interview at the Sublime Porte I received a\r\ncup of delightful coffee, but it was the most expensive cup of coffee\r\nI ever drank. I had not provided myself with sufficient small change\r\nfor a visit to the Turkish Government building. On my departure after\r\nthe interview his attendants were lined up in the corridor like the\r\nservants at a French hotel. I was stripped of my silver and copper, and\r\nwhen I had given my last _metaleek_[2] I hurried out of the door.\r\nBut, unfortunately, I did not take a carriage, and I had hardly got a\r\nhundred yards down the street when a little old Turk, who proved to\r\nbe the man who had given me the coffee, touched me on the arm, and\r\nsaid, ‘Effendi, backsheesh.’ This coffee-man followed me a quarter\r\nof a mile further to the nearest shop, where I changed a lira and\r\ngave him his tip. My dragoman explained that unless I distributed\r\nbacksheesh liberally the Minister would never be in to me again, and,\r\nthinking perhaps some day I might have to make another call upon him, I\r\n‘squared’ myself with his doormen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HAMMAL AND A LOAD OF PETROLEUM TINS.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, on each occasion that I have made the journey from\r\nConstantinople to Salonica I have been pressed for time, and could not\r\nawait a steamer to take me through the Dardanelles. The train makes the\r\ntrip three times a week, leaving Constantinople at night.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve o’clock the first night out a Turkish officer opened\r\nthe door of my compartment, which I had had to myself up to this\r\ntime, and entered with a beaming smile and a grand salaam. This was\r\nextraordinary; the Turks are generally more dignified or else more\r\nsubtle. My travelling companion, I saw by his attire, was a pasha.\r\n\r\nThere was not the detachment of troops usually arrayed at the station\r\nto do honour to a general about to start on a journey, and three\r\nyoung officers, very likely his adjutants, who were the only friends\r\nto see him off, seemed unnecessarily depressed. But the general had\r\nmirth enough for the company, and up to the moment the train left he\r\nspun yarns and cracked jokes to the torture of the others, who tried\r\nloyally to affect amusement. When the third bell sounded for the train\r\nto resume its progress the pasha shook hands warmly with his young\r\nfriends through the window; they pressed their cheeks to his in Turkish\r\nfashion, then gave him the low Turkish salute due to his rank. The old\r\nman turned to me with a smile, and asked by a sign whether I would have\r\nthe window closed. I shrugged my shoulders, meaning ‘suit yourself,’\r\nand asked my companion if he could speak French. ‘Turk,’ he replied,\r\nmeaning only Turkish. I cannot describe exactly how we made each other\r\nunderstand, but before we lay down to sleep I had told him I was an\r\nAmerican correspondent, and had learned that his medals were in token\r\nof distinguished services in the Russo-Turkish war and elsewhere, and\r\nthat his destination was Tripoli, which means exile.\r\n\r\nWhen I said, ‘Padisha?’ with a questioning look, he signified by a\r\nbenign glance upward and a lift of two fingers to his lips that not a\r\ndoubt must be entertained as to the Sultan’s goodness. After a moment\r\nhe placed the Sultan in a spot and drew a circle about him. ‘Espion,’\r\nhe said, pointing to the circle, and turned up his nose.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the pasha’s orderly brought him a fresh water-melon,\r\nwhich he broke in two, giving the larger portion to me. At Dede-Aghatch\r\nhe gave me a cordial hand-shake, and directed me to a place for\r\nbreakfast; then he stepped into a carriage, which was waiting for him,\r\nto take him to the ship in which he was to set sail to his doom.\r\n\r\nIn covering this same route a few months later our train passed a\r\n‘special’ stopped on a ‘siding.’ Aboard it was a staff of officers,\r\ntheir orderlies and servants. Sitting on the bench in the station yard,\r\ncomplacently sipping coffee, I recognised the Vali of Monastir. He,\r\ntoo, was now billeted for exile.\r\n\r\nAmong the many demands of the Russians at the assassination of their\r\nConsul at Monastir was the displacement of this Vali. The Sultan\r\nwill comply with any demands the Russians make in earnest, but he\r\nhas certain punishments which his subjects seek to win. To be exiled\r\nwithout the privilege of seeing Constantinople ‘for the last time’ is\r\ndisgrace, but to be condemned _via_ an audience with the Sultan spells\r\n‘Thou good and faithful servant,’ and brings a substantial post in\r\nAsia, away from the interference of ‘infidel’ Powers and carrying with\r\nit a lordly pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSALONICA AND THE JEWS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen ‘the voyager descends upon’ the Grand Hôtel d’Angleterre at\r\nSalonica, his attention is first drawn to the regulations as to the\r\nmanner in which he shall conduct himself during his sojourn at the\r\ngrand hotel. These regulations are printed in gaudy letters in Turkish,\r\nin Greek, and in French, and hang in gilded frames on the walls of each\r\nbedroom in the most conspicuous place. A literal translation from the\r\nFrench is in part as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. Messieurs the voyagers who descend upon the hotel are requested to\r\n  hand over to the management any money or articles of value they may\r\n  have.\r\n\r\n  2. Those who have no baggage must pay every day, whereas those who\r\n  have it may only do so once a week.\r\n\r\n  3. Political discussion and playing musical instruments are\r\n  forbidden, also all noisy conversations.\r\n\r\n  4. It is permitted neither to play at cards nor at any other game of\r\n  hazard.\r\n\r\n  5. Children of families and their servants should not walk about the\r\n  rooms.\r\n\r\n  6. It is prohibited to present oneself outside one’s room in a\r\n  dressing-gown or other negligent costume.\r\n\r\n  9. Coffee, tea, and other culinary preparations may not be prepared\r\n  in the rooms or procured from outside, as the hotel furnishes\r\n  everything one wants.\r\n\r\n  10. Voyagers to take their repast descend to the dining-room, with\r\n  the exception of invalids, who may do so in their rooms.\r\n\r\n  11. A double-bedded room pays double for itself, save the case where\r\n  the voyager declares that one bed may be let to another person. It\r\n  is, however, forbidden to sleep on the floor.\r\n\r\nI should explain that no insult is meant to the French on the part\r\nof the hotel management by employing their language as one of the\r\nmediums of instructing its many-tongued guests in proper deportment.\r\nThe management realises that of all Europeans Germans are most in need\r\nof lessons in deportment; but the hotel, for some reason, is rarely\r\nafflicted with Germans, and French is understood by all the people\r\nof the Near East of the class that patronise a hostelry like the\r\nd’Angleterre.\r\n\r\nThere are several hotels in Salonica which will not permit guests to\r\nsleep on the floor.\r\n\r\nSalonica is the metropolis of Macedonia, and an important commercial\r\ncentre. It is the Thessalonica of old, built by Cassander on the\r\nsite of ancient Therma, and named by him after his wife, a sister of\r\nAlexander the Great. It is older than Constantinople, and has a history\r\nwhich just falls short of being great. Xerxes and his hosts camped on\r\nthe plains between Therma and the Axius, now the Vardar, and the view\r\nof Mount Olympus across the bay inspired him to explore the course\r\nof the Peneus; and a short time before the Peloponnesian War the\r\nAthenians occupied Therma.\r\n\r\nThessalonica fell into the hands of the Romans, became the chief city\r\non the Via Egnatia, and disseminated Christianity among many of the\r\nSlavs, Bulgarians, and other peoples who came down from the north and\r\nthe east.\r\n\r\nIt became a free city and then a part of the Byzantine Empire, and was\r\nfinally sold by a Greek emperor to the Venetians, from whom it was\r\ncaptured in 1430 by the Turks.\r\n\r\nHigh up in the Turkish quarter of Salonica--which rises in a long slope\r\nand then in steps from the sea--is a queer little Greek monastery\r\ndating back unknown centuries. It was there when the Turks came; for\r\nhistory records that the monks within its walls were treacherous to\r\ntheir fellow-Christians and sold the city to the Mohamedans. Under the\r\ncourtyard of the monastery runs the aqueduct which supplies Salonica\r\nwith water from the mountains, and supplied Thessalonica five hundred\r\nyears ago. It was access to this, a certain means of reducing the city,\r\nthat the monks of Chaoush (such is the name of the monastery) bartered\r\nwhen the Mohamedans besieged Thessalonica, for certain privileges to\r\nbe granted after the conquest. The Turks have kept their bargain to\r\nthis day, but Chaoush has not flourished. Time has moved the Christian\r\nquarter down to the sea, and the monastery is surrounded to-day by\r\nhouses with latticed windows.\r\n\r\nOnce, when searching for this monastery with a fellow-countryman who\r\nconducted the mission at Salonica, I happened to open by mistake the\r\ngate of a Turkish yard. There was a rapid covering of faces by an\r\namazed assembly of females. Discovering our error, we closed the gate\r\nand moved off; but veiled women, stones, and innuendoes were soon upon\r\nour heels, and our retreat in order shortly became an utter rout.\r\nHappily the unfortunate error occurred at an hour of the day when there\r\nwere no husbands at home, and the women themselves were not in attire\r\nto follow us far.\r\n\r\nI loved to ramble up through the Turkish quarter of Salonica where\r\nthe native ‘infidel’ fears to tread. There is a charm about using\r\nthe liberty one’s country commands. I generally stopped at a Turkish\r\ncafé on the route, and sat out in the narrow street on a stool with\r\na cup of coffee on another before me, the subject of curious regard\r\nby mollahs and hojas in their long cloaks, and other Mohamedans of\r\nlittle work. Once at one of these cafés, with an English boy whom I\r\npicked up at Salonica for interpreter, I got into conversation with\r\na harmless-looking Turk on the subject of wars and the Powers; and I\r\nlearned from him that the Moslems are going to rise again, and will not\r\nstop in their conquests until they have subdued the world.\r\n\r\n‘Abdul Hamid is a great prophet, infallible and invincible,’ said the\r\nTurk.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to three old warships in the harbour (whose machinery had\r\nbeen sold to a second-hand junk dealer years ago) as specimens of the\r\nmeans with which the work was to be accomplished; and it was useless to\r\ntell him that even the British navy was superior to that of his Sultan.\r\nHe pitied me for my exceeding ignorance of history, because I thought\r\nthe Turks had been defeated in the field several times; they had never\r\nbeen defeated!\r\n\r\nHis culminating remark had a touch of pathos in it. He was a\r\nhungry-looking individual himself, and was glad to get the two\r\npiastres we gave him for showing us the way to the wall. ‘The hosts of\r\nthe Padisha,’ he said, quoting, I judge, some mollah, ‘are the most\r\npowerful force in the world; but unfortunately they have not enough to\r\neat.’\r\n\r\nThis ignorance is due to the teachings of the mollahs, from whom the\r\nyoung Turks derive, directly or indirectly, all of their knowledge.\r\nWhile I was in Salonica an order came from Constantinople to purge the\r\nlibrary in the military school, and as a result all reading books,\r\nincluding modern histories which dealt with the decline of the Turkish\r\nEmpire, were destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WALL AND BEYOND, SALONICA.]\r\n\r\nWe often went up to the Turkish quarter, but never learned the road to\r\nthe gate. But with a few words of Turkish, which one must naturally\r\npick up, and many signs, we could generally manage to get coffee and\r\ndirections. We always halted at the gates, and, supplied with stools\r\nby the _café-ji_ there, sat and rested for half an hour, watching\r\nthe children come to the fountain with jugs for water, the women\r\nslip noiselessly by, covering their faces with special care at spying\r\nus, and the men pass through the eye of the needle hunched up on\r\nunder-sized asses. Truly a Biblical scene, though the characters were\r\nMohamedans.\r\n\r\nThere is a great dignity about the ruling race, the man for whom all\r\nothers step aside, who drinks first at the fountain and removes his fez\r\nnowhere. He is not loud or voluble, and seldom loses his temper. When\r\nhe is provoked he does not squabble, but strikes.\r\n\r\nThe Christian natives of Salonica are generous in warning one of\r\ndangers outside the walls, of brigands and revolutionists; but we\r\noften strolled through the gates and over to the barren hills beyond,\r\nencountering Turks, Albanians, and Bulgarians, perhaps insurgents,\r\nwithout mishap.\r\n\r\nThe hills were especially attractive in the afternoon, cooler than the\r\nclosed-in bay below, and pervaded with a quiet in delightful relief\r\nfrom the ceaseless babble of swarming Levantine tradesmen down in the\r\ntown. At sunset hour we found a favourite spot on the edge of a steep\r\ndeclivity with only a broad expanse of plain between us and the purple\r\nmountains of Thessaly. The sun dropped into a dip in these and left the\r\nsky for an hour rich in Oriental colouring flaming from behind. To the\r\nsouth a stern bit of the old wall on the precipitous corner of a rock\r\nwas silhouetted, and we could never tell whether we preferred this in\r\nor out of the picture. That is a true test of quality, when either\r\nof two things is preferred as it happens to be at hand; generally the\r\nunpossessed is the desired.\r\n\r\nTourists do not come to Macedonia, but if they did they would find\r\na show that no other part of Europe can produce. Not only is the\r\ncomic-opera stage outdone in characters, in costumes, and in complexity\r\nof plot, but the scene is set in alpine mountains on a vaster scale\r\nthan Switzerland affords. But to pass all these--for the play comes\r\nin in the course of the book, and scenery baffles description--there\r\nare relics of the ages that would interest many a man who has already\r\ntravelled far. Salonica is said to be richer than any city in Greece in\r\necclesiastical remains, and its ancient structures, for the most part,\r\nhave borne well the ravages of time. There are many great edifices,\r\nbuilt by the Romans during their occupation and by the Greeks in their\r\ntime, and a minaret at the corner of each denotes the purpose it serves\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThere is a mosque of St. Sophia at Salonica, built, like its great\r\nsister at Constantinople, during the reign of Justinian, and with a\r\nhistory also marked by the wars of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.\r\nBut a fire of four years ago and an earthquake more recently have\r\nwrecked the place, so that it is no longer used. The Rotunda, now the\r\nEski Metropoli Mosque, was built by Trajan, after the model, though\r\non a smaller scale, of the Pantheon at Rome, and was dedicated by\r\nhim to the rites of the mysterious Cabiri. It is circular, the dome\r\nunsupported by columns. The whole of the interior is richly ornamented\r\nwith mosaics which seem to have belonged to the original temple, as\r\nnothing about them divulges adjustment at Christian hands.\r\n\r\nOne of the best preserved models of ancient Greek architecture\r\nextant is said to be the Eski Djuma Mosque. In the porch are several\r\nDoric columns, and within the building is a double row of massive\r\ncolumns with Corinthian capitals. There are ‘The Church of the Twelve\r\nApostles,’ and the mosque of St. Demetrius, whose shrine within is\r\nrevered by Moslems and Christians alike.\r\n\r\nBetween the Rotunda and the sea is the site of the Hippodrome, where\r\nTheodosius, the last of the Emperors who were sole masters of the\r\nwhole Roman Empire, caused to be committed one of the bloodiest of\r\nmassacres for which Salonica is famous. Although a zealous follower\r\nof Christianity, and commended by ancient writers as a prince blessed\r\nwith every virtue, his moderation and clemency failed signally on this\r\noccasion. In order to chastise the people for a movement in favour\r\nof a charioteer very popular among them, and who had been arrested\r\nat his order, the inhabitants were assembled at the Hippodrome under\r\nthe pretext of witnessing the races, and then barbarously massacred,\r\nwithout distinction of age or sex, to the number of seven thousand.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the main street, which once formed part of the Egnatian\r\nWay, stands a triumphal arch generally supposed to have been raised\r\nin honour of Constantine, to celebrate the return from his victory\r\nover the Sarmatians. The supports are faced with white marble highly\r\nwrought, representing a battle between Roman troops and barbarians, and\r\na triumphal entry into a city. The arch was repaired and plastered over\r\nsome years ago in a painful manner, with no regard to conformity with\r\nthe supports.\r\n\r\nThe doubt which encompasses the history of every ancient place in\r\nSalonica finds its climax in the spot where St. Paul preached. There\r\nare no fewer than seven of these, and the Christian who would stand\r\nwhere the Apostle stood has to make a long pilgrimage of mosques and\r\nsynagogues. The main street of Salonica, which once formed part of the\r\nVia Egnatia, is lined to-day with curious little shops like boxes, ten\r\nor twelve feet square, and often smaller. The floors are all up off\r\nthe ground from two to three feet, and the keepers need no chairs. The\r\ncustomer stands on the narrow pavement, and the man within reaches\r\nfor what is wanted from where he sits on crossed legs. He is a most\r\nindifferent salesman, and one may take or leave his wares without\r\ndrawing a word from him. A large percentage of these little places\r\nare weapon shops, where belt-knives from six to eighteen inches in\r\nlength are made on the premises, and also gaudy pistols of tremendous\r\nbores. Second-hand English revolvers are in the collection, strung\r\nacross the opening, and brand-new Spanish models. The prices of the\r\nforeign weapons are high, and when one asks the reason, the explanation\r\nis given that they are all contraband, and the Customs officers\r\nhave to be paid large sums for passing them. These arms dealers will\r\nsell to anyone who will buy, Turk, Jew, and Christian alike. The\r\nGovernment places no restriction on the sale of arms to non-Moslems:\r\nthe regulation is that they shall not possess them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ANCIENT ARCH OF CONSTANTINE, SALONICA.]\r\n\r\nThis is also the street for native shoes, which are manufactured on the\r\npremises. The most common foot-gear, worn by every Balkan people, is\r\nthe ‘charruk.’ It is something more than a sandal, for it has a cover\r\nfor the toes; it is a slipper pointed like a canoe bow, and closely\r\nresembles an American Indian’s moccasin. It is made of skin with hide\r\nlacings, which are wound high up a pair of thick woollen stockings,\r\nworn like leggings over the trousers. The Turk often wears these, but\r\nseldom do his women. The Turkish woman’s favourite footwear is a cross\r\nbetween a sandal and a clog. It is simply a wooden block the shape of\r\nthe sole of a shoe, and an inch or more thick, with nothing to hold it\r\non the foot but a strap across the toes. A European cannot keep them\r\non his feet, but the Turk manipulates them with marvellous dexterity.\r\nTheir great convenience is the rapidity with which they can be shed, as\r\nthis has to be done on so many occasions throughout the Turkish day:\r\nat the hours of prayer, and on entering the presence of superiors,\r\nand, obviously, whenever it is desired to sit comfortably, for a Turk\r\nis most uncomfortable if he is not sitting on his feet. These clogs\r\nare hacked with a hatchet out of solid blocks of wood, and even the\r\nshoe in high favour with the Consular kavass, a red thing with a huge\r\nblack _pompon_ on a turned-up toe, is manufactured by the squatting\r\nshopkeeper.\r\n\r\nIn this street one is not shouted at, or dragged bodily into the shops\r\nif he stops to look at a display of wares, as he is in Greek and Jewish\r\nquarters. This is the business street of the man who opens his shop and\r\nsits still till Allah provides the trade.\r\n\r\nCertain classes of shops in Salonica perambulate.\r\n\r\nThe cart has to be largely dispensed with in most Turkish towns,\r\nchiefly because the streets are paved. This is not the case in\r\nSalonica; the paving is comparatively good there; but the Macedonian\r\nhas got into the habit of providing for roads paved with cobble stones.\r\nOver the backs of asses and sure-footed mountain ponies the butcher\r\nhas an arrangement of carving boards, and cuts off a lamb chop or a\r\nroast at his customer’s door. One has to rise early to see the heads\r\nstill on the lambs, for they are great delicacies, and go first, and\r\nwhen roasted the unbounded joy of the native cracking the skull and\r\npicking out the tasty bits is nauseating in the extreme. The entrails\r\nof animals are also relished; they are eaten as the Italian eats his\r\nmacaroni.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TURKISH BUTCHER.]\r\n\r\nThe milkman, generally a Tzigane, does not drive the cow through the\r\nstreets, but brings the milk slung over an ass, in a skin, one end of\r\nwhich he milks at order. A small Jew, with a huge fez and a man’s coat\r\nwhich reached almost to the skirt of his dress, was a daily nuisance\r\non Consul Avenue. I suppose he dragged his four-footed draper’s shop\r\ndown the aristocratic foreign thoroughfares to show off his father, who\r\ndressed in ‘Franks,’ but whose bellow was distinctly Levantine.\r\n\r\nIn summer months the two-footed lemonade stand would be a pleasant\r\nencounter were it not so numerous. But as it is generally an Albanian,\r\nit does not pester one to buy: it simply requires one to get out\r\nof its road. It carries a shelf in front with half a dozen glasses\r\nstuck in holes, a copper pitcher in its hand with water for rinsing\r\nglasses after Christians have used them, and a curious reservoir of an\r\nover-sweet drink on its back. If this receptacle has not many little\r\nmetal pieces to jingle upon it, the gaily garbed Albanian keeps up a\r\ntapping with two glasses as he advances down the street.\r\n\r\nMost of the men of Macedonia wear a form of skirt, but especially in\r\nSalonica does the new arrival feel that he has landed among a race of\r\nbearded women. The most picturesque dress to be seen in Salonica is\r\nthat of the Southern Albanian. It is a sort of ballet skirt, like that\r\nof the Greek ‘Evzones,’ a white, pleated thing about the length of a\r\nHighlander’s kilt. But the Albanian is more modest than the Scot, and\r\nwears his stockings to a proper height.\r\n\r\nThe skirted man most in evidence, however, is the Jew, and his skirt\r\nis indeed a marvellous garment. It resembles a dressing-gown made of\r\nsome bed-curtain or sofa-cover material. It is plain in cut, dropping\r\nstraight from the shoulders to the heels, but of the most wonderful\r\ndesigns in cotton prints. On the Sabbath day, which the Jew observes\r\ndevoutly, he adds to his costume a long Turkish sash, and also,\r\nregardless of the weather, a greatcoat of a good black cloth lined with\r\nermine. One would hardly suspect these thrifty Israelites of undue\r\nvanity, and yet for no other reason than to enhance their personal\r\nbeauty do they suffer this oppressive garment on the hot Saturdays of a\r\nSalonica summer.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish girl dresses in ‘Franks’ until she is married, but at her\r\nwedding she receives as a dowry an outfit of clothes fashioned after\r\nthose her mothers have worn for countless generations. This is an\r\nexpensive trousseau, and is calculated to last all her life, for she\r\nis not to be a burden to her husband in the matter of dress. The most\r\ncostly garments in the wardrobe are a fur-lined greatcoat--almost\r\na duplicate of her husband’s--and the covering for her hair. This\r\nlatter is in the nature of a tight-fitting green cap, with a border of\r\nprobably red and a chin-strap of still another colour. The cap extends\r\nto a long bag behind, in which her braid of hair is stuffed. On the end\r\nof this bag a square of several inches is worked in pearls, wherein\r\nlies the value of the cap. In skirts the women, like their husbands,\r\ngo in for gaudy cotton prints. Their waists are cut exceedingly high.\r\nIn the back the skirt falls from somewhere between the shoulders, but\r\nin front a short white blouse is visible, which is cut for street\r\nwear (and worn winter as well as summer) almost as low as a European\r\nlady’s ball-dress. It becomes difficult for me to give further details\r\nof this feminine attire, so I respectfully refer curious ladies to the\r\naccompanying photograph, which, though snapped for the character it\r\npresents, also portrays a specimen of these curious gowns.\r\n\r\nI believe that formerly the Hebrew religion required the women to hide\r\ntheir hair and the men to wear dresses, but to-day these customs are\r\ncontinued by them from habit, for economy, and with a purpose. Their\r\npurpose in dressing alike is to look alike, as it is dangerous in\r\nTurkey for a non-Moslem--or even a Moslem--to rise above his fellows in\r\neither wealth or position. The Sultan considers it a danger to himself\r\nfor one of his subjects to grow powerful, and he maintains a staff of\r\nlevellers who have various means of reducing the man who dares to rise.\r\nThe successful Turk is exiled; other subjects are dealt with in other\r\nways.\r\n\r\nI once had occasion to send a report to London that a number of\r\ndynamite bombs had been discovered by the police in the office of a\r\nBulgarian merchant just opposite the British post office in Salonica.\r\nThe Turkish authorities took care to let the foreign correspondents\r\nhear this news. It was some weeks later that I learned how the bombs\r\ngot so near the British post office. The business of the Bulgarian\r\nmerchant, whose name was Surndjieff, had been prospering noticeably.\r\nThe merchant received notice one day that a certain sum--say, one\r\nhundred liras--was required of him by the police. He had paid all his\r\nlegal taxes, and, being a stubborn Bulgar, he refused to subscribe the\r\nblackmail. A second demand, in the form of a warning, was sent to him,\r\nand still he took no heed. One morning he arrived at his office and\r\nfound his door unlocked. Everything within seemed undisturbed, however,\r\nso he set about his duties. In about an hour a detachment of gendarmes\r\narrived with an order to search the premises, and the very first drawer\r\nopened by the officer in command contained a dozen ‘infernal machines.’\r\nOf course the Bulgar was arrested at once and incarcerated in the White\r\nTower, to escape from which cost him several hundred liras in bribes to\r\ngaolers and others.\r\n\r\nNow, the Jew’s property is no safer at the hands of the Turkish\r\nofficials than is that of the Christian, and yet the Jew is a loyal\r\nsupporter of the Turkish Government. But there are reasons for this\r\nloyalty. The Jews of Salonica, like most of those of Constantinople,\r\nfound a refuge in Turkey from the Spanish Inquisition, and if they\r\nhave not liberty in the Sultan’s dominions, they have at least equal\r\nrights with Christians. Their position is even, perhaps, better than\r\nthat of the Turk, who indeed is one of the greatest sufferers from\r\nthe oppression of the Turkish Government. The Turk is the ruler of\r\nthe land and the privileged person, and the Jew has learned never to\r\ndefy his authority. But what cares the Jew who makes the laws so\r\nhe may make the money? He has learned to outwit the Turk and to take\r\ncare to let the Turk take unto himself that credit. This would not\r\nsatisfy one of the Christian races, who all have scores to pay and\r\nambitions to realise; their gratification at defeating the Turk would\r\nonly be complete if the Turk suffered the knowledge of the fact. The\r\ncoveting of Macedonia by the Christian races in and about Turkey is\r\nanother cause for the Jews’ support of the present administration; for\r\nunder Greek, Serb, Bulgar, and Rumanian the Jews would not occupy the\r\nposition of most favoured subjects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEWS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEWISH WOMEN.]\r\n\r\nMost of the Jews of Salonica wear the fez, but some of the wealthy\r\nones, who would enjoy their wealth, have acquired the protection of\r\nforeign Powers, and dress in European clothes. Viennese and Parisian\r\nstyles and makes of clothes are not too good for them, and they travel\r\nto Austria and to France regularly in the warm months of the year.\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew boy is generally educated in his father’s shop, but the girl\r\nis often given a good schooling, which raises her in mind and morals\r\nfar above the man she marries--which is sad. Among the various large\r\nforeign schools at Salonica there is one for girls conducted by the\r\nBritish Mission to the Jews. It affords a means of learning English,\r\nwhich makes it a most popular institution; and it is within the reach\r\nof all classes, because pupils are taken at whatever they can afford\r\nto pay. But while the school has been conducted for many years, and\r\nan old Scottish missionary (who has recently died) preached to the\r\nscholars for half a century, there is yet to be recorded a single\r\nconvert to Christianity. The old Scotchman once told me that he thought\r\na good share of the blame for his failure was due to the example his\r\nown countrymen set. He said he hated to go into the street when the\r\nBritish fleet was in the harbour because he was invariably asked by\r\nsome Israelite if he wanted to convert them to ‘that’--pointing at a\r\ndrunken sailor. A drunken man is rarely seen in the streets of Salonica\r\nexcept when a foreign fleet is in the bay, and the ‘drunks’ are most\r\nnumerous when that fleet is British.\r\n\r\nThe hundred and one bootblacks (all Jews) who infest the cafés of\r\nSalonica, and swarm about the hotels to pester the unfortunate inmates\r\nas they emerge, are in great glee when an Englishman appears. They\r\nmistook me for an Englishman, but whenever I sought to disillusion a\r\nnative on this score, I was told ‘England, America--all the same.’ The\r\nJews all speak a few words of English, learned, no doubt, from their\r\nsisters.\r\n\r\n‘When comes the English fleet?’ is the first question a bootblack puts\r\nto an Englishman.\r\n\r\n‘Do you want the English fleet to come to Salonica?’ I asked.\r\n\r\n‘You bet!’ They must have acquired this from the American missionaries.\r\n\r\n‘Why?’\r\n\r\n‘English sailor get much bootshines; pay very well. Ten shillin’ me\r\nmake one day--English sailor very much drunk always.’\r\n\r\nJews are always very fond of music, and they fill the cafés-chantants\r\nof Salonica on Saturday evenings. Extracts from ‘Carmen,’ ‘Traviata,’\r\n‘Faust,’ and like operas were being rendered by a small troupe of\r\nItalians at one of these places, to which the entrance fee was two\r\npiastres--about fourpence. But this was beyond the price of the\r\npopulace, and the masses flocked to another place of amusement a little\r\nfurther down the quay, where no entrance fee was charged, and by\r\npurchasing one cup of coffee you could sit and hear the music the whole\r\nevening. Here there was a French artist whose répertoire was known by\r\nthe whole town, and the audience made it a rule to shout for the songs\r\nthey desired to hear. A certain duet about dogs and cats, in which the\r\nlady meowed and a sickly looking male partner barked, was the Jews’\r\nfavourite recital. Late one Saturday evening, when the singers stopped\r\nfor a cue, the Jews in the audience began to bark, which was the\r\nrecognised signal for the dog song. But there were a number of Greeks\r\nin the audience who wanted the lady to sing alone, and they set up a\r\ncall for one of her solos. The respective parties attempted to shout\r\neach other down, which raised an unearthly din in the neighbourhood,\r\nand soon resulted in a pitched battle. But the cry of ‘Soldiers’\r\nbrought the conflict to an abrupt termination, and before the gendarmes\r\narrived both the Jews and the Greeks were scurrying for their homes as\r\nfast as their legs could carry them.\r\n\r\nThe Jews are rigorous observers of the fourth commandment in so far as\r\nthey themselves are concerned. Under no circumstances will one of them\r\ndo a stroke of work on their Sabbath day. But they have no scruples\r\nagainst enjoying themselves by the labour of others. The small boats in\r\nthe bay are owned entirely by the Jews, and all the week they hustle\r\nfor Christian and Turkish patronage. But on Saturday evenings in summer\r\nthey indulge in the hire of Christians and Turks to row them up and\r\ndown the city front on the smooth water of the bay.\r\n\r\nThe various Sabbaths in Turkey are somewhat annoying to the traveller.\r\nOn Fridays the Turkish officials will not _visé_ passports or issue\r\n_teskerés_; on Saturdays the Jews refuse to shine your boots; on\r\nSundays the Christian shops are closed. But neither the Turks nor the\r\nChristians observe their days of rest with the same rigour as the Jews\r\ndo. Though it is impossible to get a _teskeré_ from the Turkish Konak\r\non the Turkish Sabbath, a note waiving the necessity of the document\r\ncan be had for a consideration. We all know the Christian is not an\r\nover-strict observer of Sunday.\r\n\r\nSalonica is unfortunate in possessing a colony of each of the\r\nMacedonian races. Besides Turks and Jews, there are many Greeks and\r\nAlbanians, some Bulgarians and Servians, and a few Kutzo-Vlachs\r\n(Wallachians) and Tziganes, and still another people peculiar to the\r\ntown. One is struck in Salonica by the beautiful Mohamedan ladies who\r\nwalk along the streets with their veils thrown back; and it impels one\r\nto think that the woman who pulls her veil down when she sights a man\r\nmust necessarily lack beauty. Not so; one is a Turk and one is not a\r\nTurk.\r\n\r\nThe handsome females who wear the Turkish garb, but do not always\r\ncover their faces, are a peculiar sect of Jews alleged to be converted\r\nto Mohamedanism. They live, like all the other peoples, distinctly\r\nto themselves, not even associating with the Turks; and while they\r\nare too few to have a national entity, they carry on, nevertheless,\r\ntheir little feuds with the Jews. Their story is this: Some centuries\r\nago a Jew of Salonica, by name Sebatai Sevi, declared himself to his\r\npeople as their long-promised redeemer, and won a certain following.\r\nHe is an example of power making jealous his monarch. At the Sultan’s\r\norder he was conveyed to Constantinople and taken into the Padisha’s\r\npresence. His plea was heard, but found no credence at the Palace,\r\nand the false prophet was given the alternative of death for himself\r\nor conversion to Mohamedanism with his entire flock. The Government,\r\nno doubt, granted all the assistance Sebatai needed to ‘persuade’ his\r\nfollowers to make the change, and it was soon accomplished. But, unlike\r\nChristians converted by pressure or force to the religion of the Turk,\r\nthese Jews have not become fanatics. Indeed, they are quite luke-warm\r\nabout the religion, and it is supposed they profess Mohamedanism simply\r\nfor safety, and practise Sebatai’s religion in secret. They never marry\r\noutside their own sect, not even with the Turks. There is a story of\r\nlong standing to the effect that the little circle of Dunmehs (for this\r\nthey are called) once subscribed a purse of 4,000_l._ to purchase the\r\npretensions of a Turkish pasha to the hand of a fair maiden of their\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nThe Dunmehs are the richest people, on the whole, in Salonica. With\r\ntheir Hebrew instincts for business and their position as Mohamedans,\r\nthey have a decided advantage over the other peoples. They fill\r\nlargely the _rôle_ of Government contractors, and secure many of\r\nthe plums in the gift of the administration, which it is impossible\r\nfor non-Moslems to get, and for which the Turks are too indifferent\r\nto trouble themselves. The Dunmehs make a speciality of purchasing\r\nthe rights to gather tithes, for which they often pay more than the\r\nlegal value thereof. These rights they divide into small sections and\r\ndispose of at a profit to the actual collectors of taxes. The tithe is\r\nlegally one-tenth of the crop, but as it is measured by the collectors,\r\nsupported by a guard of Turkish soldiers, it generally assumes larger\r\nproportions, sometimes attaining to a quarter, and even a half, of the\r\npeasant’s harvest. And there is no resource for the peasant against\r\nthis unjust confiscation, as the first law of the Turkish court is the\r\nKoran, which, as interpreted, provides that the word of a Christian\r\nshall not offset that of a Mohamedan.\r\n\r\nBut army and other contracts, for which the payment is forthcoming from\r\nthe Turkish Government, are not often sought by the Dunmehs. These are\r\nleft to Turks with influence at the Palace; for influence at the Palace\r\nor at the Porte is necessary in order to secure any payment from the\r\nTurkish Government. Ismail Pasha, an Albanian in the high esteem of\r\nAbdul Hamid, and with many friends among the Palace clique, is the only\r\nman in Salonica with courage enough to undertake Government contracts.\r\nAnd his daring is proportionately rewarded.\r\n\r\nThis man’s history is worthy of recital; it reads like that of a\r\nself-made millionaire. He was born of poor but dishonest parents, and\r\neducated himself--dispensing with the arts of reading and writing. He\r\nbegan life as a _khanji’s_ boy, learned there how to rob the wayfarer,\r\nand attained, at the age of eighteen, a competency in a brigand band.\r\nStep by step, as the men above him died off (sometimes by indigestible\r\npills, and sometimes by falling backward on the knife of an ambitious\r\nsubaltern), Ismail became a leader. In this capacity he did his work\r\nso well, striking terror to the heart of both Turk and Christian, that\r\nhis ability was recognised by no less a person than Abdul Hamid, who\r\nsaw in him a man of exceptional ability. This self-made man was invited\r\nby the Sultan to Constantinople, there decorated, given the title of\r\nPasha, and sent to Salonica with the high commission of first-class\r\nspy, assigned to the task of reporting to his Padisha the doings of the\r\ngovernor of the vilayet.\r\n\r\nNow, an official in Turkey always knows his spy, and the spy always\r\nknows that his man knows him. The spy and his man, of course, are\r\nalways together, and they become the most intimate friends. Naturally,\r\nthe man seeks ever to please his spy, which in this case makes Ismail\r\nPasha virtual Vali of the vilayet. He dictates the names of the police\r\nwho shall be employed--and naturally has a preference for outlaws;\r\nkaimakams and other officers of districts hold their places at his\r\npleasure; and Government contracts are awarded to Ismail Pasha, be his\r\nbid high or low. Ismail is the trusted ally of Abdul Hamid, and is\r\npermitted, therefore, to grow rich and powerful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE DYNAMITERS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of my first visit to Salonica one of the American\r\nmissionaries took me over the town sightseeing. When we came to the\r\nlocal branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank, a modern bank building of\r\nquite an imposing appearance, my fellow-countryman said he had heard\r\nthat ‘the committee’ were going to dynamite the place. But this was\r\nno news to me, for, on alighting at the railway station, the Greek\r\nporter of the Angleterre had told me of this project of the insurgents,\r\ngiving it as a reason why I should stop at his hotel instead of at\r\nthe Cristoforo Colombo, which stood just beside the bank; and the Jew\r\nbootblacks while shining my shoes had discussed the coming ‘outrages’\r\nand had told me several exact days on which they would take place. A\r\nrevolutionary plot so widely known could be little more, I thought,\r\nthan a work of native imagination, and, as the missionary held a\r\nsimilar view, I lengthened not my stay in Salonica to await the\r\nevent. I was in search of exciting ‘copy,’ and without the slightest\r\nsolicitude for that I left behind, took my way to the interior of the\r\ncountry. During my absence the authorities raided a Bulgarian khan\r\nin the neighbourhood of the bank, which rumour fixed upon as the bomb\r\nfactory of the committajis; but they discovered no insurgents and no\r\ndynamite. The real factory, however, was not a hundred feet away, and\r\nwhen I returned from my excursion inland I occupied a room in the\r\nHôtel Colombo which directly overlooked it. It was, to all outward\r\nappearance, a little Bulgarian shop in a narrow, unpretentious street,\r\nand the shopkeeper and his customers were only simple, dirty peasants.\r\nI often watched the Bulgars enter and leave the place, but so little\r\ndid I suspect their real character that only three days before their\r\nattack I deserted Salonica again for the Albanian district.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish bootblacks had fixed upon Easter as the day for the\r\ndynamiting: that was a Christian festival, they knew. But the Easters\r\nof both calendars came and went without disturbance--though the\r\ngarrison of the town was augmented on every ‘appointed’ day, to be\r\nready to suppress the ‘rising’ of Bulgarians in an expeditious manner,\r\nwhile every Bulgarian barred his door lest the suppression should come\r\nwithout the dynamiting. It was after many appointed days had passed by\r\nwithout mishap, and most of the Asiatic soldiers had been withdrawn\r\nfrom Salonica and sent to join the army for the penetration of Albania,\r\nthat the promises of the insurgents were at last fulfilled. Someone has\r\nsaid ‘Fools lie; wise men deceive by telling the truth.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASIATIC SOLDIERS: ‘REDIFS.’]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WAITING FOR DYNAMITERS, SALONICA.]\r\n\r\nAll of the special correspondents--gathered like vultures in\r\nMacedonia to prey on the harvest of death--knew of the prediction for\r\nSalonica; but correspondents flock together, and we all followed the\r\nleader to Uskub with our hawk eyes set upon Albania. And there we were,\r\nin Uskub, when the dynamiting took place. The news reached us about\r\nnoon of the morning after the event. Instead of eating luncheon, I got\r\na travelling bag ready and boarded the south-bound train at half-past\r\ntwo, with one other correspondent--an Englishman. Happily, we were not\r\nrivals: he represented a London daily and I was working for America:\r\notherwise we might have resented each other’s presence. As it was we\r\nrejoiced together at having a clear start of twenty-four hours on the\r\nothers, for there is but one train to Salonica each day.\r\n\r\nBy nightfall the Englishman was bored by my conversation and I was\r\nbored by his, and, having nothing to read, we stretched ourselves out\r\non the seats of our compartment and went to sleep soon after dark.\r\nIt was in this condition that we arrived in Salonica at half-past\r\nten o’clock; but nobody woke us, and we slept on. The few other\r\npassengers--all Turks, as Bulgarians were restricted in travelling at\r\nthe time--left the train quietly and repaired to a khan across the\r\nroad to spend the night. The train hands, frightened Christians, lost\r\nno time in ‘shunting’ the train, and after placing it on a ‘siding’\r\na quarter of a mile from the station, deserted it, us included, and\r\njoined the Turks in the crowded café.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight I awoke and wondered where I was. It gradually dawned\r\nupon me that I was aboard a train, and I rose and looked out of the\r\nwindow. Every light was out: they must have been extinguished from\r\nabove or we should have been discovered. I could discern, indistinctly,\r\nin the faint light of a new moon, a waving line of high grass on both\r\nsides of the train, and here and there a low, thick tree, but not a\r\nhouse was visible. I woke the Englishman. Towards the city, usually\r\naglow with little lights from the water’s edge all the way up to the\r\nwall on the hills, only a few dim lamps now shone. The gas main to\r\nthe town had been cut by the committajis the night before, and they\r\nhad also attempted, in their dynamite revel, to destroy a troop train\r\nnot far from the spot where ours now stood. We knew that the railways\r\nwere patrolled everywhere and doubly guarded in the vicinity of\r\nSalonica, and there was little chance of our getting out of the train\r\nwithout being seen. We also knew that the Turk is averse from taking\r\nprisoners on any occasion, and naturally supposed that the deeds of the\r\ndynamiters--for many of whom they were still hunting--had not tended to\r\nlessen this Mohamedan characteristic. But to remain in the train and be\r\ndiscovered in the small hours of the morning by some excited Asiatic\r\nseemed a greater danger, and we decided to take to the open at once.\r\nWhereupon we gathered our bags, quietly opened the door, jumped to the\r\nground and scurried through the high grass in the direction of the\r\ntown. Fortunately we escaped from the train without detection. But we\r\nhad gone hardly a hundred yards when a Turkish shout went up that was\r\nboth a challenge and an alarm. We saw the Turk who gave the yell, for\r\nthe moon was behind him, but I am sure he only heard us. He was near\r\na tent, and the first to respond to his call for assistance were his\r\ncompanions from within. Six of them rolled out from under the canvas in\r\ntheir clothes, rifles in hand, and in a minute more there were twenty\r\nothers by his side, all jabbering high Turkish. We had dropped our bags\r\nat the challenge and thrown up our hands, but still they did not seem\r\nto see us. They evidently thought we numbered forty--the usual size of\r\nan insurgent band--and it took us some time to convince them that we\r\nwere only two Englishmen.\r\n\r\n‘_Inglese Effendi_’ was the extent of our Turkish, and this we shouted\r\nto them with every variation of accent we could contrive, trusting\r\nthey would comprehend our meaning in one form or another. I had not\r\nforgotten in the excitement that I was an American, but neither had I\r\nforgotten that the Turks consider an American a peculiar species of\r\nEnglishman, and the situation was such that I was willing to forgo\r\ndetail in explanation. They located us at once from the noise we were\r\nmaking, and, as soon as they had loaded and cocked their rifles, spread\r\nout single file like Red Indians, and wound a circle about us--keeping\r\nat a safe distance from our dynamite. During this manœuvre an animated\r\ndiscussion took place as to whether--we judged--it were not better to\r\nshoot us first and find out afterwards whether we were Bulgarians\r\nor not. This process was boring, for our arms were growing numb,\r\nand yet we dared not lower them. They shouted to us a score or more\r\nquestions, but we could understand not a word. And we, concluding our\r\nTurkish had failed, tried them with English, French, and German, and\r\nthe Englishman (who was the linguist) in a rash moment discharged a\r\nvolley of Bulgarian. It was well for us then that these soldiers (as we\r\nlearned later) had arrived from Asia Minor only a few days before, and\r\nknew not even the tone of the insurgents’ language. They had understood\r\none variation of our ‘_Inglese Effendi_,’ and though they could not\r\nimagine what ‘English gentlemen’ were doing on a railway line beyond\r\nthe city in the dead of night, there was one among them willing to take\r\nthe chance of capturing us alive. But the bold fellow was not without\r\ngrave fears, as the manner in which he performed this task amply\r\ndemonstrated. All guns were turned on us:\r\n\r\n  Rifles to front of us,\r\n  Rifles to back of us,\r\n  Rifles all round us,\r\n  But nobody blundered.\r\n\r\nThe Turks signed to us to keep our hands up. We could lift them no\r\nhigher so we stood on our toes--to show how willing we were to comply\r\nwith all suggestions. Then the brave man who had volunteered to take us\r\nprisoners made a long détour and approached us from behind stealthily,\r\nlest we should turn upon him suddenly and cast a bomb. I was made aware\r\nof his arrival at my back by a thump in the spine with the muzzle of a\r\nloaded and cocked rifle. The finger on the trigger was nervous--if it\r\nwas anything like its owner’s voice--and I dared not even tremble lest\r\nthe vibration should drop the hammer of his gun. I being thus in my\r\ncaptor’s power, the other Turks approached. One unwound the long red\r\nsash from his waist and with an end of it bound my hands. Meantime,\r\nthe Englishman had been surrounded, and two curly-bearded fellows,\r\ngripping his hands tightly, dragged him to my side and bound his wrists\r\nwith the other end of the red sash. Our proud captor then seized the\r\ncentre of the sash, and, carefully avoiding our baggage, led us away\r\nto the camp in exactly the same manner as he would have led a pair of\r\nbuffaloes, and the other soldiers followed, jabbering, at our heels.\r\nOur captor’s tugging pulled the sash off my wrists, but I held on to\r\nit and pretended I was still shackled, considering the fright it would\r\ngive the Turks to discover me mysteriously at liberty again.\r\n\r\nWe were kept but a few minutes at their camp, then taken through the\r\nrailway station, now deserted, across a road to the Turkish café where\r\nthe other passengers and the train crew were spending the night. It\r\nwas a peaceful spectacle we entered upon, but we soon disturbed the\r\ncomposure of the Christians in the place. The train crew was stretched\r\nout on the floor snoring lustily, and the passengers, because of their\r\nrace, sat on the tables, their feet folded under them, occupied in\r\nsucking hookahs. Our dramatic entrance, on the ends of the red sash and\r\nsurrounded by ragged soldiers, did not distract the Mohamedans from\r\ntheir hubble-bubbles, but the snoring ceased immediately.\r\n\r\nWe pounced upon the conductor before he was on his feet, and through\r\nhim, by means of French, explained to our captors who we were and\r\nhow we happened to be in the train, and demanded our release. But\r\nthe Asiatics threatened the Christian and he slyly deserted us and\r\nslunk out of the door. The passport officer, who records arrivals,\r\na Mohamedan, took it upon himself to relieve us of the bondage of\r\nthe red sash and returned it to its owner, whereupon he brought upon\r\nhimself a storm of abuse from the Asiatics, and he too deserted us.\r\nOne by one all the Christians escaped to the next khan, taking their\r\nsnoring with them, but leaving the curly-bearded Anatolians and the\r\n‘bashi-bazouks.’[3] These Turks remained perched on the tables, our\r\nonly company through the whole long night, apparently without a thought\r\nof a thing but their gurgling pipes. Indeed, not even the occasional\r\nsound of an explosion in the town caused them so much as to lift their\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers knew now that we were foreigners, and did not attempt\r\nto re-bind our hands, but they continued to keep us prisoners with\r\nthe object of securing ransom money. Had we been subjects of their\r\nSultan we should probably have had our pockets searched, but, being\r\nforeigners, our persons, at least, were favoured with a grudged respect.\r\n\r\nWe refused persistently to comply with their demands for money, until\r\nthey became violent. When they had given our bags ample time to\r\nexplode, one of the Turks fetched them to the café, but declined to\r\nsurrender them unless we paid him. Even this we refused to do. Hereupon\r\none truculent fellow whipped out his bayonet and shook the blade in\r\nour faces, at the same time drawing a finger significantly across\r\nhis throat and gurgling in a manner that must have been copied from\r\nlife. This realistic entertainment so impressed me that I rewarded\r\nthe actor with all the small change I possessed, about six piastres.\r\nThe amount did not satisfy him by any means, for he explained that he\r\ndesired to divide the money with his companions, but I dreaded to show\r\nthem gold, and handed over an empty purse--my money was in a wallet.\r\nThen they put pressure on the Englishman, but he flatly declined to\r\nreward them and pretended to prefer the alternative they offered. Bold\r\nBriton! they turned from him in disgust and proceeded to fight over the\r\nshilling I had given them. The individual who had drawn his bayonet\r\ncarefully replaced it in its scabbard and slung his gun by a strap\r\nover his shoulder before entering the fray. And not once did he or any\r\nof the others use a weapon, though they punched each other’s faces\r\nviciously--not, however, disturbing the bashi-bazouks on the tables,\r\nwhose rhythmic suck of the hubble-bubbles could be heard above the\r\nirregular sounds of the brawl.\r\n\r\nThe fight concluded and quiet restored, the Englishman got writing\r\nmaterials out of his bag and proceeded to take notes for despatches.\r\nBut this proceeding did not meet with the approval of our guards. The\r\ntruculent individual walked round behind him without a word, and drew\r\nhis bayonet again. This time he was truly alarming, for he was alarmed\r\nhimself. He suspected that we were making a report of the treatment we\r\nhad received. Now this Englishman was none other than ‘Saki,’ author\r\nof ‘Alice in Westminster,’ a man who would write an epigram on the\r\ndeath of a lady love. In a few minutes Saki’s mind had risen above all\r\nearthly surroundings in search of an epigram on a capture by Turks,\r\nand he was oblivious to the presence of the Asiatic hovering over him.\r\nPerceiving my friend’s unfortunate plight, I came to the rescue, shook\r\nhim back to earth, and persuaded him to destroy his papers. We could do\r\nnothing the rest of the night but sit and study the Turks and listen to\r\nthe rhythmic gurgles of the hubble-bubble pipes.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning two army officers arrived and came into the khan\r\nfor coffee, and we appealed to them in French to relieve us from\r\nthe tender mercies of our tormentors. But they sipped their coffee\r\nunaffected, and informed us that the soldiers were not of their\r\ncommand. Indeed, these Asiatics seemed to be of nobody’s command! Up\r\nto the hour they took it into their heads to return to the railway\r\nstation, no superior officer came near them. It was about six o’clock\r\nwhen they departed, leaving us without ceremony. There were already\r\ncabs at the station, bringing passengers for the early train, and one\r\nof these took us into the city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe streets of the city, usually crowded at dawn, were still deserted\r\nby all except soldiers when we entered. There were sentinels seated\r\ncross-legged at every corner, who rose and unslung their guns as\r\nour carriage approached--the dynamiters had gone to their work in\r\ncarriages. But we were not halted on this ride, for we had a Turkish\r\ndriver who served as a passport. We drove first to the hotel named\r\nfrom America’s discoverer, but finding it had been put out of business\r\nby the same explosion that destroyed the bank, we went back to the\r\nAngleterre. After a wash and breakfast we at once set about gathering\r\nan account of the events of the past two days. It was difficult,\r\nhowever, to move through the town, Asiatics challenging us at every\r\nturn, and we sought out the British Consul for assistance.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at the Consulate just as the Vice-Consul, accompanied by the\r\nConsular kavass, was starting on an official tour of investigation.\r\nThis was an opportunity we could not afford to miss. We attached\r\nourselves to the Vice-Consul, and the gentleman protested. But he was\r\ncourteous in his objections to our company, and we remained with him.\r\nHis great solicitude was to know the exact number of the slain on both\r\nsides, a fact which concerned us less than graphic accounts of the\r\nfighting; for it is a duller story to say a thousand people were put\r\nto the sword than to give in detail the way a single Christian died.\r\nH.M. Vice-Consul was a careful young man, with little confidence in\r\ncorrespondents. He evidently thought it would be useless to provide\r\nus with accurate information, and took no trouble to point out to us\r\nthat the slaughter had not assumed the proportions of what might in\r\nTurkey be called a massacre. He seemed to concern himself chiefly with\r\npriming himself to contradict in his official despatches the gross\r\nexaggerations wherein we would undoubtedly indulge; and in view of his\r\nservices to us we were both sincerely sorry to disappoint him.\r\n\r\nThe dead were all now removed from the streets, though the routes taken\r\nby the carts in which they were collected could still be traced to the\r\ntrenches by clotted drippings of blood and bloody wads of rags on the\r\nroads. The Consul led the way to the Bulgarian cemeteries in the hope\r\nof being able to count the corpses, but the last spadeful of earth was\r\njust being shovelled into the long graves as we entered the gates. We\r\ncould only, therefore, estimate the number. We paced off the dimensions\r\nof the excavations, and, taking the word of the Turkish official that\r\nthe bodies were laid but one row deep, estimated that there could not\r\nbe more than twenty in a trench--and, as far as we knew, there were\r\nbut three trenches throughout the city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WRECK OF THE OTTOMAN BANK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTERING THE DYNAMITERS’ DEN.]\r\n\r\nFrom the cemetery we followed the Consul to the site of the Ottoman\r\nBank and passed with him through the cordon of troops which surrounded\r\nthe ruins. Workmen were busily engaged uncovering a tunnel under the\r\nstreet leading from a little shop opposite to a vital spot beneath the\r\nbank. The little shop was that which I had watched so often from my\r\nwindow in the Hôtel Colombo. The peasants I had seen enter and leave\r\nthe place had been, many of them, insurgents in disguise. The stock\r\ndisplayed in front was only a ruse to cover the real merchandise, which\r\nhad come all the way from France and had been passed by the Turkish\r\nCustoms officials on the payment of substantial backsheesh. We were\r\ntold that ‘special’ customers of this shop went away nightly with heavy\r\nbaskets, now suspected of containing the earth excavated during each\r\nday. It is said to have taken the insurgents forty days to cut the\r\ntunnel, by means of which they were able to blow up the bank.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were preparing to break into the den of the dynamiters,\r\nand we waited in the street to see what they would discover within.\r\nThey were compelled to enter first by a side window, because the iron\r\nfront of the place was stoutly barred. They made an opening large\r\nenough for a man to pass through, and two of them climbed in cautiously\r\nwith lighted lanterns. I do not think they expected to discover any\r\nBulgarians, dead or alive, within--nor did they--but they feared to\r\ntread on dynamite. They found a sword of the pattern in use in the\r\nBulgarian army, and a wooden box with a small quantity of dynamite,\r\nand a basket containing a strange assortment of other things. They\r\npassed these trophies out of the window and permitted us to examine\r\nthem. In the basket were several yards of fuse, a few pounds of steel\r\nlugs for making bombs more deadly, a bottle half full of wine, a hunk\r\nof native cheese, and a string of prayer beads. The dynamite, in the\r\nshape of cubes two inches thick, was carefully packed in cardboard\r\nboxes, on the covers whereof were instructions for use printed in three\r\nlanguages--French, English, and German, in the order named.\r\n\r\nThere is some irony in the fact that the explosives supplied to the\r\ninsurgents by France did most damage to citizens of the country from\r\nwhich they came. The revolutionary attack on Salonica was directed\r\nprimarily against Europeans and European institutions, ‘as a threat\r\nand in punishment for the non-interference of the civilised nations\r\nin behalf of the Christians of Macedonia.’ The Imperial Ottoman\r\nBank is owned and conducted largely by Frenchmen and Italians, the\r\n_Guadalquivir_ belonged to the Mesageries Maritimes Company, and\r\nagainst these institutions the insurgents accomplished their most\r\nsuccessful dynamite work. They began the eventful day with an attempt\r\nto blow up a troop train leaving for the interior, crowded with\r\nAnatolian soldiers. An ‘infernal machine’ was placed on the railway\r\ntrack over which the train was to pass in the early morning, but it was\r\ntimed to go off a few minutes too soon, and exploded before the train\r\nreached the spot.\r\n\r\nTheir next exploit was more cleverly contrived. It was the destruction\r\nof the French steamer. A Bulgarian, describing himself as a merchant,\r\nand possessing the requisite _teskeré_ for travelling in Turkey\r\nduly viséd, took second-class passage for Constantinople aboard the\r\n_Guadalquivir_, and went aboard with his luggage a few hours before the\r\nship sailed. He inspected the steamer, pretending mere curiosity, and\r\nlearned that the state rooms amidships were allotted only to passengers\r\nholding first-class tickets; whereupon he paid the difference in\r\nfare and shifted a heavy bag into a cabin nearer the engine-room. A\r\nfew minutes before the ship weighed anchor the Bulgarian hailed a\r\nsmall boat and went ashore, ostensibly to speak to a friend on the\r\nquay, leaving all his baggage behind. But he did not return, and the\r\nship sailed without him. She was hardly in motion, however, before a\r\nterrible explosion amidships wrecked the engine-room, cut the steering\r\ngear off from the wheel-house, and set the vessel afire. The concussion\r\nwas of such violence that it is said to have shaken the houses on the\r\nquay, nearly two miles away. The engineer and several firemen were\r\nseverely injured, but no one was killed. Another vessel in the harbour\r\nwent to the assistance of the _Guadalquivir_, rescued the crew and\r\npassengers, and towed the ship back into port. There was a suspicion\r\nof foul play, but the cause of the explosion was not definitely fixed\r\nuntil that night.\r\n\r\nCrowds soon collected to watch the ship burn, and grew until at evening\r\nthe whole town was on the quay--little suspecting that this was the day\r\nfor the long-promised dynamiting. The plot was well planned.\r\n\r\nAn ‘infernal machine’ placed under a viaduct which carried the gas main\r\nover a little gulley, exploded promptly at eight o’clock, and this was\r\nthe signal for the general attack. Before the lights of the city had\r\nfinished flickering, a carriage dashed up to each of the principal\r\nopen-air cafés along the water-front, and several drew up before the\r\nbank. In each of them were two or more desperate men, who in some\r\ncases jumped out and threaded their way to the midst of the wondering\r\ncrowds, before hurling their deadly missiles. They made for the places\r\nwhere their bombs would do damage among the foreign element and the\r\nmost prominent citizens, and attempted to throw them into the thickest\r\ngroups. But the people, already alarmed, were on the _qui vive_, and\r\nfew of the explosions in the cafés did really effective work. The\r\nMacedonians are well drilled in scurrying into their houses, and,\r\nrecognising the attack at last, they did not linger till the troops\r\ncame. The dynamiters tried to catch some ‘on the wing,’ but a bomb is a\r\npoor weapon for use against the individual.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of the Alhambra personally pointed out to us the holes\r\nmade in his curtains and his stage, and gave us pieces of shell he had\r\ngathered in his yard; but two tables and three coffee-cups and one man\r\nwas the complete record of the destruction wrought at his establishment.\r\n\r\nDynamite requires confinement to be thoroughly effective. The\r\ndestruction of the Imperial Ottoman Bank was thorough. The Bulgarians\r\nwho had this work in charge were evidently the pick of the band. Four\r\nof them alighted from their carriage in front of the building and\r\nseveral others behind it. Those attacking the front, in the guise of\r\ngentlemen, succeeded in getting near enough to the two soldiers on\r\nguard to overpower them and cut their throats. Then they began casting\r\nbombs at the windows. The other insurgents entered the courtyard of the\r\nHôtel Colombo and hurled bombs into the doors of the German skittle\r\nclub, a low building at the back of the bank. While these two divisions\r\nof dynamiters were at this work, and their confederates were elsewhere\r\nattacking various places, the charge beneath the bank was set off.\r\nA vast hole was rent in the rear wall of the building, the skittle\r\nclub was demolished and the front of the Hôtel Colombo shattered. The\r\nmanager of the bank, who lived above the offices, escaped with his\r\nfamily before the building succumbed to the fire, and all but one of\r\nthirty Germans who were in the skittle club at the time got out with\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\nThe explosions of the bombs caused the wildest panic everywhere, but\r\nthey seem to have been remarkably ineffective. They were thin-shelled\r\nthings (I have seen several), some three and some four inches in\r\ndiameter, with a hole for loading. The shells and the dynamite were\r\nimported separately and put together in various places in the town.\r\nThe insurgents appear to have had little knowledge in the manipulation\r\nof the bomb other than what was contained in the printed instructions.\r\nIn some cases--in the mountains--they have blown themselves to pieces\r\nwhile loading shells.\r\n\r\nThe dynamiters escaped in most instances. After doing their work they\r\nsought cover, leaving the excited soldiers to wreak their vengeance on\r\nthe unarmed Bulgar. This is a part of their system, that those who will\r\nnot join them shall suffer for their weakness. But in one place the\r\ninsurgents were trapped, and a pretty fight took place ’twixt dynamite\r\nand rifle, for the account of which I am indebted largely to the wife\r\nof a missionary, who witnessed it through the blinds of one of the\r\nmission windows.\r\n\r\nThe American Mission at Salonica is one block--an Oriental block cut\r\nby crooked streets--away from the spot where the Ottoman Bank stood.\r\nIt was opposite an antiquated Turkish fort, and next door to the\r\nGerman school. On the other side of the school is a little house with\r\na broad balcony overlooking the schoolyard. This little house was one\r\nof the insurgent rendezvous, though unknown and unsuspected. About half\r\nan hour after the explosions at the bank, while the little party of\r\nAmericans watched the burning bank from the back of the mission, bombs\r\nbegan exploding, seemingly almost under their door, at the side of the\r\nhouse. The American property was not the object of the attack; it was\r\ndirected against the German school. The insurgents had, apparently,\r\nwaited until the troops from the fort were drawn off to other parts\r\nof the city before beginning their job. They threw their bombs from\r\nthe balcony down at a corner of the building, where they exploded. The\r\ndetonations were deafening, but the whole damage to the school was less\r\nthan that which a single bomb would have wrought if put into one of the\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\nBut the fort opposite had not been left entirely deserted, and a few\r\nminutes after the first report it opened fire from the battlemented\r\nwalls. The Turks were soon reinforced by two detachments of troops\r\nwhich came up from opposite directions. One force, in the darkness,\r\nmistook the other for insurgents and fired into them. For more than two\r\nhours the fight continued, during which probably forty bombs exploded\r\nand hundreds of rifle cracks rent the air. The missionary’s wife told\r\nme she had seen the Bulgarians light their fuses in the room, then dash\r\nout on the terrace and throw the bombs into the street below. Several\r\ntimes the Turks attempted to rush the place, but the street was narrow\r\nand stoutly walled, and whenever they came up the Bulgarians dropped\r\nbombs into them and drove them back. Towards the last the insurgents\r\nstaggered out and only dropped their bombs. As they lit the fuses the\r\nAmericans saw one of them bleeding from a wound in the face, and the\r\nother from the chest. Finally the defence ceased, and the Turks charged\r\nthe little fortress successfully. They battered in the door and\r\ndragged out the garrison, both undoubtedly beyond earthly suffering.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeveral of the dynamiters went up with their bombs; some were killed\r\nby the soldiers in the streets during the night, but a majority (I\r\nwas told by an insurgent) got out of the town safely before morning\r\nand made their way, singly and severally, to join other bands in the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nEarly the following morning the Turkish population came down from the\r\nhill in a body, yataghans in hand, ready to clear out the Bulgarian\r\nquarter. But Hassan Fehmi Pasha, the Vali of Salonica, had anticipated\r\nthis descent of the ‘faithful,’ and himself drove out and cut them off\r\nand persuaded them to leave the work to the soldiers. A house-to-house\r\nsearch of the Bulgarian quarter was begun at once, and every male\r\nBulgarian of fighting age was hounded out. They had barred their doors\r\nand hidden themselves in the darkest corners of their houses. But the\r\nbars did not defy the soldiers’ axes, and their hiding places were\r\ngenerally shallow, and practically the whole male population was locked\r\nup in ‘Bias Kuler’ (White Tower) and the prison in the wall. No women\r\nwere arrested in this ‘round up,’ but one was shot in the streets. The\r\nreason, it is said, was that her figure was padded with dynamite bombs.\r\n\r\nJust two months prior to this general incarceration of Bulgarians\r\na general amnesty had taken place. The Sultan by a single Iradé\r\nreprieved all Bulgarian prisoners. The prisons of European Turkey were\r\nthrown open, exiles were brought back from across the seas and set\r\nfree. Political and criminal offenders were treated alike. Brigands\r\nreturned to the mountains, petty thieves to the cities, and insurgents\r\nto revolutionary bands. Among the last was the chief of the ‘internal\r\norganisation,’ Damian Grueff, who returned from Asia Minor to resume\r\nsupreme command of the committajis. This was one of the features of the\r\nAustro-Russian ‘reform’ scheme. The Sultan evidently desired to begin\r\nit with a grand display of beneficence, perhaps foreseeing the result\r\nof this liberality. The British Government, at any rate, appreciated\r\nthe error of the act and protested against its being executed; but\r\nGreat Britain had given a mandate to Russia and Austria to do in Turkey\r\nwhat one of them cannot do at home, and what both are seriously doubted\r\nof honestly desiring.\r\n\r\nAlmost as absurd as this general amnesty were the general arrests\r\nwhich now followed the ‘Salonica outrages.’ Not only was the Bulgarian\r\ncommunity of Salonica put behind bars, but an attempt was made to\r\nextend the wholesale incarceration throughout Macedonia. This proved a\r\nfailure for two reasons: the Turks could not catch the revolutionists,\r\nand they had not gaols enough to contain the unarmed Bulgars. When the\r\ngaols were filled with ‘suspected’ peasants extraordinary tribunals\r\nwere created in the several consular towns to judge the prisoners. I\r\nvisited one of these while ‘in session.’ The building was a shanty in\r\nthe outskirts of the town; it had been whitewashed for this function.\r\nThe usual cellar (an excavation under a Macedonian house) served to\r\nhold the prisoners in waiting. A score of them, manacled, were brought\r\nfrom the gaols every morning, and choked into this dark hole, whence,\r\none at a time, they were unchained from their partners and sent up the\r\nladder into the court. Three dreamy looking Turks and two corrupted\r\nChristians (a feature of the reforms) tried the peasants. There were\r\nno witnesses--at least not when I was present--and the case seemed to\r\ngo for or against the prisoner as he himself could persuade the sleepy\r\njudges of his innocence. The judges never asked a question; the whole\r\nevidence, _pro_ and _con_, was drawn by one Turk in a shabby uniform,\r\nwho stood before the handcuffed prisoner, questioned him, and then\r\nadvised the judges--still sleeping--of his testimony. Judgment was by\r\nno means summary; it was not ‘Who are you?’--‘Ivan Ivanoff.’--‘Guilty!’\r\nEvery Bulgar had an hour or more to talk. So slow was the process of\r\nthese courts that another amnesty took place before they had tried half\r\nthe prisoners. Nevertheless, the number of condemned was large, and for\r\nmany months the weekly steamer which conveys political prisoners into\r\nexile was crowded on touching at Salonica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXILES, SHIPPED WEEKLY FROM SALONICA.]\r\n\r\nThe week we spent at Salonica after the dynamiting bristled with\r\nincident. The days we devoted to gathering news and material for\r\n‘letters,’ and the nights we put in ‘writing up.’ In making our\r\nrounds of the town it seemed that every sentry would have his turn\r\nchallenging us, and the Turkish post office insisted on searching me\r\nbefore I entered, and relieving me, for the time being, of my pistol.\r\nEven at night we were not free from the investigation of the now\r\ncautious authorities. Every patrol passing the Angleterre would rouse\r\nthe house and ask why the candles burned at so late an hour in the room\r\nwe occupied. We had just time each day to swallow a hasty dinner at the\r\nlittle restaurant opposite the hotel when the ‘all in’ hour, sundown,\r\narrived. But we took a supper of _yowolt_ (a kind of curdled milk) and\r\nbread to our rooms to eat at midnight. At six o’clock each morning\r\nwe were on our way to the railway station to hand our despatches to\r\nthe Consular kavass. Of course we could trust none of our ‘stuff’ to\r\nthe Turkish telegraph or post offices. For one thing, no report was\r\npermitted to pass the censor which did not in all cases describe the\r\ninsurgents as ‘brigands,’ and this word throughout a despatch would\r\nlend a false colour to it. There is, besides, no assurance that either\r\na letter or a telegram will ever reach its destination through the\r\nTurkish institutions; and so we had deposited a sum of money with the\r\ntelegraph operator at Ristovatz, the Servian frontier station, and sent\r\nour despatches to him by either of the messengers who take the mails of\r\nthe English, French, and Austrian post offices to the frontier daily.\r\n\r\nOne morning, after we had worked all night and got to bed only\r\nafter delivering our despatches safely into the hands of the French\r\nmessenger, a skirted kavass with a tremendous revolver, we were rudely\r\nawakened at nine o’clock by a continuous booming of cannon in the\r\nharbour. We knew it was a foreign fleet, and had rather looked forward\r\nto its arrival, but we were perfectly willing to have it stay away\r\naltogether rather than come at this hour. It boomed on and on until\r\nthere was nothing for us to do but get up and go to see how many\r\nwarships and whose they were. We dressed and went up on the broad\r\nterrace of the Cercle de Salonique, to which the American Consul had\r\ngiven us cards. There we breakfasted and watched them sail into the bay\r\nunder Olympus, still snow-capped, standing higher than the cloud line,\r\nhis smaller companions tapering off to his right and left.\r\n\r\nThere was a coarse rumble as the heavy chain of the first warship,\r\nan Austrian, followed its anchor to a bed. For a week we watched\r\nthe Italians and the Austrians rivalling each other in this naval\r\ndemonstration. An Austrian, then an Italian; then three Austrians,\r\nthree Italians--at the end of the week nearly a score of foreign ships\r\nswung on their anchors in two parallel lines, the torpedo boats close\r\nin to the shore and the big ships in deeper water. Neither nation could\r\nlet the other appear the stronger in the eyes of the Turks or, more\r\nparticularly, the Albanians.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish flagship, which has swung at anchor in the bay of Salonica\r\nfor the past ten years, floats an admiral’s colours. The admiral had\r\nbeen warned that there would be a naval demonstration in the bay, but\r\nhis Government had not informed him that every ship that entered would\r\nsalute him. In consequence he was unprepared to fire some hundreds\r\nof guns, and his ammunition was soon exhausted; so he gave orders to\r\nswitch his flag up and down twenty-one times to each foreign ship, and\r\nfor a week the Star and Crescent rose and fell at the Turk’s hind mast.\r\n\r\nAll the peoples but the Mohamedans had rejoiced at the arrival of the\r\nforeign ships, but they were all disgusted with them before they left.\r\nThe Bulgarians had thought they would all be released from prison,\r\notherwise the town would be bombarded; the Jews had thought the sailors\r\nwould hire their boats to come ashore; the Greeks had thought the\r\nofficers would dine nightly at their hotels; and the Tziganes had made\r\ntheir children learn enough words of French to beg for small coin.\r\n\r\n‘The English float no come?’ asked a Jew bootblack of me with a glance\r\nof disgust at a group of Italian sailors passing.\r\n\r\n‘What’s the matter with these fellows?’ I inquired.\r\n\r\n‘Never get drunk so much as English. Got no money anyhow.’\r\n\r\nDuring the week of sentinels and excitement at Salonica the wife of one\r\nof my friends at the American mission died. I had known them only a few\r\nmonths, but I was the only other American in the town, and was asked to\r\nbe one of the pall-bearers with several of the English residents there.\r\nThe Vali sent down a detachment of troops to prevent any disturbance,\r\nand they accompanied the funeral to the English cemetery to protect a\r\nnumber of Bulgarian women who wanted to follow the remains of their\r\nfriend to the grave. It was a strange sight--the parade of these\r\npeasants whose husbands were dead, in gaol, or in hiding, following\r\nthe hearse through the semi-deserted streets afoot, surrounded by\r\nfezzed soldiers. After them came a train of native hacks, in which the\r\nEuropean community followed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe town was resuming its normal quiet and we began to inquire for\r\nexcitement elsewhere. The Englishman in some way got a tip that trouble\r\nwas brewing in Monastir, and he and I made ready to disappear one\r\nmorning, leaving the other correspondents in the dark as to where we\r\nhad gone. It was now necessary for him to secure a _teskeré_--I already\r\npossessed one and needed but to have mine viséd. On application to his\r\nConsul for this document he was advised to designate himself ‘artist,’\r\nas the word ‘correspondent’ always shocks the Turk. (The correspondent\r\nrepresented the _Graphic_.) But the Turkish official must have a reason\r\nfor everything, and the first question of the dignitary who drafts the\r\npassports was, why an _artiste_ desired to go to Monastir.\r\n\r\n‘To see the country--among other things,’ said the Englishman. ‘I\r\nunderstand it is very fine.’\r\n\r\n‘The country is magnificent,’ replied the Turk, ‘but the café-chantants\r\nare all closed now.’\r\n\r\nThe café-chantant _artiste_ was the only artist known to this\r\nenlightened official.\r\n\r\nWe had thought that all the live insurgents had left Salonica and we\r\nwere going on their trail. But one desperate dynamiter had remained\r\nin town, and was doomed to die before we left. He chose the hour and\r\nplace himself: about two o’clock of the day before we left, within a\r\nstone’s throw of the Angleterre. It was a rainy day, and we--the whole\r\ncorps of correspondents--were lingering over our lunch at the time,\r\nidly speculating on ‘What next?’ when several shots rang out almost\r\nin front of the place. At the first everyone jumped up, expecting\r\neither a dynamite attack on ‘Europeans’ or a massacre of Christians.\r\nWe were both. But the firing stopped almost the instant it had begun,\r\nand we moved towards the door. There the crowd hesitated for a moment,\r\nbut those--of us behind--forced the front file out into the street.\r\nCuriosity soon got the better of fear, and three minutes after the\r\nshooting we were ‘on the spot.’\r\n\r\nIt was only seventy yards up the street from the Hôtel d’Angleterre.\r\nThe body of a boy some eighteen or twenty years of age lay pale and\r\nlifeless in a gutter half full of dirty water. There was a short pause\r\nbefore anyone ventured to approach him; there was an infernal machine\r\nunder his coat. Then a black soldier went up, felt the body carefully\r\nand relieved it of an iron bomb and two sticks of dynamite. He had no\r\nsooner done this than two other Asiatics approached the body, and one,\r\nwith blood trickling down his face, set upon it with the bayonet,\r\nmuttering Turkish--curses, I imagine--through his clenched teeth.\r\nBefore he had struck many blows, however, an officer caught hold of his\r\nsword arm and violently pushed him back; and for a moment there was a\r\nrapid argument, followed by a tussle. The other white soldier raised\r\nhis gun, butt downwards, to smash in the victim’s face, but the negro\r\nthrust him back too. In a few minutes four soldiers and the officer\r\ncame and dragged the body through the mire across the street, and the\r\nnow freed Asiatic, with drawn bayonet, unable to control himself, began\r\nagain his curses, and dealt three blows at the stomach of the victim\r\ntrailing through the mud. Then he put his bayonet between his teeth and\r\ntook hold of the feet, and helped to throw the dead Bulgar upon a Jew’s\r\ncart standing by. The old Jew drove off rapidly; he had cut a cabman\r\nout of a job.\r\n\r\nThe slaughtered youth was said to have come from a small town up the\r\nrailroad. He was a Bulgarian school teacher. In his attempt to blow\r\nup the telegraph office (this was his object) he went down to the\r\nplace dressed as a European. He loitered about his goal, which aroused\r\nsuspicion, and when he collected his courage and started to enter, one\r\nof the sentries at the door challenged him. The young man, holding a\r\npaper in his hand and feigning indignation, is said to have exclaimed,\r\n‘Let me pass! I want to send off this telegram.’ The guard answered,\r\n‘I must search you before you go in.’ Here the young Bulgar thrust\r\nhis hand into his pocket for a bomb, but before he could withdraw it,\r\nthe stalwart guard, who was twice the size of the Bulgar, grabbed him\r\nby the throat, threw him on his back, and sent two balls into him. A\r\nletter was found on the boy’s body stating that he had successfully\r\ncarried out one piece of dynamiting and hoped to accomplish this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMONASTIR AND THE GREEKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe train to Monastir is very slow: it takes the best part of a day to\r\ngo about a hundred miles. The conductor, somewhat of a wag, informed\r\nus that, as the natives are accustomed to paying for transportation\r\nby the hour, they would probably drive if the railways charged more\r\nthan the carriage-man’s rate per hour. But this is not the only reason\r\nthe journey consumes such a length of time. Wherever there are two\r\nways between towns the track invariably takes the longer. This, we\r\nwere told, is due to the fact that while the Sultan seeks to limit\r\nthe number and the terminal lengths of railways in his dominions, the\r\nSublime Porte sees fit to subsidise these undertakings of foreign\r\ncompanies according to the mileage covered.\r\n\r\nOur train pulled slowly out of Salonica at 8 A.M., and dragged slowly\r\ninto Monastir at 5.45 P.M., half an hour late in spite of the liberal\r\ntime-table. The trip, however, was most interesting. There is a line of\r\nold Roman watch-towers along the coast, dilapidated things resembling\r\nRoman ruins in England. They are now inhabited by Turkish frontier\r\nguards, to whom Greek smugglers must pay tribute in order to bring in\r\ngoods duty free. Behind these towers, across the bay, stands Olympus.\r\nThe historic mountain, already forty miles away, is still to remain\r\nin view until we cross the Vardar Valley and burrow into the hills.\r\nWe had got to know Olympus well, and looked upon him as a sort of\r\nsentinel of civilisation here on the border ’twixt East and West. The\r\nold fellow had carried us back to schooldays, and jogged our memories\r\nof the ancient Greeks. Of course, we appreciated his company on this\r\njourney inland, and admired the majestic manner in which our old\r\nfriend travels. He goes along with the train just as the moon does;\r\npassing over minor objects, towns, forests, and insignificant things,\r\nand keeping steady pace with you, until a close range of unworthy\r\nhills suddenly cuts him off from view. Distance lends enchantment, but\r\nproximity makes importance.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the plain the train begins to climb over a watershed,\r\nand gradually winds a tortuous way, up, up, up to the snow and the\r\nclouds. In a few hours the line is a succession of alternating tunnels\r\nand bridges--passages through the mountain-tops and spans across the\r\nchasms. At every tunnel’s mouth and at every bridge was a little group\r\nof tents and brush huts, from which ragged guards emerged to get the\r\nbag of bread the train dropped off. A sea of mountains rolls away on\r\nall sides. On the nearer slopes rectangular carpets of yellow corn and\r\nred and white poppies spread out at irregular intervals. On the second\r\nline the fields are less distinct. Further off the mountains blur out\r\ninto blue and grey, and finally mix colour with the clouds. Shortly\r\nafter midday the train threads the eye of a high peak and emerges in\r\nsight, across a far valley, of Vodena--Watertown. It does not descend\r\nto the plain and climb again, for that, besides being impracticable, is\r\nthe most direct route to the town. Around the mountain sides the train\r\nwinds for an hour through more tunnels and over more bridges, but in\r\nview, when in the open, of a score of slender silver ribbons trailing\r\ndown a precipice that falls abruptly from the town’s edge. Passing back\r\nof Vodena the track crosses the mountain streams, which tumble through\r\nthe streets of the town on their way to the fantastic falls.\r\n\r\nNot the least of the charms on this road to Monastir is Lake Ostrova, a\r\nmountain bowl of clear green water. The train does not cross the lake,\r\nfor again that would be too direct; it circles the shore at the base\r\nof the mountains, taking, of course, the longer way round. To bridge\r\na Macedonian lake is like putting a pot-hat on an American Indian. It\r\nis a legend in the Caza of Ostrova that the lake rose suddenly from\r\nsprings about a hundred years ago; and perhaps there is some truth in\r\nthe record, for at one end, on an island just large enough to hold a\r\nmosque, stands a lone minaret--all that remains, it is said, of a once\r\npopulous village. There is always incentive for wild imagination in\r\nMacedonian mountains. Several regiments of Albanians were camped at\r\nthe village on the shore of the lake, and every man of them gathered at\r\nthe station to meet our train. A field of white fezzes swept away from\r\nthe car window in every direction for a hundred yards. When Albanians\r\nappear Slav peasants often suspend business. Generally fresh trout,\r\n‘still kicking,’ are to be had at Ostrova station, but this day not a\r\nsingle native ‘dug-out’ was drawn up on the beach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON A MACEDONIAN LAKE.]\r\n\r\nAboard our train was an Albanian bey returning with his little daughter\r\nfrom a pilgrimage to Mecca. Friends were gathered at several stops\r\nto greet him. They threw their arms about him and pressed faces with\r\nhim, but none of them noticed the girl. She was a marvel of beauty,\r\nprobably ten years of age, and yet, of course, unveiled. Her hair,\r\nwhich hung in a single bunch under a soft blue homespun kerchief, was a\r\nrich auburn--though the roots of it were black. Her finger-nails were\r\nlikewise dyed with henna. She wore richly figured bloomers, like the\r\ngypsies, and a loose, sleeveless jacket of blue over a white blouse. We\r\ntold the Albanian his child was pretty, which caused him to exclaim in\r\nalarm, ‘Marshalla!’--May God avert evil! It is bad luck in Turkey to\r\nreceive a compliment.\r\n\r\nWe asked the Albanian if he had many children. ‘One children and three\r\ngirls,’ was the reply.\r\n\r\nAt Monastir we surrendered our _teskerés_ to a Turkish official, to be\r\nretained until we left town, and took a carriage to the Hôtel Belgrade.\r\nThis is the only hotel in the town; the others are all khans. In spite\r\nof the immortal William, there is much in a name. By its presumption\r\nthe Hôtel Belgrade got the patronage of both the correspondents and the\r\n‘reformajis’--as the reforming officers and officials were derisively\r\ndubbed. There were some queer characters among us. A ‘special\r\ncommissioner’ of the _Daily News_ took his mission so seriously that\r\nhe never smiled, and always wore a silk hat. The other Englishman\r\nsuggested an opera hat for cross-country travel, in the hope that his\r\ncompatriot would spring it in the company of an Albanian and get shot.\r\nAn Italian official of the Ottoman Bank had taught himself English,\r\nand was enraptured when we arrived. It was with much pride that he\r\naddressed us at supper. But we did not recognise the language, and\r\nexpressed in French our unfortunate ignorance of foreign tongues. ‘That\r\nis your own tongue,’ said the Italian; but even of this we understood\r\nnot a word. The man drew a pencil from his pocket, and on the back of a\r\nletter wrote:\r\n\r\n‘I am speaking English.’\r\n\r\nWe were astounded.\r\n\r\n‘Perhaps I do not pronounce correctly,’ he wrote next. ‘I have learned\r\nthe noble language from books.’\r\n\r\nThe hilarious Englishman gave the unhappy Italian his first lesson at\r\nonce. He took the pencil, and wrote:\r\n\r\n‘Always pronounce English as it is not spelt; spell it as it is not\r\npronounced.’\r\n\r\nThe Italian was an earnest student, and soon made progress. Before\r\nwe left the hotel he was interpreting to the proprietor for us. One\r\nday the Englishman asked if there was any chicken on the bill of fare.\r\nThe Italian conversed with the proprietor for a few minutes, and then\r\ninformed us that there was ‘a kind of a chicken.’\r\n\r\n‘What kind of a chicken?’ chirped the Englishman; and the special\r\ncommissioner of the _Daily News_ almost smiled.\r\n\r\n‘It is a--what do you call it?--a goose, sir.’\r\n\r\nThe Italian went with us to the bazaars one morning to look at some\r\nrugs, but he took us only to second-hand dealers, until we protested.\r\n\r\n‘We do not want old rugs,’ we said.\r\n\r\n‘Oh,’ said he, ‘you want young ones.’\r\n\r\nThe Hôtel Belgrade was, as you might imagine, kept by a Servian. It\r\nwas a most depressing place--except for the amusing Italian. Its bare\r\nboard floors were regularly scrubbed, and we seldom found extraneous\r\nthings in either the food or the beds. Nevertheless, there was a bad\r\nsmell about the place, from the garbage in the street, and much noise\r\nfrom miserable dogs in front of it, which came for the garbage. The\r\nfront door was braced with stout props, which were set in place every\r\nevening soon after twelve o’clock, Turkish, this being sundown; but\r\nthe doors of the rooms were without bolts. The steep staircase was\r\nlighted with smoky kerosene lanterns, the bedrooms were supplied with\r\ntallow candles. The dining-room was a gruesome place. Life-size prints\r\nof King Alexander and Queen Draga stared down from the badly papered\r\nwalls. This was before the assassination of the monarchs; but after the\r\nevent (which called me to Belgrade) they hung there still. There was no\r\nsentiment in the matter; the proprietor simply possessed no portrait of\r\nKing Peter, and was not prepared to lay out money for new pictures.\r\n\r\nAt the open door to the yard stood a smelly ram that had become\r\nbow-legged from its own weight. It was so fat it could hardly waddle,\r\nbut it was never required to walk further than the length of a short\r\nrope. The unfortunate animal was afflicted with the capacious appetite\r\nof both goat and pig; it was able to eat anything and continually.\r\nAnd everybody fed it. It got the uneaten vegetables from the ‘potage\r\nlégumes,’ fins of the fish if there was ‘poisson’ on the menu, bits of\r\ndaily lamb; even the stumps of cigarettes thrown in its direction were\r\npromptly swallowed. Some of us protested to the proprietor, and offered\r\nto buy the creature if he would have it killed. ‘What!’ exclaimed\r\nthe horrified Servian; ‘kill my luck? Stomackovitch has brought good\r\nfortune to this house for eleven years!’ The bow-legged ram with the\r\ninsatiable capacity had been tied in the hotel yard ever since it was a\r\nfrisky lamb.\r\n\r\nI became disgusted with the hotel, and tried the khans; but I had\r\nrun out of Keating’s. I had made friends with the missionaries (one\r\nneeds no introductions in Macedonia), and by frequent visits at the\r\nmission I found that they were in the habit of having waffles for\r\nbreakfast, Indian corn for dinner, and home-made biscuits for supper.\r\nThese attractions of the American home were irresistible, and I\r\napplied to Mr. and Mrs. Bond for permanent board and lodging. Now, the\r\nmissionaries are Puritan people, and while more than anxious for the\r\nsociety of a fellow-countryman, they hesitated at taking me, fearing\r\nthat perhaps I was afflicted with evil habits; so before adopting me\r\nthe dear old people put me to a test.\r\n\r\n‘We allow no strong drink in this house,’ remarked Mr. Bond.\r\n\r\n‘So I perceive,’ I replied.\r\n\r\n‘Do you smoke?’\r\n\r\n‘I can do without tobacco quite easily.’\r\n\r\nCondition three was a compromise. ‘We do not send for our post on\r\nSundays,’ said the missionary.\r\n\r\n‘I can go for my own letters.’\r\n\r\n‘You attend service?’\r\n\r\n‘I do.’\r\n\r\nThe room I got for my goodness was on the first floor. It held a big\r\ndowny bed, wherein one could roll about without danger or discomfort.\r\nThere was a rug on the floor, on a washstand a china wash-bowl and\r\npitcher instead of the petroleum tin with faucet in the _khan_ yards\r\nfor guests who wash. My window looked out on the garden and over the\r\nred-tiled roofs of the town, covered with storks’ nests.\r\n\r\nThe residence was situated on the border between the Turkish and the\r\nBulgarian quarters. Round the corner, in the upper room of a large\r\nwooden building, was the church; and in the next street was the girls’\r\nschool, conducted by two American women with the assistance of several\r\nBulgarians educated at Samakov.\r\n\r\nThe number of people in the congregation was less than a hundred. They\r\nwere all Bulgarians, with the exception of one family of Albanians.\r\nThe school was quite prosperous, having several grades and boarding\r\npupils who came from a hundred miles around. Among the scholars were\r\nGreeks from Florina, and Vlachs from Krushevo, as well as Bulgarians\r\nand Albanians, all, of course, Christian girls. The school was a sort\r\nof select seminary for the better classes.\r\n\r\nTsilka, husband of Mrs. Tsilka, his wife, and ‘the brigand baby,’ born\r\nin captivity, lived near our house. Tsilka assisted Mr. Bond in his\r\nduties, and Mrs. Tsilka taught at the school. They both spoke English\r\nquite well, and the accounts they gave of the long captivity and the\r\nransom were extremely exciting. It was never dull at the mission.\r\nThere was always something interesting going on. My visit began in the\r\nheight of a panic. Rumour, which stalked rampant after the Salonica\r\noutrages, planned trouble for Monastir on the following _fête_, St.\r\nGeorge’s Day. The Vali, under instructions from the Governor-General,\r\ngot his garrison in readiness to combat an attack by dynamiters, and\r\nthe civilian Mohamedans, being in an ugly mood, prepared to assist\r\nthe soldiers. No attack came from the Bulgarians, but the promises of\r\ntrouble were fulfilled nevertheless. Turks all ready, it required\r\nbut a signal to start them to work. The signal came in a row between a\r\nTurk _khanji_ and a Bulgar baker over payment for a long due account.\r\nThe Bulgar died, and the mob of bashi-bazouks slaughtered some forty\r\nother ‘infidels’ before being dispersed by the soldiers, who at first\r\nassisted them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GREEK.]\r\n\r\nThen came the panic. Christians closed their shops and barred their\r\ndoors, and the streets were deserted except for Mohamedans, who, one is\r\nled to believe, would shoot a foreign _giaour_ as quickly as they would\r\na native infidel. The Vali sent a soldier to escort the Englishman\r\nand me, being _giaours_, on our daily trips through the streets. The\r\ntrooper was given us for protection from the Bulgarians, but we kept\r\nour eye fixed upon him, for he was an armed Mohamedan.\r\n\r\nThere was also a guard assigned to duty at the mission. This was a\r\nyouthful Turk, who brought with him a strip of matting in lieu of a\r\nprayer rug. He came one morning at nine o’clock, and nine o’clock next\r\nmorning found him still at his post. We discovered the poor fellow\r\nweeping, and asked the cause. He had been posted here to guard the\r\nmission, and told to remain until relieved. His task was severe, as\r\nhe had brought no food. The missionaries fed him, and he remained\r\ntwenty-four hours longer before another soldier came to take his place.\r\nThe object of putting a guard in front of the mission was twofold.\r\nOne day he arrested a peasant who came to the mission with a bundle\r\nand went away with a large piece of brown paper neatly folded in his\r\nhand. This piece of paper, in which the economical peasant had brought\r\nback my week’s washing, was the evidence produced against him. It was\r\ncarefully saved, and shown to the Vali. The washing-list was written\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nTo go about the town at night was thrilling. The patrols and sentinels\r\nhad orders to arrest--and later to shoot--any man discovered on the\r\nstreets without a lantern. Several times we were invited to dine at\r\nthe Consulates, and the Consuls sent their kavasses with a lantern to\r\nescort us. As we proceeded down the streets the challenges would come\r\nfrom a hundred yards away, and our Albanian trusty would reply in a\r\ndeep commanding tone. Even our own guard would jump to his feet on our\r\nreturn as the light of the lantern turned the corner of our narrow\r\nstreet. If nightfall overtook ox-teams or buffalo-carts within the\r\ncity, the horned beasts were unyoked where they were, blanketed and\r\nfed, and their masters slept in the carts. It was uncanny stumbling\r\ninto munching beasts at night.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when a fight had taken place in the neighbouring hills,\r\na line of cavalry ponies, led by their masters, would pass down the\r\ncobble-stone road back to the mission bringing the wounded soldiers\r\ninto the caserne. Often the men were mortally wounded and had to be\r\nsupported on the backs of the stumbling ponies. This was a gloomy\r\nspectacle. It was peculiar to the night, for the Turks never brought in\r\ntheir wounded till the streets were deserted; they are sensitive over\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\nDuring an anxious period in Monastir there came around an anniversary\r\nof the Sultan’s accession day. The streets were beflagged with Star\r\nand Crescent, and Turkish designs in night-lights were arranged on the\r\nhills. The day before the celebration long lines of soldiers made their\r\nway from the camps and casernes to the various town ovens, each with a\r\nwhole lamb, dressed ready for baking, in a huge pan on his shoulder.\r\nIt was a curious sight to see these preparatory parades pass down the\r\nstreets with the potential dinner. This, indeed, was the only parade to\r\nhonour the Padisha, for on the anniversary day itself all ‘infidels’\r\nbraced the bars behind their doors, and Mohamedans remained in their\r\nhomes by order of the Vali; and only a doubled guard remained in the\r\nstreets, to be ready for an insurgent surprise. At night we left the\r\nhouse and crossed the street to the school, and after putting out all\r\nthe lights--a precaution of the ladies--climbed to the top of the house\r\nto see the illuminations on the hills. Not a sound was to be heard over\r\nthe entire city.\r\n\r\nBut no matter how intense the quiet in Monastir, there was always one\r\nhour of the day when a fearful row raged. That was the hour the British\r\nConsul took his daily walk. The Consul was a Scot, McGregor by name,\r\nwho owned a British bulldog and employed an Albanian kavass. The latter\r\nis common to Consuls, but the bulldog was a novel and disturbing\r\nelement. As the fatted pup strode the narrow streets between his\r\nmaster and his master’s man, a wave of protest from the native canines\r\nfollowed in his wake. The native dog, like the native Mohamedans, is\r\naverse to permitting an outsider within his sacred precincts; but,\r\nunlike the Turk, the dog is not required to brook the insult in peace.\r\nWhenever a protracted dog-fight passed down the semi-deserted streets,\r\n’twas known that the British Consul was out for his daily walk; and\r\nwhen the disturbance came towards the mission, the hired girl was sent\r\nto put the kettle on for tea.\r\n\r\nThere were always visitors at the mission, and sometimes they were\r\npeculiar people. One morning a forlorn native appeared at the door\r\nwith a dejected wife and two miserable children; they stood in a\r\nrow, salaaming submissively with their thin hands crossed upon their\r\nempty stomachs. We went out to inquire their business, and heard the\r\nfollowing not unusual story. The man was unfortunately a Bulgarian, and\r\nfor that crime had been cast into prison in the general incarceration\r\nof his race. During his confinement his shop had been plundered by\r\nbashi-bazouks, and now he had nothing to live on, and nobody would give\r\nhim work. (It was a case of ‘No Bulgars need apply’; men who employed\r\nBulgarians were suspected of sympathy with the insurgents.) This Bulgar\r\nhad called at the mission--here he showed some embarrassment--to\r\nsee how much money he would receive if he and his family became\r\n‘Americans’! This missionary explained that the Protestant Church\r\ndid not offer pecuniary inducements and other mundane rewards for\r\nconverts, as did the Greek, Bulgarian, Servian, and Rumanian Churches,\r\nand told him that he would not become an American if he chose to join\r\nthe Protestant Church. The missionaries had a British relief fund at\r\ntheir disposal at this time, and out of it gave the man a couple of\r\nmijidiehs. He was made to understand, however, that this beneficence\r\nwas a gift, pure and simple, and in no way meant as a bribe to induce\r\nhim to leave the Orthodox Church. It is difficult for the Macedonian to\r\nsee why men give up comfortable homes in happy countries to come out\r\nand live in a land like theirs.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion we received a visit from a more enlightened\r\nMacedonian. He, too, was a Bulgarian, so he said; and in the same\r\nbreath told us that he had two brothers, one of whom was a Servian and\r\nthe other a Greek. This peculiar phenomenon, prevalent in many parts of\r\nMacedonia, here came to my notice for the first time. I was puzzled,\r\nand asked how such a thing was possible. The Macedonian smiled, and\r\nexplained that his was a prominent family, and, for the influence their\r\n‘conversion’ would mean, the Servians had given one of his brothers\r\nseveral liras to become a Servian, while the Greeks had outbid all the\r\nother Churches for the other brother.\r\n\r\nOne day Mr. Bond filed a despatch at the telegraph office which\r\nbrought us a call from the police. A reunion of the missionaries of\r\nEuropean Turkey was taking place at Samakov, and the Monastir staff,\r\nthinking it unwise to go to Bulgaria at this particular moment, sent a\r\nmessage to the assembly reading ‘Greetings in the name of the Lord.’\r\nThe telegraph clerk accepted the despatch and the money. Three days\r\nlater a gendarme called at the mission to ascertain who this Lord was.\r\nMr. Bond explained to him at length, but the Turk was suspicious, and\r\ncarefully cross-examined the missionary. He wanted to know particularly\r\nif the Lord for whom this telegram was being sent, and who must\r\ntherefore be in Monastir, was either a Russian or an Austrian. When\r\nthe missionary informed him that the Lord had been a Jew, the Turk was\r\nsurprised, but went away without further inquiry. Next day, however,\r\nhe called again, and asked if Mr. Bond would kindly put the statements\r\nhe had made in writing for the _bimbashee_. The missionary wrote out\r\na brief statement, pointing out that the Koran mentioned the Man in\r\nquestion. But the telegram was never sent, nor was the payment for it\r\never refunded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BIT OF OLD MONASTIR.]\r\n\r\nQuite as subtle was the reasoning of the censor when a number of\r\nquotations from the Bible, which it was desired to print on Easter\r\ncards, were submitted to him. The censor required a thorough\r\nunderstanding of each passage before he would pass it. Receiving this\r\nhe gave the missionaries permission to publish all the texts except\r\none--that of ‘Love one another,’ this precept being contrary to\r\nthe policy of _divide et impera_, by which the Sultans have defeated\r\nthe Christian peoples, both subject races and Great Powers, for many\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn a short visit to Florina I once secured an abundance of first-hand\r\nevidence of the manner in which the great Greek propaganda in this\r\ndistrict is conducted.\r\n\r\nI went to Florina without authority, in the company of the stout Mr.\r\nReginald Wyon, correspondent of the _Daily Mail_, with the object of\r\ngetting through to Armensko, the scene of a recent massacre. Just\r\nbeyond Florina the Turks turned us back, and took us, at our request,\r\nto the residence of the Greek Metropolitan, where we hoped to get some\r\ninformation of the affair. The Metropolitan was reputed to be the\r\nmost violent propagandist in the Monastir vilayet. He had recently\r\nmade an extended tour through his district under the escort of a body\r\nof Turks, exhorting all recalcitrant Christians to return to the\r\nPatriarchate, warning them of massacre if they remained Bulgarians,\r\nand assuring them, on the authority of the Vali, immunity from attack\r\nby Turkish troops if they became ‘Greeks.’ In fear of punishment and\r\nhope of reward whole villages of terrified peasants swore allegiance to\r\nthe Patriarchate, and their names were duly written in a great book.\r\nArmensko was one of the villages visited.\r\n\r\nFor thus counteracting the work of the Bulgarian committees, and also,\r\naccording to the insurgents, for serving the Turkish Government as a\r\nchief of spies, the bishop was condemned to death by the ‘Internal\r\nOrganisation.’\r\n\r\nAt the time of our arrival the bishopric was garrisoned with Turkish\r\ntroops. There were probably forty curly-bearded, hook-nosed, ragged,\r\ngreasy Anatolians--the same fellows, as far as one could see, who had\r\nheld us up one night at Salonica--quartered in the house. They had\r\npossession of the lower floor, and their mats were spread throughout\r\nthe vast hall, and a large room at one side resembled an arsenal. The\r\nAsiatics lolled about the steps and slept in the hall, and barely moved\r\nfor us to pass. We picked our way among the reclining forms, climbed\r\nthe steep steps, and stalked through a broad bare corridor, where our\r\nfootfalls sounded like thunderclaps, to a reception-room, of which the\r\nonly furniture was several small round coffee-stools. The walls were\r\nhung with Turkish rugs, of an indifferent quality, behind the usual\r\ndivans, which were part of the construction of the building. The Turks,\r\nas is their way, and the other occupants of the house because the\r\nbishop was taking a siesta, walked the bare boards shoeless. It was not\r\nnecessary to inform him of our arrival. A tousled head poked itself out\r\nof a door ready to say something a bishop shouldn’t, but, spying us,\r\njerked itself back. We were required to wait fifteen minutes for his\r\nholiness to don his robes.\r\n\r\nThen he appeared in a flutter of excitement. Pouring out\r\nunintelligible apologies, he rushed up to my fat friend, being the\r\nelder, threw his arms around him, and smacked him twice on each round\r\ncheek. I saw I was to be treated likewise--there was no hope of\r\nescape--so I bent to the ordeal, to save the bishop the trouble of\r\nmounting a stool in all his robes. After he had finished with me the\r\nloving soul stooped and gave even the little dragoman four resounding\r\nkisses.\r\n\r\nThe Metropolitan was a man of about sixty years of age, with pronounced\r\nHellenic features. His beard and hair were almost entirely grey, but\r\nboth were full and abundant still. He wore no hat, and his long hair\r\nwas drawn straight back and done in a knot, like a woman’s.\r\n\r\nThe bishop was alive to opportunities, and the unexpected arrival of\r\ntwo newspaper correspondents was a great chance for him. It quite\r\ncaused him to lose his dignity for the time being in an effort to\r\ndo the cause he espoused a service. He explained the presence of\r\nthe soldiers below; he had received a letter from the insurgents\r\ntelling him they would kill him unless he desisted from thwarting\r\ntheir diabolical propaganda. Then, as a preliminary to a lengthy\r\ndiscourse on Bulgarian atrocities, the bishop cautioned us to believe\r\nevery word he said. Indeed, we could take his word as we could that\r\nof an English gentleman, and we could publish everything he said,\r\neven if the committajis slew him for it. The old man here paused,\r\nat our request, for the interpreter to translate his remarks, and\r\nwhile interrupted, he called several attendants and despatched them\r\nin different directions--two to the Greek school for ‘professors,’\r\nanother to the kitchen for coffee and jelly, and still a fourth on\r\nanother mission--all for our enlightenment and material benefit. Then\r\nhe resumed his lecture, during the course of which the professors began\r\nto arrive, and with them came also a member of the Greek community,\r\nwho, the bishop proposed, should lodge us that night. The professors\r\njoined the bishop in blaspheming the Bulgars, but our host-to-be only\r\nsubstantiated accounts of atrocities at the appeal of the others.\r\nThree little girls, who had to be dressed, were sent into the room.\r\nThey courtesied as they entered and kissed our hands. These were the\r\norphans of a man who had been assassinated by the committajis because\r\nhe refused to contribute to their revolutionary fund. These ‘brigands’\r\nhad murdered several priests in the district, mutilated their bodies\r\nin a shocking manner, and laid them in the high-roads or before their\r\nchurches as a warning to their compatriots. No punishment, said the\r\nMetropolitan, was too severe for such fiends, and, questioned by us, he\r\ndeclared that he informed the authorities whenever he learnt that there\r\nwas a band in the district.\r\n\r\nWe asked the bishop for some information of the affair at Armensko, but\r\nthis was not in the line of his discourse, and he evidently did not\r\ncare to complicate the Balkan question for our uninitiated minds. The\r\ngreat question was the Bulgarian propaganda. He dispensed with the\r\nmassacre as a ‘mistake of the Turks; they should not have done what\r\nthey did,’ and returned to the insurgent question.\r\n\r\nWe took notes of the Metropolitan’s remarks, but he was dissatisfied\r\nthat we should permit any to go unrecorded. Finally, as we started to\r\nleave, the old man said, with a touch of resentment in his voice, ‘I\r\nwish _I_ knew English; I would write letters to the _Times_ and let the\r\nworld know the truth.’\r\n\r\nWe went home with the Greek to whose tender mercy the bishop had\r\nconsigned us for the night. A meal was already served when we arrived\r\nat his house, and his daughter, a pretty girl about twelve years of\r\nage, attired in her newest native frock, stood ready to wait on us,\r\ntrembling at the honour. But the old man drove her from the room,\r\nclosed and bolted the door, and cautiously approached our dragoman.\r\n‘Tell the Englishmen,’ he said in a whisper, ‘that the bishop is a\r\nterrible liar!’\r\n\r\nThe interpreter was an English boy, whom we had picked up at Salonica,\r\nand the peasants were not afraid to talk to him, as they would have\r\nbeen to another native. It was obvious that the old man had more to\r\nsay, but we put him off until we had eaten. Then, again carefully\r\nejecting his gentle offspring, he proceeded to inform us that the\r\nfather of the little orphans we had seen had joined an insurgent band,\r\nand then informed the bishop of the band’s plans; and the bishop\r\nhad transmitted the information to the authorities. The traitor was\r\ndiscovered, hence his death. When the Metropolitan was in Armensko,\r\nthe Greek said, he told the people that if the Turks came they should\r\ngo out and meet them and tell them they were Greeks. The Turks came,\r\nthe peasants went out to meet them, but the Turks did not give them\r\ntime to announce their national persuasion.\r\n\r\nThe troops who destroyed Armensko were commanded by Khairreddin Bey,\r\na man already notorious for his methods. According to a report of the\r\ncommittee, the Turks had met a body of 400 insurgents at Ezertze and\r\nbeen defeated. At any rate, the Turks turned back towards Florina, and\r\non their way passed through Armensko, a village of about 160 houses.\r\nWithout warning they fell upon the inhabitants, slaughtered about 130\r\nmen, women, and children, and plundered and burned the houses. Some\r\nRoman Catholic sisters of charity, who conduct a free dispensary at\r\nMonastir, secured permission from the Governor-General to proceed to\r\nArmensko and relieve the wounded. They arrived a week after the affair,\r\nand found as many as sixty living creatures huddled together in the two\r\nchurches, the Greek and the Bulgarian, which, though plundered, had not\r\nbeen destroyed. The human bodies had all been buried, but the carcases\r\nof burned pigs, horses, and cows were still lying among the ruins,\r\ndecomposing and befouling the atmosphere. The sisters, whom we saw\r\nafter their return, said that some revolting crimes had been committed\r\nupon the women. They gave the foreign Consuls at Monastir details of\r\nthe affair, and the Governor-General was indignant, and permitted them\r\nto go to the relief of no more massacred villages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORTHODOX PRIESTS.]\r\n\r\nThe sisters brought the survivors to Florina, and those severely\r\nwounded they took on to Monastir. The peasants were all the same\r\npeople; the same blood coursed through their veins, and they spoke the\r\nsame language, a corrupted Bulgarian, their vocabularies containing\r\nsome Greek and many Turkish words; but some were ‘Greeks,’ and some\r\nwere ‘Bulgarians.’ The ‘Greeks’ were received by the Greek hospital,\r\nbut admittance was refused those who had rejected the offer of the\r\nMetropolitan of Florina to become ‘Greeks,’ and there was nowhere else\r\nto take them but to the Turkish hospital.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the Sultan do not love one another.\r\n\r\nThe rivalry between the racial parties--they cannot be defined as\r\nraces--works death and disaster among the Macedonian peasants.\r\nBulgarian and Greek bands commit upon communities of hostile politics\r\natrocities less only in extent than the atrocities of the Turks.\r\nSometimes Servian bands enter the field.\r\n\r\nBut the propagandas also greatly benefit the people. The Bulgarian,\r\nGreek, Servian, and Rumanian schools--tolerated by the Government\r\nbecause they divide the Macedonians--give the peasants an education\r\nwhich they would not acquire at the hands of the Turkish Government.\r\nIn the large centres the ‘gymnasiums’ offer the inducements of higher\r\neducation, and in some cases music and art, for which professors are\r\nbrought from Budapest and Vienna. Children are often supplied with\r\nclothes, boarded, and lodged without charge.\r\n\r\nAll this effort is to possess the greatest share of the community\r\nwhen the division of the country comes. As far as the peasants are\r\nconcerned, I believe it would make very little difference whom the\r\ncountry goes to, as long as the Government is liberal and equitable.\r\nIndeed, I found sympathy with the Bulgarian cause among many Greeks,\r\nVlachs, and Servians, simply because the Bulgarians are fighting the\r\nTurks.\r\n\r\nThe Greek clergy and other propagandists worked hard to influence us.\r\nThey brought documents to prove their contentions. But figures lie in\r\nTurkey. A little thing like figures never bothers one of the ‘elect’;\r\na Turk can supply official documents proving anything--a map coloured\r\nred as far as Vienna, or a census of the population showing more\r\nMohamedans in the land than there are inhabitants. And the other races\r\nto some extent copy the Turk. Some of the Greek partisans contended\r\nthat the major part of the country was peopled by Greeks, but wiser men\r\nexplained that many members of the Greek community spoke Slav languages\r\nand Vlach, but that they are Greeks, nevertheless, because their\r\nsympathies are Greek.\r\n\r\n‘The inhabitants of Normandy are not British,’ they said.\r\n\r\n‘But is not this sympathy unnatural--the work of your clergy, by means\r\nnot wholly righteous?’\r\n\r\nThey said the adhesion of the other races to the Patriarchate was\r\nentirely natural; the Bulgarians converted artificially with brigand\r\nbands.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks fear that an autonomous Macedonia--for which the Bulgarian\r\ncommittees are striving--would be annexed by Bulgaria, as in the case\r\nof East Rumelia. The Greeks, therefore, support the Turks, until such\r\ntime as Macedonia becomes Hellenic. They have been at work for a\r\ncentury converting the country. Before the creation of the Exarchate,\r\nwhen there was but one Orthodox Church in European Turkey, they strove\r\nto destroy the Bulgarian language, abolishing it from the schools\r\nand churches. When the new Church was established they stamped it\r\nschismatic; and many Bulgarians were afraid to leave the old Church,\r\nand remain to-day faithful to the Patriarchate--and members of the\r\nGreek community.\r\n\r\nSome Greek partisans claim also the Servian communities of Macedonia\r\nbecause the Servians have no autocephalous church, and all Greeks claim\r\nthe Vlach communities.\r\n\r\nThe Kutzo-Vlachs, or Wallachians, are a people akin to the Rumanians.\r\nThey speak a language similar to that of the Rumanians, evidently a\r\nLatin tongue. The kingdom of Rumania claims these people, and conducts\r\na propaganda among them to retain them, in the hope of securing\r\nterritorial compensation--a corner of Bulgaria, perhaps--at the\r\ndivision of Macedonia.\r\n\r\nUntil 1905 the Vlach churches were also under the direct control of the\r\nPatriarchate; but Rumanian influence at Constantinople then obtained\r\ntheir independence. The Greeks contested the separation violently,\r\nand sought to prevent by force the installation of the Vlach clergy.\r\nRumania, not being contiguous to Turkey, was unable to give battle\r\nwith armed bands, and declared a civil war upon Greece. Diplomatic\r\nconnections were severed, trade treaties abolished, and Greek shipping\r\nin the Danube was severely taxed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nACROSS COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nTravel in Turkey is severely restricted. If a native succeeds in\r\nobtaining a _teskeré_, or the _visé_ thereto, necessary for making a\r\njourney, there is still the deterring danger of arrest on suspicion\r\nat his destination or _en route_, in spite of his papers. If he is a\r\nnon-Moslem he is suspected of nothing worse than being a revolutionist,\r\nand is only set upon by polite police officers; but if he be Mohamedan,\r\nhe is required to deal with the spies of the Sultan. I once witnessed\r\nin Salonica the impressive military funeral of a pasha who had been in\r\nhigh favour at Court. So highly was the pasha esteemed that the Sultan\r\nsent one of his own physicians, a Greek, from Constantinople to attend\r\nhim--though, incidentally, the doctor arrived after the pasha’s death.\r\nBut the unfortunate Turk had not possessed sufficient of Abdul Hamid’s\r\nconfidence to secure for him permission to visit Constantinople--for\r\nwhich he had applied several months before--in order to have an\r\noperation performed there by competent surgeons.\r\n\r\nForeigners fare better. They may travel to the limits of the few\r\nrailway lines without serious annoyance--if they confine their stops\r\nto Consular towns. To enter the ‘interior,’ however, permission is\r\nseldom given, and Europeans (in Turkey the name includes Americans)\r\nare never allowed to leave the railways without an escort. Only on\r\none occasion did we get away from the railways with the consent of\r\nthe authorities. This was at the instance of a certain Consul, a man\r\nwho demanded things and got them. The journey was across a section of\r\nMacedonia from Monastir, the terminus of one railway, to Veles, an\r\nintermediary point on the north-and-south line. As might be supposed,\r\nthe country was comparatively quiet at the time, the crops were being\r\ngathered, and the authorities informed us (the Englishman and me) that\r\nall insurgents had been ‘suppressed.’\r\n\r\nWe rode out of Monastir perched high on Turkish saddles, at a dizzy\r\ndistance above our diminutive steeds. At first we sought to secure our\r\nlofty positions by a tight grip of the reins, but they pulled on curb\r\nbits, and so tortured our poor little ponies that we soon sacrificed\r\nour pride, gave the animals their heads, and ‘gripped leather’ until\r\nwe learned to balance. Just outside the town our escort, six mounted\r\nmen, awaited us and fell in with us without so much as a salaam. They\r\nwere the usual ragged beggars, much patched where they sat, tied up in\r\nplaces, and generally off colour. Across their faded chests stretched\r\nmany yellow stripes--in lieu of gold braid--which designated them of\r\nthe corps of _Zaptiehs_. Three of them wore shoes of the regulation\r\norder issued by the Imperial Ottoman commissary department, but the\r\nothers were more fortunate. Of these latter two possessed native\r\nwoollen stockings and charruks, and the third had a high boot on one\r\nfoot and a shoe and leather legging on the other. The leather legging\r\nhardly met about the calf to which it was applied, and lacing was\r\nnecessary to fill a slight breach, while the boot was large enough\r\nto admit a long, flute-like cigarette-holder, a tobacco-pouch, and a\r\nflint. The fezzes of this brigade were the one uniform thing other than\r\ntheir guns; they were all good, possessed tassels, and one even showed\r\nsigns of having been pressed at a not far distant date--unlike those\r\nwhich sat upon Christian heads.\r\n\r\nWe discovered early that our escort were very poor horsemen. They did\r\nnot seem to understand their animals; for though the ponies they rode\r\ncould have been managed without any bit at all, yet they all kept a\r\nheavy hand on a cruel curb. The ponies were small, and had none but\r\nnatural gaits, and the short trot was most uncomfortable unless one\r\nrose in the saddle. This the Zaptiehs were unable to do. In consequence\r\nthe horse suffered. Two at a time they took turns at riding with us\r\nat a steady trot, while the others galloped and walked alternately,\r\nthereby covering the same distances we did in the same time.\r\n\r\nA ride across Macedonia affords a wealth of interest. Your escort is a\r\nstudy in Turk; every peasant you meet is a new picture; the mud-brick\r\nhouses of the Christians and the Mohamedan _chiflics_ are curious and\r\npicturesque, and you must stop at times and absorb the scenery. You can\r\nsympathise on a journey like this with the small boy who cried because\r\nhe had so many sweets he could not eat them all. Our route the first\r\nday lay through open country, and our escort was therefore quite small.\r\nWe traversed the length of the Monastir valley and stayed the night\r\nat Prelip. It should be a happy, prosperous valley, for Nature smiles\r\non it, but it is desolate and almost deserted. The cornfields hug the\r\ntowns, and the villages hide themselves in obscure corners of the\r\nmountains. The ‘high road,’ a waggon-track, which we followed, skirted\r\none village and passed through another, but they were made up of such\r\nhuts as brigands would not stoop to enter. A sheep-dog, big framed and\r\nthick coated--but a bread-fed, skinny animal, with an uncertain lope\r\nand an unsound bark--came at us. One of the Zaptiehs drew his sword\r\nand gave it a trial swing at a low bush near his horse’s feet; but a\r\npeasant came crying after the dog, and called the brute off before it\r\ngot within reach of the Turk’s blade. This was a Turk of less religious\r\nfervour than his fellows.\r\n\r\nThe Zaptiehs smoked continually as they rode, and rolled cigarettes for\r\nus. They gave us lights from their cigarettes, but only the irreligious\r\nfellow would accept the same favour from us, for which I asked the\r\nreason. ‘They will not take fire from a giaour,’ he said.\r\n\r\nThe insurgents had boasted that the crops would not be harvested this\r\nyear, but the corn and the tobacco were already on their way to\r\nmarket. We passed Christian caravans which took the fields to give us\r\nthe road, and Mohamedan carts which made us give them the right of way.\r\nThe former were unarmed and most meek, doffing their dejected fezzes\r\nand standing abject with hands clasped on their stomachs as we passed.\r\nThe others, down to the half-grown boys, carried pistols and guns, and\r\nbore themselves like a ruling race. The Turks, however, appeared to be\r\nas poor as the Christians, and once two veiled women, gathering their\r\nfaded rags about them, even to covering their henna-tipped fingers,\r\ncame up to our horses to beg. Nevertheless, their husband, riding a\r\ndwarfed donkey, carried a revolver.\r\n\r\nThe lot of the animals in Macedonia is similar to that of the people.\r\nThe one survives on grass as the other lives ‘by bread alone.’\r\nThe peasant lies down to sleep at night in his clothes, and the\r\nheavy-saddled pack-animals are relieved only of their loads. The long,\r\nlatticed saddle, reaching from before the animal’s shoulders to his\r\nhaunches, is seldom removed. It becomes in time an integral part of the\r\nanimal, it conforms somewhat to his shape, and he gives way in places\r\nto its lines; and when it does leave a back it often brings hair,\r\nand sometimes skin, with it. The animals are not pegged out or tied\r\ntogether when the caravan halts. The system practised is to lock their\r\nfore feet with short-chained iron cuffs, or else to tie them with a bit\r\nof rope. There are various means of propelling the beasts of burden,\r\nbut only the carriage-driver uses the Western lash. A donkey is\r\ngenerally sat upon sideways, not astride, and continually beaten with\r\nthe heels; the horseman wears heavy spurs; the driver of pack-trains,\r\noxen and buffalo teams, carries a pointed stick or a staff with a nail\r\nin the end. These last instruments are gently pressed against the hind\r\nquarters, and the pressure is kept on till the animal attains the\r\nrequired speed.\r\n\r\nThe buffalo, which is a heavy creature and unable to acquire speed\r\nrapidly, lifts his long, snake-like tail and veritably twists it about\r\nthe tantalising stick. These pitiful-eyed, straight-necked, knock-kneed\r\ncreatures are larger and more powerful than the ox, and the buffalo cow\r\ngives considerably more and richer milk than the domestic variety. But\r\nthe buffalo is an exceedingly delicate creature, and requires constant\r\ncare. His hair is long, but thin and scant, and he is addicted to early\r\nbaldness on the back. In this condition his skin resembles the hide\r\nof a rhinoceros. When the weather is warm he drags his slow way along\r\nthe roads, covered with soft, slimy mud. The driver walks beside him\r\nwith a crude, long-handled dipper, and at every puddle replenishes the\r\nsupply of cooling mud. In the winter the black beast maintains the\r\nsame measured pace, but then he wears a different covering. His thick,\r\ncoarse blanket protects him from the cold--a thing of broad stripes,\r\nbrown and white, made of the same material of which his master’s cloak\r\nis woven, spun by the peasant wife, probably in the same piece of\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\nAt several places at which we stopped the peasants came to us to\r\nask medical advice for themselves and their animals, and we were\r\nexceedingly sorry that we could not prescribe for either; for their own\r\nideas of doctoring border on superstition, and seem to follow the plan\r\nof killing pain by pain. At one village we witnessed (and protested\r\nagainst) the treatment of an unfortunate horse which had, by strange\r\nmishap, swollen to an abnormal size. A stout cord was put around its\r\ntail close to the root and twisted with a stick until all circulation\r\nin the tail was stopped. Then, when the appendage had become numb,\r\na wire nail was driven into it in four places. The horse died of\r\ncomplications, including lockjaw. A horse which, at a stage of the\r\njourney, carried our luggage, possessed but one ear. We asked what had\r\nbecome of the other, and were told that it had been cut off piece by\r\npiece to cure repeated fits.\r\n\r\nThere is often to be seen in Macedonia, especially in the Monastir\r\ndistrict, a thing resembling a big bird’s-nest built on stilts.\r\nThe nestling wears a soldier’s costume and carries a gun. He is a\r\nfield guard, an institution of the Government designed to ‘protect’\r\nChristian peasants from ‘brigands,’ Albanian and Bulgarian. This he\r\noften accomplishes by becoming a member of a band of the former. The\r\nGovernor-General will show you yard-long petitions stamped with many\r\ntiny seals, the marks of the peasants, pleading that no Christians be\r\nput to guard them, as the Austro-Russian reform scheme provides. The\r\nsignatures to these petitions are not secured in the general way, by a\r\nTurk with a loaded gun; they are _bona fide_. The peasants really do\r\nnot want the protection of a half-hearted Christian, who has probably\r\nnever before handled a gun, and who will only bring disaster upon them.\r\nThe Turkish guard is a contemptuously tolerant creature. His band is\r\nstrong enough to defend the peasants from other marauders, and so\r\nlong as they pay the annual tribute of so many sheep or goats, and so\r\nmuch grain, there is no other call upon them--except for the needs of\r\nthe bird in the nest. The committee’s agents, when laying their cause\r\nbefore Europeans, will designate this bird a vulture, and tell you how\r\nhe exacts maidens of the peasants; but the Greeks, who claim to be the\r\nenlightened people of the country, explain that this, to a Macedonian\r\npeasant, is not what it is to an Englishman or an American. There are\r\nalways two sides to a question.\r\n\r\nThough the revolution had not yet occurred, and the peasant population\r\nwas still engaged in peaceful pursuits, the country swarmed with\r\nsoldiers. Cavalry and infantry patrols, Turks, Albanians, and Asiatics,\r\npassed us by. Occasionally we met a guard with handcuffed prisoners,\r\nBulgarians and sometimes Albanians. Now and then a member of our escort\r\nwould meet a long-lost friend, and the old comrades would drop from\r\ntheir horses and embrace each other, pressing cheeks first one side and\r\nthen the other. We were yet an hour off from Prelip when the white\r\ntents about the town came into view. Soon we came to the cornfields.\r\nThe corn was ripe and glowing under the slanting rays of the evening\r\nsun, and here and there red poppies had wandered in to stud the golden\r\nfields. Once the road led by a milk-white field, most innocent in\r\nappearance, but covered with the deadly blooms of opium. Many houses on\r\nthe edge of the town, and some in the narrow streets, were hung from\r\nroof to ground with strings of tobacco leaves, changing colour in the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Albanians.            Bulgarians.\r\n\r\n                           CAPTIVES.]\r\n\r\nWhen we entered Prelip the natives were gathered at their gates\r\npreparatory to withdrawing for the night. It was too late for\r\nChristians to follow, and the Turks are too dignified to do more\r\nthan bestow a casual glance at any traveller. But in the morning our\r\nappearance caused a commotion in the town. Greeks left their shops,\r\nBulgarians deserted the market-place, Vlachs followed us with their\r\npack-animals, Jews and gypsies came after us, the one to sell, the\r\nother to beg of us; men, women, and children joined in our train. They\r\nfollowed us until we crossed a narrow street, at the other side of\r\nwhich only a few veiled women were visible; then the whole throng came\r\nto an abrupt stop.\r\n\r\n‘What is the matter with the crowd?’ I asked one of our guards.\r\n\r\n‘They are like the dogs,’ he replied; ‘they have their boundaries. At\r\nthis street begins the Turkish quarter.’\r\n\r\nWe walked on through the quiet, clean, Turkish quarter and came upon\r\na group of bashi-bazouks, who had been called into service as village\r\nguards, squatting by the roadway smoking. They were kind enough to\r\nrise and permit me to photograph them standing. This was rather an\r\nexceptional case; the Mohamedans generally resented my camera. A gypsy\r\nminstrel, a thing of shreds and patches, on his way to a wedding feast,\r\nprotested that the Evil Eye would be upon him if I took his likeness,\r\nbut I ‘snapped’ him while he argued. It would have been unkind to\r\ninform him.\r\n\r\nWe then followed the Tzigane to the wedding, of which, of course, we\r\nwere permitted to witness only the street celebrations, those of the\r\nmale side of the house. This took the form of an almost uninterrupted\r\ndance to the monotonous music of two reed flutes and two crude bass\r\ndrums. The flutes had a range of about three shrill chords, and the\r\ndrums had two notes apiece. With the right hand and a heavy stick the\r\ndrummers beat a slow, steady boom, while with a lighter stick in the\r\nother hand they kept up a rapid tattoo. They played by ear, of course,\r\nand the strain of a single bar of music went for hours. Monotony is\r\nbliss to the Mohamedan. A long mixed line of men gave the dance. There\r\nwere Turks with red fezzes, Albanians with white skull-caps, soldiers,\r\nand bashi-bazouks. The leader of the line, swinging a red handkerchief,\r\nled the way round a circle formed by the crowd and set the figures,\r\nwhich varied little more than the music. The dance was evidently\r\ncopied from the Bulgarian _horo_. Sometimes the leader withdrew in\r\nfavour of the second man, and now and then a man in the line would fall\r\nout, to have his place filled sooner or later. But on went the dizzy\r\ndance to the doleful sound all the afternoon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURKISH WEDDING FESTIVITIES.]\r\n\r\nMy companion trounced a Greek barber at Prelip, and I had my hair cut\r\nby accident. We had begun to look like Bulgarian insurgents, with full\r\ncrops of hair and unshaven faces, and, resolving here to abolish the\r\ndangerous likeness in so far as our beards were concerned, we repaired\r\nforthwith to the nearest barbers’. The Englishman chose a Greek\r\nbarbershop, and was shaved by a man with a characteristic nose of large\r\nproportions. At the conclusion of the ordeal he inquired the price, and\r\nwas told that he owed the sum of two piastres. He handed the Greek a\r\nmijidieh, which is worth nineteen piastres in Prelip, and received five\r\npiastres in change. At this the Englishman protested, and the Greek\r\nyielded up another small coin. But more than this no gentle persuasion\r\ncould move him to give. Among the crowd which had gathered to see the\r\n‘Frank’ shaved was one accommodating individual who spoke a garbled\r\nFrench. The Englishman enlisted his services to make known to the man\r\nwith the nose that, unless he produced the proper change forthwith he\r\nwould have his olfactory organ promptly and vigorously pulled. This had\r\nno effect, and the threat was put into execution, to the wonderment and\r\nincrease of the crowd. But nobody protested, and the Greek produced\r\nanother insignificant coin. Again the interpreter was employed, and\r\nagain without result. So again the Englishman laid his hands on the\r\nGreek, and this time so ill-used the poor man that he handed the key to\r\nhim and told him to help himself with piastres from the money drawer.\r\nThe Englishman took the proper change and departed.\r\n\r\nMy experience was less thrilling, but the disfiguring was of me. I\r\ndiscovered a Turkish barbershop, consisting of a Turk and a towel,\r\na cane-bottomed stool, and some utensils made in Austria. The shop\r\noccupied the narrow pavement with the dogs, out of the way of the\r\npedestrians. After shaving me with a heavy weapon, the Turk held up a\r\nformidable pair of scissors by way of asking if I wished to have my\r\nhair cut. For the moment I forgot that a shake of the head in Turkey\r\nmeans ‘yes,’ and a nod means ‘no’--and I shook my head. I was rescued\r\nfrom the wall against which I had been reclining during the process of\r\nshaving, and straightened up for the purpose, I thought, of having my\r\nhair combed. But the Turk, with a single clip, took off a large bunch\r\nof hair, and left me, without alternative, to be barbered in the latest\r\nPrelip fashion.\r\n\r\nThe Turk does a great many things in an opposite way to which we\r\ndo them. He writes backwards; the conductor on the horse-car at\r\nConstantinople and Salonica punches the tickets for the station at\r\nwhich one gets aboard instead of that to which he is destined; the\r\nwood-sawyer rubs the wood on the saw, which he holds between his\r\nlegs; the sailor, feathering oars, turns the blades forward instead of\r\nbackward; the officer salutes the soldier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GYPSY MINSTREL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TURKISH TRUMPETER.]\r\n\r\nIn the interior of Macedonia it is not necessary for the authorities\r\nto preserve the same show of order that is required in Consular towns,\r\nand our escort for the next stage of the journey came to the khan for\r\nus. There were a score of Zaptiehs in the charge of a fat but ragged\r\nsergeant, who gave me his name but could not write it. This is nothing\r\nextraordinary; one of the foreign officers of the reform scheme told me\r\nhe had found but two sub-lieutenants in the whole Kossovo vilayet who\r\ncould read and write.\r\n\r\nFor several hours the road led along the sides of a stream winding\r\nbetween two ridges of mountains. The mountains were said to be infested\r\nwith insurgents; this was a part of the country through which Sarafoff\r\noperated. Turks’ heads peered down at us, and silently assured us\r\nthat the road was overlooked for miles beyond. Studded over the steep\r\nslopes, wherever a great boulder protruded far enough for a footing,\r\nsoldiers were suspended between us and the clouds, which the mountains\r\noften pierced. Despite this survey of the route, five of our men\r\nstraggled out to the front, the foremost a mile in advance. As we\r\nwould descend one steep slope we could see the vanguard climbing the\r\nnext. Whenever we came to a blockhouse, always pitched on the highest\r\npeak, one of the garrison would bring us cool water from the nearest\r\nfountain.\r\n\r\nThe road was good for many miles; it had been constructed only a year\r\nbefore. But the contract had not called for bridges, so bridges there\r\nwere none, and it was necessary for us to ford every stream. But a few\r\nmonths after this excursion a war-scare set the Government to honest\r\nwork, and this and several other excellent roads, most of them leading\r\ntowards the Bulgarian border, were hurriedly completed. Millions to\r\nretain, but not one cent to maintain.\r\n\r\nNot a single village did we pass this day, only one lone wayside khan.\r\nMacedonia is sparsely inhabited. Once we came over the crest of a hill\r\nand descried a gathering of twenty or thirty men far down in a valley\r\nbelow--a little island formed by a split in a thin stream. It took us\r\nan hour to get to the island, which lay in our route, and meanwhile\r\nmen mounted their horses and rode away into the mountains, and others\r\nappeared from unseen places and came to the meeting. This was too open\r\na spot--visible from any of the surrounding hills--for brigands to\r\ndivide spoils; nevertheless the business was illicit. We got off our\r\nhorses and penetrated the crowd. In the centre sat a Turk with two\r\nsacks of cut tobacco. This he was selling direct to consumers, without\r\npaying the tax levied by the Turkish Regie. We filled pockets for two\r\nmetaleeks--a penny between us--and proceeded on our way up the opposite\r\nmountain-side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUR ESCORT FORDING A STREAM.]\r\n\r\nThis was a hard day’s ride. It would not be exact to say that we were\r\nin the saddle ten hours, for we dismounted and walked over many steep\r\nmountains, but we were on the road from six in the morning until\r\nsix in the evening, allowing two hours for halts. We passed through\r\nthe camp of an Anatolian regiment pitched beside the vast caverns of\r\nVeles, dropped down the Vardar, and crossed by the only bridge in view\r\nof many primitive wooden water-wheels. The bazaar began at the bridge\r\nand ended at a Turkish khan, at which we alighted. There was but one\r\nsleeping-room in the khan, and this chamber was equipped with six cots\r\nfilled with loose cornshucks in lieu of mattresses; there was no other\r\nfurniture in the room. We wanted to take the room and pay for all six\r\nbeds, but the landlord preferred to accommodate two Turkish friends,\r\nand offered to let us have the other four beds.\r\n\r\nWe washed at the tap of the inevitable petroleum tin in the stable,\r\nand the proprietor’s son brought us clean but exceedingly rough\r\ntowels. After our ablutions we repaired to the front of the house,\r\nwhere a dozen or more Turkish officers sat sipping coffee. The ranking\r\nman among them, an Albanian, rose as we appeared, and addressed us\r\nin French. A Turk would not have spoken without some substantial\r\nmotive. The Albanian asked where we had come from, where going, how\r\nold we were, whether married or not, as rapidly as he could put the\r\nquestions--which is polite in Turkey. We both understood that this\r\nwas all in good taste, as was also the noise the other officers\r\nmade drinking coffee. It was difficult for the Englishman, however,\r\nbound by the heavy fetters of British restraint, to reply to this\r\ninterrogatory readily and with any marked show of pleasure, and quite\r\nimpossible for him to sip his coffee in the manner of the company.\r\nBut, having come in contact with many queer people in the course of my\r\ntravels, I was experienced in such a situation, and not only answered\r\nall the Albanian’s questions with alacrity, but put them straight back\r\nto him, and while he was speaking I sucked coffee and sighed heavily\r\nafter each mouthful as though in the height of bliss. This display\r\nof good manners met with a cordial reception by the Turks, and they\r\ninvited us to dine with them at the officers’ mess--an exceptional\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\nWe went with them to their quarters in a clean Turkish house, off a\r\nnarrow street half covered by the extended second storey. We climbed\r\na bare, ladder-like staircase and entered a small, unpainted room\r\nwith many rugs on the rough boards. There was a long, covered thing\r\nlike a mattress on one side, stretching from end to end of the floor,\r\nand a high divan, likewise stretching the length of the wall, on the\r\nother side. I was weary, and the long cushion offered more excuse for\r\nreclining, so I dropped myself upon it; but the other man got upon the\r\ndivan and let his feet hang. We looked foreign to the place, I know;\r\nfor when the officers were seated there were many pairs of shoes on the\r\nfloor, but ours were the only feet to be seen, and ours were the only\r\nbare heads. Once in a while a Turk would remove his fez and rub his\r\nhead, but generally the red cap sat somewhere on the skull of its owner.\r\n\r\nA strong native drink, which changed colour like absinthe when water\r\nwas added--mastica it is called--was served by a Bulgarian boy, who\r\nshed his shoes at the door and entered in stocking feet. One of\r\nthe officers made the boy tell us what good masters the Turks are.\r\nRadishes, sliced apple, roasted monkey-nuts, and a delightful little\r\nTurkish nut were served and left in the room an hour before dinner. The\r\nEnglishman and I ate heartily of these, for we were ravenous, and it\r\nwas well that we did. When the meal came on we all drew around a small\r\nwooden table. Six of us sat in so many chairs, and the others stood\r\naround behind us, and reached over our heads for their food. We were\r\neach supplied with a hunk of bread, a fork, a spoon, and a towel, but\r\nno plates were distributed. One dish at a time was placed in the centre\r\nof the table, and removed when it was empty. The meal varied from\r\nstewed lamb to little squares of lamb toasted on sticks, going through\r\nfive courses of lamb. Then there was fruit and coffee. There was wine,\r\nand five of the Turks drank it; devout Mohamedans do not.\r\n\r\nAt this meal I failed in Turkish manners, even as the Englishman had\r\ndone previously. We were all required to stick our forks and spoons\r\ninto the single dish and dig for ourselves, and when the meat was gone\r\nto sop our bread in the gravy. But we were both continually withdrawing\r\nour forks as another man advanced his, which the Turks did not\r\nunderstand. Of the first few courses we got very little, but then the\r\nAlbanian caused the officers to give us a two minutes’ handicap at the\r\nsucceeding dishes.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner there was Turkish music--which was not pleasant. The reed\r\nflute played in the Turkish street harmonises with the character of\r\nthe country, and is not unattractive; but in a close room its monotony\r\nis inclined to put the weary travellers to sleep. The low wail of a\r\nMohamedan priest calling the ‘faithful’ from a minaret is ‘like the\r\nsighing of the pines,’ but the whine of a Turk at close quarters,\r\naccompanied by the facial contortions necessary to his nasal chant, is\r\nconducive to bad dreams. We had our revenge; the other man retaliated\r\nwith ‘Alice, Ben Bolt.’\r\n\r\nSeveral of the officers escorted us back to the khan through the silent\r\nstreet, answering the challenges of the night patrols.\r\n\r\nTwo dark figures, which followed us from the officers’ quarters,\r\nentered the khan behind us and stretched themselves on the floor\r\nbefore the door of the general sleeping-room. There we found them when\r\nwe emerged in the morning; they proved to be two soldiers to whom\r\nthe authorities had assigned the duty of ‘shadowing’ us. They told\r\nus, with much amusement, of how they had lost us the night before.\r\nArriving at the khan about nine o’clock, they were informed that we\r\nhad ‘disappeared’; the _khanji_ had not seen us leave with the Turkish\r\nofficers. This alarmed the soldiers, and they started on a search for\r\nus. They were about to report our disappearance to headquarters, when,\r\ncoming to the Turkish quarter, they heard strange sounds never before\r\nperpetrated in Veles. This was the song of ‘Sweet Alice.’\r\n\r\nIn the morning a negro merchant arrived at the khan from Istip and\r\ntold us of a fight ‘in progress’ at Garbintzi, a little village about\r\neight hours’ ride to the east. We had intended to take the train that\r\nafternoon for Uskub, but the chance of seeing a fight caused us to\r\nchange our plans. We gathered as much hurried information as we could\r\nabout the route, hired a Turkish guide, and set off for Garbintzi\r\nbefore noon. We planned to go unescorted, but this was not to be.\r\nOur guide, in pursuance of police orders, had informed the Konak of\r\nour sudden change of destination, and the _kaimakam_ despatched four\r\nZaptiehs to accompany us. We were surprised that they permitted us to\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\nBeing anxious to reach the scene of the combat as quickly as possible,\r\nwe rode rapidly over the mountains, and came to Istip about six o’clock.\r\n\r\nAn officer came up as we entered the town and greeted us like long-lost\r\nbrothers. He was a Turk, and had a mission to perform. He informed\r\nus that the kaimakam had received a telegram from Veles advising him\r\nof our approach, and instructing him to see that we were treated in\r\na manner befitting our exalted positions. The only place they could\r\noffer such worthy guests, who had so honoured Istip with a visit, was\r\nthe kaimakam’s own house. The kaimakam, I may explain, lived above the\r\ngaol.\r\n\r\nWe were presented to the kaimakam, and the official congratulated the\r\nEnglishman on belonging to that great race which had so long befriended\r\nthe Turks. To me he said he thought it wonderful that a great New York\r\npaper would send so youthful a man so many miles on so important a\r\nmission.\r\n\r\n‘How old are you?’ he asked.\r\n\r\n‘Twenty-five,’ I replied.\r\n\r\n‘You look eighteen.’ He did not ask why I wore no moustache, probably\r\nfearing it was because I could not. The Turk is a gentleman.\r\n\r\nInformation had evidently been given by our escort that we carried\r\nrevolvers, for two officers entered the room through a door at the\r\nback, drew up chairs, and seated themselves immediately behind us. But\r\nwe did not attempt to shoot the kaimakam. Another officer, perhaps the\r\nspy attached to the governor, also entered and occupied a seat beside\r\nhis quarry.\r\n\r\nThen the kaimakam brought his compliments to an end and sat silent.\r\nNobody spoke for forty seconds. We sought to end the uneasy interview,\r\nand informed the kaimakam, what we were sure he already knew, that we\r\nwere on our way to Garbintzi.\r\n\r\n‘The fight is over; the troops have just returned,’ he informed us.\r\n\r\n‘That is unfortunate,’ I replied, ‘but as we have come this far I guess\r\nwe’ll visit the scene.’\r\n\r\nBut the kaimakam guessed we wouldn’t.\r\n\r\n‘I have orders,’ he said, ‘to prevent you from going any further. You\r\nmust return to Veles.’\r\n\r\nWe suggested that the Governor-General was making a mistake; if we were\r\nnot allowed to visit Garbintzi we must conclude that the reports that\r\nmassacre and arson had accompanied the fight were true. The Englishman\r\nadded that, if the Turkish version were based on fact, it would be\r\nwell to let us verify it. But the kaimakam shook his head; he had his\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nWe left the house extremely disappointed, and on the way to the\r\nkhan--for he had said nothing about putting us up--began to think out\r\na plan for getting to Garbintzi. We went to our guide, and, feigning\r\nextreme dejection, instructed him to saddle, and be ready himself at\r\neight o’clock next morning; we were going back to Veles. An officer\r\nvisited us during the evening to ascertain what time an escort should\r\nbe ready to take us back. The information we gave him agreed with that\r\nwe had given the Turkish guide--which had been imparted to him. Putting\r\nthe question to us was only a point of politeness: the horses were\r\nbeing watched.\r\n\r\nWe rose at five o’clock next morning, dressed hurriedly, and went to\r\nthe stables. Two soldiers had slept there, and one set off at a run to\r\nthe Konak. But the hour was early for the Turks, and we got out of town\r\nwithout a soldier on our heels.\r\n\r\nWe passed the sentinels on the border of the town and rode hard in the\r\ndirection of Veles until we had passed out of sight of a blockhouse\r\nwhich stood high on a hill a few miles beyond, and would, no doubt,\r\nreport that we had fairly gone by towards the railway. It was a ride\r\nof barely ninety minutes from Istip to Garbintzi by road; with a good\r\nhour’s start, we calculated that we could get there before being\r\novertaken, even though we went by a roundabout route. But we did not\r\nreckon with our guide. When we called a halt and asked him if there\r\nwas not a road over the mountains to Garbintzi, he was frightened. He\r\nanswered that there was a way, but the road was bad, and it would take\r\nfour hours to go by it from the spot where we stood.\r\n\r\n‘Lead us over it,’ we said to the dragoman, who repeated the words to\r\nthe guide.\r\n\r\nThere was a parley of ten minutes, during which our nerves were at high\r\ntension. Every minute we expected to see a troop of cavalry coming\r\nafter us. At last we got the information. ‘He won’t go.’ There was no\r\ntime for argument, when it had taken so much time and all the Turkish\r\nwhich we had heard to convey that fatal negation.\r\n\r\n‘How much does he want?’ the Englishman demanded.\r\n\r\n‘He will not go at any price,’ came the reply. ‘He has a wife and\r\nchildren depending on him, and an officer has been to him last night\r\nand told him that he should lead us to Veles and nowhere else.’ It was\r\nno use arguing. We turned our horses’ heads towards a village of some\r\nten houses a few miles off, half way up a mountain side. The dragoman\r\nfollowed. The guide would not leave the road to Veles, literally\r\nfollowing instructions.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday, and the peasants were all in their brightest clothes.\r\nThey were dancing a _horo_, but our appearance among them broke up\r\nthe festivities. Every man, woman, and child in the village collected\r\nabout these queer travellers. They understood the dragoman’s Bulgarian,\r\nas was apparent by the state of alarm into which they fell. Not for a\r\nhundred liras, said the headman of the village, would one of them guide\r\nus over the mountains.\r\n\r\n‘Why?’ I asked.\r\n\r\n‘Why!’ came the answer, ‘the man who should take you over those\r\nmountains would be shot by the committajis, for we have refused to\r\narm. Were the Turks to find out that one of us had left here without\r\na _teskeré_, and taken you to see a village which they had destroyed,\r\nthey would come and do the same to this place.’\r\n\r\n‘Please leave us,’ they begged, as we still argued, ‘and get away\r\nbefore the Turks see you.’ Several old women began to cry.\r\n\r\nWe returned to our guide, our last card played, and said demurely,\r\n‘Lead us back to Veles.’\r\n\r\nWe made our way slowly, and waited at the next khan for a cloud of\r\ndust on our trail to develop into a troop of cavalry, who kept a close\r\ncordon about us for the rest of the journey back to the railway.\r\n\r\nDefeated we had been, but we had learned a lesson in the ways of\r\nthe Turk, who thinks his intelligence is superior to that of a mere\r\n‘giaour.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nUSKUB AND THE SERBS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter our attempt to evade the authorities we were closely watched\r\nuntil we left Veles, the police, as is their way, pretending to\r\nwait upon us only for our convenience. When we departed two mounted\r\ngendarmes accompanied us to the railway station, though we needed no\r\nprotection, and a careful sleuth, with painful politeness, assisted us\r\nin taking tickets for Uskub--an unnecessary courtesy--and went with\r\nus to the train to see, he alleged, that we secured a comfortable\r\ncompartment. There was only one first-class compartment in the train,\r\nand this was occupied by a well-dressed officer whose trousers had been\r\npressed inside out. The Turkish gentleman stood not upon ceremony, as\r\ndoes his admiring British contemporary on such occasions; he introduced\r\nhimself before we had taken our seats, immediately inquired our life\r\nhistory, and soon divulged what purported to be his. He was no other\r\nthan Hamdi Pasha, of Albanian extraction, the youngest general in the\r\nTurkish army, so he informed us, on his way to the Bulgarian border, of\r\nwhich he was military inspector.\r\n\r\nIt was raining heavily when we arrived at Uskub; nevertheless, a\r\npicked company of Nizams (regulars) was drawn up in honour of our\r\ntravelling companion, and presented arms as the train pulled in. The\r\npasha alighted, saluted, and, with us on either side of him, sharing\r\na great white umbrella, proceeded to the Hôtel Turati. Then the\r\nbedraggled band struck up one of several Sousa compositions which have\r\nbeen Orientalised for the Ottoman army, and the company marched away\r\nthrough the slush, doing the German ‘goose’ step, acquired from the\r\nKaiser’s officers in the Sultan’s service, which showy effort spattered\r\nthe mud on civil pedestrians on both sides of the narrow street.\r\n\r\nBehind the soldiers straggled several hundred Albanians, raw Redifs\r\n(first reserves), who had come up on our train in cattle-cars\r\nmarked in bold letters, in a language they knew not of, ‘8 CHEVAUX\r\nOU 48 HOMMES.’ And behind the Arnauts trailed a score of prisoners\r\nprotesting violently at being driven to gaol through the mire. These\r\nwere Christians impregnated with the sense of free men’s rights. They\r\nwere attired in ‘Francs,’ fezzes, and handcuffs--with the exception of\r\none, a priest, who wore only the manacles in common with the others,\r\napparently the conductors of a Bulgarian gymnasium temporarily out of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nBefore the school teachers paraded a grinning gypsy bearing on his back\r\na bundle of old muskets.\r\n\r\n‘See, see!’ said the pasha. ‘They were captured in arms. There are the\r\nguns.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘8 CHEVAUX OU 48 HOMMES’: ALBANIAN RECRUITS.]\r\n\r\nBut a foreign Consul, wise in the ways of the wily Government, told\r\nus that this gypsy and his parcel of rifles was the ostentatious\r\nadvance guard of every detachment of Bulgarian prisoners. The manœuvre\r\nwas designed to deceive those representatives of the Powers and\r\nnewspaper correspondents who were particularly prying.\r\n\r\nUskub is a stern place with a breath of the mountains upon it. It\r\nis but an eight hours’ journey from Salonica, but, thanks to the\r\nrestrictions of travel and intercourse, wholly free of a Levantine\r\natmosphere. It is peopled principally by Arnauts--as the Turks call the\r\nAlbanians--and Slavs, both men of character, though their morals are of\r\na peculiar code. These Albanians and Slavs are natural enemies, and of\r\nthe Slavs again there are Bulgarians and Servians, not good friends.\r\nThe Kossovo vilayet, of which Uskub is the capital, has been described\r\nas a prolongation of Albania, Servia, and Bulgaria. The provincial\r\ndelimitations of Turkey were undoubtedly designed with a view to\r\nencompassing under the same administration as many hostile elements as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe differences between the Servians and the Bulgarians of Macedonia\r\nare almost entirely a matter of education. The two races have long\r\nsince forgotten the enmity of their ancient emperors, and in five\r\ncenturies of similar suffering under a mutual monarch they have at\r\nheart but one desire. They have become assimilated to an extent in\r\nthese ages, and in some sections it is difficult to determine one\r\nfrom the other. Their language, here where the two races blend, can\r\nbe spoken of as one. They have duplicate religions, similar ideas,\r\nidentical customs. The peasants dress alike, and only the partisans and\r\npropagandists are distinguishable by their attire. A European cut of\r\nclothes is worn by those who attend the Bulgarian gymnasium, while a\r\nmilitary jacket attests the adherents of the rival school.\r\n\r\nAt one time, prior to 1878, the territorial ambition of the Servians\r\nand that of the Bulgarians did not clash. The Servians aspired to a\r\nconfederation of all Serbs, hoping for the annexation of Bosnia and\r\nHertzegovina and a union with Montenegro. But the Treaty of Berlin\r\ngave a mandate to Austria-Hungary to occupy two Turkish provinces\r\npeopled by Serbs, thereby severing the two Serb States apparently for\r\nall time. Servian nationalists were horrified at this injustice, and\r\nfrenzied attempts were made to undo this act of the famous treaty. But\r\nall efforts were unavailing against the power of the great neighbour,\r\nand in desperate fear of being shut in from the sea for ever, a petty,\r\ndwarfed State, the Servians turned from the Adriatic and faced the\r\nÆgean, and sought to acquire a right of way by that route to the world\r\nat large.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that in Macedonia only what is known as Old\r\nServia--that section of Kossovo between Uskub and Servia proper--is\r\nextensively peopled by Serbs, Servian patriots laid claim to all the\r\nSlav elements in the districts to the south, straight away to the\r\ncoast, arguing that the Bulgarians, originally a Tartar people, had\r\nbeen assimilated by the Slavs. The Servians spread their schools\r\nbeyond the territory rightly theirs, establishing gymnasiums in\r\nSalonica and Monastir to compete with the Greeks and Bulgarians in\r\nconverting the population. But below Old Servia, only purchased support\r\nof their cause was forthcoming from the people, and nowhere south of\r\nUskub did the Servian campaign seriously worry the two big propagandas.\r\n\r\nThis business of cornering communities is expensive, and little Servia\r\nwould hardly have been able to cast her claims so far except with\r\nmonetary aid from one of the ‘interested Powers,’ and the support\r\nof that Power’s agents in the distressed land. When the Bulgarians\r\nbegan to show an independent spirit, and diplomatic connections with\r\nRussia--which assumed the form of a dictatorship on the part of the\r\nboasted liberator--came to be severed for a term of years, that\r\n‘interested’ Power adopted Servia as its ward, and is still at work\r\ndisciplining the other little country that dared to dispute its honesty\r\nof motive. Russia among the Balkan States does a work similar to that\r\nof the Sultan in Macedonia; she aids the weak to rival the strong,\r\nfosters their jealousies, and maintains a dominant influence on the\r\ndistress she begets; and, unlike the Sultan, she does this in the guise\r\nof Christian sympathy.\r\n\r\nIn Uskub the Russian Consul, for ever attired in military greatcoat and\r\nMuscovite cap, and always accompanied by a brace of stalwart bodyguards\r\nbristling with weapons, snubs the retiring little Bulgarian agent, and\r\non all occasions bestows his pretentious patronage upon the Servian\r\nrepresentative. It was at Russian suggestion that the Servian schools\r\nadopted a distinctive uniform, after the manner of Russians in Finland\r\nand in other lands they have hoped to Russify.\r\n\r\nThe Austro-Russian accord on Macedonian affairs resembles a thieves’\r\nalliance--without that saving grace, however, the proverbial honour\r\nthat exists among thieves. For centuries these partners of the present\r\nhave been loitering around the gates of the European estate of the\r\nOttoman gentleman with the many wives and the torture-chamber. One of\r\nthese interested neighbours has been in the habit of rushing in to the\r\nrescue whenever a Christian cry escaped the Bluebeard’s window--always\r\nattempting to get away with something; the other, not so daring, but\r\nquite as designing, waited without the walls and made his burly rival\r\nreturn the booty or compensate him (the other) under threat of the\r\npolice. Three years ago this worthy pair allied agreed to rob the house\r\nno more, but planned to enter--and reform it!--and received a mandate\r\nso to do from the European Powers. But, in spite of the pretensions\r\nof these confederates, neither has forsaken his pet policy, which is\r\ndirectly opposed to that of the other. While the gallant Russian is\r\nengaged advocating the cause of the Serbs, his Austrian ally-in-reforms\r\nis diligently at work advancing the interests of a rival race.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic church at Uskub, a feature of the Austrian\r\npropaganda, was decorated one dusty summer day with garlands of\r\nmountain flowers and many flags. A vast Mohamedan banner floated from\r\none side of the Christian belfry and an equally large emblem of the\r\nDual Monarchy from the other; and strings of little flags, alternately\r\nTurkish and Austro-Hungarian, streamed away from the tower to the high\r\nmud walls about the churchyard. Over the door, where only the Catholics\r\nwho entered could see, hung a large print of Francis Joseph much\r\nbemedalled, and none was visible of Abdul Hamid.\r\n\r\nIt was the feast of Corpus Christi, and the Englishman and I, attracted\r\nby the Albanians converging upon the place from all directions,\r\nbetook ourselves to witness the celebration. The darkened church\r\nwas aglow with many candles around the crucified Christ, and the\r\nfourteen ‘stations of the Cross,’ set like little chapels about the\r\nchurchyard, contained life-sized pictures of the Saviour’s labour to\r\nthe Crucifixion. During the indoor service the Albanian women, veiled\r\nlike their Mohamedan sisters, occupied one side of the church, and the\r\nmen the other. In the pew of honour sat the Austrian reformajis in\r\nfull feather, the brilliant uniform of Count de Salis, chief of the\r\ngendarmerie contingent, relieved and glorified by a Salonica frock-coat\r\ncovering the venerable person of the Christian Vali, who sat next.\r\nThis decrepit representative of the Sultan was playing a game similar\r\nto that of the gaily garbed gendarmes. He was selected by the Porte\r\nseveral years ago as a co-governor with the Turkish Vali because\r\nof general incapacity and indifference to affairs. His duties were\r\nostensibly to reform the province, but he was incapable of performing\r\nthem or he would not have received the appointment. This day he was\r\ndisplaying the Christian sympathy of his Sultanic master, just as the\r\nAustrians flaunted their religious zeal before the Catholic Albanians.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the indoor service on Corpus Christi day, priests\r\nand people left the church chanting, each carrying a lighted candle,\r\nand made a tour of the ‘stations,’ kneeling and praying a few moments\r\nat each. Little flower-girls, dressed in gayest _shalvas_, preceded the\r\nprocession scattering rose-leaves. Two proud Albanian boys swung the\r\nincense lamps, and four others bore a panoply of silk over the heads of\r\nthe priests. First behind the priests came the Count and the Christian\r\nVali, and then followed the Austrian Consul and other Austrian officers\r\nand the people. The ordeal of kneeling in the grass was trying to\r\nthe trousers of the Count and painful to the rheumatic limbs of the\r\nvenerable Christian Vali, whom the Count was required to assist to his\r\nfeet on each occasion.\r\n\r\nIt was a windy day, and the candles, borne gingerly at arm’s length,\r\nsputtered, and spattered the gorgeous uniform and the ample frock-coat.\r\nThe delegates at their divine duties, wore on their faces, I must say,\r\nmost unholy expressions, and at the conclusion of the ceremony the poor\r\nold Christian with the fez presented the appearance of having eaten\r\nhis supper without stuffing the end of a napkin in his collar. Religion\r\nand politics make an unhappy mixture; they war within one like custard\r\nand cucumbers.\r\n\r\nThe presence of two unsympathetic newspaper correspondents, standing\r\nby at this ceremony, appeared to annoy the official party, and for\r\nsome time after that ‘the two English correspondents’ (of whom I was\r\none) were severely snubbed by the Austrian officers. An imaginary but\r\neffective barrier was thrown across the middle of the dinner-table,\r\ndividing the Englishmen and the Russians from the Austrians and the\r\nJews, mostly Vienna correspondents.\r\n\r\nBut there came a day when the latter, overwhelmed by curiosity, were\r\nforced to fraternise again.\r\n\r\nA strange female of daring demeanour, unheralded and alone, appeared at\r\nthe hotel. Her species had never been seen before in Uskub. Her skirt\r\nwas shockingly short, and contained a hip-pocket, from which the blued\r\nbutt of a Colt’s 44 protruded. Her hat was a duplicate of mine, and all\r\nher other garments were more like a man’s than a woman’s. Fast on her\r\nheels arrived the ubiquitous policeman with his compliments and his\r\nveiled demands for information. She possessed a _teskeré_, and gave it\r\nto him, but he was not content with this, and would have her passport\r\nwith its big red seal.\r\n\r\n‘Not much, my fine feller! You can have Abdul’s rag all right, all\r\nright, but this here document belongs to your auntie.’\r\n\r\nThe gentle police understood her not. Nicola, the Albanian waiter,\r\nattempted to interpret. He spoke a little French, but this was of no\r\navail. The Turk called in a miserable Christian (she must be Christian)\r\nwho spoke, besides Turkish and Albanian, Bulgarian, Servian, Rumanian,\r\nand Greek, but not a word of any kind had he in common with the curious\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\n‘Of what use are all my tongues!’ he exclaimed piteously, as he was\r\nkicked out by the Turk. One of the Russians offered his services.\r\nHis accomplishments comprised all the languages of Europe, including\r\nEnglish. No use. ‘The woman who speaks no human language,’ he called\r\nher; and the name clung to her.\r\n\r\nNicola saw that the fearful female belonged to none of the known\r\nraces, so when she appeared at dinner he seated her with ‘the\r\nEnglish.’ She recognised me at once, and Austrians, Russians, Jews,\r\nand the Englishman, who hailed from Yorkshire, seeing that I was\r\nable to converse with the lady, at once made use of me to present\r\ntheir compliments and make gentle inquiries. The pragmatical Russian\r\nsubsequently developed his witticism, and dubbed me the superhuman\r\ninterpreter.\r\n\r\nBetween meals the unknown prowled the town carrying a small black box\r\nwith a covered eye, which flapped at every native she met. Tziganes\r\nfled madly down the roads, Albanian women took fright, covered their\r\nfaces and scurried into their houses, and even the Turk of habitual\r\nimmobility suffered a rude shock to his equipoise.\r\n\r\nNow, the potting of a peasant and the hold-up of a native in the\r\ncrowded streets are episodes which do not disturb the tranquillity\r\nof Uskub, but the visit of an apparition from Mars is an event which\r\ndoes not take place every day. The stranger stalked through the\r\ncovered bazaar, putting the place in a panic for the time being, and\r\nclimbed the steep hill to the citadel, where the army practised at\r\nrange-shooting without cartridges--an economy in ammunition. There\r\nshe marched boldly up in front of the line of soldiers blinking at\r\nfar-off targets through the sights of empty guns, aimed the eye of her\r\nblack box at them, and snapped it. The triggers fell with a unison of\r\nclicks never before accomplished on the rifle-range. An officer of\r\nthe garrison, who had been educated in Germany, and was accustomed\r\nto strange sights, emerged from the barracks at a pace Turks seldom\r\nacquire, and established for ever his reputation for bravery by\r\nejecting the interloper. The artillery barracks was next to receive\r\nthe spook, who was caught in the act of aiming her spell-box at the\r\ncannon. She was taken into custody by the commander himself, the troops\r\nrefusing to obey orders, and detained until a fast rider could find\r\nthe Vali and learn from him whether this were not an Austrian spy in\r\ndisguise.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for the Turks; business was already at a standstill,\r\nand the garrison completely demoralised. The Vali ordered out his\r\nstate coach forthwith, and with four outriders in the shape of trusty\r\ntroopers unafraid of man or superman, made his way to the British\r\nConsulate. The preliminary compliments were cut unusually short, and in\r\nless than ten minutes the governor of Kossovo got to business.\r\n\r\n‘It will be shot, O exalted Consul,’ said the Vali, ‘if it roams\r\nat large another day. I have assigned police to follow it for its\r\nprotection, but I fear even they will be powerless to preserve it. Can\r\nyou not persuade it to depart?’\r\n\r\nThe Consul tapped his head and rolled his eyes, after the manner best\r\nunderstood of the Moslem, and the Moslem heaved a comprehending sigh,\r\nexpressed his gratitude, and took his departure.\r\n\r\nNext day all Uskub knew that it was mad, and Moslem and Christian alike\r\nbowed low in holy reverence as it passed.\r\n\r\n‘Well,’ said my countrywoman, after she had shaken hands with Russians,\r\nJews, Austrians, and English, coming last to me, ‘you can bet your\r\nsweet life I ain’t sorry I hit on somebody in this benighted land who\r\ncan speak plain United States.’\r\n\r\nUskub is ordinarily a quiet and sober town, and well might it be; it\r\nis nestled in a valley of death. Tombstones are always the prominent\r\nfeature of a Turkish town, but Uskub resembles an oasis in a desert\r\nof dead. Acres of them in general disorder, a few erect but mostly\r\ntoppling or fallen, surround the town and stretch long arms into it;\r\nthey flank the main road and dot the side streets, and far out into\r\nthe country lone deserted stones stand where no man’s hand has been\r\nfor ages. The sight is gruesome, and one’s mind is wont to picture the\r\nmany massacres that have made this sea of silent slabs. But a large\r\nproportion of the graves are those of Mohamedans, and history records\r\nno general slaughter of them since the battle of Kossovo, more than\r\nfour centuries agone. This is the explanation--Christians plant bones\r\non top of bones, but the six feet of earth allotted to the dead Turk\r\ngenerally remains his until Judgment Day. In many Turkish towns you\r\nwill find streets turned out of their natural course to leave the grave\r\nof a Turk undisturbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAVES OF DEAD COMMITTAJIS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD TURKISH SEXTON WHO LIVED IN A GRAVE.]\r\n\r\nThe old sexton of a cemetery in Uskub, who lives in a cave burrowed\r\nunder the ground like the abodes of those he watches, was in a terrible\r\ndilemma after the American adventuress had snapped his photograph,\r\nbecause she, a giaour, tramped back to the road over the resting-place\r\nof believers.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the Hôtel Turati is a Turkish cemetery, and not\r\nfar behind it is a Christian burial-ground; and almost daily a\r\nfuneral procession passes the hotel to one or the other of these\r\nburial-grounds. The body of a Turk is borne on a litter on the\r\nshoulders of his friends, each of them taking a turn for a few minutes\r\nas pall-bearer. If the deceased was very popular, and the distance from\r\nhis home to the grave very short, there is a continual commotion about\r\nthe corpse, friends giving place rapidly to one another as the body is\r\nborne along.\r\n\r\nThe Christians do not carry their dead on their shoulders, but they,\r\nalso, convey the corpse on a litter to lower it into a wooden coffin\r\nin the grave. Priests precede the funeral parade on foot in full\r\nvestments, chanting as they march, and the friends follow the body, one\r\ncarrying the coffin-lid.\r\n\r\nA strange sacrifice for the dead takes place quarterly in the Christian\r\ncemetery. The peasants gather from far and near bringing cakes and pans\r\nof boiled wheat, of the best they can afford, and place them on the\r\ngraves of the dead. Candles are stuck about the food and tinsel paper\r\ncut in fine shreds arranged over it. Priests pass from grave to grave\r\npraying with the peasants for the souls of the departed, and sons of\r\nthe priests, who serve as acolytes, swing censers. At the conclusion\r\nof the ceremony the sacrificial food is distributed to the poor--or\r\nrather the poorer--and lazy gypsies gather with many naked babies at\r\nthe borders of the cemetery.\r\n\r\nLeaving the ceremony the foreigner is beset by these beggars,\r\nespecially the naked urchins. They follow one to the gate of the hotel.\r\nOne brat is too large to go unclad, according to the requirements of\r\ndecency regarded by the Turks, so his mother’s apron is tied around\r\nhis waist. But he hopes to elicit a piastre by cutting capers, one of\r\nwhich is a somersault. As his arms and head go down the single garment\r\ndrops over them, and the high half of his anatomy is exposed like the\r\ndouble-headed dolls in the Strand. But we give them nothing. We have\r\nseen these fellows count their day’s collection, and knowing the day’s\r\nwages of a field labourer in Turkey to be infinitely less, we give to\r\nthe latter. The Tzigane maims a brat, and by its begging the family\r\nis supported. And it is the fool Christian who gives; it is a part of\r\nhis religion to pay by ‘charity’ the way of deceased souls through the\r\ngolden gates.\r\n\r\nA round and ragged brown urchin who blacks boots before the hotel and\r\nswallows the money he receives, bettered his position one day through\r\nthe favour his funny face had found with the foreigners at the hotel.\r\nOn calling for the bootblack one morning he appeared leading a blind\r\nbeggar. But nobody patronised him now, and the two departed jabbering\r\nviciously. Next morning the brat was back again with his blacking-box,\r\nshining boots and swallowing small coins.\r\n\r\nThere is a Tzigane quarter in every large town in Turkey, and it\r\ngenerally stands somewhere near the circle of graveyards. It is\r\nalways the most squalid quarter, holes in old walls, shanties made of\r\nflattened petroleum tins, caves in hillsides, serving the gypsies as\r\nabodes. They are a filthy people, and a burden to the community. They\r\nseldom till the soil, object to work, and live for the most part by\r\nbegging or stealing. They stand alone in the world as a people without\r\na religion, and their primitive instincts lead them to follow the\r\nnatural bent of man to prey upon others. They came into Europe on the\r\nheels of the Turk, and remained in some of the countries from which\r\nhe has been compelled to recede. In one of the Balkan States they are\r\nexempt from military service, as they cannot be held to routine; in\r\nthe others they are generally assigned to duty in the bands because of\r\ntheir talent for music.\r\n\r\nAcross the old stone bridge, on the road that leads up to the citadel,\r\nare many curious booths. A questionable character of doubtful race sits\r\nTurkish fashion in one the size of a draper’s box, before him a pot of\r\nwriting fluid, several wooden pens, some slips of common paper, and a\r\npepper-box of sand, also a constant cup of coffee, a tobacco-box, and\r\na flint. Natives pass up this hill to the market place behind the old\r\nfort, and on market days the man of letters is very busy. Christians\r\ndo not patronise his talents, for in every Christian community, thanks\r\nto the propagandas, there are several peasants who can read and write;\r\nbut Mohamedans, faithful to the wishes of the Padisha, abstain from the\r\ncorruption of education, and thereby make the letter-writer necessary.\r\n\r\nA veiled lady presents a letter at the booth.\r\n\r\n‘From whom?’ asks the sage of cipher.\r\n\r\n‘Our husband,’ the veiled lady replies.\r\n\r\n‘“Most beloved of my wives,”’ the flattering fellow begins to read, ‘“I\r\nam well. I wish you are well. The weather is well. The buffaloes are\r\nwell....”’ Here the wise man studies the document closely, and asks:\r\n‘What is your husband’s name?’\r\n\r\n‘Almoon, effendi.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, yes; Almoon.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HORSE MARKET.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWEARING TO A BARGAIN.]\r\n\r\nThe woman pays two metaleeks.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later the same woman appears with another letter.\r\n\r\n‘From whom is it?’ again the question.\r\n\r\n‘Our husband,’ again the reply.\r\n\r\n‘“Most beloved wife,”’ by way of variation, ‘“the weather is well. I am\r\nwell. I wish you well.” What did you say your husband’s name is?’\r\n\r\n‘Almoon.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, yes; Almoon. Your husband’s writer does not form his letters well.’\r\n\r\nThe woman pays two more metaleeks.\r\n\r\nSome time later she returns again. The intelligent man of letters\r\nrecognises her this time, and employs his trained memory.\r\n\r\n‘“Most beloved of my wives,”’ he begins, ‘“I hope you are well. I\r\nam----”’\r\n\r\n‘Effendi,’ the woman interrupts, ‘this letter, I think, is from my\r\nsister.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, you should have told me!’\r\n\r\nAnother hole in the wall, the keeper clinking coin--no doubt as to his\r\nrace, he deals in money. He charges a piastre (twopence) for changing a\r\nlira, but silver coins are bought by him at current value. In Turkey a\r\ngold piece seems to have no fixed value; but actually it is the price\r\nof silver that varies. In Constantinople a pound Turkish is worth 103\r\npiastres, in Salonica only 101, but in Uskub it brings 105, and in\r\nMonastir 107 or 108. Obviously the thing to do is to buy silver coin\r\nin Monastir and sell it in Salonica. Imagine getting twenty-three\r\nshillings in change for a pound in Liverpool, twenty-two in Manchester,\r\nand twenty in London!\r\n\r\nOver the opening of a larger booth bunches of blood-coloured skull-caps\r\nhang by long black or blue tassels a foot or more in length, resembling\r\nat no great distance the scalps and scalp-locks of Red Indians. White\r\nAlbanian caps and Turkish fezzes are also on sale, and a row of heavy\r\nbrass blocks, like closed mouth of cannon, line the front of this\r\nformidable-looking shop. These last are presses for fezzes, which are\r\nput in shape for two metaleeks.\r\n\r\nLemonade booths, faced with rows of huge bottles containing green,\r\nred, and yellow drinks--limes, blood oranges, and lemons corking the\r\nrespective bottles--and other permanent shops line the hill road and\r\nflank the covered bazaars. But the real fair is held only once a week\r\non the open space above, where the Turkish garrison performs its silent\r\ntarget practice.\r\n\r\nTuesday is the market day in Uskub, and the scene behind the ancient\r\nfortress above the Vardar, in view of the surrounding country for\r\nmany miles, is alone worth going to Turkey to see. The vast hilltop\r\nis littered with native goods for sale or exchange, and crowded with\r\nmen and women in gay and gruesome garbs. Albanian shepherds and their\r\nlean dogs mind flocks of fat-tailed sheep, their spectral wives,\r\nin faded ghost gowns, sit selling hand-worked waistcoats of gaudy\r\nhue; Christian peasants who have come afoot or on asses or driving\r\nprimitive ox-carts, display all sorts of country commodities, from new\r\ngrain to ice (in the summer time) from the white peaks in the distance;\r\nTurks have a little rough lumber (there is not much in Macedonia); and\r\nTurkish soldiers, among the most ragged men in the concourse, dispose\r\nof horses, old boots, hunks of bread, gathered--who knows how? Tziganes\r\nare always on the horse market. A photograph shows a bargain being\r\nmade, a third man, a Turk, swearing a Bulgarian and a gypsy to an\r\nexchange of cows.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur defeat at Istip had not been forgotten. Since then we had awaited\r\nonly a reasonable excuse for taking a reasonable risk. One of the\r\nAustrians came in with the account of a combat between a Servian band\r\nand a Turkish regiment, which had taken place two days before at a\r\nspot in the mountains above a hamlet named Pschtinia, several hours’\r\nride towards the Bulgarian border. This was justification for breaking\r\nthe Turks’ cordon about us. Our papers had sent us many miles at heavy\r\nexpense, and we must have exclusive news. Better reading, to be sure,\r\nis the cool, considered report of reports written at headquarters,\r\nbut the true correspondent always prefers to date his stuff at the\r\nfiring-line.\r\n\r\nTo assure ourselves that we were taking no unnecessary risk, that there\r\nwas no chance of securing permission to seek the scene of this fight,\r\nwe called on the Governor-General, who had duped and deceived us many\r\ntimes--no doubt to his quiet satisfaction, though he was always too\r\nmuch of a gentleman to display delight in our dilemma.\r\n\r\n‘Ah,’ said Hussein Hilmi Pasha, as we sipped his coffee, ‘you went to\r\nIstip, and were prevented from visiting Garbintzi. I sent orders to\r\nturn you back. As I have often told you, effendi, it is dangerous in\r\nthe interior; one cannot say where a “brigand”’--his excellency meant\r\na Bulgarian insurgent--‘may be lurking to shoot the European. I have\r\nletters from the chiefs threatening to kill a consul. As you know, they\r\nhope to make trouble for us with the Powers.’\r\n\r\n‘But, excellency, you may give us an escort.’\r\n\r\n‘Even with escort one is unsafe. They can fire at you from a mountain\r\nside high up above. They are fiends, these brigands; they do not care\r\nif they are killed themselves.’\r\n\r\n‘But we were permitted to cross a most lawless section of the country,\r\nand were stopped only when we sought to visit the scene of a fight.\r\nSurely, your excellency, this is a mistaken policy on your part; we\r\nmust gather that there is something to hide from correspondents.’ We\r\nhad put down this argument before.\r\n\r\n‘There is nothing to hide. Come to me, and I shall tell you the truth\r\nabout all affairs. But I can permit no more travelling in the interior.’\r\n\r\nThe same old story. We left the pasha’s presence pretending\r\ndisappointment. But his threat of Bulgarian ‘brigands’ did not disturb\r\nus, and we were willing to take the chance of encountering Albanians.\r\nWe were going to Pschtinia. The game was not difficult; it required\r\nsimply coolness and courage and a knowledge of the ways of the Turk.\r\nThe Englishman possessed sufficient of the first two requisites, and I\r\nhad dealt with the Ottoman authorities for more than a year.\r\n\r\nLate that evening we sent our dragoman for a Turkish coachman, and\r\nhired him to be on hand the following morning at nine o’clock, Turkish\r\ntime, to take us to Kalkandele, an Albanian town about the same\r\ndistance off as is Pschtinia, but in the opposite direction. We knew\r\nthe native coachman’s ways.\r\n\r\nA jingle of many bells announced the arrival of our carriage next\r\nmorning at ten o’clock Turkish (about 5.30), the hour at which we\r\nplanned to leave. The bells were for the purpose of warning other\r\nvehicles coming the opposite way along steep roads, but they would also\r\nhave the effect of disturbing sleeping guardhouses and apprising them\r\nof the fact that we were bound on a country journey. The danger of\r\ncollision was the minor risk, and we ordered the driver to relieve his\r\nponies of their noisy necklaces. The Turk protested, and commenced to\r\ndiscuss the matter, but there was no time for argument. Having got the\r\nbells safe under a seat, we told him to drive to Pschtinia.\r\n\r\n‘You hired me to go to Kalkandele.’\r\n\r\n‘We have changed our minds.’\r\n\r\n‘But I have told the police you were going to Kalkandele.’\r\n\r\nExactly; and without doubt the first guardhouse on the road to the west\r\nhad instructions to turn us back.\r\n\r\nOur Turk soon learned that we were no meek and native Christians, and\r\nrather than lose his job altogether he obeyed our commands. We drove\r\nquietly through the deserted streets, the ponies’ hoofs pattering\r\nsoftly in the thick cushion of dust, the lucky beads on their harness\r\nrattling, one wheel of our shandrydan maintaining a rhythmic creak--but\r\nno one speaking. Drowsy patrols who had fallen asleep by the wayside\r\nlooked up from the corners as we drove by, but our Turk on the box\r\nserved us as a passport. Even the guardhouse at the far side of the\r\nVardar was content to let us pass at this sleepy hour, seeing that our\r\nteam was not equipped with country bells. We passed under the barracks\r\nobserved only by the sentinel on the crest of the cliff, who blinked\r\nhis heavy eyes and stared stupidly down like a waking owl, his head\r\nswinging a mechanical half-circle as we came into view and passed out\r\nagain. A mile and a half through a million gravestones, stretching\r\nfrom the crooked roadway on either side across the sweep of a broad\r\nplateau--this was nerve-racking. We were in full view from the citadel,\r\nthe barracks, the Konak, and several minarets--a black beetle crawling\r\nalong a crooked chalk line drawn through a never-weeded prairie of\r\nwhite stone stalks and sheaves. We urged the driver to lay on the lash\r\nand crawl quicker, and we took turns in casting sly glances behind.\r\nBut the end of this drear graveyard came at last. We switched sharply\r\non a waggon trail to the left, and plunged into the hills, in a stroke\r\nclipping dreamy Uskub from the scene. We breathed freer; we were fairly\r\nstarted on our journey long before the guardhouse on the road to\r\nKalkandele had given us up and reported our failure to pass their way.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time our driver became unruly, slowing his pace and\r\nrefusing to use his whip, protesting that his horses would not last\r\nto Pschtinia at the rate at which we were going. We promised to let\r\nhim give them a long rest at our destination, to drive back to Uskub\r\nat his own pace, and to raise his fee a mijidieh, all of which, with\r\noccasional promptings, kept the horses to their fugitive gait. Our\r\nrattle-trap dashed through the cornfields, terrified the peasants in\r\ntheir harvesting, drew the shepherds’ dogs, and scattered grazing\r\nsheep, rolled down the mountain sides, making desperate swerves, and\r\nclimbed up empty, assisted by its passengers. We passed Albanians and\r\nBulgarians, who may have been brigands and insurgents, and questions\r\nwere asked our driver, but he was out of temper and did not stop\r\nto reply. We made Pschtinia at eleven--the wonder, only a trace\r\nbroke!--the Turk in a rage, and the sweat pouring from his panting\r\nsteeds.\r\n\r\nWe chuckled at the expense of Hilmi Pasha, and drew visions of\r\nhis wrath; he would permit us to see no more of the interior for\r\nourselves. We grew bold here and planned to march on foot across\r\nMacedonia, from Uskub east to Djuma-bala, and from there on the\r\nBulgarian border to Drama near the sea, a distance, all told, of three\r\nhundred miles, and you shall see whether we carried out this resolution.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Pschtinia, many bandaged and limping, gathered\r\nround us and kissed our hands, thinking we were foreign Consuls come\r\nto inquire into their grievances. After the fight the Turks had passed\r\nthrough Pschtinia on their way back to barracks at Koumanova, stopped\r\nand beaten the peasants for having harboured the insurgents (which they\r\nprotested they had not), and carried off the headmen to prison at the\r\ntown. The old men insisted on showing us the welts on their backs and\r\nbruises on their legs, inflicted by the Turks with heavy sticks, and\r\nsaid that the villagers worst mauled had been taken to Koumanova to the\r\ndoctor, and were now in the gaol there.\r\n\r\nWhen we had eaten of the eggs and brown bread, and drunk of milk\r\nprovided by different villagers, we climbed to the battlefield with two\r\nguides who had escaped mauling. It was a forlorn place for a last stand\r\nagainst overwhelming odds--a vast gravel dome, barren but for dwarfed\r\nyellow shrubs, and out of sight of every human habitation, even the\r\nvillage it sheltered. The band had been discovered some distance to the\r\nnorth, and chased by an ever-increasing pack of pursuers until driven\r\nto bay at this high peak. The insurgents attempted evidently to reach\r\na forest on a neighbouring height, but the Turks cut them off before\r\nthey could reach it. Little piles of stone a foot high, showing the\r\nhaste with which they had been thrown together, were still standing,\r\nbehind each a dark brown spot, a bloody rag or two, a scattering of\r\nempty Mauser cartridge-cases. On the slope of the dome we picked up\r\nMartini cases. ‘Turk,’ said the peasants. That was evident. The calibre\r\nwas stamped in Turkish characters. Holes in the pink earth, with bits\r\nof cast iron firmly embedded in the rock, marked the places where the\r\ndynamite bombs had struck at the last charge, when the soldiers stormed\r\nthe crest and the end of the insurgents was a matter of seconds.\r\n\r\nSome time after the soldiers had withdrawn, and the dome was desolate\r\nagain, a few peasants ventured to the top. They found the bodies of\r\ntwenty-four Servians, battered and disfigured, and completely stripped;\r\nthe Turks had taken away their own dead. Not so much of value as an old\r\nshoe remained on the battlefield. The next day the strong outfits of\r\nthe insurgents, which had come from Belgrade, were sold by the soldiers\r\non the market place at Koumanova. The peasants of Pschtinia rolled the\r\nbodies in coarse striped buffalo blankets, carried them down to the\r\nvillage, and buried them in the cemetery, the village priest performing\r\nthe burial service. A rough wooden cross was raised over each grave.\r\nThe villagers said the soldiers came back to Pschtinia and tore the\r\ncrosses down; but they reared them again when the Turks were gone.\r\n\r\n‘Are you Servians?’ we asked the peasants.\r\n\r\n‘Bulgarians, effendi.’\r\n\r\n‘Then this band was an enemy to your party?’\r\n\r\n‘But they were Christians.’\r\n\r\nOn descending to the village we found our Turk already harnessing his\r\nteam. He had been fed, and so had his horses, and they were all in a\r\nmore tractable mood. The villagers, hale and halt, gathered around our\r\ncarriage as we prepared to start, and poured forth their blessings on\r\nour Christian heads. Several small boys brought us dirty little fried\r\nfish, about two inches long, as a parting gift. We took the fish,\r\nrewarding the young villagers, and, as we crossed the stream, deposited\r\nthe smoky carcases whence they had been drawn wriggling an hour before.\r\n\r\nOur driver took us home by a different route, more direct, he said,\r\nwith a great ‘something’ to see. He had noted that the Englishman\r\ngave backsheesh, and was wont to put us in his countrymen’s way. He\r\nhimself belonged to the world-fraternity of cab-men, whose instincts\r\nvary nowhere, East or West; but his cousin, to whom he took us, was a\r\nTurkish peasant, a man who, when the spirit of war is without his soul,\r\nis as true a gentleman as Occident or Orient produces.\r\n\r\nIn crossing a trackless moor to the road that led where our Turk would\r\ntake us, we lost the road, and for an hour wandered aimlessly till\r\nwe met an armed man with a woman who covered her face at sight of\r\nus. The armed man asked the usual questions of our Turk, and gave him\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nIt was five o’clock when we arrived at a great wall of mud bricks,\r\ninfinitely higher and better built than those surrounding the average\r\nMacedonian dwelling, but dilapidated and showing long want of care.\r\nThe walls enclosed a vast irregular area, and entirely obscured the\r\nview within. We drove round wondering and asking questions of our\r\nTurk, which he ignored with a smile. Finally, we approached a high\r\ngate designed after the fashion of that leading to the Sublime Porte.\r\nOur driver stood up on the box and began a hallooing, which burst like\r\ntrumpet blasts on the still surroundings. It was some time before\r\na far-off answer came over the walls. The call and the reply were\r\ncontinued, the latter drawing gradually nearer, and after some minutes\r\na man spoke through a keyhole not less than five inches high. Our Turk\r\ndescended from the carriage-box, was recognised by him within, and told\r\nto wait until the key was fetched. We then peered through the keyhole,\r\nand after a brief interval spied the inmate returning from the house\r\ntoiling under the weight of an iron key of robust diameter and a foot\r\nand a half long.\r\n\r\nThe huge oak gate was swung back, and we entered, greeted with a\r\ndignified salaam and a shake of the hand. There are no social classes\r\namong the Turks across which the hand-shake is debarred. Deference is\r\nshown superiors only in the salaam, a pasha receiving a lower bow with\r\nan extra twist of the hand than that given a bey, and a bey a lower dip\r\nof hand and head than a bimbashee, a bimbashee than an ordinary mortal\r\neffendi.\r\n\r\nThe Turk who welcomed us was the keeper, and, with his wife, the only\r\noccupant of this vast estate, the empty home of an exiled bey. The\r\nhouse was shown to us by both the keeper and his wife, who, though,\r\nof course, a Mohamedan woman, wore no veil. The house was handsome\r\nfor this part of the country, but depleted even of furniture. The\r\nonly pictures on the walls were common paintings on the plaster now\r\ncracked and falling. The harem, where marble divans for five wives were\r\nbuilt in nooks, was filled with newly harvested grain. A bold rooster,\r\nthe only lord of the manor, cackled to half a dozen happy hens and\r\nscattered the corn. We helped the keeper eject the usurper and his\r\nfeminine following.\r\n\r\nA bridge, resembling the Bridge of Sighs, led out of the harem into the\r\ndwelling of the exiled lord, bare like the other house. We climbed the\r\ncreaky, dust-covered stairs to a turret at the point of the roof, which\r\noverlooked the surrounding walls and afforded a view of the encircling\r\nmountains. A brilliant southern sun was setting in an Oriental sky, and\r\na train of three buffalo teams, silhouetted in the glow, crept along\r\nthe sky-line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALBANIAN WOMEN.]\r\n\r\nLate in the evening we passed through the long cemetery and entered\r\nUskub. Lights were out for the night, and patrols paced the streets.\r\nWe were halted several times, but our driver’s Turkish rang true, and\r\nwe proceeded to the gates of Hôtel Turati, where, after much knocking,\r\nNicola roused from his slumbers and removed the bars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nMETROVITZA AND THE ALBANIANS\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Listen, my brothers! You must be ready for the Holy War. When you\r\nhear for the second time the voice of public crier Mecho, gather great\r\nand small, of all ages between seven and seventy, and range yourselves\r\nunder the banners. Those who have blood debts have nothing to fear. God\r\nand the country pardon them. The Seven Kings[4] are banded together,\r\nbut we do not fear them, nor would they frighten us if they were\r\nseventy, or as many more.’\r\n\r\nThe clans agreed upon a _bessa_, or truce, blood feuds were declared\r\noff for the time, and the Albanians of Jakova, Ipek, and other\r\ndistricts neighbouring Metrovitza banded together, great and small, of\r\nall ages, to combat the reforms imposed upon the Sultan by the Powers.\r\n\r\nThe feature of the reforms which gave them most offence was the mixed\r\ngendarmerie. The British Consul at Uskub had suggested that it would be\r\nsheer slaughter to create Christian police among the Albanians. But the\r\narrogant Russian, who at that time played first fiddle in the _opéra\r\ncomique_, opposed this view, probably for no other reason than that it\r\nwas English; and the Turks, who make game of mad methods, agreed to the\r\nAustro-Russian demands with alacrity, and sent six Servian gendarmes to\r\nVutchitrin.\r\n\r\nThe public crier made his second call. Albanians to the number of\r\nseveral thousand foregathered and visited Vutchitrin. But arriving\r\nthere they found the Turkish kaimakam had sent the sorry Serbs away to\r\na secret place of safety.\r\n\r\nThis was not a dire disappointment for the Albanians; they projected\r\nbigger sport for the following day and kept the peace during the\r\nnight. Early next morning they set forth for Metrovitza, a short\r\nmarch, to fulfil a promise, made a year before, to destroy the newly\r\nestablished Russian Consulate. But, over-confident and swaggering with\r\npride, they boasted openly of what they would do, and when they came\r\nto the Consular town they found the roads blocked with infantry and\r\ncovered by cannon. The Albanians halted, and the chiefs went forward\r\nto parley with the Turkish commander: they were faithful followers of\r\nthe Padisha, doing only what he would desire. But the Turk could not be\r\nmoved, and threatened to fire if the Albanians advanced.\r\n\r\nThe Albanians did not believe that the Sultan’s soldiers would fire on\r\nthe faithful, and when the whole force had gathered they marched boldly\r\nupon the town by two roads at the same time. They were met by a volley\r\nfrom the troops, and, much cut up, retired. A body of them occupied\r\nan old mill across a little stream which bordered the barracks, and\r\nfired upon the garrison from there until shelled out. Then the whole\r\nnumber, after collecting their dead--with the tacit permission of the\r\nTurks--withdrew to their own towns. But the Russian Consul was not to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nThe garrison of Metrovitza, which was largely Albanian, sympathised\r\nthoroughly with the Albanian effort that had failed, and, indeed, every\r\nMohamedan did. The Government had got more than it bargained for. The\r\ngarrison was sore and sullen, and when the soldiers gathered at the\r\ncafés in the evening, it was to deplore the day’s work and to speculate\r\nupon the Padisha’s will.\r\n\r\nAt one café a fanatic dervish, after working his hearers to frenzied\r\npitch, exclaimed, ‘And is there not a single Mohamedan who will rid us\r\nof this giaour?’\r\n\r\n‘I will,’ said a piping little voice.\r\n\r\n‘You! Oh, no, you will not!’ said the dervish scornfully.\r\n\r\n‘I will,’ repeated the other.\r\n\r\nHe was a soldier who had been in the fight, a slim, sickly fellow with\r\na sad visage. I saw him on trial at Uskub.\r\n\r\nThe next morning M. Stcherbina, attired in Russian uniform, followed\r\nby a Cossack, two heavily armed kavasses, and a troop of soldiers,\r\nofficers, and officials--the Turks doing honour and service against\r\ntheir convictions--went out to inspect the line of battle, the plan\r\nof which, it was alleged, the Russian had directed. As the Consul in\r\ngreat state passed, the sentinels presented arms--which the Russians\r\nexact of the Turks. One Mohamedan, required thus to degrade himself,\r\nlowered his gun quickly as the Consul passed before him at a distance\r\nof three paces, and without waiting to aim, fired a fatal ball into the\r\n‘infidel’s’ body. Then, flinging away his gun, the soldier started at a\r\nmad pace down the slope, over the rocks toward the mountains of Albania.\r\n\r\nThe Consul’s retinue, surprised for a moment, were soon after the\r\nfugitive, firing fast; but he travelled a hundred yards before they\r\nwounded him. The Cossack claimed, and no doubt fired, the telling shot.\r\n\r\nAt his first trial the murderer was condemned to prison for a term\r\nof fifteen years. Strange to say, Abdul Hamid is averse from capital\r\npunishment. But the Russians were not satisfied with this sentence\r\nand demanded a new trial; and at the second hearing, at Uskub (a mock\r\naffair with the verdict pre-determined) the soldier was condemned to\r\ndeath. Before he was executed the White Czar pardoned the murderer of\r\nM. Stcherbina! But a few months later, not only the murderer of M.\r\nRoskowsky, Russian Consul at Monastir, but also a soldier who stood by\r\nand saw the deed done, and made no attempt to prevent it, were hanged\r\nat Russian command.\r\n\r\nThe ways of the Turk and the ways of the Russian are wonderful and\r\nsimilar.\r\n\r\nThe display of the Russian dead was truly Russian. The body of M.\r\nStcherbina was placed on a bier in a goods car, lined and completely\r\ncovered with mourning, on each side and each end an immense white\r\ncross. This moving catafalque was dragged from Metrovitza to Salonica,\r\nmet along the route by Servian and Bulgarian clergy and such Consuls\r\nas would participate in the demonstration, and opened for services at\r\nthe chief stations. At Salonica the body was laid in state in a new\r\nBulgarian church, from which there was a great parade to a Russian\r\nman-of-war, Consuls all participating, Turkish soldiers and officials\r\ndoing honour.\r\n\r\nThe object of these proceedings seemed to be to impress Turks,\r\nChristians, and Jews alike with the power of Russia. Alas! for the\r\npower of Russia, the Japanese war soon followed, and its result\r\ndelighted Turks and Jews and many Christians.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Constantinople came a commission of holy men with gifts from\r\nthe Sultan and arguments from the Koran to conciliate the injured\r\nAlbanians. But they would not be reconciled. Abdul Hamid had kept them\r\narmed for generations for his own purposes, had chosen his bodyguard\r\nfrom among them because of their faithfulness, and now no amount of\r\nbacksheesh, or multiloquence about their transgressing the will of God,\r\nwould bring them to terms. They were going to fight. So the Albanian\r\nsoldiers were brought out of the Albanian districts and replaced by\r\npurely Turkish regiments. More Anatolians were brought over from Asia\r\nMinor in vast numbers, and mobilised at Verisovitch.\r\n\r\nThose who knew the Turkish Government doubted that actual\r\nhostilities against the Albanians would take place. But Russia was\r\npressing--threatening a naval demonstration with the Black Sea\r\nfleet--and the Sultan fought his faithful friends.\r\n\r\nTwo small encounters took place. Of course the Albanians, badly armed\r\nand without organisation, were easily defeated. The chiefs were made\r\nprisoners and taken to Constantinople, where they were decorated,\r\nprobably pensioned for life, and made altogether better off than they\r\nhad been hitherto.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that the Sultan ‘fixed’ his Albanian bodyguard before he\r\nsent an army against their brothers, for had not his own safety been\r\nsecured, it can be taken he would have preferred war with the ‘Seven\r\nKings.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMetrovitza, being on the railway, was accessible without the permission\r\nof Hilmi Pasha, and an Englishman, a Dane, and I went up to see the\r\nbattle ground. We were invited to visit the Russian Consulate, and\r\nfound a Russian kavass awaiting us with a bodyguard of soldiers.\r\n\r\nIt was not a far walk from the station to the Consulate, which we\r\nrecognised from a distance by the tremendous tricolour that floated\r\nfrom the balcony, drooping to within six feet of the road beneath. The\r\nConsulate was situated between the barracks and a camp of Turkish\r\nsoldiers, and on several sides, immediately about the house, were small\r\ndetachments of picked troops.\r\n\r\nFirst to greet us as we entered the door was the Cossack, in bushy\r\nbusby, blue dress with large white spots, brown sleeves, leggings, and\r\nmany weapons. He was a moth-like creature, hair, beard, and skin the\r\nsame sickly pallor, and eyes of a dull blue. The kavasses--generally\r\nswaggering--looked sheepish; they were Albanians--traitors, in their\r\ncountrymen’s eyes. But the Consul, M. Mashkov, late of Uskub, was full\r\nof fire, actually pugnacious, and, so he told us, ready to die in his\r\ncountry’s service.\r\n\r\nA telegram arrived a few minutes after we did, containing a warning\r\nthat the Sublime Porte had received a letter from the Bulgarian\r\ncommittajis, informing the Turkish Government of their intention to\r\nassassinate another Russian consul. The object of this telegram--the\r\norigin of which is obvious--I am at a loss to understand, but such\r\nwarnings to consuls come constantly from the Turkish Government.\r\n\r\n‘They have killed M. Stcherbina,’ said M. Mashkov; ‘they may kill me;\r\nbut they cannot kill the Russian Consul!’\r\n\r\nThe Dane asked the Consul if he really thought he would be\r\nassassinated, and M. Mashkov replied, ‘I expect to leave Turkey as M.\r\nStcherbina did. If the Albanians do not kill me, the Bulgarians will.’\r\n\r\nBut I am glad to record that our entertaining and generous host--whose\r\nideas and sympathies, I regret, do not agree with mine--was soon\r\ntransferred to Egypt, and got away from Turkey alive.\r\n\r\nWe tramped over the battlefield in the same manner that the dead\r\nRussian had done, with Russian kavasses and Turkish soldiers for our\r\nprotection, and a Turkish officer who spoke French as a conductor. We\r\nresembled a Russian commission, and the sentinels rose from the ground\r\nand saluted. Every time we passed one the sins of my life all came back\r\nto my mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlbania is the most romantic country in Europe, probably in all the\r\nworld. It is a lawless land where might makes right, and parts of it\r\nare as forbidding to the foreigner as darkest Africa. In the country\r\naround Ipek, Jakova, and Prisrend, and even Kalkandele, the homes of\r\nmen are strongholds built of stone, with no windows on the ground\r\nfloors, and those above mere loopholes. At the corners of a village or\r\nestate are _kulers_, towers of defence, from which the enemy can be\r\nseen far down the road.\r\n\r\nThe first law of the land is the law of the gun, as it was in the Wild\r\nWest. But the country is more thickly populated than was the American\r\nborder in the old days, and men have banded together in clans for\r\noffensive and defensive purposes.\r\n\r\nThere is no education in Albania--the Turks have kept the country\r\nilliterate--and promises have come to be bonds. It is because the\r\nAlbanians keep their word that Abdul Hamid has chosen them as his\r\nbodyguard. But the Albanian has no regard for the man he has not sworn\r\nto, and, though the petty thief is despised, it is considered brave\r\nwork to kill a man for his money.\r\n\r\nAlbanian customs are dangerous to break, and are handed down the\r\ngenerations unwritten as sacredly as are feuds. Some strange customs\r\nexist. To compliment an unmarried woman, for instance, is provocation\r\nfor death. A blood enemy is under amnesty while in the company of a\r\nwoman. A woman may shoot a fiancé who breaks his betrothal or call\r\nupon the young man’s father to kill him. If a man commits murder, and,\r\nflying for his life, enters the house of another, friend or foe, he\r\nis safe. This is the case, even if he takes refuge in the house of a\r\nbrother of the man he has slain. He may not remain there for ever; but\r\nfor three days he can live on the best the house provides. When that\r\ntime is up, he is shown on his way. Twenty-four hours is given him to\r\nmake his escape; after that the _bessa_ is over and the blood feud\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\nIn their national dress the Albanians of the North are always\r\ndistinguishable. The men wear baggy trousers, usually white, tight\r\nfitting to the ankle. Down each side of them and over the back is a\r\nbroad band of rich black silk cording. Very often a design in rich red\r\ntapers down each leg to the knee. A broad sash (over a leather belt),\r\nbetween trousers and shirt, serves as holster for pistol and yataghan.\r\nA short, richly worked waistcoat reaches down to the top of the\r\nsash, but misses meeting across the chest by six inches. The costumes\r\ndiffer considerably in various parts of Albania. In Southern Albania\r\nthe men wear pleated ballet skirts like the Northern Greeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ALBANIAN AND HIS KULER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALBANIAN.]\r\n\r\nFor headgear the Albanian generally wears a tiny, tight-fitting white\r\nskull-cap which looks in the sun like a bald spot. Some wear caps of\r\nOttoman red, from which a rich, full, flowing silk tassel of black or\r\ndark blue falls to the shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe cut of the hair is peculiar. The men of one section will have\r\ntheir heads closely shaven, except in one circular space about an\r\ninch across. The single tuft curls down underneath the cap like a Red\r\nIndian’s scalp-lock. Others will shave the top of the head where the\r\ncap rests. There is reason in this; as the Mohamedan seldom removes his\r\nfez, the heat over the head is thereby equalised. There are a dozen\r\nother cuts, none of which beautify the Albanian; nevertheless, he is\r\nalways of striking appearance.\r\n\r\nThe Albanians are of pure European origin. They are tall,\r\nbroad-shouldered men, with fine faces. They are quite unlike any of\r\nthe other people of Macedonia, even speaking a totally different\r\nlanguage. While nothing definite is known of their origin, it is more\r\nthan probable that they are the descendants of the ancient Illyrians,\r\nwho once occupied all the western side of the Balkan Peninsula, and\r\nwere gradually driven to the mountains of Albania by the successive\r\ninvasions of Greeks, Romans, Slavs, and Turks.\r\n\r\nAlbania has never been wholly subdued or civilised. It was partially\r\nconquered by Servian princes in the Middle Ages, and under them\r\nattained a certain civilisation; but at the Turkish conquest it\r\nrelapsed into a wild state.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Albanians have become Mohamedans, chiefly\r\nbecause the religion carried with it the right to bear arms and\r\nother privileges. In ‘Turkey in Europe,’[5] there is an account of a\r\ncharacteristic Albanian conversion. Until about a hundred years ago the\r\ninhabitants of a certain little group of villages in Southern Albania\r\nhad retained their Christianity. Finding themselves unable to repel\r\nthe continual attacks of a neighbouring Moslem population, ‘they met\r\nin a church, solemnly swore that they would fast until Easter, and\r\ninvoked all the saints to work within that period some miracle that\r\nwould better their miserable lot. If this reasonable request were not\r\ngranted, they would all turn Mohamedan. Easter day came, but no signs\r\nfrom saint or angel, and the whole population embraced Islam.’ Soon\r\nafterwards, the change of faith was rewarded; they obtained the arms\r\nwhich they desired, and had the satisfaction of massacring their old\r\nopponents and taking possession of their lands.\r\n\r\nNorthern and Southern Albanians are quite different peoples. The\r\nGhegs and the Tosks they are respectively called. The Tosks are less\r\nturbulent than their Northern brothers. They are ruled by beys, or\r\nhereditary landlords, in a feudal manner. These beys owe an allegiance\r\nto the Sultan. They receive their titles from the Turk, and unless they\r\ndo his bidding to the modest extent he demands, a means of getting rid\r\nof them is found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GROUP OF ALBANIANS.]\r\n\r\nIn the North, however, there is not this handle to whip in proselytes.\r\nA Catholic propaganda is protected by Austria, and, with the exception\r\nof one clan, which is all Catholic, every tribe contains both\r\nMussulmans and Christians. This demonstrates that there is little\r\nfanaticism among them. The clan is stronger than the religious feeling.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult for the Turks to carry out there the custom\r\nof disarming Christians. But the Ottoman Government has secured the\r\nloyalty of Christian as well as Mohamedan Ghegs by allowing them\r\nto pillage and kill their non-Albanian neighbours to their hearts’\r\ncontent. They are ever pressing forward, burning, looting, and\r\nmurdering the Servians of the vilayet of Kossovo. The frontier line of\r\nAlbania has been extended in this way far up into Old Servia. Even the\r\nfrontier of Servia proper is not regarded by these lawless mountain\r\nmen. They often make raids into the neighbouring State, as they have\r\ndone into Bulgaria when quartered as soldiers on that border.\r\n\r\nThe Albanians have overrun all Macedonia. They have found their way in\r\nlarge numbers as far as Constantinople. But beyond their own borders\r\nand the sections of Kossovo from which the Servians have fled,\r\nthey are held within certain bounds. In many Albanian districts the\r\nAlbanians are exempt from military service, but large numbers of them\r\njoin the Turkish army as volunteers. They enlist for the guns and\r\ncartridges.\r\n\r\nThe Albanian looks down on the Turk. You insult an Albanian and\r\ncompliment a Turk if you take either for the other. An Albanian seldom\r\nwears a Turkish fez. Even in the Turkish army the low white skull-cap\r\nis his head-covering.\r\n\r\nSometimes the Albanians show very little regard for their Turkish\r\nofficers. Once at Salonica I saw a company refuse to board a train\r\nbecause some contraband tobacco had been taken from them by the\r\nofficials of the foreign monopoly that exists in Turkey. But the Turk\r\nis different; he is fanatically subordinate. On several occasions I\r\nhave seen Turkish soldiers stand like inanimate things while their\r\nofficers pulled their ears, punched their heads and kicked them.\r\n\r\nIf they thought their Padisha in earnest the Turkish private and\r\npeasant would never resist a measure of reform. But the Albanians have\r\nalways resisted reforms for the reason that reforms would interfere\r\nwith their privileges.\r\n\r\nThe disarming of the Albanians is indispensable to reforms in\r\nMacedonia. The establishment of law courts in Albania was one of Hilmi\r\nPasha’s additions to the Austro-Russian scheme of reforms! If this\r\nreform is ever applied, both parties in a case will go into court with\r\nall their weapons, and the result will be--no matter which way the\r\nverdict goes--the death of the judge.\r\n\r\nOf late years attempts have been made by educated Albanians residing in\r\nBucharest and in Italy to create an agitation for Albanian autonomy;\r\nbut these movements have had no effect as yet on the Albanians; the\r\nTurks are too clever at their control. Should a leader appear among\r\nthem who threatens organisation or civilisation, an emissary of the\r\nSultan arrives with gifts and decorations. If the chief is not venal,\r\nhe is enticed or taken secretly by force to Constantinople, where he\r\nmay be given authority over a district or province which will more than\r\ncompensate him for his loss, but where he can work the empire no harm.\r\n\r\nThere is no free Albanian border state, as with the Greeks, the\r\nBulgarians, and the Serbs, and the Turks are able to prevent the\r\nAlbanians from becoming educated. There are Catholic schools in\r\nNorthern Albania and Orthodox Greek in Southern Albania, but the Turks\r\ndeny the very existence of the Albanian language. The publication of\r\nAlbanian books is prevented and Albanian schools are suppressed. A few\r\nyears ago some of the wealthier inhabitants of a certain town started\r\na school to teach their children their own tongue. One evening the\r\nprofessor disappeared. He was stolen by Turkish soldiers, deported,\r\nand imprisoned. He was held for eight months without trial, and then\r\nas arbitrarily released. He received the usual Turkish shrug of the\r\nshoulders when he asked the reason for the outrage. This was at Cortia,\r\nwhere the Turk’s rule is not merely nominal.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Albanians in Turkey is unique. It is in the power\r\nof the Turks to subdue and govern them; but the Sultans have preferred\r\nto give them licence and to keep the strip of Adriatic land they occupy\r\na lawless barrier against the West. There is no railway across Albania,\r\nthere is only one place along the coast at which ships stop, and the\r\nforeigner is forbidden by both Albanian and Turk. The Turk protests\r\nthat he cannot afford the European safe passport across Albania, and\r\nthe Albanian has been taught to suspect every European as a spy come to\r\nreconnoitre for a foreign Power.\r\n\r\nA few men from civilisation have been to the heart of this romantic\r\ncountry. In order to get there safely it is necessary to acquire the\r\nfriendship and the confidence of the chief of a clan, and to get from\r\nhim a promise of safe passport. Only on one occasion, it is said, did\r\nanyone trusting himself to an Albanian chief lose his life. The man,\r\nwith all his escort, was killed by the members of a hostile clan, and\r\nto this day a blood feud lasts as a result.\r\n\r\nTo take the risk of entering Albania without reason seemed foolhardy,\r\nand as we never had adequate excuse, we left the Balkans without\r\nfulfilling our earnest desire to cross it. We touched the country,\r\nhowever, from the east and from the west, and encountered Albanians\r\neverywhere in Macedonia.\r\n\r\nWe sailed down the Adriatic from Trieste, bound for Greece, the\r\nmountains of Albania often visible, and we touched, among Italian and\r\nother ports, at Hagio Saranda. The place has as many names--Albanian,\r\nTurkish, Slav, Italian, German--as it has houses. The Austrian-Lloyd\r\nsteamer dropped anchor in the bay, and several queer, unwieldy\r\nrow-boats--small barges--came up alongside for a few boxes of Austrian\r\ngoods. The ship lay at anchor an hour, and we went ashore. The same\r\ncringing, unarmed Christians, the same swaggering Albanians, the same\r\nsuspicious officials and ragged soldiers. The Turks bowed politely as\r\nwe landed, and asked questions. We were going down the shore to take a\r\nbath.\r\n\r\n‘This is a small town, effendi; we are sorry there is no bath here.’\r\n\r\nWe were not searching a Turkish bath, and we explained by signs that we\r\nwere going out to swim.\r\n\r\n‘But, effendi, you have not sufficient time.’\r\n\r\nWe knew we had.\r\n\r\nThe argument lasted some time longer, until we broke off rudely,\r\nleaving the officials talking. They did not stop us, but ordered all\r\nthe soldiers to follow and see what our object really was; and they\r\nstood behind bushes and rocks from which they could watch us, and also\r\ncover any insurgents with whom we might have rendezvous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE LONG TRAIL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was excuse for us to cross Macedonia. Twenty-five thousand\r\npeasants from Turkey had taken refuge in Bulgaria, and no correspondent\r\nhad personal knowledge of the state of affairs that caused this\r\nexodus. The Man of Yorkshire and I got together again and appointed a\r\nday to start on the journey we had planned long since. We instructed\r\nAlexander the Bulgar to appear on the morning with a pair of socks in\r\nhis pocket. Alexander had the temerity to ask the reason for luggage.\r\nWe gave him no hint. Alexander was not safe enough to be trusted with\r\nthe secret. Again we hired a carriage with a Turkish driver to take us\r\nto Kalkandele; and again we succeeded in getting out of town while the\r\nTurks dozed, bound in an opposite direction.\r\n\r\nTo Egri-Palanka, the frontier town at which we proposed to leave the\r\ncarriage and take to our legs, was a two days’ journey. We spent the\r\nintervening night at a lone khan, miles away from any other habitation.\r\nThe Turk protested, and attempted to draw up at a Turkish blockhouse,\r\nbut by vigorous methods we got the horses past this danger spot at a\r\npace which did not give the Turkish officer time to make up his mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WAYFARERS AT A ROADSIDE FOUNTAIN: TURKS.]\r\n\r\nStable for beast and stable for man were one and the same at the khan,\r\nand the Turk declared the Christian food unfit to eat. We had eggs\r\nwhich had seen better days, gritty black bread, and goat’s milk with\r\nwool in it. Alexander and the Turk consumed a quantity of heady wine\r\nand advised us to do so, but we liked not the stuff. Supper over, we\r\nstretched ourselves out for the night, one upon the table, the rest\r\non benches, the other alternative being the floorless ground. There\r\nwere no rugs for us to lie on and no covering, and no one thought of\r\nundressing.\r\n\r\nWe had hardly laid ourselves down in this unholy place than the\r\n‘plagues of Egypt gat about us.’ Even across the table from which\r\nwe had supped half an hour before they came at us in battalions.\r\nAlexander and the Turk, insensible with drink, groaned and tossed, but\r\nsnored nevertheless; sleep, however, was impossible for us. We shook\r\nourselves, unbarred the doors, and escaped to the still high road,\r\nwhich we paced most of the night. It was too cold to sleep.\r\n\r\nThrough the windows we saw the sleepers by the dim light of a taper,\r\ntossing and fighting. This was some comfort to us.\r\n\r\n‘I’m glad,’ said the Man of Yorkshire when Alexander the Bulgar emerged\r\nmuch scarred from the battle of the night, hundreds of the enemy lying\r\ndead upon the expanse of his sturdy chest, ‘I am glad all was not\r\npeaceful with you and the Turk.’\r\n\r\n‘You mistake,’ said Alexander; ‘we slept profoundly.’\r\n\r\n‘Why, we saw you tossing all night long, and your groans were pitiful.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, monsieur, we drank well at supper; and though the arms moved and\r\nthe mouth talked the eyes remained closed.’\r\n\r\nAfter vast deviations to ford streams and avoid bridges, we arrived at\r\nEgri-Palanka. As we expected, a smiling police officer awaited us on\r\nthe outskirts of the town. Our escape from Uskub had been discovered,\r\nour direction traced, and instructions to turn us back had been\r\nwired on. After many gracious bows and compliments, the policeman\r\ninvited himself into our carriage, and never again left us until we\r\nleft Egri-Palanka. He conducted us to the khan, where he was joined\r\nby several gendarmes. The polite chief introduced us to the others,\r\nannouncing that they were for our service and safety, and we all\r\nsalaamed and shook hands.\r\n\r\nAfter a meal, a wash, and a short rest, we went, followed by the\r\ngendarmes, to visit the gypsy quarter, the kaimakam, and other sights.\r\nWhen we left the town to climb to the Bulgarian monastery a troop of\r\nsoldiers suddenly appeared to augment our following. The Englishman and\r\nI could have outstripped the ill-conditioned Turks in a mile, but it\r\nwas part of the game we were playing to pretend to despise walking, and\r\nwe stopped a dozen times to rest, feigning fatigue.\r\n\r\nThe high road to Uskub was without a crossing, and when we departed\r\nthe following day, bound back the way we had come, the authorities\r\nof Egri-Palanka seemed relieved and assured. Considering our foreign\r\nsusceptibilities, our escort did not surround us; it followed at a\r\ndistance of half a mile.\r\n\r\nWe pulled up the hood of the carriage--not because of the sun--and\r\nhustled the driver. At every stiff hill we got out, to relieve\r\nthe horses and to get a sight of the party in the rear. They were\r\nsuffering, apparently, from the pace we were setting. It was extremely\r\nhot, and we left them further and further behind. After an hour of this\r\nwe were quite a mile in the lead.\r\n\r\nWe had packed our few effects in shape to sling over our shoulders,\r\none sack for Alexander. At a convenient bend in the road we halted\r\nour shandrydan, passed Alexander his pack, and handed a letter to the\r\ndriver. The letter was to be delivered at Uskub that night without\r\nfail, and upon the presentation of it he was to receive his fare. Had\r\nwe paid him he would have gone to Palanka again to pick up another\r\nload. This much through the mouth of the equally bewildered Alexander,\r\nwho was then dragged from the box and hustled through three acres of\r\nstanding barley before he knew what had got him.\r\n\r\nIt came off! How we slogged through that corn and down into the valley,\r\nlooking back, with the perspiration streaming off our faces, to see our\r\ndriver toiling away through the dust, presenting a large and discreet\r\ncarriage hood to the unsuspecting escort. Presently a kindly hill shut\r\nout the road, and we struck our route by the map and the sun.\r\n\r\nThree or four miles up the road the driver would come to the military\r\npost already mentioned, where he would halt to feed his horses; the\r\nescort would overtake him, and he would tell of our flight. A couple of\r\nhours was the most we could count on before the pursuit was started.\r\n\r\nWhat a day of dodging roads and skirting villages, of scrambling up\r\nperpendicular mountain sides, and peering for Turkish patrols on the\r\nred line of high road below! It was fun the first day. We made a wager\r\nof a mijidieh, the optimistic Man of Yorkshire betting that we would\r\nnot be caught before the night. I lost. I was glad to lose--the first\r\nday. We renewed the wager for the following day.\r\n\r\nWe spied a snug, secluded little village--Christian, because there was\r\nno minaret--and dropped down to it at dark. It was Servian, and the\r\nServian schoolmaster gave us supper and shelter.\r\n\r\n‘The peasants think you are Bulgarian,’ he said.\r\n\r\n‘Committaji?’ we asked.\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ he said.\r\n\r\nWe told the schoolmaster to persuade them we were not.\r\n\r\nThere was little danger that they would bring the soldiers down upon\r\nus, knowing the habit of the Turk to visit vengeance upon the town that\r\nharbours committajis. But we learned that there were three families of\r\nTurkish peasants living in the village, and this, indeed, alarmed us.\r\nIt was quite on the cards that they would trot over to Kratovo, half an\r\nhour away, and come back with a cheery gang of Anatolians or Albanians,\r\nwhose habit in dealing with insurgents is to fire the house in which\r\nthey are and shoot them as they emerge from the flames.\r\n\r\nSo we sent our compliments to the Turks (Mohamedans must be treated\r\nwith deference) and requested them to call; which they did, and were\r\nconvinced that we were not Bulgarians. Nevertheless, we spent a most\r\nuncomfortable night. We lay on the rough gallery rolled in rugs,\r\nwatching the fireflies and listening for the ‘fire brigade,’ falling\r\nasleep from dead weariness and starting out of it at every sound.\r\n\r\nWe got away from the Servian village early the following morning,\r\ntaking a guide for the direction in which we were bound, but not\r\ndivulging our destination. We shook him off when we got the lay of the\r\ncountry and were certain of our maps again.\r\n\r\nAbout noon we dropped, as intended, into the monastery of Lesnova. We\r\nsat down by a fountain in the courtyard, the brown-timbered structure\r\nenclosing three sides, and over the mud wall on the fourth stretched\r\nthe valley into the blue distance. A palsied beggar in a filthy state\r\ndevoured food like a ravenous wolf, washing it down unchewed with\r\ngreat gulps of water. The old abbot who came out to greet us said they\r\ncould do nothing for the man’s ailments; there are no doctors in the\r\ncountry, and folk who become ill die.\r\n\r\nHere we got the first news of events which had driven the Christian\r\npeasants to Bulgaria. The story was the same we had heard so often\r\nbefore; nothing new except the details of tortures. Of these there are\r\nsufficient in later chapters; for this, the adventure of our long trail.\r\n\r\nThe monks gave us a good meal, and we slept for an hour on a\r\ncomfortable divan, for we were footsore already. The soles of my boots\r\nand those of Alexander’s--whom we had now come to call ‘Sandy’--had\r\ngone, and we were driven to native _charruks_--which, from their\r\nabsence of heels, caused me to walk as on eggs for many miles, and made\r\nmy insteps very sore. The Englishman’s clumsy foot-gear outlasted mine\r\nby many hours; still, I do not believe in British boots.\r\n\r\nShortly after one o’clock we were on the climb again, up a decent path\r\nfor once, which led over a big hill towards the town of Sletovo. A\r\ndelightful town it appeared, as we looked down from behind a bush at\r\nthe top of the hill. It was surrounded by tents, with even barracks\r\nto add a charm. The first sight of us from one of those tents by any\r\nintelligent soldier, and our trekking was over! By great luck a trail\r\nled off to the right, which seemed to skirt the tents entirely, and\r\nwe picked our way cautiously down it, concealed by a shoulder of the\r\nhill. At the bottom the trail turned straight into the town. There\r\nwas another path somewhere to the right leading away; but how to get\r\nto it? Just as we had made up our minds for a dash through some corn\r\nwe came on the connecting link, a dry watercourse, and we were soon\r\non the circular tour. But now, while keenly watching the tents to the\r\nleft, an ancient tower--probably of Roman antiquity--appeared on our\r\nright front. Outside this, with his rifle leaning against the wall,\r\nsquatted a sentry, dirgeing a dismal Oriental lay. He was not more than\r\ntwo hundred yards off, and commanded a view of our heads and shoulders\r\nabove the corn; but there was nothing for it except to go ahead. I am\r\nconfident that I watched that songster with one eye and the town on the\r\nopposite side with the other. For five minutes our fate hung on the\r\nbalance. Our hats were unmistakable; no one but a man from civilisation\r\nwears anything with a brim to it in that part of the country. Once his\r\ndull eye was caught by our headgear we were booked. But the amiable\r\ncreature sang on, his mind probably back in Anatolia; and we dropped\r\nout of sight to the next stream and took a big drink.\r\n\r\nLate that afternoon a few drops of rain came down, a delightful\r\nsensation to the parched and dusty ‘foot-slogger’; but presently this\r\nincreased to sheets of water driven before a cold wind, and for half\r\nan hour we clung, soaked, to the slimy face of a bank, with little\r\nmud waterfalls dribbling down our necks. Then the storm blew over.\r\nThe path, awkward at any time, was like a switchback skating-rink,\r\ndown which we slid and staggered with horrible swoops and marvellous\r\nrecoveries, to a boiling yellow torrent below, about as fordable as the\r\nMississippi in flood. We had hoped to do a greater distance this day,\r\nbut neither of us was sorry--though neither of us admitted it--that\r\nwe had to seek shelter on this side of the stream. There was an\r\nattractive-looking place near at hand, but a forbidding minaret stood\r\nhigh above the poplars; and we pushed on to the first Christian village.\r\n\r\nWe had slogged for two days, travelled for four; we were sore in every\r\njoint and muscle, wet to the skin, and chilled to the bone. We began\r\nto lose temper with each other, and vented our feelings upon Sandy. We\r\nspoke seldom, except at meals, when our spirits revived, and in the\r\nfresh hours of the morning. Now we were sour and snappish, and each\r\ndisagreed with whatever the other proposed. The constant strain and the\r\nheavy marching were beginning to tell on our dispositions. And we had\r\nhardly begun our journey. I was sorry I lost the bet. Perhaps the other\r\nman was too.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN A MOUNTAIN VILLAGE: BULGARIAN PEASANTS DANCING THE\r\nHORO.]\r\n\r\nThe headman of a Bulgarian village received us with the hand-shake that\r\nis the sign of friendship. He thought we were insurgents. They were\r\nharbouring one in the village. Sitting on a wooden platform under the\r\nlow thatch of his roof, we pulled off our wringing things to the last\r\nstitch, half the village looking on, absorbed and unabashed. Clad in\r\nour ‘other’ shirts (which were fortunately dry), we scrambled through\r\nthe stable to an opening through which we could discern a fire\r\nburning. Our host’s wooden sandals were not easy to keep a balance on.\r\nWith smarting eyes I groped through the smoke towards the ‘window,’ a\r\ntwo-foot hole for chickens in the wall on the ground level, and sat,\r\nfeet outstretched towards the wood fire in the middle of the hard earth\r\nfloor. By degrees I made out the hostess hanging up our garments to\r\ndry. The other man crawled towards me, and we sat coughing and blinking\r\nat the native bread-making. A flat, round, earthen dish was made red\r\nhot on the fire, then taken off and the dough slapped into it. A lid\r\nwas then buried in the embers, and, when hot enough, put on the top of\r\nthe dough. This primitive oven turns out a fine crust, but the middle\r\nof the loaf is very pasty.\r\n\r\nSandy now appeared with an armful of wet things, and hung the hats on\r\na bundle of clothes and wrappings by the fire, which began to squeal.\r\nWe discovered that this was the youngest member of the family, fast\r\napproaching a score in number.\r\n\r\nAfter the row had died down we gathered that our ‘room’ was prepared.\r\nThis consisted of the usual mud floor and walls, with a straw mat and\r\nhome-made rugs to sleep on, and a couple of red bolsters. Here we\r\nsprawled and supped under the interested eyes of a donkey and a bundle\r\nof torch-lit natives who squatted outside the door.\r\n\r\nIn the morning our toilets caused much amusement. The assembly--which,\r\nfor aught I know, watched us through the entire night--was much\r\npuzzled over what it seemed to think was an attempt on my part to\r\nswallow a small brush greased with pink paste. It broke into a general\r\nlaugh when I parted my hair, being sure I was combing it for another\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nOne of the patrols which was sent out after us--we learned\r\nlater--arrived at this village an hour after we left; but the peasants\r\nhad no idea whither we had gone.\r\n\r\nThe torrential stream had subsided into a babbling brook when we forded\r\nit, about eight o’clock, and boldly took the high road to Kotchana. We\r\nwere weary of rough mountain paths, and kept this course until within\r\ndangerous proximity of the town, then struck off into the fields--this\r\ntime rice fields. It was the season when the fields were flooded, and\r\nthe only way across was by the tops of the embankments, which held us\r\nhigh to the view of anyone in the neighbourhood. We had gone too far to\r\nretrace our steps when we discovered we were in Turkish fields. We came\r\nsuddenly to a dry patch of ground. A score or more Turkish women, their\r\nveils slung back over their shoulders, their loose black cloaks laid to\r\none side, were working the ground in their gaudy bloomers. At sight of\r\nus there was a wild flutter for veils--but not a sound.\r\n\r\nWe maintained our well-drilled blankness of expression and passed on,\r\nsoldiers three, single file. I was in advance breaking through the\r\nweeds when I stumbled upon the husband of the harem. The bey was lying\r\nsupine upon his back in the grass, a great umbrella shading his face.\r\nThe rotund gentleman grunted, and slowly opened his eyes. He seemed\r\nuncertain for a moment whether I was man or nightmare, but when I spoke\r\nhe knew he was awake. He scrambled to his feet, drew a great, gaudy\r\nrevolver, and levelled it full in my face. Of course I did not pull\r\nmy gun. I fell back, shouting quickly, as I had done on a previous\r\noccasion, ‘Inglese, Inglese effendi.’ Alexander to the rescue! That\r\nworthy, from a covered position in our rear, informed his Majesty the\r\nMohamedan that we were English, as I had said. That we were foreign\r\nChristians was evident from the fact that we carried arms. The old\r\nTurk seemed rather ashamed of the fright he had displayed, and, slyly\r\ntucking his revolver into his red sash, stepped to one side and bowed\r\nus the right of way.\r\n\r\nThis day we encountered many pitfalls. How we escaped one after\r\nanother seemed so incredible to the Turkish authorities, when we were\r\nfinally rounded up, that they seriously suspected we had come by an\r\n‘underground’ route.\r\n\r\nWe were afraid that the bey would hurry into Kotchana and inform the\r\nauthorities that two strange Franks had passed, but as long as we could\r\nsee him he still maintained his post, watching his women work. About\r\nthree hours later, however, while we were enjoying a refreshing and\r\nmuch-needed wash in a cool mountain stream, Alexander keeping watch, a\r\ncavalry patrol of half a dozen men came up at full gallop. We had just\r\ntime to duck behind a sandbank, almost beneath their horses’ hoofs.\r\n\r\nTowards midday Sandy waxed mutinous. He was a most submissive servant\r\nwhile we travelled like gentlemen, but his spirit rankled under the\r\ndangers into which he was led like a lamb. ‘If you are killed,’ he\r\nwould frequently remark, ‘your parents will receive much money, but\r\nwhat will the Turkish Government give my poor mother?’ We had not been\r\nfair to Sandy.\r\n\r\nIn skirting Vinitza the boy lay down in a corn patch and refused to\r\nbudge. The soles had again gone from his shoes, and now the soul could\r\ngo from his body. He was resigned; all Bulgarians must be martyrs. The\r\nTurks could take him.\r\n\r\nThreats availed nothing; pleading was of no use. Finally we took his\r\npack and carried it as well as our own, and promised to get a horse\r\nfor him, by pay or intimidation, from the first unarmed Bulgarian we\r\nencountered. On this condition he struggled to his feet. Poor Sandy!\r\nthe worst, for him, had not yet come.\r\n\r\nThe peasants along our route this day were numerous, for it was\r\nmarket day at Vinitza, and we had no difficulty in hiring a horse\r\nfor Alexander. Then, however, we became too conspicuous. We gathered\r\nfellow-travellers to the number of probably fifty, both Bulgars and\r\nTurks, who asked the usual innumerable questions. Sandy, in spite of\r\nall admonitions, would tell all he knew to whoever asked. We heard\r\nhim say ‘Skopia,’ ‘Palanka,’ ‘Kratovo’ in his soft Slav way. We cussed\r\nSandy, and he lied. He said he had not told them whence we had come.\r\nBut he knew no more than the natives whither we were bound!\r\n\r\nA party of Turkish peasants, much armed, spurned Sandy, and would speak\r\nwith us direct. When they discovered their dilemma their tone became\r\nsurly and insulting.\r\n\r\nWe passed through a long, narrow defile most fragrant with honeysuckle\r\nand wild roses, and occasional cool breaths from the pines on the\r\nslopes above came down to us. A sense of peace pervaded the place,\r\nand, growing accustomed to our company, we enjoyed the relief of a\r\ncomparatively good road and no towns or encampments. But the pass came\r\nto an abrupt termination, and there at its mouth sat a band of twenty\r\nsoldiers! For a few minutes things looked rather nasty, but our British\r\nand American passports, with their huge red seals, were so impressive\r\nto the ignorant soldiers that they feared to lay hands on us. They\r\nasked whither we were going, and we replied, ‘Towards Pechovo.’ But on\r\nfalling behind the next hill in that direction we deserted our peasant\r\nfollowing and struck off on our own route.\r\n\r\nThis was the longest day’s track we made. We covered thirty miles\r\nin ten hours; during which our midday meal was off a loaf of bread\r\nbought for a metaleek from a peasant Turk. I gave him a piastre and he\r\ninsisted on giving me change.\r\n\r\nWe encountered a Bulgarian who lived on a hillside about an hour off,\r\njoined him, and wended our way to his hut for our last night in hiding.\r\nI owed the Man of Yorkshire still another mijidieh.\r\n\r\nWe slept in the open, under a tree; the hut was too full.\r\n\r\nWe rose very early in the morning and started off on three miserable\r\nponies gathered by our host from neighbouring mountain men. We had\r\nhardly proceeded two hundred yards when we were challenged by a Turkish\r\npost. A dilapidated blockhouse stood at the foot of the hill on which\r\nwe had slept, and our slumbers would not have been so peaceful had\r\neither we or the Turks known of the others’ presence. The soldiers were\r\nunofficered and could not read, and an attitude of assurance, supported\r\nby our red seals, again passed us on.\r\n\r\nThe man who accompanied us to bring back the horses had just returned\r\nfrom Bulgaria, whither he had fled leaving a pretty wife and six small\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n‘Brute!’ observed the Man of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n‘Ah, well! One can always get another wife!’ said Sandy.\r\n\r\nThe mountain men had been able to give us only bread to put into our\r\npacks, but as we skirted Tsarevoselo, the peasant--who could enter\r\nthe place without being noticed--went in and procured two large lumps\r\nof sugar. Sweetened bread and cool water from a fall made our lunch;\r\nafter which we plodded on, until an hour after nightfall we entered\r\nDjuma-bala.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TURKISH QUARTER: DJUMA-BALA.]\r\n\r\n‘How long do you give the police?’ asked the Man of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n‘Fifteen minutes,’ I replied.\r\n\r\nThe first of them arrived in five.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had done half our journey--the hardest half. We were certain of the\r\nrest. We expected some difficulty with the Turks, and we had much.\r\n\r\nSandy disappeared. We knew where to look for him. We went to the\r\ngaol and demanded his release. And the Turks released him. They were\r\npositive that he was the committaji who had brought us through their\r\ncountry, and they refused to let him proceed with us. After discussion\r\nby wire--which required several days--instructions came from our old\r\nfriend Hilmi Pasha to send us back, without our Sandy. But we refused\r\nto go without Sandy. This deadlock lasted for a week. Meanwhile we\r\ntelegraphed to the British Consul-General at Salonica, signing the\r\ntelegrams in one instance ‘Moore and Booth,’ in another ‘Booth and\r\nMoore.’ Translated into Turkish the signatures arrived at the Consulate\r\n‘Mor-o-bos’ in one case, ‘Bot-o-more’ in the other. We were known to\r\nour friends by these names thereafter.\r\n\r\nThe Consul visited Hilmi Pasha (who was then in Salonica), and got\r\npermission for us to proceed with our dragoman. Hilmi had some hard\r\nwords for us, the least of which were ‘Ces vagabonds!’\r\n\r\nWe received a telegram in Turkish from the Consul, and took it to\r\nthe kaimakam for interpretation. The kaimakam read, ‘Monsieur Boot\r\net Monsieur Mo-ré, you may depart for Drama, as you desire, but your\r\ninterpreter must be left behind.’\r\n\r\nWe felt somewhat sick.\r\n\r\nAnother telegram to the Consul-General.\r\n\r\nThe reply came at midnight. In the morning we took it to a Christian.\r\nWe told him nothing of the kaimakam’s interpretation of the first. He\r\npuzzled over the characters for a few minutes, then wrote in French,\r\n‘Telegraphed to you yesterday, Hilmi Pasha gives permission to proceed\r\nto Drama and take interpreter.’\r\n\r\nWe went back to the kaimakam. He offered us chairs, but we declined to\r\nsit. He offered us cigarettes, and we declined them.\r\n\r\n‘Kaimakam Bey,’ said we, ‘we are going out of here to-morrow morning\r\nand our interpreter is going with us. Good-morning.’\r\n\r\nWe turned on our heels and left without salaaming to the bey or to any\r\nof his sitting satellites.\r\n\r\nThe kaimakam jumped to his feet and followed us to the door shouting,\r\n‘Ce n’est pas ma faute, messieurs. Ce n’est pas ma faute!’\r\n\r\nAn hour later an officer who had been attached to us during our sojourn\r\nat Djuma was ushered in by Sandy. He came to present the kaimakam’s\r\ncompliments and to say that by a strange coincidence the permission we\r\nsought had just arrived from the Governor-General.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUINS OF KREMEN.]\r\n\r\nWe rode away from Djuma-bala with a large escort, and made our way\r\nslowly through the wildest and most beautiful mountains I have ever\r\nseen. We worked around Perim Dagh to Mahomia; spent a night at Bansko,\r\nwhere Miss Stone had been ransomed; passed through the ruins of Kremen,\r\nthe scene of a wicked massacre; dropped down the river Mesta by a\r\nlong-untrodden path; crossed a trackless lava formation of many miles\r\nthat resembled a vast boneyard of giant skulls and scattered skeletons.\r\nThe trail was hard, and it took four days to get to Drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE TRAIL OF THE INSURGENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Consuls and two newspaper correspondents cordoned at the storm\r\ncentre received comprehensive and accurate reports of what was\r\nhappening in the surrounding country through a secret emissary of\r\nthe revolutionary committee. This envoy extraordinary, pleading his\r\ncause before the foreign representatives at a hostile capital, was\r\na man of nerve, resource, and careful judgment, as well he had to\r\nbe. Besides his other accomplishments, he had a knowledge of three\r\nEuropean languages, French, German, and Italian, and was therefore\r\nable to translate the official insurgent reports from the original\r\nBulgarian into languages understood of the Consuls. The contents of\r\nthese periodical papers were a record of recent activities on the part\r\nof both insurgents and Turks. Combats and massacres were located, and\r\nwhere possible the numbers of killed and wounded were given. The final\r\nreport was a summary of the summer’s work. It announced the razing,\r\npartial or entire, of 120 villages, and stated that 60,000 peasants\r\nin the vilayet of Monastir were homeless. Illustrating the report was\r\na map which had been drafted by a skilled hand and manifolded by\r\nmachine; a key in the corner explained the meanings of the different\r\nintensities of colour in which the villages were marked, from white,\r\nindicating total escape, to black, total effacement.\r\n\r\nThe dissemination of such information during the ‘general rising’\r\ndefeated the designs of the lawful administration, and, of course, the\r\nTurkish police were hard on the trail of the enemy in their midst.\r\nHitherto it had been the practice of the Governor-General (who, like\r\nus, had left Uskub for more active fields) to inform foreign consuls\r\nonly of such serious disorders as he could not hope to keep from\r\nthem. Until now the number of casualties on the Turkish side in any\r\nsingle combat had been limited to ‘three killed and two wounded,’ and\r\nthe Imperial Ottoman reports invariably defeated the ‘brigands.’ Now\r\nthe limit of losses had to be raised, because of consular scepticism\r\nas to their accuracy, but still no record of defeat at the hands of\r\nthe insurgents was ever permitted. Insurgent bands seldom numbered\r\nmore than a hundred; nevertheless, his Excellency Hilmi Pasha would\r\noccasionally announce a loss to them of several hundreds. Invariably\r\nsuch a ‘destruction of brigands’ proved on unofficial information\r\nto be a massacre of non-combatants. It annoyed the chief officer of\r\nreforms exceedingly that foreign consuls and correspondents should give\r\ncredence to the reports of the insurgents in preference to those of his\r\noffice. His worry, however, was only on the score of effect in Europe;\r\nthe tacit implication as to his veracity disturbed his excellency\r\nindeed very little.\r\n\r\nA square-jawed Servian of some six-and-twenty years, dressed as a\r\nEuropean with the exception of the fez, entered the Hôtel Belgrade\r\nfor a cup of coffee--one act which never attracts suspicion. The café\r\nof the distinguished hostelry was otherwise deserted except for the\r\nEnglishman and me. The stranger seated himself near us, looked us over\r\nwhile he sipped his coffee, then addressed us cautiously.\r\n\r\n‘You are English correspondents?’ he inquired in a low voice in German.\r\n\r\n‘We are,’ said my comprehending companion.\r\n\r\n‘I have a confidential communication to make. Will you take me to your\r\nroom?’\r\n\r\nWe went to the Englishman’s room, and the Servian explained his\r\nmission; whereupon he opened the door and called in a boy, not over\r\nfifteen, clad in a Greek gabardine, and carrying a basket of eggs.\r\n\r\nThis was our first meeting with the agent of the revolutionary\r\ncommittee. Of course, the papers meant for us were among the eggs.\r\n\r\nFor many weeks thereafter the envoy extraordinary and his youthful\r\nfirst secretary delivered the incriminating documents, but seldom twice\r\nin the same manner.\r\n\r\nOne day we received a message asking us to meet the insurgent at a\r\ncertain house within the hour; the case was imperative. We made our way\r\nto the place indicated, and there received the revolutionist’s report\r\nwith the map already mentioned. The man apologised for being unable\r\nto bring his final paper to us, and continued, ‘I must not be seen in\r\nthe street to-day. They have my brother. They came to the house this\r\nmorning while I was out and took him. The boy found me, and warned me\r\nnot to return. For me it is fortunate that my work here is done.’\r\n\r\nWe never saw the Servian committaji again, and do not know that he\r\neluded his pursuers; perhaps they were too close on his trail.\r\n\r\nMonastir was thronged with Turkish warriors, Albanians, Anatolians,\r\nand European Turks, soldiers and bashi-bazouks, hale men and halt men;\r\na one-armed soldier and a hump-backed dwarf carried guns, Turk and\r\nTurk alike. The vast barracks was overcrowded, tents stretched across\r\nthe parade ground, otherwise seldom utilised, and climbed high up the\r\nmountain behind the caserne. The military hospital was surrounded\r\nby tents. A certain subdued delight fills the breast of the gentle\r\nTurk, and renders the combative Albanian loyal to the Padisha, when\r\nthe native _rajah_ gives cause for castigation. There is glory for\r\nMohamed in the despatch of an infidel, and material profit in the\r\nplunder reaped.[6] Nearly a hundred thousand Albanian and Turkish\r\nsoldiers were crowded into the Monastir vilayet to ‘repress’ the ‘armed\r\ninsurrection,’ and such resident Mohamedans as were not called to the\r\ncolours sharpened their yataghans and joined unorganised in the work of\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\nWith this force on the warpath the town became quiet. Such Bulgarians\r\nas had not gone to the mountains became Greeks or Servians, and for\r\na time the race disappeared from the streets. Greeks and Vlachs also\r\nkept close to their houses, and some days only soldiers selling plunder\r\nheld the market place. The army commandeered the better pack-animals\r\nand teams as they appeared on the streets, paying for them in paper\r\npromises--in consequence whereof all fit animals were soon kept\r\nstabled. Honest toil ceased, and only the labour of the struggle\r\ncontinued. In the early morning, before the town stirred, detachments\r\nof troops started for the mountains with many pack-ponies, each laden\r\nwith four ample tins of petroleum. At night, when Monastir was still\r\nagain, the pack-ponies came back--bringing in the wounded of the Turks.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary committee had declared the ‘general rising’ of\r\nthe peasants with less than ten thousand rifles of all patterns,[7]\r\na meagre force with which to contest the Ottoman authority, and a\r\npoor result for the price that had been paid in men and morals. The\r\ninsurgents had been gathering arms for several years. Many murders\r\nhad been committed in Macedonia in the forced collection of levied\r\nassessments, and some had taken place in Bulgaria; many massacres of\r\ninnocent peasants had been brought about in the Turkish search for\r\narms; many insurgents had given their lives fetching the arms from\r\nfriendly and hostile frontiers.[8]\r\n\r\nThe high chiefs of the committee never expected to defeat the Turks\r\nwith their inadequate force of untrained peasants; their purpose was to\r\nprovoke the Sultan to set his soldiers upon the Christians. They were\r\nwilling to pay the lives of many thousands of their brother Macedonians\r\nfor the accomplishment of their desire--the country’s autonomy. They\r\nwere fanatics. The Turks called them Christian fanatics, but it was\r\nnot only the insurgents who were frenzied; probably 40,000 men, women,\r\nand children, the entire population of many villages, went to the\r\nmountains unarmed. This was the general rising. And all the Bulgarians\r\nwho remained in their villages, and many other Macedonians, gave their\r\nwhole sympathy to the cause of the committajis.\r\n\r\nThe revolution was declared in the vilayet of Monastir, among other\r\nreasons, because of a specific design upon the Greek communities. You\r\nhave seen in a previous chapter how the Turks at repression recognised\r\nno difference between Greeks and Bulgarians, massacring both alike,\r\neven though the Greek clergy had some assurance that Bulgarians alone\r\nwould be ‘repressed.’ The insurgents understood the Turk better. They\r\nlaid deliberate plans to draw him down upon the communities of hostile\r\npolitics. By capturing lightly garrisoned towns whose inhabitants\r\nadhered to the Greek Church, putting the Turkish soldiers to death,\r\nthey drew the Turks in force to the retaking of these places, whence\r\nthey (the insurgents) would cautiously withdraw, leaving the ‘Greeks’\r\nto the vengeance of the Mohamedans. They argued that measure must\r\nbe met by measure; Greek priests converted by threatening Bulgarian\r\npeasants with the Turk.\r\n\r\nA storm of protest came from Athens, directed chiefly against one\r\nBakhtiar Pasha, simultaneously commander of the most bloodthirsty body\r\nof soldiers and the most rapacious band of bashi-bazouks, who put to\r\nthe sword and the torch both exarchist and patriarchist community.\r\nWith the support of ambassadors of the Powers, the Greek Minister at\r\nConstantinople demanded the immediate relief of this general from\r\nhis command ‘in the interest and honour of the Turkish army’; and\r\nthe Sultan, always tractable under pressure, promised to punish the\r\noffending pasha. Forthwith the deviceful monarch despatched a special\r\nmessenger from Constantinople to Monastir, bearing congratulations and\r\nthe Order of the Mijidieh in diamonds for Bakhtiar the Brave.\r\n\r\nBut there came a day when Abdul Hamid kept a promise. Two ‘Greek’\r\ntowns, Nevaska and Klissura, were captured by insurgents and the\r\nTurkish garrison put to death. Some time elapsed before the Turks\r\nsaw fit to retake the towns, and during the interval the Sultan was\r\npersuaded not ‘to further alienate Greek sympathies.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TURKISH BAND LEAVING MONASTIR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BASHI-BAZOUKS.]\r\n\r\nAt the approach of a strong body of Turks the insurgents retired, and\r\nthe soldiers entered the town in military order, blades sheathed, and\r\nleading no asses laden with petroleum.[9]\r\n\r\nBut massacre and the burning of villages continued, and refugees\r\nentered Monastir in large numbers, some coming in alone, others\r\ntravelling in companies. Several hundred women and children who arrived\r\nfrom Smelivo, one of Bakhtiar’s ‘victories,’ were driven back from\r\nMonastir by troops, though without further reduction of their numbers.\r\nThe news of this came to the Consuls in a very few hours, and the\r\nAustrian, who was most active, visited the Governor-General at once and\r\nprotested; whereupon the survivors of Smelivo were allowed to enter\r\nMonastir.\r\n\r\nOne day a woman among the refugees went to Herr Kraal and asked him to\r\nobtain the release of a son, whom she had thought dead, but had seen\r\nalive in the custody of certain Turks. The Consul caused his dragoman\r\nto ascertain where the boy was kept, and on learning the exact house,\r\nhe called on Hilmi Pasha and stated the case. His excellency was\r\nhorrified at such a charge against a Turk. For what purpose would a\r\nMohamedan steal a Christian child? The Consul gave the Governor-General\r\nthe location of the house, and threatened to send his dragoman and\r\nkavasses to release the child unless the police were put to the job at\r\nonce. An Austrian dragoman accompanied the Turkish police; the boy was\r\nfound and restored to his mother.\r\n\r\nThere was a Greek in Monastir known as a professional redeemer\r\nof stolen Christians. Through the instrumentality of the Greek\r\nVice-Consul, Jean Dragoumis, this curious character and I were brought\r\ntogether. I ascertained from him that he had, in a period of twenty\r\nyears, participated in the rescue of seventeen of his compatriots. Most\r\nof them were girls and women stolen by force or enticed from their\r\nown homes by Mohamedans. The most recent instance of this fortunately\r\ninfrequent practice occurred, the native alleged, during our presence\r\nin Monastir. Two small boys were brought into Monastir by a Turkish\r\nsoldier and ‘offered for sale on the market place’ along with other\r\nplunder. A subscription was raised among some Greeks, according to\r\nmy informant, and the children were ‘purchased’ from the Turk for\r\nfour mijidiehs. ‘Since Herr Kraal has protested,’ said the rescuer of\r\nChristians, ‘orders have been issued that no more stolen children\r\nshall be brought into Monastir.’ Jean Dragoumis himself, a splendid\r\nyoung Greek, interpreted for me on this occasion.\r\n\r\nIt is always difficult in Turkey to know just what is true and what\r\nis false. Even the peasants will attempt, for one consideration\r\nor another, to impose upon the stranger. Sometimes they invent\r\nor embellish incidents simply for vain notoriety, and again with\r\ndeliberate intent to prejudice your sympathy. The refugees who came\r\ninto Monastir from the surrounding country told some terrible tales.\r\nThey told of dead lying unburied by the roadway, where they had been\r\nshot for no other reason than their race--which was undoubtedly\r\ntrue. They told in many instances of dogs gorging upon the unburied\r\ndead--which is quite probable; the hungry, bread-fed dogs of Turkey\r\nwould devour any flesh. They told, in one case, of children having been\r\nthrown alive into a burning lime-kiln--which is possible. They told of\r\nwomen having been flayed alive--which I do not believe; it is not in\r\nthe Turk’s nature to inflict lingering torture.\r\n\r\nMy companion and I saw among the refugees in the Greek hospital a\r\nwoman whose shoulder had been almost severed from her body with a\r\nsingle sword slash; another woman whose hand had been cut off with a\r\nsabre--the arm, she said, had held her infant, which was hacked to\r\npieces at her feet. We saw a small boy who had been shot through the\r\nhead, and a small girl who had been stabbed in several places. These\r\nwere the most cruel of many cases in the hospital.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion we succeeded in entering the Turkish civil hospital,\r\nwhere there were a number of wounded Bulgarians. In a women’s ward,\r\nwhere bandaged heads and limbs were in plain evidence, the dutiful\r\ndoctor, a Greek, informed us that his patients were all suffering from\r\n‘feminine complaints.’\r\n\r\n‘But,’ we said, ‘some of them appear to be wounded.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, a few,’ replied the loyal servant of the Sultan, ‘must have\r\nattempted to commit suicide. They were found with wounds.’\r\n\r\nAt the barred door of a prison ward, through which we could see\r\nbandaged men, we were told, for variety, that this was the ‘accident’\r\nward. We inquired what comprised accidents.\r\n\r\n‘Some fell out of trees, others amputated their own arms while cutting\r\nwood.’ This deviceful M.D. was indeed worthy of the Sultan’s service.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the revolution a Turkish proclamation addressed to\r\nthe peasants in the mountains was placarded throughout the vilayet. It\r\nread, in true Ottoman fashion, in part as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURKS ON THE MARCH.]\r\n\r\n‘There is no need to mention how much his Imperial Majesty the Padisha,\r\nour benefactor and enlightened master, desires the prosperity of\r\nthe country and the welfare of all his subjects without exception,\r\nsacrificing sleep and quiet day and night, thinking how to perfect his\r\nlofty purposes, and therefore commands the execution of certain\r\nbenefits. Everywhere courts are approved and established for the\r\npreservation of the rights of the people; for the guarding of faithful\r\nsubjects and the execution of the laws bodies of police and gendarmes\r\nare enlisted; for the saving of life and property guards are appointed;\r\nfor the spreading of education schools are opened; roads and bridges\r\nare constructed for the people to carry food and merchandise; as also\r\nare begun everywhere various other needed benefits, and for this end\r\npart of the local income is apportioned.’\r\n\r\n(‘I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of the\r\nproclamation to the Bulgarians,’ ran the official report of the British\r\nConsul covering this document. ‘The list of reforms accomplished is\r\npurely illusory!’)\r\n\r\n‘But some evil-minded ones,’ continued the proclamation, ‘not wishing\r\nthe people to be benefited by these favours, and regarding only their\r\nown selfish interest, deceive the inhabitants and commit various\r\nrepulsive transgressions. There is not the least ground for the\r\nlies and assurances with which the Bulgarians are deceived. All the\r\ncivilised people of Europe and elsewhere regard with horror their\r\ndeeds, which destroy the peace of the land, and everywhere--with great\r\nimpatience--the suppression of these enemies to peace and order is\r\nawaited. The Imperial Government observes with sorrow that many people\r\nstill rebel notwithstanding that until now, because of its great\r\nmercy, it has proceeded with marked clemency toward the agitators.\r\nBut since the Government cannot coolly see the order of the country\r\ndestroyed and the peaceful population subjected to murders and other\r\nevils, it categorically orders the commanders of the troops, wherever\r\nthey are sent, to disperse and kill _most severely_ the disturbers\r\nand their followers who still remain in rebellion. Therefore, for the\r\nlast time, the Bulgarians who have been deceived and have left their\r\nfireside and their trades are invited to return to their homes and\r\nvillages, and those who do not return and run towards the mercy of the\r\nImperial Government will be punished and _destroyed in the severest\r\nfashion_.’[10]\r\n\r\nThe rebels did not run toward the mercy of the Imperial Government,\r\nbut many of them, because of their privations with the bands and the\r\napproach of winter, began to return from the mountains to their homes\r\nor the sites of them, seeking on all occasions to avoid the Turkish\r\ntroops. I heard an account of how in one instance a party of some\r\nforty men and a hundred women and children received a message from a\r\ndetachment of the army promising them safety if they would return to\r\ntheir village, and with this specific assurance they ventured back.\r\nThey were met on the way by the Turks, and the men were manacled and\r\nmarched away towards Florina, where, the Turks said, their names would\r\nbe recorded and they would then be set free. About half-way to town\r\nthey met a larger body of soldiers, commanded by a superior officer,\r\nwho demanded why Bulgarians had been made prisoners. No adequate reply\r\nforthcoming, the ranking man gave orders that the peasants should be\r\nput to death forthwith. The troops set upon the handcuffed men, slew\r\nthem, and decapitated their bodies. The headless bodies, so the story\r\ngoes, were thrown into the stream. What became of the heads none could\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n(A photographer at Monastir has, in former years, taken many pictures\r\nof Turkish soldiers and officers standing behind tables on which were\r\nlaid the battered heads of Bulgarians and other ‘brigands.’ But heads\r\nare no longer brought into Monastir, and the photographer has been\r\nforbidden to display all pictures of this nature. I was able, however,\r\nto procure some.)\r\n\r\nOn a visit to Hilmi Pasha’s office soon after this incident I took\r\noccasion to mention it to his excellency. He was completely ignorant of\r\nthe story, and asked me for details.\r\n\r\n‘No, no, Monsieur Moore,’ he declared when I concluded; ‘none of the\r\nSultan’s men would do such a deed.’\r\n\r\n‘But your excellency,’ I said, ‘I know that the Metropolitan of Florina\r\ncalled on the kaimakam and requested him to have the bodies drawn out\r\nof the water and buried. The main facts of the story cannot be denied.’\r\n\r\n‘Where did you say the Bulgarians were from?’ asked the Governor.\r\n\r\nI consulted my note-book and told him.\r\n\r\n‘There is no such place.’\r\n\r\n‘Perhaps I have not pronounced the name properly, but the act of\r\ntreachery remains,’ I contended.\r\n\r\n‘Ah, yes,’ said Hilmi, ‘the town was ----;[11] I recollect now.\r\nMonsieur Moore, Turks never lie. With your pronunciation and the\r\nerror in the figures you gave I did not recognise the affair. There\r\nwere sixty Bulgarians killed, not forty. But the deed was not one of\r\ntreachery; it happened two days before the Sultan granted pardon to the\r\nrebels.’\r\n\r\nThe inspector-general volunteered some further information on other\r\naffairs, notably that of Krushevo. At first the Turks contended that\r\nthe insurgents had burned and pillaged the Vlach town. Now Hilmi Pasha\r\ninformed me that bashi-bazouks had done the work. ‘The officers,’ he\r\nsaid, ‘tried to keep them off the heels of the army, but they were\r\nmany, many, and while occupied fighting the insurgents the troops\r\ncould not prevent the bashi-bazouks from plundering. I have had thirty\r\nbashi-bazouks arrested, and I have just received a report from one\r\nof my officers stating that four thousand animals, which were driven\r\noff by the bashi-bazouks, have been returned to the inhabitants of\r\nKrushevo.’\r\n\r\nThis statement was both an important admission and an interesting\r\nannouncement, and I sent it at once to the _Times_, for which I was\r\nnow correspondent. But a few days later on visiting Krushevo I was\r\ncompelled to contradict his excellency’s information as to the\r\nreturn of stolen cattle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURKISH TROOPS.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the efforts of the authorities to suppress the news of\r\nwhat was happening, and to gull the correspondents, we were able to\r\ncollect much valuable information, and through the Consular post to get\r\nour despatches safely to the Servian frontier, whence they were wired\r\nto London uncensored. When the Governor-General learned--_via_ London\r\nand Constantinople--the nature of the reports the correspondents were\r\nsending through, he was much disturbed, and sought to frighten us out\r\nof the country. He sent a communication to Mr. McGregor informing him\r\nthat he had received a letter from the committajis announcing that they\r\nintended to assassinate a British consul, a British correspondent,\r\nor an American missionary. The Consul--I use his words--considered\r\nthis ‘a step taken by the authorities in order to cast suspicion\r\non the Bulgarians in the much more likely eventuality of a Turkish\r\noutrage,’ and ‘consequently reminded Hilmi Pasha that, whatever the\r\nnationality of anyone guilty of a crime against a British subject, the\r\nresponsibility of the Imperial Government will be the same.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nON THE TRACK OF THE TURK\r\n\r\n\r\nA rude shaking roused me from my slumbers at the early hour of\r\n4.30 A.M., and I discovered myself in the clutches of a tremendous\r\nAlbanian, a skirted fellow wearing wicked weapons. His remarks were\r\nunintelligible to me, but he presented a card containing a few words in\r\nbad English. It was from a consul, a man who gave me much assistance,\r\nand read:\r\n\r\n‘Be ready for ten o’clock Turkish; an Albanian which can be trusted\r\nshall bring horses, and you shall be taken to Krushevo.’\r\n\r\nI surrendered.\r\n\r\nThis was the morning after my interview with Hilmi Pasha, at which\r\nI had received the Turkish version of the Krushevo affair. Was I to\r\ndefeat the Governor-General again?\r\n\r\nMy dragoman and I were ready when the guide arrived, and in less than\r\neight hours we were ‘taken to Krushevo.’\r\n\r\nThe Monastir Valley was almost deserted. Bridges were down, and we\r\nforded the rivers. Occasionally parties of soldiers and bashi-bazouks\r\nwere potting at something, perhaps at peasants. Near Krushevo we\r\npassed Turks on the road, some carrying short adzes and axes in their\r\nsashes, as the Albanian wears his yataghan; others bore hand-pumps of\r\nreed.\r\n\r\nOur difficulties were not serious. We traversed the long plain without\r\nmishap, and began at noon to climb the tall mountain to the Vlach town\r\nin the sky.\r\n\r\nA party of Albanians drove pack-animals to the ruins of a Greek\r\nmonastery half-way up the mountain, to gather the petroleum tins, still\r\nlying about the walls. There were tracks of the Turks everywhere. Here\r\na company had camped, there a battery had been posted, across a fissure\r\nin the mountain Adam Aga’s bashi-bazouks had divided booty; barricades\r\nof stone where the tents had been, earthworks for the guns, the carcase\r\nof a stolen ass, killed to settle dispute between Moslem claimants.\r\nThere was trace of the insurgents, too; a dozen Turkish graves on a\r\nlevel bank, around them a score of black ghosts, the wives of the slain\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nWe reached the ruins of the guardhouse at the high point in the road\r\nand dropped into the wrecked town; there was not a moment to lose. Our\r\nstay in Krushevo was of doubtful duration; how long we could avoid the\r\nclutches of the garrison was a question. There was yet daylight, and\r\nthe use of the camera might be restricted to-morrow. A Turk saw me hand\r\nover my tired horse and anxiously unstrap my kodak. He knew what it\r\nwas, and told me not to use it. But this took a minute to translate,\r\nand my instrument but a second to snap. He was a mild-mannered man, and\r\ninstead of taking me in hand himself, he set off to the kaimakam for\r\ninstructions, and I plunged into the wreckage, lost to him for an hour.\r\n\r\nNatives in long gabardines and fezzes emerged from holes and hollow\r\nwalls and followed me. A young girl spoke English; she attended the\r\nmission school at Monastir. A Vlach home from Rome to marry also spoke\r\nEnglish. He and his sweetheart had survived, though they had lost\r\neverything they had. The insurgents had made him pay fifty pounds\r\n(Turkish), for which he held a paper note redeemable with interest by\r\nthe Principality of Macedonia! Another Vlach invited me to his home,\r\nwhich the Turks had not visited till the petroleum gave out; it was,\r\ntherefore, only pillaged.\r\n\r\nThe doors were splintered where the adzes had been applied. The\r\nhouse was bare, stripped of every rug. A rough wooden table had been\r\nconstructed of a barn door and blocks of wood. The younger members of\r\nthe family were sent scurrying to the neighbours. From one came a bowl,\r\nfrom another two iron forks and a spoon, which had been saved from the\r\nTurks. We got a supper, all eating from the big bowl, the family with\r\ntheir fingers.\r\n\r\nWe spent the night here. It was a memorable night.\r\n\r\nThe house stood high upon a rock and overlooked the area of hollow\r\nwalls. Ruined Vlachs slunk in through the night, sat with us on the\r\nbalcony, and, whispering, told us the tale of their city. In the dim\r\nlight of a crescent moon they pointed out the Konak where the Turks had\r\nbeen killed, the woods above where the spies had been executed, the\r\nGreek school which the insurgents had used as Government offices, and\r\n‘Hell Hole,’ still containing bodies.\r\n\r\nOnce the Vlachs stopped abruptly and changed the subject to England.\r\nWhat sort of a place was Angleterre?\r\n\r\n‘A pretty good place,’ I replied, ‘but you should see America.’\r\n\r\n‘They are the same country.’\r\n\r\nI reverted to Krushevo.\r\n\r\nThe Vlach who spoke English interrupted:\r\n\r\n‘The man who has just arrived is a spy.’\r\n\r\nThe Vlach traitor knew he was known, and looked sheepish. He did not\r\nremain long, and I got the rest of the account that night, making notes\r\nin the dark.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of Krushevo:\r\n\r\nJust after midnight on the morning of August 2, 1903 (this was the\r\nday that the general rising was proclaimed), a rattle of rifles and a\r\nprolonged hurrahing broke the quiet of the peaceful mountain town. Some\r\nthree hundred insurgents under ‘Peto-the-Vlach’ and four other leaders\r\nhad taken the town by surprise. In the little rock-built caserne were\r\nfifteen Turkish soldiers, and in the Konak and private houses were ten\r\nor twelve Turkish officials and their families and a few soldiers. The\r\ninhabitants of the town were Christians, Wallachians (or Vlachs) in\r\nthe majority, and a colony of Bulgarians. The soldiers were able to\r\ngrab their rifles and escape from the caserne, killing eight or more\r\ninsurgents as they fled. The night was black, and a steep, rocky slope\r\nbehind the building lent an easy exit. The Turkish telegraph clerk\r\nlikewise escaped; but the Government officials who were in the town\r\ndied to a man. The kaimakam was absent on a visit to Monastir.\r\n\r\nAfter surrounding the Government buildings to prevent the escape of the\r\nTurks, the insurgents broke into the shops and appropriated all the\r\npetroleum they could find. This they pumped on the Konak, the caserne,\r\nand the telegraph offices with the municipal fire-pump, and applied the\r\ntorch. From fifteen to twenty Turkish soldiers and officials were shot\r\ndown as they emerged from the flames; but the women and children were\r\ngiven safe escort to a Vlach house, with the exception of one woman and\r\na girl who fell as they came out. Whether they were shot by accident or\r\nintention on the part of a committaji is not known.\r\n\r\nThe flames spread, and a dozen private houses and stores were burned\r\nwith the Turkish buildings. Some, I believe, were set afire to light\r\nthe Konak and make certain the death of the Turks.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the insurgents placed red flags about the town and\r\nformed a provisional Government, appointing a commission of the\r\ninhabitants, consisting of two Bulgarians and three Wallachians, ‘to\r\nprovide for the needs of the day and current affairs.’ Without\r\ninstruction all the inhabitants discarded the fez.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VLACHS.]\r\n\r\nThree chiefs of bands were appointed, a military commission, whose\r\nduties were drastic. Their first act was to condemn to death two ardent\r\nPatriarchists who had spied for the Turks on the organisation and\r\npreparations of the local committee for insurrection in the district.\r\nThe men were made prisoners, taken into the woods, and slain.\r\n\r\nOn the first day the insurgents made a house-to-house visitation\r\nand requested donations of food, and later required any lead that\r\ncould be moulded into rifle balls. More bands arrived, and a number\r\nof Bulgarians and Wallachs of the town joined the insurgent ranks,\r\naltogether augmenting the number to over six hundred. They began at\r\nonce to raise fortifications, and made two wooden cannon such as had\r\nbeen used in the Bulgarian revolt of the ’seventies. The cannon were\r\nworthless, and were left to the Turks, who brought one of them into\r\nMonastir.\r\n\r\nOn the second day the men of the town who possessed wealth were\r\nsummoned to appear before the military commission. A list had been made\r\n(the information given by members of the organisation whose homes were\r\nin Krushevo) of the standing and approximate wealth of each ‘notable’\r\nin the community. As these headmen appeared before the triumvirate a\r\nsum in proportion to his means was demanded from each. No protests\r\nand no pleading affected the commission, and in every instance the\r\nmoney was forthcoming within the time limit. More than 1,000_l._ was\r\ncollected in this way, and in exchange was given printed paper money,\r\nredeemable at the liberation of Macedonia.\r\n\r\nOn the following Sunday the priests of both the Greek and the Bulgarian\r\nchurches were ordered to hold a requiem for the repose of the souls of\r\nthe committajis who had fallen in the capture of Krushevo. Detachments\r\nof insurgents were present, in arms, and gave the service a strange\r\nmilitary tone. Open-air meetings were held on the same day, and the\r\npeople were addressed by the leaders of the bands.\r\n\r\nDuring the ten days of the insurgent occupation sentinels and patrols\r\nsaw to the order and tranquillity of the town, and no cruelties were\r\ncommitted. Business, however, was paralysed. The market place was\r\nclosed and provisions diminished; and attempts to introduce flour\r\nfailed, the emissaries to the neighbouring villages being stopped by\r\nTurkish soldiers and bashi-bazouks, who were gathering about the town.\r\n\r\nThe news of the capture of Krushevo reached Monastir August 3, but not\r\nuntil nine days later was an attempt made to retake the place. By that\r\ntime three thousand soldiers, with eighteen cannon, had been assembled.\r\nAbout the town, also, were three or four thousand bashi-bazouks from\r\nTurkish villages in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nWhen the guns were in position on favourable heights above the town,\r\nBakhtiar Pasha, the commander of the troops, sent down a written\r\nmessage asking the insurgents to surrender. The insurgents refused,\r\nand an artillery fire was begun. Most of the insurgents then escaped\r\nthrough a thick wood which appeared to have been left open for them,\r\nbut some took up favourable positions on the mountain roads leading\r\ninto the town, others occupied barricaded buildings in the outskirts,\r\nand resisted the Turks for awhile. Two of the leaders, Peto and\r\nIvanoff, died fighting.\r\n\r\nPeto-the-Vlach was a picturesque character. He was thirty-five years\r\nof age, a native of Krushevo. He had been fighting the Turks for\r\nseventeen years. He was made prisoner in 1886 and exiled to Asia Minor.\r\nBut benefiting by one of the frequent general amnesties he returned\r\nto Macedonia, rejoined the insurrectionary movement, and led the\r\norganisation of Krushevo and the neighbouring district.\r\n\r\nAt a conference of the leaders immediately prior to the Turkish attack,\r\nPeto declared that he would never surrender his town back to the\r\noppressor; the others could escape if they would, the Turks could not\r\nagain enter Krushevo except over his dead body. With eighteen men who\r\nelected to die with him, he took up a position by the main road and\r\nheld it for five hours. It is said that he shot himself with his last\r\ncartridge, rather than fall into the hands of the Turks.\r\n\r\nThe natives put on their fezzes again, and a delegation of notables\r\nbearing a white flag went out to the camp of Bakhtiar Pasha to\r\nsurrender the town. On their way they were stopped by the soldiers\r\nand bashi-bazouks and made to empty their pockets. Further on more\r\nTurks, whose rapacity had been less satisfied, demanded the clothes\r\nand shoes they wore. Arriving at headquarters of the general, situated\r\non an eminence from which there was a full view of the proceedings,\r\nthe representative citizens, left with barely cloth to cover their\r\nloins, offered a protest along with the surrender. Bakhtiar had their\r\nclothes returned to them, and told them he could do nothing with ‘those\r\nbashi-bazouks’--though beside him sat Adam Aga, a notorious scoundrel\r\nof Prelip, who had brought up the largest detachment of bashi-bazouks,\r\nand with whom, subsequently, Bakhtiar is said to have shared the\r\nproceeds of the loot.\r\n\r\nThe Turks entered the town in droves ready for their work, rushing,\r\nshouting, and shooting. The bashi-bazouks knew the town, its richest\r\nstores and wealthiest houses; they had dealt with the Vlachs on market\r\nday for years. They knew that the Patriarchist church was the richest\r\nin Macedonia. The carving on the altar was particularly costly, and\r\nthere were rich silk vestments and robes, silver candlesticks and\r\nCommunion service, and fine bronze crosses. They went to this church\r\nfirst. Its doors were battered down in a mad rush, and in a few minutes\r\nit was stripped by the frenzied creatures to the very crucifixes. Then\r\na barrel of oil was emptied into it and squirted upon its walls; the\r\ntorch was applied, and the first flames in the sack of Krushevo burst\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nThe Greek church was on the market place among the shops. The Turks who\r\nwere not fortunate enough to get into the church went to work on the\r\nstores. Door after door was cut through with adzes, the shops rifled of\r\ntheir contents, and then ignited as the church had been. Two hundred\r\nand three shops and three hundred and sixty-six private houses were\r\npillaged and burned, and six hundred others were simply rifled--because\r\nthe petroleum gave out.\r\n\r\nSome of the inhabitants escaped from their homes and fled into the\r\nwoods. Turks outside the town met them and took from them any money\r\nor valuables they had, and good clothes were taken from their backs.\r\nA few pretty girls are said to have been carried off to the camps of\r\nthe soldiers. But the Turks were mostly bent on loot. The people who\r\nremained in their homes were threatened with death unless they revealed\r\nwhere they had hidden their treasure. Infants were snatched from their\r\nmothers’ breasts, held at arm’s length, and threatened with the sword.\r\n\r\nKrushevo, with its thrifty Wallachian population, was the wealthiest\r\ncity in Macedonia. It was not many hours’ ride from the railway\r\nterminus at Monastir, and, for the purpose of making this journey,\r\nmany of the Vlachs possessed private carriages. There were pack and\r\ndraught animals and cattle to the number of many thousands. The Turks\r\nappropriated these, drove off the cattle in herds, and loaded the\r\nspoils from the stores and homes in the carriages and carts, and on the\r\nbacks of the Vlachs’ pack-animals. Seven thousand animals were taken by\r\nthe Turks--and not one went back.\r\n\r\nThis work went on for forty-eight hours. The first night was\r\ndemoniacal. Three hundred houses were in flames, and dashing in\r\nand out among them were yelling fiends, firing rifles, slashing\r\nChristians who happened to be in their way, fighting among themselves,\r\nbreaking in doors, splashing oil and firing houses, loading waggons\r\nand pack-animals. Money, jewellery, silver plate, linen, furniture,\r\nbedding, clothes, carpets went away to the Turkish villages in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nVlachs are rich and thrifty, Turks indolent and poor. They are pleased\r\nwhen the Sultan issues orders to suppress giaours.\r\n\r\nKrushevo was built on rock in a slight depression in the top of a\r\nrange of mountains. The houses were constructed solidly of stone, with\r\nthick slate roofs all cut from the mountain-side. Hilmi Pasha had\r\nexplained to me that the ‘unfortunate’ conflagration was caused by the\r\nexplosion of shells, which, he argued, any civilised nation would have\r\nemployed in capturing the town. Every house in Krushevo was ignited\r\nindividually. The gates of six hundred houses which suffered only\r\npillage bore the hacks of adzes and axes. Soldiers and bashi-bazouks,\r\nholding hands--as Turks do--still lurked about with their adzes in\r\ntheir belts. On the walls, most of which still stood, stains of\r\npetroleum trailed down. I entered one house through which two cannon\r\nballs had passed. But there was not a mark of flame as a result.\r\n\r\nThe sacking of Krushevo made a deep impression in Monastir, where\r\nthe news soon arrived, and instructions came back to the Turkish\r\ncommander to secure a paper signed by all the townsfolk declaring that\r\nthe work had been done by the insurgents. A few of the inhabitants\r\nsigned from fright, but most of the Vlachs were not intimidated.\r\nThe Governor-General concocted a story to tell foreign consuls and\r\ncorrespondents.\r\n\r\nA strange fact which puzzled many was that, with the exception of the\r\nBulgarian church, no section of the Bulgarian quarter was plundered.\r\nIt was said by the Greeks--who tried by every means to incriminate\r\nthe insurgents--that the leaders of the bands bought immunity for\r\nthe Bulgarian inhabitants by a payment to Bakhtiar Pasha of the\r\nmoney they had collected from the Vlachs. But this widely circulated\r\nstatement, which went out from Athens, could hardly be true. That\r\nsuch a negotiation could have been conducted at such a moment is\r\nhardly probable. The ranks of the insurgents were largely filled by\r\nWallachians; the insurgents had lost two hundred men in resisting the\r\nTurks; it is doubtful that the leaders could have got alive to close\r\nquarters with Bakhtiar Pasha; and most doubtful of all is that the Turk\r\nwould have respected any terms made with the committajis. The reason\r\nthat the Bulgarian houses were not entered is either that the Turks\r\ndreaded dynamite or that the poorer Bulgarian quarter was not worth\r\nplundering; perhaps both these reasons applied. It was well known to\r\nthe Turks that the Bulgarians, who are small farmers, sheep raisers,\r\nand labourers, were miserably poor; while the Wallachs, who travelled\r\nas far as Salonica, were mostly merchants and comparatively well to do.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers, having captured no insurgents, made prisoners of 116\r\ninnocent Vlachs, chained them together, two by two, and marched them to\r\nMonastir, taking along a wooden cannon as evidence of their guilt. On\r\nthe road they brained five men. The surviving prisoners were at once\r\nreleased, through consular intervention, I think.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining in the woods for two days the terror-stricken people\r\nwho had escaped from the town began to return. They found bodies of\r\ntheir relatives and friends lying about the streets, Turkish dogs, I\r\nwas told, gorging upon them. The people sought to bury their dead,\r\nbut that was not generally permitted. With some exceptions the bodies\r\nwere gathered by the soldiers and thrown into shallow trenches in the\r\nstreets. But this was done with no thoroughness, and three weeks after\r\nthe recapture I saw in a dry canal, which ran through the town under\r\nmany of the houses, thigh bones and backbones, ribs, and skulls, picked\r\nclean. Many of the inhabitants had hidden in this partly covered ‘hell\r\nhole,’ and some, driven out by chills and the pangs of hunger, had been\r\nshot on emerging.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘HELL HOLE,’ KRUSHEVO.]\r\n\r\nThe drug store of the town had been sacked and burned, and the doctor\r\nwho owned it had been killed. A young and less efficient medical man\r\nwas left alone to care for 150 wounded. The Roman Catholic sisters at\r\nMonastir applied to Hilmi Pasha for permission to go to the relief of\r\nKrushevo and take medicines. But they had told foreign consuls and\r\ncorrespondents what they had seen at Armensko, and Hilmi replied, in\r\nMohamedan fashion, ‘Those who will die, will die, and those who will\r\nlive, will live.’\r\n\r\nI attempted to enter some of the Bulgarian homes at Krushevo, but they\r\nwere still tightly barred. The inmates pleaded with me to pass on lest\r\nthe Turks should come after me and punish them for telling tales. But\r\nthe Vlachs were bolder; they besought me to enter and see the havoc\r\nthe Turks had wrought, to see the wounded women, children, and infants\r\nlying on the floors, their injuries barely tended, the wounds of many\r\nmortifying, as the stench told too well. And men, women, and children\r\ndied from wounds not vital.\r\n\r\nEach evening at sundown the awful stillness of Krushevo was shocked by\r\nthree long-drawn, triumphant shouts from a thousand throats. They were\r\nTurkish cheers at evening prayer for Abdul Hamid, the Padisha.\r\n\r\nWe were mounted ready to leave Krushevo when a native woman came out\r\nof the crowd bringing a small boy. She went up to the interpreter and\r\nspoke to him in a whisper.\r\n\r\n‘She wants you to take the boy back to Monastir,’ said my man. ‘She\r\nsays no native is allowed to leave Krushevo, and she wants to get her\r\nboy to a safer place.’\r\n\r\n‘We can’t do that,’ I replied. I was apprehensive about the journey\r\nback.\r\n\r\nBut the woman wept, so I took the boy, and she kissed my hand. He\r\nwas about eight years old. He had no luggage but a loaf of heavy\r\nbread, and he wore but a single garment, a gabardine. He sat quietly\r\nbehind my saddle and did not bother me much, and towards sundown we\r\nreached Monastir safely. The horses picked their way slowly over the\r\nrough cobble stones. As we wound into a side street the grip about me\r\nloosened, and I turned to see the youngster slip down from the horse.\r\nHe waved his hand to me and ran like a hare down a narrow lane.\r\n\r\n‘That is all right,’ said the dragoman, as we went on our way to the\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nWe never saw the boy again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE LAST TRAIL\r\n\r\n\r\nLate in September, when the snows began to fall upon the Balkans, the\r\ninsurgents called a conference, and Damian Grueff, the supreme chief,\r\nand many of the high chiefs of the Internal Revolutionary Committee,\r\nmet on Bigla Dagh. About six hundred committajis were gathered with the\r\nvoivodas. A triple line of sentinels cordoned the mountain, and for ten\r\nmiles in every direction outposts watched the roads.\r\n\r\nThe fighting season was over. The revolution had not accomplished its\r\npurpose; all it had brought about was a beggarly extension of the\r\nAustro-Russian reforms. But there was no use continuing to fight. The\r\npeasants were beginning to return to their villages--or the sites of\r\nthem--and what arms they still possessed had better be taken from them\r\nand stored in safe hiding-places for another year.\r\n\r\nThe organisation was reduced to a winter status, Damian Grueff\r\nremaining in active command of some sixty bands of a thousand men in\r\nall. The other insurgents were parolled until summoned again.\r\n\r\nThe committajis had hoped that the ‘general rising’--or, rather, the\r\nsuppression which they foresaw for it--would cause the Powers of\r\nEurope to make Macedonia autonomous. They put most of their faith in\r\nthe sympathy of Great Britain, and in this they made no mistake--though\r\nGreat Britain has tried for a long time to sympathise with the Turks.\r\nAt the wanton suppression of the feeble rising it was the British\r\nGovernment that advocated the delivery of the province from Turkish\r\ncontrol. Austria and Russia, on the contrary, and especially Russia,\r\nurged upon the Turkish Government the necessity of a rapid and thorough\r\nrepression of the rising, and warned Bulgaria early and often against\r\nentering into the conflict.\r\n\r\nIt was announced during the revolution that the Russian Czar and the\r\nAustrian Emperor would meet, together with their Foreign Ministers,\r\nat Murzsteg; and to this conference the Bulgarians attached much hope\r\nuntil it was declared from Vienna and St. Petersburg that the interview\r\nof the Emperors would in no way alter their Macedonian programme.\r\n\r\nThe programme was altered, however, as a compromise with Lord\r\nLansdowne. The British Foreign Minister, with support from the\r\nGovernments of Italy and France, proposed to the Austrian and Russian\r\nForeign Ministers, while at Murzsteg, that Macedonia be placed under\r\nthe control of a governor-general independent of the Sultan and\r\nresponsible to the Powers alone. The Austro-Russian alliance objected\r\nto this, but, in spite of previous declarations to the contrary, agreed\r\nto extend their scheme of reforms.\r\n\r\nThe Murzsteg programme, as the new scheme is known, provided for\r\nthe appointment of two civil agents, one Austrian and one Russian,\r\nto ‘assist’ Hilmi Pasha; for the appointment of foreign officers to\r\nreform the Turkish gendarmerie; and for taxation, financial, and other\r\nreforms. The two most interested Powers would have employed only\r\nAustrian and Russian officers to reorganise the Turkish gendarmerie,\r\nbut Italy and Great Britain insisted on participating in this work, and\r\neach of them, as well as France, sent a contingent of five officers and\r\na chief to Turkey. Germany, in consideration of the Sultan, who opposed\r\nthis reform desperately, declined to detail a staff.\r\n\r\nThe Russian civil agents (the first was withdrawn) have both been men\r\nwith Russian ideas of government. The Austrians (the first of whom\r\ndied) have been without sufficient support from Vienna. Hilmi Pasha\r\nremains absolute governor of the Rumelian provinces, and the second\r\nAustro-Russian programme remains at this writing, April 1906, little\r\nmore effective than the first. Except in the district of Drama, where\r\nthe British officers operate, there is little change in the condition\r\nof Macedonia. Soldiers and civil officials, left unpaid, continue\r\ntheir work of plunder and extortion, murders are numerous, and minor\r\nmassacres take place from time to time; the insurgents maintain\r\ntheir organisation, skeleton bands continue to roam the country, and\r\noccasionally fights occur.\r\n\r\nDuring 1905 Lord Lansdowne again pressed for effective measures of\r\nreform. The Italian and French Governments again gave him some\r\nsupport. Towards the end of the year Austria and Russia ‘invited’ the\r\nother Powers to participate in an international naval demonstration to\r\nwrest from the Sultan financial autonomy for Macedonia. The British\r\nForeign Office at once agreed to participate, and proposed that the\r\ndemonstration should exact also effective reforms in the judicial\r\nadministration of Macedonia, but the two most interested Powers again\r\nopposed whole-hearted measures. Germany advised the Sultan to accede,\r\nbut would send no ships.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the conference on Bigla Dagh, the voivodas, with their bands,\r\nseparated, bound in different directions on various missions. Boris\r\nSarafoff, with ninety men, dropped south from Bigla Dagh around Florina\r\nto convey news of the revolution’s end to certain other bands, and\r\nto gather arms from the peasants. The band were destined ultimately\r\nto return to Bulgaria, 120 miles away; but they were doomed to cover\r\nseveral times this distance, spending thirty-four days, on the march\r\nback to the free land.\r\n\r\nThey now avoided encounters with the Turks, travelled by night and\r\nrested by day. At the limit of each revolutionary district the band\r\nwere met by a guide, who conducted them on to the next. They found the\r\nlocal organisations, disarmed the ‘irregulars,’ and secreted the rifles\r\nand munitions. They dropped almost due south, passing along the crest\r\nof the mountain range to the east of Lake Presba, which Bakhtiar\r\nPasha’s forces were then ‘driving’; but Sarafoff, with several other\r\nbands, slipped through and proceeded in safety down around Florina,\r\nthen up across the Monastir-Salonica railway, and north by a zigzag\r\ntrail past Prelip to the Vardar above Kuprili.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MACEDONIAN.]\r\n\r\nAt the side of the Vardar runs the railway from Servia to Salonica,\r\nutilising the cuts the water has made in centuries of flow through the\r\nmountains. At every mile-post along the railway was a military camp or\r\na blockhouse. Here was the first failure of the organisation.\r\n\r\nThe local guide did not appear at the appointed meeting-place, and the\r\nband waited in vain. What happened to the peasant was never known, but\r\nshortly after the appointed hour several voices were heard. Lest the\r\nparty who were approaching should be Turks, the insurgents took the\r\nprecaution to remain silent.\r\n\r\nThe voices became distinct, and the insurgents were relieved to hear\r\nthe Bulgarian tongue. One of Sarafoff’s lieutenants, named Detcheff,\r\nalso an ex-Bulgarian officer, was sent out to meet the newcomers. A\r\ncall of ‘Halt!’ was heard, and in quick succession the crack of several\r\nrifles. Detcheff did not return.\r\n\r\nThe number of the enemy was evidently small, and they took themselves\r\noff hurriedly in the direction they had come. The band were much\r\nattached to Detcheff, and hotheads among the men were for following the\r\nTurks; but Sarafoff, seeing the folly and danger of this, led them off\r\nat once towards the river, travelling fast to escape possible trackers.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult marching in the dark without a man who knew the\r\nground, and the insurgents dared not light a match to look at a map.\r\nSuddenly the band came to the edge of a yawning chasm. A stout rope\r\nwhich they carried was unrolled and slung around a tree, both ends\r\ntrailing down the precipice. Two by two, one on each line of the rope,\r\nthe men dropped down to a watercourse below. Then one end of the rope\r\nwas pulled, and the other went up around the tree, and fell. The rope\r\nhad to be saved.\r\n\r\nThe insurgents arrived at the river before morning, but did not dare\r\nto cross without a survey. They laid themselves down on an elevation\r\ncovered with a thick growth of shrub, speaking only in whispers\r\nthroughout the next day. It was a tantalising day, for every half-hour\r\na patrol of Asiatic or Albanian soldiers would pass at a languid\r\npace--and an enticing range--along the railway below. The hiding-place\r\nof the band overlooked the river and the railway for about a mile in\r\neach direction, and, with the aid of Austrian military maps, Sarafoff\r\nplanned his crossing and the route to be taken thereafter.\r\n\r\nTo the south, about half a mile away, was a camp of half a dozen\r\ntents guarding a bridge; to the north, about a quarter of a mile, was\r\nanother, of tents and brush huts. Almost immediately below the band was\r\na narrow, walled waterway which carried flood-water from the mountain,\r\ndown under the tracks into the river. The waterway was now dry.\r\n\r\nThe night train passed south about nine o’clock. Then the Turks relaxed\r\ntheir vigilance. And there was about two hours left before the moon\r\nrose. As soon as the puff of the engine had died away in the distance,\r\ntwo strong swimmers descended to the river with the rope and fastened\r\nit securely from one shore to the other. This done, they returned and\r\ninformed the chief, and one by one the men climbed down through the\r\nculvert and launched out into the stream. Arriving on the opposite\r\nbank, they scurried into the woods. Four of the men, more fastidious\r\nthan the others, took off their clothes to make the passage, and\r\nattempted to hold them, with their guns, over their heads. The Vardar\r\nis not very deep, but its current is terrific, and all four, finding\r\nthat they needed both hands to the rope, lost their clothes. This\r\nquartet arrived at the point of reassembling dressed in cartridge\r\nbelts; but they had saved these, their guns and dynamite bombs. Very\r\nlike Kipling’s warriors who ‘took Lungtungpen naked!’ The other men\r\nsuppressed their laughter at the discomfited group only because of the\r\ndangerous proximity of the camp to the north, and made up between them\r\ncostumes for the shivering four.\r\n\r\nThe last man to cross the stream loosened the rope at the other side,\r\nand two others pulled him over; and the ‘trek’ was immediately renewed.\r\n\r\nBefore day dawned, the insurgents drew up at a sheepfold on a\r\nmountain-side. The barking of the dogs woke the old shepherd, who,\r\ndiscovering the nature of his guests, roused his sheep and drove them\r\nout; and the insurgents crept in under the low brush roofs on to the\r\nwarm straw. The insurgents took two sheep and roasted them whole for\r\ntheir evening meal.\r\n\r\nOne morning, by accident, the band lay down to rest within two hundred\r\nyards of a vast camp of soldiers. At sunset, the Mohamedans offered up\r\nthe three evening cheers for their Padisha, and the insurgents uttered\r\nthree curses upon ‘his Sultanic Majesty.’\r\n\r\nIt had come to be known to the Turks that Sarafoff was making his way\r\nto the Bulgarian border; a reward was offered for his head, and cavalry\r\npatrols were sent out to intercept him. But it was not difficult to\r\nelude these, for the cavalry could not leave the roads; and it broke\r\nthe monotony of the days in hiding to watch the patrols pass on the\r\nhighways below.\r\n\r\nIt is generally with the bands to fight or not to fight; but sometimes\r\nthey are surprised by the Turks. Sarafoff and his band succeeded in\r\neluding the troops until they arrived in the neighbourhood of a little\r\ntown named Bouff, where, being worn out with a week’s hard marching,\r\nthey elected to rest for thirty-six hours.\r\n\r\nThe first day was uneventful, but as the second began to dawn on the\r\nheights one of the pickets, a boy of fourteen, rushed into camp with\r\nthe news that the Turks were entering the little valley in which the\r\ninsurgents were camped. The boy had hardly delivered this news when a\r\npicket from the summit of the ridge to the east rushed in breathless,\r\nand announced that soldiers were climbing the slope on his side. And\r\nfrom various other points soon came sentries with similar information.\r\n\r\nThe insurgents were about their chief in an instant to hear his\r\ncommand. Sarafoff had studied the lie of the land overnight, and it\r\nrequired but a moment for him to decide upon his plan of battle.\r\n\r\nThe band were occupying the base of a narrow ‘dip,’ one end of which\r\nwas closed by an insurmountable wall of sheer stone, and the other\r\nnow blocked by probably two hundred Turkish soldiers. Another body of\r\nTurks, perhaps three hundred strong, were already coming over one of\r\nthe two mountain crests. The other slope--the only way of escape open\r\nto the band--was so steep as to be impossible of ascent except by aid\r\nof the low bush that covered it. The surprise was complete, and the\r\ntrap was tight.\r\n\r\nThere was a huge rock, lodged half-way up the open mountain-side,\r\nwhich would offer some protection. Sarafoff picked eight men from his\r\nband and started for this boulder, leaving the others, in charge of a\r\nlieutenant, to lie low in the bushes until he and his party attained\r\nthe eminence. By climbing fast and taking the shelter of the shrubs,\r\nthe nine men got to the rock with the loss of but one of their number.\r\nNot until then did they return the fire of the Turks, now descending\r\nthe opposite slope. As soon as the main body of the band heard the fire\r\nof their comrades, they scattered, and started to pick their way up\r\naround the rock to the summit of the peak. It took them two hours to\r\nmake the ascent, and during this time some of the Turks wound around\r\nto the right of Sarafoff’s position on the boulder, and a few got far\r\nabove him to his left. Between these two raking fires the place would\r\nhave been untenable had not the insurgents above kept these parties\r\nof Turks replenishing their numbers every minute. When the Turks\r\nsucceeded in picking off three more of Sarafoff’s men, leaving him now\r\nbut four--though all of the other insurgents had not yet reached the\r\npoint of the peak--he vacated the boulder. The four men scattered, as\r\nthe others had done, and scurried up the ascent. All five succeeded\r\nin gaining the little fort at the top, and, without waiting to take\r\nbreath, dropped beside the main body, and took up the fusillade which\r\nthese had already begun.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for Sarafoff, the band had been surrounded. The heights\r\nwere a mass of broken boulders which afforded protection to their\r\nenemies as well as to the insurgents. Only one spot, to the south,\r\nwas smooth and bare, and this space the Turkish commander took the\r\nprecaution not to occupy, for two reasons. First, his men would have\r\nbeen picked off as fast as they filled it, and the sacrifice evidently\r\ndid not appear to him to be necessary; secondly, the opening acted as\r\na bait for the hard-pressed insurgents, tempting them into the passage,\r\non each side of which soldiers were massed in strong force. Sarafoff\r\nsurmised that this was a trap, and, while realising the hopelessness of\r\nhis position, chose to fight it out where the lives of the band would\r\ncost the Turks dearest.\r\n\r\nUntil ten o’clock the Turks, certain of success, made no attempt\r\nto storm the position. They had taken up secure places behind\r\nrocks, and keeping up a desultory firing, they awaited the arrival\r\nof reinforcements, for which they had sent to a near-by town. The\r\nreinforcements came--for the sake of speed, in the shape of cavalry\r\nand artillery. The cavalry could not get into action because of the\r\nroughness of the ground, and was deployed as a patrol to prevent any\r\nother band which might be in the neighbourhood from coming to the\r\nrelief of Sarafoff. The artillery could not be brought into close\r\nquarters for the same reason, but it was posted on an eminence quite\r\nwithin range.\r\n\r\nShortly before noon the cannon opened fire. The target was rather small\r\nand decidedly indefinite, and for nearly an hour the shells went over\r\nor fell short of the insurgent position; but when the artillerymen\r\nfinally succeeded in getting the range, the flying splinters of shell\r\nand stone meant certain death to anyone who dared to put his head\r\nabove the rocks. The insurgent fire slackened under this hail, and\r\nthe Turkish commander, evidently supposing that the band had been\r\nmaterially reduced in number, ordered an assault from all sides. The\r\ncannon fire was discontinued for fear of working slaughter among the\r\ncharging soldiers, and the Turks came forward to the attack, dodging\r\nfrom rock to rock, and closing in on all sides--except in the space\r\npurposely left open. Sarafoff ordered half of his men to lay down their\r\nguns and prepare their dynamite, and cautioned the others to make\r\nevery rifle shot strike its mark. He himself, expecting a hand-to-hand\r\nencounter at the last, laid aside his gun, drew his sword, and strapped\r\nit to his hand. The riflemen did their work well. Turks fell on every\r\nside; but on they came! When the foremost of them got to within twenty\r\nyards of the little fort, the insurgents began to throw their bombs.\r\nThe Turks have a terror of the dynamite bomb, and these ‘infernal\r\nmachines’ checked their advance for a time. At a lull in the din there\r\nwere repeated shouts from the Turks in Bulgarian (which many of them\r\nspeak), ‘Lay down your arms and surrender, Sarafoff! the Padisha is\r\ngood, and will surely pardon you!’ But the leader had no thought of\r\nallowing himself and his men to fall alive into the hands of the Turks;\r\nhis knowledge of how they respect promises to ‘infidels’ precluded any\r\nidea of his accepting the tempting offer.\r\n\r\nIt was now after one o’clock. If the band could hold out until\r\nnightfall, there was a slight chance for some of them to cut their way\r\nthrough the Turkish lines with bombs; but the Turks would certainly\r\nmake any sacrifice to storm the position before dark--the great\r\nSarafoff was cordoned and would not have another opportunity to escape.\r\n\r\nThe day was inclement, and thick, black clouds hung over many of the\r\nmountains. Perhaps the Turks longed for one of these to break from its\r\nhold on another peak, and float over to this, for they abated their\r\nfire when a dense, all-enveloping wreath followed this course. Sarafoff\r\njudged that they would storm his shelter in the protecting mist, and\r\nlaid his plans accordingly. At the moment that the blackness was\r\ncomplete, the insurgents began again to cast their dynamite, and kept a\r\nzone about their little fortress hot with exploding shells. The Turks\r\nwaited until this cannonade should conclude; but while they waited,\r\nall the insurgents dispersed except Sarafoff and fifteen of his men,\r\nand, each acting for himself, dashed for the open space left by the\r\nTurks with such precision. A pistol was loaded for each of the wounded\r\nmen who could not escape, in order that they might blow out their own\r\nbrains; and then, lighting the last half-dozen bombs with long fuses,\r\nto hold off the Turks yet a few minutes, Sarafoff gave to the men who\r\nhad stayed with him the order to fix bayonets and follow those who had\r\ngone before.\r\n\r\nWhen night fell, less than fifty men of the original ninety gathered\r\ntogether in the dense forest on the far side of the mountain appointed\r\nas the place of meeting. They were blackened from smoke, and down some\r\nof the drawn and haggard faces streaks of blood were trickling. Their\r\nthroats were parched, and they were famished with hunger, and a few of\r\nthem were off their heads with fatigue and excitement, and had to be\r\ngagged.\r\n\r\nThey all lay as quiet as mice throughout the night, and the next day\r\ntwo of the most innocent-looking members of the band, stripped of their\r\ninsurgent paraphernalia, and in the garb of ordinary peasants, went\r\ndown into Bouff for food.\r\n\r\nWhen they got to the village, they found it had been visited with the\r\nvengeance of the Turks. On returning to garrison, the Turkish soldiers\r\npassed through Bouff and murdered a few old men and defenceless women\r\nwhom they found there (the other inhabitants being still in the\r\nmountains). They fired many of the houses and pillaged the town, and\r\nthere was very little of anything valuable left. There was much coarse,\r\nuncooked flour scattered about, and some Indian corn, and of these\r\ncommodities the two insurgents collected as much as they could carry\r\nand returned to their comrades.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall of the day after the fight the band resumed their march.\r\nThe insurgents filed out of the woods in a long, single line, the local\r\nguide leading, and made their way to the edge of the next revolutionary\r\ndistrict, where the chief thereof was awaiting them. They replenished\r\ntheir spent supply of ammunition from the secret stores of the\r\nvillagers in the mountains, and proceeded on their way. Their course\r\nnow was to the north-east, and they made tracks for their destination\r\nas straight as the Turkish camps and patrols would permit, arriving\r\nwithout further adventure at the friendly frontier.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish guard would certainly be on the watch for the band, so the\r\nleader decided to cross the border close to one of the smaller posts,\r\nwhere, he judged, the patrols would be less active, not expecting such\r\naudacity. He selected a passing place within earshot of a blockhouse,\r\nwhich could be seen plainly in the moonlight. A sentinel sat in Turkish\r\nfashion before the door, wailing a doleful dirge through his nose,\r\na way Turkish sentinels have. To the time of the Turk’s music the\r\ninsurgent band filed over the border, guns loaded and cocked, bayonets\r\nfixed, and arrived in Kustendil, whence to Sofia their march was a\r\ntriumphant procession.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI received orders late one evening to proceed at once to Sofia\r\nand prepare to accompany the Bulgarian army, which was mobilising\r\non the Turkish frontier. I was glad to get this order, and obeyed\r\ninstructions, though I knew there would be no war. The British Consul\r\nthen secured a _passavant_ for me, by which I was described as a man of\r\na round figure and black moustaches. In a civilised country my identity\r\nwould have been challenged, but the instrument passed me over the\r\nTurkish border.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Sofia were crowded with committajis, in brown uniforms,\r\nfur caps, white woollen leggings, and sandals. They were mostly members\r\nof General Tzoncheff’s committee who had fought along the Struma.\r\nLater, bands from Grueff’s organisation began to arrive. There were\r\nseveral leaders who had been prominent in the revolution. I sought\r\nthe count again, and, with my old interpreter, spent many hours among\r\nthe insurgents. They were generally to be found at the cheaper cafés,\r\nsitting over the rough tables recounting their adventures. It was at a\r\ncafé that I got the story of Sarafoff’s Trail.\r\n\r\nThese soldiers of fortune had become indifferent to everything but\r\nrevolution. They did not care how they looked or what they did, and a\r\nworse gang of beggars I never saw. Pride had flown. Work! Not they.\r\nThey are hunters of men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMITTAJIS OFF DUTY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MACEDONIAN COMMITTEES\r\n\r\nThe following information regarding the Macedonian Committees was\r\ncontained in a letter from General Tzoncheff to me. There are some\r\neliminations, but no alterations in the text.--F. M.\r\n\r\n‘The beginning of the revolutionary movement goes back to the years\r\n1893-94, but its real, substantial work began from 1895. At this\r\ntime there were already two organisations--one in Macedonia, which\r\nwas revolutionary; the other in Bulgaria, which was legal, open\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n‘By the very nature of things the legal organisation in Bulgaria\r\nbecame the representative of the Macedonian cause before Europe. In\r\naccordance with the revolutionary organisation, the legal one worked up\r\nthe well-known principles for an autonomy, which were proclaimed by a\r\nmemorandum to the Powers and to the Press in 1896.\r\n\r\n‘The revolutionary work was carried on by the two organisations in\r\nharmony until the year 1901, each organisation acting in its sphere\r\nfor the same object. Though separated in their way of action, the two\r\norganisations were, in fact, one and the same. The members of the one\r\npassed into the other, as the needs and the circumstances dictated.\r\nAll the Macedonian leaders have belonged and participated to the two\r\norganisations. Thus Deltcheff from 1899 to 1901 worked conjointly and\r\nsigned the resolutions of the High Macedonian Committee under the\r\npresidency of Boris Sarafoff, who was chosen by us.\r\n\r\n‘In 1901 the harmony was destroyed. Sarafoff and the other members\r\nof the committee, including Deltcheff, encouraged by the extreme\r\npopularity of the cause, gave a revolutionary impulse to the legal\r\norganisation in Bulgaria by acts which were very compromising. The\r\nmurder of the Rumanian professor, Michailyano, in Bucharest, and other\r\ndeeds brought Bulgaria to the verge of a war with Rumania. The public\r\nopinion in the principality, in the Balkan States, and in Europe was\r\nexcited. We asked Sarafoff and the other members of the committee to\r\nretire, and thus to save the situation. But Sarafoff could not at that\r\ntime realise how grave the situation was, and refused to quit the\r\ncommittee. Several intrigues were invented with the object to represent\r\nthe split as of a character of fundamental principal differences. New\r\nelements, chiefly the extremists or the anarchical current, supported\r\nSarafoff. The Bulgarian Government, under the pressure of the European\r\ndiplomacy, especially of the Russian, gave its full support to the\r\ndisunion in the organisation.\r\n\r\n‘The union between the different revolutionary currents brought\r\nabout during the last insurrection was again broken up. Now we\r\nhave three revolutionary currents--ours, Damian Groueff’s, and the\r\nso-called anarchical current at the head of which stand B. Sarafoff,\r\nSandansky, and others. With the current of Damian Groueff we have\r\nnot any fundamental differences, but much with the anarchical. This\r\nlast current is not at all a disciplined organisation; its members\r\nact nearly independently. Some of them--for instance, Sandansky and\r\nTchernopeeff--during the last two years have made deeds in Macedonia\r\nwhich have brought great calamities on the population and have\r\nalienated the sympathies of the civilised world. Their aim is to throw\r\nterror and anarchy in the country and make life impossible for the\r\ninhabitants. Lacking discipline and well-defined objects, their members\r\noften go to extremes, which are very injurious to the cause of the\r\nMacedonians.\r\n\r\n‘During the last months efforts were made for an understanding between\r\nus and Groueff. The foundations for the understanding are even laid\r\ndown. If these efforts succeed fully, we hope then to have a strong\r\nrevolutionary organisation which will be able to put down all the\r\npernicious and demoralising elements in the Macedonian movement\r\nand use all its power to attain the object and the desire of the\r\nMacedonians--establishment in the country (of) a civilised government\r\nand administration, which will open to its inhabitants a free field for\r\nprogress, civilisation, and economical prosperity.\r\n\r\n‘The immediate object is not and will not be an insurrection. In the\r\nfirst place the present political situation in Europe is unfavourable\r\nfor such an action; and in the second place our interest dictates\r\nthat time and freedom should be given to the Powers to fulfil their\r\npromise for a good government, and, if they fail, that the Christian\r\nworld should see that this failure is not due to the Macedonians, but\r\nto the ineffective measures of the diplomacy. And then to tighten the\r\norganisation and to give a strong impulse to the movement, so as to be\r\nready for another struggle, when the political situation permits and if\r\nthe reforms fail.’\r\n\r\n\r\n  PRINTED BY\r\n  SPOTTISWOODE AND CO.
