Clark, Edinburgh._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the three discourses in this volume, the second was originally given\r\nas the Rede Lecture at Cambridge, was recast for delivery in America,\r\nand is reprinted here as so recast. The first discourse, that on\r\n‘Numbers,’ was originally given in New York. It was afterwards published\r\nin the _Nineteenth Century_, and I have to thank Mr. Knowles for kindly\r\npermitting me to reprint it now. The third discourse, that on ‘Emerson,’\r\nwas originally given in Emerson’s ‘own delightful town,’ Boston.\r\n\r\nI am glad of every opportunity of thanking my American audiences for the\r\nunfailing attention and kindness with which they listened to a speaker\r\nwho did not flatter them, who would have flattered them ill, but who yet\r\nfelt, and in fact expressed, more esteem and admiration than his words\r\nwere sometimes, at a hasty first hearing, supposed to convey. I cannot\r\nthink that what I have said of Emerson will finally be accounted scant\r\npraise, although praise universal and unmixed it certainly is not. What\r\nhigh esteem I feel for the suitableness and easy play of American\r\ninstitutions I have had occasion, since my return home, to say publicly\r\nand emphatically. But nothing in the discourse on ‘Numbers’ was at\r\nvariance with this high esteem, although a caution, certainly, was\r\nsuggested. But then some caution or other, to be drawn from the\r\ninexhaustibly fruitful truth that moral causes govern the standing and\r\nthe falling of States, who is there that can be said not to need?\r\n\r\nAll need it, we in this country need it, as indeed in the discourse on\r\n‘Numbers’ I have by an express instance shown. Yet as regards us in this\r\ncountry at the present moment, I am tempted, I confess, to resort to the\r\ngreat truth in question, not for caution so much as for consolation. Our\r\npolitics are ‘battles of the kites and the crows,’ of the Barbarians and\r\nthe Philistines; each combatant striving to affirm himself still, while\r\nall the vital needs and instincts of our national growth demand, not\r\nthat either of the combatants should be enabled to affirm himself, but\r\nthat each should be transformed. Our aristocratical class, the\r\nBarbarians, have no perception of the real wants of the community at\r\nhome. Our middle classes, the great Philistine power, have no perception\r\nof our real relations to the world abroad, no clue, apparently, for\r\nguidance, where-ever that attractive and ever-victorious rhetorician,\r\nwho is the Minister of their choice, may take them, except the formula\r\nof that submissive animal which carried the prophet Balaam. Our affairs\r\nare in the condition which, from such parties to our politics, might be\r\nexpected. Yet amid all the difficulties and mortifications which beset\r\nus, with the Barbarians impossible, with the Philistines determining our\r\npresent course, with our rising politicians seeking only that the mind\r\nof the Populace, when the Populace arrives at power, may be found in\r\nharmony with the mind of Mr. Carvell Williams, which they flatter\r\nthemselves they have fathomed; with the House of Lords a danger, and the\r\nHouse of Commons a scandal, and the general direction of affairs\r\ninfelicitous as we see it,—one consolation remains to us, and that no\r\nslight or unworthy one. Infelicitous the general direction of our\r\naffairs may be; but the individual Englishman, whenever and wherever\r\ncalled upon to do his duty, does it almost invariably with the old\r\nenergy, courage, virtue. And this is what we gain by having had, as a\r\npeople, in the ground of our being, a firm faith in conduct; by having\r\nbelieved, more steadfastly and fervently than most, this great law that\r\nmoral causes govern the standing and the falling of men and nations. The\r\nlaw gradually widens, indeed, so as to include light as well as honesty\r\nand energy; to make light, also, a moral cause. Unless we are\r\ntransformed we cannot finally stand, and without more light we cannot be\r\ntransformed. But in the trying hours through which before our\r\ntransformation we have to pass, it may well console us to rest our\r\nthoughts upon our life’s law even as we have hitherto known it, and upon\r\nall which even in our present imperfect acception of it it has done for\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      PAGE\r\n\r\n  Numbers; or, The Majority and the Remnant              1\r\n\r\n  Literature and Science                                72\r\n\r\n  Emerson                                              138\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  NUMBERS;\r\n  OR,\r\n  THE MAJORITY AND THE REMNANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a characteristic saying of Dr. Johnson: ‘Patriotism is the last\r\nrefuge of a scoundrel.’ The saying is cynical, many will even call it\r\nbrutal; yet it has in it something of plain, robust sense and truth. We\r\ndo often see men passing themselves off as patriots who are in truth\r\nscoundrels; we meet with talk and proceedings laying claim to\r\npatriotism, which are these gentlemen’s last refuge. We may all of us\r\nagree in praying to be delivered from patriots and patriotism of this\r\nsort. Short of such, there is undoubtedly, sheltering itself under the\r\nfine name of patriotism, a good deal of self-flattery and self-delusion\r\nwhich is mischievous. ‘Things are what they are, and the consequences of\r\nthem will be what they will be; why, then, should we desire to be\r\ndeceived?’ In that uncompromising sentence of Bishop Butler’s is surely\r\nthe right and salutary maxim for both individuals and nations.\r\n\r\nYet there is an honourable patriotism which we should satisfy if we can,\r\nand should seek to have on our side. At home I have said so much of the\r\ncharacters of our society and the prospects of our civilisation, that I\r\ncan hardly escape the like topic elsewhere. Speaking in America, I\r\ncannot well avoid saying something about the prospects of society in the\r\nUnited States. It is a topic where one is apt to touch people’s\r\npatriotic feelings. No one will accuse me of having flattered the\r\npatriotism of that great country of English people on the other side of\r\nthe Atlantic, amongst whom I was born. Here, so many miles from home, I\r\nbegin to reflect with tender contrition, that perhaps I have not,—I\r\nwill not say flattered the patriotism of my own countrymen enough, but\r\nregarded it enough. Perhaps that is one reason why I have produced so\r\nvery little effect upon them. It was a fault of youth and inexperience.\r\nBut it would be unpardonable to come in advanced life and repeat the\r\nsame error here. You will not expect impossibilities of me. You will not\r\nexpect me to say that things are not what, in my judgment, they are, and\r\nthat the consequences of them will not be what they will be. I should\r\nmake nothing of it; I should be a too palpable failure. But I confess\r\nthat I should be glad if in what I say here I could engage American\r\npatriotism on my side, instead of rousing it against me. And it so\r\nhappens that the paramount thoughts which your great country raises in\r\nmy mind are really and truly of a kind to please, I think, any true\r\nAmerican patriot, rather than to offend him.\r\n\r\nThe vast scale of things here, the extent of your country, your numbers,\r\nthe rapidity of your increase, strike the imagination, and are a common\r\ntopic for admiring remark. Our great orator, Mr. Bright, is never weary\r\nof telling us how many acres of land you have at your disposal, how many\r\nbushels of grain you produce, how many millions you are, how many more\r\nmillions you will be presently, and what a capital thing this is for\r\nyou. Now, though I do not always agree with Mr. Bright, I find myself\r\nagreeing with him here. I think your numbers afford a very real and\r\nimportant ground for satisfaction.\r\n\r\nNot that your great numbers, or indeed great numbers of men anywhere,\r\nare likely to be all good, or even to have the majority good. ‘The\r\nmajority are bad,’ said one of the wise men of Greece; but he was a\r\npagan. Much to the same effect, however, is the famous sentence of the\r\nNew Testament: ‘Many are called, few chosen,’ This appears a hard\r\nsaying; frequent are the endeavours to elude it, to attenuate its\r\nseverity. But turn it how you will, manipulate it as you will, the few,\r\nas Cardinal Newman well says, can never mean the many. Perhaps you will\r\nsay that the majority _is_, sometimes, good; that its impulses are good\r\ngenerally, and its action is good occasionally. Yes, but it lacks\r\nprinciple, it lacks persistence; if to-day its good impulses prevail,\r\nthey succumb to-morrow; sometimes it goes right, but it is very apt to\r\ngo wrong. Even a popular orator, or a popular journalist, will hardly\r\nsay that the multitude may be trusted to have its judgment generally\r\njust, and its action generally virtuous. It may be better, it is better,\r\nthat the body of the people, with all its faults, should act for itself,\r\nand control its own affairs, than that it should be set aside as\r\nignorant and incapable, and have its affairs managed for it by a\r\nso-called superior class, possessing property and intelligence. Property\r\nand intelligence cannot be trusted to show a sound majority themselves;\r\nthe exercise of power by the people tends to educate the people. But\r\nstill, the world being what it is, we must surely expect the aims and\r\ndoings of the majority of men to be at present very faulty, and this in\r\na numerous community no less than in a small one. So much we must\r\ncertainly, I think, concede to the sages and to the saints.\r\n\r\nSages and saints are apt to be severe, it is true; apt to take a gloomy\r\nview of the society in which they live, and to prognosticate evil to it.\r\nBut then it must be added that their prognostications are very apt to\r\nturn out right. Plato’s account of the most gifted and brilliant\r\ncommunity of the ancient world, of that Athens of his to which we all\r\nowe so much, is despondent enough. ‘There is but a very small remnant,’\r\nhe says, ‘of honest followers of wisdom, and they who are of these few,\r\nand who have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession is wisdom, and\r\nwho can fully see, moreover, the madness of the multitude, and that\r\nthere is no one, we may say, whose action in public matters is sound,\r\nand no ally for whosoever would help the just, what,’ asks Plato, ‘are\r\nthey to do? They may be compared,’ says Plato, ‘to a man who has fallen\r\namong wild beasts; he will not be one of them, but he is too unaided to\r\nmake head against them; and before he can do any good to society or his\r\nfriends, he will be overwhelmed and perish uselessly. When he considers\r\nthis, he will resolve to keep still, and to mind his own business; as it\r\nwere standing aside under a wall in a storm of dust and hurricane of\r\ndriving wind; and he will endure to behold the rest filled with\r\niniquity, if only he himself may live his life clear of injustice and of\r\nimpiety, and depart, when his time comes, in mild and gracious mood,\r\nwith fair hope.’\r\n\r\nPlato’s picture here of democratic Athens is certainly gloomy enough. We\r\nmay be sure the mass of his contemporaries would have pronounced it to\r\nbe monstrously overcharged. We ourselves, if we had been living then,\r\nshould most of us have by no means seen things as Plato saw them. No, if\r\nwe had seen Athens even nearer its end than when Plato wrote the strong\r\nwords which I have been quoting, Athens in the very last days of Plato’s\r\nlife, we should most of us probably have considered that things were not\r\ngoing badly with Athens. There is a long sixteen years’\r\nadministration,—the administration of Eubulus,—which fills the last\r\nyears of Plato’s life, and the middle years of the fourth century before\r\nChrist. A temperate German historian thus describes Athens during this\r\nministry of Eubulus: ‘The grandeur and loftiness of Attic democracy had\r\nvanished, while all the pernicious germs contained in it were fully\r\ndeveloped. A life of comfort and a craving for amusement were encouraged\r\nin every way, and the interest of the citizens was withdrawn from\r\nserious things. Conversation became more and more superficial and\r\nfrivolous. Famous courtesans formed the chief topic of talk; the new\r\ninventions of Thearion, the leading pastry-cook in Athens, were hailed\r\nwith loud applause; and the witty sayings which had been uttered in gay\r\ncircles were repeated about town as matters of prime importance.’\r\n\r\nNo doubt, if we had been living then to witness this, we should from\r\ntime to time have shaken our heads gravely, and said how sad it all was.\r\nBut most of us would not, I think, have been very seriously disquieted\r\nby it. On the other hand, we should have found many things in the Athens\r\nof Eubulus to gratify us. ‘The democrats,’ says the same historian whom\r\nI have just quoted, ‘saw in Eubulus one of their own set at the head of\r\naffairs;’ and I suppose no good democrat would see that without\r\npleasure. Moreover, Eubulus was of popular character. In one respect he\r\nseems to have resembled your own ‘heathen Chinee;’ he had ‘guileless\r\nways,’ says our historian, ‘in which the citizens took pleasure.’ He was\r\nalso a good speaker, a thorough man of business; and, above all, he was\r\nvery skilful in matters of finance. His administration was both popular\r\nand prosperous. We should certainly have said, most of us, if we had\r\nencountered somebody announcing his resolve to stand aside under a wall\r\nduring such an administration, that he was a goose for his pains; and if\r\nhe had called it ‘a falling among wild beasts’ to have to live with his\r\nfellow-citizens who had confidence in Eubulus, their country, and\r\nthemselves, we should have esteemed him very impertinent.\r\n\r\nYes;—and yet at the close of that administration of Eubulus came the\r\ncollapse, and the end of Athens as an independent State. And it was to\r\nthe fault of Athens herself that the collapse was owing. Plato was right\r\nafter all; the majority were bad, and the remnant were impotent.\r\n\r\nSo fared it with that famous Athenian State, with the brilliant people\r\nof art and intellect. Now let us turn to the people of religion. We have\r\nheard Plato speaking of the very small remnant which honestly sought\r\nwisdom. _The remnant!_—it is the word of the Hebrew prophets also, and\r\nespecially is it the word of the greatest of them all, Isaiah. Not used\r\nwith the despondency of Plato, used with far other power informing it,\r\nand with a far other future awaiting it, filled with fire, filled with\r\nhope, filled with faith, filled with joy, this term itself, _the\r\nremnant_, is yet Isaiah’s term as well as Plato’s. The texts are\r\nfamiliar to all Christendom. ‘Though thy people Israel be as the sand of\r\nthe sea, only a remnant of them shall return.’ Even this remnant, a\r\ntenth of the whole, if so it may be, shall have to come back into the\r\npurging fire, and be again cleared and further reduced there. But\r\nnevertheless, ‘as a terebinth tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in\r\nthem, though they be cut down, so the stock of that burned tenth shall\r\nbe a holy seed.’\r\n\r\nYes, the small remnant should be a holy seed; but the great majority, as\r\nin democratic Athens, so in the kingdoms of the Hebrew nation, were\r\nunsound, and their State was doomed. This was Isaiah’s point. The actual\r\ncommonwealth of the ‘drunkards’ and the ‘blind,’ as he calls them, in\r\nIsrael and Judah, of the dissolute grandees and gross and foolish common\r\npeople, of the great majority, must perish; its perishing was the\r\nnecessary stage towards a happier future. And Isaiah was right, as Plato\r\nwas right. No doubt to most of us, if we had been there to see it, the\r\nkingdom of Ephraim or of Judah, the society of Samaria and Jerusalem,\r\nwould have seemed to contain a great deal else besides dissolute\r\ngrandees and foolish common people. No doubt we should have thought\r\nparts of their policy serious, and some of their alliances promising. No\r\ndoubt, when we read the Hebrew prophets now, with the larger and more\r\npatient temper of a different race and an augmented experience, we often\r\nfeel the blame and invective to be too absolute. Nevertheless, as to his\r\ngrand point, Isaiah, I say, was right. The majority in the Jewish State,\r\nwhatever they might think or say, whatever their guides and flatterers\r\nmight think or say, the majority were unsound, and their unsoundness\r\nmust be their ruin.\r\n\r\nIsaiah, however, does not make his remnant confine itself, like Plato’s,\r\nto standing aside under a wall during this life and then departing in\r\nmild temper and good hope when the time for departure comes; Isaiah’s\r\nremnant saves the State. Undoubtedly he means to represent it as doing\r\nso. Undoubtedly he imagines his Prince of the house of David who is to\r\nbe born within a year’s time, his royal and victorious Immanuel, he\r\nimagines him witnessing as a child the chastisement of Ephraim and the\r\nextirpation of the bad majority there; then witnessing as a youth the\r\nchastisement of Judah and the extirpation of the bad majority there\r\nalso; but finally, in mature life, reigning over a State renewed,\r\npreserved, and enlarged, a greater and happier kingdom of the chosen\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly Isaiah conceives his remnant in this wise; undoubtedly he\r\nimagined for it a part which, in strict truth, it did not play, and\r\ncould not play. So manifest was the non-fulfilment of his prophecy,\r\ntaken strictly, that ardent souls feeding upon his words had to wrest\r\nthem from their natural meaning, and to say that Isaiah directly meant\r\nsomething which he did not directly mean. Isaiah, like Plato, with\r\ninspired insight foresaw that the world before his eyes, the world of\r\nactual life, the State and city of the unsound majority, could not\r\nstand. Unlike Plato, Isaiah announced with faith and joy a leader and a\r\nremnant certain to supersede them. But he put the leader’s coming, and\r\nhe put the success of the leader’s and the remnant’s work, far, far too\r\nsoon; and his conception, in this respect, is fantastic. Plato betook\r\nhimself for the bringing in of righteousness to a visionary republic in\r\nthe clouds; Isaiah,—and it is the immortal glory of him and of his race\r\nto have done so,—brought it in upon earth. But Immanuel and his reign,\r\nfor the eighth century before Christ, were fantastic. For the kingdom of\r\nJudah they were fantastic. Immanuel and the remnant could not come to\r\nreign under the conditions there and then offered to them; the thing was\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the impossibility is quite simple. The scale of things, in\r\npetty States like Judah and Athens, is too small; the numbers are too\r\nscanty. Admit that for the world, as we hitherto know it, what the\r\nphilosophers and prophets say is true: that the majority are unsound.\r\nEven in communities with exceptional gifts, even in the Jewish State,\r\nthe Athenian State, the majority are unsound. But there is ‘the\r\nremnant.’ Now the important thing, as regards States such as Judah and\r\nAthens, is not that the remnant bears but a small proportion to the\r\nmajority; the remnant always bears a small proportion to the majority.\r\nThe grave things for States like Judah and Athens is, that the remnant\r\nmust in positive bulk be so small, and therefore so powerless for\r\nreform. To be a voice outside the State, speaking to mankind or to the\r\nfuture, perhaps shaking the actual State to pieces in doing so, one man\r\nwill suffice. But to reform the State in order to save it, to preserve\r\nit by changing it, a body of workers is needed as well as a leader;—a\r\nconsiderable body of workers, placed at many points, and operating in\r\nmany directions. This considerable body of workers for good is what is\r\nwanting in petty States such as were Athens and Judah. It is said that\r\nthe Athenian State had in all but 350,000 inhabitants. It is calculated\r\nthat the population of the kingdom of Judah did not exceed a million and\r\na quarter. The scale of things, I say, is here too small, the numbers\r\nare too scanty, to give us a remnant capable of saving and perpetuating\r\nthe community. The remnant, in these cases, may influence the world and\r\nthe future, may transcend the State and survive it; but it cannot\r\npossibly transform the State and perpetuate the State: for such a work\r\nit is numerically too feeble.\r\n\r\nPlato saw the impossibility. Isaiah refused to accept it, but facts were\r\ntoo strong for him. The Jewish State could not be renewed and saved, and\r\nhe was wrong in thinking that it could. And therefore I call his grand\r\npoint this other, where he was altogether right: that the actual world\r\nof the unsound majority, though it fancied itself solid, and though most\r\nmen might call it solid, could not stand. Let us read him again and\r\nagain, until we fix in our minds this true conviction of his, to edify\r\nus whenever we see such a world existing: his indestructible conviction\r\nthat such a world, with its prosperities, idolatries, oppression,\r\nluxury, pleasures, drunkards, careless women, governing classes, systems\r\nof policy, strong alliances, shall come to nought and pass away; that\r\nnothing can save it. Let us do homage, also, to his indestructible\r\nconviction that States are saved by their righteous remnant, however\r\nclearly we may at the same time recognise that his own building on this\r\nconviction was premature.\r\n\r\nThat, however, matters to us little. For how different is the scale of\r\nthings in the modern States to which we belong, how far greater are the\r\nnumbers! It is impossible to overrate the importance of the new element\r\nintroduced into our calculations by increasing the size of the remnant.\r\nAnd in our great modern States, where the scale of things is so large,\r\nit does seem as if the remnant might be so increased as to become an\r\nactual power, even though the majority be unsound. Then the lover of\r\nwisdom may come out from under his wall, the lover of goodness will not\r\nbe alone among the wild beasts. To enable the remnant to succeed, a\r\nlarge strengthening of its numbers is everything.\r\n\r\nHere is good hope for us, not only, as for Plato’s recluse, in departing\r\nthis life, but while we live and work in it. Only, before we dwell too\r\nmuch on this hope, it is advisable to make sure that we have earned the\r\nright to entertain it. We have earned the right to entertain it, only\r\nwhen we are at one with the philosophers and prophets in their\r\nconviction respecting the world which now is, the world of the unsound\r\nmajority; when we feel what they mean, and when we go thoroughly along\r\nwith them in it. Most of us, as I have said already, would by no means\r\nhave been with them when they were here in life, and most of us are not\r\nreally with them now. What is saving? Our institutions, says an\r\nAmerican; the British Constitution, says an Englishman; the civilising\r\nmission of France, says a Frenchman. But Plato and the sages, when they\r\nare asked what is saving, answer: ‘To love righteousness, and to be\r\nconvinced of the unprofitableness of iniquity.’ And Isaiah and the\r\nprophets, when they are asked the same question, answer to just the same\r\neffect: that what is saving is to ‘order one’s conversation right’; to\r\n‘cease to do evil’; to ‘delight in the law of the Eternal’; and to ‘make\r\none’s study in it all day long.’\r\n\r\nThe worst of it is, that this loving of righteousness and this\r\ndelighting in the law of the Eternal sound rather vague to us. Not that\r\nthey are vague really; indeed, they are less vague than American\r\ninstitutions, or the British Constitution, or the civilising mission of\r\nFrance. But the phrases sound vague because of the quantity of matters\r\nthey cover. The thing is to have a brief but adequate enumeration of\r\nthese matters. The New Testament tells us how righteousness is composed.\r\nIn England and America we have been brought up in familiarity with the\r\nNew Testament. And so, before Mr. Bradlaugh on our side of the water,\r\nand the Congress of American Freethinkers on yours, banish it from our\r\neducation and memory, let us take from the New Testament a text showing\r\nwhat it is that both Plato and the prophets mean when they tell us that\r\nwe ought to love righteousness and to make our study in the law of the\r\nEternal, but that the unsound majority do nothing of the kind. A score\r\nof texts offer themselves in a moment. Here is one which will serve very\r\nwell: ‘Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are elevated,\r\nwhatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever\r\nthings are amiable, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be\r\nany virtue, and if there be any praise; have these in your mind, let\r\nyour thoughts run upon these.’[1] That is what both Plato and the\r\nprophets mean by loving righteousness, and making one’s study in the law\r\nof the Eternal.\r\n\r\nNow the matters just enumerated do not come much into the heads of most\r\nof us, I suppose, when we are thinking of politics. But the philosophers\r\nand prophets maintain that these matters, and not those of which the\r\nheads of politicians are full, do really govern politics and save or\r\ndestroy States. They save or destroy them by a silent, inexorable\r\nfatality; while the politicians are making believe, plausibly and\r\nnoisily, with their American institutions, British Constitution, and\r\ncivilising mission of France. And because these matters are what do\r\nreally govern politics and save or destroy States, Socrates maintained\r\nthat in his time he and a few philosophers, who alone kept insisting on\r\nthe good of righteousness and the unprofitableness of iniquity, were the\r\nonly real politicians then living.\r\n\r\nI say, if we are to derive comfort from the doctrine of _the remnant_\r\n(and there is great comfort to be derived from it), we must also hold\r\nfast to the austere but true doctrine as to what really governs\r\npolitics, overrides with an inexorable fatality the combinations of the\r\nso-called politicians, and saves or destroys States. Having in mind\r\nthings true, things elevated, things just, things pure, things amiable,\r\nthings of good report; having these in mind, studying and loving these,\r\nis what saves States.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing like positive instances to illustrate general\r\npropositions of this kind, and to make them believed. I hesitate to take\r\nan instance from America. Possibly there are some people who think that\r\nalready, on a former occasion, I have said enough about America without\r\nduly seeing and knowing it. So I will take my instances from England,\r\nand from England’s neighbour and old co-mate in history, France. The\r\ninstance from England I will take first. I will take it from the grave\r\ntopic of England’s relations with Ireland. I am not going to reproach\r\neither England or Ireland. To reproach Ireland here would probably be\r\nindiscreet. As to England, anything I may have to say against my own\r\ncountrymen I prefer to say at home; America is the last place where I\r\nshould care to say it. However, I have no wish or intention now to\r\nreproach either the English or the Irish. But I want to show you from\r\nEngland’s relations with Ireland how right the philosophers and prophets\r\nare. Every one knows that there has been conquest and confiscation in\r\nIreland. So there has elsewhere. Every one knows that the conquest and\r\nthe confiscation have been attended with cupidity, oppression, and\r\nill-usage. So they have elsewhere. ‘Whatsoever things are just’ are not\r\nexactly the study, so far as I know, of conquerors and confiscators\r\nanywhere; certainly they were not the study of the English conquerors of\r\nIreland. A failure in justice is a source of danger to States. But it\r\nmay be made up for and got over; it has been made up for and got over in\r\nmany communities. England’s confiscations in Ireland are a thing of the\r\npast; the penal laws against Catholics are a thing of the past; much has\r\nbeen done to make up for the old failure in justice; Englishmen\r\ngenerally think that it has been pretty well made up for, and that\r\nIrishmen ought to think so too. And politicians invent Land Acts for\r\ncuring the last results of the old failure in justice, for insuring the\r\ncontentment of the Irish with us, and for consolidating the Union: and\r\nare surprised and plaintive if it is not consolidated. But now see how\r\nmuch more serious people are the philosophers and prophets than the\r\npoliticians. _Whatsoever things are amiable!_—the failure in\r\namiability, too, is a source of danger and insecurity to States, as well\r\nas the failure in justice. And we English are not amiable, or at any\r\nrate, what in this case comes to the same thing, do not appear so. The\r\npoliticians never thought of that! Quite outside their combinations lies\r\nthis hindrance, tending to make their most elaborate combinations\r\nineffectual. Thus the joint operation of two moral causes together,—the\r\nsort of causes which politicians do not seriously regard,—tells against\r\nthe designs of the politicians with what seems to be an almost\r\ninexorable fatality. If there were not the failure in amiability,\r\nperhaps the original failure in justice might by this time have been got\r\nover; if there had not been the failure in justice, perhaps the failure\r\nin amiability might not have mattered much. The two failures together\r\ncreate a difficulty almost insurmountable. Public men in England keep\r\nsaying that it will be got over. I hope that it will be got over, and\r\nthat the union between England and Ireland may become as solid as that\r\nbetween England and Scotland. But it will not become solid by means of\r\nthe contrivances of the mere politician, or without the intervention of\r\nmoral causes of concord to heal the mischief wrought by moral causes of\r\ndivision. Everything, in this case, depends upon the ‘remnant,’ its\r\nnumbers, and its powers of action.\r\n\r\nMy second instance is even more important. It is so important, and its\r\nreach is so wide, that I must go into it with some little fulness. The\r\ninstance is taken from France. To France I have always felt myself\r\npowerfully drawn. People in England often accuse me of liking France and\r\nthings French far too well. At all events I have paid special regard to\r\nthem, and am always glad to confess how much I owe to them. M.\r\nSainte-Beuve wrote to me in the last years of his life: ‘You have passed\r\nthrough our life and literature by a deep inner line, which confers\r\ninitiation, and which you will never lose.’ _Vous avez traversé notre\r\nvie et notre littérature par une ligne intérieure, profonde, qui fait\r\nles initiés, et que vous ne perdrez jamais._ I wish I could think that\r\nthis friendly testimony of that accomplished and charming man, one of my\r\nchief benefactors, were fully deserved. But I have pride and pleasure in\r\nquoting it; and I quote it to bear me out in saying, that whatever\r\nopinion I may express about France, I have at least been a not\r\ninattentive observer of that great country, and anything but a hostile\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe question was once asked by the town clerk of Ephesus: ‘What man is\r\nthere that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a\r\nworshipper of the great goddess Diana?’ Now really, when one looks at\r\nthe popular literature of the French at this moment,—their popular\r\nnovels, popular stage-plays, popular newspapers,—and at the life of\r\nwhich this literature of theirs is the index, one is tempted to make a\r\ngoddess out of a word of their own, and then, like the town clerk of\r\nEphesus, to ask: ‘What man is there that knoweth not how that the city\r\nof the French is a worshipper of the great goddess Lubricity?’ Or\r\nrather, as Greek is the classic and euphonious language for names of\r\ngods and goddesses, let us take her name from the Greek Testament, and\r\ncall her the goddess Aselgeia. That goddess has always been a sufficient\r\npower amongst mankind, and her worship was generally supposed to need\r\nrestraining rather than encouraging. But here is now a whole popular\r\nliterature, nay, and art too, in France at her service! stimulations and\r\nsuggestions by her and to her meet one in it at every turn. She is\r\nbecoming the great recognised power there; never was anything like it.\r\nM. Renan himself seems half inclined to apologise for not having paid\r\nher more attention. ‘Nature cares nothing for chastity,’ says he; _Les\r\nfrivoles ont peut-être raison;_ ‘The gay people are perhaps in the\r\nright,’ Men even of this force salute her; but the allegiance now paid\r\nto her, in France, by the popular novel, the popular newspaper, the\r\npopular play, is, one may say, boundless.\r\n\r\nI have no wish at all to preach to the French; no intention whatever, in\r\nwhat I now say, to upbraid or wound them. I simply lay my finger on a\r\nfact in their present condition; a fact insufficiently noticed, as it\r\nseems to me, and yet extremely potent for mischief. It is well worth\r\nwhile to trace the manner of its growth and action.\r\n\r\nThe French have always had a leaning to the goddess of whom we speak,\r\nand have been willing enough to let the world know of their leaning, to\r\npride themselves on their Gaulish salt, their gallantry, and so on. But\r\nthings have come to their present head gradually. Catholicism was an\r\nobstacle; the serious element in the nation was another obstacle. But\r\nnow just see the course which things have taken, and how they all, one\r\nmay say, have worked together, for this goddess. First, there was the\r\noriginal Gaul, the basis of the French nation; the Gaul, gay, sociable,\r\nquick of sentiment, quick of perception; apt, however, very apt, to be\r\npresumptuous and puffed up. Then came the Roman conquest, and from this\r\nwe get a new personage, the Gallo-Latin; with the Gaulish qualities for\r\na basis, but with Latin order, reason, lucidity, added, and also Latin\r\nsensuality. Finally, we have the Frankish conquest and the Frenchman.\r\nThe Frenchman proper is the Gallo-Latin, with Frankish or Germanic\r\nqualities added and infused. No mixture could be better. The Germans\r\nhave plenty of faults, but in this combination they seem not to have\r\ntaken hold; the Germans seem to have given of their seriousness and\r\nhonesty to the conquered Gallo-Latin, and not of their brutality. And\r\nmediæval France, which exhibits the combination and balance, under the\r\ninfluence then exercised by Catholicism, of Gaulish quickness and gaiety\r\nwith Latin rationality and German seriousness, offers to our view the\r\nsoundest and the most attractive stage, perhaps, in all French history.\r\n\r\nBut the balance could not be maintained; at any rate, it was not\r\nmaintained. Mediæval Catholicism lost its virtue. The serious Germanic\r\nraces made the Reformation, feeling that without it there was no safety\r\nand continuance for those moral ideas which they loved and which were\r\nthe ground of their being. France did not go with the Reformation; the\r\nGermanic qualities in her were not strong enough to make her go with it.\r\n‘France did not want a reformation which was a moral one,’ is Michelet’s\r\naccount of the matter: _La France ne voulait pas de réforme morale._ Let\r\nus put the case more favourably for her, and say that perhaps, with her\r\nquick perception, France caught sense, from the very outset, of that\r\nintellectual unsoundness and incompleteness in the Reformation, which is\r\nnow so visible. But, at any rate, the Reformation did not carry France\r\nwith it; and the Germanic side in the Frenchman, his Germanic qualities,\r\nthus received a check. They subsisted, however, in good force still; the\r\nnew knowledge and new ideas, brought by the revival of letters, gave an\r\nanimating stimulus; and in the seventeenth century the Gaulish gaiety\r\nand quickness of France, the Latin rationality, and the still subsisting\r\nGerman seriousness, all combining under the puissant breath of the\r\nRenascence, produced a literature, the strongest, the most substantial\r\nand the most serious which the French have ever succeeded in producing,\r\nand which has, indeed, consummate and splendid excellences.\r\n\r\nStill, the Germanic side in the Frenchman had received a check, and in\r\nthe next century this side became quite attenuated. The Germanic\r\nsteadiness and seriousness gave way more and more; the Gaulish salt, the\r\nGaulish gaiety, quickness, sentiment, and sociability, the Latin\r\nrationality, prevailed more and more, and had the field nearly to\r\nthemselves. They produced a brilliant and most efficacious\r\nliterature,—the French literature of the eighteenth century. The\r\ngoddess Aselgeia had her part in it; it was a literature to be praised\r\nwith reserves; it was, above all, a revolutionary literature. But\r\nEuropean institutions were then in such a superannuated condition,\r\nstraightforward and just perception, free thought and rationality, were\r\nat such a discount, that the brilliant French literature in which these\r\nqualities predominated, and which by their predominance was made\r\nrevolutionary, had in the eighteenth century a great mission to fulfil,\r\nand fulfilled it victoriously.\r\n\r\nThe mission is fulfilled, but meanwhile the Germanic quality in the\r\nFrenchman seems pretty nearly to have died out, and the Gallo-Latin in\r\nhim has quite got the upper hand. Of course there are individuals and\r\ngroups who are to be excepted; I will allow any number of exceptions you\r\nplease; and in the mass of the French people, which works and is silent,\r\nthere may be treasures of resource. But taking the Frenchman who is\r\ncommonly in view—the usual type of speaking, doing, vocal, visible\r\nFrenchman—we may say, and he will probably be not at all displeased at\r\nour saying, that the German in him has nearly died out, and the\r\nGallo-Latin has quite got the upper hand. For us, however, this means\r\nthat the chief source of seriousness and of moral ideas is failing and\r\ndrying up in him, and that what remains are the sources of Gaulish salt,\r\nand quickness, and sentiment, and sociability, and sensuality, and\r\nrationality. And, of course, the play and working of these qualities is\r\naltered by their being no longer in combination with a dose of German\r\nseriousness, but left to work by themselves. Left to work by themselves,\r\nthey give us what we call the _homme sensuel moyen_, the average sensual\r\nman. The highest art, the art which by its height, depth, and gravity\r\npossesses religiousness,—such as the Greeks had, the art of Pindar and\r\nPhidias; such as the Italians had, the art of Dante and Michael\r\nAngelo,—this art, with the training which it gives and the standard\r\nwhich it sets up, the French have never had. On the other hand, they had\r\na dose of German seriousness, a Germanic bent for ideas of moral duty,\r\nwhich neither the Greeks had, nor the Italians. But if this dies out,\r\nwhat is left is the _homme sensuel moyen_. This average sensual man has\r\nhis very advantageous qualities. He has his gaiety, quickness,\r\nsentiment, sociability, rationality. He has his horror of sour\r\nstrictness, false restraint, hypocrisy, obscurantism, cretinism, and the\r\nrest of it. And this is very well; but on the serious, moral side he is\r\nalmost ludicrously insufficient. Fine sentiments about his dignity and\r\nhis honour and his heart, about the dignity and the honour and the heart\r\nof France, and his adoration of her, do duty for him here; grandiose\r\nphrases about the spectacle offered in France and in the French Republic\r\nof the ideal for our race, of the _épanouissement de l’élite de\r\nl’humanité_, ‘the coming into blow of the choice flower of humanity.’ In\r\nM. Victor Hugo we have (his worshippers must forgive me for saying so)\r\nthe average sensual man impassioned and grandiloquent; in M. Zola we\r\nhave the average sensual man going near the ground. ‘Happy the son,’\r\ncries M. Victor Hugo, ‘of whom, one can say, “He has consoled his\r\nmother!” Happy the poet of whom one can say, “He has consoled his\r\ncountry!”’ The French themselves, even when they are severest, call this\r\nkind of thing by only the mild name of emphasis, ‘_emphase_,’—other\r\npeople call it fustian. And a surly Johnson will growl out in answer, at\r\none time, that ‘Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel’; at\r\nanother time, that fine sentiments about _ma mère_ are the last refuge\r\nof a scoundrel. But what they really are is the creed which in France\r\nthe average sensual man rehearses, to do duty for serious moral ideas.\r\nAnd, as the result, we have a popular literature and a popular art\r\nserving, as has been already said, the goddess Aselgeia.\r\n\r\nSuch an art and literature easily make their way everywhere. In England\r\nand America the French literature of the seventeenth century is\r\npeculiarly fitted to do great good, and nothing but good; it can hardly\r\nbe too much studied by us. And it is studied by us very little. The\r\nFrench literature of the eighteenth century, also, has qualities to do\r\nus much good, and we are not likely to take harm from its other\r\nqualities; we may study it to our great profit and advantage. And it is\r\nstudied by us very little. The higher French literature of the present\r\nday has more knowledge and a wider range than its great predecessors,\r\nbut less soundness and perfection, and it exerts much less influence\r\nthan they did. Action and influence are now with the lower literature of\r\nFrance, with the popular literature in the service of the goddess\r\nAselgeia. And this popular modern French literature, and the art which\r\ncorresponds to it, bid fair to make their way in England and America far\r\nbetter than their predecessors. They appeal to instincts so universal\r\nand accessible; they appeal, people are beginning boldly to say, to\r\nNature herself. Few things have lately struck me more than M. Renan’s\r\ndictum, which I have already quoted, about what used to be called the\r\nvirtue of chastity. The dictum occurs in his very interesting\r\nautobiography, published but the other day. M. Renan, whose genius I\r\nunfeignedly admire, is, I need hardly say, a man of the most perfect\r\npropriety of life; he has told us so himself. He was brought up for a\r\npriest, and he thinks it would not have been in good taste for him to\r\nbecome a free liver. But this abstinence is a mere matter of personal\r\ndelicacy, a display of good and correct taste on his own part in his own\r\nvery special circumstances. ‘Nature,’ he cries, ‘cares nothing about\r\nchastity.’ What a slap in the face to the sticklers for ‘Whatsoever\r\nthings are pure’!\r\n\r\nI have had to take a long sweep to arrive at the point which I wished to\r\nreach. If we are to enjoy the benefit, I said, of the comfortable\r\ndoctrine of the remnant, we must be capable of receiving also, and of\r\nholding fast, the hard doctrine of the unsoundness of the majority, and\r\nof the certainty that the unsoundness of the majority, if it is not\r\nwithstood and remedied, must be their ruin. And therefore, even though a\r\ngifted man like M. Renan may be so carried away by the tide of opinion\r\nin France where he lives, as to say that Nature cares nothing about\r\nchastity, and to see with amused indulgence the worship of the great\r\ngoddess Lubricity, let us stand fast, and say that her worship is\r\nagainst nature, human nature, and that it is ruin. For this is the test\r\nof its being against human nature, that for human societies it is ruin.\r\nAnd the test is one from which there is no escape, as from the old tests\r\nin such matters there may be. For if you allege that it is the will of\r\nGod that we should be pure, the sceptical Gallo-Latins will tell you\r\nthat they do not know any such person. And in like manner, if it is said\r\nthat those who serve the goddess Aselgeia shall not inherit the kingdom\r\nof God, the Gallo-Latin may tell you that he does not believe in any\r\nsuch place. But that the sure tendency and upshot of things establishes\r\nthat the service of the goddess Aselgeia is ruin, that her followers are\r\nmarred and stunted by it and disqualified for the ideal society of the\r\nfuture, is an infallible test to employ.\r\n\r\nThe saints admonish us to let our thoughts run upon whatsoever things\r\nare pure, if we would inherit the kingdom of God; and the divine Plato\r\ntells us that we have within us a many-headed beast and a man, and that\r\nby dissoluteness we feed and strengthen the beast in us, and starve the\r\nman; and finally, following the divine Plato among the sages at a humble\r\ndistance, comes the prosaic and unfashionable Paley, and says in his\r\nprecise way that ‘this vice has a tendency, which other species of vice\r\nhave not so directly, to unsettle and weaken the powers of the\r\nunderstanding; as well as, I think, in a greater degree than other\r\nvices, to render the heart thoroughly corrupt.’ True; and once admitted\r\nand fostered, it eats like a canker, and with difficulty can ever be\r\nbrought to let go its hold again, but for ever tightens it. Hardness and\r\ninsolence come in its train; an insolence which grows until it ends by\r\nexasperating and alienating everybody; a hardness which grows until the\r\nman can at last scarcely take pleasure in anything, outside the service\r\nof his goddess, except cupidity and greed, and cannot be touched with\r\nemotion by any language except fustian. Such are the fruits of the\r\nworship of the great goddess Aselgeia.\r\n\r\nSo, instead of saying that Nature cares nothing about chastity, let us\r\nsay that human nature, _our_ nature, cares about it a great deal. Let us\r\nsay that, by her present popular literature, France gives proof that she\r\nis suffering from a dangerous and perhaps fatal disease; and that it is\r\nnot clericalism which is the real enemy to the French so much as their\r\ngoddess; and if they can none of them see this themselves, it is only a\r\nsign of how far the disease has gone, and the case is so much the worse.\r\nThe case is so much the worse; and for men in such case to be so\r\nvehemently busy about clerical and dynastic intrigues at home, and about\r\nalliances and colonial acquisitions and purifications of the flag\r\nabroad, might well make one borrow of the prophets and exclaim, ‘Surely\r\nye are perverse’! perverse to neglect your really pressing matters for\r\nthose secondary ones. And when the ingenious and inexhaustible M.\r\nBlowitz, of our great London _Times_, who sees everybody and knows\r\neverything, when he expounds the springs of politics and the causes of\r\nthe fall and success of ministries, and the combinations which have not\r\nbeen tried but should be, and takes upon him the mystery of things in\r\nthe way with which we are so familiar,—to this wise man himself one is\r\noften tempted, again, to say with the prophets: ‘Yet the Eternal also is\r\nwise, and will not call back his words.’ M. Blowitz is not the only wise\r\none; the Eternal has his wisdom also, and somehow or other it is always\r\nthe Eternal’s wisdom which at last carries the day. The Eternal has\r\nattached to certain moral causes the safety or the ruin of States, and\r\nthe present popular literature of France is a sign that she has a most\r\ndangerous moral disease.\r\n\r\nNow if the disease goes on and increases, then, whatever sagacious\r\nadvice M. Blowitz may give, and whatever political combinations may be\r\ntried, and whether France gets colonies or not, and whether she allies\r\nherself with this nation or with that, things will only go from bad to\r\nworse with her; she will more and more lose her powers of soul and\r\nspirit, her intellectual productiveness, her skill in counsel, her might\r\nfor war, her formidableness as a foe, her value as an ally, and the life\r\nof that famous State will be more and more impaired, until it perish.\r\nAnd this is that hard but true doctrine of the sages and prophets, of\r\nthe inexorable fatality of operation, in moral failure of the unsound\r\nmajority, to impair and destroy States. But we will not talk or think of\r\ndestruction for a State with such gifts and graces as France, and which\r\nhas had such a place in history, and to which we, many of us, owe so\r\nmuch delight and so much good. And yet if France had no greater numbers\r\nthan the Athens of Plato or the Judah of Isaiah, I do not see how she\r\ncould well escape out of the throttling arms of her goddess and recover.\r\nShe must recover through a powerful and profound renewal, a great inward\r\nchange, brought about by ‘the remnant’ amongst her people; and, for\r\nthis, a remnant small in numbers would not suffice. But in a France of\r\nthirty-five millions, who shall set bounds to the numbers of the\r\nremnant, or to its effectualness and power of victory?\r\n\r\nIn these United States (for I come round to the United States at last)\r\nyou are fifty millions and more. I suppose that, as in England, as in\r\nFrance, as everywhere, so likewise here, the majority of people doubt\r\nvery much whether the majority is unsound; or, rather, they have no\r\ndoubt at all about the matter, they are sure that it is not unsound. But\r\nlet us consent to-night to remain to the end in the ideas of the sages\r\nand prophets whom we have been following all along; and let us suppose\r\nthat in the present actual stage of the world, as in all the stages\r\nthrough which the world has passed hitherto, the majority is and must be\r\nin general unsound everywhere,—even in the United States, even here in\r\nNew York itself. Where is the failure? I have already, in the past,\r\nspeculated in the abstract about you, perhaps, too much. But I suppose\r\nthat in a democratic community like this, with its newness, its\r\nmagnitude, its strength, its life of business, its sheer freedom and\r\nequality, the danger is in the absence of the discipline of respect; in\r\nhardness and materialism, exaggeration and boastfulness; in a false\r\nsmartness, a false audacity, a want of soul and delicacy. ‘Whatsoever\r\nthings are _elevated_,’—whatsoever things are nobly serious, have true\r\nelevation,[2]—that perhaps, in our catalogue of maxims which are to\r\npossess the mind, is the maxim which points to where the failure of the\r\nunsound majority, in a great democracy like yours, will probably lie. At\r\nany rate let us for the moment agree to suppose so. And the philosophers\r\nand the prophets, whom I at any rate am disposed to believe, and who say\r\nthat moral causes govern the standing and the falling of States, will\r\ntell us that the failure to mind whatsoever things are elevated must\r\nimpair with an inexorable fatality the life of a nation, just as the\r\nfailure to mind whatsoever things are just, or whatsoever things are\r\namiable, or whatsoever things are pure, will impair it; and that if the\r\nfailure to mind whatsoever things are elevated should be real in your\r\nAmerican democracy, and should grow into a disease, and take firm hold\r\non you, then the life of even these great United States must inevitably\r\nsuffer and be impaired more and more, until it perish.\r\n\r\nThen from this hard doctrine we will betake ourselves to the more\r\ncomfortable doctrine of _the remnant_. ‘The remnant shall return;’ shall\r\n‘convert and be healed’ itself first, and shall then recover the unsound\r\nmajority. And you are fifty millions and growing apace. What a remnant\r\nyours may be, surely! A remnant of how great numbers, how mighty\r\nstrength, how irresistible efficacy! Yet we must not go too fast,\r\neither, nor make too sure of our efficacious remnant. Mere multitude\r\nwill not give us a saving remnant with certainty. The Assyrian Empire\r\nhad multitude, the Roman Empire had multitude; yet neither the one nor\r\nthe other could produce a sufficing remnant any more than Athens or\r\nJudah could produce it, and both Assyria and Rome perished like Athens\r\nand Judah.\r\n\r\nBut you are something more than a people of fifty millions. You are\r\nfifty millions mainly sprung, as we in England are mainly sprung, from\r\nthat German stock which has faults indeed,—faults which have diminished\r\nthe extent of its influence, diminished its power of attraction and the\r\ninterest of its history, and which seems moreover just now, from all I\r\ncan see and hear, to be passing through a not very happy moment,\r\nmorally, in Germany proper. Yet of the German stock it is, I think,\r\ntrue, as my father said more than fifty years ago, that it has been a\r\nstock ‘of the most moral races of men that the world has yet seen, with\r\nthe soundest laws, the least violent passions, the fairest domestic and\r\ncivil virtues.’ You come, therefore, of about the best parentage which a\r\nmodern nation can have. Then you have had, as we in England have also\r\nhad, but more entirely than we and more exclusively, the Puritan\r\ndiscipline. Certainly I am not blind to the faults of that discipline.\r\nCertainly I do not wish it to remain in possession of the field for\r\never, or too long. But as a stage and a discipline, and as means for\r\nenabling that poor inattentive and immoral creature, man, to love and\r\nappropriate and make part of his being divine ideas, on which he could\r\nnot otherwise have laid or kept hold, the discipline of Puritanism has\r\nbeen invaluable; and the more I read history, the more I see of mankind,\r\nthe more I recognise its value. Well, then, you are not merely a\r\nmultitude of fifty millions; you are fifty millions sprung from this\r\nexcellent Germanic stock, having passed through this excellent Puritan\r\ndiscipline, and set in this enviable and unbounded country. Even\r\nsupposing, therefore, that by the necessity of things your majority must\r\nin the present stage of the world probably be unsound, what a remnant, I\r\nsay,—what an incomparable, all-transforming remnant,—you may fairly\r\nhope with your numbers, if things go happily, to have!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  LITERATURE AND SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPractical people talk with a smile of Plato and of his absolute ideas;\r\nand it is impossible to deny that Plato’s ideas do often seem\r\nunpractical and impracticable, and especially when one views them in\r\nconnexion with the life of a great work-a-day world like the United\r\nStates. The necessary staple of the life of such a world Plato regards\r\nwith disdain; handicraft and trade and the working professions he\r\nregards with disdain; but what becomes of the life of an industrial\r\nmodern community if you take handicraft and trade and the working\r\nprofessions out of it? The base mechanic arts and handicrafts, says\r\nPlato, bring about a natural weakness in the principle of excellence in\r\na man, so that he cannot govern the ignoble growths in him, but nurses\r\nthem, and cannot understand fostering any other. Those who exercise such\r\narts and trades, as they have their bodies, he says, marred by their\r\nvulgar businesses, so they have their souls, too, bowed and broken by\r\nthem. And if one of these uncomely people has a mind to seek\r\nself-culture and philosophy, Plato compares him to a bald little tinker,\r\nwho has scraped together money, and has got his release from service,\r\nand has had a bath, and bought a new coat, and is rigged out like a\r\nbridegroom about to marry the daughter of his master who has fallen into\r\npoor and helpless estate.\r\n\r\nNor do the working professions fare any better than trade at the hands\r\nof Plato. He draws for us an inimitable picture of the working lawyer,\r\nand of his life of bondage; he shows how this bondage from his youth up\r\nhas stunted and warped him, and made him small and crooked of soul,\r\nencompassing him with difficulties which he is not man enough to rely on\r\njustice and truth as means to encounter, but has recourse, for help out\r\nof them, to falsehood and wrong. And so, says Plato, this poor creature\r\nis bent and broken, and grows up from boy to man without a particle of\r\nsoundness in him, although exceedingly smart and clever in his own\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\nOne cannot refuse to admire the artist who draws these pictures. But we\r\nsay to ourselves that his ideas show the influence of a primitive and\r\nobsolete order of things, when the warrior caste and the priestly caste\r\nwere alone in honour, and the humble work of the world was done by\r\nslaves. We have now changed all that; the modern majority consists in\r\nwork, as Emerson declares; and in work, we may add, principally of such\r\nplain and dusty kind as the work of cultivators of the ground,\r\nhandicraftsmen, men of trade and business, men of the working\r\nprofessions. Above all is this true in a great industrious community\r\nsuch as that of the United States.\r\n\r\nNow education, many people go on to say, is still mainly governed by the\r\nideas of men like Plato, who lived when the warrior caste and the\r\npriestly or philosophical class were alone in honour, and the really\r\nuseful part of the community were slaves. It is an education fitted for\r\npersons of leisure in such a community. This education passed from\r\nGreece and Rome to the feudal communities of Europe, where also the\r\nwarrior caste and the priestly caste were alone held in honour, and\r\nwhere the really useful and working part of the community, though not\r\nnominally slaves as in the pagan world, were practically not much better\r\noff than slaves, and not more seriously regarded. And how absurd it is,\r\npeople end by saying, to inflict this education upon an industrious\r\nmodern community, where very few indeed are persons of leisure, and the\r\nmass to be considered has not leisure, but is bound, for its own great\r\ngood, and for the great good of the world at large, to plain labour and\r\nto industrial pursuits, and the education in question tends necessarily\r\nto make men dissatisfied with these pursuits and unfitted for them!\r\n\r\nThat is what is said. So far I must defend Plato, as to plead that his\r\nview of education and studies is in the general, as it seems to me,\r\nsound enough, and fitted for all sorts and conditions of men, whatever\r\ntheir pursuits may be. ‘An intelligent man,’ says Plato, ‘will prize\r\nthose studies which result in his soul getting soberness, righteousness,\r\nand wisdom, and will less value the others.’ I cannot consider _that_ a\r\nbad description of the aim of education, and of the motives which should\r\ngovern us in the choice of studies, whether we are preparing ourselves\r\nfor a hereditary seat in the English House of Lords or for the pork\r\ntrade in Chicago.\r\n\r\nStill I admit that Plato’s world was not ours, that his scorn of trade\r\nand handicraft is fantastic, that he had no conception of a great\r\nindustrial community such as that of the United States, and that such a\r\ncommunity must and will shape its education to suit its own needs. If\r\nthe usual education handed down to it from the past does not suit it, it\r\nwill certainly before long drop this and try another. The usual\r\neducation in the past has been mainly literary. The question is whether\r\nthe studies which were long supposed to be the best for all of us are\r\npractically the best now; whether others are not better. The tyranny of\r\nthe past, many think, weighs on us injuriously in the predominance given\r\nto letters in education. The question is raised whether, to meet the\r\nneeds of our modern life, the predominance ought not now to pass from\r\nletters to science; and naturally the question is nowhere raised with\r\nmore energy than here in the United States. The design of abasing what\r\nis called ‘mere literary instruction and education,’ and of exalting\r\nwhat is called ‘sound, extensive, and practical scientific knowledge,’\r\nis, in this intensely modern world of the United States, even more\r\nperhaps than in Europe, a very popular design, and makes great and rapid\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nI am going to ask whether the present movement for ousting letters from\r\ntheir old predominance in education, and for transferring the\r\npredominance in education to the natural sciences, whether this brisk\r\nand flourishing movement ought to prevail, and whether it is likely that\r\nin the end it really will prevail. An objection may be raised which I\r\nwill anticipate. My own studies have been almost wholly in letters, and\r\nmy visits to the field of the natural sciences have been very slight and\r\ninadequate, although those sciences have always strongly moved my\r\ncuriosity. A man of letters, it will perhaps be said, is not competent\r\nto discuss the comparative merits of letters and natural science as\r\nmeans of education. To this objection I reply, first of all, that his\r\nincompetence, if he attempts the discussion but is really incompetent\r\nfor it, will be abundantly visible; nobody will be taken in; he will\r\nhave plenty of sharp observers and critics to save mankind from that\r\ndanger. But the line I am going to follow is, as you will soon discover,\r\nso extremely simple, that perhaps it may be followed without failure\r\neven by one who for a more ambitious line of discussion would be quite\r\nincompetent.\r\n\r\nSome of you may possibly remember a phrase of mine which has been the\r\nobject of a good deal of comment; an observation to the effect that in\r\nour culture, the aim being _to know ourselves and the world_, we have,\r\nas the means to this end, _to know the best which has been thought and\r\nsaid in the world_. A man of science, who is also an excellent writer\r\nand the very prince of debaters, Professor Huxley, in a discourse at the\r\nopening of Sir Josiah Mason’s college at Birmingham, laying hold of this\r\nphrase, expanded it by quoting some more words of mine, which are these:\r\n‘The civilised world is to be regarded as now being, for intellectual\r\nand spiritual purposes, one great confederation, bound to a joint action\r\nand working to a common result; and whose members have for their proper\r\noutfit a knowledge of Greek, Roman, and Eastern antiquity, and of one\r\nanother. Special local and temporary advantages being put out of\r\naccount, that modern nation will in the intellectual and spiritual\r\nsphere make most progress, which most thoroughly carries out this\r\nprogramme.’\r\n\r\nNow on my phrase, thus enlarged, Professor Huxley remarks that when I\r\nspeak of the above-mentioned knowledge as enabling us to know ourselves\r\nand the world, I assert _literature_ to contain the materials which\r\nsuffice for thus making us know ourselves and the world. But it is not\r\nby any means clear, says he, that after having learnt all which ancient\r\nand modern literatures have to tell us, we have laid a sufficiently\r\nbroad and deep foundation for that criticism of life, that knowledge of\r\nourselves and the world, which constitutes culture. On the contrary,\r\nProfessor Huxley declares that he finds himself ‘wholly unable to admit\r\nthat either nations or individuals will really advance, if their outfit\r\ndraws nothing from the stores of physical science. An army without\r\nweapons of precision, and with no particular base of operations, might\r\nmore hopefully enter upon a campaign on the Rhine, than a man, devoid of\r\na knowledge of what physical science has done in the last century, upon\r\na criticism of life.’\r\n\r\nThis shows how needful it is for those who are to discuss any matter\r\ntogether, to have a common understanding as to the sense of the terms\r\nthey employ,—how needful, and how difficult. What Professor Huxley\r\nsays, implies just the reproach which is so often brought against the\r\nstudy of _belles lettres_, as they are called: that the study is an\r\nelegant one, but slight and ineffectual; a smattering of Greek and Latin\r\nand other ornamental things, of little use for any one whose object is\r\nto get at truth, and to be a practical man. So, too, M. Renan talks of\r\nthe ‘superficial humanism’ of a school-course which treats us as if we\r\nwere all going to be poets, writers, preachers, orators, and he opposes\r\nthis humanism to positive science, or the critical search after truth.\r\nAnd there is always a tendency in those who are remonstrating against\r\nthe predominance of letters in education, to understand by letters\r\n_belles lettres_, and by _belles lettres_ a superficial humanism, the\r\nopposite of science or true knowledge.\r\n\r\nBut when we talk of knowing Greek and Roman antiquity, for instance,\r\nwhich is the knowledge people have called the humanities, I for my part\r\nmean a knowledge which is something more than a superficial humanism,\r\nmainly decorative. ‘I call all teaching _scientific_,’ says Wolf, the\r\ncritic of Homer, ‘which is systematically laid out and followed up to\r\nits original sources. For example: a knowledge of classical antiquity is\r\nscientific when the remains of classical antiquity are correctly studied\r\nin the original languages.’ There can be no doubt that Wolf is perfectly\r\nright; that all learning is scientific which is systematically laid out\r\nand followed up to its original sources, and that a genuine humanism is\r\nscientific.\r\n\r\nWhen I speak of knowing Greek and Roman antiquity, therefore, as a help\r\nto knowing ourselves and the world, I mean more than a knowledge of so\r\nmuch vocabulary, so much grammar, so many portions of authors in the\r\nGreek and Latin languages. I mean knowing the Greeks and Romans, and\r\ntheir life and genius, and what they were and did in the world; what we\r\nget from them, and what is its value. That, at least, is the ideal; and\r\nwhen we talk of endeavouring to know Greek and Roman antiquity, as a\r\nhelp to knowing ourselves and the world, we mean endeavouring so to know\r\nthem as to satisfy this ideal, however much we may still fall short of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe same also as to knowing our own and other modern nations, with the\r\nlike aim of getting to understand ourselves and the world. To know the\r\nbest that has been thought and said by the modern nations, is to know,\r\nsays Professor Huxley, ‘only what modern _literatures_ have to tell us;\r\nit is the criticism of life contained in modern literature.’ And yet\r\n‘the distinctive character of our times,’ he urges, ‘lies in the vast\r\nand constantly increasing part which is played by natural knowledge.’\r\nAnd how, therefore, can a man, devoid of knowledge of what physical\r\nscience has done in the last century, enter hopefully upon a criticism\r\nof modern life?\r\n\r\nLet us, I say, be agreed about the meaning of the terms we are using. I\r\ntalk of knowing the best which has been thought and uttered in the\r\nworld; Professor Huxley says this means knowing _literature_. Literature\r\nis a large word; it may mean everything written with letters or printed\r\nin a book. Euclid’s _Elements_ and Newton’s _Principia_ are thus\r\nliterature. All knowledge that reaches us through books is literature.\r\nBut by literature Professor Huxley means _belles lettres_. He means to\r\nmake me say, that knowing the best which has been thought and said by\r\nthe modern nations is knowing their _belles lettres_ and no more. And\r\nthis is no sufficient equipment, he argues, for a criticism of modern\r\nlife. But as I do not mean, by knowing ancient Rome, knowing merely more\r\nor less of Latin _belles lettres_, and taking no account of Rome’s\r\nmilitary, and political, and legal, and administrative work in the\r\nworld; and as, by knowing ancient Greece, I understand knowing her as\r\nthe giver of Greek art, and the guide to a free and right use of reason\r\nand to scientific method, and the founder of our mathematics and physics\r\nand astronomy and biology,—I understand knowing her as all this, and\r\nnot merely knowing certain Greek poems, and histories, and treatises,\r\nand speeches,—so as to the knowledge of modern nations also. By knowing\r\nmodern nations, I mean not merely knowing their _belles lettres_, but\r\nknowing also what has been done by such men as Copernicus, Galileo,\r\nNewton, Darwin. ‘Our ancestors learned,’ says Professor Huxley, ‘that\r\nthe earth is the centre of the visible universe, and that man is the\r\ncynosure of things terrestrial; and more especially was it inculcated\r\nthat the course of nature had no fixed order, but that it could be, and\r\nconstantly was, altered.’ But for us now, continues Professor Huxley,\r\n‘the notions of the beginning and the end of the world entertained by\r\nour forefathers are no longer credible. It is very certain that the\r\nearth is not the chief body in the material universe, and that the world\r\nis not subordinated to man’s use. It is even more certain that nature is\r\nthe expression of a definite order, with which nothing interferes.’ ‘And\r\nyet,’ he cries, ‘the purely classical education advocated by the\r\nrepresentatives of the humanists in our day gives no inkling of all\r\nthis!’\r\n\r\nIn due place and time I will just touch upon that vexed question of\r\nclassical education; but at present the question is as to what is meant\r\nby knowing the best which modern nations have thought and said. It is\r\nnot knowing their _belles lettres_ merely which is meant. To know\r\nItalian _belles lettres_ is not to know Italy, and to know English\r\n_belles lettres_ is not to know England. Into knowing Italy and England\r\nthere comes a great deal more, Galileo and Newton, amongst it. The\r\nreproach of being a superficial humanism, a tincture of _belles\r\nlettres_, may attach rightly enough to some other disciplines; but to\r\nthe particular discipline recommended when I proposed knowing the best\r\nthat has been thought and said in the world, it does not apply. In that\r\nbest I certainly include what in modern times has been thought and said\r\nby the great observers and knowers of nature.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, really no question between Professor Huxley and me\r\nas to whether knowing the great results of the modern scientific study\r\nof nature is not required as a part of our culture, as well as knowing\r\nthe products of literature and art. But to follow the processes by which\r\nthose results are reached, ought, say the friends of physical science,\r\nto be made the staple of education for the bulk of mankind. And here\r\nthere does arise a question between those whom Professor Huxley calls\r\nwith playful sarcasm ‘the Levites of culture,’ and those whom the poor\r\nhumanist is sometimes apt to regard as its Nebuchadnezzars.\r\n\r\nThe great results of the scientific investigation of nature we are\r\nagreed upon knowing, but how much of our study are we bound to give to\r\nthe processes by which those results are reached? The results have their\r\nvisible bearing on human life. But all the processes, too, all the items\r\nof fact, by which those results are reached and established, are\r\ninteresting. All knowledge is interesting to a wise man, and the\r\nknowledge of nature is interesting to all men. It is very interesting to\r\nknow, that, from the albuminous white of the egg, the chick in the egg\r\ngets the materials for its flesh, bones, blood, and feathers; while,\r\nfrom the fatty yolk of the egg, it gets the heat and energy which enable\r\nit at length to break its shell and begin the world. It is less\r\ninteresting, perhaps, but still it is interesting, to know that when a\r\ntaper burns, the wax is converted into carbonic acid and water.\r\nMoreover, it is quite true that the habit of dealing with facts, which\r\nis given by the study of nature, is, as the friends of physical science\r\npraise it for being, an excellent discipline. The appeal, in the study\r\nof nature, is constantly to observation and experiment; not only is it\r\nsaid that the thing is so, but we can be made to see that it is so. Not\r\nonly does a man tell us that when a taper burns the wax is converted\r\ninto carbonic acid and water, as a man may tell us, if he likes, that\r\nCharon is punting his ferry-boat on the river Styx, or that Victor Hugo\r\nis a sublime poet, or Mr. Gladstone the most admirable of statesmen; but\r\nwe are made to see that the conversion into carbonic acid and water does\r\nactually happen. This reality of natural knowledge it is, which makes\r\nthe friends of physical science contrast it, as a knowledge of things,\r\nwith the humanist’s knowledge, which is, say they, a knowledge of words.\r\nAnd hence Professor Huxley is moved to lay it down that, ‘for the\r\npurpose of attaining real culture, an exclusively scientific education\r\nis at least as effectual as an exclusively literary education.’ And a\r\ncertain President of the Section for Mechanical Science in the British\r\nAssociation is, in Scripture phrase, ‘very bold,’ and declares that if a\r\nman, in his mental training, ‘has substituted literature and history for\r\nnatural science, he has chosen the less useful alternative.’ But whether\r\nwe go these lengths or not, we must all admit that in natural science\r\nthe habit gained of dealing with facts is a most valuable discipline,\r\nand that every one should have some experience of it.\r\n\r\nMore than this, however, is demanded by the reformers. It is proposed to\r\nmake the training in natural science the main part of education, for the\r\ngreat majority of mankind at any rate. And here, I confess, I part\r\ncompany with the friends of physical science, with whom up to this point\r\nI have been agreeing. In differing from them, however, I wish to proceed\r\nwith the utmost caution and diffidence. The smallness of my own\r\nacquaintance with the disciplines of natural science is ever before my\r\nmind, and I am fearful of doing these disciplines an injustice. The\r\nability and pugnacity of the partisans of natural science makes them\r\nformidable persons to contradict. The tone of tentative inquiry, which\r\nbefits a being of dim faculties and bounded knowledge, is the tone I\r\nwould wish to take and not to depart from. At present it seems to me,\r\nthat those who are for giving to natural knowledge, as they call it, the\r\nchief place in the education of the majority of mankind, leave one\r\nimportant thing out of their account: the constitution of human nature.\r\nBut I put this forward on the strength of some facts not at all\r\nrecondite, very far from it; facts capable of being stated in the\r\nsimplest possible fashion, and to which, if I so state them, the man of\r\nscience will, I am sure, be willing to allow their due weight.\r\n\r\nDeny the facts altogether, I think, he hardly can. He can hardly deny,\r\nthat when we set ourselves to enumerate the powers which go to the\r\nbuilding up of human life, and say that they are the power of conduct,\r\nthe power of intellect and knowledge, the power of beauty, and the power\r\nof social life and manners,—he can hardly deny that this scheme, though\r\ndrawn in rough and plain lines enough, and not pretending to scientific\r\nexactness, does yet give a fairly true representation of the matter.\r\nHuman nature is built up by these powers; we have the need for them all.\r\nWhen we have rightly met and adjusted the claims of them all, we shall\r\nthen be in a fair way for getting soberness and righteousness, with\r\nwisdom. This is evident enough, and the friends of physical science\r\nwould admit it.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps they may not have sufficiently observed another thing:\r\nnamely, that the several powers just mentioned are not isolated, but\r\nthere is, in the generality of mankind, a perpetual tendency to relate\r\nthem one to another in divers ways. With one such way of relating them I\r\nam particularly concerned now. Following our instinct for intellect and\r\nknowledge, we acquire pieces of knowledge; and presently, in the\r\ngenerality of men, there arises the desire to relate these pieces of\r\nknowledge to our sense for conduct, to our sense for beauty,—and there\r\nis weariness and dissatisfaction if the desire is baulked. Now in this\r\ndesire lies, I think, the strength of that hold which letters have upon\r\nus.\r\n\r\nAll knowledge is, as I said just now, interesting; and even items of\r\nknowledge which from the nature of the case cannot well be related, but\r\nmust stand isolated in our thoughts, have their interest. Even lists of\r\nexceptions have their interest. If we are studying Greek accents, it is\r\ninteresting to know that _pais_ and _pas_, and some other monosyllables\r\nof the same form of declension, do not take the circumflex upon the last\r\nsyllable of the genitive plural, but vary, in this respect, from the\r\ncommon rule. If we are studying physiology, it is interesting to know\r\nthat the pulmonary artery carries dark blood and the pulmonary vein\r\ncarries bright blood, departing in this respect from the common rule for\r\nthe division of labour between the veins and the arteries. But every one\r\nknows how we seek naturally to combine the pieces of our knowledge\r\ntogether, to bring them under general rules, to relate them to\r\nprinciples; and how unsatisfactory and tiresome it would be to go on for\r\never learning lists of exceptions, or accumulating items of fact which\r\nmust stand isolated.\r\n\r\nWell, that same need of relating our knowledge, which operates here\r\nwithin the sphere of our knowledge itself, we shall find operating,\r\nalso, outside that sphere. We experience, as we go on learning and\r\nknowing,—the vast majority of us experience,—the need of relating what\r\nwe have learnt and known to the sense which we have in us for conduct,\r\nto the sense which we have in us for beauty.\r\n\r\nA certain Greek prophetess of Mantineia in Arcadia, Diotima by name,\r\nonce explained to the philosopher Socrates that love, and impulse, and\r\nbent of all kinds, is, in fact, nothing else but the desire in men that\r\ngood should for ever be present to them. This desire for good, Diotima\r\nassured Socrates, is our fundamental desire, of which fundamental desire\r\nevery impulse in us is only some one particular form. And therefore this\r\nfundamental desire it is, I suppose,—this desire in men that good\r\nshould be for ever present to them,—which acts in us when we feel the\r\nimpulse for relating our knowledge to our sense for conduct and to our\r\nsense for beauty. At any rate, with men in general the instinct exists.\r\nSuch is human nature. And the instinct, it will be admitted, is\r\ninnocent, and human nature is preserved by our following the lead of its\r\ninnocent instincts. Therefore, in seeking to gratify this instinct in\r\nquestion, we are following the instinct of self-preservation in\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nBut, no doubt, some kinds of knowledge cannot be made to directly serve\r\nthe instinct in question, cannot be directly related to the sense for\r\nbeauty, to the sense for conduct. These are instrument-knowledges; they\r\nlead on to other knowledges, which can. A man who passes his life in\r\ninstrument-knowledges is a specialist. They may be invaluable as\r\ninstruments to something beyond, for those who have the gift thus to\r\nemploy them; and they may be disciplines in themselves wherein it is\r\nuseful for every one to have some schooling. But it is inconceivable\r\nthat the generality of men should pass all their mental life with Greek\r\naccents or with formal logic. My friend Professor Sylvester, who is one\r\nof the first mathematicians in the world, holds transcendental doctrines\r\nas to the virtue of mathematics, but those doctrines are not for common\r\nmen. In the very Senate House and heart of our English Cambridge I once\r\nventured, though not without an apology for my profaneness, to hazard\r\nthe opinion that for the majority of mankind a little of mathematics,\r\neven, goes a long way. Of course this is quite consistent with their\r\nbeing of immense importance as an instrument to something else; but it\r\nis the few who have the aptitude for thus using them, not the bulk of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nThe natural sciences do not, however, stand on the same footing with\r\nthese instrument-knowledges. Experience shows us that the generality of\r\nmen will find more interest in learning that, when a taper burns, the\r\nwax is converted into carbonic acid and water, or in learning the\r\nexplanation of the phenomenon of dew, or in learning how the circulation\r\nof the blood is carried on, than they find in learning that the genitive\r\nplural of _pais_ and _pas_ does not take the circumflex on the\r\ntermination. And one piece of natural knowledge is added to another, and\r\nothers are added to that, and at last we come to propositions so\r\ninteresting as Mr. Darwin’s famous proposition that ‘our ancestor was a\r\nhairy quadruped furnished with a tail and pointed ears, probably\r\narboreal in his habits.’ Or we come to propositions of such reach and\r\nmagnitude as those which Professor Huxley delivers, when he says that\r\nthe notions of our forefathers about the beginning and the end of the\r\nworld were all wrong, and that nature is the expression of a definite\r\norder with which nothing interferes.\r\n\r\nInteresting, indeed, these results of science are, important they are,\r\nand we should all of us be acquainted with them. But what I now wish you\r\nto mark is, that we are still, when they are propounded to us and we\r\nreceive them, we are still in the sphere of intellect and knowledge. And\r\nfor the generality of men there will be found, I say, to arise, when\r\nthey have duly taken in the proposition that their ancestor was ‘a hairy\r\nquadruped furnished with a tail and pointed ears, probably arboreal in\r\nhis habits,’ there will be found to arise an invincible desire to relate\r\nthis proposition to the sense in us for conduct, and to the sense in us\r\nfor beauty. But this the men of science will not do for us, and will\r\nhardly even profess to do. They will give us other pieces of knowledge,\r\nother facts, about other animals and their ancestors, or about plants,\r\nor about stones, or about stars; and they may finally bring us to those\r\ngreat ‘general conceptions of the universe, which are forced upon us\r\nall,’ says Professor Huxley, ‘by the progress of physical science.’ But\r\nstill it will be _knowledge_ only which they give us; knowledge not put\r\nfor us into relation with our sense for conduct, our sense for beauty,\r\nand touched with emotion by being so put; not thus put for us, and\r\ntherefore, to the majority of mankind, after a certain while,\r\nunsatisfying, wearying.\r\n\r\nNot to the born naturalist, I admit. But what do we mean by a born\r\nnaturalist? We mean a man in whom the zeal for observing nature is so\r\nuncommonly strong and eminent, that it marks him off from the bulk of\r\nmankind. Such a man will pass his life happily in collecting natural\r\nknowledge and reasoning upon it, and will ask for nothing, or hardly\r\nanything, more. I have heard it said that the sagacious and admirable\r\nnaturalist whom we lost not very long ago, Mr. Darwin, once owned to a\r\nfriend that for his part he did not experience the necessity for two\r\nthings which most men find so necessary to them,—religion and poetry;\r\nscience and the domestic affections, he thought, were enough. To a born\r\nnaturalist, I can well understand that this should seem so. So absorbing\r\nis his occupation with nature, so strong his love for his occupation,\r\nthat he goes on acquiring natural knowledge and reasoning upon it, and\r\nhas little time or inclination for thinking about getting it related to\r\nthe desire in man for conduct, the desire in man for beauty. He relates\r\nit to them for himself as he goes along, so far as he feels the need;\r\nand he draws from the domestic affections all the additional solace\r\nnecessary. But then Darwins are extremely rare. Another great and\r\nadmirable master of natural knowledge, Faraday, was a Sandemanian. That\r\nis to say, he related his knowledge to his instinct for conduct and to\r\nhis instinct for beauty, by the aid of that respectable Scottish\r\nsectary, Robert Sandeman. And so strong, in general, is the demand of\r\nreligion and poetry to have their share in a man, to associate\r\nthemselves with his knowing, and to relieve and rejoice it, that,\r\nprobably, for one man amongst us with the disposition to do as Darwin\r\ndid in this respect, there are at least fifty with the disposition to do\r\nas Faraday.\r\n\r\nEducation lays hold upon us, in fact, by satisfying this demand.\r\nProfessor Huxley holds up to scorn mediæval education, with its neglect\r\nof the knowledge of nature, its poverty even of literary studies, its\r\nformal logic devoted to ‘showing how and why that which the Church said\r\nwas true must be true.’ But the great mediæval Universities were not\r\nbrought into being, we may be sure, by the zeal for giving a jejune and\r\ncontemptible education. Kings have been their nursing fathers, and\r\nqueens have been their nursing mothers, but not for this. The mediæval\r\nUniversities came into being, because the supposed knowledge, delivered\r\nby Scripture and the Church, so deeply engaged men’s hearts, by so\r\nsimply, easily, and powerfully relating itself to their desire for\r\nconduct, their desire for beauty. All other knowledge was dominated by\r\nthis supposed knowledge and was subordinated to it, because of the\r\nsurpassing strength of the hold which it gained upon the affections of\r\nmen, by allying itself profoundly with their sense for conduct, their\r\nsense for beauty.\r\n\r\nBut now, says Professor Huxley, conceptions of the universe fatal to the\r\nnotions held by our forefathers have been forced upon us by physical\r\nscience. Grant to him that they are thus fatal, that the new conceptions\r\nmust and will soon become current everywhere, and that every one will\r\nfinally perceive them to be fatal to the beliefs of our forefathers. The\r\nneed of humane letters, as they are truly called, because they serve the\r\nparamount desire in men that good should be for ever present to\r\nthem,—the need of humane letters, to establish a relation between the\r\nnew conceptions, and our instinct for beauty, our instinct for conduct,\r\nis only the more visible. The Middle Age could do without humane\r\nletters, as it could do without the study of nature, because its\r\nsupposed knowledge was made to engage its emotions so powerfully. Grant\r\nthat the supposed knowledge disappears, its power of being made to\r\nengage the emotions will of course disappear along with it,—but the\r\nemotions themselves, and their claim to be engaged and satisfied, will\r\nremain. Now if we find by experience that humane letters have an\r\nundeniable power of engaging the emotions, the importance of humane\r\nletters in a man’s training becomes not less, but greater, in proportion\r\nto the success of modern science in extirpating what it calls ‘mediæval\r\nthinking.’\r\n\r\nHave humane letters, then, have poetry and eloquence, the power here\r\nattributed to them of engaging the emotions, and do they exercise it?\r\nAnd if they have it and exercise it, _how_ do they exercise it, so as to\r\nexert an influence upon man’s sense for conduct, his sense for beauty?\r\nFinally, even if they both can and do exert an influence upon the senses\r\nin question, how are they to relate to them the results,—the modern\r\nresults,—of natural science? All these questions may be asked. First,\r\nhave poetry and eloquence the power of calling out the emotions? The\r\nappeal is to experience. Experience shows that for the vast majority of\r\nmen, for mankind in general, they have the power. Next do they exercise\r\nit? They do. But then, _how_ do they exercise it so as to affect man’s\r\nsense for conduct, his sense for beauty? And this is perhaps a case for\r\napplying the Preacher’s words: ‘Though a man labour to seek it out, yet\r\nhe shall not find it; yea, farther, though a wise man think to know it,\r\nyet shall he not be able to find it.’[3] Why should it be one thing, in\r\nits effect upon the emotions, to say, ‘Patience is a virtue,’ and quite\r\nanother thing, in its effect upon the emotions, to say with Homer,\r\n\r\n    τλητὸν γὰρ Μοῖραι θυμὸν θέσαν ἀνθρώποισιν—[4]\r\n\r\n‘for an enduring heart have the destinies appointed to the children of\r\nmen?’ Why should it be one thing, in its effect upon the emotions, to\r\nsay with the philosopher Spinoza, _Felicitas in eo consistit quod homo\r\nsuum esse conservare potest_—‘Man’s happiness consists in his being\r\nable to preserve his own essence,’ and quite another thing, in its\r\neffect upon the emotions, to say with the Gospel, ‘What is a man\r\nadvantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, forfeit\r\nhimself?’ How does this difference of effect arise? I cannot tell, and I\r\nam not much concerned to know; the important thing is that it does\r\narise, and that we can profit by it. But how, finally, are poetry and\r\neloquence to exercise the power of relating the modern results of\r\nnatural science to man’s instinct for conduct, his instinct for beauty?\r\nAnd here again I answer that I do not know how they will exercise it,\r\nbut that they can and will exercise it I am sure. I do not mean that\r\nmodern philosophical poets and modern philosophical moralists are to\r\ncome and relate for us, in express terms, the results of modern\r\nscientific research to our instinct for conduct, our instinct for\r\nbeauty. But I mean that we shall find, as a matter of experience, if we\r\nknow the best that has been thought and uttered in the world, we shall\r\nfind that the art and poetry and eloquence of men who lived, perhaps,\r\nlong ago, who had the most limited natural knowledge, who had the most\r\nerroneous conceptions about many important matters, we shall find that\r\nthis art, and poetry, and eloquence, have in fact not only the power of\r\nrefreshing and delighting us, they have also the power,—such is the\r\nstrength and worth, in essentials, of their authors’ criticism of\r\nlife,—they have a fortifying, and elevating, and quickening, and\r\nsuggestive power, capable of wonderfully helping us to relate the\r\nresults of modern science to our need for conduct, our need for beauty.\r\nHomer’s conceptions of the physical universe were, I imagine, grotesque;\r\nbut really, under the shock of hearing from modern science that ‘the\r\nworld is not subordinated to man’s use, and that man is not the cynosure\r\nof things terrestrial,’ I could, for my own part, desire no better\r\ncomfort than Homer’s line which I quoted just now,\r\n\r\n    τλητὸν γὰρ Μοῖραι θυμὸν θέσαν ἀνθρώποισιν—\r\n\r\n‘for an enduring heart have the destinies appointed to the children of\r\nmen!’\r\n\r\nAnd the more that men’s minds are cleared, the more that the results of\r\nscience are frankly accepted, the more that poetry and eloquence come to\r\nbe received and studied as what in truth they really are,—the criticism\r\nof life by gifted men, alive and active with extraordinary power at an\r\nunusual number of points;—so much the more will the value of humane\r\nletters, and of art also, which is an utterance having a like kind of\r\npower with theirs, be felt and acknowledged, and their place in\r\neducation be secured.\r\n\r\nLet us therefore, all of us, avoid indeed as much as possible any\r\ninvidious comparison between the merits of humane letters, as means of\r\neducation, and the merits of the natural sciences. But when some\r\nPresident of a Section for Mechanical Science insists on making the\r\ncomparison, and tells us that ‘he who in his training has substituted\r\nliterature and history for natural science has chosen the less useful\r\nalternative,’ let us make answer to him that the student of humane\r\nletters only, will, at least, know also the great general conceptions\r\nbrought in by modern physical science; for science, as Professor Huxley\r\nsays, forces them upon us all. But the student of the natural sciences\r\nonly, will, by our very hypothesis, know nothing of humane letters; not\r\nto mention that in setting himself to be perpetually accumulating\r\nnatural knowledge, he sets himself to do what only specialists have in\r\ngeneral the gift for doing genially. And so he will probably be\r\nunsatisfied, or at any rate incomplete, and even more incomplete than\r\nthe student of humane letters only.\r\n\r\nI once mentioned in a school-report, how a young man in one of our\r\nEnglish training colleges having to paraphrase the passage in _Macbeth_\r\nbeginning,\r\n\r\n    ‘Can’st thou not minister to a mind diseased?’\r\n\r\nturned this line into, ‘Can you not wait upon the lunatic?’ And I\r\nremarked what a curious state of things it would be, if every pupil of\r\nour national schools knew, let us say, that the moon is two thousand one\r\nhundred and sixty miles in diameter, and thought at the same time that a\r\ngood paraphrase for\r\n\r\n    ‘Can’st thou not minister to a mind diseased?’\r\n\r\nwas, ‘Can you not wait upon the lunatic?’ If one is driven to choose, I\r\nthink I would rather have a young person ignorant about the moon’s\r\ndiameter, but aware that ‘Can you not wait upon the lunatic?’ is bad,\r\nthan a young person whose education had been such as to manage things\r\nthe other way.\r\n\r\nOr to go higher than the pupils of our national schools. I have in my\r\nmind’s eye a member of our British Parliament who comes to travel here\r\nin America, who afterwards relates his travels, and who shows a really\r\nmasterly knowledge of the geology of this great country and of its\r\nmining capabilities, but who ends by gravely suggesting that the United\r\nStates should borrow a prince from our Royal Family, and should make him\r\ntheir king, and should create a House of Lords of great landed\r\nproprietors after the pattern of ours; and then America, he thinks,\r\nwould have her future happily and perfectly secured. Surely, in this\r\ncase, the President of the Section for Mechanical Science would himself\r\nhardly say that our member of Parliament, by concentrating himself upon\r\ngeology and mineralogy, and so on, and not attending to literature and\r\nhistory, had ‘chosen the more useful alternative.’\r\n\r\nIf then there is to be separation and option between humane letters on\r\nthe one hand, and the natural sciences on the other, the great majority\r\nof mankind, all who have not exceptional and overpowering aptitudes for\r\nthe study of nature, would do well, I cannot but think, to choose to be\r\neducated in humane letters rather than in the natural sciences. Letters\r\nwill call out their being at more points, will make them live more.\r\n\r\nI said that before I ended I would just touch on the question of\r\nclassical education, and I will keep my word. Even if literature is to\r\nretain a large place in our education, yet Latin and Greek, say the\r\nfriends of progress, will certainly have to go. Greek is the grand\r\noffender in the eyes of these gentlemen. The attackers of the\r\nestablished course of study think that against Greek, at any rate, they\r\nhave irresistible arguments. Literature may perhaps be needed in\r\neducation, they say; but why on earth should it be Greek literature? Why\r\nnot French or German? Nay, ‘has not an Englishman models in his own\r\nliterature of every kind of excellence?’ As before, it is not on any\r\nweak pleadings of my own that I rely for convincing the gainsayers; it\r\nis on the constitution of human nature itself, and on the instinct of\r\nself-preservation in humanity. The instinct for beauty is set in human\r\nnature, as surely as the instinct for knowledge is set there, or the\r\ninstinct for conduct. If the instinct for beauty is served by Greek\r\nliterature and art as it is served by no other literature and art, we\r\nmay trust to the instinct of self-preservation in humanity for keeping\r\nGreek as part of our culture. We may trust to it for even making the\r\nstudy of Greek more prevalent than it is now. Greek will come, I hope,\r\nsome day to be studied more rationally than at present; but it will be\r\nincreasingly studied as men increasingly feel the need in them for\r\nbeauty, and how powerfully Greek art and Greek literature can serve this\r\nneed. Women will again study Greek, as Lady Jane Grey did; I believe\r\nthat in that chain of forts, with which the fair host of the Amazons are\r\nnow engirdling our English universities, I find that here in America, in\r\ncolleges like Smith College in Massachusetts, and Vassar College in the\r\nState of New York, and in the happy families of the mixed universities\r\nout West, they are studying it already.\r\n\r\n_Defuit una mihi symmetria prisca_,—‘The antique symmetry was the one\r\nthing wanting to me,’ said Leonardo da Vinci; and he was an Italian. I\r\nwill not presume to speak for the Americans, but I am sure that, in the\r\nEnglishman, the want of this admirable symmetry of the Greeks is a\r\nthousand times more great and crying than in any Italian. The results of\r\nthe want show themselves most glaringly, perhaps, in our architecture,\r\nbut they show themselves, also, in all our art. _Fit details strictly\r\ncombined, in view of a large general result nobly conceived;_ that is\r\njust the beautiful _symmetria prisca_ of the Greeks, and it is just\r\nwhere we English fail, where all our art fails. Striking ideas we have,\r\nand well-executed details we have; but that high symmetry which, with\r\nsatisfying and delightful effect, combines them, we seldom or never\r\nhave. The glorious beauty of the Acropolis at Athens did not come from\r\nsingle fine things stuck about on that hill, a statue here, a gateway\r\nthere;—no, it arose from all things being perfectly combined for a\r\nsupreme total effect. What must not an Englishman feel about our\r\ndeficiencies in this respect, as the sense for beauty, whereof this\r\nsymmetry is an essential element, awakens and strengthens within him!\r\nwhat will not one day be his respect and desire for Greece and its\r\n_symmetria prisca_, when the scales drop from his eyes as he walks the\r\nLondon streets, and he sees such a lesson in meanness as the Strand, for\r\ninstance, in its true deformity! But here we are coming to our friend\r\nMr. Ruskin’s province, and I will not intrude upon it, for he is its\r\nvery sufficient guardian.\r\n\r\nAnd so we at last find, it seems, we find flowing in favour of the\r\nhumanities the natural and necessary stream of things, which seemed\r\nagainst them when we started. The ‘hairy quadruped furnished with a tail\r\nand pointed ears, probably arboreal in his habits,’ this good fellow\r\ncarried hidden in his nature, apparently, something destined to develop\r\ninto a necessity for humane letters. Nay, more; we seem finally to be\r\neven led to the further conclusion that our hairy ancestor carried in\r\nhis nature, also, a necessity for Greek.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore, to say the truth, I cannot really think that humane\r\nletters are in much actual danger of being thrust out from their leading\r\nplace in education, in spite of the array of authorities against them at\r\nthis moment. So long as human nature is what it is, their attractions\r\nwill remain irresistible. As with Greek, so with letters generally: they\r\nwill some day come, we may hope, to be studied more rationally, but they\r\nwill not lose their place. What will happen will rather be that there\r\nwill be crowded into education other matters besides, far too many;\r\nthere will be, perhaps, a period of unsettlement and confusion and false\r\ntendency; but letters will not in the end lose their leading place. If\r\nthey lose it for a time, they will get it back again. We shall be\r\nbrought back to them by our wants and aspirations. And a poor humanist\r\nmay possess his soul in patience, neither strive nor cry, admit the\r\nenergy and brilliancy of the partisans of physical science, and their\r\npresent favour with the public, to be far greater than his own, and\r\nstill have a happy faith that the nature of things works silently on\r\nbehalf of the studies which he loves, and that, while we shall all have\r\nto acquaint ourselves with the great results reached by modern science,\r\nand to give ourselves as much training in its disciplines as we can\r\nconveniently carry, yet the majority of men will always require humane\r\nletters; and so much the more, as they have the more and the greater\r\nresults of science to relate to the need in man for conduct, and to the\r\nneed in him for beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  EMERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nForty years ago, when I was an undergraduate at Oxford, voices were in\r\nthe air there which haunt my memory still. Happy the man who in that\r\nsusceptible season of youth hears such voices! they are a possession to\r\nhim for ever. No such voices as those which we heard in our youth at\r\nOxford are sounding there now. Oxford has more criticism now, more\r\nknowledge, more light; but such voices as those of our youth it has no\r\nlonger. The name of Cardinal Newman is a great name to the imagination\r\nstill; his genius and his style are still things of power. But he is\r\nover eighty years old; he is in the Oratory at Birmingham; he has\r\nadopted, for the doubts and difficulties which beset men’s minds to-day,\r\na solution which, to speak frankly, is impossible. Forty years ago he\r\nwas in the very prime of life; he was close at hand to us at Oxford; he\r\nwas preaching in St. Mary’s pulpit every Sunday; he seemed about to\r\ntransform and to renew what was for us the most national and natural\r\ninstitution in the world, the Church of England. Who could resist the\r\ncharm of that spiritual apparition, gliding in the dim afternoon light\r\nthrough the aisles of St. Mary’s, rising into the pulpit, and then, in\r\nthe most entrancing of voices, breaking the silence with words and\r\nthoughts which were a religious music,—subtle, sweet, mournful? I seem\r\nto hear him still, saying: ‘After the fever of life, after wearinesses\r\nand sicknesses, fightings and despondings, languor and fretfulness,\r\nstruggling and succeeding; after all the changes and chances of this\r\ntroubled, unhealthy state,—at length comes death, at length the white\r\nthrone of God, at length the beatific vision.’ Or, if we followed him\r\nback to his seclusion at Littlemore, that dreary village by the London\r\nroad, and to the house of retreat and the church which he built\r\nthere,—a mean house such as Paul might have lived in when he was\r\ntent-making at Ephesus, a church plain and thinly sown with\r\nworshippers,—who could resist him there either, welcoming back to the\r\nsevere joys of church-fellowship, and of daily worship and prayer, the\r\nfirstlings of a generation which had well-nigh forgotten them? Again I\r\nseem to hear him: ‘The season is chill and dark, and the breath of the\r\nmorning is damp, and worshippers are few; but all this befits those who\r\nare by their profession penitents and mourners, watchers and pilgrims.\r\nMore dear to them that loneliness, more cheerful that severity, and more\r\nbright that gloom, than all those aids and appliances of luxury by which\r\nmen nowadays attempt to make prayer less disagreeable to them. True\r\nfaith does not covet comforts; they who realise that awful day, when\r\nthey shall see Him face to face whose eyes are as a flame of fire, will\r\nas little bargain to pray pleasantly now as they will think of doing so\r\nthen.’\r\n\r\nSomewhere or other I have spoken of those ‘last enchantments of the\r\nMiddle Age’ which Oxford sheds around us, and here they were! But there\r\nwere other voices sounding in our ear besides Newman’s. There was the\r\npuissant voice of Carlyle; so sorely strained, over-used, and mis-used\r\nsince, but then fresh, comparatively sound, and reaching our hearts with\r\ntrue, pathetic eloquence. Who can forget the emotion of receiving in its\r\nfirst freshness such a sentence as that sentence of Carlyle upon Edward\r\nIrving, then just dead: ‘Scotland sent him forth a herculean man; our\r\nmad Babylon wore and wasted him with all her engines,—and it took her\r\ntwelve years!’ A greater voice still,—the greatest voice of the\r\ncentury,—came to us in those youthful years through Carlyle: the voice\r\nof Goethe. To this day,—such is the force of youthful associations,—I\r\nread the _Wilhelm Meister_ with more pleasure in Carlyle’s translation\r\nthan in the original. The large, liberal view of human life in _Wilhelm\r\nMeister_, how novel it was to the Englishman in those days! and it was\r\nsalutary, too, and educative for him, doubtless, as well as novel. But\r\nwhat moved us most in _Wilhelm Meister_ was that which, after all, will\r\nalways move the young most,—the poetry, the eloquence. Never, surely,\r\nwas Carlyle’s prose so beautiful and pure as in his rendering of the\r\nYouths’ dirge over Mignon!—‘Well is our treasure now laid up, the fair\r\nimage of the past. Here sleeps it in the marble, undecaying; in your\r\nhearts, also, it lives, it works. Travel, travel, back into life! Take\r\nalong with you this holy earnestness, for earnestness alone makes life\r\neternity.’ Here we had the voice of the great Goethe;—not the stiff,\r\nand hindered, and frigid, and factitious Goethe who speaks to us too\r\noften from those sixty volumes of his, but of the great Goethe, and the\r\ntrue one.\r\n\r\nAnd besides those voices, there came to us in that old Oxford time a\r\nvoice also from this side of the Atlantic,—a clear and pure voice,\r\nwhich for my ear, at any rate, brought a strain as new, and moving, and\r\nunforgettable, as the strain of Newman, or Carlyle, or Goethe. Mr.\r\nLowell has well described the apparition of Emerson to your young\r\ngeneration here, in that distant time of which I am speaking, and of his\r\nworkings upon them. He was your Newman, your man of soul and genius\r\nvisible to you in the flesh, speaking to your bodily ears, a present\r\nobject for your heart and imagination. That is surely the most potent of\r\nall influences! nothing can come up to it. To us at Oxford Emerson was\r\nbut a voice speaking from three thousand miles away. But so well he\r\nspoke, that from that time forth Boston Bay and Concord were names\r\ninvested to my ear with a sentiment akin to that which invests for me\r\nthe names of Oxford and of Weimar; and snatches of Emerson’s strain\r\nfixed themselves in my mind as imperishably as any of the eloquent words\r\nwhich I have been just now quoting. ‘Then dies the man in you; then once\r\nmore perish the buds of art, poetry, and science, as they have died\r\nalready in a thousand thousand men.’ ‘What Plato has thought, he may\r\nthink; what a saint has felt, he may feel; what at any time has befallen\r\nany man, he can understand.’ ‘Trust thyself! every heart vibrates to\r\nthat iron string. Accept the place the Divine Providence has found for\r\nyou, the society of your contemporaries, the connexion of events. Great\r\nmen have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius\r\nof their age; betraying their perception that the Eternal was stirring\r\nat their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their\r\nbeing. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest spirit the\r\nsame transcendent destiny; and not pinched in a corner, not cowards\r\nfleeing before a revolution, but redeemers and benefactors, pious\r\naspirants to be noble clay plastic under the Almighty effort, let us\r\nadvance and advance on chaos and the dark!’ These lofty sentences of\r\nEmerson, and a hundred others of like strain, I never have lost out of\r\nmy memory; I never _can_ lose them.\r\n\r\nAt last I find myself in Emerson’s own country, and looking upon Boston\r\nBay. Naturally I revert to the friend of my youth. It is not always\r\npleasant to ask oneself questions about the friends of one’s youth; they\r\ncannot always well support it. Carlyle, for instance, in my judgment,\r\ncannot well support such a return upon him. Yet we should make the\r\nreturn; we should part with our illusions, we should know the truth.\r\nWhen I come to this country, where Emerson now counts for so much, and\r\nwhere such high claims are made for him, I pull myself together, and ask\r\nmyself what the truth about this object of my youthful admiration really\r\nis. Improper elements often come into our estimate of men. We have\r\nlately seen a German critic make Goethe the greatest of all poets,\r\nbecause Germany is now the greatest of military powers, and wants a poet\r\nto match. Then, too, America is a young country; and young countries,\r\nlike young persons, are apt sometimes to evince in their literary\r\njudgments a want of scale and measure. I set myself, therefore,\r\nresolutely to come at a real estimate of Emerson, and with a leaning\r\neven to strictness rather than to indulgence. That is the safer course.\r\nTime has no indulgence; any veils of illusion which we may have left\r\naround an object because we loved it, Time is sure to strip away.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nI was reading the other day a notice of Emerson by a serious and\r\ninteresting American critic. Fifty or sixty passages in Emerson’s poems,\r\nsays this critic,—who had doubtless himself been nourished on Emerson’s\r\nwritings, and held them justly dear,—fifty or sixty passages from\r\nEmerson’s poems have already entered into English speech as matter of\r\nfamiliar and universally current quotation. Here is a specimen of that\r\npersonal sort of estimate which, for my part, even in speaking of\r\nauthors dear to me, I would try to avoid. What is the kind of phrase of\r\nwhich we may fairly say that it has entered into English speech as\r\nmatter of familiar quotation? Such a phrase, surely, as the ‘Patience on\r\na monument’ of Shakespeare; as the ‘Darkness visible’ of Milton; as the\r\n‘Where ignorance is bliss’ of Gray. Of not one single passage in\r\nEmerson’s poetry can it be truly said that it has become a familiar\r\nquotation like phrases of this kind. It is not enough that it should be\r\nfamiliar to his admirers, familiar in New England, familiar even\r\nthroughout the United States; it must be familiar to all readers and\r\nlovers of English poetry. Of not more than one or two passages in\r\nEmerson’s poetry can it, I think, be truly said, that they stand\r\never-present in the memory of even many lovers of English poetry. A\r\ngreat number of passages from his poetry are no doubt perfectly familiar\r\nto the mind and lips of the critic whom I have mentioned, and perhaps of\r\na wide circle of American readers. But this is a very different thing\r\nfrom being matter of universal quotation, like the phrases of the\r\nlegitimate poets.\r\n\r\nAnd, in truth, one of the legitimate poets, Emerson, in my opinion, is\r\nnot. His poetry is interesting, it makes one think; but it is not the\r\npoetry of one of the born poets. I say it of him with reluctance,\r\nalthough I am sure that he would have said it of himself; but I say it\r\nwith reluctance, because I dislike giving pain to his admirers, and\r\nbecause all my own wish, too, is to say of him what is favourable. But I\r\nregard myself, not as speaking to please Emerson’s admirers, not as\r\nspeaking to please myself; but rather, I repeat, as communing with Time\r\nand Nature concerning the productions of this beautiful and rare spirit,\r\nand as resigning what of him is by their unalterable decree touched with\r\ncaducity, in order the better to mark and secure that in him which is\r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\nMilton says that poetry ought to be simple, sensuous, impassioned. Well,\r\nEmerson’s poetry is seldom either simple, or sensuous, or impassioned.\r\nIn general it lacks directness; it lacks concreteness; it lacks energy.\r\nHis grammar is often embarrassed; in particular, the want of\r\nclearly-marked distinction between the subject and the object of his\r\nsentence is a frequent cause of obscurity in him. A poem which shall be\r\na plain, forcible, inevitable whole he hardly ever produces. Such good\r\nwork as the noble lines graven on the Concord Monument is the exception\r\nwith him; such ineffective work as the ’Fourth of July Ode’ or the\r\n‘Boston Hymn’ is the rule. Even passages and single lines of thorough\r\nplainness and commanding force are rare in his poetry. They exist, of\r\ncourse; but when we meet with them they give us a slight shock of\r\nsurprise, so little has Emerson accustomed us to them. Let me have the\r\npleasure of quoting one or two of these exceptional passages:—\r\n\r\n   ‘So nigh is grandeur to our dust,\r\n      So near is God to man,\r\n    When Duty whispers low, _Thou must_,\r\n      The youth replies, _I can_.’\r\n\r\nOr again this:—\r\n\r\n   ‘Though love repine and reason chafe,\r\n    There came a voice without reply:\r\n    “’Tis man’s perdition to be safe,\r\n    When for the truth he ought to die.”’\r\n\r\nExcellent! but how seldom do we get from him a strain blown so clearly\r\nand firmly! Take another passage where his strain has not only\r\nclearness, it has also grace and beauty:—\r\n\r\n   ‘And ever, when the happy child\r\n    In May beholds the blooming wild,\r\n    And hears in heaven the bluebird sing,\r\n    “Onward,” he cries, “your baskets bring!\r\n    In the next field is air more mild,\r\n    And in yon hazy west is Eden’s balmier spring.”’\r\n\r\nIn the style and cadence here there is a reminiscence, I think, of Gray;\r\nat any rate the pureness, grace, and beauty of these lines are worthy\r\neven of Gray. But Gray holds his high rank as a poet, not merely by the\r\nbeauty and grace of passages in his poems; not merely by a diction\r\ngenerally pure in an age of impure diction: he holds it, above all, by\r\nthe power and skill with which the evolution of his poems is conducted.\r\nHere is his grand superiority to Collins, whose diction in his best\r\npoem, the ‘Ode to Evening,’ is purer than Gray’s; but then the ‘Ode to\r\nEvening’ is like a river which loses itself in the sand, whereas Gray’s\r\nbest poems have an evolution sure and satisfying. Emerson’s ‘Mayday,’\r\nfrom which I just now quoted, has no real evolution at all; it is a\r\nseries of observations. And, in general, his poems have no evolution.\r\nTake, for example, his ‘Titmouse.’ Here he has an excellent subject; and\r\nhis observation of Nature, moreover, is always marvellously close and\r\nfine. But compare what he makes of his meeting with his titmouse with\r\nwhat Cowper or Burns makes of the like kind of incident! One never quite\r\narrives at learning what the titmouse actually did for him at all,\r\nthough one feels a strong interest and desire to learn it; but one is\r\nreduced to guessing, and cannot be quite sure that after all one has\r\nguessed right. He is not plain and concrete enough,—in other words, not\r\npoet enough,—to be able to tell us. And a failure of this kind goes\r\nthrough almost all his verse, keeps him amid symbolism and allusion and\r\nthe fringes of things, and, in spite of his spiritual power, deeply\r\nimpairs his poetic value. Through the inestimable virtue of\r\nconcreteness, a simple poem like ‘The Bridge’ of Longfellow, or the\r\n‘School Days’ of Mr. Whittier, is of more poetic worth, perhaps, than\r\nall the verse of Emerson.\r\n\r\nI do not, then, place Emerson among the great poets. But I go further,\r\nand say that I do not place him among the great writers, the great men\r\nof letters. Who are the great men of letters? They are men like Cicero,\r\nPlato, Bacon, Pascal, Swift, Voltaire,—writers with, in the first\r\nplace, a genius and instinct for style; writers whose prose is by a kind\r\nof native necessity true and sound. Now the style of Emerson, like the\r\nstyle of his transcendentalist friends and of the ‘Dial’ so\r\ncontinually,—the style of Emerson is capable of falling into a strain\r\nlike this, which I take from the beginning of his ‘Essay on Love’:\r\n‘Every soul is a celestial being to every other soul. The heart has its\r\nsabbaths and jubilees, in which the world appears as a hymeneal feast,\r\nand all natural sounds and the circle of the seasons are erotic odes and\r\ndances.’ Emerson altered this sentence in the later editions. Like\r\nWordsworth, he was in later life fond of altering; and in general his\r\nlater alterations, like those of Wordsworth, are not improvements. He\r\nsoftened the passage in question, however, though without really mending\r\nit. I quote it in its original and strongly-marked form. Arthur Stanley\r\nused to relate that about the year 1840, being in conversation with some\r\nAmericans in quarantine at Malta, and thinking to please them, he\r\ndeclared his warm admiration for Emerson’s ‘Essays,’ then recently\r\npublished. However, the Americans shook their heads, and told him that\r\nfor home taste Emerson was decidedly too _greeny_. We will hope, for\r\ntheir sakes, that the sort of thing they had in their heads was such\r\nwriting as I have just quoted. Unsound it is, indeed, and in a style\r\nalmost impossible to a born man of letters.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious thing, that quality of style which marks the great\r\nwriter, the born man of letters. It resides in the whole tissue of his\r\nwork, and of his work regarded as a composition for literary purposes.\r\nBrilliant and powerful passages in a man’s writings do not prove his\r\npossession of it; it lies in their whole tissue. Emerson has passages of\r\nnoble and pathetic eloquence, such as those which I quoted at the\r\nbeginning; he has passages of shrewd and felicitous wit; he has crisp\r\nepigram; he has passages of exquisitely touched observation of nature.\r\nYet he is not a great writer; his style has not the requisite wholeness\r\nof good tissue. Even Carlyle is not, in my judgment, a great writer. He\r\nhas surpassingly powerful qualities of expression, far more powerful\r\nthan Emerson’s, and reminding one of the gifts of expression of the\r\ngreat poets,—of even Shakespeare himself. What Emerson so admirably\r\nsays of Carlyle’s ‘devouring eyes and pourtraying hand,’ ‘those thirsty\r\neyes, those portrait-eating, portrait-painting eyes of thine, those\r\nfatal perceptions,’ is thoroughly true. What a description is Carlyle’s\r\nof the first publisher of _Sartor Resartus_, ‘to whom the idea of a new\r\nedition of _Sartor_ is frightful, or rather ludicrous, unimaginable’; of\r\nthis poor Fraser, in whose ‘wonderful world of Tory pamphleteers,\r\nconservative Younger-brothers, Regent Street loungers, Crockford\r\ngamblers, Irish Jesuits, drunken reporters, and miscellaneous unclean\r\npersons (whom nitre and much soap will not wash clean), not a soul has\r\nexpressed the smallest wish that way!’ What a portrait, again, of the\r\nwell-beloved John Sterling! ‘One, and the best, of a small class extant\r\nhere, who, nigh drowning in a black wreck of Infidelity (lighted up by\r\nsome glare of Radicalism only, now growing _dim_ too), and about to\r\nperish, saved themselves into a Coleridgian Shovel-Hattedness.’ What\r\ntouches in the invitation of Emerson to London! ‘You shall see\r\nblockheads by the million; Pickwick himself shall be visible,—innocent\r\nyoung Dickens, reserved for a questionable fate. The great Wordsworth\r\nshall talk till you yourself pronounce him to be a bore. Southey’s\r\ncomplexion is still healthy mahogany brown, with a fleece of white hair,\r\nand eyes that seem running at full gallop. Leigh Hunt, man of genius in\r\nthe shape of a cockney, is my near neighbour, with good humour and no\r\ncommon-sense; old Rogers with his pale head, white, bare, and cold as\r\nsnow, with those large blue eyes, cruel, sorrowful, and that sardonic\r\nshelf chin.’ How inimitable it all is! And finally, for one must not go\r\non for ever, this version of a London Sunday, with the public-houses\r\nclosed during the hours of divine service! ‘It is silent Sunday; the\r\npopulace not yet admitted to their beer-shops, till the respectabilities\r\nconclude their rubric mummeries,—a much more audacious feat than beer.’\r\nYet even Carlyle is not, in my judgment, to be called a great writer;\r\none cannot think of ranking him with men like Cicero and Plato and Swift\r\nand Voltaire. Emerson freely promises to Carlyle immortality for his\r\nhistories. They will not have it. Why? Because the materials furnished\r\nto him by that devouring eye of his, and that pourtraying hand, were not\r\nwrought in and subdued by him to what his work, regarded as a\r\ncomposition for literary purposes, required. Occuring in conversation,\r\nbreaking out in familiar correspondence, they are magnificent,\r\ninimitable; nothing more is required of them; thus thrown out anyhow,\r\nthey serve their turn and fulfil their function. And, therefore, I\r\nshould not wonder if really Carlyle lived, in the long run, by such an\r\ninvaluable record as that correspondence between him and Emerson, of\r\nwhich we owe the publication to Mr. Charles Norton,—by this and not by\r\nhis works, as Johnson lives in Boswell, not by his works. For Carlyle’s\r\nsallies, as the staple of a literary work, become wearisome; and as time\r\nmore and more applies to Carlyle’s works its stringent test, this will\r\nbe felt more and more. Shakespeare, Molière, Swift,—they, too, had,\r\nlike Carlyle, the devouring eye and the pourtraying hand. But they are\r\ngreat literary masters, they are supreme writers, because they knew how\r\nto work into a literary composition their materials, and to subdue them\r\nto the purposes of literary effect. Carlyle is too wilful for this, too\r\nturbid, too vehement.\r\n\r\nYou will think I deal in nothing but negatives. I have been saying that\r\nEmerson is not one of the great poets, the great writers. He has not\r\ntheir quality of style. He is, however, the propounder of a philosophy.\r\nThe Platonic dialogues afford us the example of exquisite literary form\r\nand treatment given to philosophical ideas. Plato is at once a great\r\nliterary man and a great philosopher.\r\n\r\nIf we speak carefully, we cannot call Aristotle or Spinoza or Kant great\r\nliterary men, or their productions great literary works. But their work\r\nis arranged with such constructive power that they build a philosophy,\r\nand are justly called great philosophical writers. Emerson cannot, I\r\nthink, be called with justice a great philosophical writer. He cannot\r\nbuild; his arrangement of philosophical ideas has no progress in it, no\r\nevolution; he does not construct a philosophy. Emerson himself knew the\r\ndefects of his method, or rather want of method, very well; indeed, he\r\nand Carlyle criticise themselves and one another in a way which leaves\r\nlittle for any one else to do in the way of formulating their defects.\r\nCarlyle formulates perfectly the defects of his friend’s poetic and\r\nliterary production when he says of the ‘Dial’: ‘For me it is too\r\nethereal, speculative, theoretic; I will have all things condense\r\nthemselves, take shape and body, if they are to have my sympathy.’ And,\r\nspeaking of Emerson’s orations, he says: ‘I long to see some concrete\r\nThing, some Event, Man’s Life, American Forest, or piece of Creation,\r\nwhich this Emerson loves and wonders at, well _Emersonised_,—depictured\r\nby Emerson, filled with the life of Emerson, and cast forth from him,\r\nthen to live by itself. If these orations balk me of this, how\r\nprofitable soever they may be for others, I will not love them.’ Emerson\r\nhimself formulates perfectly the defect of his own philosophical\r\nproductions when he speaks of his ‘formidable tendency to the lapidary\r\nstyle. I build my house of boulders.’ ‘Here I sit and read and write,’\r\nhe says again, ‘with very little system, and, as far as regards\r\ncomposition, with the most fragmentary result; paragraphs\r\nincompressible, each sentence an infinitely repellent particle.’ Nothing\r\ncan be truer; and the work of a Spinoza or Kant, of the men who stand as\r\ngreat philosophical writers, does not proceed in this wise.\r\n\r\nSome people will tell you that Emerson’s poetry, indeed, is too\r\nabstract, and his philosophy too vague, but that his best work is his\r\n_English Traits_. The _English Traits_ are beyond question very pleasant\r\nreading. It is easy to praise them, easy to commend the author of them.\r\nBut I insist on always trying Emerson’s work by the highest standards. I\r\nesteem him too much to try his work by any other. Tried by the highest\r\nstandards, and compared with the work of the excellent markers and\r\nrecorders of the traits of human life,—of writers like Montaigne, La\r\nBruyère, Addison,—the _English Traits_ will not stand the comparison.\r\nEmerson’s observation has not the disinterested quality of the\r\nobservation of these masters. It is the observation of a man\r\nsystematically benevolent, as Hawthorne’s observation in _Our Old Home_\r\nis the work of a man chagrined. Hawthorne’s literary talent is of the\r\nfirst order. His subjects are generally not to me subjects of the\r\nhighest interest; but his literary talent is of the first order, the\r\nfinest, I think, which America has yet produced,—finer, by much, than\r\nEmerson’s. Yet _Our Old Home_ is not a masterpiece any more than\r\n_English Traits_. In neither of them is the observer disinterested\r\nenough. The author’s attitude in each of these cases can easily be\r\nunderstood and defended. Hawthorne was a sensitive man, so situated in\r\nEngland that he was perpetually in contact with the British Philistine;\r\nand the British Philistine is a trying personage. Emerson’s systematic\r\nbenevolence comes from what he himself calls somewhere his ‘persistent\r\noptimism’; and his persistent optimism is the root of his greatness and\r\nthe source of his charm. But still let us keep our literary conscience\r\ntrue, and judge every kind of literary work by the laws really proper to\r\nit. The kind of work attempted in the _English Traits_ and in _Our Old\r\nHome_ is work which cannot be done perfectly with a bias such as that\r\ngiven by Emerson’s optimism or by Hawthorne’s chagrin. Consequently,\r\nneither _English Traits_ nor _Our Old Home_ is a work of perfection in\r\nits kind.\r\n\r\nNot with the Miltons and Grays, not with the Platos and Spinozas, not\r\nwith the Swifts and Voltaires, not with the Montaignes and Addisons, can\r\nwe rank Emerson. His work of various kinds, when one compares it with\r\nthe work done in a corresponding kind by these masters, fails to stand\r\nthe comparison. No man could see this clearer than Emerson himself. It\r\nis hard not to feel despondency when we contemplate our failures and\r\nshortcomings: and Emerson, the least self-flattering and the most modest\r\nof men, saw so plainly what was lacking to him that he had his moments\r\nof despondency. ‘Alas, my friend,’ he writes in reply to Carlyle, who\r\nhad exhorted him to creative work,—‘Alas, my friend, I can do no such\r\ngay thing as you say. I do not belong to the poets, but only to a low\r\ndepartment of literature,—the reporters; suburban men.’ He deprecated\r\nhis friend’s praise; praise ‘generous to a fault,’ he calls it; praise\r\n‘generous to the shaming of me,—cold, fastidious, ebbing person that I\r\nam. Already in a former letter you had said too much good of my poor\r\nlittle arid book, which is as sand to my eyes. I can only say that I\r\nheartily wish the book were better; and I must try and deserve so much\r\nfavour from the kind gods by a bolder and truer living in the months to\r\ncome,—such as may perchance one day release and invigorate this cramp\r\nhand of mine. When I see how much work is to be done; what room for a\r\npoet, for any spiritualist, in this great, intelligent, sensual, and\r\navaricious America,—I lament my fumbling fingers and stammering\r\ntongue.’ Again, as late as 1870, he writes to Carlyle: ‘There is no\r\nexample of constancy like yours, and it always stings my stupor into\r\ntemporary recovery and wonderful resolution to accept the noble\r\nchallenge. But “the strong hours conquer us;” and I am the victim of\r\nmiscellany,—miscellany of designs, vast debility, and procrastination.’\r\nThe forlorn note belonging to the phrase, ‘vast debility,’ recalls that\r\nsaddest and most discouraged of writers, the author of _Obermann_,\r\nSenancour, with whom Emerson has in truth a certain kinship. He has, in\r\ncommon with Senancour, his pureness, his passion for nature, his single\r\neye; and here we find him confessing, like Senancour, a sense in himself\r\nof sterility and impotence.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nAnd now I think I have cleared the ground. I have given up to envious\r\nTime as much of Emerson as Time can fairly expect ever to obtain. We\r\nhave not in Emerson a great poet, a great writer, a great\r\nphilosophy-maker. His relation to us is not that of one of those\r\npersonages; yet it is a relation of, I think, even superior importance.\r\nHis relation to us is more like that of the Roman Emperor Marcus\r\nAurelius. Marcus Aurelius is not a great writer, a great\r\nphilosophy-maker; he is the friend and aider of those who would live in\r\nthe spirit. Emerson is the same. He is the friend and aider of those who\r\nwould live in the spirit. All the points in thinking which are necessary\r\nfor this purpose he takes; but he does not combine them into a system,\r\nor present them as a regular philosophy. Combined in a system by a man\r\nwith the requisite talent for this kind of thing, they would be less\r\nuseful than as Emerson gives them to us; and the man with the talent so\r\nto systematise them would be less impressive than Emerson. They do very\r\nwell as they now stand;—like ‘boulders,’ as he says;—in ‘paragraphs\r\nincompressible, each sentence an infinitely repellent particle.’ In such\r\nsentences his main points recur again and again, and become fixed in the\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nWe all know them. First and foremost, character. Character is\r\neverything. ‘That which all things tend to educe,—which freedom,\r\ncultivation, intercourse, revolutions, go to form and deliver,—is\r\ncharacter.’ Character and self-reliance. ‘Trust thyself! every heart\r\nvibrates to that iron string.’ And yet we have our being in a _not\r\nourselves_. ‘There is a power above and behind us, and we are the\r\nchannels of its communications.’ But our lives must be pitched higher.\r\n‘Life must be lived on a higher plane; we must go up to a higher\r\nplatform, to which we are always invited to ascend; there the whole\r\nscene changes.’ The good we need is for ever close to us, though we\r\nattain it not. ‘On the brink of the waters of life and truth, we are\r\nmiserably dying.’ This good is close to us, moreover, in our daily life,\r\nand in the familiar, homely places. ‘The unremitting retention of simple\r\nand high sentiments in obscure duties,—that is the maxim for us. Let us\r\nbe poised and wise, and our own to-day. Let us treat the men and women\r\nwell,—treat them as if they were real; perhaps they are. Men live in\r\ntheir fancy, like drunkards whose hands are too soft and tremulous for\r\nsuccessful labour. I settle myself ever firmer in the creed, that we\r\nshould not postpone and refer and wish, but do broad justice where we\r\nare, by whomsoever we deal with; accepting our actual companions and\r\ncircumstances, however humble or odious, as the mystic officials to whom\r\nthe universe has delegated its whole pleasure for us. Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut River, and Boston Bay, you think paltry places, and the ear\r\nloves names of foreign and classic topography. But here we are; and if\r\nwe will tarry a little we may come to learn that here is best. See to it\r\nonly that thyself is here.’ Furthermore, the good is close to us _all_.\r\n‘I resist the scepticism of our education and of our educated men. I do\r\nnot believe that the differences of opinion and character in men are\r\norganic. I do not recognise, besides the class of the good and the wise,\r\na permanent class of sceptics, or a class of conservatives, or of\r\nmalignants, or of materialists. I do not believe in the classes. Every\r\nman has a call of the power to do something unique.’ Exclusiveness is\r\ndeadly. ‘The exclusive in social life does not see that he excludes\r\nhimself from enjoyment in the attempt to appropriate it. The\r\nexclusionist in religion does not see that he shuts the door of heaven\r\non himself in striving to shut out others. Treat men as pawns and\r\nninepins, and you shall suffer as well as they. If you leave out their\r\nheart you shall lose your own: The selfish man suffers more from his\r\nselfishness than he from whom that selfishness withholds some important\r\nbenefit.’ A sound nature will be inclined to refuse ease and\r\nself-indulgence. ‘To live with some rigour of temperance, or some\r\nextreme of generosity, seems to be an asceticism which common\r\ngood-nature would appoint to those who are at ease and in plenty, in\r\nsign that they feel a brotherhood with the great multitude of suffering\r\nmen.’ Compensation, finally, is the great law of life; it is everywhere,\r\nit is sure, and there is no escape from it. This is that ‘law alive and\r\nbeautiful, which works over our heads and under our feet. Pitiless, it\r\navails itself of our success when we obey it, and of our ruin when we\r\ncontravene it. We are all secret believers in it. It rewards actions\r\nafter their nature. The reward of a thing well done is to have done it.\r\nThe thief steals from himself, the swindler swindles himself. You must\r\npay at last your own debt.’\r\n\r\nThis is tonic indeed! And let no one object that it is too general; that\r\nmore practical, positive direction is what we want; that Emerson’s\r\noptimism, self-reliance, and indifference to favourable conditions for\r\nour life and growth have in them something of danger. ‘Trust thyself;’\r\n‘what attracts my attention shall have it;’ ‘though thou shouldst walk\r\nthe world over thou shalt not be able to find a condition inopportune or\r\nignoble;’ ‘what we call vulgar society is that society whose poetry is\r\nnot yet written, but which you shall presently make as enviable and\r\nrenowned as any.’ With maxims like these, we surely, it may be said, run\r\nsome risk of being made too well satisfied with our own actual self and\r\nstate, however crude and imperfect they may be. ‘Trust thyself?’ It may\r\nbe said that the common American or Englishman is more than enough\r\ndisposed already to trust himself. I often reply, when our sectarians\r\nare praised for following conscience: Our people are very good in\r\nfollowing their conscience; where they are not so good is in\r\nascertaining whether their conscience tells them right. ‘What attracts\r\nmy attention shall have it?’ Well, that is our people’s plea when they\r\nrun after the Salvation Army, and desire Messrs. Moody and Sankey. ‘Thou\r\nshalt not be able to find a condition inopportune or ignoble?’ But think\r\nof the turn of the good people of our race for producing a life of\r\nhideousness and immense ennui; think of that specimen of your own New\r\nEngland life which Mr. Howells gives us in one of his charming stories\r\nwhich I was reading lately; think of the life of that ragged New England\r\nfarm in the _Lady of the Aroostook_; think of Deacon Blood, and Aunt\r\nMaria, and the straight-backed chairs with black horse-hair seats, and\r\nEzra Perkins with perfect self-reliance depositing his travellers in the\r\nsnow! I can truly say that in the little which I have seen of the life\r\nof New England, I am more struck with what has been achieved than with\r\nthe crudeness and failure. But no doubt there is still a great deal of\r\ncrudeness also. Your own novelists say there is, and I suppose they say\r\ntrue. In the New England, as in the Old, our people have to learn, I\r\nsuppose, not that their modes of life are beautiful and excellent\r\nalready; they have rather to learn that they must transform them.\r\n\r\nTo adopt this line of objection to Emerson’s deliverances would,\r\nhowever, be unjust. In the first place, Emerson’s points are in\r\nthemselves true, if understood in a certain high sense; they are true\r\nand fruitful. And the right work to be done, at the hour when he\r\nappeared, was to affirm them generally and absolutely. Only thus could\r\nhe break through the hard and fast barrier of narrow, fixed ideas, which\r\nhe found confronting him, and win an entrance for new ideas. Had he\r\nattempted developments which may now strike us as expedient, he would\r\nhave excited fierce antagonism, and probably effected little or nothing.\r\nThe time might come for doing other work later, but the work which\r\nEmerson did was the right work to be done then.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, strong as was Emerson’s optimism, and unconquerable\r\nas was his belief in a good result to emerge from all which he saw going\r\non around him, no misanthropical satirist ever saw shortcomings and\r\nabsurdities more clearly than he did, or exposed them more courageously.\r\nWhen he sees ‘the meanness,’ as he calls it, ‘of American politics,’ he\r\ncongratulates Washington on being ‘long already happily dead,’ on being\r\n‘wrapt in his shroud and for ever safe.’ With how firm a touch he\r\ndelineates the faults of your two great political parties of forty years\r\nago! The Democrats, he says, ‘have not at heart the ends which give to\r\nthe name of democracy what hope and virtue are in it. The spirit of our\r\nAmerican radicalism is destructive and aimless; it is not loving; it has\r\nno ulterior and divine ends, but is destructive only out of hatred and\r\nselfishness. On the other side, the conservative party, composed of the\r\nmost moderate, able, and cultivated part of the population, is timid,\r\nand merely defensive of property. It vindicates no right, it aspires to\r\nno real good, it brands no crime, it proposes no generous policy. From\r\nneither party, when in power, has the world any benefit to expect in\r\nscience, art, or humanity, at all commensurate with the resources of the\r\nnation.’ Then with what subtle though kindly irony he follows the\r\ngradual withdrawal in New England, in the last half century, of tender\r\nconsciences from the social organisations,—the bent for experiments\r\nsuch as that of Brook Farm and the like,—follows it in all its\r\n‘dissidence of dissent and Protestantism of the Protestant religion!’ He\r\neven loves to rally the New Englander on his philanthropical activity,\r\nand to find his beneficence and its institutions a bore! ‘Your\r\nmiscellaneous popular charities, the education at college of fools, the\r\nbuilding of meeting-houses to the vain end to which many of these now\r\nstand, alms to sots, and the thousand-fold relief societies,—though I\r\nconfess with shame that I sometimes succumb and give the dollar, yet it\r\nis a wicked dollar, which by and by I shall have the manhood to\r\nwithhold.’ ‘Our Sunday schools and churches and pauper societies are\r\nyokes to the neck. We pain ourselves to please nobody. There are natural\r\nways of arriving at the same ends at which these aim, but do not\r\narrive.’ ‘Nature does not like our benevolence or our learning much\r\nbetter than she likes our frauds and wars. When we come out of the\r\ncaucus, or the bank, or the Abolition convention, or the Temperance\r\nmeeting, or the Transcendental club, into the fields and woods, she says\r\nto us: “So hot, my little sir?”’\r\n\r\nYes, truly, his insight is admirable; his truth is precious. Yet the\r\nsecret of his effect is not even in these; it is in his temper. It is in\r\nthe hopeful, serene, beautiful temper wherewith these, in Emerson, are\r\nindissolubly joined; in which they work, and have their being. He says\r\nhimself: ‘We judge of a man’s wisdom by his hope, knowing that the\r\nperception of the inexhaustibleness of nature is an immortal youth.’ If\r\nthis be so, how wise is Emerson! for never had man such a sense of the\r\ninexhaustibleness of nature, and such hope. It was the ground of his\r\nbeing; it never failed him. Even when he is sadly avowing the\r\nimperfection of his literary power and resources, lamenting his fumbling\r\nfingers and stammering tongue, he adds: ‘Yet, as I tell you, I am very\r\neasy in my mind and never dream of suicide. My whole philosophy, which\r\nis very real, teaches acquiescence and optimism. Sure I am that the\r\nright word will be spoken, though I cut out my tongue.’ In his old age,\r\nwith friends dying and life failing, his tone of cheerful,\r\nforward-looking hope is still the same. ‘A multitude of young men are\r\ngrowing up here of high promise, and I compare gladly the social poverty\r\nof my youth with the power on which these draw.’ His abiding word for\r\nus, the word by which being dead he yet speaks to us, is this: ‘That\r\nwhich befits us, embosomed in beauty and wonder as we are, is\r\ncheerfulness and courage, and the endeavour to realise our aspirations.\r\nShall not the heart, which has received so much, trust the Power by\r\nwhich it lives?’\r\n\r\nOne can scarcely overrate the importance of thus holding fast to\r\nhappiness and hope. It gives to Emerson’s work an invaluable virtue. As\r\nWordsworth’s poetry is, in my judgment, the most important work done in\r\nverse, in our language, during the present century, so Emerson’s\r\n_Essays_ are, I think, the most important work done in prose. His work\r\nis more important than Carlyle’s. Let us be just to Carlyle, provoking\r\nthough he often is. Not only has he that genius of his which makes\r\nEmerson say truly of his letters, that ‘they savour always of eternity.’\r\nMore than this may be said of him. The scope and upshot of his teaching\r\nare true; ‘his guiding genius,’ to quote Emerson again, is really ‘his\r\nmoral sense, his perception of the sole importance of truth and\r\njustice.’ But consider Carlyle’s temper, as we have been considering\r\nEmerson’s! take his own account of it! ‘Perhaps London is the proper\r\nplace for me after all, seeing all places are _im_proper: who knows?\r\nMeanwhile, I lead a most dyspeptic, solitary, self-shrouded life;\r\nconsuming, if possible in silence, my considerable daily allotment of\r\npain; glad when any strength is left in me for writing, which is the\r\nonly use I can see in myself,—too rare a case of late. The ground of my\r\nexistence is black as death; too black, when all _void_ too; but at\r\ntimes there paint themselves on it pictures of gold, and rainbow, and\r\nlightning; all the brighter for the black ground, I suppose. Withal, I\r\nam very much of a fool.’—No, not a fool, but turbid and morbid, wilful\r\nand perverse. ‘We judge of a man’s wisdom by his hope.’\r\n\r\nCarlyle’s perverse attitude towards happiness cuts him off from hope. He\r\nfiercely attacks the desire for happiness; his grand point in _Sartor_,\r\nhis secret in which the soul may find rest, is that one shall cease to\r\ndesire happiness, that one should learn to say to oneself: ‘What if thou\r\nwert born and predestined not to be happy, but to be unhappy!’ He is\r\nwrong; Saint Augustine is the better philosopher, who says: ‘Act we\r\n_must_ in pursuance of what gives us most delight.’ Epictetus and\r\nAugustine can be severe moralists enough; but both of them know and\r\nfrankly say that the desire for happiness is the root and ground of\r\nman’s being. Tell him and show him that he places his happiness wrong,\r\nthat he seeks for delight where delight will never be really found; then\r\nyou illumine and further him. But you only confuse him by telling him to\r\ncease to desire happiness; and you will not tell him this unless you are\r\nalready confused yourself.\r\n\r\nCarlyle preached the dignity of labour, the necessity of righteousness,\r\nthe love of veracity, the hatred of shams. He is said by many people to\r\nbe a great teacher, a great helper for us, because he does so. But what\r\nis the due and eternal result of labour, righteousness,\r\nveracity?—Happiness. And how are we drawn to them by one who, instead\r\nof making us feel that with them is happiness, tells us that perhaps we\r\nwere predestined not to be happy but to be unhappy?\r\n\r\nYou will find, in especial, many earnest preachers of our popular\r\nreligion to be fervent in their praise and admiration of Carlyle. His\r\ninsistence on labour, righteousness, and veracity, pleases them; his\r\ncontempt for happiness pleases them too. I read the other day a tract\r\nagainst smoking, although I do not happen to be a smoker myself.\r\n‘Smoking,’ said the tract, ‘is liked because it gives agreeable\r\nsensations. Now it is a positive objection to a thing that it gives\r\nagreeable sensations. An earnest man will expressly avoid what gives\r\nagreeable sensations.’ Shortly afterwards I was inspecting a school, and\r\nI found the children reading a piece of poetry on the common theme that\r\nwe are here to-day and gone to-morrow. I shall soon be gone, the speaker\r\nin this poem was made to say,—\r\n\r\n   ‘And I shall be glad to go,\r\n    For the world at best is a dreary place,\r\n    And my life is getting low.’\r\n\r\nHow usual a language of popular religion that is, on our side of the\r\nAtlantic at any rate! But then our popular religion, in disparaging\r\nhappiness here below, knows very well what it is after. It has its eye\r\non a happiness in a future life above the clouds, in the New Jerusalem,\r\nto be won by disliking and rejecting happiness here on earth. And so\r\nlong as this ideal stands fast, it is very well. But for very many it\r\nnow stands fast no longer; for Carlyle, at any rate, it had failed and\r\nvanished. Happiness in labour, righteousness, and veracity,—in the life\r\nof the spirit,—here was a gospel still for Carlyle to preach, and to\r\nhelp others by preaching. But he baffled them and himself by preferring\r\nthe paradox that we are not born for happiness at all.\r\n\r\nHappiness in labour, righteousness, and veracity; in all the life of the\r\nspirit; happiness and eternal hope;—that was Emerson’s gospel. I hear\r\nit said that Emerson was too sanguine; that the actual generation in\r\nAmerica is not turning out so well as he expected. Very likely he was\r\ntoo sanguine as to the near future; in this country it is difficult not\r\nto be too sanguine. Very possibly the present generation may prove\r\nunworthy of his high hopes; even several generations succeeding this may\r\nprove unworthy of them. But by his conviction that in the life of the\r\nspirit is happiness, and by his hope that this life of the spirit will\r\ncome more and more to be sanely understood, and to prevail, and to work\r\nfor happiness,—by this conviction and hope Emerson was great, and he\r\nwill surely prove in the end to have been right in them. In this country\r\nit is difficult, as I said, not to be sanguine. Very many of your\r\nwriters are over-sanguine, and on the wrong grounds. But you have two\r\nmen who in what they have written show their sanguineness in a line\r\nwhere courage and hope are just, where they are also infinitely\r\nimportant, but where they are not easy. The two men are Franklin and\r\nEmerson.[5] These two are, I think, the most distinctively and\r\nhonourably American of your writers; they are the most original and the\r\nmost valuable. Wise men everywhere know that we must keep up our courage\r\nand hope; they know that hope is, as Wordsworth well says,—\r\n\r\n   ‘The paramount _duty_ which Heaven lays,\r\n    For its own honour, on man’s suffering heart.’\r\n\r\nBut the very word _duty_ points to an effort and a struggle to maintain\r\nour hope unbroken. Franklin and Emerson maintained theirs with a\r\nconvincing ease, an inspiring joy. Franklin’s confidence in the\r\nhappiness with which industry, honesty, and economy will crown the life\r\nof this work-day world, is such that he runs over with felicity. With a\r\nlike felicity does Emerson run over, when he contemplates the happiness\r\neternally attached to the true life in the spirit. You cannot prize him\r\ntoo much, nor heed him too diligently. He has lessons for both the\r\nbranches of our race. I figure him to my mind as visible upon earth\r\nstill, as still standing here by Boston Bay, or at his own Concord, in\r\nhis habit as he lived, but of heightened stature and shining feature,\r\nwith one hand stretched out towards the East, to our laden and labouring\r\nEngland; the other towards the ever-growing West, to his own\r\ndearly-loved America,—‘great, intelligent, sensual, avaricious\r\nAmerica.’ To us he shows for guidance his lucid freedom, his\r\ncheerfulness and hope; to you his dignity, delicacy, serenity,\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Printed by R. & R. Clark, Edinburgh._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Footnotes]\r\n\r\n1. _Philippians_, iv, 8.\r\n\r\n2. Ὅσα σεμνά.\r\n\r\n3. _Ecclesiastes_, viii. 17.\r\n\r\n4. _Iliad_, xxiv. 49.\r\n\r\n5. I found with pleasure that this conjunction of Emerson’s name with\r\nFranklin’s had already occurred to an accomplished writer and delightful\r\nman, a friend of Emerson, left almost the sole survivor, alas! of the\r\nfamous literary generation of Boston,—Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes. Dr.\r\nHolmes has kindly allowed me to print here the ingenious and interesting\r\nlines, hitherto unpublished, in which he speaks of Emerson thus:—\r\n\r\n   ‘Where in the realm of thought, whose air is song,\r\n    Does he, the Buddha of the West, belong?\r\n    He seems a wingéd Franklin, sweetly wise,\r\n    Born to unlock the secret of the skies;\r\n    And which the nobler calling—if ’tis fair\r\n    Terrestrial with celestial to compare—\r\n    To guide the storm-cloud’s elemental flame,\r\n    Or walk the chambers whence the lightning came\r\n    Amidst the sources of its subtile fire,\r\n    And steal their effluence for his lips and lyre?’",
