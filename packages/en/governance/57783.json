CORBETT,\r\n  In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first edition of the COLORADO LEGISLATIVE MANUAL is herewith\r\npresented. While designed for the use of the General Assembly, it cannot\r\nfail to interest all classes--the lawyer, the merchant, the aspirant\r\nafter political honors, and even the young who are ripening into manhood\r\nand soon to share its grave responsibilities. It contains information\r\nwhich cannot be elsewhere acquired without a great expenditure of time\r\nand patience, in the examination of records, the reconciliation of\r\nnumerous discrepancies, the supplement of omissions and the correction\r\nof errors. The pre-State history is necessarily brief. Sketches of\r\nprominent characters, and comments on events and the acts of individuals\r\nare not introduced, for the reason that the period of the narrative\r\nshould be removed some distance from the present age to secure the\r\nhistorian from undue prejudice and partiality. The settlement of\r\nColorado, now a flourishing State, began scarcely twenty years ago. A\r\nsense of propriety, therefore, demands that only a plain, accurate and\r\ntruthful statement be made of what occurred in connection with that\r\nsettlement. In the preparation of the Legislative Annals, much labor and\r\ncare have been expended. The Annals are as complete and correct as it\r\nwas possible to make them, considering the removals of members from the\r\nTerritory, the inaccuracy of the records and the imperfection of the\r\njournals. To the novice in legislation, the Manual of Customs,\r\nPrecedents and Forms will prove of great value. I have sought, and\r\nindeed have spared no pains nor expense, to make this an improvement\r\nupon all other Legislative Manuals yet published.\r\n\r\nThis Manual will be published _biennially_ with such changes as\r\ncircumstances may require, and such improvements as experience may\r\nsuggest. That I am anxious to receive the commendation of an\r\nappreciative public, I do not deny, and hope that their fullest sympathy\r\nwith my effort in this direction will be freely accorded. It is a\r\nsatisfaction to know, and should beget a praiseworthy pride, that\r\nColorado is not behind any of the oldest, most populous and wealthy\r\nStates in the character, style and completeness of this publication.\r\n\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to confess, that from the inception to the\r\ncompletion of this work, I have received much kind and cordial\r\nassistance. My warmest thanks and acknowledgments are extended to Robert\r\nBerry and William W. Webster, experienced legislators, for their good\r\noffices and valuable help. The courtesies of Judge Amos Steck, whose\r\nmemory of facts, dates and persons deserves special mention, and the\r\nkindness of O. J. Goldrick, editor and proprietor of the _Rocky Mountain\r\nHerald_, are here gratefully acknowledged.\r\n\r\nTrusting that this work will meet the expectations of the General\r\nAssembly, and State at large, I respectfully submit it to their\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n  T.

The province extended from the\r\npossessions of New Spain on the south, to the boundary line of the\r\nBritish possessions on the north, and had the magnificent Mississippi\r\nriver on the one side, and the great Pacific Ocean on the other. At the\r\nclose of the Mexican war, in 1848, by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,\r\nfor the sum of $15,000,000, all New Mexico and Upper California--a\r\nregion extending from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, and containing\r\nabout 500,000 square miles--was ceded to the United States. This immense\r\ndomain, thus acquired by purchase from France and Mexico, has been\r\noccupied by an intelligent and enterprising population, and divided into\r\nstates and territories, each an empire in its dimensions, and has been\r\ncultivated, developed, and embellished by all the arts and inventions of\r\nthe most progressed civilization. One portion of this domain is\r\nColorado, destined by her position, resources and climate to enjoy an\r\nimmortal precedence among the States of our great Republic.\r\n\r\nBefore the year 1858 very little was known of Colorado. It is recorded,\r\nwith some apparent truth, that a large force of Spaniards and Indian\r\nallies, led by Coronado, a Spanish military captain, having for their\r\nobject the discovery of gold, had, about the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, penetrated to this section of the Rocky Mountains. The\r\nexpedition, after incredible hardships, returned without the golden\r\ntreasures, for which they had ventured so far and suffered so much.\r\n\r\nSoon after the transfer of the Louisiana province, and the establishment\r\nof the United States authority therein, it was determined at Washington\r\nto ascertain the nature of the country, the sources of its large rivers\r\nand the general character of the climate. Accordingly, in the summer of\r\n1806, a small expedition was equipped, and dispatched under the command\r\nof Lieutenant Zebulon M. Pike, who, for his skillful services, was, on\r\nhis return, promoted to the rank of major. On the 15th of November,\r\nMajor Pike and his small company beheld the prominent and stately\r\nmountain which, in honor of the commander, was named Pike’s Peak. Major\r\nPike, in his diary, thus refers to this peak: “This mountain was so\r\nremarkable as to be known to all the savage nations for hundreds of\r\nmiles around, and to be spoken of with admiration by the Spaniards of\r\nNew Mexico, and was the bounds of their travels north-west.” Directing\r\nhis march with the course of the mountains, Major Pike continued his\r\nexplorations. Failing to discover the object of his search--the source\r\nof the Red River--he retraced his steps, and proceeded in a\r\nsouth-westerly direction. Determined to find the head-waters of that\r\nimportant stream, and unconquered by the fearful severities of winter in\r\nthe midst of the mountains, the little party of explorers pursued their\r\nway. Their discoveries were, however, brought to a close by an untoward\r\nevent--the capture of the whole party by the Spaniards, who held a\r\nmilitary post in the San Juan country. This arrest would hardly have\r\noccurred had the boundaries between New Spain and Louisiana been\r\ndefinitely known.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1819 another and larger expedition was prepared, and ordered\r\nto explore this section of the Rocky Mountains. The party engaged in\r\nthis enterprise had advanced a considerable distance into the Indian\r\ncountry without molestation, when its further progress was checked by\r\nthe loss of their horses, which had been stolen by the Pawnee Indians.\r\nThis mischance detained the expedition for a whole year. In June, 1820,\r\nCol. S. H. Long, the commander, all losses having been repaired, resumed\r\nhis march. Early in the summer they reached the South Platte, and\r\nfollowed its course until the mountains came in sight. The massive giant\r\npeak, which stood out boldly and grandly before them, was, in honor of\r\nCol. Long, called Long’s Peak. Col. Long made a careful examination of\r\nthe mountains from Long’s Peak to Pike’s Peak, and of the plains lying\r\nalong their base.\r\n\r\nA very full exploration of the Rocky Mountains was made, in 1832, by\r\nCaptain Bonneville, who commanded a party fitted out by the American Fur\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nThe most effective expedition hitherto equipped by the Government, for\r\npurposes of exploration, was commanded by Col. Fremont, and set out in\r\n1842. Upon his arrival at the South Platte, he sent the larger portion\r\nof his force to Fort Laramie, a post of the American Fur Company. With\r\nthe rest of his command he advanced to Fort St. Vrain, an Indian trading\r\npost, situated seventeen miles east from Long’s Peak, and one hundred\r\nmiles north from Pike’s Peak. From this point he journeyed northward,\r\nexploring the country beyond the limits of Colorado.\r\n\r\nAnother band of explorers, conducted by Col. Fremont, camped at Fort St.\r\nVrain in July, 1843. This party made accurate surveys of the regions\r\nknown as north and south of the Divide--an elevated ridge, separating\r\nthe Arkansas and Platte valleys; crossed and re-crossed the range,\r\nascertained many valuable facts, and mapped out the main geographical\r\nfeatures of Colorado. But, so far, none of these explorers, nor any of\r\nthe white inhabitants, mostly occupied in trading, trapping and hunting,\r\nhad made any discovery of the vast mineral wealth now known to exist in\r\nthis portion of the Sierra Madre mountains.\r\n\r\nAs the limits of Kansas formerly embraced a large part of what now\r\nconstitutes Colorado, a brief summary of the early history of Kansas is\r\nessential. The territory of Kansas was organized on the thirtieth day of\r\nMay, 1854. Then began her pupilage under the guardianship of Congress.\r\nIn theory, the relation of a territory to the national government is\r\nthat of a child to its parent. It is supposed to be under discipline and\r\ntraining, by which it will, in due time, be fitted to discharge the high\r\nand important duties incident to statehood. Kansas, it seems, was an\r\nunruly ward, and caused much trouble and anxiety to her guardian. In the\r\nOrganic Act of the territory it was prescribed that the Constitution and\r\nall the laws of the United States should be in full force and effect,\r\nexcept the Missouri Compromise Act of 1820, which was declared to be\r\ninoperative and void in that territory. The Missouri Compromise, thus\r\npartially rescinded, opened the way for a pro-slavery and an\r\nanti-slavery agitation. Anti-slavery colonies from New England, and\r\npro-slavery colonies from the Southern States, came to settle in the new\r\nterritory of Kansas. Confusion, riot, and bloodshed soon followed. This\r\nunhappy state of affairs continued until the adoption of a State\r\nconstitution prohibiting slavery. This important event occurred December\r\n6th, 1859. From that time peace and order reigned. On January 29th,\r\n1861, an Act for the admission of Kansas into the Union as a state,\r\npassed both Houses of Congress. On February 26th, 1861, Congress divided\r\nthe new state, and organized the western portion into a territory\r\nbearing the name of Colorado.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Kansas became a territory in 1854. From that year\r\nuntil 1858 no one authorized to represent the territory of Kansas\r\nappeared within the present limits of Colorado. The inhabitants before\r\nthis time, beside the employees of the American Fur Company and a few\r\nindependent trappers, hunters, and Indian traders, consisted of a\r\nscattered population of Pueblos and Mexicans, mostly engaged in stock\r\nraising in the vicinity of the Raton Mountains, and the roving tribes of\r\nsavages. The Indian traders, among whom were Lieutenant Lupton and Vigil\r\nSt. Vrain in the north, and Colonels Boone and Bent in the south, had\r\nerected small forts to shield them from the savages. The junction of the\r\nFontaine qui Bouille with the Arkansas was a favorite winter rendezvous\r\nfor the trappers and hunters, among whom was the famous Kit Carson. In\r\n1854, the Ute Indians massacred, in one night, all who had assembled at\r\nthis resort. Hitherto the protection of Kansas power and law had never\r\nbeen invoked, nor had the needs of the scanty and motley population\r\noccupied the attention of the Kansas government. In 1852 a party of\r\nCherokee Indians, on their way from Georgia to California, discovered\r\ngold on the banks of a small stream tributary to the South Platte. On\r\ntheir return journey they showed the gold and reported the place of\r\ndiscovery. Exciting rumors of gold found in large quantities in the\r\nRocky Mountains, inflamed thousands with the desire to reach and possess\r\nthe open treasures. The first train of prospectors, led by W. Green\r\nRussell, Esq., started from Georgia. As they passed through Missouri and\r\nKansas, the gold fever influenced many to leave home and competency for\r\nthe distant plains and mountains teeming with riches. The Georgians took\r\nup their position where Denver now stands, and thoroughly prospected\r\nCherry Creek from its mouth to its source, but as their labors were\r\npoorly rewarded, they gave the Platte, of which Cherry Creek is a\r\ntributary, a fair trial for six or seven miles south. Much disappointed,\r\nthey set out for the North Platte and Green River regions, but faring\r\nworse, returned to their first location, and were made happy by larger\r\nreturns for their labor. The first Kansas party built their camp fires\r\nnear the present site of Pueblo. As the news of gold discoveries sped\r\nacross the continent, a strong tide of emigration set in to the Pike’s\r\nPeak country. Strings of wagons and troops of men, in constant\r\nsuccession, kept crossing the great plains, anxious as they toiled on,\r\nto catch a glimpse of the blue outlines of the mountains, where fortune\r\nstood waiting to enrich the hardy adventurers. From all parts, and\r\nembracing all characters, poured in the earnest crowd, all animated by a\r\ncommon hope of attaining sudden wealth.\r\n\r\nJ. W. Denver, after whom Denver, the present capital of Colorado, was\r\ncalled, was then governor of Kansas territory. But neither he, nor his\r\nsuccessor Medary, nor even Robinson, elected State governor December\r\n6th, 1859, could give scarcely any attention to occurrences in the\r\ndistant Pike’s Peak gold regions. Their thoughts and time were almost\r\nentirely engrossed by political events at home.\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the Platte, near the present Younker ranch, some of the\r\nKansas company, who had camped on the Arkansas, with others, began to\r\nerect a number of log cabins. These were soon completed, and the name of\r\nMontana City was applied to the settlement. In these cabins a large\r\nparty of prospectors spent the winter. On the 24th of September, a party\r\nof nine selected the east side of Cherry Creek, near its mouth, for a\r\ntown site, and agreed to lay out 640 acres for that purpose. The\r\npeculiar and pious name of St. Charles was given to it, but no steps\r\nwere taken to survey and plot the town or put up buildings, unless a few\r\nlogs crossed together, with an old wagon cover for a roof, might be\r\ndesignated a house. Another company chose the west side of Cherry Creek\r\nfor a town site, and in the latter part of October proceeded to\r\nconstruct some log cabins. These, and a number of others used as stores,\r\nwere built, and the town called Auraria, from a small mining town in\r\nGeorgia. The prospects of this new enterprise soon became encouraging,\r\nwhile Montana City in time lost its inhabitants, and its tenements went\r\nto ruin. A town company, composed mainly of Kansas citizens, on November\r\n17th, 1858, took possession of the deserted St. Charles town site. Steps\r\nfor the erection of cabins were immediately taken in order to secure the\r\nright of pre-emption. By New Year’s Day Denver had twenty and Auraria\r\nforty cabins. Up to this time the settlements contained only three white\r\nwomen. In the fall of 1859, a warm rivalry existed between Auraria and\r\nDenver. This was manifested in every issue, and continued until the\r\nconsolidation of Denver and Auraria in 1860. The first inhabitants of\r\nBoulder came to that section October 17, 1858. In the summer of 1859\r\nsettlements were made in South Park. In the autumn months of 1859\r\nMountain City, Boulder, Russellville, Colorado City, Golden and Arapahoe\r\nbecame large settlements.\r\n\r\nAs the population increased, protection of life and property was felt as\r\nthe special need. Animated, therefore, by a common desire to establish\r\nsecurity, prevent and punish crime, the new settlers called a public\r\nmeeting. The meeting was held November 6, 1858, in the settlement of\r\nAuraria, containing at that time about 200 inhabitants. The assembly,\r\nthough composed of immigrants from different states, acted as citizens\r\nof Kansas territory. Out of the Pike’s Peak country, as that part of the\r\nRocky Mountains, and the plains around their base, were called, they\r\nformed a county, defined its limits, and named it Arapahoe, from a\r\nneighboring tribe of Indians. They also declared Auraria to be the\r\ncounty seat. They then proceeded to elect a delegate to Congress and a\r\nrepresentative to the Kansas Legislature. H. J. Graham was chosen\r\ndelegate, and A. J. Smith representative. This action of the assembly\r\nmanifested a rare spirit of enterprise in politics. They declare a\r\ndistrict of Kansas to be a county, and depute one of their number to the\r\nlegislature with credentials of his election, and petitions that the\r\ncounty be established, and their representative be received. At the same\r\ntime a delegate is dispatched to Congress with instructions to have the\r\ncounty converted into a territory. The delegate of _Kansas_ Territory\r\nwould be duly recognized and admitted to a seat in Congress. But to the\r\ndelegate of Arapahoe county no such recognition or position would be\r\ntendered. His labors would be confined to the advocacy of the petitions\r\nand claims of the people he represented before committees, or with\r\nindividual members of the House or Senate. Nevertheless, Mr. Graham\r\nhurried to Washington, impelled by the delusive hope that his mission\r\nwould be successful, and that he would enjoy the honors and emoluments\r\nof territorial delegate. The people of Arapahoe county were 700 miles\r\ndistant from Leavenworth, the capital of Kansas, without railroads or\r\ntelegraphs, and with immense uninhabited plains lying between them and\r\nthe territorial authorities. They, therefore, naturally desired to have\r\nthe territory of Kansas divided, and the western part organized into a\r\nnew territory. This arrangement, if consummated, would place the country\r\non a stable footing. Peace and order would be maintained, the general\r\nprosperity promoted, while Congress and the nation would be directly\r\nacquainted with the growth, prospects and necessities of the country.\r\nMr. Graham exerted himself to prevail on Congress to respect the\r\npetition of his constituents, but his efforts proved unsuccessful. Their\r\nrepresentative, A. J. Smith, succeeded in his mission, had Arapahoe\r\ncounty confirmed, but was not admitted as a member of the Kansas\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1858 the population was only slightly increased.\r\nThe settlements were governed by local laws, devised and adopted by the\r\npeople, and these laws were executed by a Probate judge and other\r\nofficers, of the people’s appointment. The first election of Arapahoe\r\ncounty officers, under Kansas laws, was held March 28, 1859. Over 700\r\nvotes were polled, of which 231 were credited to Auraria and 144 to\r\nDenver. The spring months brought a great increase to the mining\r\npopulation. From authentic sources it has been computed that, during the\r\nsummer, the Pike’s Peak gold regions contained 20,000 souls. An\r\nestablished and accessible government became indispensable. The subject\r\npressed itself more and more urgently on the public mind. Their first\r\nattempt, in 1858, to impress Congress favorably with the necessities of\r\ntheir situation, had proved abortive. But a profound sense of their\r\nneeds moved them to renew their efforts to prevail on Congress to\r\nconsummate a partition of the territory of Kansas, and to establish a\r\nseparate government in this distant but populous region. A mass meeting\r\nwas called, to convene in Auraria, April 11th, 1859. In the resolutions\r\nadopted, it was expressed as the unanimous sentiment of the meeting,\r\nthat a separate and distinct government was not only important but\r\nnecessary. By these resolutions, also, the several precincts of Arapahoe\r\ncounty were requested to choose delegates, to meet in joint convention\r\non the fourth day after the meeting, April 15th, to consider the\r\nquestion of organizing a new state or territory. On the day appointed\r\nthe delegates met. In order to save time and determine quickly, they\r\npursued an eminently judicious course. They resolved on one subject of\r\ndebate, and only one: “The formation of a new and independent state of\r\nthe Union.” It must be remembered that Kansas, at this time, was only a\r\nterritory, though pressing her claims for recognition and admission as a\r\nState. Thus early, and prematurely, as facts subsequently proved, did\r\nthe people, who crowded into this new country, seek for the honors and\r\nprivileges of statehood. While these delegates were in session, or\r\nshortly after, the _Rocky Mountain News_, the pioneer journal of\r\nColorado, issued its first edition, April 23d, 1859. This Auraria\r\nconvention, as a summing up of their labors, ordered a general election\r\nof delegates on the second Monday in May, to meet on the first Monday in\r\nJune. At the time designated fifty delegates assembled. As in the April\r\nconvention, only one subject, it seems, engaged their deliberations--the\r\nattainment of statehood. The work of drafting a constitution was\r\nentrusted to eight committees, in order to economize time and secure a\r\ncomplete instrument. The committees were requested to report, and submit\r\ntheir labors to a fuller convention, which was enjoined to meet on the\r\nfirst Monday in August. In the interval the several committees prepared\r\ntheir work. When the convention, which consisted of one hundred and\r\nsixty-seven delegates, met, the committees presented their reports. A\r\nconstitution was completed, and arrangements made for its acceptance or\r\nrejection by the votes of the people. Though some members of the\r\nconvention were sanguine of success, the majority thought that the\r\nresult would be adverse, and sought to provide against such a\r\ncontingency. The day set for voting on the constitution and movement for\r\na state, was the first Monday in September. The convention therefore\r\nresolved that should the constitution be rejected, a delegate to\r\nCongress should be elected on the first Monday in October. The delegate\r\nwould represent Jefferson Territory--the name given by the convention to\r\nArapahoe county, or Pike’s Peak gold regions. On September 4th the votes\r\nfar or against the constitution were cast, and resulted in 2,007\r\nagainst, and 649 for, that instrument. A short time (about ten days)\r\nbefore the October election, it was proposed, at a mass meeting held in\r\nAuraria, that on the day a delegate to Congress was elected, delegates\r\nshould be chosen to form a Provisional Territorial Government. The\r\nproposition was adopted. Accordingly, on the first Monday in October\r\nthis double election took place.\r\n\r\nThe governor of Kansas, in 1859, had issued a proclamation that Arapahoe\r\ncounty be established, and that a representative be elected. The\r\nArapahoe county election for Kansas officials was therefore also held.\r\nCaptain Richard Sopris was elected representative, and was the first\r\nmember from Arapahoe county admitted to a seat in the Kansas\r\nlegislature. An event, worthy of relation, is the arrival of the\r\nLeavenworth and Pike’s Peak express, May 17th, 1859. This assured direct\r\ncommunication with the capital of Kansas, and thence with all the\r\nStates. It was a day of congratulations, and one to be remembered.\r\nAnother noticeable matter of record is the visit of Horace Greeley,\r\neditor of the _N. Y. Tribune_, who witnessed, with extraordinary\r\ninterest the operations of gold mining. A letter, to which he attached\r\nhis own signature, was published June 6th, 1859. This letter set forth\r\nin strong language the large returns of the mines and placer diggings.\r\nAs a consequence, another immigration that fall largely increased the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nAt the October election above mentioned, B. D. Williams was chosen\r\ndelegate to Congress. He was the exponent of the August convention, and\r\nentrusted with the mission to memorialize Congress to separate the\r\nPike’s Peak region from Kansas, and organize it into a territory under\r\nthe name of Jefferson. The other delegates chosen were instructed to\r\nform a Provisional Government. Eighty-six delegates met in convention.\r\nThey entered upon their duties with great earnestness. A new\r\nconstitution, called the “Organic Act of the Territory of Jefferson,”\r\nwas framed and adopted. Other important measures received their\r\napproval. The territory was divided into legislative districts. A full\r\nstate ticket was nominated, and an election ordered for the fourth\r\nMonday of October, the same month in which they had been elected, had\r\nconvened, had acted. The election took place; 2,000 votes were cast in\r\ntwenty-seven precincts. The Provisional Government was adopted, a full\r\ncorps of legislators chosen, and, indeed, all but one of the entire\r\nticket elected. The purpose of the parties who had determined on a\r\nProvisional Government ran swift to its fulfillment. The legislature\r\nthus suddenly and questionably brought into existence, met and began\r\ntheir session. The message of the governor, R. W. Steele, was received\r\nwith the usual formalities, and the session was passed in diligent\r\nlegislative labors. Many general and special laws were enacted; nine\r\ncounties were organized; a poll-tax of one dollar was imposed, and a\r\ncommittee appointed to report full civil and criminal codes to an\r\nadjourned session, January 23d, 1860. In each of the nine newly\r\norganized counties the governor appointed a Probate Judge, to hold\r\noffice until the regular county election on the first Monday in January,\r\n1860. The legislature met pursuant to adjournment, and for the remainder\r\nof the session devoted their attention to the report of the committee.\r\nFull civil and criminal codes were finally adopted. An _imperium in\r\nimperio_ was now fairly established. Right in the midst of the Kansas\r\nGovernment stood the Provisional Government. The first resistance to the\r\nauthority of the latter, and protest against its legality, arose from\r\nthe Arapahoe county officials, who were elected according to Kansas\r\nterritorial law, and were, therefore, beyond a doubt, legal. Besides\r\nthis, a remonstrance against the per capita tax, signed by seven hundred\r\nminers, was sent down from the mountains. In the valley, therefore, the\r\nKansas and the Provisional governments held divided sway; and in the\r\nmountains the Miners’ Courts and the Provisional Government contended\r\nfor the mastery. Golden was the only settlement that wholly submitted to\r\nthe Provisional Government. In truth, the authority of the Kansas\r\nofficials was never fairly recognized, and they soon ceased to have even\r\na nominal existence.\r\n\r\nFrom 1858 to some time in 1861, two kinds of courts existed in the\r\nPike’s Peak region, whose decisions were final. These were called the\r\nPeople’s Courts and the Miners’ Courts. The People’s Courts were\r\nimprovised assemblies of the people, who convened to adjudicate criminal\r\ncases, such as murders, homicides, and other felonies. They were usually\r\npresided over by a probate judge or justice of the peace. The extreme\r\npenalties were hanging, lashes on the bare back, and banishment. The\r\nMiners’ Courts were differently organized. Pursuant to a general call,\r\nall occupying a mining district met together. They fixed the limits of\r\ntheir district, adopted a miners’ code, defined the duties of officers,\r\nand elected them for the ensuing year. A president, judge, sheriff,\r\ncollector, surveyor, and recorder, who was _ex officio_ treasurer and\r\nsecretary of the district, composed the officers of the court, who were\r\nall responsible to the superior tribunal, the Miners’ Meeting. These\r\ncourts settled all claims and offences in mining districts. When a case\r\nwas not settled in the courts, it was carried to the Miners’ Meeting.\r\nThere was no appeal from their decision. The courts organized under the\r\nProvisional Government were respected by the people, and their decisions\r\naccepted with general satisfaction. In Denver and some other places the\r\nPeople’s Courts alone were recognized.\r\n\r\nThe year 1860 witnessed great activity in mining throughout the\r\nmountains. April 3d, 1860, Denver and Auraria, by mutual agreement of\r\nthe citizens, were consolidated. During this year the celebrated\r\nConsolidated Ditch, constructed for mining uses, was completed. In the\r\nfall of 1860 Edward M. McCook was elected representative to the Kansas\r\nlegislature. It is certain that no bills were passed for the benefit of\r\nhis constituents, who formed a very small minority of the people, and it\r\nis a matter of doubt whether he received more than his mileage. On New\r\nYear’s Day, 1860, Denver had two hundred and Auraria four hundred\r\nhouses, with a combined settled population of one thousand. At the close\r\nof 1860 it was estimated that sixty thousand people, chiefly transient,\r\nwere in the Pike’s Peak country, and the population in and around\r\nDenver, four thousand.\r\n\r\nThe Pony Express, which started simultaneously from St. Joseph,\r\nMissouri, and Sacramento, California, April 9th, 1860, and which was\r\nconceived and made a success by the bold enterprise of W. H. Russell,\r\nEsq., was an event of unusual consequence to the whole nation. Telegrams\r\nfrom New York, by this conveyance, were delivered in San Francisco in\r\neight days and four hours, and letters from San Francisco reached St.\r\nJoseph, Missouri, in eight days and nine hours. The great Pacific Mail\r\nSteamship Company had, for about ten years, held the contract for the\r\ntransportation of the U. S. mails. This service realized a million\r\ndollars annually. By this line the transit of the mails took\r\ntwenty-three days. But this achievement of the pony express, reducing\r\nthe time to eight days and nine hours, induced the government to change\r\nthe route for the Pacific mails. The contract was given to Butterfield,\r\nwho sub-contracted to W. H. Russell, through whom the Pike’s Peak gold\r\nregions soon had ample mail facilities. On May 1st, 1860, began the\r\npublication of the _Rocky Mountain Herald_, daily edition, whose racy\r\ncolumns drew an encouraging patronage. In August, 1860, the first mail\r\nservice was extended to the mountains. During this year, considering the\r\nnumber of lawless and reckless men congregated in this new country,\r\ncomparatively few crimes were committed. The criminals guilty of murder\r\nwere tried by a People’s Court, sentenced, and hanged. During the summer\r\nmonths Denver was overrun by a crew of desperadoes and robbers, who, if\r\nresisted, did not hesitate to use any violence. They assailed the office\r\nof the Denver _News_, and forcibly, with intent to kill, abducted the\r\neditor for his unsparing condemnation of their outrages. But the career\r\nof one of them was ingloriously terminated, being shot down by the\r\ncitizens, and the fate of others speedily determined by the People’s\r\nCourts. The rest hurried away to other parts, where justice did not\r\nfollow the offender so surely and so swiftly. In the mountains crimes,\r\nat first frequent, soon almost disappeared, owing to the vigilance and\r\nprompt action of the Miners’ Courts. At Washington the Congressional\r\ndelegate indefatigably pressed the petitions of the people, and urged\r\nthe necessity of immediately organising a territory. Thus 1860 passed.\r\n\r\nThe next year, so full of great events, brought the desired relief. On\r\nthe 26th of February, 1861, a bill passed Congress designating the\r\nboundaries of the new territory of Colorado, which embraced portions of\r\nKansas, Nebraska, and Utah, and providing for its political organization\r\nand administration. The news of this important event was received with\r\ngreat demonstrations of joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nORGANIC ACT.\r\n\r\nAN ACT TO PROVIDE A TEMPORARY GOVERNMENT FOR THE TERRITORY OF COLORADO.\r\n\r\n_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled_, That all that part of the\r\nterritory of the United States included within the following limits,\r\nviz: commencing on the thirty-seventh parallel of north latitude, where\r\nthe twenty-fifth meridian of longitude west from Washington crosses the\r\nsame; thence north on said meridian to the forty-first parallel of north\r\nlatitude; thence along said parallel west to the thirty-second meridian\r\nof longitude west from Washington; thence south on said meridian to the\r\nnorthern line of New Mexico; thence along the thirty-seventh parallel of\r\nnorth latitude to the place of beginning; be and the same is hereby\r\nerected into a temporary government by the name of the Territory of\r\nColorado: _Provided_, That nothing in this act contained shall be\r\nconstrued to impair the rights of person or property now pertaining to\r\nthe Indians in said Territory, so long as such rights shall remain\r\nunextinguished by treaty between the United States and such Indians, or\r\nto include any territory which, by treaty with any Indian tribe, is not,\r\nwithout the consent of said tribe, to be included within the territorial\r\nlimits or jurisdiction of any State or Territory; but all such territory\r\nshall be excepted out of the boundaries, and constitute no part of the\r\nterritory of Colorado, until said tribe shall signify their assent to\r\nthe President of the United States to be included within the said\r\nTerritory, or to affect the authority of the government of the United\r\nStates to make any regulations respecting such Indians, their lands,\r\nproperty, or other rights, by treaty, law, or otherwise, which it would\r\nhave been competent for the government to make, if this act had never\r\npassed: _Provided further_, That nothing in this act contained shall be\r\nconstrued to inhibit the government of the United States from dividing\r\nsaid Territory into two or more territories, in such manner and at such\r\ntimes as Congress shall deem convenient and proper, or from attaching\r\nany portion thereof to any other Territory or State.\r\n\r\nSEC. 2. _And be it further enacted_, That the executive power and\r\nauthority in and over said Territory of Colorado shall be vested in a\r\nGovernor, who shall hold his office four years, and until his successor\r\nshall be appointed and qualified, unless sooner removed by the President\r\nof the United States.

The Provisional government\r\ncontinued to exercise its partially acknowledged authority until the\r\narrival of the United States appointees for the new Territory. These\r\narrived on the 29th of May. The Federal officers, who then came, with\r\ntheir sealed commissions, were: William Gilpin, Governor; Lewis Ledyard\r\nWeld, Secretary; B. F. Hall, Chief Justice; S. N. Pettis, and Charles\r\nLee Armor, Associate Justices; Copeland Townsend, Marshal; James E.\r\nDalliba, Attorney General; F. M. Case, Surveyor General. The Provisional\r\ngovernment now ceased. Its laws had been published, but not enforced,\r\nand its officers had the honor, but not the pay, of the positions they\r\nheld.\r\n\r\nGovernor Gilpin was welcomed with undisguised pleasure. His greeting was\r\na perfect ovation. The people now felt a new sense of security, for the\r\nstrong arm of the General Government was in their midst. The Governor at\r\nonce proceeded with commendable energy to discharge the functions of his\r\nhigh office. His first duty was to see the settlements of the Territory,\r\nand ascertain the character, condition and wants of the people. This\r\nvisitation was accomplished with great celerity. Wherever the Governor\r\nwent, the joy and hospitality of the people knew no bounds. Everywhere\r\nhe was welcomed with bouquets, balls, congratulations. On his return to\r\nDenver, in accordance with his prescribed duty, a census was ordered.\r\nThe returns exhibited a population of 25,329. The proportion of men to\r\nwomen was nearly five to one. The Governor, qualified July 8th, and was\r\nnow in the full exercise of his authority. The other co-ordinate branch\r\nof Federal Government had now to be established. This was the United\r\nStates Supreme Court. On July 10th, the Governor assigned the judges to\r\ntheir districts, and the Supreme Court immediately organized. On July\r\n11th, he issued a proclamation, in which the Territory was declared to\r\nbe one Congressional District, and the Congressional District to be\r\ndivided into nine Council, and thirteen Representative Districts, and in\r\nwhich the election of a delegate to Congress, and of Legislative\r\nAssembly were ordered. The election was duly held on the 19th of\r\nAugust--Hiram P. Bennet was elected delegate to Congress. The\r\nLegislature of the Territory of Colorado convened on the 9th of\r\nSeptember. They adopted full civil, and criminal codes. They recognized\r\nthe miners as authority in mining legislation, acknowledged the legality\r\nof their courts, adopted their laws, confirmed their decisions, and\r\narranged for the transfer of cases to the regular courts, so that no\r\njarring, nor inconvenience was experienced. Great praise is due to this\r\nlegislative body for the laws they enacted, and though some have been\r\nfound faulty, and others repealed, yet they have effectually served the\r\nneeds of the Territory. When the rebellion had been in progress for\r\nseveral months, Gov. Gilpin issued a call for volunteers. Recruits\r\nquickly responded to the call, and the first regiment of Colorado\r\ninfantry, under Col. John P. Slough, soon took the field. This infantry\r\nwas transformed into a cavalry regiment, and did good service in\r\nrepelling the Texan invasion early in 1862. During this year immigration\r\nreceived a strong impetus. It was computed that the daily arrivals,\r\naveraging one hundred, added in a short time ten thousand to the\r\npopulation as returned by the census. The city of Denver, including\r\nAuraria and Highland, was again incorporated in November, 1861. Among\r\nthe industries, placer mining was most successfully prosecuted,\r\nCalifornia gulch alone yielding one million dollars.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1862, Dr. John Evans superseded Governor William Gilpin. The\r\nlevy of the second regiment of Colorado cavalry was made this year, and\r\nthe troops ordered to Missouri. In 1863 they were consolidated with the\r\nthird regiment raised in Colorado. This body of cavalry did effective\r\nservice in Missouri, and in 1864 won considerable renown in the\r\nmovements executed against Price in his last invasion. They took a\r\nprominent part in four battles, to wit: Mine Creek, Oct. 22; Westport,\r\nOct. 23; Charlot, Oct. 25; Newtonia, Nov. 4. The quantity of gold\r\nobtained by gulch mining this year exceeded any previous yield. H. P.\r\nBennet was re-elected delegate to Congress in September.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1863 began in the East the stupendous speculation in gold\r\nmines. The spirit of speculation had infected all classes of people, and\r\nfinancial schemes were quickly devised to draw millions from the public.\r\nAmong these Colorado mines prominently figured. On the 19th of April\r\nDenver lost, by a severe conflagration, a sum estimated at a quarter of\r\na million dollars. A branch telegraph line was completed from Julesburg\r\nto Denver in October, whereby telegraphic communication with the world\r\nwas established. On the 7th of October a treaty was concluded with the\r\nTabeguache band of Utah Indians, by which the Indian title to all of the\r\nsettled portions of the mountains of Colorado, and most of the San Luis\r\nvalley, was extinguished.\r\n\r\nThe year 1864 was the gloomy period of the rebellion. Speculation\r\nbecame a mania. Stock companies of the most gigantic character were\r\norganized on the basis of Colorado gold mines. It need hardly be said\r\nthat thousands lost large sums by reckless investments in gold mining\r\nstocks. In the spring the Indians of the plains, composed of Sioux,\r\nCheyennes, and Arapahoes, combined to carry on a bloody and\r\nexterminating war against the whites. They attacked the coaches;\r\nmurdered, scalped, and mutilated the passengers. Exposed dwellings were\r\nsurrounded and the inmates massacred. Emboldened by little or no\r\nresistance, they admitted no pause to their savage butcheries. This\r\nthoroughly roused the people to punish the hostile fiends. Twelve\r\nhundred men, under the command of Col. J. M. Chivington, hurried forward\r\nto meet the merciless savages, and arrest their work of horrors. They\r\nfound and suddenly assailed a large troop of Cheyennes, about seven\r\nhundred in number, and with hearts steeled against mercy, dealt swift\r\nretribution, sparing neither age nor sex, until nearly all were\r\ndestroyed. This stunning blow checked the Indian outrages. A temporary\r\nquiet ensued, and the roads were again animated with coaches and wagon\r\ntrains. Much credit is due to Captain Tyler, who, with his brave\r\ncompany, opened and protected the line of communication with the States.\r\nOn May 19th, a more disastrous calamity befell Denver than the fire of\r\nthe preceding year. An appalling flood swept down Cherry Creek,\r\noverwhelming large buildings, and sweeping them and their contents down\r\nits destructive current. Twenty persons perished in the ruthless waters.\r\nThe damages were computed to be a million dollars. Near the close of the\r\nThirty-eighth Congress, a bill was passed, in response to a petition of\r\nthe Colorado Legislature, enabling the territory to organize a State\r\ngovernment and enter the Union. Under its provisions a convention met in\r\nDenver July 4th, 1864, and framed a constitution. This was rejected by\r\nthe people on the second Tuesday of October. In the fall of 1864, A. A.\r\nBradford was elected delegate to Congress.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 the Indians renewed hostilities, apparently determined to force\r\nback immigration. All intercourse with the East was interrupted for a\r\ntime. Business was paralyzed. Lonely ranches were invaded, and their\r\noccupants fiendishly massacred. This second outbreak of the Indians was\r\neffectually checked by United States troops. In the spring of this year\r\nall parties concurred in another attempt to organize a state. A\r\nconvention met in Denver in August, and framed a constitution, which was\r\nadopted by a majority of 155. A State legislature, and the complement of\r\nState officers, were elected November 14th. Ex-Governor William Gilpin\r\nwas chosen State Governor. Ex-Governor John Evans and Jerome B. Chaffee\r\nwere chosen senators by the legislature. Application for the admission\r\nof Colorado as a state was made during each session of the Thirty-ninth\r\nCongress. A strong disinclination to grant the application was\r\nmanifested. An exigency, however, arose, which changed their\r\ndisposition. The President, Andrew Johnson, had been impeached. The\r\nsuccess of the impeachment was involved in doubt. To secure two senators\r\nand a representative, an enabling act was passed to admit the new state.\r\nThe President, as might be expected, vetoed the bill. Governor John\r\nEvans was superseded by Alexander Cummings, who qualified October 19th.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 a reaction followed the prostration of trade and industry\r\nconsequent upon the Indian outrages of the preceding year. An unwonted\r\nstimulus pervaded the territory. Mining pursuits were followed with\r\nfresh vigor. In Denver and other places building was carried on with\r\nunparalleled activity. Money became plentiful, and many laid the\r\nfoundations of large fortunes. George M. Chilcott was elected delegate.\r\nUp to this time the bullion deposited in the mint amounted to 12,401,372\r\ndollars, said to be less than half of the real yield.\r\n\r\nOn May 27th, 1867, A. C. Hunt superseded Governor Cummings. The struggle\r\nfor statehood ended with the winter of 1867-8, when it was found\r\nimpossible to pass the bill over the veto. In the fall the Denver Board\r\nof Trade was organized, which principally labored to initiate the\r\nenterprise of building a railroad to join the Union Pacific road at\r\nCheyenne. Near the close of the year the Union Pacific road reached\r\nCheyenne. The Denver Pacific Railway and Telegraph Company was\r\nincorporated November 18th, 1867. During this year the various interests\r\nof Colorado were ably represented at the Universal Exposition in Paris.\r\nThe first gold medal was awarded to the minerals of Colorado. The French\r\nGovernment, moved by Colorado’s display at the Exposition, appointed an\r\nImperial Commissioner, who visited the territory and reported his\r\nobservations therein for the benefit of capital and science in France.\r\nThe Kiowas and Comanches, the Cheyennes and Arapahoes were removed to\r\nreservations bordering on Colorado and Kansas, where their southern\r\nboundary lines meet. By their treaties they stipulate to withdraw\r\nopposition to immigrants, settlers, and lines of railroad.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 A. A. Bradford was again elected delegate to Congress.\r\n\r\nOn June 15th, 1869, Edward M. McCook superseded Governor A. C. Hunt.\r\n\r\nThe Denver Pacific Railway Company had been formed in 1867. Its\r\nprincipal object, as stated in the articles of incorporation, was to\r\nbuild a railroad and telegraph line to Cheyenne, and there connect with\r\nthe Union Pacific road. After some delay the funds were secured, the\r\nconstruction of the road hastened, and on the 23d day of June, 1870, the\r\nfirst train arrived in Denver. On the 15th day of August, the Kansas\r\nPacific Railway, 640 miles in length, was completed. In September,\r\nseventeen miles of the Colorado Central were finished. The connection of\r\nGolden with Denver was thereby effected. During this year successful\r\nefforts were made to plant colonies in choice sections of the Territory.\r\nThe Meeker-Greeley colony was organized in New York in the winter of\r\n1869-70, and located in the spring. It now has a population of 2,000,\r\nhappy and prosperous, and distinguished by prohibition laws and devotion\r\nto temperance. The town site of the colony is a delta formed by the\r\nCache-a-la-Poudre and South Platte rivers. The Chicago-Colorado colony\r\nis largely composed of Western men, and is animated by a liberal\r\nprogressive spirit. The location of the colony is in every way most\r\ndesirable. The energy and enterprise of the colonists excite great\r\nadmiration. They have already a beautiful town, and a large extent of\r\ncountry under cultivation. The German colony may also be mentioned. It\r\noccupied Wet Mountain Valley, which lies in Pueblo and Fremont counties.\r\nThus, by rapid transit, the Territory was brought into close\r\ncommunication with the States, and began to fill up with thousands, who,\r\nindependently, or in co-operative association, settled for the purposes\r\nof agriculture. No sign so cheering as a settlement of a country by\r\nintelligent, enterprising farmers. Hardy, industrious miners had already\r\ncrowded into the mountains, and skillful, energetic farmers now\r\ncollected on the plains, intent to reap from them rich and abundant\r\nharvests. In the fall, Jerome B. Chaffee was elected delegate to\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThis year, 1871, dates the settlement of the Colorado Springs colony,\r\ndistinguished for its rapid and prosperous growth. Situated seventy-five\r\nmiles south from Denver, it became the temporary terminus of the Denver\r\nand Rio Grande railway, which was completed to that point during this\r\nyear. The railroad has since passed on to Pueblo, and thence to La Veta,\r\nwith branches to El Moro, and Canon City.\r\n\r\nIn 1872, Jerome B. Chaffee was re-elected delegate to Congress.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, a large immigration into the San Juan region commenced, owing\r\nto reports of rich mineral discoveries. S. H. Elbert superseded Gov. E.\r\nM. McCook. Following the custom of those removed from office, the\r\nex-Governor proceeded to Washington to confer with the federal\r\nauthorities, and in January, 1874, was re-appointed in place of Gov.\r\nElbert. Severe and bitter editorials filled the columns of the press\r\ndevoted to the fallen regime. A temporary division of the Republican\r\nparty ensued. A lively contest for political supremacy followed and\r\ncontinued until the usual period for an election to Congress, when the\r\ntwo sides of the party marshaled themselves, the one to rebuke and the\r\nother to sustain the administration. The malcontents not only turned the\r\nelection against the Republican nominee, H. P. H. Bromwell, but gave a\r\nlarge and unprecedented majority to the Democratic nominee, Thomas M.\r\nPatterson. This change in the popular vote deeply touched the\r\nadministration, and it was determined, in order to reconcile the\r\ndisaffected, to remove the obnoxious appointments, and fill the federal\r\noffices with men not implicated in the controversy.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1874, the South Park railroad was finished to Morrison.\r\n\r\nJohn L. Routt, the successor to Gov. McCook, qualified on March 29th,\r\n1875. He set to work without delay to unite the discordant factions and\r\nsucceeded. The people in general were now fully persuaded that the time\r\nhad come for demanding the privileges of Statehood. The Republican\r\ndelegate, Jerome B. Chaffee, had during the winter of 1874-5, drawn up\r\nan Enabling Act with much skill, and by persistent effort and untiring\r\nzeal, had, in the face of strong opposition, effected the passage of the\r\nbill. Before its passage the Act was amended so as to postpone the date\r\nof admission to July 4th, 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    An Act to amend the Act entitled “An Act to enable the people of\r\n    Colorado to form a constitution and State government, and for\r\n    the admission of said State into the Union on an equal footing\r\n    with the original States,” approved March 3, 1875.\r\n\r\n\r\nENABLING ACT.\r\n\r\n_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled_, That the inhabitants of the\r\nTerritory of Colorado included in the boundaries hereinafter designated\r\nbe, and they are hereby, authorized to form for themselves, out of said\r\nTerritory, a State government, with the name of the State of Colorado;\r\nwhich State, when formed, shall be admitted into the Union upon an equal\r\nfooting with the original States in all respects whatsoever, as\r\nhereinafter provided.\r\n\r\nSEC. 2.

D. 1875, on behalf and by the authority of the people of the\r\nTerritory of Colorado, this Convention assembled in pursuance of said\r\nEnabling Act, at the city of Denver, the capital of said Territory, on\r\nthe twentieth day of December, A. D. 1875, does ordain and declare:\r\n\r\n_First_--That an election shall be held throughout the Territory of\r\nColorado, on the first day of July, in the year one thousand eight\r\nhundred and seventy-six, for ratification or rejection of the\r\nConstitution framed and adopted by the Convention.\r\n\r\n_Second_--At said election the Constitution framed and adopted by this\r\nConvention, shall be submitted to the people of the Territory for their\r\nratification or rejection, and all persons who are then qualified\r\nelectors under the laws of the Territory, shall be qualified to vote\r\nupon the ratification or rejection thereof.\r\n\r\n_Third_--Said election shall be held at the several places in the\r\nseveral wards and precincts throughout the Territory, appointed for the\r\nholding of elections under the laws of the Territory, and shall be\r\nconducted in the manner prescribed by the laws of said Territory\r\nregulating elections. The judges of elections, appointed under the laws\r\nof the Territory, in each of said wards and precincts, shall act as the\r\njudges of said election, and vacancies in the board of judges of any\r\nward or precinct shall be filled, and clerks of election shall be\r\nappointed, in the manner prescribed by said laws: _Provided_, That no\r\nlaw requiring a registration of voters shall apply to said election, and\r\nany qualified elector may at said election vote at any ward or precinct\r\nin the Territory. Whenever any person shall present himself to vote at\r\nsaid election, and either of the judges shall suspect that such person\r\nis not a qualified elector of the Territory, or if his vote shall be\r\nchallenged by any elector who has previously voted at the said election,\r\nthen before the ballot of such person shall be received, he shall take\r\nand subscribe the following oath or affirmation: “You do solemnly swear\r\n(or affirm) that you are a resident of ---- county, in the Territory of\r\nColorado; that you have resided in this Territory six months immediately\r\npreceding this election; that you have, to the best of your knowledge\r\nand belief, attained the age of twenty-one years, and have not voted at\r\nthis election.”\r\n\r\n_Fourth_--Each elector voting at said election shall deposit in the\r\nballot-box a ticket, whereon shall be printed or written the words “For\r\nthe Constitution,” or the words, “Against the Constitution,” or other\r\nequivalent words.\r\n\r\n_Fifth_--The acting Governor of the Territory shall, within thirty days\r\nafter the adjournment of this Convention, issue his proclamation for\r\nsaid election, to be held in conformity with the provisions of this\r\nordinance; and the Secretary of the Territory shall, on or before the\r\nfifteenth day of May, A. D. 1876, make out and transmit to the sheriff\r\nof each county a notice in writing of said election, together with a\r\ncopy of this ordinance.\r\n\r\n_Sixth_--The votes cast at said election for the adoption or rejection\r\nof the Constitution, shall be canvassed in the manner prescribed by the\r\nlaws of the Territory of Colorado for canvassing the votes at general\r\nelections; and the returns of said election shall be made to the acting\r\nGovernor of the Territory, who, with the Chief Justice and the United\r\nStates Attorney of said Territory, or any two of them, shall canvass the\r\nsame, and if a majority of the legal votes cast shall be for the\r\nConstitution, the acting Governor shall certify the same to the\r\nPresident of the United States, together with a copy of said\r\nConstitution and the Ordinances adopted by this Convention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the requirements of an Act of the Congress of the\r\nUnited States, entitled “An Act to enable the People of Colorado to form\r\na Constitution and State Government, and for the admission of said\r\nState into the Union on an equal footing with the original States,”\r\napproved March 3d, A. D. 1875, on behalf and by the authority of the\r\nPeople of the Territory of Colorado, this Convention, assembled in\r\npursuance of said Enabling Act, at the city of Denver, the capital of\r\nsaid Territory, on the 20th day of December, A. D. 1875, does ordain and\r\ndeclare:\r\n\r\n_First_--That perfect toleration of religious sentiment shall be\r\nsecured, and no inhabitant of said State shall ever be molested in\r\nperson or property on account of his or her mode of religious worship.\r\n\r\n_Second_--That the people inhabiting the Territory of Colorado, by their\r\nrepresentatives in said Convention assembled, do agree and declare that\r\nthey forever disclaim all right and title to the unappropriated public\r\nlands lying within said Territory, and that the same shall be and remain\r\nat the sole and entire disposal of the United States; that the lands\r\nbelonging to citizens of the United States residing without said State,\r\nshall never be taxed higher than the lands belonging to residents\r\nthereof; and that no taxes shall be imposed by the State on lands or\r\nproperty therein belonging to, or which may hereafter be purchased by,\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n_Third_--That this Ordinance shall be irrevocable without the consent of\r\nthe United States and the people of the State of Colorado.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBE IT REMEMBERED, That in the Convention of the Representatives of the\r\nPeople of the Territory of Colorado, chosen in pursuance of the Act of\r\nCongress of the United States, entitled “An Act to enable the People of\r\nColorado to form a Constitution and State Government, and for the\r\nadmission of the said State into the Union on an equal footing with the\r\noriginal States,” approved March 3d, A. D. 1875, and assembled at the\r\nseat of government of said Territory, in pursuance of said Act, on the\r\ntwentieth day of December, A. D. 1875, after the organization of said\r\nConvention, and before proceeding to other business, it was, on the 22d\r\nday of December, A. D. 1875.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_--That in pursuance of the Enabling Act, and in behalf of the\r\nPeople of Colorado, we in convention assembled, do adopt the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe constitution was submitted to the people and adopted July 1st, 1876,\r\nby a large majority. The votes returned stood 15,443 for, and 4,039\r\nagainst the constitution. This constitution is an admirable production,\r\nand reflects great credit on those who framed it. Though not perfect, it\r\ncontains the excellencies of all the State constitutions so far\r\npromulgated, and largely conforms in spirit to the liberality and\r\nintelligence of the people for whom it was prepared. President Grant,\r\nempowered by Congress, on July 4th, 1876, just one century since the\r\ndeclaration of independence, admitted the new State into the Union by\r\nproclamation. Hence Colorado’s title--“The Centennial State.” (The honor\r\nof first applying this title to Colorado is due to Capt. R. W. Woodbury,\r\neditor and proprietor of the _Denver Times_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROCLAMATION OF THE PRESIDENT ADMITTING THE STATE OF COLORADO INTO\r\nTHE UNION.\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, The Congress of the United States did, by an act approved on\r\nthe third day of March, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five,\r\nauthorize the inhabitants of the Territory of Colorado to form for\r\nthemselves, out of said Territory, a State Government, with the name of\r\nthe State of Colorado, and for the admission of such State into the\r\nUnion on an equal footing with the original states upon certain\r\nconditions in said act specified; and,\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, It was provided by said Act of Congress that the Convention\r\nelected by the people of said Territory to frame a State Constitution,\r\nshould, when assembled for that purpose, and after organization, declare\r\non behalf of the people that they adopt the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, and should also provide by an ordinance, irrevocable without the\r\nconsent of the United States and the people of said State, that perfect\r\ntoleration of religious sentiment shall be secured, and that no\r\ninhabitant of said State shall ever be molested in person or property on\r\naccount of his or her mode of religious worship, and that the people\r\ninhabiting said Territory do agree and declare that they forever\r\ndisclaim all right and title to the unappropriated public lands lying\r\nwithin said Territory, and that the same shall be and remain at the sole\r\nand entire disposition of the United States, and that lands belonging to\r\ncitizens of the United States residing without the said State, shall\r\nnever be taxed higher than lands belonging to residents thereof, and\r\nthat no taxes shall be imposed by the State on lands or property therein\r\nbelonging to, or which may hereafter be purchased by, the United States;\r\nand,\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, It was further provided by said Act that the Constitution thus\r\nformed for the people of the Territory of Colorado should, by an\r\nordinance of the Convention forming the same, be submitted to the people\r\nof said Territory for ratification or rejection at an election to be\r\nheld in the month of July, eighteen hundred and seventy-six, at which\r\nelection the lawful voters of said new State should vote directly for or\r\nagainst the proposed Constitution, and the returns of said election\r\nshould be made to the acting Governor of the Territory, who, with the\r\nChief Justice and United States attorney of said Territory, or any two\r\nof them, should canvass the same, and if a majority of legal votes\r\nshould be cast for said Constitution in said proposed State, the said\r\nacting Governor should certify the same to the President of the United\r\nStates, together with a copy of said Constitution and Ordinances;\r\nwhereupon it should be the duty of the President of the United States to\r\nissue his proclamation declaring the State admitted into the Union on an\r\nequal footing with the original states without any further action\r\nwhatever on the part of Congress; and\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, It has been certified to me by the acting Governor of said\r\nTerritory of Colorado, that within the time prescribed by said Act of\r\nCongress a Constitution for said proposed State has been adopted, and\r\nthe same ratified by a majority of the legal voters of said proposed new\r\nState, in accordance with the conditions prescribed by said Act of\r\nCongress; and\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, A duly authenticated copy of said Constitution, and of the\r\ndeclaration and ordinances required by said Act of Congress has been\r\nreceived by me:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Ulysses S. Grant, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, do, in accordance with the provisions of the Act of Congress\r\naforesaid, declare and proclaim the fact that the fundamental conditions\r\nimposed by Congress on the State of Colorado, to entitle that State to\r\nadmission to the Union have been ratified and accepted, and that the\r\nadmission of said State into the Union is now complete.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and have caused the\r\nseal of the United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington this first day of August, in the year of\r\nour Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States of America the one hundred and first.\r\n\r\n  U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n  By the President:\r\n  HAMILTON FISH,\r\n  Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of this year the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroad\r\nwas completed to Pueblo.\r\n\r\nThe Republican State Convention met at Pueblo August 23d, and the\r\nDemocratic State Convention at Manitou, August 29th. Full state tickets\r\nwere nominated by each convention. Both parties entered upon the\r\ncampaign not only sanguine, but confident of success. Up to the day of\r\nelection the most strenuous efforts were put forth to insure victory.\r\nOn the third day of October, as directed by the Constitution, the\r\nelection was held. The vote polled was nearly 30,000. The entire\r\nRepublican state ticket for the executive and judicial departments was\r\nelected. John L. Routt was chosen Governor; Lafayette Head,\r\nLieutenant-Governor; William M. Clark, Secretary of State; D. C.\r\nCrawford, Auditor; George C. Corning, Treasurer; A. J. Sampson, Attorney\r\nGeneral; Joseph C. Shattuck, Superintendent Public Instruction. The\r\nLegislature, in both House and Senate, had a Republican majority. In the\r\nSenate, nineteen Republicans and seven Democrats; in the House,\r\nthirty-one Republicans and eighteen Democrats. James B. Belford was\r\nelected Representative for the Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth Congresses.\r\nThe Territorial Secretary had ordered an election for representative for\r\nthe Forty-fourth Congress to be held October 3d, and afterwards an\r\nelection for the Forty-fifth Congress to be held November 7th. On the\r\nthird of October the people voted for a representative for both\r\nCongresses. The State Canvassing Board received and counted the returns.\r\nThe Secretary recalled his order for an election November 7th, but an\r\nelection was held, and Thomas M. Patterson received almost the entire\r\nvote. This vote the Canvassing Board refused to count. The next Congress\r\nwill decide the contest.\r\n\r\nAt noon on November 1st the General Assembly convened. On November 3d\r\nthe executive officers were duly inaugurated. Judge Brazee administered\r\nthe oaths of office. The Governor then delivered his inaugural message\r\nto the General Assembly. This message of the first governor of the State\r\nof Colorado is a sensible and well-written document. Its statements are\r\naccurate and clear, and its suggestions thoroughly practical. He thus\r\naddresses the General Assembly: “The people, by their choice, have\r\nsignified their faith in your wisdom, integrity, and patriotism, and I\r\nfeel assured that their confidence will not have been misplaced. Upon\r\nyou, Senators and Representatives, rests the responsibility of making\r\nour laws, and I trust that in your legislation you will have a single\r\neye to the promotion of the general welfare. In this object it will be\r\nmy greatest pleasure and chief aim to co-operate.” In this message it is\r\nstated that the present export of gold and silver bullion and ores\r\namounts to nearly $8,000,000 annually, with a prospect of an increase to\r\n$10,000,000 in the near future. The total value of real and personal\r\nproperty in Colorado, in 1876, is estimated to be about $100,000,000. Up\r\nto 1877 the bullion deposited in the Denver mint amounted to almost\r\n$70,000,000 in value. The population of Colorado in 1870 was about\r\n40,000, in 1876, 135,000. In the early part of the session the General\r\nAssembly chose two Senators--Jerome B. Chaffee and Henry M. Teller; and\r\nthree Presidential Electors--Herman Beckurts, W. L. Hadley, and Otto\r\nMears. After a protracted session, the General Assembly adjourned _sine\r\ndie_, March 20, 1877.\r\n\r\nColorado, on account of its altitude, is quite near that great ocean of\r\npositive electricity which envelops the earth about a mile from its\r\nsurface. It is one of the great electrodes of the globe. All that ascend\r\nher high peaks are charged with this subtle element. To this, in a\r\nmeasure, is to be attributed that peculiar bracing and life-inspiring\r\natmosphere for which Colorado is renowned. This atmosphere is dry, pure\r\nand clear, and nearly always pervaded with sunshine. The climate\r\ntherefore possesses great restorative properties, and cannot fail to be\r\na prominent resort for invalids. But besides this, in magnificent and\r\nvaried scenery Colorado is not excelled by any other land, and in rich\r\nresources is unequalled. In Colorado large sums have been expended in\r\nimposing school structures, and teachers are liberally remunerated. A\r\nspirit of religious toleration that is truly gratifying prevails\r\nthroughout the State. All creeds are represented, and, in general, well\r\nsupported. Towns spring into existence and grow with magic speed; mines\r\nare developed with much energy; farms show thrift and prosperity; new\r\nrailroads are projected; the lines of those already built are extending;\r\nmanufactures increase, though slow in their establishment; and,\r\nnotwithstanding an occasional exodus, the population steadily advances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect\r\nunion, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the\r\ncommon defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of\r\nliberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this\r\nConstitution of the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE I.\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\n1.

Immediately after they shall be assembled, in consequence of the\r\nfirst election, they shall be divided, as equally as may be, into three\r\nclasses. The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated\r\nat the expiration of the second year; of the second class, at the\r\nexpiration of the fourth year; and of the third class, at the expiration\r\nof the sixth year; so that one-third may be chosen every second year;\r\nand if vacancies happen, by resignation or otherwise, during the recess\r\nof the legislature of any State, the executive thereof may make\r\ntemporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature, which\r\nshall then fill such vacancies.\r\n\r\n3. No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained the age of\r\nthirty years, and been nine years a citizen of the United States, and\r\nwho shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State for which he\r\nshall be chosen.\r\n\r\n4.

The times, places, and manner of holding elections for Senators and\r\nRepresentatives shall be prescribed in each State, by the legislature\r\nthereof, but the Congress may at any time, by law, make or alter such\r\nregulations, except as to the places of choosing Senators.\r\n\r\n2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such\r\nmeeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by\r\nlaw appoint a different day.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.\r\n\r\n1. Each House shall be the judge of the elections, returns, and\r\nqualifications of its own members, and a majority of each shall\r\nconstitute a quorum to do business; but a smaller number may adjourn\r\nfrom day to day, and may be authorized to compel the attendance of\r\nabsent members, in such manner and under such penalties as each House\r\nmay provide.\r\n\r\n2.

And if the House of\r\nRepresentatives shall not choose a President whenever the right of\r\nchoice shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of March next\r\nfollowing, then the Vice-President shall act as President, as in the\r\ncase of the death or other Constitutional disability of the President.\r\n\r\n2. The person having the greatest number of votes as Vice-President,\r\nshall be the Vice-President, if such number be a majority of the whole\r\nnumber of electors appointed; and if no person have a majority, then\r\nfrom the two highest numbers on the list, the Senate shall choose the\r\nVice-President; a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of\r\nthe whole number of Senators, and a majority of the whole number shall\r\nbe necessary to a choice.\r\n\r\n3. But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President,\r\nshall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XIII.\r\n\r\n1. Neither slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for\r\ncrime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist\r\nwithin the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XIV.\r\n\r\n1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to\r\nthe jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the\r\nState wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which\r\nshall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United\r\nStates; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or\r\nproperty, without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its\r\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\r\n\r\n2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States\r\naccording to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of\r\npersons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right\r\nto vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and\r\nVice-President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the\r\nexecutive and judicial officers of a State, or the members of the\r\nLegislature thereof is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such\r\nState, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States,\r\nor in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion or other\r\ncrime, the basis of Representatives therein shall be reduced in the\r\nproportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the\r\nwhole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\r\n\r\n3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or\r\nelector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or\r\nmilitary, under the United States, or under any State, who, having\r\npreviously taken an oath as a member of Congress, or as an officer of\r\nthe United States, or as a member of any State Legislature, or as an\r\nexecutive or judicial officer of any State, to support the constitution\r\nof the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion\r\nagainst the same, or given aid and comfort to the enemies thereof. But\r\nCongress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such\r\ndisability.\r\n\r\n4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by\r\nlaw, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for\r\nservices in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be\r\nquestioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or\r\npay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion\r\nagainst the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of\r\nany slave, but all such debts, obligations, and claims shall be held\r\nillegal and void.\r\n\r\n5. That Congress have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the\r\nprovisions of this article.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XV.\r\n\r\n1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be\r\ndenied or abridged by the United States, or by any State, on account of\r\nrace, color, or previous condition of servitude.\r\n\r\n2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUAL OF PARLIAMENTARY PRACTICE.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--The rules and practices peculiar to the Senate are\r\n    printed between brackets [ ]. Those of PARLIAMENT are not so\r\n    distinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF RULES.\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF ADHERING TO RULES.\r\n\r\nMr. Onslow, the ablest among the Speakers of the House of Commons, used\r\nto say, “It was a maxim he had often heard when he was a young man, from\r\nold and experienced Members, that nothing tended more to throw power\r\ninto the hands of the administration, and those who acted with the\r\nmajority of the House of Commons, than a neglect of, or departure from,\r\nthe rules of proceeding: that these forms, as instituted by our\r\nancestors, operated as a check and control on the actions of the\r\nmajority, and that they were, in many instances, a shelter and\r\nprotection to the minority, against the attempts of power.” So far the\r\nmaxim is certainly true, and it is founded in good sense, that as it is\r\nalways in the power of the majority, by their numbers, to stop any\r\nimproper measures proposed on the part of their opponents, the only\r\nweapons by which the minority can defend themselves against similar\r\nattempts from those in power, are the forms and rules of proceeding\r\nwhich have been adopted as they were found necessary, from time to time,\r\nand are become the law of the House; by a strict adherence to which, the\r\nweaker party can only be protected from those irregularities and abuses\r\nwhich these forms were intended to check, and which the wantonness of\r\npower is but too often apt to suggest to large and successful\r\nmajorities. 2 _Hats._, 171, 172.\r\n\r\nAnd whether these forms be in all cases the most rational or not, is\r\nreally not of so great importance. It is much more material that there\r\nshould be a rule to go by, than what that rule is; that there may be a\r\nuniformity of proceeding in business, not subject to the caprice of the\r\nSpeaker, or captiousness of the members. It is very material that order,\r\ndecency, and regularity, be preserved in a dignified public body. _2\r\nHats._, 149.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE.\r\n\r\n[All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of\r\nthe United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives. _Constitution of the United States, Art. 1, Sec. 1._]\r\n\r\n[The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their\r\nservices, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the Treasury of the\r\nUnited States. _Constitution of the United States, Art. 1, Sec. 6._]\r\n\r\n[For the powers of Congress, see the following Articles and Sections of\r\nthe Constitution of the United States: I., 4, 7, 8, 9; II., 1, 2; III.,\r\n3; IV., 1, 3, 5, and all the amendments.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGE.\r\n\r\nThe privileges of Members of Parliament, from small and obscure\r\nbeginnings, have been advancing for centuries with a firm and never\r\nyielding pace. Claims seem to have been brought forward from time to\r\ntime, and repeated, till some example of their admission enabled them to\r\nbuild law on that example. We can only, therefore, state the points of\r\nprogression at which they now are. It is now acknowledged: 1st. That\r\nthey are at all times exempted from question elsewhere for anything said\r\nin their own House; that during the time of privilege, 2d. Neither a\r\nMember himself, his[1] wife, nor his servants, (familaries sui,) for any\r\nmatter of their own, may be[2] arrested on mesne process, in any civil\r\nsuit: 3d. Nor be detained under execution, though levied before time of\r\nprivilege: 4th. Nor impleaded, cited, or subpœnaed in any court: 5th.\r\nNor summoned as a witness or juror: 6th. Nor may their lands or goods be\r\ndistrained: 7th. Nor their persons assaulted, or characters traduced.\r\nAnd the period of time covered by privilege, before and after the\r\nsession, with the practice of short prorogations under the connivance of\r\nthe Crown, amounts in fact to a perpetual protection against the course\r\nof justice. In one instance, indeed, it has been relaxed by the 10 G. 3,\r\nc. 50, which permits judiciary proceedings to go on against them. That\r\nthese privileges must be continually progressive, seems to result from\r\ntheir rejecting all definition of them; the doctrine being that “their\r\ndignity and independence are preserved by keeping their privileges\r\nindefinite; and that ‘the maxims upon which they proceed, together with\r\nthe method of proceeding, rest entirely in their own breast, and are not\r\ndefined and ascertained by any particular stated laws.’” 1 _Blackst._,\r\n163, 164.\r\n\r\n[It was probably from this view of the encroaching character of\r\nprivilege that the framers of our Constitution, in their care to provide\r\nthat the law shall bind equally on all, and especially that those who\r\nmake them shall not exempt themselves from their operation, have only\r\nprivileged “Senators and Representatives” themselves from the single act\r\nof “arrest in all cases except treason, felony and breach of the peace,\r\nduring their attendance at the session of their respective Houses, and\r\nin going to and returning from the same, and from being questioned in\r\nany other place for any speech or debate in either House.” _Const. U.\r\nS., Art. 1, Sec. 6._ Under the general authority “to make all laws\r\nnecessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers given them,”\r\n_Const. U. S., Art. 2, Sec. 8_, they may provide by law the details\r\nwhich may be necessary for giving full effect to the enjoyment of this\r\nprivilege. No such law being as yet made, it seems to stand at present\r\non the following ground: 1. The act of arrest is void, ab initio.[3] 2.\r\nThe member arrested may be discharged on motion, 1 _Bl._ 166; 3 _Stra._,\r\n990; or by habeas corpus under the Federal or State authority, as the\r\ncase may be; or by a writ of privilege out of the Chancery, 2 _Stra._,\r\n989, in those States which have adopted that part of the laws of\r\nEngland. _Orders of the House of Commons, 1550, February 20._ 3. The\r\narrest being unlawful, is a trespass for which the officers and others\r\nconcerned are liable to action and indictment in the ordinary courts of\r\njustice, as in other cases of unauthorized arrest. 4. The court before\r\nwhich the process is returnable is bound to act as in other cases of\r\nunauthorized proceeding, and liable also, as in other similar cases, to\r\nhave their proceedings stayed or corrected by the superior courts.]\r\n\r\n[The time necessary for going to, and returning from, Congress, not\r\nbeing defined, it will, of course, be judged of in every particular case\r\nby those who will have to decide the case.] While privilege was\r\nunderstood in England to extend, as it does here, only to exemption from\r\narrest, eundo, moranda, et redeundo, the House of Commons themselves\r\ndecided that “a convenient time was to be understood.” (1580) 1 _Hats._,\r\n99, 100. Nor is the law so strict in point of time as to require the\r\nparty to set out immediately on his return, but allows him time to\r\nsettle his private affairs, and to prepare for his journey; and does not\r\neven scan his road very nicely, nor forfeit his protection for a little\r\ndeviation from that which is most direct; some necessity perhaps\r\nconstraining him to it. 2 _Stra._, 986, 987.\r\n\r\nThis privilege from arrest, privileges of course against all process,\r\nthe disobedience to which is punishable by an attachment of the person;\r\nas a subpœna ad respondendum, or, testificandum, or a summons on a jury;\r\nand with reason, because a member has superior duty to perform in\r\nanother place. [When a representative is withdrawn from his seat by\r\nsummons, the 40,000 people whom he represents lose their voice in debate\r\nand vote, as they do on his voluntary absence; when a senator is\r\nwithdrawn by summons, his State loses half its voice in debate and vote,\r\nas it does on his voluntary absence. The enormous disparity of evil\r\nadmits no comparison.]\r\n\r\n[So far there will probably be no difference of opinion as to the\r\nprivileges of the two Houses of Congress; but in the following cases it\r\nis otherwise. In December, 1795, the House of Representatives committed\r\ntwo persons of the name of Randall and Whitney, for attempting to\r\ncorrupt the integrity of certain members, which they considered as a\r\ncontempt and breach of the privileges of the House; and the facts being\r\nproved, Whitney was detained in confinement a fortnight, and Randall\r\nthree weeks, and was reprimanded by the Speaker. In March, 1796, the\r\nHouse of Representatives voted a challenge given to a member of their\r\nHouse to be a breach of the privileges of the House; but satisfactory\r\napologies and acknowledgments being made, no further proceeding was had.\r\nThe editor of the _Aurora_ having, in his paper of February 19, 1800,\r\ninserted some paragraphs defamatory of the Senate, and failed in his\r\nappearance, he was ordered to be committed. In debating the legality of\r\nthis order, it was insisted, in support of it, that every man, by the\r\nlaw of nature, and every body of men, possesses the right of\r\nself-defence; that all public functionaries are essentially invested\r\nwith the powers of self-preservation; that they have an inherent right\r\nto do all acts necessary to keep themselves in a condition to discharge\r\nthe trusts confided to them; that whenever authorities are given, the\r\nmeans of carrying them into execution are given by necessary\r\nimplication; that thus we see the British Parliament exercise the right\r\nof punishing contempts; all the State Legislatures exercise the same\r\npower, and every court does the same; that, if we have it not, we sit at\r\nthe mercy of every intruder who may enter our doors or gallery, and, by\r\nnoise and tumult, render proceeding in business impracticable; that if\r\nour tranquility is to be perpetually disturbed by newspaper defamation,\r\nit will not be possible to exercise our functions with the requisite\r\ncoolness and deliberation; and that we must, therefore, have a power to\r\npunish these disturbers of our peace and proceedings. To this it was\r\nanswered, that the Parliament and courts of England have cognizance of\r\ncontempts by the express provisions of their law; that the State\r\nLegislatures have equal authority, because their powers are plenary;\r\nthey represent their constituents completely, and possess all their\r\npowers, except such as their Constitutions have expressly denied them;\r\nthat the courts of the several States have the same powers by the laws\r\nof their States, and those of the Federal Government by the same State\r\nlaws adopted in each State, by a law of Congress; that none of these\r\nbodies, therefore, derive those powers from natural or necessary right,\r\nbut from express law; that Congress have no such natural or necessary\r\npower, nor any powers but such as are given them by the Constitution;\r\nthat that has given them, directly, exemption from personal arrest,\r\nexemption from question elsewhere for what is said in their House, and\r\npower over their own members and proceedings; for these no further law\r\nis necessary, the Constitution being the law; that, moreover, by that\r\narticle of the Constitution which authorizes them “to make all laws\r\nnecessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers vested by\r\nthe Constitution in them,” they may provide by law for an undisturbed\r\nexercise of their functions, e. g., for the punishment of contempts, of\r\naffrays or tumult in their presence, &c.; but, till the law be made, it\r\ndoes not exist; and does not exist, from their own neglect; that in the\r\nmean time, however, they are not unprotected, the ordinary magistrates\r\nand courts of law being open and competent to punish all unjustifiable\r\ndisturbances or defamations, and even their own sergeant, who may\r\nappoint deputies _ad libitum_ to aid him, 3 _Grey_, 59, 147, 255, is\r\nequal to small disturbances; that in requiring a previous law, the\r\nConstitution had regard to the inviolability of the citizen, as well as\r\nof the member; as, should one House, in the regular form of a bill, aim\r\nat too broad privileges, it may be checked by the other, and both by the\r\nPresident; and also as, the law being promulgated, the citizen will know\r\nhow to avoid offense. But if one branch may assume its own privileges\r\nwithout control; if it may do it on the spur of the occasion, conceal\r\nthe law in its own breast, and after the fact committed, make its\r\nsentence both the law and the judgment on that fact; if the offense is\r\nto be kept undefined, and to be declared only _ex re nata_, and\r\naccording to the passion of the moment, and there be no limitation\r\neither in the manner or measure of the punishment, the condition of the\r\ncitizen will be perilous indeed. Which of these doctrines is to prevail\r\ntime will decide. Where there is no fixed law, the judgment on any\r\nparticular case, is the law of that single case only, and dies with it.\r\nWhen a new and even similar case arises, the judgment which is to make,\r\nand at the same time apply, the law, is open to question and\r\nconsideration, as are all new laws. Perhaps Congress, in the meantime,\r\nin their care for the safety of the citizen as well as that for their\r\nown protection, may declare by law what is necessary and proper to\r\nenable them to carry into execution the powers vested in them, and\r\nthereby hang up a rule for the inspection of all, which may direct the\r\nconduct of the citizen, and at the same time test the judgments they\r\nshall themselves pronounce in their own case.]\r\n\r\nPrivilege from arrest takes place by force of the election; and before a\r\nreturn be made a member elected may be named of a committee, and is to\r\nevery extent a member, except that he cannot vote until he is sworn.\r\n_Memor._, 107, 108. _D’Ewes_, 642, _col._ 2; 643, _col._ 1. _Pet.\r\nMiscel. Parl._, 119. _Lex. Parl. c._ 23. 2 _Hats._, 22, 62.\r\n\r\nEvery man must, at his peril, take notice who are members of either\r\nHouse returned of record. _Lex. Parl._, 23; 4 _Inst._, 24.\r\n\r\nOn complaint of a breach of privilege, the party may either be summoned\r\nor sent for in custody of the sergeant. _Grey_, 88, 95.\r\n\r\nThe privilege of a member is the privilege of the House. If the member\r\nwaive it without leave, it is a ground for punishing him, but cannot in\r\neffect waive the privilege of the House. 3 _Grey_, 140, 222.\r\n\r\nFor any speech or debate in either House, they shall not be questioned\r\nin any other place. _Const. U. S., I_, 6,; _S. P. protest of the Commons\r\nto James I._, 1621; 2 _Rapin_, No. 54, pp. 211, 212. But this is\r\nrestrained to things done in the House in a parliamentary course. _1\r\nRush._, 663. For he is not to have privilege contra morem\r\nparliamentarum, to exceed the bounds and limits of his place and duty.\r\n_Com. p._\r\n\r\nIf an offense be committed by a member of the House, of which the House\r\nhas cognizance, it is an infringement of their right for any person or\r\ncourt to take notice of it, till the House has punished the offender, or\r\nreferred him to a due course. _Lex. Parl._, 63.\r\n\r\nPrivilege is in the power of the House, and is a restraint to\r\nproceedings of inferior courts, but not of the House itself. 2 _Nalson_,\r\n450; 2 _Grey_, 399. For whatever is spoken in the House is subject to\r\nthe censure of the House; and offenses of this kind have been severely\r\npunished by calling the person to the bar to make submission, committing\r\nhim to the tower, expelling the House, etc. _Scob._, 72; _L. Parl., c._\r\n22.\r\n\r\nIt is a breach of order for the Speaker to refuse to put a question\r\nwhich is in order. 2 _Hats._, 175-6; 5 _Grey_, 133.\r\n\r\nAnd even in cases of treason, felony, and breach of the peace, to which\r\nprivilege does not extend as to substance, yet in Parliament a member\r\nis privileged as to the mode of proceeding. The case is first to be laid\r\nbefore the House, that it may judge of the fact and of the grounds of\r\nthe accusation, and how far forth the manner of the trial may concern\r\ntheir privilege; otherwise it would be in the power of other branches of\r\nthe government, and even of every private man, under pretenses of\r\ntreason, etc., to take any man from his service in the House, and so as\r\nmany, one after another, as would make the House what he pleaseth. _Dec.\r\nof the Com. on the King’s declaring Sir John Hotham a traitor._ 4\r\n_Rushw._, 586. So, when a member stood indicted for felony, it was\r\nadjudged that he ought to remain of the House till conviction; for it\r\nmay be any man’s case, who is guiltless, to be accused and indicted of\r\nfelony, or the like crime. _23 El._, 1580; _D’Ewes, 283, col._ 1; _Lex.\r\nParl._, 133.\r\n\r\nWhen it is found necessary for the public service to put a member under\r\narrest, or when, on any public inquiry, matter comes out which may lead\r\nto affect the person of a member, it is the practice immediately to\r\nacquaint the House, that they may know the reasons for such a\r\nproceeding, and take such steps as they think proper. 2 _Hats._, 259. Of\r\nwhich see many examples. _Ib._, 256, 257, 258. But the communication is\r\nsubsequent to the arrest. 1 _Blackst._, 167.\r\n\r\nIt is highly expedient, says Hatsel, for the due preservation of the\r\nprivileges of the separate branches of the Legislature, that neither\r\nshould encroach on the other, or interfere in any matter depending\r\nbefore them, so as to preclude, or even influence that freedom of\r\ndebate, which is essential to a free council. They are therefore not to\r\ntake notice of any bills or other matters depending, or of votes that\r\nhave been given, or of speeches which have been held, by the members of\r\neither of the other branches of the Legislature, until the same have\r\nbeen communicated to them in the usual parliamentary manner. 2 _Hats._,\r\n252. 4 _Inst._, 15. _Seld.

Thus the king’s taking notice of\r\nthe bill for suppressing soldiers, depending before the House; his\r\nproposing a provisional clause for a bill before it was presented to him\r\nby the two Houses; his expressing displeasure against some persons for\r\nmatters moved in parliament during the debate and preparation of a bill,\r\nwere breaches of privilege; 2 _Nalson_, 347; and in 1783, December 17,\r\nit was declared a breach of fundamental privileges, etc., to report any\r\nopinion or pretended opinion of the king on any bill or proceeding\r\ndepending in either House of Parliament, with a view to influence the\r\nvotes of the members. 2 _Hats._, 251, 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.\r\n\r\nELECTIONS.\r\n\r\n[The times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators and\r\nrepresentatives shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature\r\nthereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such\r\nregulations, except as to the places of choosing senators. _Const._ I.,\r\n4.]\r\n\r\n[Each House shall be the judge of the elections, returns, and\r\nqualifications of its own members. _Const._ I., 5.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATIONS.\r\n\r\n[The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from\r\neach State, chosen by the Legislature thereof for six years; and each\r\nSenator shall have one vote.]\r\n\r\n[Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first\r\nelection, they shall be divided, as equally as may be into three\r\nclasses.

It may be attended by both Houses in a body, or by a\r\ncommittee from each House, or by the two Speakers only. An address of\r\nthe House of Commons only, may be presented by the whole House, or by\r\nthe Speaker, 9 _Grey_, 473; 1 _Chand._, 298, 301; or by such particular\r\nmembers as are of the privy council. 2 _Hats._, 278.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XI.\r\n\r\nCOMMITTEES.\r\n\r\nStanding committees, as of privileges and elections, etc., are usually\r\nappointed at the first meeting, to continue through the session. The\r\nperson first named is generally permitted to act as chairman. But this\r\nis a matter of courtesy; every committee having a right to elect their\r\nown chairman, who presides over them, puts questions, and reports their\r\nproceedings to the House. 4 _Inst._, 11, 12; _Scob._, 9; 1 _Grey_, 122.\r\n\r\nAt these committees the members are to speak standing, and not sitting;\r\nthough there is reason to conjecture it was formerly otherwise.\r\n_D’Ewes_, 630, _col._ 1; 4 _Parl. Hist._, 440; 2 _Hats._, 77.\r\n\r\nTheir proceedings are not to be published, as they are of no force till\r\nconfirmed by the House. _Rushw., part 3, vol. 2_, 74; 3 _Grey_, 401;\r\n_Scob._, 39. Nor can they receive a petition but through the House. _9\r\nGrey_, 412.\r\n\r\nWhen a committee is charged with an inquiry, if a member prove to be\r\ninvolved, they cannot proceed against him, but must make a special\r\nreport to the House; whereupon the member is heard in his place, or at\r\nthe bar, or a special authority is given to the committee to inquire\r\nconcerning him. 9 _Grey_, 523.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the House sits, and a committee is notified of it, the\r\nchairman is in duty bound to rise instantly, and the members to attend\r\nthe service of the House. 2 _Nals._, 319.\r\n\r\nIt appears that on joint committees of the Lords and Commons, each\r\ncommittee acted integrally in the following instances: 7 _Grey_, 261,\r\n278, 285, 338; 1 _Chandler_, 357, 462. In the following instances it\r\ndoes not appear whether they did or not: 6 _Grey_, 129; 7 _Grey_, 213,\r\n229, 321.[39]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XII.\r\n\r\nCOMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE.\r\n\r\nThe speech, message, and other matters of great concernment, are usually\r\nreferred to a committee of the whole house, (6 _Grey_, 311,) where\r\ngeneral principles are digested in the form of resolutions, which are\r\ndebated and amended till they get into a shape which meets the\r\napprobation of a majority. These being reported and confirmed by the\r\nHouse, are then referred to one or more select committees, according as\r\nthe subject divides itself into one or more bills. _Scob._, 36, 44.\r\nPropositions for any charge on the people are especially to be first\r\nmade in a committee of the whole. 3 _Hats._, 127. The sense of the whole\r\nis better taken in committee, because in all committees every one speaks\r\nas often as he pleases. _Scob._, 49. They generally acquiesce in the\r\nchairman named by the Speaker; but, as well as all other committees,\r\nhave a right to elect one, some member, by consent, putting the\r\nquestion. _Scob._, 36; 3 _Grey_, 301. The form of going from the House\r\ninto committee is for the Speaker, on motion, to put the question that\r\nthe House do now resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole, to take\r\ninto consideration such a matter, naming it. If determined in the\r\naffirmative, he leaves the chair and takes a seat elsewhere, as any\r\nother member; and the person appointed chairman seats himself at the\r\nclerk’s table. _Scob._, 36. Their quorum is the same as that of the\r\nHouse, and if a defect happens, the chairman, on a motion and question,\r\nrises, the Speaker resumes the chair, and the chairman can make no other\r\nreport than to inform the House of the cause of their dissolution. If a\r\nmessage is announced during a committee, the Speaker takes the chair,\r\nand receives it, because the committee cannot. 2 _Hats._, 125, 126.\r\n\r\nIn a Committee of the Whole, the tellers, on a division, differing as to\r\nnumbers, great heats and confusion arose, and danger of a decision by\r\nthe sword. The Speaker took the chair, the mace was forcibly laid on the\r\ntable: whereupon the Members retiring to their places, the Speaker told\r\nthe House “he had taken the chair without an order to bring the House\r\ninto order.” Some excepted against it; but it was generally approved, as\r\nthe only expedient to suppress the disorder. And every member was\r\nrequired, standing up in his place, to engage that he would proceed no\r\nfurther, in consequence of what had happened in the grand committee,\r\nwhich was done. 3 _Grey_, 128.\r\n\r\nA Committee of the Whole being broken up in disorder, and the chair\r\nresumed by the Speaker without an order, the House was adjourned. The\r\nnext day the committee was considered as thereby dissolved, and the\r\nsubject again before the House, and it was decided in the House, without\r\nreturning into committee. 3 _Grey_, 130.\r\n\r\nNo previous question can be put in a committee, nor can this committee\r\nadjourn as others may; but if their business is unfinished, they rise,\r\non a question, the House is resumed, and the chairman reports that the\r\nCommittee of the Whole have, according to order, had under their\r\nconsideration such a matter, and have made progress therein; but not\r\nhaving had time to go through the same, have directed him to ask leave\r\nto sit again. Whereupon a question is put upon their having leave, and\r\non the time the House will again resolve itself into a committee.\r\n_Scob._, 38. But if they have gone through the matter referred to them,\r\na member moves that the committee may rise, and the chairman report\r\ntheir proceedings to the House; which being resolved, the chairman\r\nrises, the Speaker resumes the chair, the chairman informs him that the\r\ncommittee have gone through the business referred to them, and that he\r\nis ready to make report when the House shall think proper to receive it.\r\nIf the House have time to receive it, there is usually a cry of “Now,\r\nnow,” whereupon he makes the report; but if it be late, the cry is,\r\n“To-morrow, to-morrow,” or “Monday,” etc.; or a motion is made to that\r\neffect, and a question put, that it be received to-morrow, etc. _Scob._,\r\n38.\r\n\r\nIn other things the rules of proceedings are to be the same as in the\r\nHouse. _Scob._, 39.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIII.\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF WITNESSES.\r\n\r\nCommon fame is a good ground for the House to proceed by inquiry, and\r\neven to accusation. _Resolution House of Commons, 1 Car._, 1, 1624;\r\n_Rush., L. Parl._, 115; 1 _Grey_, 16-22, 92; _Grey_, 21, 23, 27, 45.\r\n\r\nWitnesses are not to be produced but where the House has previously\r\ninstituted an inquiry (2 _Hats._, 102), nor then are orders for their\r\nattendance given blank. 3 _Grey_, 51.\r\n\r\nWhen any person is examined before a committee, or at the bar of the\r\nHouse, any member wishing to ask the person a question, must address it\r\nto the Speaker or chairman, who repeats the question to the person, or\r\nsays to him, “You hear the question--answer it.” But if the propriety of\r\nthe question be objected to, the Speaker directs the witness, counsel,\r\nand parties, to withdraw, for no question can be moved or put or debated\r\nwhile they are there. 2 _Hats._, 108. Sometimes the questions are\r\npreviously settled in writing before the witness enters. _Ib._, 106,\r\n107; 8 _Grey_, 64. The questions asked must be entered in the journals.\r\n3 _Grey_, 81. But the testimony given in answer before the House is\r\nnever written down; but before a committee it must be, for the\r\ninformation of the House, who are not present to hear it. 7 _Grey_, 52,\r\n334.\r\n\r\nIf either house have occasion for the presence of a person in custody of\r\nthe other, they ask the other their leave that he may be brought up to\r\nthem in custody. 3 _Hats._, 52.\r\n\r\nA member, in his place, gives information to the House of what he knows\r\nof any matter under hearing at the bar. _Jour. H. of C., Jan. 22,\r\n1744-45._\r\n\r\nEither house may request, but not demand, the attendance of a member of\r\nthe other. They are to make the request by message to the other house,\r\nand to express clearly the purpose of attendance, that no improper\r\nsubject of examination may be tendered to him. The House then gives\r\nleave to the member to attend, if he chooses it; waiting first to know\r\nfrom the member himself whether he chooses to attend, till which they do\r\nnot take the message into consideration. But when the peers are sitting\r\nas a court of criminal judicature, they may order attendance, unless\r\nwhere it be a case of impeachment by the Commons. There it is to be a\r\nrequest. 3 _Hats._, 17; 9 _Grey_, 306, 406; _10 Grey_, 133.\r\n\r\nCounsel are to be heard only on private, not on public bills, and on\r\nsuch points of law only as the House shall direct. _10 Grey_, 61.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIV.\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENT OF BUSINESS.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker is not precisely bound to any rules as to what bills or\r\nother matter shall be first taken up; but is left to his own discretion,\r\nunless the House on the question decide to take up a particular subject.\r\n_Hakew._, 136.\r\n\r\nA settled order of business is, however, necessary for the government of\r\nthe presiding person, and to restrain individual members from calling up\r\nfavorite measures, or matters under their special patronage, out of\r\ntheir just turn. It is useful also for directing the discretion of the\r\nHouse, when they are moved to take up a particular matter, to the\r\nprejudice of the others having priority of right to their attention in\r\nthe general order of business.\r\n\r\n[In Senate, the bills and other papers which are in possession of the\r\nHouse, and in a state to be acted on, are arranged every morning, and\r\nbrought on in the following order:]\r\n\r\n[1. Bills ready for a second reading are read, that they may be referred\r\nto committees, and so be put under way. But if, on their being read, no\r\nmotion is made for commitment, they are then laid on the table in the\r\ngeneral file, to be taken up in their just turn.]\r\n\r\n[2. After 12 o’clock, bills ready for it are put on their passage.]\r\n\r\n[3. Reports in possession of the House, which offer grounds for a bill,\r\nare to be taken up, that the bill may be ordered in.]\r\n\r\n[4. Bills or other matters before the House, and unfinished on the\r\npreceding day, whether taken up in turn or on special order, are\r\nentitled to be resumed and passed on through their present stage.]\r\n\r\n[5. These matters being dispatched, for preparing and expediting\r\nbusiness, the general file of bills and other papers is then taken up,\r\nand each article of it is brought on according to its seniority,\r\nreckoned by the date of its first introduction to the House. Reports on\r\nbills belong to the dates of their bills.]\r\n\r\n[The arrangement of the business of the Senate is now as follows:]\r\n\r\n[1. Motions previously submitted.]\r\n\r\n[2. Reports of Committees previously made.]\r\n\r\n[3. Bills from the House of Representatives, and those introduced on\r\nleave, which have been read the first time, are read the second time;\r\nand if not referred to a committee, are considered in Committee of the\r\nWhole, and proceeded with as in other cases.]\r\n\r\n[4. After twelve o’clock, engrossed bills of the Senate, and bills of\r\nthe House of Representatives, on third reading, are put on their\r\npassage.]\r\n\r\n[5. If the above are finished before one o’clock, the general file of\r\nbills, consisting of those reported from committees on the second\r\nreading, and those reported from committees after having been referred,\r\nare taken up in the order in which they were reported to the Senate by\r\nthe respective committees.]\r\n\r\n[6. At one o’clock, if no business be pending, or if no motion be called\r\nto proceed to other business, the special orders are called, at the head\r\nof which stands the unfinished business of the preceding day.]\r\n\r\n[In this way we do not waste our time in debating what shall be taken\r\nup. We do one thing at a time; follow up a subject while it is fresh,\r\nand till it is done with, clear the House of business gradatim as it is\r\nbrought on, and prevent, to a certain degree, its immense accumulation\r\ntowards the close of the session.]\r\n\r\n[Arrangement, however, can only take hold of matters in possession of\r\nthe House. New matter may be moved at any time when no question is\r\nbefore the House. Such are original motions and reports on bills. Such\r\nare bills from the other House, which are received at all times, and\r\nreceive their first reading as soon as the question then before the\r\nHouse is disposed of; and bills brought in on leave, which are read\r\nfirst whenever presented. So messages from the other House respecting\r\namendments to bills are taken up as soon as the House is clear of a\r\nquestion, unless they require to be printed, for better consideration.\r\nOrders of the day may be called for, even when another question is\r\nbefore the House.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XV.\r\n\r\nORDER.\r\n\r\n[Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings; punish its\r\nmembers for disorderly behavior; and, with the concurrence of\r\ntwo-thirds, expel a member. _Const._, I, 5.]\r\n\r\nIn Parliament, “Instances make order,” per Speaker Onslow. 2 _Hats._,\r\n141. But what is done only by one Parliament, cannot be called custom of\r\nParliament; by Prynne. 1 _Grey_, 52.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVI.\r\n\r\nORDER RESPECTING PAPERS.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk is to let no journals, records, accounts or papers, be taken\r\nfrom the table or out of his custody. 2 _Hats._, 193, 194.\r\n\r\nMr. Prynne having at a Committee of the Whole amended a mistake in a\r\nbill without order or knowledge of the committee, was reprimanded. _1\r\nChand._, 77.\r\n\r\nA bill being missing, the House resolved that a protestation should be\r\nmade and subscribed by the members “before Almighty God and this\r\nhonorable House, that neither myself nor any other to my knowledge have\r\ntaken away, or do at this present conceal a bill entitled,” etc. _5\r\nGrey_, 202.\r\n\r\nAfter a bill is engrossed, it is put into the Speaker’s hands, and he is\r\nnot to let any one have it to look into. _Town._, _col._ 200.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVII.\r\n\r\nORDER IN DEBATE.\r\n\r\nWhen the Speaker is seated in his chair, every member is to sit in his\r\nplace. _Scob._, 6; 3 _Grey_, 403.\r\n\r\nWhen any member means to speak, he is to stand up in his place,\r\nuncovered, and to address himself, not to the House, or any particular\r\nmember, but to the speaker, who calls him by his name, that the House\r\nmay take notice who it is that speaks. _Scob._, 6; _D’Ewes_, 487; _col._\r\n1; 2 _Hats._, 77; 4 _Grey_, 66; 8 _Grey_, 108. But members who are\r\nindisposed may be indulged to speak sitting. 2 _Hats._, 75; 1 _Grey_,\r\n143.\r\n\r\n[In Senate, every member, when he speaks, shall address the chair,\r\nstanding in his place, and when he has finished, shall sit down. _Rule\r\n3._]\r\n\r\nWhen a member stands up to speak, no question is to be put, but he is\r\nto be heard unless the House overrules him. 4 _Grey_, 390; 5 _Grey_, 6,\r\n143.\r\n\r\nIf two or more rise to speak nearly together, the Speaker determines who\r\nwas first up, and calls him by name; whereupon he proceeds, unless he\r\nvoluntarily sits down and gives way to the other. But sometimes the\r\nHouse does not acquiesce in the Speaker’s decision, in which case the\r\nquestion is put, “Which member was first up?” 2 _Hats._, 76; _Scob._, 7;\r\n_D’Ewes._, 434, _col._ 1, 2.\r\n\r\n[In the Senate of the United States, the President’s decision is without\r\nappeal. Their rule is in these words: _When two members rise at the same\r\ntime, the President shall name the person to speak; but in all cases_\r\nthe member who shall first rise and address the chair, shall speak\r\nfirst. _Rule 5._]\r\n\r\nNo man may speak more than once on the same bill on the same day; or\r\neven on another day, if the debate be adjourned. But if it be read more\r\nthan once in the same day, he may speak once at every reading. _Co._,\r\n12, 115; _Hakew._, 148; _Scob._, 58; 2 _Hats._, 75. Even a change of\r\nopinion does not give a right to be heard a second time. _Smyth’s Comw.,\r\nL._ 2, _c._ 3; _Arcan Parl._, 17.\r\n\r\n[The corresponding rule of the Senate is in these words: No member shall\r\nspeak more than twice, in any one debate on the same day, without leave\r\nof the Senate. _Rule 4._]\r\n\r\nBut he may be permitted to speak again to a clear matter of fact (_3\r\nGrey_, 357, 416); or merely to explain himself (2 _Hats._, 73) in some\r\nmaterial part of his speech (_Ib._ 75); or to the manner of words of the\r\nquestion, keeping himself to that only, and not traveling into the\r\nmerits of it (_Memorials in Hakew._, 29), or to the orders of the House,\r\nif they be transgressed, keeping within that line, and not falling into\r\nthe matter itself. _Mem. Hakew._, 30, 31.\r\n\r\nBut if the Speaker rise to speak, the member standing up ought to sit\r\ndown, that he may be first heard. _Town. col._, 205; _Hale Parl._, 133;\r\n_Mem. in Hakew._, 30, 31. Nevertheless, though the Speaker may of right\r\nspeak to matters of order, and be first heard, he is restrained from\r\nspeaking on any other subject, except where the House have occasion for\r\nfacts within his knowledge; then he may with their leave, state the\r\nmatter of fact. 3 _Grey_, 38.\r\n\r\nNo one is to speak impertinently or beside the question, superfluously\r\nor tediously. _Scob._, 31, 33; 2 _Hats._, 166, 168; _Hale Parl._, 133.\r\n\r\nNo person is to use indecent language against the proceedings of the\r\nHouse; no prior determination of which is to be reflected on by any\r\nmember, unless he means to conclude with a motion to rescind it. _2\r\nHats._, 169, 170; _Rushw._, _p._ 3, _v._ 1, _fol._ 42. But while a\r\nproposition under consideration is still in _fieri_, though it has even\r\nbeen reported by a committee, reflections on it are no reflections on\r\nthe House. 9 _Grey_, 508.\r\n\r\nNo person in speaking, is to mention a member then present by his name,\r\nbut to describe him by his seat in the House, or who spoke last, or on\r\nthe other side of the question, etc. (_Mem. in Hakew._, 3; _Smyth’s\r\nComw._, _L._ 2, _c._ 3); nor to digress from the matter to fall upon the\r\nperson (_Scob._, 31; _Hale Parl._, 133; 2 _Hats._, 166) by speaking\r\nreviling, nipping or unmanly words against a particular member. _Smyth’s\r\nComw._, _L._ 2, _c._ 3. The consequences of a measure may be reprobated\r\nin strong terms; but to arraign the motives of those who propose to\r\nadvocate it, is a personality, and against order. _Qui digreditur a\r\nmateria ad personam_, Mr. Speaker ought to suppress. _Ord. Som., 1604,\r\nApr. 19._\r\n\r\n[* * * When a member shall be called to order by the President or a\r\nSenator, he shall sit down, and shall not proceed without leave of the\r\nSenate; and every question of order shall be decided by the President,\r\nwithout debate, subject to an appeal to the Senate; and the President\r\nmay call for the sense of the Senate on any question of order. _Rule\r\n6._]\r\n\r\n[No member shall speak to another or otherwise interrupt the business of\r\nthe Senate, or read any newspaper while the journals or public papers\r\nare reading, or when any member is speaking in any debate. _Rule 2._]\r\n\r\nNo one is to disturb another in his speech by hissing, coughing,\r\nspitting (6 _Grey_, 332; _Scob._, 8; _D’Ewes_, 332, _col._ 1, 640,\r\n_col._ 1) speaking or whispering to another (_Scob._, 6; _D’Ewes_, 487,\r\n_col._ 1); nor stand up to interrupt him (_Town._, _col._ 205; _Mem. in\r\nHakew._, 31); nor to push between the Speaker and the speaking member,\r\nnor to go across the house (_Scob._, 6), or to walk up and down it, or\r\nto take books or papers from the table, or write there. 2 _Hats._, 171.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if a member finds that it is not the inclination of the\r\nHouse to hear him, and that by conversation or any other noise they\r\nendeavor to drown his voice, it is his most prudent way to submit to the\r\npleasure of the House, and sit down; for it scarcely ever happens that\r\nthey are guilty of this piece of ill manners without sufficient reason,\r\nor inattentive to a member who says anything worth their hearing. _2\r\nHats._, 77, 78.\r\n\r\nIf repeated calls do not produce order, the Speaker may call by his name\r\nany member obstinately persisting in irregularity; whereupon the House\r\nmay require the member to withdraw. He is then to be heard in\r\nexculpation, and to withdraw. Then the Speaker states the offense\r\ncommitted, and the House considers the degree of punishment they will\r\ninflict. 3 _Hats._, 167, 7, 8, 172.\r\n\r\nFor instances of assaults and affrays in the House of Commons, and the\r\nproceedings thereon, see 1 _Pet. Misc._, 82; 3 _Grey_, 128; 4 _Grey_,\r\n328; 5 _Grey_, 382; 6 _Grey_, 254; _10 Grey_, 8.\r\n\r\nWhenever warm words or an assault have passed between members, the\r\nHouse, for the protection of their members, requires them to declare in\r\ntheir places not to prosecute any quarrel (3 _Grey_, 127, 293; 5 _Grey_,\r\n280); or orders them to attend the Speaker, who is to accommodate their\r\ndifferences, and report to the House (3 _Grey_, 419); and they are put\r\nunder restraint if they refuse, or until they do. 9 _Grey_, 234, 312.\r\n\r\nDisorderly words are not to be noticed till the member has finished his\r\nspeech. 5 _Grey_, 356; 6 _Grey_, 60. Then the person objecting to them,\r\nand desiring them to be taken down by the clerk at the table, must\r\nrepeat them. The Speaker then may direct the clerk to take them down in\r\nhis minutes; but if he thinks them not disorderly, he delays the\r\ndirection. If the call becomes pretty general, he orders the clerk to\r\ntake them down, as stated by the objecting member. They are then part of\r\nhis minutes, and when read to the offending member, he may deny they\r\nwere his words, and the House must then decide by a question whether\r\nthey are his words or not. Then the member may justify them, or explain\r\nthe sense in which he used them, or apologize. If the House is\r\nsatisfied, no further proceeding is necessary. But if two members still\r\ninsist to take the sense of the House, the member must withdraw before\r\nthat question is stated, and then the sense of the House is to be taken.\r\n2 _Hats._, 199; 4 _Grey_, 170; 6 _Grey_, 59. When any member has spoken,\r\nor other business intervenes, after offensive words spoken, they cannot\r\nbe taken notice of for censure. And this is for the common security of\r\nall, and to prevent mistakes which must happen if words are not taken\r\ndown immediately. Formerly they might be taken down at any time the same\r\nday. 2 _Hats._, 196; _Mem. in Hakew._, 71; 3 _Grey_, 48; 9 _Grey_, 514.\r\n\r\nDisorderly words spoken in a committee must be written down as in the\r\nHouse; but the committee can only report them to the House for\r\nanimadversion. 6 _Grey_, 46.\r\n\r\n[The rule of the Senate says: “If the member be called to order by a\r\nsenator for words spoken, the exceptional words shall immediately be\r\ntaken down in writing, that the President may be better enabled to judge\r\nof the matter.” _Rule 7._]\r\n\r\nIn Parliament, to speak irreverently or seditiously against the King, is\r\nagainst order. _Smyth’s Comw._, _L._ 2, _c._ 3; 2 _Hats._, 170.\r\n\r\nIt is a breach of order in debate to notice what has been said on the\r\nsame subject in the other house, or the particular votes or majorities\r\non it there; because the opinion of each house should be left to its own\r\nindependency, not to be influenced by the proceedings of the other; and\r\nthe quoting them might beget reflections leading to a misunderstanding\r\nbetween the two houses. 8 _Grey_, 22.\r\n\r\nNeither house can exercise any authority over a member or officer of the\r\nother, but should complain to the house of which he is, and leave the\r\npunishment to them. Where the complaint is of words disrespectfully\r\nspoken by a member of another house, it is difficult to obtain\r\npunishment, because of the rules supposed necessary to be observed (as\r\nto the immediate noting down of words) for the security of members.\r\nTherefore it is the duty of the House, and more particularly of the\r\nSpeaker, to interfere immediately, and not to permit expressions to go\r\nunnoticed, which may give a ground of complaint to the other house, and\r\nintroduce proceedings and mutual accusations between the two houses,\r\nwhich can hardly be terminated without difficulty and disorder. _3\r\nHats._, 51.\r\n\r\nNo member may be present when a bill or any business concerning himself\r\nis debating; nor is any member to speak to the merits of it till he\r\nwithdraws. 2 _Hats._, 219. The rule is, that if a charge against a\r\nmember arise out of a report of a committee, or examination of witnesses\r\nin the House, as the member knows from that to what points he is to\r\ndirect his exculpation, he may be heard to those points before any\r\nquestion is moved or stated against him. He is then to be heard, and\r\nwithdraw before any question is moved. But if the question itself is the\r\ncharge, as for breach of order, or matter arising in the debate, then\r\nthe charge must be stated, (that is, the question must be moved,)\r\nhimself heard, and then to withdraw. 2 _Hats._, 121, 122.\r\n\r\nWhere the private interests of a member are concerned in a bill or\r\nquestion, he is to withdraw. And where such an interest has appeared,\r\nhis voice has been disallowed, even after a division. In a case so\r\ncontrary, not only to the laws of decency, but to the fundamental\r\nprinciple of the social compact which denies to any man to be a judge in\r\nhis own cause, it is for the honor of the House that this rule of\r\nimmemorial observance, should be strictly adhered to. 2 _Hats._, 119,\r\n121; 6 _Grey_, 368.\r\n\r\nNo member is to come into the house with his head covered, nor to\r\nremove from one place to another with his hat on, nor is to put on his\r\nhat in coming in or removing, until he be set down in his place.\r\n_Scob._, 6.\r\n\r\nA question of order may be adjourned to give time to look into\r\nprecedents. 2 _Hats._, 118.\r\n\r\nIn Parliament all decisions of the Speaker may be controlled by the\r\nHouse. 3 _Grey_, 319.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVIII.\r\n\r\nORDERS OF THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nOf right, the doors of the House ought not to be shut, but to be kept by\r\nporters, or sergeant-at-arms, assigned for that purpose. _Mod. Ten.\r\nParl._, 23.\r\n\r\n[By the rules of the Senate, on motion made and seconded to shut the\r\ndoors of the Senate on the discussion of any business which may, in the\r\nopinion of a member, require secrecy, the President shall direct the\r\ngallery to be cleared; and during the discussion of such motion the\r\ndoors shall remain shut. _Rule 18._]\r\n\r\nNo motion shall be deemed in order to admit any person or persons\r\nwhatsoever, within the doors of the Senate chamber, to present any\r\npetition, memorial or address, or to hear any such read. _Rule 19._\r\n\r\n[The only case where a member has a right to insist on anything, is\r\nwhere he calls for the execution of a subsisting order of the House.\r\nHere, there having been already a resolution, any person has a right to\r\ninsist that the Speaker, or any other whose duty it is, shall carry it\r\ninto execution; and no debate or delay can be had on it. Thus any member\r\nhas a right to have the House or gallery cleared of strangers, an order\r\nexisting for that purpose; or to have the House told where there is not\r\na quorum present. 2 _Hats._, 87, 129. How far an order of the House is\r\nbinding. See _Hakew._, 392.]\r\n\r\nBut where an order is made that any particular matter be taken up on a\r\nparticular day, there a question is to be put, when it is called for,\r\nwhether the House will now proceed to that matter? Where orders of the\r\nday are on important or interesting matter, they ought not to be\r\nproceeded on till an hour at which the House is usually full, [_which in\r\nSenate is at noon_.]\r\n\r\nOrders of the day may be discharged at any time, and a new one made for\r\na different day. 3 _Grey_, 48, 313.\r\n\r\nWhen a session is drawing to a close, and the important bills are all\r\nbrought in, the House, in order to prevent interruption by further\r\nunimportant bills, sometimes come to a resolution that no new bill be\r\nbrought in, except it be sent from the other house. 3 _Grey_, 156.\r\n\r\nAll orders of the House determine with the session; and one taken under\r\nsuch an order may, after the session is ended, be discharged on a habeas\r\ncorpus. _Raym._, 120; _Jacob’s L. D. by Ruffhead_; _Parliament, 1 Lev._,\r\n165, (_Pritchard’s case_.)\r\n\r\n[Where the Constitution authorizes each House to determine the rules of\r\nits proceedings, it must mean in those cases (legislative, executive or\r\njudiciary) submitted to them by the Constitution, or in something\r\nrelating to these, and necessary towards their execution. But orders and\r\nresolutions are sometimes entered in the journals, having no relation to\r\nthese, such as acceptances of invitations to attend orations, to take\r\npart in processions, etc. These must be understood to be merely\r\nconventional among those who are willing to participate in the ceremony,\r\nand are, therefore, perhaps, improperly placed among the records of the\r\nHouse.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIX.\r\n\r\nPETITIONS.\r\n\r\nA petition prays something. A remonstrance has no prayer. 1 _Grey_, 58.\r\n\r\nPetitions must be subscribed by the petitioners (_Scob._, 87; _L.\r\nParl._, _c._ 22; 9 _Grey_, 362), unless they are attending (1 _Grey_,\r\n401); or unable to sign, and averred by a member (3 _Grey_, 418). But a\r\npetition not subscribed, but which the member presenting it affirmed to\r\nbe all in the handwriting of the petitioner, and his name written in the\r\nbeginning, was on the question (Mar. 14, 1800) received by the Senate.\r\nThe averment of a member, or of somebody withoutdoors, that they know\r\nthe handwriting of the petitioners, is necessary, if it be questioned\r\n(6 _Grey_, 36). It must be presented by a member, not by the\r\npetitioners, and must be opened by him holding it in his hand. _10\r\nGrey_, 57.\r\n\r\n[Before any petition or memorial addressed to the Senate shall be\r\nreceived and read at the table, whether the same shall be introduced by\r\nthe President or a member, a brief statement of the contents of the\r\npetition or memorial shall verbally be made by the introducer. _Rule\r\n24._]\r\n\r\nRegularly, a motion for receiving it must be made and seconded, and a\r\nquestion put, whether it shall be received? But a cry from the House of\r\n“Received,” or even its silence, dispenses with the formality of this\r\nquestion; it is then to be read at the table, and disposed of.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XX.\r\n\r\nMOTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhen a motion has been made it is not to be put to the question, or\r\ndebated until it is seconded. _Scob._, 21.\r\n\r\n[The Senate say: No motion shall be debated until the same shall be\r\nseconded. _Rule 9._]\r\n\r\nIt is then, and not till then, in possession of the House, and cannot be\r\nwithdrawn but by leave of the House. It is to be put into writing, if\r\nthe House or Speaker require it, and must be read to the House by the\r\nSpeaker as often as any member desires it for his information. _2\r\nHats._, 82.\r\n\r\n[The rule of the Senate is: When a motion shall be made and seconded, it\r\nshall be reduced to writing, if desired by the President or any member,\r\ndelivered in at the table, and read, before the same shall be debated.\r\n* * * _Rule 10._]\r\n\r\nIt might be asked, whether a motion for adjournment or for the orders of\r\nthe day, can be made by any one member while another is speaking. It\r\ncannot. When two members offer to speak, he who rose first is to be\r\nheard; and it is a breach of order in another to interrupt him, unless\r\nby calling him to order if he departs from it. And the question of order\r\nbeing decided, he is still to be heard through. A call for adjournment,\r\nor for the order of the day, or for the question, by gentlemen from\r\ntheir seats, is not a motion. No motion can be made without arising and\r\naddressing the chair. Such calls are themselves breaches of order,\r\nwhich, though the member who has risen may respect as an expression of\r\nimpatience of the House against further debate, yet, if he chooses, he\r\nhas a right to go on.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXI.\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhen the House commands, it is by an “order.” But facts, principles, and\r\ntheir own opinions and purposes, are expressed in the form of\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\n[A resolution for an allowance of money to the clerks being moved, it\r\nwas objected to as not in order, and so ruled by the Chair; but on an\r\nappeal to the Senate (_i. e._, a call for their sense by the President,\r\non account of doubt in his mind, according to rule 26), the decision was\r\noverruled, _Jour. Sen., June 1, 1796_. I presume the doubt was, whether\r\nan allowance of money could be made otherwise than by bill.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXII.\r\n\r\nBILLS.\r\n\r\n[Every bill shall receive three readings previous to its being passed;\r\nand the President shall give notice at each whether it be first, second\r\nor third; which readings shall be on three different days, unless the\r\nSenate unanimously direct otherwise. * * * _Rule 26._]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXIII.\r\n\r\nBILLS--LEAVE TO BRING IN.\r\n\r\n[One day’s notice, at least, shall be given of an intended motion for\r\nleave to bring in a bill. _Rule 25._]\r\n\r\nWhen a member desires to bring in a bill on any subject, he states to\r\nthe House in general terms the causes for doing it, and concludes by\r\nmoving for leave to bring in a bill entitled, etc. Leave being given on\r\nthe question, a committee is appointed to prepare and bring in the bill.\r\nThe mover and seconder are always appointed of this committee, and one\r\nor more in addition. _Hakew._, 122; _Scob._, 40.\r\n\r\nIt is to be presented fairly written, without any other erasure or\r\ninterlineation, or the Speaker may refuse it. _Scob._, 41; 1 _Grey_, 82,\r\n84.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXIV.\r\n\r\nBILLS--FIRST READING.\r\n\r\nWhen a bill is first presented, the clerk reads it at the table, and\r\nhands it to the Speaker, who, rising, states to the House the title of\r\nthe bill; that this is the first time of reading it; and the question\r\nwill be, whether it shall be read a second time? then sitting down to\r\ngive an opening for objections. If none be made, he rises again, and\r\nputs the question, whether it shall be read a second time? _Hakew._,\r\n137, 141. A bill cannot be amended on the first reading, (6 _Grey_,\r\n286;) nor is it usual for it to be opposed then, but it may be done and\r\nrejected. _D’Ewes_, 335, _col_ 1; 3 _Hats._, 198.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXV.\r\n\r\nBILLS--SECOND READING.\r\n\r\nThe second reading must regularly be on another day. _Hakew._, 143. It\r\nis done by the Clerk at the table, who then hands it to the Speaker. The\r\nSpeaker rising, states to the House the title of the bill; that this is\r\nthe second time of reading it; and that the question will be, whether it\r\nshall be committed or engrossed and read a third time? But if the bill\r\ncame from the other House, as it always comes engrossed, he states that\r\nthe question will be, whether it shall be read a third time? and before\r\nhe has so reported the state of the bill, no one is to speak to it.\r\n_Hakew._, 143, 146.\r\n\r\n[In the Senate of the United States, the President reports the title of\r\nthe bill; that this is the second time of reading it; that it is now to\r\nbe considered as in a Committee of the Whole; and the question will be,\r\nwhether it shall be read a third time? or that it may be referred to a\r\nspecial committee?]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXVI.\r\n\r\nBILLS--COMMITMENT.\r\n\r\nIf on motion and question it be decided that the bill shall be\r\ncommitted, it may then be moved to be referred to Committee of the Whole\r\nHouse, or to a special committee. If the latter, the Speaker proceeds to\r\nname the committee. Any member also may name a single person, and the\r\nclerk is to write him down as of the committee. But the House have a\r\ncontrolling power over the names and number, if a question be moved\r\nagainst anyone; and may in any case put in and put out whom they please.\r\n\r\nThose who take exceptions to some particulars in the bill are to be of\r\nthe committee, but none who speak directly against the body of the bill;\r\nfor he that would totally destroy will not amend it, (_Hakew._, 146;\r\n_Town._, _col._ 208; _D’Ewes_, 634, _col._ 2; _Scob._, 47;) or, as it is\r\nsaid, (5 _Grey_, 145,) the child is not to be put to a nurse that cares\r\nnot for it, (6 _Grey_, 373.) It is therefore a constant rule “that no\r\nman is to be employed in any matter who has declared himself against\r\nit.” And when any member, who is against the bill, hears himself named\r\nto its committee, he ought to ask to be excused. Thus (March 7, 1606)\r\nMr. Hadley was, on the question being put, excused from being of a\r\ncommittee, declaring himself to be against the matter itself. _Scob._,\r\n46.\r\n\r\n[No bill shall be committed or amended until it shall have been twice\r\nread; after which it may be referred to a committee. _Rule 27._]\r\n\r\n[In the appointment of the standing committees, the Senate will proceed,\r\nby ballot, severally to appoint the Chairman of each committee; and\r\nthen, by one ballot, the other members necessary to complete the same;\r\nand a majority of the whole number of votes given shall be necessary to\r\nthe choice of a chairman of a standing committee. All other committees\r\nshall be appointed by ballot, and a plurality of votes shall make a\r\nchoice. When any subject or matter shall have been referred to a\r\ncommittee, any other subject or matter of a similar nature, may, on\r\nmotion, be referred to such committee. _Rule 34._]\r\n\r\nThe clerk may deliver the bill to any member of the committee, (_Town._,\r\n_col._ 138;) but it is usual to deliver it to him who is first named.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the House has ordered a committee to withdraw immediately\r\ninto the Committee Chamber, and act on and bring back the bill, sitting\r\nin the House. _Scob._, 48. A committee meet when and where they please,\r\nif the House has not ordered time and place for them, (6 _Grey_, 370;)\r\nbut they can only act when together, and not by separate consultation\r\nand consent--nothing being the report of the committee but what has been\r\nagreed to in committee actually assembled.\r\n\r\nA majority of the committee constitutes a quorum for business.\r\n_Elsynge’s Method of Passing Bills_, 11.\r\n\r\nAny member of the House may be present at any select committee, but\r\ncannot vote, and must give place to all of the committee, and sit below\r\nthem. _Elsynge_, 12; _Scob._, 49.\r\n\r\nThe committee have full power over the bill or other paper committed to\r\nthem, except that they cannot change the title or subject. 8 _Grey_,\r\n228.\r\n\r\nThe paper before a committee, whether select or of the whole, may be a\r\nbill, resolutions, draught of an address, etc., and it may either\r\noriginate with them or be referred to them. In every case the whole\r\npaper is read first by the clerk, and then by the chairman, by\r\nparagraphs, (_Scob._, 49,) pausing at the end of each paragraph, and\r\nputting questions for amending, if proposed. In the case of resolutions\r\non distinct subjects, originating with themselves, a question is put on\r\neach separately, as amended or unamended, and no final question on the\r\nwhole. (3 _Hats._, 276;) but if they relate to the same subject, a\r\nquestion is put on the whole. If it be a bill, draught of an address, or\r\nother paper originating with them, they proceed by paragraphs; putting\r\nquestions for amending either by insertion or striking out, if proposed;\r\nbut no question on agreeing to the paragraphs separately; this is\r\nreserved to the close, when a question is put on the whole for agreeing\r\nto it as amended or unamended. But if it be a paper referred to them,\r\nthey proceed to put questions of amendment, if proposed, but no final\r\nquestion on the whole, because all parts of the paper, having been\r\nadopted by the House, stand, of course, unless altered or struck out by\r\na vote. Even if they are opposed to the whole paper, and think it cannot\r\nbe made good by amendments, they cannot reject it, but must report it\r\nback to the House without amendments, and there make their opposition.\r\n\r\nThe natural order in considering and amending any paper is, to begin at\r\nthe beginning, and proceed through it by paragraphs, and this order is\r\nso strictly adhered to in Parliament, that when a latter part has been\r\namended, you cannot recur back and make any alterations in a former\r\npart. 2 _Hats._, 90. In numerous assemblies this restraint is doubtless\r\nimportant. [But in the Senate of the United States, though in the main\r\nwe consider and amend the paragraphs in their natural order, yet\r\nrecurrences are indulged; and they seem, on the whole, in that small\r\nbody, to produce advantages overweighing their inconveniences.]\r\n\r\nTo this natural order of beginning at the beginning, there is a single\r\nexception found in parliamentary usage. When a bill is taken up in\r\ncommittee, or on its second reading, they postpone the preamble till the\r\nother parts of the bill are gone through. The reason is, that on\r\nconsideration of the body of the bill, such alterations may therein be\r\nmade as may also occasion the alteration of the preamble. _Scob._, 50;\r\n7 _Grey_, 431.\r\n\r\nOn this head the following case occurred in the Senate, March 6, 1800: A\r\nresolution which had no preamble having been already amended by the\r\nHouse so that a few words only of the original remained in it, a motion\r\nwas made to prefix a preamble, which having an aspect very different\r\nfrom the resolution, the mover intimated that he should afterwards\r\npropose a corresponding amendment in the body of the resolution. It was\r\nobjected that a preamble could not be taken up till the body of the\r\nresolution is done with; but the preamble was received, because we are\r\nin fact through the body of the resolution; we have amended that as far\r\nas amendments have offered, and, indeed, till little of the original is\r\nleft. It is the proper time, therefore, to consider a preamble; and\r\nwhether the one offered be consistent with the resolution is for the\r\nHouse to determine. The mover, indeed, has intimated that he shall offer\r\na subsequent proposition for the body of the resolution; but the House\r\nis not in possession of it; it remains in his breast, and may be\r\nwithheld. The rules of the House can only operate on what is before\r\nthem. [The practice of the Senate, too, allows recurrences backwards and\r\nforwards, for the purposes of amendment, not permitting amendments in a\r\nsubsequent to preclude those in a prior part, or _e converso_.]\r\n\r\nWhen the committee is through the whole, a member moves that the\r\ncommittee may rise, and the chairman report the paper to the House, with\r\nor without amendments, as the case may be. 2 _Hats._, 289, 292; _Scob._,\r\n53; 2 _Hats._, 290; 8 _Scob._, 50.\r\n\r\nWhen a vote is once passed in a committee, it cannot be altered but by\r\nthe House, their votes being binding on themselves. _1607, June 4._\r\n\r\nThe committee may not erase, interline, or blot the bill itself; but\r\nmust, in a paper by itself, set down the amendments, stating the words\r\nwhich are to be inserted or omitted (_Scob._, 50), and where, by\r\nreferences to the page, line, and word of the bill. _Scob._, 50.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXVII.\r\n\r\nREPORT OF COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the committee, standing in his place, informs the House\r\nthat the committee, to whom was referred such a bill, have, according to\r\norder, had the same under consideration, and have directed him to report\r\nthe same without any amendment or with sundry amendments (as the case\r\nmay be), which he is ready to do when the House pleases to receive it.\r\nAnd he or any other may move that it be now received; but the cry of\r\n“now, now,” from the House, generally dispenses with the formality of a\r\nmotion and question. He then reads the amendment, with the coherence in\r\nthe bill, and opens the alterations and the reasons of the committee for\r\nsuch amendments, until he has gone through the whole. He then delivers\r\nit at the clerk’s table, where the amendments reported are read by the\r\nclerk without the coherence; whereupon the papers lie upon the table\r\ntill the House, at its convenience, shall take up the report. _Scob._,\r\n52; _Hakew._, 148.\r\n\r\nThe report being made, the committee is dissolved and can act no more\r\nwithout a new power. _Scob._, 51. But it may be revived by a vote, and\r\nthe same matter recommitted to them. 4 _Grey_, 361.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXVIII.\r\n\r\nBILL--RECOMMITMENT.\r\n\r\nAfter a bill has been committed and reported, it ought not in an\r\nordinary course to be recommitted; but in cases of importance, and for\r\nspecial reasons, it is sometimes recommitted, and usually to the same\r\ncommittee. _Hakew._, 151. If a report be recommitted before agreed to in\r\nthe House, what has passed in committee is of no validity; the whole\r\nquestion is again before the committee, and a new resolution must be\r\nagain moved, as if nothing had passed. 2 _Hats._, 131--_note_.\r\n\r\nIn Senate, January, 1800, the salvage bill was recommitted three times\r\nafter the commitment.\r\n\r\nA particular clause of a bill may be committed without the whole bill\r\n(3 _Hats._, 131); or so much of a paper to one and so much to another\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXIX.\r\n\r\nBILL--REPORTS TAKEN UP.\r\n\r\nWhen the report of a paper originating with a committee is taken up by\r\nthe House, they proceed exactly as in committee. Here, as in committee,\r\nwhen the paragraphs have, on distinct questions, been agreed to\r\n_seriatim_ (5 _Grey_, 366; 6 _Grey_, 368; 8 _Grey_, 47, 104, 360; _1\r\nTorbuck’s Deb._, 125; 3 _Hats._, 348), no question need be put on the\r\nwhole report. 5 _Grey_, 381.\r\n\r\nOn taking up a bill reported with amendments, the amendments only are\r\nread by the Clerk. The Speaker then reads the first, and puts it to the\r\nquestion, and so on until the whole are adopted or rejected, before any\r\nother amendment be admitted, except it be an amendment to an amendment.\r\n_Elsynge’s Mem._, 53. When through the amendments of the committee, the\r\nSpeaker pauses, and gives time for amendments to be proposed in the\r\nHouse to the body of the bill as he does also if it has been reported\r\nwithout amendments, putting no questions but on amendments proposed; and\r\nwhen through the whole, he puts the question whether the bill be read\r\nthe third time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXX.\r\n\r\nQUASI-COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\nIf on motion and question the bill be not committed, or if no\r\nproposition for commitment be made, then the proceedings in the Senate\r\nof the United States and in Parliament are totally different. The former\r\nshall be first stated.\r\n\r\n[The 28th rule of the Senate says: “All bills on a second reading shall\r\nfirst be considered by the Senate in the same manner as if the Senate\r\nwere in Committee of the Whole, before they shall be taken up and\r\nproceeded on by the Senate agreeably to the standing rules, unless\r\notherwise ordered;” (that is to say, unless ordered to be referred to a\r\nspecial committee.) And when the Senate shall consider a treaty, bill,\r\nor resolution, as in Committee of the Whole, the Vice-President or\r\nPresident _pro tempore_ may call a member to fill the chair during the\r\ntime the Senate shall remain in Committee of the Whole; and the chairman\r\n(so called) shall, during such time, have the powers of a President _pro\r\ntempore_.]\r\n\r\n[The proceedings of the Senate, as in a Committee of the Whole, or in\r\nQuasi-Committee, are precisely as in a real Committee of the Whole,\r\ntaking no questions but on amendments. When through the whole, they\r\nconsider the Quasi-Committee as risen, the House resumes without any\r\nmotion, question, or resolution to that effect, and the President\r\nreports that “The House acting as in Committee of the Whole, have had\r\nunder their consideration the bill entitled, etc., and have made sundry\r\namendments, which he will now report to the House.” The bill is then\r\nbefore them, as it would have been if reported from a committee, and the\r\nquestions are regularly to be put again on every amendment; which being\r\ngone through, the President pauses to give time to the House to propose\r\namendments to the body of the bill, and when through, puts the question\r\nwhether it shall be read a third time.]\r\n\r\n[After progress in amending the bill in Quasi-Committee, a motion may be\r\nmade to refer it to a special committee. If the motion prevails, it is\r\nequivalent in effect to the several votes, that the committee rise, the\r\nHouse resume itself, discharge the Committee of the Whole, and refer the\r\nbill to a special committee. In that case, the amendments already made,\r\nfall. But if the motion falls, the Quasi-Committee stands _in statu\r\nquo_.]\r\n\r\n[How far does this 28th rule subject the House, when in Quasi-Committee,\r\nto the laws which regulate the proceedings of Committees of the Whole?]\r\nThe particulars in which these differ from proceedings in the House are\r\nthe following: 1. In a committee every member may speak as often as he\r\npleases. 2. The votes of a committee may be rejected or altered when\r\nreported to the House. 3. A committee, even of the Whole, cannot refer\r\nany matter to another committee. 4. In a committee no previous question\r\ncan be taken: the only means to avoid an improper discussion is to move\r\nthat the committee rise; and if it be apprehended that the same\r\ndiscussion will be attempted on returning into committee, the House can\r\ndischarge them, and proceed itself on the business, keeping down the\r\nimproper discussions by the previous question. 5. A committee cannot\r\npunish a breach of order in the House, or in the gallery. 9 _Grey_, 113.\r\nIt can only rise and report it to the House, who may proceed to punish.\r\n[The first and second of these peculiarities attach to the\r\nQuasi-Committee of the Senate, as every day’s practice proves, and seem\r\nto be the only ones to which the 28th rule meant to subject them; for it\r\ncontinues to be a House, and therefore, though it acts in some respects\r\nas a committee, in others it preserves its character as House. Thus: 3.\r\nIt is in the daily habit of referring its business to a special\r\ncommittee. 4. It admits of the previous question; if it did not, it\r\nwould have no means of preventing an improper discussion, not being\r\nable, as a committee is, to avoid it by returning into the House, for\r\nthe moment it would resume the same subject there, the 28th rule\r\ndeclares it again a Quasi-Committee. 5. It would doubtless exercise its\r\npowers as a house on any breach of order. 6. It takes a question by yea\r\nand nay, as the House does. 7. It receives messages from the President\r\nand the other House. 8. In the midst of a debate it receives a motion to\r\nadjourn, and adjourns as a house, not a committee.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXI.\r\n\r\nBILLS--SECOND READING IN THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nIn Parliament, after the bill has been read a second time, if on the\r\nmotion and question it be not committed, or if no proposition for\r\ncommitment be made, the Speaker reads it by paragraphs, pausing between\r\neach, but putting no question but on amendments proposed; and when\r\nthrough the whole, he puts the question whether it shall be read a third\r\ntime? if it come from the other House; or, if originating with\r\nthemselves, whether it shall be engrossed and read a third time? The\r\nSpeaker reads sitting, but rises to put questions. The clerk stands\r\nwhile he reads.\r\n\r\n[[40]But the Senate of the United States is so much in the habit of\r\nmaking many and material amendments at the third reading, that it has\r\nbecome the practice not to engross a bill till it has passed--an\r\nirregular and dangerous practice, because in this way the paper which\r\npasses the Senate is not that which goes to the other House, and that\r\nwhich goes to the other House as the act of the Senate has never been\r\nseen in Senate. In reducing numerous, difficult, and illegible\r\namendments into the text, the Secretary may with the most innocent\r\nintentions, commit errors which can never again be corrected.]\r\n\r\nThe bill being now as perfect as its friends can make it, this is the\r\nproper stage for those fundamentally opposed to make their first attack.\r\nAll attempts at earlier periods are with disjointed efforts, because\r\nmany who do not expect to be in favor of the bill ultimately are willing\r\nto let it go on to its perfect state, to take time to examine it\r\nthemselves and to hear what can be said for it, knowing that after all,\r\nthey will have sufficient opportunities of giving it their veto. Its\r\nlast two stages, therefore, are reserved for this--that is to say, on\r\nthe question whether it shall be engrossed and read a third time, and\r\nlastly, whether it shall pass? The first of these is usually the most\r\ninteresting contest, because then the whole subject is new and engaging;\r\nand the minds of the members having not yet been declared by any trying\r\nvote, the issue is the more doubtful. In this stage, therefore, is the\r\nmain trial of strength between its friends and opponents, and it\r\nbehooves every one to make up his mind decisively for this question, or\r\nhe loses the main battle; and accident and management may, and often do,\r\nprevent a successful rallying on the next and last question, whether it\r\nshall pass.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill is engrossed, the title is to be endorsed on the back and\r\nnot within the bill. _Hakew._, 250.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXII.\r\n\r\nREADING PAPERS.\r\n\r\nWhere papers are laid before the House or referred to a committee, every\r\nmember has a right to have them once read at the table before he can be\r\ncompelled to vote on them; but it is a great though common error to\r\nsuppose that he has a right _toties quoties_, to have acts, journals,\r\naccounts, or papers on the table, read independently of the will of the\r\nHouse. The delay and interruption which this might be made to produce,\r\nevince the impossibility of the existence of such a right. There is,\r\nindeed, so manifest a propriety of permitting every member to have as\r\nmuch information as possible on every question on which he is to vote,\r\nthat when he desires the reading, if it be seen that it is really for\r\ninformation and not for delay, the Speaker directs it to be read without\r\nputting a question, if no one objects; but if objected to, a question\r\nmust be put. 2 _Hats._, 117, 118.\r\n\r\nIt is equally an error to suppose that any member has a right, without a\r\nquestion put, to lay a book or paper on the table, or have it read, on\r\nsuggesting that it contains matter infringing on the privileges of the\r\nHouse. _Ib._\r\n\r\nFor the same reason a member has not a right to read a paper in his\r\nplace, if it be objected to, without leave of the House. But this rigor\r\nis never exercised but where there is an intentional or gross abuse of\r\nthe time and patience of the House.\r\n\r\nA member has not a right even to read his own speech, committed to\r\nwriting, without leave. This also is to prevent an abuse of time, and\r\ntherefore is not refused but where that is intended. 2 _Grey_, 226.\r\n\r\nA report of a committee of the Senate on a bill from the House of\r\nRepresentatives being under consideration, on motion that the report of\r\nthe committee of the House of Representatives on the same bill be read\r\nin the Senate, it passed in the negative. _Feb. 28, 1793._\r\n\r\nFormerly when papers were referred to a committee, they used to be first\r\nread; but of late only the titles, unless a number insist that they\r\nshall be read, and then nobody can oppose it. 2 _Hats._, 117.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIII.\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGED QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n[[41] While a question is before the Senate, no motion shall be\r\nreceived, unless for an amendment, for the previous question, or for\r\npostponing the main question, or to commit it, or to adjourn. _Rule 8._]\r\n\r\nIt is no possession of a bill unless it be delivered to the Clerk to be\r\nread, or the Speaker reads the title. _Lex. Parl._, 273; _Elsynge’s\r\nMem._, 85; _Ord. House of Commons_, 64.\r\n\r\nIt is a general rule that the question first moved and seconded shall be\r\nfirst put. _Scob._, 28, 22; 2 _Hats._, 81. But this rule gives way to\r\nwhat may be called privileged questions; and the privileged questions\r\nare of different grades among themselves.\r\n\r\nA motion to adjourn simply takes place of all others, for otherwise the\r\nHouse might be kept sitting against its will, and indefinitely. Yet this\r\nmotion cannot be received after another question is actually put, and\r\nwhile the House is engaged in voting.\r\n\r\nOrders of the day take place of all other questions, except for\r\nadjournment--that is to say, the question which is the subject of an\r\norder is made a privileged one, _pro hac vice_. The order is a repeal of\r\nthe general rule as to this special case. When any member moves,\r\ntherefore, for the Order of the Day to be read, no further debate is\r\npermitted on the question which was before the House; for if the debate\r\nmight proceed, it might continue through the day and defeat the order.\r\nThis motion, to entitle it to precedence, must be for the orders\r\ngenerally, and not for any particular one; and if it be carried on the\r\nquestion, “Whether the House will now proceed to the orders of the day?”\r\nthey must be read and proceeded on in the course in which they stand (_2\r\nHats._, 83), for priority of order gives priority of right, which cannot\r\nbe taken away but by another special order.\r\n\r\nAfter these there are other privileged questions, which will require\r\nconsiderable explanation.\r\n\r\nIt is proper that every parliamentary assembly should have certain forms\r\nof questions, so adapted as to enable them fitly to dispose of every\r\nproposition which can be made to them. Such are: 1. The previous\r\nquestion. 2. To postpone indefinitely. 3. To adjourn a question to a\r\ndefinite day. 4. To lie on the table. 5. To commit. 6. To amend. The\r\nproper occasion for each of these questions should be understood.\r\n\r\n1. When a proposition is moved which it is useless or inexpedient now to\r\nexpress or discuss, the previous question has been introduced for\r\nsuppressing for that time the motion and its discussion. 3 _Hats._, 188,\r\n189.\r\n\r\n2. But as the previous question gets rid of it only for that day, and\r\nthe same proposition may recur the next day, if they wish to suppress it\r\nfor the whole of that session, they postpone it indefinitely. 3 _Hats._,\r\n183. This quashes the proposition for that session, as an indefinite\r\nadjournment is a dissolution, or the continuance of a suit sine die is a\r\ndiscontinuance of it.\r\n\r\n3. When a motion is made which it will be proper to act on, but\r\ninformation is wanted, or something more pressing claims the present\r\ntime, the question or debate is adjourned to such day within the session\r\nas will answer the views of the House. 2 _Hats._, 81. And those who have\r\nspoken before may not speak again when the adjourned debate is resumed.\r\n2 _Hats._, 73. Sometimes, however, this has been abusedly used by\r\nadjourning it to a day beyond the session, to get rid of it altogether,\r\nas would be done by an indefinite postponement.\r\n\r\n4. When the House has something else which claims its present attention,\r\nbut would be willing to reserve in their power to take up a proposition\r\nwhenever it shall suit them, they order it to lie on the table. It may\r\nthen be called for at any time.\r\n\r\n5. If the proposition will want more amendment and digestion than the\r\nformalities of the House will conveniently admit, they refer it to a\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n6. But if the proposition be well digested, and may need but few and\r\nsimple amendments, and especially if these be of leading consequence,\r\nthey then proceed to consider and amend it themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Senate, in their practice, vary from this regular gradation of\r\nforms. Their practice comparatively with that of Parliament stands thus:\r\n\r\n  FOR THE PARLIAMENT:             THE SENATE USES:\r\n\r\n  Postponement indefinite,        Postponement to a day beyond the session,\r\n  Adjournment,                    Postponement to a day within the session,\r\n  Lying on the table.           { Postponement indefinite,\r\n                                { Lying on the table.\r\n\r\nIn their eighth rule, therefore, which declares that while the question\r\nis before the Senate no motion shall be received, unless it be for the\r\nprevious question, or to postpone, commit, or amend the main question,\r\nthe term postponement must be understood according to their broad use of\r\nit and not in the parliamentary sense. Their rule then establishes as\r\nprivileged questions, the previous questions, postponement, commitment\r\nand amendment.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, Have these questions any privileges among\r\nthemselves? or are they so equal that the common principle of the “first\r\nmoved first put” takes place among them? This will need explanation.\r\nTheir competitions may be as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. Previous question and postpone   } In the first, second and\r\n                           commit     } third classes, and the\r\n                           amend      } first member of the\r\n                                        fourth class the rule\r\n  2. Postpone and previous question   } “first moved first put”\r\n                           commit     } takes place.\r\n                           amend      }\r\n\r\n  3. Commit and previous question     }\r\n                         postpone     }\r\n                         amend        }\r\n\r\n  4. Amend and previous question      }\r\n                         postpone     }\r\n                         commit       }\r\n\r\nIn the first class, where the previous question is first moved, the\r\neffect is peculiar; for it not only prevents the after motion to\r\npostpone or commit from being put to question before it, but also from\r\nbeing put after it; for if the previous question be decided\r\naffirmatively, to wit, that the main question shall _now_ be put, it\r\nwould of course be against the decision to postpone or commit; and if it\r\nbe decided negatively, to wit, that the main question shall not now be\r\nput, this puts the House out of possession of the main question, and\r\nconsequently there is nothing before them to postpone or commit. So that\r\nneither voting for nor against the previous question will enable the\r\nadvocates for postponing or committing to get at their object. Whether\r\nit may be amended shall be examined hereafter.\r\n\r\nSecond class. If postponement be decided affirmatively, the proposition\r\nis removed from before the House, and consequently there is no ground\r\nfor the previous question, commitment, or amendment; but if decided\r\nnegatively (that it shall not be postponed), the main question may then\r\nbe suppressed by the previous question, or may be committed or amended.\r\n\r\nThe third class is subject to the same observations as the second.\r\n\r\nThe fourth class. Amendment of the main question first moved, and\r\nafterwards the previous question, the question of amendment shall be\r\nfirst put.\r\n\r\nAmendment and postponement competing, postponement is first put, as the\r\nequivalent proposition to adjourn the main question would be in\r\nParliament. The reason is, that the question for amendment is not\r\nsuppressed by postponing or adjourning the main question, but remains\r\nbefore the House whenever the main question is resumed; and it might be\r\nthat the occasion for other urgent business might go by, and be lost by\r\nlength of debate on the amendment if the House had it not in their power\r\nto postpone the whole subject.\r\n\r\nAmendment and commitment. The question for committing though last moved,\r\nshall be first put; because, in truth, it facilitates and befriends the\r\nmotion to amend. _Scobell_ is express: “On motion to amend a bill, any\r\none may notwithstanding move to commit it, and the question for\r\ncommitment shall be first put.” _Scob._, 46.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto considered the case of two or more of the privileged\r\nquestions contending for privilege between themselves, when both are\r\nmoved on the original or main question; but now let us suppose one of\r\nthem to be moved not on the original primary question, but on the\r\nsecondary one, _e. g._\r\n\r\nSuppose a motion to postpone, commit or amend the main question, and\r\nthat it be moved to suppress that motion by putting a previous question\r\non it. This is not allowed, because it would embarrass questions too\r\nmuch to allow them to be piled on one another several stories high; and\r\nthe same result may be had in a more simple way, by deciding against the\r\npostponement, commitment or amendment. 2 _Hats._, 81, 2, 3, 4.\r\n\r\nSuppose a motion for the previous question, or commitment, or amendment\r\nof the main question, and that it be then moved to postpone the motion\r\nfor the previous question, or for commitment or amendment of the main\r\nquestion. 1. It would be absurd to postpone the previous question,\r\ncommitment or amendment alone, and thus separate the appendage from its\r\nprincipal; yet it must be postponed separately from its original, if at\r\nall, because the eighth rule of Senate says that “When a main question\r\nis before the house, no motion shall be received but to commit, amend or\r\npre-question the original question,” which is the parliamentary doctrine\r\nalso; therefore, the motion to postpone the secondary motion for the\r\nprevious question, or for committing or amending, cannot be received. 2.\r\nThis is a piling of questions one on another; which, to avoid\r\nembarrassment, is not allowed. 3. The same result may be had more simply\r\nby voting against the previous question, commitment or amendment.\r\n\r\nSuppose a commitment moved of a motion for the previous question, or to\r\npostpone or amend. The first, second and third reasons before stated,\r\nall hold good against this.\r\n\r\nSuppose an amendment moved to a motion for the previous question.\r\nAnswer: the previous question cannot be amended. Parliamentary usage, as\r\nwell as the ninth rule of the Senate, has fixed its form to be, “Shall\r\nthe main question be now put?”--_i. e._, at this instant; and as the\r\npresent instant is but one, it can admit of no modification. To change\r\nit to to-morrow, or any other moment, is without example and without\r\nutility. But suppose a motion to amend a motion for postponement, as to\r\none day instead of another, or to a special instead of an indefinite\r\ntime. The useful character of amendment gives it a privilege of\r\nattaching itself to a secondary and privileged motion: that is, we may\r\namend a postponement of a main question. So, we may amend a commitment\r\nof a main question, as by adding, for example, “with instructions to\r\ninquire,” etc. In like manner, if an amendment be moved to an amendment,\r\nit is admitted; but it would not be admitted in another degree, to-wit:\r\nto amend an amendment to an amendment of a main question. This would\r\nlead to too much embarrassment. The line must be drawn somewhere, and\r\nusage has drawn it after the amendment to the amendment. The same result\r\nmust be sought by deciding against the amendment to the amendment, and\r\nthen moving it again as it wished to be amended. In this form it becomes\r\nonly an amendment to an amendment.\r\n\r\n[When motions are made for reference of the same subject to a select\r\ncommittee and to a standing committee, the question on reference to the\r\nstanding committee shall be first put. _Rule 36._]\r\n\r\n[In filling a blank with a sum, the largest sum shall be first put to\r\nthe question, by the thirteenth rule of the Senate,[42]] contrary to the\r\nrule of Parliament, which privileges the smallest sum and longest time.\r\n5 _Grey_, 179; 2 _Hats._, 8, 83; 3 _Hats._, 132, 133. And this is\r\nconsidered to be not in the form of an amendment to the question, but as\r\nalternative or successive originals. In all cases of time or number, we\r\nmust consider whether the larger comprehends the lesser, as in a\r\nquestion to what day a postponement shall be, the number of a committee,\r\namount of a fine, term of an imprisonment, term of irredeemability of a\r\nloan, or the _terminus in quem_ in any other case; then the question\r\nmust begin _a maximo_. Or whether the lesser includes the greater, as in\r\nquestions on the limitation of the rate of interest, on what day the\r\nsession shall be closed by adjournment, on what day the next shall\r\ncommence when an act shall commence, or the _terminus a quo_ in any\r\nother case where the question must begin _a minimo_; the object being\r\nnot to begin at that extreme which, and more, being within every man’s\r\nwish, no one could negative it, and yet, if he should vote in the\r\naffirmative, every question for more would be precluded; but at that\r\nextreme which would unite few, and then to advance or recede till you\r\nget a number which will unite a bare majority. 3 _Grey_, 376, 384, 385.\r\n“The fair question in this case is not that to which, and more, all will\r\nagree, whether there shall be addition to the question.” _Grey_, 355.\r\n\r\nAnother exception to the rule of priority is when a motion has been made\r\nto strike out or agree to a paragraph. Motions to amend it are to be put\r\nto the question before a vote is taken on striking out or agreeing to\r\nthe whole paragraph.\r\n\r\nBut there are several questions which, being incidental to every one,\r\nwill take place of every one, privileged or not, to-wit: a question of\r\norder arising out of any other question must be decided before that\r\nquestion. 2 _Hats._, 88.\r\n\r\nA matter of privilege arising out of any question, or from a quarrel\r\nbetween two members or any other cause, supercedes the consideration of\r\nthe original question, and must be first disposed of. 2 _Hats._, 88.\r\n\r\nReading papers relative to the question before the House. This question\r\nmust be put before the principal one. 2 _Hats._, 88.\r\n\r\nLeave asked to withdraw a motion. The rule of Parliament being that a\r\nmotion made and seconded is in the possession of the House, and cannot\r\nbe withdrawn without leave, the very terms of the rule imply that leave\r\nmay be given, and, consequently, may be asked and put to the question.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE PREVIOUS QUESTION.\r\n\r\nWhen any question is before the House, any member may move a previous\r\nquestion. “Whether that question (called the main question) shall now be\r\nput?” If it pass in the affirmative, then the main question is to be put\r\nimmediately, and no man may speak anything further to it, either to add\r\nor alter. _Memor. in Hakew._, 28; 4 _Grey_, 27.\r\n\r\nThe previous question being moved and seconded, the question from the\r\nchair shall be, “Shall the main question be now put?” and if the nays\r\nprevail, the main question shall not then be put.\r\n\r\nThis kind of question is understood by Mr. Hatsell to have been\r\nintroduced in 1604. 1 _Hats._, 80. Sir Henry Vane introduced it. _2\r\nGrey_, 113, 114; 3 _Grey_, 384. When the question was put in this form,\r\n“Shall the main question be put?” a determination in the negative\r\nsuppressed the main question during the session; but since the words,\r\n“now put” are used, they exclude it for the present only; formerly,\r\nindeed, only till the present debate was over (4 _Grey_, 43), but now\r\nfor that day and no longer. 2 _Grey_, 113, 114.\r\n\r\nBefore the question “Whether the main question shall now be put?” any\r\nperson might formerly have spoken to the main question, because\r\notherwise he would be precluded from speaking to it at all. _Mem. in\r\nHakew._, 28.\r\n\r\nThe proper occasion for the previous question, is when a question is\r\nbrought forward of a delicate nature as to high personages, etc., or the\r\ndiscussion of which may call forth observations which might be of\r\ninjurious consequences. Then the previous question is proposed; and in\r\nthe modern usage, the discussion of the main question is suspended, and\r\nthe debate confined to the previous question. The use of it has been\r\nextended abusively to other cases; but in these it has been an\r\nembarrassing procedure; its uses would be as well answered by other more\r\nsimple parliamentary forms, and therefore it should not be favored, but\r\nrestricted within as narrow limits as possible.\r\n\r\nWhether a main question may be amended after the previous question on it\r\nhas been moved and seconded? 2 _Hats._, 88, says, if the previous\r\nquestion has been moved and seconded, and also proposed from the chair\r\n(by which he means stated by the Speaker for debate), it has been\r\ndoubted whether an amendment can be admitted to the main question. He\r\nthinks it may, after the previous question is moved and seconded; but\r\nnot after it has been proposed from the chair. In this case he thinks\r\nthe friends to the amendment must vote that the main question be not now\r\nput; and then move their amended question, which being made new by the\r\namendment, is no longer the same which has just been suppressed, and\r\ntherefore may be proposed as a new one. But this proceeding certainly\r\nendangers the main question, by dividing its friends, some of whom may\r\nchoose it unamended, rather than lose it altogether; while others of\r\nthem may vote, as Hatsell advises, that the main question be not now put\r\nwith a view to move it again in an amended form. The enemies of the main\r\nquestion, by this manœuvre to the previous question, get the enemies to\r\nthe amendment added to them on the first vote, and throw the friends of\r\nthe main question under the embarrassment of rallying again as they can.\r\nTo support his opinion, too, he makes the deciding circumstances,\r\nwhether an amendment may or may not be made, to be, that the previous\r\nquestion has been proposed from the Chair. But, as the rule is that the\r\nHouse is in possession of a question as soon as it is moved and\r\nseconded, it cannot be more than possessed of it by its being also\r\nproposed from the Chair. It maybe said, indeed, that the object of the\r\nprevious question being to get rid of a question, which it is not\r\nexpedient should be discussed, this object may be defeated by moving to\r\namend, and, in the discussion of that motion, involving the subject of\r\nthe main question. But so may the object of the previous question be\r\ndefeated, by moving the amended question as Mr. Hatsell proposes after\r\nthe decision against putting the original question. He acknowledges,\r\ntoo, that the practice has been to admit previous amendments, and only\r\ncites a few late instances to the contrary. On the whole, I should think\r\nit best to decide it ab inconvenienti, to wit: which is most\r\ninconvenient, to put it in the power of one side of the House to defeat\r\na proposition by hastily moving the previous question, and thus forcing\r\nthe main question to be put unamended; or to put it in the power of the\r\nother side to force on, incidentally at least, a discussion which would\r\nbe better avoided? Perhaps the last is the least inconvenience; inasmuch\r\nas the Speaker, by confining the discussion rigorously to the amendment\r\nonly, may prevent their going into the main question, and inasmuch also\r\nas so great a proportion of the cases in which the previous question is\r\ncalled for, are fair and proper subjects for public discussion, and\r\nought not to be obstructed by a formality introduced for questions of a\r\npeculiar character.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXV.\r\n\r\nAMENDMENTS.\r\n\r\nOn an amendment being moved, a member who has spoken to the main\r\nquestion may speak again to the amendment. _Scob._, 23.\r\n\r\nIf an amendment be proposed inconsistent with one already agreed to, it\r\nis a fit ground for its rejection by the House, but not within the\r\ncompetence of the Speaker to suppress as if it were against order; for\r\nwere he permitted to draw questions of consistence within the vortex of\r\norder, he might usurp a negative on important modifications, and\r\nsuppress, instead of subserving the legislative will.\r\n\r\nAmendments may be made so as totally to alter the nature of the\r\nproposition; and it is a way of getting rid of a proposition, by making\r\nit bear a sense different from what it was intended by the movers, so\r\nthat they vote against it themselves. 2 _Hats._, 79, 4, 82, 84. A new\r\nbill may be engrafted by way of amendment, on the words, “Be it\r\nenacted,” etc. 1 _Grey_, 190, 192.\r\n\r\nIf it be proposed to amend by leaving out certain words, it may be\r\nmoved, as an amendment to this amendment, to leave out part of the words\r\nof the amendment, which is equivalent to leaving them in the bill _2\r\nHats._, 80, 9. The parliamentary question is, always, whether the words\r\nshall stand part of the bill.\r\n\r\nWhen it is proposed to amend by inserting a paragraph, or part of one,\r\nthe friends of the paragraph may make it as perfect as they can by\r\namendments before the question is put for inserting it. If it be\r\nreceived, it cannot be amended afterwards, in the same stage, because\r\nthe House has, on a vote, agreed to it in that form. In like manner, if\r\nit is proposed to amend by striking out a paragraph, the friends of the\r\nparagraph are first to make it as perfect as they can by amendments,\r\nbefore the question is put for striking it out. If on the question it be\r\nretained, it cannot be amended afterwards, because a vote against\r\nstriking out is equivalent to a vote agreeing to it in that form.\r\n\r\nWhen it is moved to amend by striking out certain words and inserting\r\nothers, the manner of stating the question is first to read the whole\r\npassage to be amended as it stands at present, then the words proposed\r\nto be struck out, next those to be inserted, and lastly the whole\r\npassage as it will be when amended. And the question, if desired, is\r\nthen to be divided, and put first on striking out. If carried, it is\r\nnext on inserting the words proposed. If that be lost, it may be moved\r\nto insert others. 2 _Hats._, 80, 7.\r\n\r\nA motion is made to amend by striking out certain words and inserting\r\nothers in their place, which is negatived. Then it is moved to strike\r\nout the same words, and to insert others, of a tenor entirely different\r\nfrom those first proposed. It is negatived. Then it is moved to strike\r\nout the same words and insert nothing, which is agreed to. All this is\r\nadmissible, because to strike out and insert A, is one proposition. To\r\nstrike out and insert B, is a different proposition. And to strike out\r\nand insert nothing is still different. And the rejection of one\r\nproposition does not preclude the offering a different one. Nor would it\r\nchange the case were the first motion divided by putting the question\r\nfirst on striking out, and that negatived; for, as putting the whole\r\nmotion to the question at once would not have precluded, the putting the\r\nhalf of it cannot do it.[43]\r\n\r\nBut if it had been carried affirmatively to strike out the words and to\r\ninsert A, it could not afterwards be permitted to strike out A and\r\ninsert B. The mover of B should have notified, while the insertion of A\r\nwas under debate, that he would move to insert B; in which case those\r\nwho preferred it would join in rejecting A.\r\n\r\nAfter A is inserted, however, it may be moved to strike out a portion of\r\nthe original paragraph, comprehending A, provided the coherence to be\r\nstruck out be so substantial as to make this effectively a different\r\nproposition; for then it is resolved into the common case of striking\r\nout a paragraph after amending it. Nor does anything forbid a new\r\ninsertion, instead of A and its coherence.\r\n\r\nIn Senate, January 25, 1798, a motion to postpone until the second\r\nTuesday in February some amendments proposed to the Constitution; the\r\nwords “until the second Tuesday in February” were struck out by way of\r\namendment. Then it was moved to add, “until the first day of June.”\r\nObjected that it was not in order, as the question should be first put\r\non the longest time; therefore, after a shorter time decided against, a\r\nlonger cannot be put to question. It was answered that this rule takes\r\nplace only in filling blanks for time. But when a specific time stands\r\npart of motion, that may be struck out as well as any other part of a\r\nmotion; and when struck out, a motion may be received to insert any\r\nother. In fact, it is not until they are struck out, and a blank for the\r\ntime thereby produced, that the rule can begin to operate, by receiving\r\nall the propositions for different times, and putting the question\r\nsuccessively on the longest. Otherwise it would be in the power of the\r\nmover, by inserting originally a short time, to preclude the possibility\r\nof a longer, for till the short time is struck out, you cannot insert a\r\nlonger; and if, after it is struck out, you cannot do it, then it cannot\r\nbe done at all. Suppose the first motion had been made to amend by\r\nstriking out “the second Tuesday in February,” and inserting instead\r\nthereof “the first of June;” it would have been regular, then, to divide\r\nthe question, by proposing the first question to strike out and then\r\nthat to insert. Now this is precisely the effect of the present\r\nproceeding; only, instead of one motion and two questions, there are two\r\nmotions and two questions to effect it--the motion being divided as well\r\nas the question.\r\n\r\nWhen the matter contained in two bills might better be put into one, the\r\nmanner is to reject the one, and incorporate its matter into another\r\nbill by way of amendment. So if the matter of one bill would be better\r\ndistributed into two, any part may be struck out by way of amendment,\r\nand put into a new bill. If a section is to be transposed, a question\r\nmust be put on striking it out where it stands, and another for\r\ninserting it in the place desired.\r\n\r\nA bill passed by the one house with blanks. These may be filled up by\r\nthe other by way of amendments, returned to the first as such, and\r\npassed. 3 _Hats._, 83.\r\n\r\nThe number prefixed to the section of a bill, being merely a marginal\r\nindication, and no part of the text of the bill, the clerk regulates\r\nthat--the House or committee is only to amend the text.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVI.\r\n\r\nDIVISION OF THE QUESTION.\r\n\r\nIf a question contain more parts than one, it may be divided into two or\r\nmore questions. _Mem. in Hakew._, 39. But not as the right of an\r\nindividual member, but with the consent of the House. For who is to\r\ndecide whether a question is complicated or not?--where it is\r\ncomplicated?--into how many propositions it may be divided? The fact is,\r\nthat the only mode of separating a complicated question is by moving\r\namendments to it; and these must be decided by the House, on a question,\r\nunless the House orders it to be divided; as, on the question, December\r\n2, 1640, making void the election of the knights for Worcester, on a\r\nmotion it was resolved to make two questions of it, to-wit: one on each\r\nknight. 2 _Hats._, 85, 86. So, wherever there are several names in\r\nquestion, they may be divided and put one by one. 9 _Grey_, 444. So,\r\n1729, April 17, on an objection that a question was complicated, it was\r\nseparated by amendment. 2 _Hats._, 79.\r\n\r\nThe soundness of these observations will be evident from the\r\nembarrassments produced by the 12th rule of the Senate, which says, “If\r\nthe question in debate contain several points, any member may have the\r\nsame divided.”\r\n\r\n1798, May 30, the alien bill in quasi-committee. To a section and\r\nproviso in the original had been added two new provisos by way of\r\namendment. On a motion to strike out the section as amended, the\r\nquestion was desired to be divided. To do this it must be put first on\r\nstriking out either the former proviso or some distinct member of the\r\nsection. But when nothing remains but the last member or the section and\r\nthe proviso, they cannot be divided so as to put the last member to\r\nquestion by itself; for the provisos might then be left standing alone\r\nas exceptions to a rule when the rule is taken away; or the new provisos\r\nmight be left to a second question, after having been decided on once\r\nbefore at the same reading, which is contrary to rule. But the question\r\nmust be on striking out the last member of the section as amended. This\r\nsweeps away the exceptions with the rule, and relieves from\r\ninconsistence. A question to be divisible, must comprehend points so\r\ndistinct and entire that one of them being taken away the other may\r\nstand entire. But a proviso or exception without an enacting clause does\r\nnot contain an entire point or proposition.\r\n\r\nMay 31. The same bill being before the Senate. There was a proviso that\r\nthe bill should not extend, 1, To any foreign minister; nor, 2, To any\r\nperson to whom the President should give a passport; nor, 3, To any\r\nalien merchant conforming himself to such regulations as the President\r\nshall prescribe; and a division of the question into its simplest\r\nelements was called for. It was divided into four parts, the fourth\r\ntaking in the words, “conforming himself,” etc. It was objected that the\r\nwords, “any alien merchant,” could not be separated from their modifying\r\nwords, “conforming,” etc., because these words if left by themselves\r\ncontain no substantive idea--will make no sense. But admitting that the\r\ndivisions of a paragraph into separate questions must be so made that\r\neach part may stand by itself, yet the House having, on the question,\r\nretained the two first divisions, the words, “any alien merchant,” may\r\nbe struck out, and their modifying words will then attach themselves to\r\nthe preceding description of persons, and become a modification of that\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nWhen a question is divided, after the question on the first member, the\r\nsecond is open to debate and amendment; because it is a known rule that\r\na person may rise and speak at any time before the question has been\r\ncompletely decided, by putting the negative as well as the affirmative\r\nside. But the question is not completely put when the vote has been\r\ntaken on the first member only. One-half of the question, both\r\naffirmative and negative, remains still to be put. See _Execut. Jour.,\r\nJune 25, 1795_. The same decision by President Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVII.\r\n\r\nCO-EXISTING QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked whether the House can be in possession of two motions or\r\npropositions at the same time, so that one of them being decided, the\r\nother goes to question without being moved anew? The answer must be\r\nspecial. When a question is interrupted by a vote of adjournment, it is\r\nthereby removed from before the House, and does not stand ipso facto\r\nbefore them at their next meeting, but must come forward in the usual\r\nway. So, when it is interrupted by the order of the day. Such other\r\nprivileged questions also as dispose of the main question (_e. g._ the\r\nprevious question, postponement, or commitment), remove it from before\r\nthe House. But it is only suspended by a motion to amend, to withdraw,\r\nto read papers, or by a question of order or privilege, and stands again\r\nbefore the House when these are decided. None but the class of\r\nprivileged questions can be brought forward while there is another\r\nquestion before the House, the rule being that when a motion has been\r\nmade and seconded, no other can be received, except it be a privileged\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nEQUIVALENT.\r\n\r\nIf, on a question for rejection, a bill be retained, it passes of course\r\nto its next reading. _Hakew._, 141; _Scob._, 42. And a question for a\r\nsecond reading determined negatively, is a rejection without further\r\nquestion. 4 _Grey_, 149. And see _Elsynge’s Mem._, 42, in what cases\r\nquestions are to be taken for rejection.\r\n\r\nWhere questions are perfectly equivalent, so that the negative of the\r\none amounts to the affirmative of the other, and leaves no other\r\nalternative, the decision of the one concludes necessarily the other. _4\r\nGrey_, 157. Thus the negative of striking out amounts to the affirmative\r\nof agreeing; and therefore to put a question on agreeing after that on\r\nstriking out, would be to put the same question in effect twice over.\r\nNot so in questions of amendments between the two Houses. A motion to\r\nrecede being negatived, does not amount to a positive vote to insist,\r\nbecause there is another alternative, to wit: to adhere.\r\n\r\nA bill originating in one House is passed by the other with an\r\namendment. A motion in the originating House to agree to the amendment\r\nis negatived. Does there result from this a vote of disagreement, or\r\nmust the question on disagreement be expressly voted? The questions\r\nrespecting amendments from another house are--1st, to agree; 2d, to\r\ndisagree; 3d, recede; 4th, insist; 5th, adhere.\r\n\r\n  1st. To agree.   } Either of these concludes the other\r\n  2d. To disagree. } necessarily, for the positive of either is\r\n                     exactly the equivalent of the negative of\r\n                     the other, and no other alternative remains.\r\n                     On either motion amendments to\r\n                     the amendments may be proposed: _e. g._,\r\n                     if it be moved to disagree, those who are\r\n                     for the amendment have a right to propose\r\n                     amendments, and to make it as perfect\r\n                     as they can, before the question of\r\n                     disagreeing is put.\r\n  3d.

It does not raise so necessary an\r\n                    implication as may authorize the Secretary\r\n                    by inference to enter another vote; for\r\n                    two alternatives still remain, either of\r\n                    which may be adopted by the House.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION.\r\n\r\nThe question is to be first put on the affirmative, and then on the\r\nnegative side.\r\n\r\nAfter the Speaker has put the affirmative part of the question, any\r\nmember who has not spoken before to the question may rise and speak\r\nbefore the negative be put; because it is no full question till the\r\nnegative part be put. _Scob._, 23; 2 _Hats._, 73.\r\n\r\nBut in small matters, and which are, of course, such as receiving\r\npetitions, reports, withdrawing motions, reading papers, etc., the\r\nSpeaker most commonly supposes the consent of the House where no\r\nobjection is expressed, and does not give them the trouble of putting\r\nthe question formally. _Scob._, 22; 2 _Hats._, 87; 5 _Grey_, 129; _9\r\nGrey_, 301.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XL.\r\n\r\nBILLS--THIRD READING.\r\n\r\nTo prevent bills from being passed by surprise, the House by a standing\r\norder, directs that they shall not be put on their passage before a\r\nfixed hour, naming one at which the House is commonly full. _Hakew._,\r\n153.\r\n\r\n[The usage of the Senate is, not to put bills on their passage till\r\nnoon.]\r\n\r\nA bill reported and passed to the third reading cannot on that day be\r\nread the third time and passed; because this would be to pass on two\r\nreadings in the same day.\r\n\r\nAt the third reading the clerk reads the bill and delivers it to the\r\nSpeaker, who states the title, that it is the third time of reading the\r\nbill, and that the question will be whether it shall pass? Formerly, the\r\nSpeaker, or those who prepared a bill, prepared also a breviate or\r\nsummary statement of its contents, which the Speaker read when he\r\ndeclared the state of the bill, at the several readings. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, he read the bill itself, especially on its passage. _Hakew._,\r\n136, 137, 153; Coke, 22, 115. Latterly, instead of this, he, at the\r\nthird reading, states the whole contents of the bill, verbatim, only,\r\ninstead, of reading the formal parts “Be it enacted,” etc., he states\r\nthat “preamble recites so and so--the first section enacts that, etc.;\r\nthe second section enacts,” etc.\r\n\r\n[But in the Senate of the United States both of these formalities are\r\ndispensed with; the breviate presenting but an imperfect view of the\r\nbill, and being capable of being made to present a false one; and the\r\nfull statement being a useless waste of time, immediately after a full\r\nreading by the clerk, and especially as every member has a printed copy\r\nin his hand.]\r\n\r\nA bill on the third reading is not to be committed for the matter or\r\nbody thereof; but to receive some particular clause or proviso, it has\r\nbeen sometimes suffered, but as a thing very unusual. _Hakew._, 126.\r\nThus, _27 El._, 1584, a bill was committed on the third reading, having\r\nbeen formally committed on the second, but it is declared not usual.\r\n_D’Ewes_, 337, _col._ 2; 414, _col._ 2.\r\n\r\nWhen an essential provision has been omitted, rather than erase the bill\r\nand render it suspicious, they add a clause on a separate paper,\r\nengrossed and called a rider, which is read and put to the question\r\nthree times. _Elsynge’s Memorials_, 59; 6 _Grey_, 335; 1 _Blackst._,\r\n183. For examples of riders, see 3 _Hats._, 121, 122, 124, 126. Every\r\none is at liberty to bring in a rider without asking leave. _10 Grey_,\r\n52.\r\n\r\nIt is laid down as a general rule, that amendments proposed at the\r\nsecond reading shall be twice read, and those proposed at the third\r\nreading thrice read; as also all amendments from the other House.\r\n_Town._, _col._ 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.\r\n\r\nIt is with great and almost invincible reluctance that amendments are\r\nadmitted at this reading, which occasion erasures or interlineations.\r\nSometimes a proviso has been cut off from a bill; sometimes erased. _9\r\nGrey_, 513.\r\n\r\nThis is the proper stage for filling up blanks; for if filled up before,\r\nand now altered by erasure, it would be peculiarly unsafe.\r\n\r\nAt this reading the bill is debated afresh, and for the most part is\r\nmore spoken to at this time than on any of the former readings.\r\n_Hakew._, 153.\r\n\r\nThe debate on the question whether it should be read a third time has\r\ndiscovered to its friends and opponents the arguments on which each side\r\nrelies, and which of these appear to have influence with the House; they\r\nhave had time to meet them with new arguments, and to put their old\r\nones into new shapes. The former vote has tried the strength of the\r\nformer opinion, and furnished grounds to estimate the issue; and the\r\nquestion now offered for its passage is the last occasion which is ever\r\nto be offered for carrying or rejecting it.\r\n\r\nWhen the debate is ended, the Speaker, holding the bill in his hand,\r\nputs the question for its passage, by saying, “Gentlemen, all of you who\r\nare of opinion that this bill shall pass, say aye;” and after the answer\r\nof the ayes, “All those of the contrary opinion, say no.” _Hakew._, 154.\r\n\r\nAfter the bill is passed, there can be no further alteration of it in\r\nany point. _Hakew._, 159.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLI.\r\n\r\nDIVISION OF THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe affirmative and negative of the question having been both put and\r\nanswered, the Speaker declares whether the yeas or nays have it by the\r\nsound, if he be himself satisfied, and it stands as the judgment of the\r\nHouse. But if he be not himself satisfied which voice is the greater, or\r\nif before any other member comes into the House, or before any new\r\nmotion is made (for it is too late after that), any member shall rise\r\nand declare himself dissatisfied with the Speaker’s decision, then the\r\nSpeaker is to divide the House. _Scob._, 24; 2 _Hats._, 140.\r\n\r\nWhen the House of Commons is divided, the one party goes forth, and the\r\nother remains in the House. This has made it important which go forth\r\nand which remain; because the latter gain all the indolent, the\r\nindifferent, and inattentive. Their general rule therefore, is, that\r\nthose who give their vote for the preservation of the orders of the\r\nHouse, shall stay in; and those who are for introducing any new matter\r\nor alteration, or proceeding contrary to the established course, are to\r\ngo out. But this rule is subject to many exceptions and modifications.\r\n2 _Hats._, 134; 1 _Rush._, _p._ 3, _fol._ 92; _Scob._, 43, 52; _Co._,\r\n12, 116; _D’Ewes_, 505, _col._ 1; _Mem. in Hakew._, 25, 29, as will\r\nappear by the following statement of who go forth.\r\n\r\n  Petition that it be received[44]                    } Ayes.\r\n    Read                                              }\r\n\r\n    Lie on the table                                  } Noes.\r\n    Rejected after refusal to lie on the table        }\r\n\r\n    Referred to committee for further proceeding        Ayes.\r\n\r\n  Bill, that it be brought in                         }\r\n    Read first or second time                         }\r\n    Engrossed or read a third time                    } Ayes.\r\n    Proceedings on every other stage                  }\r\n    Committed                                         }\r\n\r\n  To committee of the whole                             Noes.\r\n\r\n  To select committee                                   Ayes.\r\n\r\n  Report of bill to lie on table                        Noes.\r\n\r\n  Be now _read_                                       } Ayes.\r\n    Be taken into consideration three months hence    } 30, P.

Then they\r\nplace themselves within the door, two on each side, and count those who\r\nwent forth as they come in, and report the number to the Speaker. _Mem.\r\nin Hakew._, 26.\r\n\r\nA mistake in the report of the tellers may be rectified after the report\r\nmade. 2 _Hats._, 145, note.\r\n\r\n[But in both Houses of Congress all these intricacies are avoided. The\r\nayes first rise, and are counted standing in their places by the\r\nPresident or Speaker. Then they sit, and the noes rise and are counted\r\nin like manner.]\r\n\r\n[In Senate, if they are equally divided, the Vice-President announces\r\nhis opinion, which decides.]\r\n\r\n[The Constitution, however, has directed that “the yeas and nays of the\r\nmembers of either House, on any question shall, at the desire of\r\none-fifth of those present, be entered on the journal.” And again: that\r\nin all cases of reconsidering a bill disapproved by the President, and\r\nreturned with his objections, “the votes of both Houses shall be\r\ndetermined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and\r\nagainst the bill shall be entered on the journals of each House\r\nrespectively.”]\r\n\r\n[By the 16th and 17th rules of the Senate, when the yeas and nays shall\r\nbe called for by one-fifth of the members present, each member called\r\nupon shall, unless for special reasons he be excused by the Senate,\r\ndeclare openly, and without debate, his assent or dissent to the\r\nquestion. In taking the yeas and nays, and upon the call of the House,\r\nthe names of the members shall be taken alphabetically.]\r\n\r\n[When the yeas and nays shall be taken upon any question in pursuance of\r\nthe above rule, no member shall be permitted, under any circumstances\r\nwhatever, to vote after the decision is announced from the chair.]\r\n\r\n[When it is proposed to take the vote by yeas and nays, the President or\r\nSpeaker stales that “the question is whether, _e. g._, the bill shall\r\npass--that it is proposed that the yeas and nays shall be entered on the\r\njournal. Those, therefore, who desire it, will rise.” If he finds and\r\ndeclares that one-fifth have risen, he then states that “those who are\r\nof the opinion that the bill shall pass, are to answer in the\r\naffirmative; those of the contrary opinion in the negative.” The clerk\r\nthen calls over the names alphabetically, notes the yea or nay of each,\r\nand gives the list to the President or Speaker, who declares the result.\r\nIn the Senate, if there be an equal division, the Secretary calls on the\r\nVice-President and notes his affirmative or negative, which becomes the\r\ndecision of the House.]\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons, every member must give his vote the one way or\r\nthe other, (_Scob._, 24.,) as it is not permitted to any one to withdraw\r\nwho is in the House when the question is put, nor is any one to be told\r\nin the division who was not in when the question was put. 2 _Hats._,\r\n140.\r\n\r\nThis last position is always true when the vote is by yeas and nays;\r\nwhere the negative as well as affirmative of the question is stated by\r\nthe President at the same time, and the vote of both sides begins and\r\nproceeds _pari passu_. It is true also when the question is put in the\r\nusual way, if the negative has also been put; but if it has not, the\r\nmember entering, or any other member, may speak, and even propose\r\namendments, by which the debate may be opened again, and the question be\r\ngreatly deferred. And as some who have answered aye may have been\r\nchanged by the new arguments, the affirmative must be put over again.\r\nIf, then, the member entering may, by speaking a few words, occasion a\r\nrepetition of a question, it would be useless to deny it on his simple\r\ncall for it.\r\n\r\nWhile the House is telling, no member may speak or move out of his\r\nplace, for if any mistake be suspected it must be told again. _Mem. in\r\nHakew._, 26; 2 _Hats._, 143.\r\n\r\nIf any difficulty arises in point of order during the division, the\r\nSpeaker is to decide peremptorily, subject to the future censure of the\r\nHouse if irregular. He sometimes permits old experienced members to\r\nassist him with their advice which they do sitting in their seats,\r\ncovered, to avoid the appearance of debate; but this can only be with\r\nthe Speaker’s leave, else the division might last several hours. _2\r\nHats._, 143.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the majority decides; for the _lex majoris partis_ is the\r\nlaw of all councils, elections, etc., where not otherwise expressly\r\nprovided. _Hakew._, 93. But if the House be equally divided, “_semper\r\npresumatur pro negante_;” that is, the former law is not to be changed\r\nbut by a majority. _Towns._, _col._ 134.\r\n\r\n[But in the Senate of the United States, the Vice-President decides when\r\nthe House is divided. _Const., U. S._, I, 3.]\r\n\r\nWhen from counting the House on a division, it appears that there is not\r\na quorum, the matter continues exactly in the State in which it was\r\nbefore the division, and must be resumed at that point on any future\r\nday. 2 _Hats._, 126.\r\n\r\n1606, May 1, on a question whether a member having said yea may\r\nafterwards sit and change his opinion, a precedent was remembered by the\r\nSpeaker, of Mr. Morris, attorney of the wards, in _39 Elis._, who in\r\nlike case changed his opinion. _Mem. Hakew._, 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLII.\r\n\r\nTITLES.\r\n\r\nAfter the bill has passed, and not before, the title may be amended, and\r\nis to be fixed by a question; and the bill is then sent to the other\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLIII.\r\n\r\nRECONSIDERATION.\r\n\r\n[When a question has been once made and carried in the affirmative, or\r\nnegative, it shall be in order for any member of the majority to move\r\nfor the reconsideration thereof; but no motion for the reconsideration\r\nof any vote shall be in order after a bill, resolution, message, report,\r\namendment, or motion upon which the vote was taken shall have gone out\r\nof the possession of the Senate announcing their decision; nor shall any\r\nmotion for reconsideration be in order unless made on the same day on\r\nwhich the vote was taken, or within the two next days of the actual\r\nsession of the Senate thereafter. _Rule 20._]\r\n\r\n[1798, January. A bill on its second reading being amended and on the\r\nquestion whether it shall be read a third time negatived, was restored\r\nby a decision to reconsider that question. Here the votes of negative\r\nand reconsideration, like positive and negative quantities in an\r\nequation, destroy one another, and are as if they were expunged from the\r\njournal. Consequently the bill is open for amendment, just so far as it\r\nwas the moment preceding the question for the third reading; that is to\r\nsay, all parts of the bill are open for amendment except those on which\r\nvotes have been already taken in its present stage. So, also, it may be\r\nrecommitted.]\r\n\r\n[[45]The rule permitting a reconsideration of a question affixing to it\r\nno limitation of time or circumstance, it may be asked whether there is\r\nno limitation? If, after the vote, the paper on which it is passed has\r\nbeen parted with, there can be no reconsideration; as if a vote has been\r\nfor the passage of a bill, and the bill has been sent to the other\r\nHouse. But where the paper remains, as on a bill rejected, when, or\r\nunder what circumstances, does it cease to be susceptible of\r\nreconsideration? This remains to be settled; unless, a sense that the\r\nright of reconsideration is a right to waste the time of the House in\r\nrepeated agitations of the same question, so that it shall never know\r\nwhen a question is done with, should induce them to reform this\r\nanomalous proceeding.]\r\n\r\nIn Parliament, a question once carried cannot be questioned again at the\r\nsame session, but must stand as the judgment of the House. _Towns._\r\n_col._, 67.; _Mem. in Hakew._, 33. And a bill once rejected, another of\r\nthe same substance cannot be brought in again the same session.\r\n_Hakew._, 158; 6 _Grey_, 392. But this does not extend to prevent\r\nputting the same question in different stages of a bill; because every\r\nstage of a bill submits the whole and every part of it to the opinion of\r\nthe House, as open for amendment, either by insertion or omission,\r\nthough the same amendment has been accepted or rejected in a former\r\nstage. So in reports of committees, _e. g._, report of an address, the\r\nsame question is before the House, and open for free discussion.\r\n_Towns._, _col._ 26; 2 _Hats._, 98, 100, 101. So orders of the House, or\r\ninstructions to committee, may be discharged. So a bill, begun in one\r\nhouse, and sent to the other, and there rejected, may be renewed again\r\nin that other, passed and sent back. _Ib._, 92; 3 _Hats._, 161. Or if,\r\ninstead of being rejected, they read it once and lay it aside, or amend\r\nit, and put it off a month, they may order in another to the same\r\neffect, with the same or a different title. _Hakew._, 97, 98.\r\n\r\nDivers expedients are used to correct the effects of this rule; as by\r\npassing an explanatory act, if anything has been omitted or ill\r\nexpressed (3 _Hats._, 278), or an act to enforce, and make more\r\neffectual an act, etc., or to rectify mistakes in act, etc., or a\r\ncommittee on one bill may be instructed to receive a clause to rectify\r\nthe mistakes of another. Thus, June 24, 1685, a clause was inserted in a\r\nbill for rectifying a mistake committed by a clerk in engrossing a bill\r\nof supply. 2 _Hats._, 194, 6. Or the session may be closed for one, two,\r\nthree, or more days, and a new one commenced. But then all matters\r\ndepending must be finished, or they fall, and are to begin de novo. _3\r\nHats._, 94, 98. Or a part of the subject may be taken up by another\r\nbill, or taken up in a different way. 6 _Grey_, 304, 316.\r\n\r\nAnd in cases of the last magnitude, this rule has not been so strictly\r\nand verbally observed as to stop indispensable proceedings altogether,\r\n2 _Hats._, 92, 98. Thus when the address on the preliminaries of peace\r\nin 1782 had been lost by a majority of one, on account of the importance\r\nof the question, and smallness of the majority, the same question in\r\nsubstance, though with some words not in the first, and which might\r\nchange the opinion of some members, was brought on again and carried, as\r\nthe motives for it were thought to outweigh the objection of form. _2\r\nHats._, 99, 100.\r\n\r\nA second bill may be passed to continue an act of the same session, or\r\nto enlarge the time limited for its execution. 2 _Hats._, 95, 98. This\r\nis not in contradiction to the first act.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLIV.\r\n\r\nBILLS SENT TO THE OTHER HOUSE.\r\n\r\n[All bills passed in the Senate shall, before they are sent to the House\r\nof Representatives, be examined by a committee, consisting of three\r\nmembers, whose duty shall be to examine all bills, amendments,\r\nresolutions, or motions, before they go out of the possession of the\r\nSenate, and to make report that they are correctly engrossed; which\r\nreport shall be entered on the journal. _Rule 33._]\r\n\r\nA bill from the other House is sometimes ordered to lie on the table. _2\r\nHats._, 97.\r\n\r\nWhen bills, passed in one House and sent to the other, are grounded on\r\nspecial facts requiring proof, it is usual, either by message or at a\r\nconference, to ask the grounds and evidence; and this evidence, whether\r\narising out of papers, or from the examination of witnesses, is\r\nimmediately communicated. 3 _Hats._, 48.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLV.\r\n\r\nAMENDMENTS BETWEEN THE HOUSES.\r\n\r\nWhen either house, _e. g._, the House of Commons, sends a bill to the\r\nother, the other may pass it with amendments. The regular progression in\r\nthis case is, that the Commons disagree to the amendment; the Lords\r\ninsist on it; the Commons insist on their disagreement; the Lords adhere\r\nto their amendment; the Commons adhere to their disagreement. The term\r\nof insisting may be repeated as often as they choose to keep the\r\nquestion open. But the first adherence by either renders it necessary\r\nfor the other to recede or adhere also; when the matter is usually\r\nsuffered to fall. _10 Grey_, 148. Latterly, however, there are instances\r\nof their having gone to a second adherence. There must be an absolute\r\nconclusion of the subject somewhere, or otherwise transactions between\r\nthe houses would become endless. 3 _Hats._, 268, 270. The term of\r\ninsisting, we are told by Sir John Trevor, was then (1679) newly\r\nintroduced into parliamentary usage by the Lords. 7 _Grey_, 94. It was\r\ncertainly a happy innovation, as it multiplies the opportunities of\r\ntrying modifications which may bring the houses to concurrence. Either\r\nhouse, however, is free to pass over the term of insisting, and to\r\nadhere in the first instance (_10 Grey_, 146); but it is not respectful\r\nto the other. In the ordinary parliamentary course, there are two free\r\nconferences, at least before an adherence. _10 Grey_, 147.\r\n\r\nEither house may recede from its amendment and agree to the bill; or\r\nrecede from their disagreement to the amendment, and agree to the same\r\nabsolutely, or with an amendment; for here the disagreement and receding\r\ndestroy one another, and the subject stands as before the disagreement.\r\n_Elsynge_, 23, 27; 9 _Grey_, 476.\r\n\r\nBut the House cannot recede from, or insist on its own amendment, with\r\nan amendment; for the same reason that it cannot send to the other house\r\nan amendment to its own act after it has passed the act. They may\r\nmodify an amendment from the other house by ingrafting an amendment on\r\nit, because they have never assented to it; but they cannot amend their\r\nown amendment, because they have, on the question passed it in that\r\nform. 9 _Grey_, 363; _10 Grey_, 240. In the Senate, March 29, 1798. Nor\r\nwhere one house has adhered to their amendment, and the other agrees\r\nwith an amendment, can the first house depart from the form which they\r\nhave fixed by an adherence.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a money bill, the Lords’ proposed amendments become, by\r\ndelay, confessedly necessary. The Commons, however, refused them, as\r\ninfringing on their privileges as to money bills; but they offered\r\nthemselves to add to the bill a proviso to the same effect, which had no\r\ncoherence with the Lords’ amendments; and urged that it was an expedient\r\nwarranted by precedent, and not unparliamentary in a case become\r\nimpracticable, and irremediable in any other way. 3 _Hats._, 256, 266,\r\n270, 271. But the Lords refused, and the bill was lost. 1 _Chand._, 288.\r\nA like case, 1 _Chand._, 311. So the Commons resolved that it was\r\nunparliamentary to strike out, at a conference, anything in a bill which\r\nhad been agreed and passed by both Houses. 6 _Grey_, 274; 1 _Chand._,\r\n312.\r\n\r\nA motion to amend an amendment from the other House takes precedence of\r\na motion to agree or disagree.\r\n\r\nA bill originating in one House is passed by the other with an\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nThe originating House agrees to their amendment with an amendment. The\r\nother may agree to their amendment with an amendment, that being only in\r\nthe 2d and not the 3d degree; for, as to the amending House, the first\r\namendment with which they passed the bill is a part of its text; it is\r\nthe only text they have agreed to. The amendment to that text by the\r\noriginating House, therefore, is only in the 1st degree, and the\r\namendment to that again by the amending House is only in the 2d, to wit:\r\nan amendment to an amendment, and so admissible. Just so, when, on a\r\nbill from the originating House, the other, at its second reading makes\r\nan amendment; on the third reading this amendment is become the text of\r\nthe bill, and if an amendment to it be moved, an amendment to that\r\namendment may also be moved, as being only in the 2d degree.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLVI.\r\n\r\nCONFERENCES.\r\n\r\nIt is on the occasion of amendments between the Houses that conferences\r\nare usually asked; but they may be asked in all cases of difference of\r\nopinion between the two Houses on matters depending between them. The\r\nrequest of a conference, however, must always be with the House which is\r\npossessed of the papers. 3 _Hats._, 31; 1 _Grey_, 425.\r\n\r\nConferences may be either simple or free. At a conference simply,\r\nwritten reasons are prepared by the House asking it, and they are read\r\nand delivered, without debate, to the managers of the other House at the\r\nconference; but are not then to be answered. 4 _Grey_, 144. The other\r\nHouse, then, if satisfied, vote the reason satisfactory, or say nothing;\r\nif not satisfied, they resolve them not satisfactory, and ask a\r\nconference on the subject of the last conference, where they read and\r\ndeliver, in like manner, written answers to those reasons. 3 _Grey_,\r\n183. They are meant chiefly to record the jurisdiction of each House to\r\nthe nation at large, and to posterity, and in proof that the miscarriage\r\nof a necessary measure is not imputable to them. 3 _Grey_, 255. At free\r\nconferences the managers discuss, viva voce and freely, and interchange\r\npropositions for such modifications as may be made in a parliamentary\r\nway, and may bring the sense of the two Houses together. And each party\r\nreports in writing to their respective Houses the substance of what is\r\nsaid on both sides, and it is entered in their journals. 9 _Grey_, 220;\r\n3 _Hats._, 280. This report cannot be amended or altered, as that of a\r\ncommittee may be. _Journal of Senate, May 24, 1796._\r\n\r\nA conference may be asked, before the House asking it has come to a\r\nresolution of disagreement, insisting or adhering. 3 _Hats._, 269, 341.\r\nIn which case the papers are not left with the other conferees, but are\r\nbrought back to be the foundation of the vote to be given. And this is\r\nthe most reasonable and respectful proceeding; for, as was urged by the\r\nLords on a particular occasion, “It is held vain, and below the wisdom\r\nof Parliament, to reason or argue against fixed resolutions, and upon\r\nterms of impossibility to persuade.” 3 _Hats._, 226. So the Commons say,\r\n“An adherence is never delivered at a free conference, which implies\r\ndebate.” _10 Grey_, 137. And on another occasion the Lords made it an\r\nobjection that the Commons had asked a free conference after they had\r\nmade resolutions of adhering. It was then affirmed, however, on the part\r\nof the Commons, that nothing was more parliamentary than to proceed with\r\nfree conferences after adhering (3 _Hats._, 269), and we do in fact see\r\ninferences of conferences, or of free conference, asked after the\r\nresolution of disagreeing (3 _Hats._, 251, 253, 260, 286, 291, 316,\r\n349); of insisting (_Ib._ 280, 296, 299, 319, 322, 355); of adhering\r\n(269, 270, 283, 300); and even of a second or final adherence; _3\r\nHats._, 270. And in all cases of conference asked after a vote of\r\ndisagreement, etc., the conferees of the House asking it are to leave\r\nthe papers with the conferees of the other; and in one case where they\r\nrefused to receive them, they were left on the table in the conference\r\nchamber. _Ib._, 317, 323, 354; _10 Grey_, 146.\r\n\r\nAfter a free conference, the usage is to proceed with free conferences,\r\nand not return again to a conference. 3 _Hats._, 270; 9 _Grey_, 229.\r\n\r\nAfter a conference denied, a free conference may be asked. 1 _Grey_, 45.\r\n\r\nWhen a conference is asked, the subject of it must be expressed, or the\r\nconference not agreed to. _Ord. H. Com._, 89; 1 _Grey_, 425; 7 _Grey_,\r\n31. They are sometimes asked to inquire concerning an offence or default\r\nof a member of the other House. 6 _Grey_, 181; 1 _Chand._, 304. Or the\r\nfailure of the other House to present to the King a bill passed by both\r\nHouses. 8 _Grey_, 302. Or on information received, and relating to the\r\nsafety of the nation. _10 Grey_, 177. Or when the methods of Parliament\r\nare thought by the one House to have been departed from by the other, a\r\nconference is asked to come to a right understanding thereon. _10 Grey_,\r\n148. So when an unparliamentary message has been sent, instead of\r\nanswering it, they ask a conference. 3 _Grey_, 155. Formerly an address\r\nor article of impeachment, or a bill with amendments, or a vote of the\r\nHouse, or concurrence in a vote, or a message from the King, were\r\nsometimes communicated by way of conference. 6 _Grey_, 128, 300, 387; _7\r\nGrey_, 80; 8 _Grey_, 210, 255; 1 _Torbuck’s Deb._, 278; _10 Grey_, 293;\r\n1 _Chandler_, 49, 287. But this is not the modern practice. 8 _Grey_,\r\n255.\r\n\r\nA conference has been asked after the first reading of the bill. _1\r\nGrey_, 194. This is a singular instance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLVII.\r\n\r\nMESSAGES.\r\n\r\nMessages between the Houses are to be sent only while both Houses are\r\nsitting. 3 _Hats._, 15. They are received during debate without\r\nadjourning the debate. 3 _Hats._, 22.\r\n\r\n[In Senate the messengers are introduced in any state of business,\r\nexcept, 1. While a question is putting. 2. While the yeas and nays are\r\ncalling. 3. While the ballots are counting. _Rule 47._ The first case is\r\nshort; the second and third are cases where any interruption might\r\noccasion errors difficult to be corrected. So arranged June 15, 1788.]\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, as in Parliament, if the House be in\r\ncommittee when a messenger attends, the Speaker takes the chair to\r\nreceive the message, and then quits it to return into committee, without\r\nany question or interruption. 4 _Grey_, 226.\r\n\r\nMessengers are not saluted by the members, but by the Speaker of the\r\nHouse. 2 _Grey_, 253, 274.\r\n\r\nIf messengers commit an error in delivering their message, they may be\r\nadmitted or called in to correct their message. 4 _Grey_, 41.\r\nAccordingly, March 13, 1800, the Senate having made two amendments to a\r\nbill from the House of Representatives, their Secretary, by mistake,\r\ndelivered one only, which being inadmissible by itself, that house\r\ndisagreed, and notified the Senate of their disagreement. This produced\r\na discovery of the mistake. The Secretary was sent to the House to\r\ncorrect his mistake, the correction was received, and the two amendments\r\nacted on de novo.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the messenger, who has brought bills from the other House,\r\nhas retired, the Speaker holds the bills in his hand, and acquaints the\r\nHouse “that the other house have by their messenger sent certain bills,”\r\nand then reads their titles, and delivers them to the clerk, to be\r\nsafely kept till they shall be called for to be read. _Hakew._, 178.\r\n\r\nIt is not the usage for one House to inform the other by what numbers a\r\nbill has passed. _10 Grey_, 150. Yet they have sometimes recommended a\r\nbill, as of great importance, to the consideration of the House to which\r\nit is sent. 3 _Hats._, 25. Nor when they have rejected a bill from the\r\nother house, do they give notice of it; but it passes sub silentio, to\r\nprevent unbecoming altercations. 1 _Blackst._, 183.\r\n\r\n[But in Congress the rejection is notified by message to the house in\r\nwhich the bill originated.]\r\n\r\nA question is never asked by the one house of the other by way of\r\nmessage, but only at a conference; for this is an interrogatory, not a\r\nmessage. 3 _Grey_, 151, 181.\r\n\r\nWhen a bill is sent by one house to the other, and is neglected, they\r\nmay send a message to remind them of it. 3 _Hats._, 25; 5 _Grey_, 154.\r\nBut if it be mere inattention, it is better to have it done informally,\r\nby communication between the Speakers or members of the two houses.\r\n\r\nWhere the subject of a message is of a nature that it can properly be\r\ncommunicated to both Houses of Parliament, it is expected that this\r\ncommunication should be made to both on the same day. But where a\r\nmessage was accompanied with an original declaration, signed by the\r\nparty to which the message referred, its being sent to one house was not\r\nnoticed by the other, because the declaration, being original, could not\r\npossibly be sent to both houses at the same time. 2 _Hats._, 260, 261,\r\n262.\r\n\r\nThe King having sent original letters to the Commons, afterwards desires\r\nthey may be returned, that he may communicate them to the lords. _1\r\nChandler_, 303.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLVIII.\r\n\r\nASSENT.\r\n\r\nThe house which has received a bill and passed it, may present it for\r\nthe King’s assent, and ought to do it, though they have not by message\r\nnotified to the other their passage of it. Yet the notifying by message\r\nis a form which ought to be observed between the two houses, from\r\nmotives of respect and good understanding. 2 _Hats._, 142. Were the bill\r\nto be withheld from being presented to the King, it would be an\r\ninfringement of the rules of Parliament. _Ib._\r\n\r\n[When a bill has passed both houses of Congress, the house last acting\r\non it notifies its passage to the other, and delivers the bill to the\r\nJoint Committee of Enrollment, who see that it is truly enrolled in\r\nparchment.] When the bill is enrolled, it is not to be written in\r\nparagraphs, but solidly, and all of a piece, that the blanks between the\r\nparagraphs may not give room for forgery. _Grey_, 143. [It is then put\r\ninto the hands of the clerk of the House of Representatives to have it\r\nsigned by the Speaker. The clerk then brings it by way of message to the\r\nSenate to be signed by their President. The Secretary of the Senate\r\nreturns it to the Committee of Enrollment, who present it to the\r\nPresident of the United States. If he approve, he signs, and deposits it\r\namong the rolls in the office of the Secretary of State, and notifies by\r\nmessage the house in which it originated that he has approved and signed\r\nit; of which that house informs the other by message. If the President\r\ndisapproves, he is to return it, with his objections, to that house in\r\nwhich it shall have originated; who are to enter the objections at large\r\non their journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If, after such\r\nreconsideration, two-thirds of that house shall agree to pass the bill,\r\nit shall be sent, together with the President’s objections, to the other\r\nhouse, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered; and if approved by\r\ntwo-thirds of that house, it shall become a law. If any bill shall not\r\nbe returned by the President within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it\r\nshall have been presented to him, the same shall be a law, in like\r\nmanner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress, by its adjournment,\r\nprevent its return; in which case it shall not be a law. _Const. U. S._,\r\nI, 7.]\r\n\r\n[Every order, resolution, or vote, to which the concurrence of the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives may be necessary, (except on a\r\nquestion of adjournment), shall be presented to the President of the\r\nUnited States, and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved\r\nby him; or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of\r\nthe Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and\r\nlimitations prescribed in the case of a bill. _Const. U. S._, I, 7.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XLIX.\r\n\r\nJOURNALS.\r\n\r\n[Each house shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from time to\r\ntime publish the same, excepting such parts as may, in their judgment,\r\nrequire secrecy. _Const._, I, 5.]\r\n\r\n[The proceedings of the Senate, when not acting as in a Committee of the\r\nWhole, shall be entered on the journals as concisely as possible, care\r\nbeing taken to detail a true account of the proceedings. Every vote of\r\nthe Senate shall be entered on the journals, and a brief statement of\r\nthe contents of each petition, memorial, or paper presented to the\r\nSenate, be also inserted on the journal. _Rule 33._]\r\n\r\n[The titles of bills, and such parts thereof only, as shall be affected\r\nby proposed amendments, shall be inserted on the journals. _Rule 32._]\r\n\r\nIf a question is interrupted by a vote to adjourn, or to proceed to the\r\norders of the day, the original question is never printed in the\r\njournal, it never having been a vote, nor introductory to any vote; but\r\nwhen suppressed by the previous question, the first question must be\r\nstated, in order to introduce and make intelligible the second. _2\r\nHats._, 83.\r\n\r\nSo also when a question is postponed, adjourned, or laid on the table,\r\nthe original question, though not yet a vote, must be expressed in the\r\njournals; because it makes part of the vote of postponement, adjourning,\r\nor laying it on the table.\r\n\r\nWhere amendments are made to a question, those amendments are not\r\nprinted in the journals, separated from the question; but only the\r\nquestion as finally agreed to by the House. The rule of entering in the\r\njournals only what the House has agreed to, is founded in great prudence\r\nand good sense; as there may be many questions proposed, which it may be\r\nimproper to publish to the world in the form in which they are made. _2\r\nHats._, 85.\r\n\r\n[In both Houses of Congress, all questions whereon the yeas and nays\r\nare desired by one-fifth of the members present, whether decided\r\naffirmatively or negatively, must be entered on the journals. _Const._,\r\nI, 5.]\r\n\r\nThe first order for printing the votes of the House of Commons was\r\nOctober 30, 1685. 1 _Chandler_, 387.\r\n\r\nSome judges have been of opinion that the journals of the House of\r\nCommons are no records, but only remembrances. But this is not law.\r\n_Hob._, 110, 111; _Lex. Parl._, 114, 115; _Journal H. C., Mar. 17,\r\n1592_; _Hale. Parl._, 105. For the Lords in their house have power of\r\njudicature, the Commons in their house have power of judicature; and\r\nboth houses together have power of judicature; and the Book of the Clerk\r\nof the House of Commons is a record, as is affirmed by act of Parl., _6\r\nH._ 8, _c._ 16; 4 _Inst._, 23, 24; and every member of the House of\r\nCommons hath a judicial place. 4 _Inst._, 15. As records they are open\r\nto every person, and a printed vote of either house is sufficient ground\r\nfor the other to notice it. Either may appoint a committee to inspect\r\nthe journals of the other, and report what has been done by the other in\r\nany particular case. 2 _Hats._, 361; 3 _Hats._, 27-30. Every member has\r\na right to see the journals, and take and publish votes from them. Being\r\na record, every one may see and publish them. 6 _Grey_, 118, 119.\r\n\r\nOn information of a mis-entry or omission of an entry in the journal, a\r\ncommittee may be appointed to examine and rectify it, and report it to\r\nthe House. 2 _Hats._, 194, 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION L.\r\n\r\nADJOURNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe two Houses of Parliament have the sole, separate and independent\r\npower of adjourning each their respective Houses. The King has no\r\nauthority to adjourn them; he can only signify his desire, and it is in\r\nthe wisdom and prudence of either house to comply with his requisition,\r\nor not, as they see fitting. 2 _Hats._, 332; 1 _Blackstone_, 186; _5\r\nGrey_, 122.\r\n\r\n[By the Constitution of the United States a smaller number than a\r\nmajority may adjourn from day to day. I, 5. But “neither House, during\r\nthe session of Congress, shall, without the consent of the other,\r\nadjourn for more than three days, nor to any other place than that in\r\nwhich the two Houses shall be sitting.” I, 5. And in case of\r\ndisagreement between them, with respect to the time of adjournment, the\r\nPresident may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper.\r\n_Const._, II, 3.]\r\n\r\nA motion to adjourn, simply, cannot be amended, as by adding “to a\r\nparticular day;” but must be put simply, “that this House do now\r\nadjourn;” and if carried in the affirmative, it is adjourned to the next\r\nsitting day, unless it has come to a previous resolution, “that at its\r\nrising it will adjourn to a particular day,” and then the House is\r\nadjourned to that day. 2 _Hats._, 82.\r\n\r\nWhere it is convenient that the business of the House be suspended for a\r\nshort time, as for a conference presently to be held, etc., it adjourns\r\nduring pleasure. 2 _Hats._, 305; or for a quarter of an hour. 5 _Grey_,\r\n331.\r\n\r\nIf a question be put for adjournment, it is no adjournment till the\r\nSpeaker pronounces it. 5 _Grey_, 137. And from courtesy and respect, no\r\nmember leaves his place till the Speaker has passed on.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LI.\r\n\r\nA SESSION.\r\n\r\nParliament have three modes of separation, to wit: By adjournment, by\r\nprorogation or dissolution by the King, or by the efflux of the term for\r\nwhich they were elected. Prorogation or dissolution constitutes there\r\nwhat is called a session, provided some act has passed. In this case all\r\nmatters depending before them are discontinued, and at their next\r\nmeeting are to be taken up de novo, if taken up at all. 1 _Blackst._,\r\n186. Adjournment, which is by themselves, is no more than a continuance\r\nof the session from one day to another, or for a fortnight, a month,\r\netc., ad libitum. All matters depending remain in statu quo, and when\r\nthey meet again, be the term ever so distant, are resumed without any\r\nfresh commencement, at the point at which they were left. 1 _Lev._, 165;\r\n_Lex. Parl., c. 2_; 1 _Ro. Rep._, 29; 4 _Inst._, 7, 27, 28; _Hutt._, 61;\r\n1 _Mod._, 252; _Ruffh. Jac. L. Dict. Parliament_; 1 _Blackst._, 186.\r\nTheir whole session is considered in law but as one day, and has\r\nrelation to the first day thereof. _Bro. Abr. Parliament_, 86.\r\n\r\nCommittees may be appointed to sit during a recess by adjournment but\r\nnot by prorogation. 5 _Grey_, 374; 9 _Grey_, 350; 1 _Chandler_, 50.\r\nNeither house can continue any portion of itself in any parliamentary\r\nfunction beyond the end of the session without the consent of the other\r\ntwo branches. When done, it is by a bill constituting them commissioners\r\nfor the particular purpose.\r\n\r\n[Congress separate in two ways only, to-wit: by adjournment, or\r\ndissolution by the efflux of their time. What, then, constitutes a\r\nsession with them? A dissolution closes one session, and the meeting of\r\nthe new Congress begins another. The Constitution authorizes the\r\nPresident, “on extraordinary occasions to convene both houses, or\r\neither of them.” (I, 3) If convened by the President’s proclamation,\r\nthis must begin a new session, and of course determine the preceding one\r\nto have been a session. So if it meets under the clause of the\r\nConstitution, which says, “the Congress shall assemble at least once in\r\nevery year, and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December,\r\nunless they shall by law appoint a different day.” I, 4. This must begin\r\na new session; for even if the last adjournment was to this day, the act\r\nof adjournment is merged in the higher authority of the Constitution,\r\nand the meeting will be under that, and not under their adjournment. So\r\nfar, we have fixed landmarks for determining sessions. In other cases it\r\nis declared by the joint vote authorizing the President of the Senate\r\nand Speaker to close the session on a fixed day, which is usually in the\r\nfollowing form: “Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives,\r\nthat the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives be authorized to close the present session by adjourning\r\ntheir respective houses on the ---- day of ----.”]\r\n\r\nWhen it was said above that all matters depending before Parliament were\r\ndiscontinued by the determination of the session, it was not meant for\r\njudiciary cases, depending before the House of Lords, such as\r\nimpeachments, appeals, and writs of error. These stand continued, of\r\ncourse, to the next session. _Raym._, 120, 381; _Ruffh. Jack. L. D.\r\nParliament_.\r\n\r\n[Impeachments stand, in like manner, continued before the Senate of the\r\nUnited States.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LII.\r\n\r\nTREATIES.\r\n\r\n[The President of the United States has power, by and with the advice\r\nand consent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the\r\nSenators present concur. _Const. U. S._, II, 2.]\r\n\r\n[All confidential communications made by the President of the United\r\nStates to the Senate, shall be by the members thereof kept secret; and\r\nthat all treaties which may hereafter be laid before the Senate, shall\r\nalso be kept secret, until the Senate shall, by their resolution, take\r\noff the injunction of secrecy. _Rule 39._]\r\n\r\nTreaties are legislative acts. A treaty is the law of the land. It\r\ndiffers from other laws only as it must have the consent of a foreign\r\nnation, being but a contract with respect to that nation. In all\r\ncountries, I believe, except England, treaties are made by the\r\nlegislative power; and there also, if they touch the laws of the land,\r\nthey must be approved by Parliament. Ware vs. Hayton, 3 _Dallas’ Rep._,\r\n223. It is acknowledged, for instance, that the King of Great Britain\r\ncannot by a treaty make a citizen of an alien. _Vattel_, _b._ 1, _c._\r\n19, _sec._ 214. An act of Parliament was necessary to validate the\r\nAmerican treaty of 1783. And abundant examples of such acts can be\r\ncited. In the case of the treaty of Utrecht, in 1712, the commercial\r\narticles required the concurrence of Parliament; but a bill brought in\r\nfor that purpose was rejected. France, the other contracting party,\r\nsuffered these articles, in practice, to be not insisted on, and adhered\r\nto the rest of the treaty. 4 _Russel’s Hist. Mod. Europe_, 457; _2\r\nSmollet_, 242, 246.\r\n\r\n[By the Constitution of the United States this department of legislation\r\nis confined to two branches only of the ordinary legislature; the\r\nPresident originating, and the Senate having a negative. To what\r\nsubjects this power extends has not been defined in detail by the\r\nConstitution; nor are we entirely agreed among ourselves. 1. It is\r\nadmitted that it must concern the foreign nation party to the contract,\r\nor it would be a mere nullity, res inter alios acta. 2. By the general\r\npower to make treaties, the Constitution must have intended to\r\ncomprehend only those subjects which are usually regulated by treaty,\r\nand cannot be otherwise regulated. 3. It must have meant to except out\r\nof these rights reserved to the States; for surely the President and\r\nSenate cannot do by treaty what the whole government is interdicted from\r\ndoing in any way. 4. And also to except those subjects of legislation in\r\nwhich it gave a participation to the House of Representatives. This last\r\nexception is denied by some, on the ground that it would leave very\r\nlittle matter for the treaty power to work on. The less the better, say\r\nothers. The Constitution thought it wise to restrain the Executive and\r\nSenate from entangling and embroiling our affairs with those of Europe.\r\nBesides, as the negotiations are carried on by the Executive alone, the\r\nsubjecting to the ratification of the representatives such articles as\r\nare within their participation, is no more inconvenient than to the\r\nSenate. But the ground of this exception is denied as unfounded. For\r\nexamine, _e. g._ the treaty of commerce with France, and it will be\r\nfound that, out of thirty-one articles, there are not more than small\r\nportions of two or three of them which would not still remain as\r\nsubjects of treaties, untouched by these exceptions.]\r\n\r\nTreaties being declared, equally with the laws of the United States, to\r\nbe the supreme law of the land, it is understood that an act of the\r\nlegislature alone can declare them infringed and rescinded. This was\r\naccordingly the process adopted in the case of France in 1798.\r\n\r\n[It has been the usage for the Executive, when it communicates a treaty\r\nto the Senate for their ratification, to communicate also the\r\ncorrespondence of the negotiators. This having been omitted in case of\r\nthe Prussian treaty, was asked by a vote of the House, of February 12,\r\n1800, and was obtained. And in December, 1800, the convention of that\r\nyear between the United States and France, with the report of the\r\nnegotiations by the envoys, but not their instructions, being laid\r\nbefore the Senate, the instructions were asked for, and communicated by\r\nthe President.]\r\n\r\n[The mode of voting on questions of ratification is by nominal call.]\r\n\r\n[Whenever a treaty shall be laid before the Senate for ratification, it\r\nshall be read a first time for information only; when no motion to\r\nreject, ratify, or modify the whole, or any part, shall be received. Its\r\nsecond reading shall be for consideration, and on a subsequent day, when\r\nit shall be taken up as in a committee of the whole, and every one shall\r\nbe free to move a question on any particular article, in this form:\r\n“Will the Senate advise and consent to the ratification of this\r\narticle?” or to propose amendments thereto, either by inserting or by\r\nleaving out words, in which last case the question shall be: “Shall the\r\nwords stand part of the article?” And in every of the said cases, the\r\nconcurrence of two-thirds of the Senators present shall be requisite to\r\ndecide affirmatively. And when, through the whole, the proceedings shall\r\nbe stated to the House, and questions be again severally put thereon,\r\nfor confirmation, or new ones proposed, requiring in like manner a\r\nconcurrence of two-thirds for whatever is retained or inserted.]\r\n\r\n[The votes so confirmed shall, by the House, or a committee thereof, be\r\nreduced into the form of a ratification, with or without modifications,\r\nas may have been decided, and shall be proposed on a subsequent day,\r\nwhen every one shall again be free to move amendments, either by\r\ninserting or leaving out words; in which last case the question shall\r\nbe: “Shall the words stand part of the resolution?” And in both cases\r\nthe concurrence of two-thirds shall be requisite to carry the\r\naffirmative; as well as on the final question to advise and consent to\r\nthe ratification in the form agreed to. _Rule 37._]\r\n\r\n[When any question may have been decided by the Senate, in which\r\ntwo-thirds of the members present are necessary to carry the\r\naffirmative, any member who voted on that side which prevailed in the\r\nquestion may be at liberty to move for a reconsideration, and a motion\r\nfor reconsideration shall be decided by a majority of votes. _Rule\r\n37._]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION LIII.\r\n\r\nIMPEACHMENT.\r\n\r\n[The House of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment.\r\n_Const. U. S._, I, 3.]\r\n\r\n[The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When\r\nsitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation. When the\r\nPresident of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall\r\npreside; and no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of\r\ntwo-thirds of the members present. Judgment in cases of impeachment\r\nshall not extend further than to removal from office, and\r\ndisqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit\r\nunder the United States. But the party convicted shall nevertheless be\r\nliable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment\r\naccording to law. _Const._, I, 3.]\r\n\r\n[The President, Vice-President, and all civil officers of the United\r\nStates, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction\r\nof, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. _Const._,\r\nII, 4.]\r\n\r\n[The trial of crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury.\r\n_Const._, III, 2.]\r\n\r\nThese are the provisions of the Constitution of the United States on the\r\nsubject of impeachments. The following is a sketch of some of the\r\nprinciples and practices of England on the same subject:\r\n\r\n_Jurisdiction._ The Lords cannot impeach any to themselves, nor join in\r\nthe accusation, because they are the judges. _Seld. Judic. in Parl._,\r\n12, 63. Nor can they proceed against a commoner but on complaint of the\r\nCommons. _Ib._, 84. The Lords may not, by the law, try a commoner for a\r\ncapital offense, on the information of the King or a private person,\r\nbecause the accused is entitled to a trial by his peers generally; but\r\non accusation by the House of Commons, they may proceed against the\r\ndelinquent, of whatsoever degree, and whatsoever be the nature of the\r\noffense; for there they do not assume to themselves trial at common law.\r\nThe commons are then instead of a jury, and the judgment is given on\r\ntheir demand, which is instead of a verdict. So the Lords do only judge,\r\nbut not try the delinquent. _Ib._ 6, 7. But Wooddeson denies that a\r\ncommoner can now be charged capitally before the Lords, even by the\r\nCommons; and cites Fitzharris’s case, 1681, impeached for high treason,\r\nwhere the Lords remitted the prosecution to the inferior court. _8\r\nGrey’s Deb._, 325-7; _Wooddeson_, 601, 576; 3 _Seld._, 1610, 1619, 1641;\r\n4 _Blackst._, 25; _73 Seld._, 1604, 1618; 9, 1656.\r\n\r\n_Accusation._ The Commons, as the grand inquest of the nation, become\r\nsuitors for penal justice. 2 _Woodd._, 597; 6 _Grey_, 356. The general\r\ncourse is to pass a resolution containing a criminal charge against the\r\nsupposed delinquent, and then to direct some member to impeach him by\r\noral accusation, at the bar of the House of Lords, in the name of the\r\nCommons. The person signifies that the articles will be exhibited, and\r\ndesires that the delinquent may be sequestered from his seat, or be\r\ncommitted, or that the peers will take order from his appearance.\r\n_Sachev. Trial_, 325; _Woodd._, 602, 605; _Lords’ Jour. 3 June, 1701_,\r\n101; 1 _Wms._, 616; 6 _Grey_, 324.\r\n\r\n_Process._ If a party do not appear, proclamations are to be issued,\r\ngiving him a day to appear. On their return they are strictly examined.\r\nIf any error be found in them, a new proclamation issues, giving a short\r\nday. If he appear not, his goods may be arrested and they may proceed.\r\n_Seld. Jud._, 98, 99.\r\n\r\n_Articles._ The accusation (articles) of the Commons is substituted in\r\nplace of an indictment. Thus, by the usage of Parliament, in impeachment\r\nfor writing or speaking, the particular words need not be specified.\r\n_Sach. Tr._, 325; 2 _Woodd._, 602, 605; _Lords’ Jour., 3 June, 1701_; _1\r\nWms._, 616.\r\n\r\n_Appearance._ If he appears, and the case be capital, he answers in\r\ncustody; though not if the accusations be general. He is not to be\r\ncommitted but on special accusations. If it be for a misdemeanor only,\r\nhe answers a Lord in his place, a Commoner at the bar, and not in\r\ncustody, unless on the answer the Lords find cause to commit him, till\r\nhe finds sureties to attend, and lest he should fly. _Seld. Jud._, 98,\r\n99. A copy of the articles is given him, and a day fixed for his answer.\r\n_T. Ray_; 1 _Rushw._, 268; _Fost._, 232; 1 _Clar. Hist. of the Reb._,\r\n379. On a misdemeanor, his appearance may be in person, or he may answer\r\nin writing, or by attorney. _Seld. Jud._, 100. The general rule on\r\naccusation for a misdemeanor is, that in such a state of liberty or\r\nrestraint as the party is when the Commons complain of him, in such he\r\nis to answer. _Ib._, 101. If previously committed by the Commons, he\r\nanswers as a prisoner. But this may be called in some sort judicium\r\nparium snorum. _Ib._ In misdemeanors the party has a right to counsel by\r\nthe common law; but not in capital cases. _Seld. Jud._, 102-5.\r\n\r\n_Answer._ The answer need not observe great strictness of form. He may\r\nplead guilty as to part, and defend as to the residue; or, saving all\r\nexceptions, deny the whole or give a particular answer to each article\r\nseparately. 1 _Rush._, 274; 1 _Rush._, 1374; _12 Parl. Hist._, 442; _3\r\nLords’ Journ., 13 Nov., 1643_; _Woodd._, 607. But he cannot plead a\r\npardon in bar to the impeachment. 2 _Woodd._, 615; 2 _St. Tr._, 735.\r\n\r\n_Replication, rejoinder, etc._ There may be a replication, rejoinder,\r\netc. _Seld. Jud._, 114; 8 _Grey’s Deb._, 233; _Sach. Tr._, 15; _Journ.\r\nH. of Commons, 6 March, 1640_, 1.\r\n\r\n_Witnesses._ The practice is to swear the witnesses in open House, and\r\nthen examine them there; or a committee may be named, who shall examine\r\nthem in committee, either on interrogatories agreed on in the House, or\r\nsuch as the committee in their discretion shall demand. _Seld. Jud._,\r\n120, 123.\r\n\r\n_Jury._ In the case of Alice Pierce, 1 _R._ 2, a jury was impanneled for\r\nher trial before a committee. _Seld. Jud._, 123. But this was on a\r\ncomplaint, not on impeachment by the commons. _Seld. Jud._, 163. It must\r\nalso have been for a misdemeanor only, as the lords spiritual sat in the\r\ncase, which they do on misdemeanors, but not in capital cases. _Id._,\r\n148. The judgment was a forfeiture of all her lands and goods. _Id._,\r\n188. This, Seldon says, is the only jury he finds recorded in Parliament\r\nfor misdemeanor; but he makes no doubt, if the delinquent doth put\r\nhimself on trial of his country, a jury ought to be impanneled, and he\r\nadds that it is not so on impeachment by the commons; for they are in\r\nloco proprio, and there no jury ought to be impanneled. _Id._ 124. The\r\nLd. Berkely (6 _E._ 3) was arraigned for the murder of L. 2, on an\r\ninformation on the part of the King, and not on impeachment of the\r\ncommons; for then they had been patria sua. He waived his peerage, and\r\nwas tried by a jury of Gloucestershire and Warwickshire. _Id._, 125. In\r\n1 H. 7, the commons protest that they are not to be considered as\r\nparties to any judgment given, or hereafter to be given in Parliament.\r\n_Seld. Jud._, 133. They have been generally and more justly considered,\r\nas is before stated, as the grand jury; for the conceit of Seldom is\r\ncertainly not accurate, and they are the patria sua of the accused, and\r\nthat the lords do only judge, but not try. It is undeniable that they do\r\ntry; for they examine witnesses as to the facts, and acquit or condemn,\r\naccording to their own belief of them. And Lord Hale says “the peers are\r\njudges of law as well as of fact;” 2 _Hale, P. C._, 275; consequently of\r\nfact as well as of law.\r\n\r\n_Presence of Commons._ The commons are to be present at the examination\r\nof witnesses. _Seld. Jud._, 124. Indeed, they are to attend throughout,\r\neither as a committee of the whole House, or otherwise, at discretion,\r\nappoint managers to conduct the proofs. _Rushw. Tr. of Straff._, 37;\r\n_Com. Journ., 4 Feb., 1709-10_; 2 _Woodd._, 614. And judgment is not to\r\nbe given till they demand it. _Seld. Jud._, 124. But they are not to be\r\npresent on impeachment when the lords consider of the answer of proofs\r\nand determine of their judgment. Their presence, however, is necessary\r\nat the answer and judgment in cases capital (_Id._, 58, 159) as well as\r\nnot capital; (162.) The lords debate the judgment among themselves. Then\r\nthe vote is first taken on the question of guilty or not guilty; and if\r\nthey convict, the question, or particular sentence, is out of that which\r\nseemeth to be most generally agreed on. _Seld. Jud._, 167; 2 _Woodd._,\r\n612.\r\n\r\n_Judgment._ Judgments in Parliament, for death, have been strictly\r\nguided per legem terræ, which they cannot alter; and not at all\r\naccording to their discretion. They can neither omit any legal part of\r\nthe judgment nor add to it. Their sentence must be secundum, non ultra\r\nlegem. _Seld. Jud._, 168-171. This trial, though it varies in external\r\nceremony, yet differs not in essentials from criminal prosecutions\r\nbefore inferior courts. The same rules of evidence, the same legal\r\nnotions of crimes and punishments, prevailed; for impeachments are not\r\nframed to alter the law, but to carry it into more effectual execution\r\nagainst too powerful delinquents. The judgment, therefore, is to be such\r\nas is warranted by legal principles or precedents. 6 _Sta. Tr._, 14; _2\r\nWoodd._, 611. The Chancellor gives judgment in misdemeanors; the Lord\r\nHigh Steward formerly in cases of life and death. _Seld. Jud._, 180. But\r\nnow the Steward is deemed not necessary. _Fost._, 144; 2 _Woodd._, 613.\r\nIn misdemeanors the greatest corporal punishment hath been imprisonment.\r\n_Seld. Jud._, 184. The King’s assent is necessary in capital judgments\r\n(2 _Woodd._, 614, contra), but not in misdemeanors. _Seld. Jud._, 136.\r\n\r\n_Continuance._ An impeachment is not discontinued by the dissolution of\r\nParliament, but may be resumed by the new Parliament. _T. Ray._, 383; _4\r\nCom. Journ., 23 Dec., 1790_; _Lords’ Journ., May 15, 1791_; 2 _Woodd._,\r\n618.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nFirst Session of the First Legislative Assembly of Colorado, convened at\r\nDenver September 9th, and adjourned November 7th, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNCIL.\r\n\r\nE.

D. 1879, and at 12 o’clock M. on the first Wednesday in\r\nJanuary of each alternate year forever thereafter, and at other times\r\nwhen convened by the Governor.\r\n\r\nCustom, so prevalent and so ancient as to have the force of law, has\r\nmade it the duty of the clerk of the previous house to call to order,\r\nand to conduct the proceedings generally, until a speaker is chosen, but\r\nany member elect is competent to perform this duty.\r\n\r\nIn other States it is the custom for the Secretary of State to furnish\r\nto the clerk a certified statement of the names of the members elect,\r\nwhich is read. The members then advance to the clerk’s desk, generally\r\nthe delegation of each county by itself, and subscribe the oath of\r\noffice. But in this State the usual proceeding is to choose a Speaker\r\nand a clerk _pro tem._, and to appoint a committee who examine\r\ncredentials of members elect, and report to the House thus temporarily\r\norganized.\r\n\r\nThe oath of office is then administered to the members elect. It may be\r\nadministered by the President of the Senate, the Governor, Secretary of\r\nState, Attorney General, or any of the Judges of the Supreme Court. It\r\nhas been administered in this State usually by one of the judges.\r\n[_Members coming in after the first day of the session are sworn in by\r\nthe Speaker._] After all are sworn, the roll is called, when, if a\r\nquorum is found present, the Speaker _pro tem._ declares the House to be\r\nqualified and competent to proceed to business.\r\n\r\nIf the members present have determined their choice for officers, the\r\nelection proceeds forthwith; if not, an adjournment is had until the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nIt is determined by the House whether the election for Speaker, Clerk,\r\nand Sergeant-at-arms and the subordinate officers shall be by ballot,\r\nviva voce, or otherwise.\r\n\r\nCandidates for Speaker are nominated and the vote taken.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker _pro tem._ announces the result, and names a committee to\r\nconduct the Speaker elect to the chair. The other elections proceed in\r\nthe same manner, except that when the result is announced by the\r\nSpeaker, the officer elect advances to the Clerk’s desk and is sworn in\r\nby the Speaker.\r\n\r\nA committee is then appointed to wait on the Senate, and inform them\r\nthat the House is organized; or the Clerk is directed, by resolution, to\r\ninform the Senate of the fact.\r\n\r\nOne of the first duties after organization is the adoption of rules for\r\nthe government of the House.\r\n\r\nIt is customary for the Speaker to appoint a committee of three to meet\r\nwith a committee of three from the Senate for the purpose of forming\r\njoint rules for the government of both houses; and when completed, the\r\ncommittees report to their respective houses.\r\n\r\nBy concurrent resolution both houses meet in joint convention to canvass\r\nthe vote for executive officers.\r\n\r\nWhen it has been determined who are the executive officers, a joint\r\ncommittee of both houses is then appointed to wait on the Governor and\r\ninform him that both Houses of the General Assembly are organized, and\r\nthat the houses are in readiness to receive any communication from him.\r\n\r\nThe Senate and House usually assemble in joint convention in the chamber\r\nof the House upon some day and hour suggested by the Governor, during\r\nthe first week of the session to hear his message.\r\n\r\nThe message is usually read by the Executive, but may be read by his\r\nprivate secretary, or by any one the Governor may appoint.\r\n\r\nAt the first opportunity after hearing the message read, the various\r\nrecommendations therein contained are referred, by resolution, to\r\nappropriate standing committees, or select committees.\r\n\r\nStanding committees are appointed by the Speaker at as early a day in\r\nthe session as is possible. Each committee usually consists of five\r\nmembers, but the House determines the number which is sometimes three,\r\nor nine, or eleven, or any other number.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAWING OF SEATS.\r\n\r\nIn other States the seats are drawn by lot. The method pursued is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe members leave their seats, and take places in the open area behind\r\ntheir seats. The clerk having placed in a box slips of paper containing\r\nthe names of the members respectively, a page or messenger draws them\r\ntherefrom. The clerk announces each name as it is drawn, and the member\r\nnamed selects his seat, and occupies it until the drawing is completed.\r\n\r\nIn this State it is not customary to draw seats by any method. The seats\r\nare usually chosen with the view of grouping together those who\r\nrepresent similar interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATION.\r\n\r\nEach member of the General Assembly, as a compensation for his services\r\nshall receive four dollars for each day’s attendance, and fifteen cents\r\nfor every mile necessarily travelled in going to and returning from the\r\nseat of government, and shall receive no other compensation, perquisite,\r\nor allowance whatsoever. It is customary to pay the mileage of members\r\nboth ways, upon the certificate of the Speaker and clerk as to the\r\nproper sum to which each member is entitled.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAY OF OFFICERS.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker of the House shall be entitled to receive the same\r\ncompensation allowed to other members of the Legislature. The per diem\r\nof officers of the Legislature shall be as follows: The chief clerk, six\r\ndollars; the assistant clerk, five dollars; sergeant-at-arms, assistant\r\nsergeant-at-arms, engrossing clerk, assistant engrossing clerk, and\r\nenrolling clerk, each four dollars; messenger, door-keeper, janitor, and\r\ninterpreter, each three dollars; chaplain, two dollars; pages, assistant\r\ndoor-keeper, and janitor, each one dollar and fifty cents.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n_Speaker_--The duties of this officer are generally as follows:\r\n\r\nTo open the session, at the time to which the House stands adjourned, by\r\ntaking the chair and calling the members to order.\r\n\r\nTo announce the business before the House in the order in which it is to\r\nbe acted upon.\r\n\r\nTo receive and submit, in the proper manner, all motions and\r\npropositions presented by the members.\r\n\r\nTo put to vote all questions which are regularly moved, or which\r\nnecessarily arise in the course of proceedings, and to announce the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nTo restrain the members, when engaged in debate, within the rules of\r\norder.\r\n\r\nTo enforce on all occasions the observance of order and decorum among\r\nthe members.\r\n\r\nTo inform the House, when necessary, or when referred to for the\r\npurpose, on a point of order or practice.\r\n\r\nTo receive messages and other communications from other branches of the\r\ngovernment, and announce them to the House.\r\n\r\nTo authenticate by his signature, when necessary, all the acts, orders\r\nand proceedings of the House.\r\n\r\nTo name the members--when directed to do so in a particular case, or\r\nwhen it is a part of his general duty by the rules--who are to serve on\r\ncommittees, and in general.\r\n\r\nTo represent and stand for the House, declaring its will, and in all\r\nthings obeying its commands. Every officer of the House is subordinate\r\nto the Speaker, and in all that relates to the prompt and correct\r\ndischarge of official duty, is under his supervision.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker shall preserve order and decorum; may speak to points of\r\norder in preference to others, rising from his seat for that purpose;\r\nand he shall decide questions of order, subject to an appeal to the\r\nHouse by any member, on which appeal no member shall speak more than\r\nonce, unless by leave of the House. On an appeal being taken, the\r\nquestion shall be: “Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the\r\njudgment of the House?”----which question, and the action of the House\r\nthereon, shall be entered on the journal.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker may call a member to the Chair, but such substitution shall\r\nnot extend beyond one day, except by leave of the House.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker shall vote on all questions taken by yeas and nays, and on\r\nall elections or divisions called for by any member.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of the Speaker, the House shall elect a Speaker _pro\r\ntempore_, whose office shall cease on the return of the Speaker.\r\n\r\n_Clerk_--He has the care and custody of all the papers and records, and\r\narranges in its proper order, from day to day, after its inception, all\r\nthe business of the House.

The duties of his subordinates are properly his duties, as\r\nall are performed under his direction, and he is responsible for any\r\ndeficiencies.

They are not to exhibit to any\r\nperson any bill or other document in their possession without leave of\r\nthe clerk.\r\n\r\nPerfect courtesy must at all times be maintained towards members,\r\nreporters, associate deputies, and all who have business to transact\r\nwith the department; but interference with legislation cannot be allowed\r\nunder any circumstances.\r\n\r\n_To Members, Officers and Reporters_--It is especially requested that no\r\nmember, officer or reporter will interrupt the assistant clerk while\r\nengaged in keeping the journal. “No journal, record, account or paper,”\r\nof any kind may be taken from the desk, unless by express permission of\r\nthe clerk.\r\n\r\n_Sergeant-at-Arms_--This officer is the executive officer of the House.\r\nHe has charge of the chambers and appurtenant conveniences of the House.\r\nHe controls the police regulations, attends to the warming of the\r\nchambers, serves the subpœnas and warrants of the House, announces\r\nmessages from the Governor and from the Senate, provides rooms for\r\ncommittees, receives from the Secretary of State all public documents\r\nordered or coming in due course, and distributes the same through the\r\npost-office, or otherwise, to members and officers entitled thereto. He\r\nis to organize his department with such system that each of his\r\nsubordinates shall know his precise duties, and he is to see that each\r\nperforms his duty promptly, thoroughly and courteously. He is required\r\nto keep the chamber open from 8 o’clock A. M. to 10 o’clock P. M.\r\n\r\nHe should have the printed bills and other documents in his possession\r\nso classified and arranged that he can at once answer any call upon him\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nHis assistant assists him generally in the discharge of his duties, and\r\ntakes his place when he is absent.\r\n\r\n_The Door Keeper_ attends to the principal door; opens and closes it\r\nfor the entry and exit of all persons; maintains order in the lobby and\r\nvestibule; sees that visitors are seated, and that the regulations of\r\nthe House, in his department, are strictly enforced.\r\n\r\n_The Assistant Door Keepers_, each at their respective stations, are to\r\ndischarge the same duties as the principal door keeper. They must be in\r\nattendance as well during the recess as the sessions of the House to\r\nkeep out intruders and maintain order.\r\n\r\n_The Firemen_ attend to the warming and ventilation of the House\r\nchamber, and under the direction of the sergeant-at-arms, make\r\nthemselves generally useful.\r\n\r\nThe door keepers and firemen are responsible to the sergeant-at-arms.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF MESSENGERS.\r\n\r\nTo be in attendance from 8 o’clock A. M. until 10 o’clock P.

The\r\nHouse determines what papers, and how many, shall be furnished.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESS OF PASSING BILLS.\r\n\r\nSome diversity of practice exists herein, but the ordinary method in the\r\nHouse is as follows:\r\n\r\nA member having prepared a bill and endorsed the title thereof, together\r\nwith his name, upon the back of it, rises to his feet, at such time as\r\nthe introduction of bills is in order, and says:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Speaker.”\r\n\r\nIf recognized, the Speaker responds:\r\n\r\n“The gentleman from ----.”\r\n\r\nThe member announces:\r\n\r\n“I ask leave to introduce a bill.”\r\n\r\nThe bill is then sent to the Clerk by a messenger. The Clerk then reads\r\nthe title of the bill, and places it on file for its first reading, and\r\nwhen the order for the first reading of bills is reached, the Clerk\r\nreads the first bill on file _at length_, when the Speaker announces:\r\n\r\n“First reading of the bill.”\r\n\r\nThe second reading of bills must be on a day subsequent to their first\r\nreading. When the Speaker calls for the second reading of bills, the\r\nClerk reads the first bill on file for second reading _at length_, when\r\nthe Speaker announces:\r\n\r\n“Second reading of the bill.”\r\n\r\nThe bill is then usually referred to such standing committee, or select\r\ncommittee, or to the general file for Committee of the Whole, as the\r\nHouse may determine.\r\n\r\nIf the bill has been referred to a standing committee, or select\r\ncommittee, it is in due course reported back to the House by the\r\ncommittee, when it is placed in the general file.\r\n\r\nBills in the general file are usually considered in Committee of the\r\nWhole in the exact order in which they are placed upon the file.\r\nProceedings in Committee of the Whole will be elsewhere considered.\r\n\r\nAfter a Committee of the Whole has completed its action upon any bill,\r\nand reported the same back to the House, and any recommendations made by\r\nthe committee passed upon, it is taken up in its order, when the Speaker\r\nputs the following question:\r\n\r\n“Shall this bill be engrossed, and read a third time?”\r\n\r\nIf decided affirmatively the bill is thereby referred to the engrossing\r\ncommittee. Upon its return engrossed from the engrossing clerk, the\r\noriginal and engrossed bills are placed in the hands of the _Committee\r\non Engrossed Bills_, who compare them and correct any errors which they\r\nmay find. When found correct, or made so, the committee report them to\r\nthe House as correctly engrossed, when the original is filed by the\r\nClerk, and the engrossed bill goes into the order of “bills ready for a\r\nthird reading.”\r\n\r\nWhen, under the order of business, the bill is reached, the title of the\r\nbill is read, and the bill itself is read _at length_, when the Speaker\r\nsays as follows:\r\n\r\n“This bill having been read three several times, the question is: Shall\r\nthe bill pass?”\r\n\r\nIf the bill passes it is taken to the Senate, with a message announcing\r\nits passage by the House, and asking the concurrence of the Senate\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nGoing through with a similar process in the Senate, it is returned with\r\na message announcing their action upon it.\r\n\r\nIf the Senate concurs, the bill is sent to the Enrolling Clerk, who\r\nmakes a copy thereof, as is elsewhere described. When enrolled, it goes\r\nto the _Committee on Enrolled Bills_, who compare it with the engrossed\r\nbill. When found or made correct, they report the bill to the House as\r\ncorrectly enrolled; the engrossed bill is filed by the Clerk; the\r\nenrolled bill is then endorsed by the Clerk as having originated in the\r\nHouse (for the information of the Governor, in case he vetoes it). It is\r\nthen referred to a joint committee of enrollment, who present the same\r\nto the Speaker, who has the title of the bill read in hearing of the\r\nHouse, and then signs it, after which the joint committee present the\r\nbill to the President of the Senate, who has the title of the bill read\r\nin hearing of the Senate, and then signs it. The committee then proceed\r\nto the Governor and present the bill thus duly signed for his approval,\r\nand report that fact to the House, and the hour when it was deposited in\r\nthe Governor’s hands. The Governor, if he approves the bill, informs the\r\nHouse in which it originated of that fact, and that he has deposited it\r\nwith the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThis is the ordinary process of a bill through all its stages until it\r\nbecomes a law. A bill of great interest or importance, or one which is\r\nwarmly contested, may, by reason of majority and minority reports,\r\nspecial orders, recommitment, amendments, substitutes, committees of\r\nconference, and various other parliamentary appliances, pass through a\r\nvast number of stages not before enumerated.\r\n\r\nSenate bills coming into the House after passing the Senate, are read\r\ntwice by title and then read _at length_, and then referred to the\r\nappropriate committee.\r\n\r\nAfter consideration in Committee of the Whole, the recommendation of\r\nthe committee is acted upon in the House, the question being, after\r\nrecommendations are disposed of:\r\n\r\n“Shall this bill be ordered to a third reading?”\r\n\r\nIf it is decided affirmatively, the bill passes into the order of “bills\r\non third reading;” and when reached in that order, the question is:\r\n\r\n“Shall this bill be concurred in?”\r\n\r\nIf concurred in, the bill is returned to the Senate, with the message\r\ninforming it of that fact.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of the Whole is an expedient to simplify the business of\r\nlegislative bodies. No record is made of its proceedings, and it has no\r\nofficers except of its own creation, for temporary purposes. It is\r\nliable to instant dissolution in case of disorder, when the Speaker\r\ntakes the chair for a Call of the House, or an adjournment, and in case\r\nof a message from the Senate or Governor, when the Speaker takes the\r\nchair to receive it.\r\n\r\nThe House may resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole upon some\r\nparticular bill, resolution or subject, or it may go into Committee of\r\nthe Whole upon the general file of bills.\r\n\r\nIn the first case the motion is:\r\n\r\n“That the House do now resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole upon\r\n[bill No. ----, A, a bill ----], or [joint resolution No. ----, A,\r\nproviding, etc.], or [upon all bills relating to ----], as the case may\r\nbe.”\r\n\r\nIn the second case it is:\r\n\r\n“That the House do now resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole upon\r\nthe general file of bills.”\r\n\r\nBills, resolutions, and general matters which have been once considered\r\nin committee of the whole, and in which progress has been made, and\r\nleave granted for further consideration, have the preference. The motion\r\nof the Committee of the Whole, for their further consideration, must be\r\nmade under the head of “bills in which the committee of the whole have\r\nmade progress and obtained leave to sit again;” and in which case the\r\nmember who presided when the same matter was previously considered in\r\ncommittee of the whole, resumes the chair.\r\n\r\nThe motion for the committee of the whole upon the general file, must\r\nbe made under the order of “bills not yet considered in committee of the\r\nwhole.”\r\n\r\nWhen the House resolves itself into committee of the whole, the Speaker\r\nselects a chairman as follows:\r\n\r\n“The gentleman from ----, Mr ----, will take the chair.”\r\n\r\nThe appointed chairman advances to the Speaker’s desk, and having taken\r\nthe chair, receives from the clerk the papers indicated by the motion\r\nfor the committee, when the chairman announces:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,--The committee have under consideration bill No. ----,\r\nentitled ----” (_reading the title from the back of the bill_). _Or in\r\ncase of consideration of the general file_: “The committee have under\r\nconsideration the general file of bills; the first in order is bill No.\r\n----, A, entitled ----. The first section is as follows.”\r\n\r\nThe chairman then reads the first section, and asks:\r\n\r\n“Are there any amendments proposed to the first section?”\r\n\r\nIf none are offered, the chairman says:\r\n\r\n“No amendments being offered to the first section, the second section\r\nwill be read.”\r\n\r\nThis process is continued through the whole bill, when at the close of\r\nthe reading the chairman says:\r\n\r\n“The ----th section and the whole bill have now been read, and are open\r\nto amendment.”\r\n\r\nAt this point, after the friends of the bill have perfected it, it is\r\ncustomary for the opponents of the bill to open their attack. After the\r\ndiscussion of the bill to such an extent as may be desired, if no\r\namendments are made, the final vote is generally upon a motion--\r\n\r\n“That the bill be reported back to the House without amendment.”\r\n\r\nIf any other bills are before the committee, they are proceeded with in\r\nthe same manner. If it is desired to have further consideration of any\r\nmatter before the committee, or if the general file has not been gone\r\nthrough with, the motion is:\r\n\r\n“That the committee rise, report progress, and ask leave to sit again.”\r\n\r\nIf the committee has completed its duties, the motion is:\r\n\r\n“That the committee rise and report.”\r\n\r\nWhich being analagous to a motion to adjourn, is not debatable. The\r\nchairman states the matter as follows:\r\n\r\n“It is moved that the committee do now rise and report (_or otherwise,\r\nas the case may be_).”\r\n\r\n“Is the committee ready for the question?”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,--Those who are of opinion that this committee do now rise\r\nand report, say ‘Aye;’ those of a contrary opinion say ‘No.’”\r\n\r\nIn case of doubt a division must be had, as the ayes and noes cannot be\r\ncalled in committee of the whole.\r\n\r\nWhen the committee rises, the Speaker resumes his seat, and the\r\nchairman, in his place on the floor, reports as follows:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Speaker.”\r\n\r\nThe Speaker answers:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Chairman.”\r\n\r\nWho reports:\r\n\r\n“The committee of the whole have had under consideration bill No. ----,\r\nA, entitled ----, and have instructed me to report the same to the House\r\nwith amendment” (_or as the case may be_).\r\n\r\nWhen the general file has been under consideration, the report is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“The committee of the whole have had under consideration the general\r\nfile of bills, have gone through the same, and have directed me to\r\nreport to the House the bills contained therein, with sundry amendments\r\nand recommendations as follows, to-wit:” [_Here follows the titles of\r\nbills considered, with action taken upon them._]\r\n\r\nIn case the file has been left unfinished, the report is:\r\n\r\n“The committee of the whole have had under consideration the general\r\nfile of bills, and have made some progress therein. I am directed to\r\nreport back the following bills, with the amendments and recommendations\r\nhereinafter specified, and ask leave for the committee to sit again.”\r\n[_Here follows the report of amendments, etc., as above._]\r\n\r\nIn the latter report the question is:\r\n\r\n“Shall leave be granted?”\r\n\r\nWhen, upon a count, it is ascertained that a quorum is not present, the\r\nreport is:\r\n\r\n“The committee of the whole have had under consideration ----, and,\r\nafter some progress therein, find there is no quorum present; that fact\r\nI herewith report to you.”\r\n\r\nIn case of confusion or disorder, the Speaker, of his own accord,\r\nresumes the chair temporarily and without any formality, for the purpose\r\nof suppressing it. When order is restored the chairman resumes the\r\nchair, and the business proceeds.\r\n\r\nUpon the coming in of a report, the recommendations are usually at once\r\nacted on by the House.\r\n\r\nWhen, in committee of the whole, any member desires to offer an\r\namendment, it must be reduced to writing and sent to the chairman, who\r\nreads it, and asks:\r\n\r\n“Is the committee ready for the question upon the amendment?”\r\n\r\nAnd if no further amendment or debate offer, he puts the question in the\r\nusual manner.\r\n\r\nAfter a section is once passed, with an unsuccessful effort to amend it,\r\nno further amendments are in order. The strictness of this rule is,\r\nhowever, not always adhered to; an amendment once made may, however, be\r\nreconsidered. Such a motion is:\r\n\r\n“That the amendment offered by the gentleman from ----, to the ----th\r\nsection, be reconsidered.”\r\n\r\nAnd is stated as follows:\r\n\r\n“The gentleman from ---- moves that the amendment of the gentleman from\r\n---- to the ----th section be reconsidered.”\r\n\r\n“Is the committee ready for the question?”\r\n\r\n“Those who are of the opinion that said amendment be reconsidered say\r\n‘Aye;’ those of the contrary opinion say ‘No.’”\r\n\r\nIn case the amendment is reconsidered, the Speaker says:\r\n\r\n“The motion is carried. The amendment is reconsidered. The question now\r\nrecurs upon the adoption of the amendment. Is the committee ready for\r\nthe question?” etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMS.\r\n\r\nOf Titles:\r\n\r\nNo. ----, a bill to ----.\r\n\r\n_Amending Bill_:\r\n\r\nA bill relating to ----, and amendatory of section ----, of chapter\r\n----, of the ----.\r\n\r\n_Repealing Bill_:\r\n\r\nA bill to repeal section ----, of chapter ----, of the ----, relating to\r\n---- (filling the blanks with the proper section and chapter of the\r\nrevised statutes or general laws, designating the same, and also the\r\nsubject, object or purpose of the section of the chapter repealed; and\r\nin the body of every bill, the full title of the act repealed shall be\r\nrecited at length).\r\n\r\n_Appropriation Bill_:\r\n\r\n“To appropriate to ---- the sum of ---- dollars.”\r\n\r\nTitles should be written inside the bill, and endorsed upon the outside\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  No. ----, A.\r\n  _A Bill to change the name of\r\n  Andrew Jackson to James Madison._\r\n\r\n  MR. GORDEN.\r\n\r\nResolutions should not be entitled, but should have the name of the\r\nmover endorsed upon them. The same rule applies to amendments.\r\n\r\nResolutions are of no special form; the following may serve as a general\r\nguide in such matters:\r\n\r\nRes. No. ----, A.\r\n\r\n“_Resolved_,--That three thousand copies of the Governor’s message be\r\nfurnished by the printer to the Sergeant-at-Arms, for the use of the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n  “MR. TUCKER.”\r\n\r\nFor reports the following form is used:\r\n\r\n“The committee on ----, to which was referred bill No. ----, A., a bill\r\nto ----, _respectfully report the same back to the House with an\r\namendment, and recommend its passage when amended_;” or, “_and recommend\r\nthat it do pass_;” or, “_and recommend that it be indefinitely\r\npostponed_;” or, “_and recommend that it be referred to the delegation\r\nfrom ----_;” or, “_to a select committee_.”\r\n\r\nOr, if the committee report by bill:\r\n\r\n“The committee on ----, to which was referred ----, respectfully report\r\n“by bill No. ----, A., a bill to ----;\r\n\r\n“And recommend its passage.”\r\n\r\nAn enacting clause must precede the body of the bill.\r\n\r\nIt must _invariably_ be in the following form:\r\n\r\n_Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado: Const.,\r\nArt. 5, Sec. 18._\r\n\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATIONS.\r\n\r\nWhen an investigation is required into any matter, the person most\r\ninterested in having the inquiry made, should move the appointment of a\r\ncommittee to take the subject in charge. This is done by resolution. The\r\nresolution should be so drawn as to state the precise subject to be\r\ninvestigated, and to give the committee all the power which the mover\r\nmay deem necessary to a thorough examination into the subject matter to\r\nbe laid before them; this should be done to prevent any misapprehension\r\nas to the intention and extent of the inquiry to be made. In case of the\r\nadoption of the resolution, the mover, together with other members, will\r\nbe appointed a committee. They have power to send for persons and\r\npapers. The form of a subpœna is as follows:\r\n\r\n  “THE STATE OF COLORADO, }\r\n\r\n“To ---- ----: You are hereby commanded, that, laying aside all business\r\nand excuse, you personally appear and attend before Messrs. ---- ----,\r\non the part of the Senate, and Messrs. ---- ----, on the part of the\r\nHouse, a _joint_ committee appointed under a resolution of the Senate\r\nand House, to investigate at the room of said committee ----, in the\r\ncity of Denver, the capital of the State, on the ---- day of -----, A.\r\nD. one thousand eight hundred and ----, at the hour of ---- in the ----\r\nnoon, then and there, and from time to time, as required by said\r\ncommittee, to testify and give evidence upon the matters of inquiry\r\nbefore said committee.\r\n\r\n“Hereof fail not, under penalty in such case made and provided.\r\n\r\n“Given at the House chamber, in the city of Denver aforesaid, this ----\r\nday of ----, A.

The ratio thus\r\nascertained under the census of 1860 was 126,823; and upon this basis\r\nthe 233 Representatives were apportioned among the several States, one\r\nRepresentative for every district containing that number of persons;\r\ngiving to each State at least one Representative. Subsequently, by the\r\nact of March 4, 1862, the ratio was changed, and the number of\r\nRepresentatives from and after March 3, 1863, was increased from 233 to\r\n241, by allowing one additional Representative to each of the following\r\nStates, viz: Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania,\r\nRhode Island, and Vermont; and this number was increased by the\r\nadmission of Nevada and Nebraska with one Representative each, to 243.\r\n\r\n[13] As per apportionment bill passed February 2, 1872, and supplemental\r\napportionment bill passed May 30, 1872.\r\n\r\n[14] Previous to the 3d of March, 1820, Maine formed part of\r\nMassachusetts, and was called the “District of Maine,” and its\r\nrepresentatives are numbered with those of Massachusetts. By compact\r\nbetween Maine and Massachusetts, Maine became a separate and independent\r\nState, and by act of Congress of 3d March, 1820, was admitted into the\r\nUnion as such; the admission to take place on the fifteenth of the same\r\nmonth. On the 7th of April, 1820, Maine was declared entitled to seven\r\nrepresentatives, to be taken from those of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n[15] Divided by action of State Legislature and Congress in 1861 and\r\n1862, and State of West Virginia created therefrom.\r\n\r\n[16] Admitted under act of Congress of June 1, 1796, with one\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\n[17] Admitted under act of Congress of April 30, 1802, with one\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\n[18] Admitted under act of Congress of April 8, 1812, with one\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\n[19] Admitted under act of Congress of Dec. 11, 1816, with three\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n[20] Admitted under act of Congress of Dec. 10, 1817, with one\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\n[21] Admitted under act of Congress of Dec. 3, 1818, with one\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\n[22] Admitted under act of Congress of Dec. 14, 1819, with three\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n[23] Admitted under act of Congress of March 2, 1821, with one\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\n[24] Admitted under act of Congress of Jan. 26, 1837, with one\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\n[25] Admitted under act of Congress of Jan. 15, 1836, with one\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\n[26] Admitted under act of Congress of March 8, 1845, with one\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\n[27] Admitted under act of Congress of March 3, 1845, with two\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n[28] Admitted under act of Congress of Dec. 29, 1848, with two\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n[29] Admitted under act of Congress of May 29, 1848, with two\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n[30] Admitted under act of Congress of Sept. 8, 1848, with two\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n[31] Admitted under act of Congress of May 11, 1858, with two\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n[32] Admitted under act of Congress of Feb. 14, 1859, with one\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\n[33] Admitted under act of Congress of Jan. 29, 1861, with one\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\n[34] Previous to December 31, 1862, West Virginia was a part of the\r\nState of Virginia, which State was entitled to eleven Members of the\r\nHouse of Representatives.\r\n\r\n[35] Admitted under act of Congress of October 31, 1864, with one\r\nRepresentative.\r\n\r\n[36] Admitted under act of Congress of January, 1867, and proclamation\r\nof the President, March 1, 1867, with one Representative.\r\n\r\n[37] Admitted under act of Congress of March 3, 1875, and proclamation\r\nof the President, July 4th, 1876, with one representative.\r\n\r\n[38] RULE 23. The Vice-President or President of the Senate pro tempore,\r\nshall have the right to name a member to perform the duties of the\r\nChair; but such substitution shall not extend beyond an amendment.\r\n\r\n[39] RULE 34. The following Standing Committees, shall be appointed at\r\nthe commencement of each session, with leave to report by bill or\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Foreign Relations to consist of seven members.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Finance to consist of seven members.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Manufactures to consist of five members.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Agriculture to consist of seven members.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Military Affairs, and Militia, to consist of seven\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Naval Affairs, to consist of seven members.\r\n\r\nA Committee on the Judiciary, to consist of seven members.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads, to consist of seven members.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Public Lands, to consist of seven members.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Private Land Claims, to consist of five members.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Indian Affairs, to consist of seven members.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Pensions, to consist of seven members.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Revolutionary Claims, to consist of five members.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Claims, to consist of five members.\r\n\r\nA Committee on the District of Columbia, to consist of seven members.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Patents and Patent Office, to consist of five members.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, to consist of five members,\r\nwho shall have power also to act jointly with the same committee of the\r\nHouse of Representatives.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Territories, to consist of seven members.\r\n\r\nA Committee on the Pacific Railroad, to consist of nine members.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Mines and Mining, to consist of seven members.\r\n\r\nA Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expenses of the Senate,\r\nto consist of three members, to whom shall be referred all resolutions\r\ndirecting the payment of money out of the contingent fund of the Senate,\r\nor creating a charge on the same.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Engrossed Bills, to consist of three members, whose duty\r\nit shall be to examine all bills, amendments, resolutions or motions,\r\nbefore they go out of the possession of the Senate, and shall deliver\r\nthe same to the Secretary of the Senate, who shall enter upon the\r\njournal that the same have been correctly engrossed.\r\n\r\nA Committee on Enrolled Bills, to consist of three members.\r\n\r\n[40] The former practice of the Senate referred to in this paragraph has\r\nbeen changed by the following Rule:\r\n\r\n[RULE 29. The final question upon the second reading of every bill,\r\nresolution, constitutional amendment or motion, originating in the\r\nSenate, and requiring three readings previous to being passed, shall be,\r\n“Whether it shall be engrossed and read a third time?” and no amendment\r\nshall be received for discussion at the third reading of any bill,\r\nresolution, amendment, or motion, unless by unanimous consent of the\r\nmembers present; but it shall at all times be in order before the final\r\npassage of any such bill, resolution, constitutional amendment, or\r\nmotion, to move its commitment; and should such commitment take place,\r\nand any amendment be reported by the committee, the said bill,\r\nresolution, constitutional amendment, or motion, shall be again read a\r\nsecond time, and considered as in Committee of the Whole, and then the\r\naforesaid question shall be again put.]\r\n\r\n[41] This rule has been modified so as to specify the questions entitled\r\nto preference. The rule is now as follows:\r\n\r\n[When a question is under debate, no motion shall be received but to\r\nadjourn, to lay on the table, to postpone indefinitely, to postpone to a\r\nday certain, to commit, or to amend; which several motions shall have\r\nprecedence in the order they stand arranged, and the motion for\r\nadjournment shall always be in order, and be decided without debate.]\r\n\r\n[42] RULE 13. In filling up blanks, the largest sum and longest time\r\nshall be first put.\r\n\r\n[43] In the case of a division of the question, and a decision against\r\nstriking out, I advance doubtingly the opinion here expressed. I find no\r\nauthority either way, and I know it may be viewed under a different\r\naspect. It may be thought that, having decided separately not to strike\r\nout the passage, the same question for striking out cannot be put over\r\nagain, though with a view to a different insertion. Still I think it\r\nmore reasonable and convenient to consider the striking out and\r\ninsertion as forming one proposition; but should readily yield to any\r\nevidence that the contrary is the practice in Parliament.\r\n\r\n[44] Noes. 9 Grey, 365.\r\n\r\n[45] The rule now fixes a limitation.\r\n\r\n[46] Seat unsuccessfully contested by C.
