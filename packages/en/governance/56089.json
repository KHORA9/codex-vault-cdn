The world is beginning to have an idea of its\r\nimportance. Those who have long known it, who have given attention\r\nto its traditions and the sources of its social and industrial\r\nstrength, have the conviction that China will become a factor of the\r\nfirst magnitude in the composition of the world of the twentieth\r\ncentury. They have penetrated beyond the idea that China is a land\r\nof topsy-turvy, the main function of which is to amuse the outsider\r\nwith unexpected social customs, and which, from a political point of\r\nview, is in a state bordering upon chaos. When we ask ourselves what\r\nare the elements which may constitute China's contribution to the\r\nfuture civilization of the world, what are the characteristics which\r\nrender her civilization significant to all of us, we enter upon a\r\nsubject that would in itself require a volume merely to present in\r\noutline. From the point of view of social action, there is the widely\r\ndiffused sense of popular equity which has enabled Chinese society for\r\nthese many centuries to govern itself, to maintain property rights,\r\npersonal honour and dignity without recourse to written law or set\r\ntribunals, chiefly through an informal enforcement by society itself\r\nacting through many agencies, of that underlying sense of proportion\r\nand rightness which lives in the hearts of the people. From the point\r\nof view of economic life, China presents the picture of a society in\r\nwhich work has not been robbed of its joy, in which the satisfaction\r\nof seeing the product of industry grow in the hands of the craftsman\r\nstill forms the chief reward of a labour performed with patient toil\r\nbut without heartbreaking drudgery. From the point of view of social\r\norganization, China forms an extremely intricate organism in which\r\nthe specific relationship between definite individuals counts far\r\nmore than any general principles or ideas. Loyalty, piety, a sense of\r\nfitness give meaning to the ceremonial of Chinese social life, which\r\nis more than etiquette as a mere ornament of social intercourse in\r\nthat it bodies forth in visible form as every-day observances, the\r\nrelations and duties upon which society rests. From the point of view\r\nof art, China stands for a refinement of quality which attests the\r\nloving devotion of generations to the idea of a perfect product; in the\r\nrepresentative arts, calmness of perception has enabled the Chinese to\r\nset a model for the artistic reproduction of the environments of human\r\nlife. In their conception of policy and world position, the Chinese\r\npeople have ever shown a readiness to base any claim to ascendancy\r\nupon inherent excellence and virtue. They have not imposed upon their\r\nneighbours any artificial authority, though they have proudly received\r\nthe homage and admiration due their noble culture.\r\n\r\nAt this time, when the Far Eastern question is the chief subject-matter\r\nof international conferences and negotiations, China stands before\r\nthe world in the eyes of those who really know her, not as a bankrupt\r\npleader for indulgence and assistance, but as a great unit of human\r\ntradition and force which, heretofore somewhat over-disdainful of the\r\nthings through which other nations had won power and preference and\r\nmechanical mastery, has lived a trifle carelessly in the assurance that\r\nreal strength must rest on inner virtue; China has made no use of the\r\narts of self-advertisement, but has felt within her the consciousness\r\nof a great human force that must ultimately prevail over petty\r\nintrigue and forceful aggression. The secular persistence of Chinese\r\ncivilization has given to the Chinese an inner strength and confidence\r\nwhich make them bear up even when the aggressiveness of nations more\r\neffectively organized for attack seems to render their position\r\nwell-nigh desperate. Can the world fail to realize that if this vast\r\nsociety can continue to live according to its traditions of peace and\r\nuseful industry instead of being made the battleground of contending\r\nImperial interests, the peace of the world will be more truly advanced\r\nthan it may be by any covenants of formal contrivance? Declarations,\r\ntreaties, and leagues are all useful instruments, but unless the\r\nnations agree without afterthought to respect the life and civilization\r\nof China, all professions of world betterment would be belied in fact.\r\nIf China is to be looked upon as material for the imperialist policies\r\nof others, peace conferences will discuss and resolve in vain.\r\n\r\nDuring the six years of my work in China I was constantly surrounded\r\nby the evidences of the transition of Chinese life to new methods and\r\naims. In all its complex phases this enormous transformation passed\r\nin review before my eyes, in all its deep significance, not only for\r\nChina and the Far East, but for the whole world. It was this that made\r\nlife and work in China at this time so intensely fascinating. A new\r\nform of government had been adopted. As I represented the Republic\r\nupon which it had been largely modeled, whose spirit the Chinese were\r\nanxious to follow, it fell to me to counsel with Chinese leaders as\r\nif I had been one of their number. The experience of a great American\r\ncommonwealth which had itself successfully endeavoured to raise its\r\norganization to a higher plane was of unending assistance to me in\r\nenabling me to see the Chinese problems as part of what right-thinking\r\nmen were struggling for throughout the world. The most discouraging\r\nfeature was, however, that the needs of China so often took the form of\r\nemergencies in which it seemed futile to plan at long range, in which\r\nimmediate help was necessary. Where one was coöperating with a group of\r\nmen beset by overpowering difficulties of the moment, it often seemed\r\nacademic even to think of the general improvement of political and\r\neconomic organization, over a longer range of time. The old elements\r\nof the Imperial régime, the traditional methods of basing authority on\r\nsomething from above, the purely personal conception of politics with\r\nthe corruption incident upon the idea that members of clans must take\r\ncare of each other--which formerly was a virtue--all were the sources\r\nof the outstanding difficulties that jutted everywhere into the plans\r\nfor a more highly and efficiently organized commonwealth. But it was\r\na pleasure to see the growing manifestation of a commonwealth spirit,\r\nthe organization of public opinion, and the clearer vision of the\r\ndemands of public service. Even among the officials the idea that the\r\nGovernment was merely a taxing and office-holding organization was\r\ngiving way, especially among the younger men, to a desire that the\r\nfunctions of government should be used for developmental purposes, in\r\nhelping the people towards better methods in agriculture and industry,\r\nin encouraging improved communications and public works of many kinds.\r\n\r\nInternational action as seen from Peking during this period did not\r\nhave many reassuring qualities. In most cases it was based upon a\r\ndesire to lose no technical advantage of position; to yield not a whit,\r\nno matter what general benefit might result through mutual concessions.\r\nEach one was jealously guarding his position in which he had advanced\r\nstep by step. Some were willing to make common cause with others in\r\nthings that would not always commend themselves to a sense of equity,\r\nin order that they might take still another step forward. During the\r\nmajor part of this period one power employed every device of intrigue,\r\nintimidation, corruption, and force in order to gain a position for\r\nitself in flagrant disregard of the rights of the Chinese people\r\nitself, and in oblivion of the rights of others.\r\n\r\nAs to American policy, the difficulties which I encountered arose from\r\nthe fact that a great deal was expected of a country so powerful, which\r\nhad declared and always pursued a policy so just to China. Chinese\r\ngoodwill and confidence, and the real friendship of the Chinese people\r\ntoward America certainly tended to make easier any task America might\r\nbe ready to undertake. But America had no political aims and desired to\r\nabstain particularly from anything verging on political interference,\r\neven in behalf of those principles we so thoroughly believe in.\r\nAmerican relationships to China depended not on governmental action,\r\nbut on a spontaneous coöperation between the two peoples in matters of\r\neducation, commerce, and industry.\r\n\r\nInfinitely complex as were the questions of Chinese internal affairs\r\nand of the privileges and desires of the various powers, yet to my mind\r\nit was not a difficult problem to see what should be done in order\r\nto put matters on a sound foundation. I had learned to have great\r\nconfidence in the ability of the Chinese to manage their own affairs\r\nwhen let alone, particularly in commerce and industry.\r\n\r\nThat was the first desideratum, to secure for them immunity from\r\nthe constant interference, open and secret, on the part of foreign\r\ninterests desirous of confusing Chinese affairs and drawing advantage\r\nfrom such confusion. So far as American diplomatic action was\r\nconcerned, its essential task was to prevent such interference, and\r\nto see to it that China could not be closed even by those indirect\r\nmethods which often accompany the most vociferous, ardent declarations\r\nin favour of Chinese independence and sovereignty. We therefore had\r\nto keep a close watch and to resist in specific detail any and all of\r\nthose innumerable efforts on the part of others to secure and fortify\r\na position of privilege. That was the negative side of our action. The\r\npositive side, however, was entirely non-political. Americans sought\r\nno position of tutordom or control. Only upon the free and spontaneous\r\ninvitation of the Chinese would they come to counsel and assist.\r\n\r\nThe important thing was that Americans should continue to take a\r\nhand in the education of China and the upbuilding of Chinese business\r\nand enterprise. They had done this in the past, and would do it in\r\nthe future in the spirit of free coöperation, without desire to\r\nexercise a tutelage over others, always rejoicing in any progress the\r\nChinese themselves made. Such activities must continue and increase.\r\nSound action in business and constructive work in industry should be\r\nAmerica's contribution to the solution of the specific difficulties of\r\nChina. The Chinese people were discouraged, confused, disillusioned;\r\nbut every centre, no matter how small, from which radiate sound\r\ninfluences in education and business, is a source of strength and\r\nprogress. If Americans could be stopped from doing these things, or\r\nimpeded and obstructed in them, then there would nothing further\r\nremain worth while for Americans to do. But if they could organize\r\nenterprises, great and small, they would in the most direct and\r\neffective manner give the encouragement and organizing impulse which\r\nChina needed so urgently. So the simple principle of American action\r\nin China is this: By doing things in themselves worth while, Americans\r\nwill contribute most to the true liberation of the Chinese people.\r\n\r\nNever has one nation had a greater opportunity to act as counsellor and\r\nfriend to another and to help a vast and lovable people to realize its\r\nstriving for a better life. Coöperation freely sought, unconstrained,\r\nspontaneous desire to model on institutions and methods which are\r\nadmired--that is the only way in which nations may mutually influence\r\neach other without the coercion of political power and the cunning of\r\nintrigue. That is a feeling which has existed in the hearts of the\r\nChinese toward America. The American people does not yet realize what a\r\ntreasure it possesses in this confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART I\r\n\r\n  OLD CHINA AND THE\r\n  NEW REPUBLIC\r\n\r\nAN AMERICAN DIPLOMAT IN CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE DICTATOR-PRESIDENT OF CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My opponents are disloyal. They would pull down my government.\" He who\r\nspoke was cordial in his manner as he thus off handedly epitomized his\r\ntheory of government.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai, President of the Chinese Republic, was short of stature\r\nand thickset; but his expressive face, his quick gestures, his powerful\r\nneck and bullet head, gave him the appearance of great energy. His\r\neyes, which were fine and clear, alive with interest and mobile, were\r\nalways brightly alert. They fixed themselves on the visitor with keen\r\npenetration, yet never seemed hostile; they were full always of keen\r\ninterest. These eyes of his revealed how readily he followed--or\r\nusually anticipated--the trend of the conversation, though he listened\r\nwith close attention, seemingly bringing his judgment to bear on each\r\nnew detail. Frenchmen saw in him a resemblance to Clemenceau; and this\r\nis born out by his portrait which appears on the Chinese dollar. In\r\nstature, facial expression, shape of head, contour of features as well\r\nas in the manner of wearing his moustache, he did greatly resemble the\r\nTiger.\r\n\r\nI had noted these things when I was first presented to the President,\r\nand I had felt also the almost ruthless power of the man. Republican\r\nin title he was, but an autocrat at heart. All the old glittering\r\ntrappings of the empire he had preserved. Even the Chief of the\r\nMilitary Department of the President's household, General Yin Chang,\r\nwhom Yuan had sent to fetch me in Imperial splendour, is a Manchu and\r\nformer Imperial commander. His one foreign language significantly\r\nenough was German which he acquired when he was minister in Berlin. I\r\nhad passed between files of the huge guardsmen of Yuan Shih-kai, who\r\nhad Frederick the Great's fondness for tall men; and I found him in the\r\nshowy palace of the great Empress Dowager, standing in the main throne\r\nhall to receive me. He was flanked by thirty generals of his household,\r\nextended in wings at both sides of him, and their uniforms made it a\r\nmost impressive scene.\r\n\r\nBut that was an occasion of state. Later, at a more informal interview,\r\naccompanied only by Mr. Williams, secretary of the legation and Mr.\r\nPeck, the Chinese secretary, observed Yuan's character more fully.\r\nHe had just expelled from parliament the democratic party (Kuo Min\r\nTang); then he had summarily dismissed the Parliament itself. Feeling,\r\nperhaps, a possible loss of American goodwill he had sent for me to\r\nexplain his action.\r\n\r\n\"It was not a good parliament, for it was made up largely of\r\ninexperienced theorists and young politicians,\" he began. \"They wished\r\nto meddle with the Government as well as to legislate on all matters.\r\nTheir real function was to adopt a permanent constitution for the\r\nRepublic, but they made no headway with that.\" And with much truth he\r\nadded: \"Our traditions are very different from your Western ones and\r\nour affairs are very complex. We cannot safely apply your abstract\r\nideas of policy.\"\r\n\r\nOf his own work of stirring up, through emissaries, internal and\r\npartisan controversies which prevented the new parliament from\r\neffectively organizing, Yuan of course omitted to speak. Moreover,\r\nhe said little of the possibility of more closely coördinating the\r\nexecutive and the legislative branches; so while he avowed his desire\r\nto have a constitution forthwith, and to reconstitute Parliament by\r\nmore careful selections under a new electoral law, I found myself\r\nthinking of his own career. His personal rule, his unscrupulous\r\nadvancement to power, with the incidental corruption and cold-blooded\r\nexecutions that marked it, and his bitter personal feeling against all\r\npolitical opponents--these were not qualities that make for stable\r\nparliamentary government, which depends on allowing other people\r\nfrankly to advocate their opinions in the effort to gain adherents\r\nenough to succeed in turn to political power. The failure to understand\r\nthis basic principle of democracy is the vice of Chinese politics.\r\n\r\n\"As you see,\" Yuan beamed eagerly, \"the Chinese Republic is a very\r\nyoung baby. It must be nursed and kept from taking strong meat or\r\npotent medicines like those prescribed by foreign doctors.\" This\r\nmetaphor he repeated with relish, his eyes sparkling as they sought\r\nmine and those of the other listeners to get their expressions of\r\nassent or reserve.\r\n\r\nA young baby indeed and childishly cared for! Here, for example, is a\r\ndecree published by Yuan Shih-kai on March 8, 1915. It indicates how\r\nfaith in his republicanism was penetrating to remote regions, and how\r\nsuch faith was rewarded by him:\r\n\r\n\"Ihsihaishun, Prince of the Koersin Banner, reported through the Board\r\nfor Mongolia and Tibet that Kuanchuk-chuaimupal, Hutukhtu of the\r\nBanner, has led his followers to support the cause of the Republic and\r\nrequested that the said Hutukhtu be rewarded for his good sentiments.\r\nThe said Hutukhtu led his followers and vowed allegiance to the\r\nRepublic, which action shows that he clearly understands the good\r\ncause. He is hereby allowed to ride in a yellow canopied carriage to\r\nshow our appreciation.\"\r\n\r\nThis rather naïve emphasis on externals and on display is born of the\r\nold imperialism, a more significant feature of Chinese political life\r\nthan it may seem. It colours most of the public ceremonies in China.\r\nThe state carriage which the President had sent to convey me to his\r\nofficial residence in the Imperial City for the presentation of my\r\ncredentials, on November 17th, was highly ornate, enamelled in blue\r\nwith gold decorations. It was drawn by eight horses, with a cavalry\r\nescort sent by the President and my own guard of mounted marines; the\r\nlegation staff of secretaries and attachés accompanied me in other\r\ncarriages.\r\n\r\nThus in an old Imperial barouche and with an ex-Imperial military\r\nofficer, General Yin, at my side, I rolled on toward the abode of the\r\nrepublican chief magistrate. We alighted at the monumental gate of an\r\nenclosure that surrounds the lovely South Lake in the western part of\r\nthe Imperial City. On an island within this lake arose, tier above\r\ntier, and roofed with bright tiles of blue and yellow, the palace\r\nassigned by the Empress Dowager to Emperor Kwang Hsu; for long years,\r\nuntil death took him, it was his abode in semi-captivity. This palace\r\nwas now the home of President Yuan.\r\n\r\nThe remote origin of its buildings, their exquisite forms and brilliant\r\ncolouring, as contrasted with the sombreness of the lake at that\r\nseason, and the stirring events of which they have been the scene,\r\ncannot fail to impress the visitor as he slowly glides across the\r\nImperial lake in the old-fashioned boat, with its formal little cabin,\r\ncurtained and upholstered, and with its lateral planks, up and down\r\nwhich pass the men who propel the boat with long poles.\r\n\r\nArrived at the palace, everything recalled the colourful court life\r\nso recently departed. I was greeted by the master of ceremonies, Mr.\r\nLu Cheng-hsiang, and his associate, Mr. Alfred Sze, later Chinese\r\nminister at London and Washington. The former soon after became\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, while Mr. Sze was originally sent as\r\nminister to England. These gentlemen escorted me through a series of\r\ncourts and halls, all spacious and impressive, until we reached the\r\nold Imperial library, a very jewel of architecture in this remarkable\r\nEastern world of beauty. The library faces on a clear and deep pool\r\nround which are grouped the court theatre and various throne rooms\r\nand festival halls; all quiet and secluded--a charming place for\r\ndistinguished entertainments. The rustle of heavy silks, the play of\r\niridescent colour, the echoes of song and lute from the theatre--all\r\nthat exquisite oriental refinement still seems to linger.\r\n\r\nThe library itself is the choicest of all these apartments. The perfect\r\nsense of proportion expressed in the architecture, the quiet reserve\r\nin all its decorations, the living literary reminiscence in the verses\r\nwritten on the paper panels by the Imperial hand, all testify to a most\r\nfastidious taste.\r\n\r\nHere we rested for a few minutes while word was carried to the\r\nPresident, who was to receive my credentials. Then followed our walk\r\nbetween the files of the huge guardsmen, our entrance to the large\r\naudience chamber in the pretentious modern structure erected by the\r\nEmpress Dowager, and the presentation to Yuan Shih-kai, as he stood in\r\nthe centre, flanked by his generals.\r\n\r\nI was formally presented to the President by Mr. Sun Pao-chi, Minister\r\nof Foreign Affairs; and Dr. Wellington Koo translated my brief address\r\nand the President's reply.\r\n\r\nA military dictatorship had succeeded the old imperialism, that was\r\nall. Yuan had made his reputation and gained his power as a military\r\ncommander. Yet there was about him nothing of the adventurer, nor any\r\nsuggestion of the field of battle. He seemed now to be an administrator\r\nrather than a military captain. Certainly he had won power through\r\ninfinite patience, great knowledge of men, political insight, and,\r\nabove all, through playing always a safe if unscrupulous game.\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by governing in a republic he could not know. Without\r\nhigh literary culture, although with a mind trained and well informed,\r\nhe had not seen foreign countries, nor had he any knowledge of foreign\r\nlanguages. Therefore, he could have only a remote and vague notion of\r\nthe foreign institutions which China at this time was beginning to\r\nimitate. He had no real knowledge or conception of the commonwealth\r\nprinciple of government, nor of the true use and function of a\r\nparliament, and particularly of a parliamentary opposition. He merely\r\naccepted these as necessary evils to be held within as narrow limits as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nDuring the two and a half years from my coming to Peking until the\r\ntime of his death, Yuan Shih-kai left the enclosure of his palace only\r\ntwice. This reminds me of the American, with an introduction from the\r\nState Department, who wired me from Shanghai asking me to arrange for\r\nhim to take a moving picture of Yuan \"proceeding from his White House\r\nto his Capitol.\" This enterprising Yankee would have had plenty of\r\ntime to meditate on the difference between oriental political customs\r\nand our own if he had waited for Yuan Shih-kai to \"proceed\" from his\r\npolitical hermitage. The President's seclusion was usually attributed\r\nto fear of assassination, but if such fear was present in his mind, as\r\nwell it might have been, there was undoubtedly also the idea, taken\r\nover from the Empire, that the holder of the highest political power\r\nshould not appear in public except on very unusual occasions.\r\n\r\nWhen he received me informally, he doffed the uniform of state and\r\nalways wore a long Chinese coat. He had retained the distinction and\r\nrefinement of Chinese manners, with a few additions from the West, such\r\nas shaking hands. His cue he had abandoned in 1912, when he decided\r\nto become President of the Republic. In the building which is now the\r\nForeign Office and where he was then residing, Yuan asked Admiral Tsai\r\nTing-kan whether his entry into the new era should not be outwardly\r\nexpressed by shedding the traditional adornment of the head which\r\nthough once a sign of bondage had become an emblem of nationality.\r\nWhen Admiral Tsai advised strongly in favour of it, Yuan sent for a big\r\npair of scissors, and said to him: \"It is your advice. You carry it\r\nout.\" The Admiral, with a vigorous clip, transformed Yuan into a modern\r\nman.\r\n\r\nBut inwardly Yuan Shih-kai was not much changed thereby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCHINA OF MANY PERSONS\r\n\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai, a ruler whose power was personal, whose theories of\r\ngovernment were those of an absolute monarch, who believed that\r\nin himself lay the hope of his people; China itself a nation of\r\nindividualists, among whom there was as yet no unifying national sense,\r\nno inbred love of country, no traditions of personal responsibility\r\ntoward their government, no sense that they themselves shared in the\r\nmaking of the laws which ordered their lives--these, I think, were the\r\nfirst clear impressions I had of the land to which I came as envoy in\r\nthe early days of the Republic.\r\n\r\nEven the rivers and cities through which we passed on our way to Peking\r\nseemed to deepen this feeling for me. The houseboats jammed together in\r\nthe harbour at Shanghai visualized it. Each of these boats sheltered\r\na family, who lived and moved and had their being, for the most part,\r\non its narrow decks. Each family was quite independent of the people\r\non the next boat. Each was immersed in the stern business of earning\r\nbread. These houseboat people (so it seemed) had little in common with\r\neach other, little in common with the life of the cities and villages\r\nwhich they regularly visited. As a class they lived apart; and each\r\nfamily was, for most of the time, isolated from the others. Their\r\nlife, I thought, was the civilization of China in miniature. Of course\r\nsuch a figure applies only roughly. I mean merely to suggest that the\r\npopulation of this vast country is not a homogeneous one in a political\r\nsense. The unit of society is--as it has been for many centuries--the\r\nfamily, not the state. This is changing now, and changing rapidly.\r\nThe seeds of democracy found fertile soil in China; but a civilization\r\nwhich has been shaping itself through eighty centuries cannot be too\r\nabruptly attacked. China is, after all, an ancient monarchy upon which\r\nthe republican form of government was rather suddenly imposed. It is\r\nstill in the period of adjustment. Such at least were my reactions as\r\nwe ascended the Hwang-pu River, on that October day in 1913, and drew\r\ninto the harbour basin which lies at the centre of Shanghai.\r\n\r\nIn one of the hotels of the city we found the \"Saturday Lunch Club\" in\r\nsession. I was not a little surprised that this mid-day gastronomic\r\nforum, which had but lately come into vogue in America, had become\r\nso thoroughly acclimated in this distant port. But despite the many\r\nnationalities represented at this international gathering, the language\r\nwas English. As to dress, many of the Chinese at the luncheon preferred\r\ntheir dignified, long-flowing robes to Western coats and trousers.\r\n\r\nDr. Wu Ting-fang was present in Chinese costume and a little purple\r\nskull cap, and we sat down to talk together. He related the moves\r\nmade by President Yuan against the democratic party (Kuo Min Tang)\r\nin parliament and said: \"Yuan Shih-kai's sole aim is to get rid of\r\nparliament. He has no conception of free government, is entirely a man\r\nof personal authority. The air of absolutism surrounds him. Beware,\"\r\nDr. Wu admonished, \"when you get behind those high walls of Peking.\r\nThe atmosphere is stagnant. It seems to overcome men and make them\r\nreactionary. Nobody seems to resist that power!\"\r\n\r\nLater I was accosted on a momentous matter by an American missionary.\r\nHe was not affiliated with any missionary society, but had organized\r\na so-called International Institute for a Mission among the Higher\r\nClasses. His mien betrayed overburdening care, ominous presentiment,\r\nand he said he had already submitted a grave matter to the Department\r\nof State. It concerned the Saturday Lunch Club. Somewhat too\r\nprecipitately I spoke with gratification of its apparent success. \"But,\r\nsir,\" he interposed, \"it was established and set in motion by the\r\nconsul-general!\"\r\n\r\nAs still I could not see wherein the difficulty lay, my visitor became\r\nemphatic.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not realize, sir, that my institute was established to bring\r\nthe different nationalities together, and that the formation of such a\r\nclub should have been left to me?\"\r\n\r\nWhen I expressed my feeling that there was no end of work to be done\r\nin the world in establishing relationships of goodwill; that every\r\naccomplishment of this kind was to be received with gratitude, he\r\ngave me up. I had thought, at first, that he was about to charge the\r\nconsul-general, at the very least, with embezzlement.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon I inspected the student battalion of St. John's\r\nUniversity. This institution is modern, affiliated with the\r\nEpiscopalian Church, and many of its alumni are distinguished in public\r\nlife as well as in industrial enterprise and commerce. Of these I need\r\nonly mention Dr. W.W. Yen, Dr. Wellington Koo, Dr. Alfred Sze, and\r\nDr. Wang Chung-hui, later Chief Justice of China. Dr. Hawks Pott, the\r\npresident, introduced me to the assembled students as an old friend\r\nof China. There I met Dr. Pott's wife, a Chinese lady, and several of\r\ntheir daughters and sons, two of whom later fought in the Great War.\r\n\r\nA newspaper reporter brought me back abruptly to local matters. He\r\nwas the first to interview me in China. \"Will you remove the American\r\nmarines,\" he queried, \"from the Chienmen Tower?\"\r\n\r\nA disturbing question! I was cautious, as I had not even known there\r\nwere marines posted on that ancient tower. Whether they ought to\r\nbe kept there was a matter to look into, along with other things\r\naffecting the destiny of nations.\r\n\r\nI could not stop to see Shanghai then, but did so later. If one looks\r\ndeeply enough its excellences stand out. The private gardens, behind\r\nhigh walls, show its charm; acres covered with glorious plants, shrubs,\r\nand bushes; rows and groves of springtime trees radiant with blossoms;\r\nthe parks and the verandas of clubs where people resort of late\r\nafternoons to take their tea; the glitter of Nanking Road at night, its\r\nsurge of humanity, the swarming life on river and creeks. This is the\r\nreal Shanghai, market and meeting place of the nations.\r\n\r\nNanking came next, visited the 4th of November. Forlorn and woeful the\r\nold capital lay in gray morning light as we entered. The semi-barbarous\r\ntroops of Chang Hsun lined its streets. They had sacked the town,\r\nostensibly suppressing the last vestiges of the \"Revolution.\" General\r\nChang Hsun, an old imperialist, still clinging to ancient customs, had\r\nespoused the cause of President Yuan. A rough soldier quite innocent\r\nof modernity, he had taken Nanking, not really for the republican\r\ngovernment, but for immediate advantage to himself, and for his\r\nsoldiers to loot and burn. There they stood, huge, black-uniformed,\r\npig-tailed men, \"guarding\" the streets along which the native dwellers\r\nwere slinking sullenly and in fear. Everywhere charred walls without\r\nroofs; the contents of houses broken and cast on the street; fragments\r\nof shrapnel in the walls--withal a depressing picture of misery.\r\n\r\nNanking, immense and primitive, had reverted partly to agriculture, and\r\nfor miles the houses of farmers line extensive fields. Three Japanese\r\nmen-of-war rode at anchor in mid-river; they had come to support the\r\nrepresentations of the Japanese consul over an injury suffered by a\r\nJapanese barber during the disturbances. General Chang Hsun, forced to\r\noffer reparation, had among other things to call ceremoniously on the\r\nJapanese consul to express his formal regrets. This he did, saving his\r\nface by arranging to call on all the foreign consuls the same day.\r\n\r\nAnother bit of local colour: We were driven to the American consulate,\r\nmodestly placed on the edge of the agricultural region of Nanking, with\r\nbarns in the offing. The consul being absent on leave, the official in\r\ncharge greeted us. His wife related that a few days before thirty of\r\nChang's braves, armed to the teeth, had come to the house to see what\r\nthey might carry off. In her husband's absence Mrs. Gilbert met them\r\nat the door and very quietly talked the matter over with them as to\r\nwhat unending bother it would occasion everybody, particularly General\r\nChang, if his men should invade the American consulate, and how it\r\nwould be far better to think it over while she prepared some tea for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe men, at first fierce and unrelenting, looked at one another\r\npuzzled, then found seats along the edge of the veranda. When the tea\r\ncame in, their spokesman said they recognized that theirs had been a\r\nfoolish enterprise. With expressions of civility and gratitude they\r\nconsumed their tea and went away--which shows what one American woman\r\ncan do in stilling the savage breast of a Chinese vandal by a quiet\r\nword of reason.\r\n\r\nAfter the exhibition his men had made of themselves in Nanking, I had\r\nno wish to call on His Excellency Chang Hsun. We arranged to take the\r\nfirst train for Tientsin. Crossing the broad river by ferry, from its\r\ndeck friends pointed out Tiger Head and other famous landscapes, the\r\nscenes of recent fighting and of clashes during the Revolution of\r\n1911. In the sitting room of our special car on the Pukow railway, the\r\nlittle company comprised Dr. Stanley K. Hornbeck, who went on with me\r\nto Peking; Mr. Roy S. Anderson, an American uniquely informed about\r\nthe Chinese, and a Chinese governmental representative who accompanied\r\nme. In a single afternoon Mr. Anderson gave me a complete view of\r\nthe existing situation in Chinese politics, relating many personal\r\nincidents and characteristics.\r\n\r\nIn Chinese politics the personal element is supreme. The key to the\r\nramifications of political influence lies in knowledge of persons;\r\ntheir past history, affiliations and interests, friendships, enmities,\r\nfinancial standing, their groupings and the interactions of the various\r\ngroups. Intensely human, there is little of the abstract in Chinese\r\nsocial ethics. Their ideals of conduct are personal, while the remoter\r\nloyalties to principle or patriotic duty are not strongly expressed\r\nin action. In this immediate social cement is the strength by which\r\nChinese society has been able to exist for ages.\r\n\r\nThe defect of this great quality is in the absence of any motive\r\nwhereby men may be carried beyond their narrower interests in\r\ndefinitely conceived, broad public aims. When I came to China these\r\nolder methods prevailed more than at present; hence Mr. Anderson's\r\nknowledge of the Chinese, wide as the nation and specific as to the\r\nqualities of all its important men, enabled me to approach Chinese\r\naffairs concretely, personally, and to lay aside for the time any\r\ngeneral and preconceived notions. It enabled me to see, also, how\r\nmatters of such vast consequence, as, for example, the Hwai River\r\nfamines, had been neglected for the short-sighted individual concerns\r\nof Chinese politics.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon we passed through the Hwai River region. An apparently\r\nendless alluvial plain, it is inexhaustibly rich in depth and quality\r\nof soil--_loess_, which has been carried down from the mountains and\r\ndeposited here for eons. Fitted by Nature to be one of the most fertile\r\ngarden spots on earth, Nature herself has spoiled it. The rivers,\r\nswollen by torrential rains in the highlands, flood this great area\r\nperiodically, destroying all crops; for many years only two harvests\r\nhave been gathered out of a possible six, in some years there have been\r\nnone at all.\r\n\r\nHere the visitations of famine and plague are immemorial. The liberal\r\nand effective assistance which the American Red Cross gave during\r\nthe last famine, in 1911, is gratefully remembered by the Chinese.\r\nBeholding this region, so richly provided and lacking only a moderate,\r\nsystematic expenditure for engineering works to make it the source of\r\nassured livelihood for at least twenty millions more than its present\r\npopulation, I resolved that one of my first efforts would be to help\r\nreclaim the vast estate.\r\n\r\nWe arrived after dark in the province of Shantung--Shantung, which\r\nwas destined to play so large a part in my official life in China!\r\nThe crowds at stations were growing enormous, their greetings more\r\nvociferous. An old friend appeared, Tsai Chu-tung, emissary of the\r\nProvincial Governor and of the Commissioner of Foreign Affairs; he\r\nhad been a student under me, and, for a time, my Chinese secretary.\r\nPast the stations with their military bands and metallic welcomes\r\nand deputations appearing with cards, at all hours of the night, we\r\narrived at length at Tsinan, Shantung's capital. Here, in behalf of\r\nthe Governor, the young Commissioner Tsai, together with an official\r\ndeputation, formally greeted me; thence he accompanied me to Peking,\r\naffording me another chance to hear from a very keen and highly trained\r\nman an account of China's situation.\r\n\r\nReaching Tientsin that afternoon, we were met by representatives of the\r\nCivil Governor and by his band. There the American community, it seems,\r\nhad been stirred prematurely by news of my coming, and had visited\r\nthe station for two days in succession. The manager of the railway, a\r\nBritisher, had confused the Consul-General by his error in date of my\r\narrival, starting too soon the entire machinery of reception, including\r\na parade by the Fifteenth United States Infantry.\r\n\r\nWe had dinner that evening with Civil Governor Liu at his palace. Miles\r\nof driving in rain through dark, narrow streets, ending with a vision\r\nof huge walls and lantern-illuminated gates, found us in the inner\r\ncourts, and, finally, in the main hall of the antique, many-coloured\r\nstructure where the fat and friendly Governor received us. The heads\r\nof the various provincial departments attended, together with the\r\nPresident of the Assembly and the military aides. Young Mr. Li, the\r\nGovernor's secretary and interpreter for the after-dinner speechmakers,\r\nperformed the rare feat of rendering into either language an entire\r\nspeech at a time--and the speeches were not short. My Chinese secretary\r\ncommented on his brilliant translations, the perfect renderings of\r\nthe English into Chinese, and I could myself admire his mastery of\r\nthe English idiom. Such talent of translation is seldom displayed;\r\nthe discourse of speakers is usually limited to brief paragraphs,\r\ncontinually checked by the renderings of the interpreters. Of course,\r\nthis interrupts the flow of thought and contact with one's hearers.\r\nBut the interpreter at this dinner even managed to translate jokes\r\nand witticisms without losing the point. A play on words is most\r\ndifficult to carry into a foreign tongue, but the Chinese is so full\r\nof opportunities for puns that a nimble interpreter will always find a\r\nsubstitute. To the telling of a really funny situation the Chinese can\r\nbe relied on to respond. Their humour is not unlike the American, which\r\ndelights particularly in exposing undue pretensions. Interpreters, in\r\ntranslating speeches to the general public, have sometimes resorted\r\nto something of their own invention, in order to produce the expected\r\nlaugh. When they despair of making the foreign joke hit the bull's-eye,\r\nthey occasionally help things along by making personal remarks about\r\nthe speaker, whose gratifications at the hilarity produced is usually\r\nunclouded by a knowledge of the method employed.\r\n\r\nOur departure from Tientsin was signalized by an unusual mark of\r\nChinese governmental courtesy. For the trip to Peking we found assigned\r\nthe palace car of the former Empress Dowager, and I was told that it\r\nhad not been used since her reign came to an end. Adapting a new\r\ninvention to old custom, the car's interior had been arranged as a\r\nlittle palace chamber. The entrance doors were in a double set. Those\r\nin the centre were to be opened only when the sovereign entered or\r\ndeparted, the side doors being for ordinary use. Opposite the central\r\ndoors at the end of the salon stood a little throne, high and wide,\r\nupholstered in Imperial yellow. The draperies and upholsteries of the\r\ncar were all of that colour, and it made, in its way, quite a showing\r\nof splendour and departed greatness.\r\n\r\nAs one approaches the capital city, the beautiful mountain forms of\r\nthe so-called Western Hills, which rise suddenly out of the plain\r\nabout ten miles beyond Peking and attain an altitude of from six to\r\nseven thousand feet, present a striking contrast to the flat and\r\nfar-stretching Chihli plain. The towers and city walls of Peking, an\r\nimpressive and astounding apparition of strength and permanence, befit\r\nthis scene. Solemn and mysterious, memorable for their size, extent,\r\nand general inevitableness of structure, they can be compared only with\r\nthe Pyramids, or with great mountains fashioned by the hand of Nature\r\nherself. Looking down upon these plains, where so many races have\r\nmet, fought, worked, lived, and died, where there is one of the chief\r\nmeeting points of racial currents, these walls are in themselves the\r\nsymbols of a memorable and long-sustained civilization.\r\n\r\nAs we approach more closely, the walls tower immediately above us as\r\nthe train skirts them for several miles, crosses a number of busy roads\r\nleading to the southern gates of the city, and then suddenly slips\r\nthrough an opening in the walls to the inside. We first pass through\r\nthe so-called Chinese city; this particular corner is no longer densely\r\npopulated, but is now left to gardens, fields, and burial places with\r\ntheir monuments and pagodas. We only skirt the populous part of the\r\nChinese city. Soon we are brought immediately under the lofty walls\r\nwhich separate the Chinese from the Manchu city, adjacent to it on\r\nthe north, but separated from it by an enormous wall one hundred feet\r\nhigh, with a diameter of eighty feet. Where the two encircling walls\r\nmeet, towering bastions soar upward, and above the roadways rise high\r\ngate-houses of many stories. The impassivity of these monumental\r\nstructures contrasts sharply with the swarming human life that surges\r\nin the streets below.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Willys R. Peck, Chinese Secretary of the Legation, who had\r\nmet us at Tientsin and accompanied us to Peking, I learned more about\r\nthe recent events in the capital and the fight which Yuan Shih-Kai\r\nwas waging against the Parliament. At the station we were greeted by\r\na large concourse of civilian and military officials, and Mr. E.T.\r\nWilliams, Chargé d'Affaires since Mr. Calhoun's departure, acted as\r\nintroducer. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sun Pao-chi, a tall,\r\nbenevolent-looking man, wearing European dress and long chin whiskers,\r\nand speaking a little English with more French and German, offered\r\nhis welcome and felicitations. Other high officials were there, many\r\nmembers of the American community, and several representatives of\r\nthe parliament. It was a delight to see the fine-looking companies\r\nof American marines, who among all troops in Peking are noted for\r\ntheir well-groomed, smart, and soldierly appearance. Included for the\r\nofficial welcome was a company of stalwart Chinese infantry, and one\r\nof the Peking gendarmerie, which also is military in its organization.\r\nThe several bands vied with each other in playing national airs and\r\nsalutes, while thousands of spectators congregated.\r\n\r\nThe central Tartar city gate (the Chienmen), was still in its original\r\nform, and in passing through or under it one received an indelible\r\nimpression of the stupendous majesty and dignity which characterize\r\nthis unique capital. The curtain walls connecting the inner and outer\r\ngates have since been removed. We drove through a side gate in the\r\ncurtain wall, finding ourselves in an impressive plaza overtowered by\r\nthe two lofty and beautiful gate-houses. Two small picturesque antique\r\ntemples flank the main entrance; one, dedicated to the God of War, was\r\na favourite place with the Empress Dowager, who stopped her cortège\r\nthere whenever she passed. From the flag-poles of these temples huge,\r\nbrilliantly coloured banners floated in the air. Atop the wall from\r\nwhich the Chienmen Tower arises were American marines on guard and\r\nlooking down upon us. These, then, were the men whose presence up there\r\nseemed to be interesting people so much.\r\n\r\nFrom the main gateway one looks straight up the avenue which forms the\r\ncentral axis of Peking; it leads through many ornamental gates and\r\nbetween stately buildings to the central throne halls of the Imperial\r\nPalace. The city plan of Peking is a symmetrical one. This central\r\naxis, running due north and south, passes through a succession of\r\nimportant gateways, monuments, and seats of power. From it the city\r\nexpands regularly east and west; on the south the Chinese city, the\r\nsymmetry of its streets and alleyways more broken; and the Manchu city\r\non the north, with broad avenues leading to the principal gates, while\r\nthe large blocks between them are cut up more regularly by narrower\r\nstreets and alleyways.\r\n\r\nFrom the main south gate of the Chinese city the central line passes\r\nalong the principal business street to the central south gate of the\r\nTartar city--the imposing Chienmen--while eighty rods beyond this\r\nstands the first outer gate of the Imperial City. Thence the central\r\nline cuts the large square which lies immediately outside of the\r\nForbidden City, forming the main approach to the Imperial City. The\r\nline then passes between pillars and huge stone lions through the\r\nForbidden City's first gate, cutting its inner parade ground and inner\r\ngate, above which stands the throne from which the Emperor reviewed\r\nhis troops. Through the central enclosures, with the throne rooms\r\nand coronation halls, three magnificent structures in succession,\r\nthe line passes, at the point where the thrones stand, into the\r\nresidential portion of the Forbidden City where the present Emperor\r\nlives, and strikes the summit of Coal Hill, the highest point in\r\nPeking. It bisects the temple where the dead bodies of Emperors reposed\r\nbefore burial, and proceeds from the rear of the Imperial City by\r\nits north gate through the ancient Bell Tower and Drum Tower. A more\r\nawe-inspiring and majestic approach to a seat of power is not to be\r\nseen in this world. We can well imagine, when tribute bearers came to\r\nPeking and passed along this highway beset with imposing structures and\r\ngreat monuments, that they were prepared to pay homage when finally\r\nin the presence of the being to whose might all this was but an\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\nBut we did not follow along this path of sovereign power. After passing\r\nthrough the Chienmen we turned directly to the right to enter the\r\nLegation Quarter and to reach the American Legation, which nestles\r\nimmediately inside the Tartar wall in the shadow of the tall and\r\nimposing Chienmen Tower. It is the first of the great establishments\r\nalong Legation Street, which is approached through a beautiful\r\nmany-coloured pailu, or street arch.\r\n\r\nNo other American representative abroad has quite so easy a time\r\nupon arrival at his post. We were going to a home prepared for\r\nour reception, adequately furnished, and with a complete staff of\r\nservants and attendants who were ready to serve luncheon immediately,\r\nif required. In most cases, unfortunately, an American diplomatic\r\nrepresentative will for weeks or months have no place to lay his head\r\nexcept in a hotel. Many American ministers and ambassadors have spent\r\nfully one half the time during their first year of office in making\r\nthose necessary living arrangements which I found entirely complete at\r\nPeking. That is the crucial period, too, when their minds should be\r\nfree for observing the situation in which they are to do their work.\r\nMay the time soon come when the nation realizes more fully the need of\r\ndignified representation of its interests abroad.\r\n\r\nThe residence of the minister I found simple but handsome, in stately\r\ncolonial renaissance style, its interior admirably combining the\r\nspaciousness needed for official entertaining with the repose of a\r\nreal home. It is made of imported American materials, and a government\r\narchitect was expressly sent to put up the legation buildings. He had\r\nbeen designing government structures in America, and the somewhat\r\nstereotyped chancery and houses of the secretaries were popularly\r\ncalled \"the young post offices.\" But the minister's house, largely\r\ndue to the efforts of Mr. Rockhill, who was minister at the time, is\r\na masterpiece of appropriateness--all but the chimneys. It is related\r\nthat the architect, being unfamiliar with the ways of Chinese labourers\r\nand frequently impatient with them, incurred their ill-will. When\r\nMr. Rockhill first occupied the residence, it was found the chimneys\r\nwould not draw; the disgruntled masons had quietly walled them up, in\r\norder that the architect might \"lose face,\" and the chimney from the\r\nfireplace of the large dining room was so thoroughly blockaded that it\r\nremained permanently out of commission.\r\n\r\nAt a distance from the \"compound,\" or enclosure, which surrounds the\r\nminister's residence, fronting on a central plaza, there is a veritable\r\nhamlet of additional houses occupied by secretaries, attachés, consular\r\nstudents, and the clerical staff. It is a picturesque Chinese village,\r\nwith an antique temple and many separate houses, each with its garden\r\nenclosed within high walls--a rescued bit of ancient China in the midst\r\nof the European monotony of the Legation Quarter. It adjoins the Jade\r\nCanal, opposite the hotel called \"Sleeping Cars\" by some unimaginative\r\ndirector, but more fitly known as the Hotel of the Four Nations. At the\r\nWater Gate, where the Jade Canal passes under the Tartar wall, is the\r\nvery point where the American marines first penetrated into the Tartar\r\ncity in 1900.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are remarkably free from self-consciousness, and therefore\r\nare good actors; as one sees the thousands passing back and forth on\r\nthe streets, one feels that they, too, are all acting. Here are not\r\nthe headlong rush and elbowing scramble of the crowded streets of a\r\nWestern metropolis. All walk and ride with dignity, as if conscious of\r\na certain importance, representing in themselves not the eager purpose\r\npresently to get to a certain place, but rather a leisurely flow of\r\nexistence, carrying traditions and memories of centuries in which\r\nthe present enterprise is but a minor incident. Foreign women have\r\nsometimes been terrified by these vast, surging crowds; but no matter\r\nhow timid they be, a few rickshaw rides along the streets, a short\r\nobservation of the manners of these people, will make the faintest\r\nhearted feel at home. Before long these Tartaric hordes cease to be\r\nterrifying, and even the feeling that they are ethnological specimens\r\npasses away; it is remarkable how soon one feels the humanity of it\r\nall among these multitudes that seem to engulf but that never press or\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nLooking down upon a Chinese street, with multitudes of walkers and\r\nrunners passing back and forth, mingled among donkey carts, riders on\r\nhorse- or donkey-back, mule litters, rickshaws, camel caravans, flocks\r\nof animals led to sale and slaughter, together with rapidly flying\r\nautomobiles--all gives the impression of perfect control of motion and\r\navoidance, of crowding and scuffling, and recalls the movements of\r\npractised dancers on a crowded ballroom floor. A view of the crowds\r\nwhich patiently wait at the great gateways for their turn to pass\r\nthrough affords a constant source of amusement and delight. The line\r\nslowly pushes through the gate like an endless string being threaded\r\nthrough a needle. If there is mishap or collision, though voices of\r\nprotest may arise, they will never be those of the stoic, dignified\r\npersons sitting in the rickshaws; it is against etiquette for the\r\npassenger to excite himself about anything, and he leaves that to the\r\nrickshaw man. All humanity and animaldom live and work together in\r\nChina, in almost undisturbed harmony and mutual understanding.\r\n\r\nOnly occasionally a hubbub of altercation rises to the skies. In\r\nthese days the pigtails had only just been abolished. Under the old\r\nconditions, the technique of personal combat was for each party to\r\ngrab the other by the cue and hold him there, while describing to him\r\nhis true character. During the first years of the reform era one might\r\nstill see men who were having a difference frantically grabbing at the\r\nback of each other's heads where there was, however, no longer anything\r\nto afford a secure hold.\r\n\r\nA great part of Chinese life is public. It is on the streets with\r\ntheir innumerable restaurants; their wide-open bazaars of the trades;\r\ntheir ambulent letter-writers and story-tellers with the curious ones\r\nclustered about them; their itinerant markets; their gliding rickshaws;\r\ntheir haphazard little shops filled with a profusion of ageless,\r\nprecious relics. There is the charm of all this and of the humanity\r\nthere swarming, with its good-natured consideration for the other\r\nfellow, its constant movement, its excited chatter, its animation and\r\nits pensiveness, and its occasional moments of heated but bloodless\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nOLD CONFUCIANISM IN THE NEW CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The whole Chinese people hold the doctrines of Confucius most sacred,\"\r\ndeclared President Yuan Shih-kai in his decree of November 26, 1913,\r\nwhich re-introduced much of the old state religion. He stopped a little\r\nshort of giving Confucianism the character of an established religion,\r\nbut ordered that the sacrificial rites and the biennial commemoration\r\nexercises be restored. \"I am strongly convinced,\" he said, \"of the\r\nimportance of preserving the traditional beliefs of China.\" In this\r\nhe was upheld by the Confucian Society at Peking, in the organization\r\nof which an American university graduate, Dr. Chen Huan-chang, was a\r\nleading spirit. Mr. Chen's doctoral dissertation had dealt with the\r\neconomic principles of Confucius and his school; upon his return to\r\nChina his aim had been to make Confucianism the state religion under\r\nthe Republic.\r\n\r\nThe Christian missionaries were agitated. They felt it to be a step\r\nbackward for the new republic to recognize any form of belief.\r\nYuan, however, said: \"It is rather the ethic and moral principles\r\nof Confucius, as a part of education, that the Government wishes\r\nto emphasize.\" As there is nothing mystical or theological about\r\nConfucianism, such a view is, indeed, quite tenable.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai again declared toward the end of December: \"I have\r\ndecided to perform the worship of heaven on the day of the winter\r\nsolstice.\"\r\n\r\nThis fell on the 23rd of December, and again excited discussion.\r\n\"It means that Yuan is edging toward the assumption of the Imperial\r\ndignity,\" many said.\r\n\r\nI had a talk about this matter with the Minister of the Interior, Mr.\r\nChu Chi-chien, who was thoroughly informed concerning the details\r\nof Confucian worship and the worship of Heaven; he had, in fact, an\r\ninexhaustible fund of knowledge of Chinese traditions. Nevertheless, he\r\nwas a man of action, planning cities, building roads, and developing\r\nindustries. Comparatively young and entirely Chinese by education and\r\ncharacter, he had supremely that knowledge of the personalities of\r\nChinese politics which was necessary in his ministry. As a builder he\r\nbecame the Baron Haussmann of Peking, widening and paving the avenues,\r\nestablishing parks, rearranging public places, in all of which he\r\ndid marvels within his short term of two years. He established the\r\nNational Museum of Peking, and converted a part of the Imperial City\r\ninto a public park which has become a centre of civic life theretofore\r\nunknown in China. Mr. Chu's familiarity with religion, art, and\r\narchitecture--he was a living encyclopædia of archæology and art--and\r\nhis pleasure in reciting the history of some Chinese temple or palace\r\ndid not free him from a modern temptation. He would try to import too\r\nmany foreign elements in the improvements which he planned, so that\r\nforeign friends of Chinese art had to keep close to him to prevent the\r\nbringing in of incongruous Western forms which would have spoiled the\r\nmarvellous harmony of this great city.\r\n\r\n\"It would be dangerous,\" Mr. Chu informed me, \"for the republican\r\ngovernment to neglect the worship of Heaven. The entire farm population\r\nobserves the ceremonial relative to sowing, harvesting, and other\r\nrural occupations according to the old calendar. Should the worship of\r\nHeaven be omitted on the winter solstice day, now that the Government\r\nhas become established; and should there follow a leanness or entire\r\nfailure of crops, the Government would surely be held responsible by\r\nthe farmers throughout the land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he added, smilingly, \"the worship will not guarantee\r\ngood crops, but at any rate it will relieve the Government of\r\nresponsibility.\"\r\n\r\nI could not but reflect that, even in our own democracy,\r\nadministrations have been given credit and blame by reason of general\r\nprosperity or of the lack of it, and that good crops certainly do help\r\nthe party in power.\r\n\r\n\"In the ritual, we shall introduce some changes appropriate to\r\nrepublicanism,\" Mr. Chu assured me. \"I am myself designing a special\r\nceremonial dress to be worn by those participating, and the music\r\nand liturgy will be somewhat changed.\" But it was difficult to see\r\nwherein consisted the specific republican bias of the changes. Yuan\r\nShih-kai did proceed to the Temple of Heaven before daybreak on\r\nDecember 23rd; in the dark of the morning the President drove to that\r\nwonderfully dignified open-air sanctuary in its large sacred grove\r\nalong the southern wall of the Chinese city. He drove surrounded by\r\npersonal bodyguards over streets covered with yellow sand and lined\r\nthree-fold with soldiers stationed there the evening before. With him\r\nwere the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Master of Ceremonies,\r\nthe Censor General, the Minister of War, and a staff of other high\r\nofficials and generals. Arrived at the temple, he changed his uniform\r\nfor the sacrificial robes and hat, and, after ablutions, proceeded\r\ntogether with all the other dignitaries to the great circular altar,\r\nwhich he ascended. He was there joined by the sacrificial meat-bearers,\r\nthe silk and jade bearers, the cupbearers, and those who chanted\r\ninvocations. In succession the different ceremonial offerings were\r\nbrought forward and presented to Heaven with many series of bows. A\r\nprayer was then offered, as follows:\r\n\r\n Heaven, Thou dost look down on us and givest us the nation. All-seeing\r\n and all-hearing, everywhere, yet how near and how close: We come\r\n before Thee on this winter solstice day when the air assumes a new\r\n life; in spirit devout, and with ceremony old, we offer to Thee jade,\r\n silk, and meat. May our prayer and offerings rise unto Thee together\r\n with sweet incense. We sanctify ourselves and pray that Thou accept\r\n our offerings.\r\n\r\nThe first Confucian ceremony, which the President attended in person\r\nat four o'clock in the morning, took place about two months later. A\r\ncomplete rehearsal of the ceremony, with all details, had been held on\r\nthe preceding afternoon. Many foreigners were present. Passing from\r\nthe entrance of the Temple, between rows of immemorial ilex trees,\r\nand through lofty porticoes, in one of which are preserved the famous\r\nstone drums which date from the time of the Sage, the visitors entered\r\nthe innermost enclosure. It, too, is set with ancient trees, which,\r\nhowever, leave the central portion open. The musical instruments were\r\nplaced on the platform in front of the main temple hall. Here the\r\nceremony itself was enacted, while the surface of the court was filled\r\nwith members of the Confucian Society, ranks of dignified long-gowned\r\nmen, members of the best classes of Peking.\r\n\r\nI was told that the music played on this occasion was a modification\r\nof the classic strains which had from time immemorial been heard\r\nhere. Perfect knowledge of this music seems no longer to exist. The\r\nmusic accompanying the ceremony was nevertheless attractive, produced\r\nwith jade plaques, flutes, long-stringed instruments resembling small\r\nharps, but with strings of more uniform length, drums, and cymbals.\r\nA dominant note was struck on one of the jade plaques, whereupon\r\nall the instruments fell in with a humming sound, held for fully a\r\nminute, which resembled the murmur of forest trees or the surging\r\nof waves. There was no melody; only a succession of dominants, with\r\nthe accompaniment of this flow of sound surging up, then ebbing and\r\nreceding. One of the instruments is most curious, in the shape of a\r\nleopard-like animal, in whose back there are closely set about twenty\r\nsmall boards. At certain stages of the music a stick is rapidly passed\r\nover these boards, giving a very peculiar punctuation to the strains\r\nthat are being played.\r\n\r\nThe chief dignitaries officiating were Mr. Chu Chi-chien, the Minister\r\nof the Interior, and Mr. Sun Pao-chi, the Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\ngorgeous in their newly devised ceremonial costumes. The splendid and\r\ndignified surroundings of the temple courts enhanced the ceremony, but\r\nit depended for its effect on the manner of chanting, the music, and\r\nthe very dignified demeanour of all who participated. Quite apart from\r\nthe question of the advisability of a state religion or the possible\r\nreactionary influences which such ceremonies might have, I could not\r\nbut feel that the refusal to cast off entirely such traditions was\r\ninspired by sound instinct.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this revival came during the adoption of new ways. Chinese\r\nladies came out in general society for the first time on the night of\r\nthe 5th of February, at the Foreign Office ball. Many representatives\r\nof the outlying dependencies of China were there in picturesque\r\ncostumes, invariably exhibiting a natural self-confidence which made\r\nthem seem entirely in place in these modern surroundings. The Foreign\r\nOffice building, planned by an American architect, contains on the main\r\nfloor an impressive suite of apartments so arranged as to give ample\r\nspace for large entertainments, while it affords every opportunity for\r\nthe more intimate gathering of smaller groups. Guests were promenading\r\nthrough the long rows of apartments from the ballroom, where the\r\nexcellent Navy Band was playing for the dancers.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese women gave no hint of being unaccustomed to such general\r\ngatherings of society, but bore themselves with natural ease and\r\ndignity. Nor did they conceal their somewhat amused interest in the\r\nforms of the modern dance; for only a few of the younger Chinese\r\nladies had at that time acquired this Western art. The number of\r\nvotaries, however, increased rapidly during the next few years.\r\n\r\nFrom among the Tartars of the outlying regions this occasion was graced\r\nby a Living Buddha from Mongolia, to whom the Chinese officials were\r\nmost attentive. Surrounded by a large retinue, he overtopped them\r\nall, and his bodily girth seemed enormous. He found his way early in\r\nthe evening to a room where refreshments were being offered, took\r\npossession of a table, and proceeded to divest himself of seven or\r\neight layers of outer garments. Thus reduced, he became a man of\r\nmore normal dimensions. Several of his servitors then went foraging\r\namong the various tables, bringing choice dishes to which the Living\r\nBuddha did all justice. Long after midnight reports still came to the\r\nballroom: \"The Living Buddha is still eating.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems remarkable that Chinese women should so readily adapt\r\nthemselves to wholly new situations. They have shown themselves capable\r\nof leadership in social, political, and scientific matters; a great\r\nmany develop wide intellectual interests and manifest keen mental\r\npowers. When I gave the Commencement address at the Women's Medical\r\nCollege of Peking, the 13th of February, I was curious to see what\r\ntypes of Chinese women would devote themselves to a medical education.\r\nIn this field Dr. King Ya-mei and Dr. Mary Stone are the pioneers.\r\nWith the advance of modern medicine in China many Chinese women have\r\nadopted the career of nurses and of physicians. On this occasion the\r\nwomen students of the middle school sang various selections, and I\r\nwas impressed with the cello-like quality of their alto voices. As\r\ncustomary on such occasions my address was made through an interpreter.\r\nThe delivery of these chopped-off paragraphs can scarcely be inspiring,\r\nyet Chinese audiences are so courteous and attentive that they never\r\ngive the speaker any suggestion of impatience.\r\n\r\nA luncheon at the Botanical Gardens was given the next day by the\r\nMinister of Agriculture, Mr. Chang Chien. This institution, to\r\nwhich a small and rather hungry-looking collection of animals is\r\nappended, occupies an extensive area outside of the northwest gate,\r\nand was formerly a park or pleasure garden of the Empress Dowager. A\r\nmodern-style building, erected for her use and composed of large main\r\napartments on each floor, with smaller side-chambers opening out from\r\nthem, was used for our luncheon party. Its walls were still hung with\r\npictures painted by the hand of the august lady, who loved to vary her\r\nbusy life by painting flowers. The conversation here was mostly on\r\nChinese art, there being among the guests an antiquarian expert, Chow,\r\nwho exhibited some fine scrolls of paintings. I noted that the Chinese\r\nevinced the same interest in the writing appended to the paintings\r\n(colophon) as in the picture itself. They seemed to admire especially\r\nthe ability, in some famous writers, of executing complicated strokes\r\nwithout hesitation and with perfect control. When we were looking at a\r\npage written by a famous Sung poet, Mr. Chow said: \"He always finished\r\na stroke lightly, like his poems, still leaving something unsaid.\"\r\n\r\nChinese handwriting has infinite power to express differences of\r\ncharacter and cultivation. It is closely associated with personality.\r\nSome writing has the precision of a steel engraving; other examples,\r\nagain, show the sweep and assurance of a brush wielded by a Franz Hals.\r\nIt is the latter that the Chinese particularly admire; and even without\r\nany knowledge of Chinese script one cannot but be impressed with its\r\nartistic quality and its power to reveal personal characteristics. It\r\nis still the great ambition of educated Chinese to write well--that is,\r\nwith force and individual expression. My host on this occasion was one\r\nof the most noted calligraphers in China. Many emulated him; among them\r\na northern military governor who had risen from the ranks, but spent\r\nlaborious hours every day decorating huge scrolls with a few characters\r\nhe had learned, with which to gladden the hearts of his friends.\r\n\r\nThe new things cropping out in Chinese life had their detractors. Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Rockhill had come to Peking for a visit. Relieved of official\r\nduties through a change in the administration, it was quite natural\r\nthat Mr. Rockhill should return where his principal intellectual\r\ninterests lay. Throughout our first conversation at dinner Mrs.\r\nRockhill affected a very reactionary view of things in China, praising\r\nthe Empire and making fun of all attempts at modernization. One would\r\nhave thought her not only a monarchist, but a believer in absolutism\r\nof the old Czarist type. A woman so clever can make any point of view\r\nseem reasonable. Mr. Rockhill did not express himself so strongly, but\r\nhe was evidently also filled with regret for the old days in China\r\nwhich had passed. While we were together receiving guests at a dinner I\r\nwas giving Mr. Rockhill, some of the young Foreign Office counsellors\r\nappeared in the distance, wearing conventional evening clothes. \"How\r\nhorrible,\" Mr. Rockhill murmured, quite distressed. Not perceiving\r\nanything unusual to which his expression of horror could refer, I\r\nasked, \"What?\" \"They ought to wear their native costume,\" he answered;\r\n\"European dress is intolerable on them, and it is so with all these\r\nattempted imitations.\"\r\n\r\nThe talk at another dinner, a small gathering including Mr. Rockhill,\r\nDoctor Goodnow, and Dr. Henry C. Adams, revolved around conditions\r\nin China and took a rather pessimistic tone. Doctor Adams had been\r\nelaborating a system of unified accounting for the railways. \"At every\r\nturn,\" he said, \"we seem to get into a blind alley leading up to a\r\nplace where some spider of corruption sits, the whole tribe manipulated\r\nby a powerful head spider.\"\r\n\r\nThis inheritance of corruption from the easy-going past, when the\r\nlarger portion of official incomes was made up of commissions and\r\nfees, was recognized to be a great evil by all the more enlightened\r\nChinese officials. They attempted to combat it in behalf of efficient\r\nadministration but they could not quite perform the heroic task of\r\nlifting the entire system bodily onto a new basis. Because the new\r\nmethods would require greatly increased salaries, the ideal of strict\r\naccountability, honesty, and efficiency, could only be gradually\r\napproached. Doctor Goodnow for his part contributed to the conversation\r\na sense of all the difficulties encountered by saying: \"Here is a\r\nhitherto non-political society which had vegetated along through\r\ncenturies held together by self-enforced social and moral bonds,\r\nwithout set tribunals or formal sanction. Now it suddenly determines\r\nto take over elections, legislatures, and other elements of our more\r\nabstract and artificial Western system. I incline to believe that it\r\nwould be infinitely better if the institutional changes had been more\r\ngradual, if the system of representation had been based rather on\r\nexisting social groupings and interests than on the abstract idea of\r\nuniversal suffrage. These political abstractions as yet mean nothing to\r\nthe Chinese by way of actual experience.\"\r\n\r\nHe also did not approve of the persistent desire of the democratic\r\nparty to establish something analogous to the English system of cabinet\r\ngovernment. He felt that far more political experience was needed for\r\nworking so delicate a system. \"I am inclined to look to concentration\r\nof power and responsibility in the hands of the President for more\r\nsatisfactory results,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Rockhill's fundamental belief was that it would be far better for\r\nthe world not to have meddled with China at all. \"She should be allowed\r\nto continue under her social system,\" he urged, \"a system which has\r\nstood the test of thousands of years; and to trust that the gradual\r\ninfluence of example would bring about necessary modifications.\" He\r\nhad thorough confidence in the ability of Yuan Shih-kai, if allowed a\r\nfree hand, to govern China in accordance with her traditional ideas but\r\nwith a sufficient application of modern methods. He even considered the\r\nstrict press censorship applied by Yuan Shih-kai's government as proper\r\nunder the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThroughout this conversation, which dwelt mostly on difficulties,\r\nshortcomings and corruption, there was, nevertheless, a notable\r\nundercurrent of confidence in the Chinese _people_. These experienced\r\nmen whose work brought them into contact with specific evils, looked at\r\nthe Chinese, not from the ordinary viewpoint so usual with foreigners\r\nwho assume the utter hopelessness of the whole China business, but much\r\nas they would consider the shortcomings of their own nation, with an\r\nunderlying faith in the inherent strength and virtue of the national\r\ncharacter. The idea of China being bankrupt was laughed to scorn by\r\nMr. Rockhill. \"There are its vast natural and human resources,\" he\r\nexclaimed. \"The human resources are not just a quantity of crude\r\nphysical man power, but there is a very highly trained industrial\r\ncapacity in the handicrafts.\" But it is exactly when we realize the\r\nstupendous possibilities of the country, her resources of material\r\nwealth, her man power, her industrial skill, and her actual capital\r\nthat the difficulties which obstruct her development seem so deplorable.\r\n\r\nMr. Liang Chi-chao gave a dinner at about this time, at which Doctor\r\nAdams, Doctor Goodnow, President Judson of Chicago, and the ladies\r\nwere present. Mr. Liang had a cook who was a master in his art, able\r\nto produce all that infinite variety of savory distinction with which\r\nmeat, vegetables, and pastry can be prepared by the Chinese. One\r\nusually speaks of Chinese dinners as having from one hundred fifty\r\nto two hundred courses. It would be more accurate, however, to speak\r\nof so many dishes, as at all times there are a great many different\r\ndishes on the table from which the guests make selection. The profusion\r\nof food supplied at such a dinner is certainly astonishing. The\r\nguests will take a taste here and there; but the greater part of it\r\nis sent back to the household and retainers. It is a popular mistake\r\nto believe that Chinese food is composed of unusual dishes. There are\r\nindeed birdsnest soup, shark fins, and ducks' kidneys, but the real\r\nexcellence of Chinese cooking lies in the ability to prepare one thing,\r\nsuch as chicken, or fish, in innumerable ways, with endless varieties\r\nof crispness, consistency, and flavour. It is notable to what extent\r\nmeat predominates. Although there is always a variety of vegetables\r\nand of fruit, the amount of meat consumed by the Chinese is certainly\r\nastonishing to one who has classified them, as is usually done, as a\r\nvegetarian people.\r\n\r\nThe show of abundance at a Chinese banquet seems the fare of poverty\r\ncompared with the cargoes of delicacies served at the Imperial table.\r\nIt was a rule of the Imperial household that any dish which the Emperor\r\nhad at any time called for, must be served him at the principal meal\r\nevery day; as his reign lengthened the numbers of dishes at his table,\r\nnaturally, constantly increased. It is related that the dinner of the\r\nEmperor Chen Lung required one hundred and twenty tables; and the\r\nEmpress Dowager, at the time of her death, had worked up to about\r\nninety-six tables. It is not to be wondered at that the Emperor's\r\nkitchen had an army of three hundred cooks! At one time when the Duke\r\nTsai was discussing with me the financial situation of the Imperial\r\nfamily, he remarked, with a deep sigh: \"The Emperor has had to reduce\r\nthe number of his servants. For instance, at present he has only thirty\r\ncooks.\" Not knowing of the custom described above, I was inclined to\r\nconsider that number quite adequate. I believe the little Emperor has\r\nat the time I write reached the quota of about fifteen tables.\r\n\r\nAt the hospitable board of Mr. Liang Chi-chao, while the dishes were\r\nserved in Chinese style and the food eaten with chopsticks, some\r\nmodifications of the usual dinner procedure had been made. The\r\netiquette of a Chinese meal requires that when a new set of dishes with\r\nfood has been placed in the centre of the table, the host, hostess,\r\nand other members of the family survey what is there and pick out the\r\nchoicest morsels to lay on the plates of their guests. The guests then\r\nreciprocate the courtesy, and the interchange of favours continues\r\nthroughout the dinner, giving the whole affair a most sociable aspect.\r\nAt Mr. Liang Chi-chao's table these courtesies were observed, but there\r\nwere special chopsticks provided for taking the food from the central\r\ndishes and transferring it to a neighbour's or to one's own.\r\n\r\nThe conversation after dinner wandered toward Chinese ethics. Mr. Liang\r\nChi-chao is one of the most competent authorities on this subject\r\nand on its relations to Western thought and life. I ventured this\r\nopinion: \"While the high respect in which the elders are held by the\r\nyounger generation in China is a remarkably strong social cement, it is\r\ndiscouraging to progress in that it gives the younger and more active\r\nlittle chance to carry out their own ideas.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the system does not,\" Mr. Liang rejoined, \"necessarily work\r\nto retard change; because it is, after all, society rather than\r\nindividuals which controls. With all proper respect for elders, the\r\nyounger element has ample opportunity to bring forward and carry out\r\nideas of social change.\"\r\n\r\nHe regarded the principle of respect for elders and of ancestor worship\r\nof fundamental importance; in addition to its direct social effects,\r\nit gave to Chinese society all that the Western peoples derive from\r\nthe belief in immortality. The living individual feels a keen sense\r\nof permanence through the continuity of a long line of ancestors,\r\nwhose influence perceptibly surrounds those actually living; moreover,\r\ntheir own actions are raised to a higher plane, as seen not from the\r\nnarrow interests of the present, but in relation to the life of the\r\ngenerations that are to succeed, in whom the character and action of\r\nthe individual now living will persist.\r\n\r\nThis evening's entertainment, with its intimate Chinese setting\r\nand its conversation dealing with the deeper relationships between\r\ndifferent civilizations, has remained a memorable experience for those\r\nwho attended it. Only recently it was thus recalled by one of the\r\nguests: \"Think of going to a dinner with the 'Secretary of Justice' in\r\nWashington, and conversing about the immortality of the soul!\"\r\n\r\nInterested to see how, despite the new ways in China, the old\r\nConfucianism persisted, I determined upon a pilgrimage to the Confucian\r\nshrines. Dr. Henry C. Adams invited me in November, 1914, to join him\r\non a trip to the sacred mountain, Taishan, in Shantung Province, and to\r\nChüfu, the home of Confucius.\r\n\r\nA small party was made up. I slipped away quietly in order to avoid\r\nofficial attentions and to spare the local authorities all the bother\r\nof formally entertaining a foreign representative. We arrived at\r\nTaianfu early in the morning, where with the help of missionaries\r\nchair-bearers had been secured to carry us up the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe trip to these sacred heights is of an unusual character. The ascent\r\nfrom the base is almost continuously over stair-ways. Up these steep\r\nand difficult grades two sturdy chairmen, with a third as alternate,\r\nwill carry the traveller rapidly and with easy gait. The route is\r\nfascinating not only because of the singular natural beauty of the\r\nravines through which it passes, and of the constantly broadening\r\nprospects over the fruitful plains of Shantung from every eminence, but\r\nbecause of the historic interest of the place; this is testified to by\r\ninnumerable temples, monuments, tablets, and inscriptions sculptured\r\nin the living rock which line the path up the mountain. It must be\r\nremembered that in the time of Confucius this was already a place\r\nof pilgrimage of immemorial tradition; a place of special grandeur,\r\nwherein the mind might be freed of its narrow needs and find its\r\nplace in the infinite. Many of its monuments refer to Confucius and\r\nrecord his sayings as he stopped by the way to rest or to behold the\r\nprospect. At one point, whence one looks off a steep precipice down to\r\nthe plain thousands of feet below, his saying, as reported, was: \"Seen\r\nfrom this height, man is indeed but a speck or insect.\" But not all\r\nof his remarks were of this obvious nature, which justifies itself in\r\nits appeal to the common mind, to be initiated into the truths of the\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nIn these thousands of years many other sages, emperors, and statesmen\r\nhave ascended the sacred hill, also leaving memorials in the shape of\r\nsculptured stones bearing their sentiments. It would be an agreeable\r\ntask for a vacation to read these inscriptions and to let the\r\nimagination shadow forth again these unending pilgrimages extending\r\nback to the dawn of history.\r\n\r\nThe stairway leading up the mountain, which is about 6,000 feet high,\r\nis often so steep that we had to guard against being overcome by\r\ndizziness in looking down. Occasionally a stop is made at a wayside\r\ntemple, where tea is served in the shady courts. In the summer heat\r\nthese refuges must be especially grateful. We reached the temples that\r\ncrown the summit after a journey of about six hours. In a temple court\r\nat the very top the servants who had preceded us had set up their\r\nkitchen, and an ample luncheon was awaiting us there.\r\n\r\nAt this altitude a cold and cutting wind was blowing. Yet we preferred\r\nto stay outside of the temple buildings in order to enjoy the view\r\nwhich is here unrolled, embracing a great portion of the whole province\r\nof Shantung. I noted that the coolies did not seem impressed with the\r\nsanctity of this majestic height, but used the temple courts as a\r\ncaravanserai.\r\n\r\nThe descent is made rapidly, as the practised chair-bearers run\r\ndown the stairs with quick, sure steps--which gives the passenger\r\nthe sensation of skirting the mountainside in an aeroplane. When I\r\ninquired whether accidents did not occasionally happen, they told me:\r\n\"Yes, but the last time when any one has fallen was about four hundred\r\nyears ago.\" As in the early days chair-bearers who had fallen were\r\nkilled, the tendency to fall was in the course of time eradicated. They\r\ndescend with a gliding motion that reminds one of the flight of birds.\r\nThe chair-bearers are united in a guild, and happen to be Mohammedans\r\nby religion.\r\n\r\nThe town of Taianfu, which lies at the foot of the mountain, is\r\nnotable for a very ancient and stately temple dedicated to the god\r\nwho represents the original nature worship which centres around Mount\r\nTaishan, and which forms the historic basis for all religion in\r\nChina. The spacious temple courts, with their immemorial trees and\r\ntheir forests of tall stone tablets bearing inscriptions dedicated by\r\nemperors for thousands of years past, testify to the strength of the\r\nnative faith. The streets of the town, set at frequent intervals with\r\narches bearing sculptured animal forms, were lined with shops through\r\nwhose trellised windows, now that night had come, lights were shining,\r\nrevealing the activities within. These, with an occasional tall tower\r\nor temple shadowing the gathering darkness, made this old town appear\r\nfull of romance and strange beauty.\r\n\r\nSleeping on our car, we were by night carried to the railway station of\r\nChüfu; some seven miles farther on lies the town of the same name, the\r\nhome of Confucius. We hired donkey carts at the station; also, as the\r\nladies were anxious to have the experience of using the local passenger\r\nvehicle, the wheel-barrow, we engaged a few of these; whereupon our\r\nmodest cavalcade proceeded first to the Confucian burial ground, to the\r\nnorth of the city. On the way thither we were met by chair-bearers who\r\ncarried a portable throne and brought complimentary messages from the\r\nHoly Duke. As the chair had been sent for my use, there was nothing for\r\nit but to get in. Soon appeared, also, a string of mule carts drawn by\r\nsleek and well-fed animals, contrasting with the bony and dishevelled\r\nbeasts we had hired.\r\n\r\nIt was plain that the incognito was ended, and that the Duke had been\r\napprised of our coming. Then came the emissaries of the district\r\nmagistrate, offering further courtesies, such as a guard of honour; and\r\nanother delegation from the Duke brought a huge red envelope containing\r\nan invitation for luncheon. We tried to decline all these civilities\r\nand to stroll about quietly, in order to come entirely under the spell\r\nof this place. But there was no more rambling and strolling for us. We\r\nhad to sit in our chairs and carts, and, after two polite declinations\r\nof the luncheon invitation, alleging the shortness of our time and our\r\ndesire to see everything thoroughly, and asking leave to call on the\r\nDuke later in the afternoon--we accepted the customary third issue of\r\nthe ducal invitation.\r\n\r\nOur procession was quite imposing as we passed on to the inner gate of\r\nthe cemetery. Covering about one and a half square miles, the enclosure\r\nhas been the burial ground of the Confucian family for at least three\r\nthousand years, antedating Confucius himself. No other family in the\r\nworld has such memorials of its continuity. The simple dignity of a\r\nhuge marble slab set erect before the mound-covered grave marks the\r\nburial place of the sage. The adjoining site of the house where his\r\ndisciples guarded his tomb for generations, but which ultimately\r\ndisappeared some two thousand years ago, also bears monuments and\r\ninscriptions.\r\n\r\nLeaving the cemetery, a large cavalry escort sent by the district\r\nmagistrate joined our cavalcade of chairs, mule carts, and\r\nwheelbarrows, together with crowds of the curious who trudged\r\nalong. The village streets were lined with people anxious to see\r\nthe strangers; but their curiosity had nothing intrusive. They were\r\nfriendly lookers-on, nodding a pleasant welcome should your eye catch\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nWe passed through many gates of the ancient palace before we were\r\nfinally received by the Duke himself at the main inner doorway. He was\r\naccompanied by the magistrate, and with these two we sat down to chat;\r\nnearly an hour elapsed before we were summoned to the table. The meal,\r\nwhich was made up of innumerable courses, lasted at least two hours,\r\nduring which we kept up an animated conversation concerning the more\r\nrecent history of the town and of the temple.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was agitated because missionaries from Taianfu were trying to\r\nacquire land in the town of Chüfu. He looked upon this intrusion as\r\nunwarranted, saying that as his town was devoted to the memory of the\r\nChinese sage, it did not seem suitable that any foreign religion should\r\ntry to introduce its worship, and it would certainly result in local\r\nill-feeling.\r\n\r\nI tried to quiet his apprehensions by speaking of the educational work\r\nof missionaries, of the fact that they, also, respected the great sage;\r\nbut it was hard to allay his opposition.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate was jovial, laughing uproariously at the mildest joke.\r\nWhen we arose from the table, the Duke took us to the apartments of the\r\nDuchess, who was staying with the infant daughter recently born, their\r\nfirst child. The Duchess was his second wife, and he was considerably\r\nher senior. The little lady seemed to be particularly fond of cats, of\r\nwhich at least forty were playing about her; one of these she presented\r\nto Mrs. Adams.\r\n\r\nThe great Temple of Confucius immediately adjoins the palace. Although\r\nthe afternoon was wearing on, we still had time to visit it and to\r\nwander about in its noble courts. The pillars in the main halls are\r\nadorned by marvellous sculpture, and the temple is remarkable for\r\nthe refined beauty of the structures composing it and for the serene\r\ndignity of its aspect. Adjoining the main temple is an ancient well\r\nnear which stood the original house of Confucius. Stone reliefs\r\npresent in a long series the history of Confucius in pictures, and\r\nthere is a great collection of instruments used in performing the\r\nclassical music. But the chief charm of the temple lies in the vistas\r\nafforded by its courts, set with magnificent trees and with the\r\nmonuments of the past seventy generations.\r\n\r\nIt was dark when we had finished our visit to the temple. We bade\r\nthe Duke farewell, and our cavalcade, starting back to the station,\r\nwas now made picturesque by the flaring torches and the huge paper\r\nlanterns which were carried alongside each chair and cart. Slowly the\r\nprocession wound its way back over the dark plains toward the lights\r\nof the station platform and the emblems of a mechanical civilization\r\nthat contrasted at every point with the life we had seen. The Duke had\r\nregretted having objected so strongly to the proposal to bring the\r\nrailway closer to the town, for it was of inconvenience to visitors;\r\nbut he felt, after all, that the great sage himself would always prefer\r\nthe peacefulness and quiet of the older civilization.\r\n\r\nI revisited Chüfu three years later, this time with Mr. Charles R.\r\nCrane and Mrs. Reinsch, who had been unable to accompany me on the\r\nfirst visit. The officials were expecting us, and everywhere we were\r\nfollowed with attentions. Not satisfied with giving us two private\r\ncars, the railway officials insisted that we have a special engine,\r\ntoo. In the region of Chüfu we gathered an army of military escorts.\r\nArriving at the palace, the Duke greeted us with a child on either\r\narm. The little daughter was now over three, the son slightly over\r\none year old. I have never seen any one who appeared more devoted to\r\nhis children than the Duke. He always had them with him, carried them\r\nabout, playing with them and fondling them. When he and the Duchess\r\nvisited us in Peking he brought the two little ones, and they and my\r\nsmall children played long together joyfully and to the amusement\r\nof their elders. The Duke was tall, broad-shouldered, aristocratic\r\nlooking. While not credited with great ability, he was undoubtedly a\r\nman of intelligence, although his education had been narrowly classical\r\nand had not given him contact with the world's affairs. He was\r\nseventy-third in line from the great sage. At that time he was engaged\r\nespecially with plans to create in Chüfu a university wherein the\r\nConfucian tradition should be preserved in its purity, but which should\r\nalso teach modern science.\r\n\r\nOnce during the revolution against the Manchus the Duke was considered\r\na possible successor to the throne. If the country had had a Chinese\r\nfamily of great prominence in affairs, the transfer of the monarchy\r\nto a Chinese house might have been accomplished, but the Duke was by\r\nno means a man of action or a politician. Neither had the descendants\r\nof the Ming, Sung, and Chow emperors, or of other Imperial houses,\r\nsufficient prominence or genius for leadership to command national\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe title of the Holy Duke is the only one in China which remains\r\npermanently the same. Under the empire, titles were granted, but in\r\neach succeeding generation the rank was lowered by one grade until the\r\nstatus of a commoner had again been reached. By this arrangement, under\r\nwhich noble rank gradually \"petered out,\" China escaped the creation of\r\na class or caste of nobility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nA GLIMPSE BEHIND THE POLITICAL SCENES\r\n\r\n\r\nModelling largely on American example, China is striving to create\r\ntruly representative political institutions. Personal rule, imperial\r\ntraditions, hamper the Chinese in their efforts, unguided as they\r\nare by experience; moreover, they meet with foreign skepticism and\r\nopposition. It is America's rôle not officiously to interfere in their\r\nendeavours, but in every proper way to help them.\r\n\r\nThe institutions a nation develops are largely its own business.\r\nOther nations should not interfere. But in China all liberal-minded,\r\nforward-looking men see in the United States a free government which\r\nthey not only wish to emulate, but to which they look for interest,\r\nsympathy, and moral assistance. The results of their efforts are by\r\nno means indifferent to us. Should they fail, should militarist and\r\nabsolutist elements gain the upper hand; particularly, should China\r\nbecome an appendage to a foreign militarist autocracy, grave dangers\r\nwould arise. The ideals of the progressive Chinese are in keeping with\r\nthe peaceful, industrious traditions of China. With these traditions\r\nAmericans in China are closely allied. They do not seek, nor have they\r\nneed to seek, to control by political means the choice of the Chinese\r\npeople. On the other hand, it would be difficult for them to tolerate\r\nany attempt to prevent the Chinese from freely following the model of\r\ntheir choice, and from securing those mutually helpful relations with\r\nAmericans which they themselves desire. In this sense only, then, have\r\nAmericans a vital interest in Chinese politics. That personal rule and\r\nimperial traditions, as well as military despotism, are still powerful\r\nenough to hamper the will of the new Chinese democracy may be manifest\r\nfrom a few instances that early came to my attention.\r\n\r\nThe first case was that of Mr. C.T. Wang. When he related to me the\r\nhistory of the dissolution of his party--he was and still is one of the\r\nleaders of the democratic party (Kuo Min Tang)--he told me that he was\r\nin great personal danger. Mr. Wang had been marked for execution as a\r\nleader of the disbanded party and he was living in concealment as a\r\nrefugee.\r\n\r\nHis call upon me, shortly after my arrival in Peking, was my first\r\ndirect contact with Chinese internal or party politics. He had greeted\r\nme at the railway station upon my arrival, and now he told me the story\r\nof Yuan Shih-kai's successful attempt to break down the opposition of\r\nthe parliament and to render that body entirely innocuous. Mr. Wang was\r\nthe Vice-President of the Senate, and through his party was associated\r\nwith Dr. Sun Yat-sen and General Huang Hsin, the men who had attempted\r\nthe revolution during the summer just passed. But Mr. Wang represented\r\nthe younger, more modern-minded elements in the party, who desired to\r\nadopt the best institutions and practices of the West, but who did not\r\nfavour violent measures.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai had divided the majority party, in order in the end to\r\ndestroy its two sections. The most recent action in this fight was the\r\ndissolution of the Kuo Min Tang, which was decreed by the President\r\non November 5th, on the ground that this body was implicated in, and\r\nresponsible for, the revolutionary movement against the President. The\r\nPresident had approached the Tutuhs--or military governors, after the\r\ndownfall of Yuan Shih-kai called Tuchuns--in the various provinces\r\nand had secured in advance an endorsement of his action. Of course,\r\nthis appeal ignored the constitutional character which the state was\r\nsupposed to have, and encouraged the military governors in thinking\r\nthat they were semi-independent rulers. After the death of Yuan their\r\nsense of their own importance and independence grew apace. They\r\nimitated him in looking upon their armies as their personal property.\r\nMoreover, they seized control of the provincial taxes. From all this\r\narose that pseudo-feudalism of military despots, which is the baneful\r\nheritage left by Yuan Shih-kai in China.\r\n\r\nI had already received, through the Department of State, an inquiry\r\nfrom American friends concerning Mr. Wang's safety. He was graduated\r\nfrom Yale University, was first among the American-returned students,\r\nand favourably known among Americans in general. He had been the\r\npresident of the Chinese Y.M.C.A. and bore the reputation of being an\r\nable, clean-handed, and conscientious man. I could not, of course,\r\nknow in how serious danger Mr. Wang found himself, nor could I make\r\nany formal representations in a case where the facts were unknown.\r\nHowever, through making inquiry as to whether any unfavourable action,\r\nsuch as arrest, was contemplated, I hinted to the Government that any\r\nharsh action against Mr. Wang would be noted. The very fact that a\r\nwell-disposed foreign nation is taking notice will tend to prevent rash\r\nor high-handed action, which is frequently forced by some individual\r\nhothead commander or official. When public attention has been directed\r\nto the unjust treatment of a man, rash vindictiveness may be restrained\r\nby wiser heads.\r\n\r\nA further example of the working of Chinese internal politics which\r\ncame under my observation at this time is shown in the method by which\r\nYuan Shih-kai politely imprisoned the Vice-President.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time Yuan Shih-kai had made efforts to induce the\r\nVice-President, General Li Yuan-hung, to come to Peking from Wuchang,\r\nwhere he was stationed in command of troops. He had sent him messengers\r\nand letters, protesting the need he felt of having General Li closely\r\nby his side in order to profit by his support and advice on important\r\naffairs. These polite invitations had been answered by General Li\r\nin a most self-deprecatory tone; he could not aspire to the merit\r\nand wisdom attributed to him by the President; he could be of but\r\nlittle assistance in important affairs of state; it was far better\r\nfor him to stay in his position as commander at Wuchang, whence he\r\ncould effectively support the authority of the President and all his\r\nbeneficent works.\r\n\r\nThis interchange of correspondence went on for some time. It was\r\nevident that General Li did not wish to come to Peking. It was surmised\r\nthat the President did not like the prominence which the democratic\r\nparty had given to the name of General Li Yuang-hung, whom they had\r\nheralded as a true republican and a man of popular sympathies. Probably\r\nYuan feared that General Li might be placed at the head of a new\r\npolitical movement against the President's authority.\r\n\r\nThe President not only sent messengers and letters of cordial\r\ninvitation, but he also rearranged the disposal of troops, with the\r\nresult that bodies of troops upon which Yuan Shih-kai could rely were\r\ndrawn around Wuchang with a constantly shortening radius. Finally in\r\nDecember General Li realized that he had no alternative. He therefore\r\ninformed the latest messenger of Tuan that he could no longer resist\r\nthe repeated cordial invitations, and that while he was sharply\r\nconscious of his shortcomings, he would endeavour to assist the chief\r\nmagistrate to the limit of his powers.\r\n\r\nHe came to Peking in December, without troops of his own. The President\r\nreceived him with the greatest cordiality, embracing him and vowing\r\nthat now the burden of responsibility was lightened for him; that he\r\nmust have his great associate and friend always close at hand, where\r\nhe could consult with him daily, in fact, any hour of the day and\r\nnight; he therefore invited General Li to make his home close to the\r\npalace of Yuan, namely, on the little island in the South Lake in whose\r\nmany-coloured, gracefully formed halls, Emperor Kwang Hsu was for many\r\nyears kept a prisoner by the Empress Dowager.\r\n\r\nThere General Li took his residence, knowing that his great friend the\r\nfirst magistrate could not spare his presence at any hour of day or\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe question arose whether the foreign representatives should call on\r\nthe newly arrived Vice-President. The Government tentatively suggested\r\nthat as hosts it might be proper for them to make the first call.\r\nWhether or not this was done in the expectation that the suggestion\r\nwould not be accepted, it certainly was not the desire of Yuan Shih-kai\r\nto encourage close relations between the Vice-President and any\r\noutsiders.\r\n\r\nAlthough Yuan Shih-kai still allowed the rump parliament to exist,\r\nhe had undoubtedly decided at this time to dispose of it entirely.\r\nA ready pretext was at hand, because, with the expulsion of the Kuo\r\nMin Tang, the parliament no longer could muster a quorum. On November\r\n13th, it was announced that a central administrative conference would\r\nbe created to act in an advisory capacity in matters of government.\r\nIt was plain that this body was intended to displace parliament. The\r\nlist of nominees was made up mostly of men of the old régime, literati\r\nand ex-officials--the kind known among the Chinese as \"skeletons\";\r\na group of high standing and very good reputation, but from which\r\nlittle constructive action could be expected. Among them was a very\r\neffective orator, Ma Liang, a member of the Roman Catholic Church.\r\nHe was a dignified, elderly man, who came to see me to talk about\r\nreforestation and colonization of outlying regions. His contact with\r\nWestern civilization had been through the Jesuit College at Zikawei.\r\nAnother member was Dr. Yen Fu, who had won reputation by translating\r\na large number of scientific works into Chinese and creating a modern\r\nscientific terminology in Chinese. Among other councillors with whom I\r\nbecame well acquainted was Hsu Shih-chang, later President of China,\r\nand Li Ching-hsi, a nephew of Li Hung-chang, who had been Viceroy of\r\nYunnan under the Empire.\r\n\r\nDr. Frank J. Goodnow, the American Constitutional Advisor, often\r\ndiscussed Chinese political affairs with me. It was his impression\r\nthat parliament had attempted to take over too much of Western\r\npolitical practice without sufficiently considering its adaptability\r\nto Chinese uses. He believed that the administrative power should not\r\nbe subject to constant interference by parliament, and that China\r\nwas not yet ready for the cabinet system. He therefore held a rather\r\nconservative view favouring gradual development in the direction\r\nof Western institutions, but not a wholesale adoption of the same.\r\nThe Yuan Shih-kai government took advantage of this attitude of the\r\nAmerican expert to give out, whenever it proposed a new arrangement\r\nfor strengthening its hold, that the matter had the approval of Doctor\r\nGoodnow and other foreign advisers. However, these authorities were not\r\nreally consulted; that is, they were not brought into the important\r\nconferences, nor given the chance to coöperate in the formulation\r\nof vital projects. As a matter of form they were, of course,\r\n\"consulted\"--but usually after the decisions had been made. They were\r\ninformed of what had been agreed upon; and then it was announced that\r\nthe approval of the advisers had been secured. Another example of\r\nthe bland self-sufficiency of Yuan Shih-kai and his government. They\r\nbelieved in themselves; they considered that they were accountable only\r\nto themselves; they had fundamentally the monarchic point of view in\r\nall departments of public service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nWITH MEN WHO WATCH POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nI found in Peking several good observers of political life, especially\r\nDr. George Morrison, Mr. B. Lenox Simpson, and Mr. W.H. Donald. All\r\nthree had the training in observation and judgment which comes from\r\nwriting for responsible papers. Doctor Morrison was gifted with a\r\nmemory for details. Thus, he would say: \"When I first visited New\r\nYork I lived in a little hall room on the third floor of 157 East\r\nTwenty-ninth Street, with a landlady whose name was Simkins, who had\r\ngreen eyes and a red nose and who charged me two dollars a week for my\r\nroom.\" He delighted in detailing minutely his daily doings. His sense\r\nof infinite detail combined with his remarkable memory made Doctor\r\nMorrison an encyclopædia of information about Chinese public men. He\r\nknew their careers, their foibles and ambitions, and their personal\r\nrelationships. Like most British in China he was animated with a\r\nsincere wish to see the Chinese get ahead, and was distressed by the\r\nobstacles which a change for the better encountered at every step.\r\nHis own mind was of the analytical and critical type rather than the\r\nconstructive, and his greatest services were rendered as interpreter\r\nof events and in giving to public men and the people a clear idea of\r\nthe significance of complex Chinese situations. \"I am annoyed,\" he\r\nwould say, \"because kindly old ladies persistently identify me with the\r\nmissionary Morrison who died in 1857.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Donald's acquaintance with Chinese affairs had come through\r\nclose contact with the leaders of new China, with whom he coöperated\r\nintimately in their military and political campaigns. He had a heart\r\nfor the Chinese, as if they had been his own people. He worried about\r\ntheir troubles and fought their fights. Mr. Simpson, the noted writer\r\nwho uses the pen name \"Putnam Weale,\" began active life as a member of\r\nthe Maritime Customs service, but he soon resigned, to devote himself\r\nwholly to literary work. His masterly works of political analysis\r\nwere written in the period of the Russo-Japanese War, although his\r\nbest-known book came a little earlier--a book which long earned him the\r\nill-will and suspicion of many of the legations in Peking. He himself\r\ndisavows giving in \"Indiscreet Letters from Peking\" a recital of\r\nactual facts. He told me: \"I wished to give the psychology of a siege,\r\nselecting from the abundant material significant facts and expressions,\r\nbut I was not in any sense attempting to chronicle events and personal\r\nactions.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Simpson has also written a series of novels dealing with Chinese\r\nlife. The short stories are the best; the longer ones, while\r\ninteresting in description and clever in dialogue, lack that intuitive\r\npower of characterization which is found in the greatest novels, though\r\n\"Wang the Ninth\" which has recently come from the press is an admirable\r\nstudy of Chinese psychology and an excellent story as well. Though his\r\nplayful and cynical mind often led people to judge that he was working\r\nsolely for literary effect, it seemed to me he had a deep appreciation\r\nof what China should mean to the world; he also had real sympathy for\r\nthe Chinese, and desired in every way to help them to realize the great\r\npromise of their country and people. As a conversationalist Mr. Simpson\r\nresembled Macaulay, in that his interludes of silence were infrequent.\r\nNotwithstanding the brilliance of this conversation, luncheon parties\r\nof men occasionally seemed to become restive under a monologue which\r\ngave few others a chance to wedge in a word.\r\n\r\nAside from these three British writers, many other men were following\r\nwith intelligent interest the course of events. Bishop Bashford, gifted\r\nwith a broad and statesmanlike mind, could always be trusted to give\r\npassing events significant interpretations. Dr. W.A.P. Martin had then\r\nreached an age at which the individual details of current affairs no\r\nlonger interested him. His intimate friend, Dr. Arthur H. Smith--a\r\nrarely brilliant extemporaneous speaker--was full of witty and incisive\r\nobservations, often deeply pessimistic, though tempered with a deep\r\nfriendship for the Chinese people.\r\n\r\nAmong the members of the diplomatic corps it was chiefly the Chinese\r\nsecretaries who busied themselves, out of professional interest with\r\nthe details of Chinese affairs, although they did not in all cases\r\nexhibit a broad grasp of the situation.\r\n\r\nMr. Willys R. Peck, Chinese secretary of the American Legation, born in\r\nChina, had a complete mastery of the difficult language of the country.\r\nHe could use it with a colloquial ease that contrasted most pleasantly\r\nwith the stilted and stiff enunciation of the ordinary foreigner\r\nspeaking Chinese. His tact in intercourse with the Chinese and his\r\njudgment on character and political affairs could be relied on. Mr.\r\nPeck took the place of Mr. E.T. Williams, who was called to Washington\r\nas chief of the Far Eastern Division in the State Department. I\r\nconsidered it great good fortune that there should be at the Department\r\na man so experienced and so familiar with Chinese affairs.\r\n\r\nIt was my good fortune to have as first secretary of the legation a man\r\nexceptionally qualified to cope with the difficulties and intricacies\r\nof Chinese affairs. Not only are these affairs infinitely complex in\r\nthemselves, but they have been overlaid through many decades with a web\r\nof foreign treaty provisions, which makes them still more baffling to\r\nthe stranger who tackles them. But Mr. J.V.A. MacMurray, the secretary,\r\nwas possessed of a keenly analytical, legally trained mind which was\r\nable to cut through the most hopelessly tangled snarl of local custom,\r\nnational law, international agreement, and general equity. Also his\r\ninterest in things Chinese was so deep and genuine that his researches\r\nwere never perfunctory. The son of a soldier, he had an almost\r\nreligious devotion to the idea of public service.\r\n\r\nAmong the ministers themselves, Sir John Jordan, actual Dean of the\r\nDiplomatic Corps, was through long experience and careful attention\r\nto affairs most fitted to speak with authority on things Chinese. I\r\nwas immediately greatly attracted to him and formed with him a close\r\nacquaintanceship. This led to constant coöperation throughout the\r\ndifficult years that lay ahead. Sir John was a man of unusually long\r\nand varied experience in China. He came first to the consular service,\r\nthen became minister resident in Korea, and his forty years of official\r\nwork had given him complete intimacy with Chinese affairs. Although he\r\nspeaks Chinese with fluency, in official interviews and conversations\r\nhe was always accompanied by his Chinese secretary and expressed\r\nhimself formally in English. As a matter of fact, few diplomats\r\never use the Chinese language in official conversation. Because of\r\nits infinite shades of meaning it is a complex and rather unprecise\r\nmedium, therefore misunderstandings are more readily avoided through\r\nthe concurrent use of another language. While Sir John understood\r\nChinese character and affairs and was sympathetic with the country in\r\nwhich his life work had been spent, yet there dwelt in him no spirit\r\nof easy compliance. When he considered it necessary, he could insist\r\nso strongly and so emphatically upon the action he desired taken\r\nthat the Chinese often thought of him as harsh and unrelenting: yet\r\nthey always respected his essentially English spirit of fairness and\r\nstraightforwardness.\r\n\r\nOther colleagues with whom close relationships grew up were Don Luis\r\nPastor, the Spanish minister, a gentleman thoroughly American in\r\nhis ways and familiar through long residence in Washington with our\r\naffairs; and Count Sforza, the Italian minister. To the latter China\r\nseemed more or less a place of exile; he appeared bored and only\r\nmoderately interested in the affairs about him. But his legation--with\r\nCountess Sforza, Madame Varè, whose Lombard beauty did not suggest her\r\nScotch origin; the Marquise Denti, with her quizzical, Mona Lisa-like\r\nhaunting smile, concealing great ennui; and the entirely girlish and\r\nplayful Countess Zavagli, a figure which might have stepped out of a\r\nWatteau--was a most charming social centre. M. Beelaerts van Blokland,\r\nthe Netherlands minister, a man of clear-thinking, keen mind, and great\r\nreasonableness, and the Austrian minister, M. von Rosthorn, a profound\r\nChinese scholar, who was then working on a Chinese history, were men of\r\nwhom I saw much during these years.\r\n\r\nThere were few sinologists in Peking at this time. The successive\r\nChinese secretaries of the American Legation ranked high in this\r\nrespect. Of resident sinologists the most noted, Mr. (later Sir) Edward\r\nBackhouse was a recluse, who never allowed himself to be seen in the\r\ncompany of other people of a Western race. At the only period when I\r\nhad long conversations with him I found him much disturbed by wild\r\nrumours current in the Chinese quarter to which I could not attach any\r\nweight. Others whose knowledge of Chinese was exceptional were Mr.\r\nSidney Mayers, representative of the British China Corporation, who had\r\nformerly been in the consular service; Doctor Gattrell, who had acted\r\nas secretary of the American Group; Mr. W.B. Pettus, the director of\r\nthe Peking Language School; Mr. Simpson, already mentioned; and several\r\nmissionaries and professors at Peking University.\r\n\r\nOf the Chinese there were, of course, many with whom I could\r\nprofitably discuss the events of the day and gather suggestions and\r\ninterpretations of value. With all these men I conversed upon events,\r\nrelying for my information not on rumours or reports, but on the facts\r\nwhich I could learn through the men directly concerned; or through\r\nothers well informed. The opinion which I formed from such various\r\nsources about the political condition of China at this time, the spring\r\nof 1914, may be stated as follows:\r\n\r\nThe political authority of the Central Government in China rested upon\r\nmilitary organization. Other sources of authority, such as customary\r\nsubmission on the one hand, and the support based upon the intelligent\r\ncoöperation of all classes of citizens in the achievement of the\r\npurposes of government in accordance with public opinion on the other,\r\nwere only of secondary influence. It was therefore important to inquire\r\nwhether the military power was so organized as to afford a stabilizing\r\nsupport to public authority. This did not seem to be the case.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the existence of a large army of doubtful\r\nefficiency was in itself an evil, considering the then limited\r\nresources of the Chinese State, and the fact that any attempt to reduce\r\nthe military forces to more reasonable dimensions met with stubborn\r\nopposition. Whenever troops were disbanded they showed no tendency to\r\nreturn to useful occupations: the ex-soldiers desired only to continue\r\nto live upon the country, and, no longer serving the established\r\nauthority, they joined bandit gangs, rendering the interior of the\r\nmajority of the provinces insecure.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the army was strikingly demonstrated whenever an\r\nattempt was made to use it to defend the country against either\r\nexternal or internal enemies. In the campaign against the Mongols, the\r\nChinese troops had failed entirely; even within the country itself,\r\nthis huge army was not able to insure the fulfilment of that first\r\nduty of a government--the protection of the lives and property of its\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nIn the provinces of Honan and Hupei brigands, led by a person known as\r\n\"White Wolf,\" had for months been terrifying the population; ravaging\r\nthe countryside; sacking walled cities; murdering and outraging the\r\npopulation; and in a number of instances had killed foreigners. Thus\r\nfar the army had been powerless to suppress these brigands; in fact,\r\nevidence was at hand that the troops had repeatedly been so lax and\r\nremiss that the only explanation of their conduct would seem to lie in\r\na secret connivance at the brigandage, and lack of coöperation among\r\nthe commanders of the troops.\r\n\r\nAs the authority of the Central Government was commensurate with its\r\ncontrol over the tutuhs (tuchuns), or military governors, the attitude\r\nof the latter toward the President had to be carefully watched; and it\r\nwas causing no small uneasiness that there did not seem to be perfect\r\nagreement among these pillars of authority in the various provinces;\r\nthus, friction had recently been reported between General Tuan\r\nChi-jui, the Minister of War, who was the acting tutuh of Hupei, and\r\nGeneral Feng Kuo-chang, the tutuh of Kiangsu, two of the most powerful\r\nsupporters of the President.\r\n\r\nNone of the provinces of China, during the preceding three months, had\r\nbeen free from brigandage, attempted rebellion, troubles resulting from\r\nthe disbanding of troops, and local riots. Conditions were worst in the\r\nprovinces of Honan and Hupei, in which the bands of \"White Wolf\" are\r\noperating.\r\n\r\nThese bands had assumed a distinctly anti-foreign attitude. In\r\nKansu there were constant Mohammedan uprisings, related to the open\r\nrebellion in Tibet and Mongolia. Bandit movements had also occurred\r\nin the provinces of Shansi, Shensi, Szechuan (super-added to revolts\r\nof the troops), Anhui, Kiangsi, Hunan, Fukien, Kweichow, Yunnan, and\r\nKwangtung. Chekiang, Kwangsi, Shantung, and Chihli had been the least\r\nmolested.\r\n\r\nWhile the Government had been unable to fulfil its duty of protecting\r\nthe lives and property of its citizens, it was also unable to exercise\r\nthe elementary power of providing, through taxation, the means for its\r\nown support. The maintenance of the army had eaten up the available\r\nmeans and it had not been possible to secure sufficient money from\r\nthe provinces to meet the ordinary running expenses of the Central\r\nGovernment. The remarkable resisting power of China is illustrated\r\nby the fact that, notwithstanding the conditions of rebellion and\r\npolitical unrest which characterized the year 1913, general commerce\r\nremained so active that the collections of the Customs and of the\r\nSalt Gabelle exceeded those of any previous year. These two sources\r\nof revenue were sufficient to provide for the interest payments and\r\namortization of the long-term foreign loans then contracted; their\r\nadministration, under foreign control, had secured to the Central\r\nGovernment the funds to meet these obligations and to avoid open\r\nbankruptcy.\r\n\r\nAll other forms of taxation were disorganized. The collection of the\r\nland tax was in many places discontinued; records had been destroyed,\r\nor the population took an attitude hostile to its collection. The\r\nproceeds of the _likin_, as far as collected, were retained for\r\nprovincial use. Altogether, the Central Government received from the\r\nprovinces not more than 10 per cent. of the estimated income from these\r\nsources under the last Imperial Budget for 1912.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Central Government had been living from hand to mouth,\r\nusing the proceeds of foreign loans for administrative purposes, and\r\nwas kept going by taking cash advances upon foreign loan contracts made\r\nfor furnishing materials and for various concessions. In this way the\r\nfuture had been discounted to a dangerous extent.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the financial administration of the Government was\r\nfound in all other branches of its activities. There was little\r\nevidence of constructive capacity.\r\n\r\nIn the ministries and departments of the Central Government the\r\ngreatest disorganization was apparent. In dealing with technical\r\nquestions the officials were often entirely at sea, not being trained\r\nthemselves in these matters, nor willing to make real use of the many\r\nadvisers who were engaged by the Government; there was no adequate\r\nsystem of accounting; the departmental records were not well kept;\r\nfrequently the existence of a transaction was not known to the\r\nofficials most nearly concerned; past transactions, fully consummated,\r\nhad been forgotten; there was no centralization of governmental\r\nknowledge; so a great deal of the public business was transacted in a\r\nhaphazard way, leading to a helpless opportunism of doing the things\r\nmost strongly urged and of grasping at small immediate advantages at\r\nthe cost of engagements long to be regretted.\r\n\r\nAmbitious schemes of general policy had been brought up, and elaborate\r\nregulations promulgated, to all of which little attention was\r\nsubsequently paid. On the other hand, there had scarcely been one\r\nsingle concrete result obtained in constructive work.\r\n\r\nThe metropolitan Province of Chihli had been quiet and peaceful since\r\nthe outbreak of 1912. The Government here certainly had sufficient\r\nauthority to introduce constructive reforms, and the general conditions\r\nfor such action in this province had been relatively most favourable.\r\nBut not even in the case of Chihli Province had the taxation system\r\nbeen rendered efficient; no efficient auditing methods had been\r\nintroduced in practice, although systems of auditing control had been\r\npromulgated; educational institutions had been allowed to run down: in\r\nshort, under the most favourable conditions, no constructive work had\r\nbeen accomplished.\r\n\r\nNearly all attempts to do something of a constructive nature had been\r\nimmediately associated with foreign loans, often involving a cash\r\nadvance to the Government. It might, of course, be said that the great\r\ndifficulty of the Chinese Government was exactly that it lacked the\r\nfunds for carrying out constructive work; and that, therefore, only\r\nsuch lines of improvement could be followed for which it had been\r\npossible to secure foreign loans.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was only partly true. A great many reforms could have\r\nbeen accomplished without the increase of expenditure; indeed, they\r\nwould have resulted in a reduction of outlay. The fact seemed to be\r\nthat the Central Government, realizing how important foreign financial\r\nsupport had been to it during the Revolution of 1913, was anxious to\r\nsecure more and more funds from abroad without counting the ultimate\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity for obtaining from abroad large sums of money, far\r\nbeyond any amount ever before dealt with by Chinese officials and\r\nmerchants, in itself had an unsettling effect upon methods of public\r\nbusiness. The old caution and economy, which kept the public debt\r\nwithin narrow limits, had given way to a readiness to obtain funds\r\nfrom abroad in enormous amounts, without apparently the realization\r\nof the burden imposed upon China by way of the necessity of return in\r\nthe future through the results of labour and sacrifice of millions of\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nNor had the old system, under which the inadequate salaries of\r\nofficials had ordinarily to be supplemented by extraneous illicit\r\ngains, given way to a more efficient and business-like organization of\r\nthe public service under which officials would be able to devote their\r\nundivided attention to the accomplishment of their regular allotted\r\ntasks without spending their energy in contriving additional means of\r\nobtaining income.\r\n\r\nIn the case of certain classes of officials, the Government had\r\nendeavoured to place their salaries at a figure sufficient to render\r\nthem independent of these practices; but the resources of the\r\nGovernment were not adequate to enable it at once to place the entire\r\npublic service upon a basis of individual independence. It was also\r\ntrue that certain among the closest advisers of the President were\r\ncommonly believed to have used their positions for the purpose of\r\naccumulating vast private fortunes--a belief which, whether justified\r\nor not, must be counted with in determining the standing of the\r\nGovernment as enjoyed throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThus the old hostility and lack of confidence, which formerly\r\ncharacterized the relations between merchants and officials, continued\r\nunder the new system.\r\n\r\nThrough the dissolution of the Parliament, the Government had destroyed\r\nan organ which might, in the course of time, have established relations\r\nof confidence between the great middle class of China and the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAs a statesman, the President emphasized in the first place the\r\nrequirements of order and of authority. To him it seemed that\r\nParliament, with its free discussion, with its opportunity for forming\r\npolitical factions, opposing the men in authority, stood in the way of\r\nthe establishment of a lasting system of legal order. He, therefore,\r\ndissolved first the national parliament, then the assemblies of the\r\nprovinces, and finally the local self-governing bodies.\r\n\r\nIn each case inefficiency was justly complained of. The men in\r\nthe parliamentary bodies had often been self-seeking, factional,\r\nand unpractical. But the President seemed to have no perception\r\nof the true value of parliamentary action as a basis of public\r\nauthority; he considered opposition to the Government synonymous\r\nwith opposition to lawful authority. And in his ideas upon the\r\nreconstitution of Parliament, as far as they had been announced, two\r\nmain principles dominated: first, that only men of mature experience\r\nand of conservative ideas should be selected; and secondly, that the\r\nactivities of Parliament should be confined to discussing and giving\r\nadvice upon policies already determined upon by the Administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCHINA OF MERCHANT-ADVENTURERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe past may become in the human present more alive than ever. John\r\nRichard Green finds in the old records of the guilds of Berwick an\r\nenactment \"that where many bodies are found side by side in one place\r\nthey may become one, and have one will, and in the dealings of one\r\nwith another have a strong and hearty love.\" In the history of the\r\nSaxons, Edwin of Northumbria \"caused stakes to be fixed in the highways\r\nwhere he had seen a clear spring,\" and \"brazen dishes were chained to\r\nthem, to refresh the weary sojourner, whose fatigues Edwin had himself\r\nexperienced.\" These things shine with the sun, and enlighten our work\r\nto-day. The Maine woodsman sits on a stump whose rings number centuries\r\nof growth. When Chinese children came to play with our children at the\r\nLegation, I was always impressed by their dignity of demeanour and\r\ntheir observance of the courtesies while their elders were present.\r\nOn the faces of these little heirs of the Holy Duke the composure of\r\neighty generations of culture and traditions sat freshly; and it by no\r\nmeans alloyed their delight, which was unstinted, in American toys and\r\ndolls.\r\n\r\nThis transmutation of the old into new life is seen everywhere in\r\nChina. The day comes every morning fresh as a flower. But we know it\r\nis old; it is an ancient day, white-clad and beautiful as the stars.\r\nThe Chinese peasant thrusts his stick of a plough many eons deep into\r\nhis ancestral soil. In north China it is loess soil, the most fertile\r\non the globe, brought down from the mountains for millenniums and\r\ndeposited to depths of from twenty to thirty feet. When there are no\r\nfloods the rain sinks deeply into this porous soil, meets the moisture\r\nretained below, and draws up therefrom the inorganic salts that are\r\nheld dissolved. So its fertility is inexhaustible.\r\n\r\nBut floods do come, as they have come unchecked for ages. In the Hwai\r\nRiver region, with all this natural richness underfoot, the people are\r\npoor, weak, famine-stricken, living in aggregations of shabby hovels\r\nthat are periodically swept away. Its crops, which should normally\r\nbe six in three years, average but two and three. This region is\r\nonly one example of several prodigious and extensive valleys choked\r\nwith fertility, yet with famine and pestilence raging through them,\r\ncursed as they are by inundations that might be completely checked\r\nat little engineering cost. With these regions reclaimed and the\r\nborder provinces colonized, China's crops alone would support double\r\nher present population. The people of the Hwai region, secure and\r\naffluent, might be easily increased by twenty million living heirs\r\nof a fifty-centuries-old civilization. Indeed, a little vision and\r\nscientific application would transform China.\r\n\r\nWith what the ages have produced for the West--the old guild spirit\r\nreviving, if you please, in the modern trust--the West can meet\r\nthe East. The true ministers and ambassadors to China are the\r\nmerchant-adventurers of the Western nations, bearing their goods, their\r\nsteel and tools, their unique engineering skill and works. It was not\r\nfor what the _entrepreneurs_ \"could get out of\" China, nor yet for\r\nwhat China could get out of us, that my policy as American minister\r\nwas directed to this complementary meeting of two civilizations. It\r\nwas because I saw millions perishing wretchedly whose birthright in\r\nthe higher arts and amenities of living is at least as rich as our\r\nown--perishing for lack of an organizing skill which it is the province\r\nof the Western peoples to supply. It was because I knew, with their\r\nadmirable family life and local democratic institutions, it needed\r\nonly trunk-line railways to link together these close-set communities,\r\ncomprising one quarter of the earth's population, into as admirable a\r\ncentral democracy.\r\n\r\nBut how the West was then meeting the East came home to me on the\r\nsecond morning of my stay in Peking. I entered the breakfast room,\r\nwhere I found Doctor Hornbeck in a state of annoyance. He handed me the\r\nmorning copy of the _Journal de Peking_, a sheet published in French\r\nand known to be subservient to Russian and French political interests\r\nfrom which it got subventions. The article in question was a scurrilous\r\nattack on me personally, and on American action in China generally.\r\n\r\nA Chinese journal in Shanghai had published a laudatory article\r\nin which had been cited extracts from my published books. One of\r\nthese, taken from \"World Politics,\" had happened to speak of French\r\nsubserviency to Russian policy in the Far East. The French journal\r\nrepeated these expressions as if they had been given out by me in an\r\ninterview upon arriving in China. As they were in fact taken from books\r\npublished more than ten years before, which had run the gauntlet of\r\nFrench critical journals without ever having been taken as hostile to\r\nFrance, I did not have any reason to worry, and the fume and fury of\r\nthe local journal rather amused me than otherwise. I could, however,\r\nnot help noting the temper of these attacks, their bitterness and the\r\nutter rashness and lack of inquiry with which the charges were made.\r\nIt gave me early warning, considering its gross lack of courtesy to a\r\nnewcomer, who had entered the field in a spirit friendly to all, as to\r\nwhat might be expected from some of our friendly rivals. When several\r\nyears later one of the ministers whose legation stood sponsor for this\r\nsheet approached me with a request to use my influence to suppress a\r\nChinese paper which had attacked him, I regretted that it was not in my\r\npower to be of assistance.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the article lay of course in its attack upon\r\nAmerican policy, which was characterized as one of \"bluff\", and which\r\ncharged the United States with assuming a tone of superior virtue\r\nin criticising others, and, while loudly professing friendship for\r\nthe Chinese, failing to shoulder any part of the responsibility in\r\nactual affairs. The Y.M.C.A. and the Standard Oil Company were coupled\r\ntogether as twin instruments of a nefarious and hypocritical policy.\r\n\r\nThe _China Press_, the American newspaper of Shanghai, pointed out that\r\nthe attack of the French paper indicated what the American minister\r\nwould have to face, and observed that the success or failure of his\r\ndiplomatic mission must depend upon the readiness of the American\r\nGovernment to take an active part in the rehabilitation of China.\r\nShould America play the rôle of an altruistic but impotent friend,\r\nand of a captious critic of the other powers, it could gain neither\r\nsympathy nor respect.\r\n\r\nThe American Government was at this time severely criticised for\r\nits failure to endorse the Six-Power Consortium; it was urged that\r\nthe Administration had sacrificed the best opportunity for bringing\r\nAmerican goodwill to bear on Chinese public affairs, by exercising\r\na moderating and friendly influence in the council of the great\r\npowers. On the other hand, it ought to be considered that a new\r\nadministration, when confronted with the sudden proposal that it\r\ngive _exclusive_ support to one special group of banks, might well\r\nhesitate, particularly in view of the fact that the group in this case\r\nconsisted of only four New York houses. An earlier administration had\r\nanswered such an inquiry in a similar way. Considering the merits\r\nof the question from the point of view of China, the action might\r\npresent itself in the light of a refusal to join with others in placing\r\nupon the young republic the fetters of foreign financial control.\r\nMoreover, the proceeds of the Reorganization Loan were actually not\r\nused for the benefit of the Chinese people, but on the contrary this\r\nfinancial support fastened the personal authority of Yuan Shih-kai\r\non the country and enabled him to carry on a successful fight against\r\nparliament. That body never gave its approval to the loan.\r\n\r\nFrom my conversations with President Wilson before departing for my\r\npost I had formed the conclusion that the President realized that\r\nas America had withdrawn from a coöperative effort to assist in the\r\ndevelopment of China, it was incumbent upon her to do her share\r\nindependently and to give specific moral and financial assistance;\r\nin fact, I received the President's assurance of active support for\r\nconstructive work in China. In his conversation he dwelt, however,\r\nmore on the educational side and on political example and moral\r\nencouragement, than on the matter of finance and commerce.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that in China the withdrawal of the United\r\nStates from the Consortium was interpreted as an act of friendship\r\nby all groups with the exception of that which was in control of the\r\nGovernment at the time, which would have preferred to have the United\r\nStates at the council table of the Consortium Powers. Those opposed\r\nto the Government were particularly strong in their commendation of\r\nour refusal to join in an agreement which to them seemed far from\r\nbeneficial to China. But all parties without exception drew the\r\nconclusion that the friendly action of the United States, which had\r\nnow rejected the method of international coöperation, would continue\r\nindependently of the others. In view of the power and resources of the\r\nUnited States, it was hoped that there would be a greater participation\r\nby the United States in Chinese industrial and commercial affairs, as\r\nwell as in administrative loans, than had hitherto existed.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from all this that the American position in China\r\nwas not free from difficulties. The covert antagonism of the five\r\nConsortium Powers was continuous. We were isolated, and would be judged\r\nby what we could do by ourselves. Should it turn out that we had\r\nnothing to offer but sage advice, the strictures of our rivals might\r\nin time come to carry a certain amount of conviction.\r\n\r\nSo far as the Americans themselves were concerned, they were thoroughly\r\ndiscouraged, and everywhere talked as if it were all up with American\r\nenterprise in China. When I said: \"No, it is only just beginning,\"\r\npolite incredulity was the best I could expect. It is very probable\r\nthat the Americans who were so downcast saw in the appointment of\r\na literary and university man as minister to China an additional\r\nindication that there was to be no special encouragement given to\r\nAmerican economic enterprise. Having long been familiar with the\r\nunderlying facts of the Far Eastern situation, I had entirely made\r\nup my mind on the primary importance of American participation in\r\nthe industrial and economic development of China. No one could have\r\nappreciated more highly than I did the important work done by American\r\nmissionaries, teachers, and medical men, in bringing to China a\r\nconception of Western learning and life. But if China should have\r\nto rely entirely on other nations for active support in the modern\r\ndevelopment of her industries and resources, then our position in the\r\neyes of the Chinese nation could never come up to the opportunities\r\nwhich Nature had given us through our geographic position and our\r\nindustrial strength.\r\n\r\nI had long discarded any narrow interpretation of diplomacy, but even\r\nif I had adhered to the principle that the diplomat must busy himself\r\nonly with political matters, I should have had to admit that in China\r\npolitical matters included commerce, finance, and industry. I did not,\r\nof course, intend that the Legation should enter into a scramble for\r\nconcessions, but it was my purpose that it should maintain sympathetic\r\ncontact with Americans active in the economic life of China, and should\r\nsee to it that the desire of the Chinese to give them fair treatment\r\nshould not be defeated from any other source.\r\n\r\nWhen I thought of American enterprise in China I had less in mind the\r\nmaking of government contracts, than the gaining of the confidence of\r\nthe Chinese people in the various provincial centres of enterprise\r\nby extensive business undertakings, resting on a sound and broad\r\nfoundation. In China the people are vastly more important than the\r\nGovernment, so that it is necessary to make up one's mind from the\r\nstart not to regard Peking as the end-all and be-all of one's activity,\r\nbut to interest one's self deeply in what is going on in all of those\r\nimportant interior centres where the real power of government over the\r\npeople is exercised, and where the active organizations of the people\r\nare located.\r\n\r\nThe universal knowledge that America has no political aims in China, of\r\nitself gives Americans the confidence of the Chinese and predisposes\r\nthe latter to favour intimate coöperation. Our policy is known to be\r\nconstructive and not to imply insidious dangers to their national life.\r\nIt would be discouraging to the Chinese, should Americans fail to take\r\na prominent part in the development of Chinese resources. To Americans\r\nthe idea of securing preëminence or predominance is foreign, but from\r\nthe very nature of their purely economic interest they have to resist\r\nany attempt on the part of others to get exclusive rights or a position\r\nof predominance, which could be utilized to restrict, or entirely to\r\nextinguish, American opportunities.\r\n\r\nI was therefore resolved to give every legitimate encouragement to\r\nconstructive enterprise, whether it were in education, finance,\r\ncommerce, or industry.[1] Fully a year before going to China I had\r\nexpressed my view of the nature of American policy there, saying that\r\na united China, master of its own land, developing its resources, open\r\nto all nations of the world equally for commercial and industrial\r\nactivity, should be the chief desideratum.\r\n\r\nAmong the specific American interests already existing in China, that\r\nof missionary and educational work had at this time to be given the\r\nfirst rank. There are two factors which have made it possible for this\r\nwork to achieve a really notable influence. The one is that it is\r\nplainly the result of individual impulse on the part of a great many\r\npeople animated by friendly motives, and not the result of a concerted\r\nplan of propaganda. The second factor is the spirit of helpfulness and\r\ncoöperation which permeates this work. There is no trace of a desire to\r\nestablish a permanent tutelage. An institution like the Y.M.C.A. acts\r\nwith the sole thought of helping the Chinese to a better organization\r\nof their own social and educational life. The sooner they are able\r\nto manage for themselves, the better it seems to please the American\r\nteachers, who may remain for a while as friendly counsellors, but who\r\nmake no effort to set up a permanent hierarchy of supervision. The\r\nChinese have an intense respect for their educators, and it has been\r\nthe good fortune of many Americans--men like Dr. W.A.P. Martin and Dr.\r\nChas. D. Tenney--to win the devoted loyalty of innumerable Chinese\r\nthrough their activity as teachers.\r\n\r\nAmong commercial enterprises the Standard Oil Company was carrying\r\npetroleum to all parts of China. It had introduced the use of the\r\npetroleum lamp, had extended the length of the day to the hundreds\r\nof millions of Chinese, and even its emptied tin cans had become\r\nubiquitous in town and country, because of the manifold uses to which\r\nthese receptacles could be put. For efficiency and close contact with\r\nthe people, the Chinese organization of this great company was indeed\r\nadmirable.\r\n\r\nA similar result had been obtained by the British-American Tobacco\r\nCompany, which, although organized in England under British law, is\r\nAmerican by majority ownership, business methods, and personnel.\r\nThe cigarette had been made of universal use, and had been adapted\r\nto the taste and purchasing ability of the masses. Though there\r\nwere several American commission firms of good standing, none had\r\nthe extensive trade and financial importance of the great British\r\nhouses. Several American firm names established in China early in the\r\nnineteenth century, like that of Frazar & Company, had become British\r\nin ownership. The only American bank was the International Banking\r\nCorporation, which at this time confined itself to exchange business\r\nand did not differ in its policy or operations from the common run of\r\ntreaty port banks.\r\n\r\nIf national standing in China were to be determined by the holding\r\nof government concessions, America was at this time, indeed, poorly\r\nequipped. The Bethlehem Steel Corporation had in 1910 concluded a\r\ncontract with the Imperial Government for the construction of vessels\r\nto the value of $20,000,000. When I came to China, a vice-president\r\nof the corporation, Mr. Archibald Johnston, was in Peking, ready\r\nto arrange with the republican government for a continuance of the\r\ncontract. The American banking group was a partner in the Hukuang\r\nRailways, in which it shared with the British, French, and German\r\ngroups. An American engineer was employed at the time in making a\r\nsurvey of a portion of the proposed line along the Yangtse River. The\r\nAmerican group also held the concession for the Chinchow-Aigun Railway\r\nin Manchuria, the execution of which had been blocked by Russia and\r\nJapan. The group further participated with the three other groups above\r\nmentioned in the option for a currency loan. The only activity going on\r\nat this time in connection with these various contracts, on the part of\r\nAmerica, was the survey of the Hukuang railway line west of Ichang.\r\n\r\nFor some time the practice had grown up, on the part of European\r\npowers, to urge the Chinese to employ, as advisers, men reputed to have\r\nexpert knowledge in certain fields. The most noted adviser at this time\r\nwas Dr. George Morrison, who had gained a reputation in interpreting\r\nFar Eastern affairs as Peking correspondent for the London _Times_\r\nduring and after the critical period of 1900. A fresh group of advisers\r\nhad just been added under the terms of the Reorganization Loan. Each\r\npower therein represented had insisted that the Chinese appoint at\r\nleast one of its nationals as an adviser. The American Government had\r\nnever urged China to make such an appointment. But when President Eliot\r\nvisited China in 1913, Chinese officials expressed to him the wish\r\nthat a prominent American should be retained as adviser to the Chinese\r\nGovernment. President Eliot suggested that the Carnegie Endowment might\r\npropose certain experts from whom the Chinese Government could then\r\nmake a selection. This method was actually followed, and as a result\r\nProf. F.J. Goodnow of Columbia University, a recognized authority\r\non constitutional law, had been retained by the Chinese Government\r\nand was at this time already in residence at Peking. The Ministry of\r\nCommunications on its part had sought a man familiar with railway\r\naccounting, and had called upon the late Prof. Henry C. Adams, the\r\nnoted economist and railway expert of Michigan University.\r\n\r\nThe important administrative positions of Inspector General of Customs\r\nand of Foreign Inspector of the Salt Revenue were held by two British\r\nofficials. The salt administration had come within the purview of\r\ninternational supervision through the Reorganization Loan agreement;\r\nand, as America was not a party to that loan, the appointment of\r\nAmericans to any positions in this service was frowned upon by several\r\nof the partners. The Inspector, Sir Richard Dane, an official of long\r\nexperience in India, however, adopted the policy of not confining the\r\nappointments to subjects of the Consortium Powers. He had retained\r\nseveral Americans, in whom he seemed to place great confidence. In the\r\nCustoms Service, Americans did not hold the number of positions to\r\nwhich they were relatively entitled. This was undoubtedly due to the\r\nfact that very few people in the United States knew that such positions\r\nin China are open to Americans; moreover, many of those Americans\r\nwho were actually appointed had become impatient with the relatively\r\nslow advancement in this service and had been attracted by other\r\nopportunities. There were, however, a number of highly reputed and\r\nefficient American officials in the Customs Service.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The leading British paper of China had this to say\r\nconcerning the modern functions of diplomacy: \"It is characteristic of\r\nDoctor Reinsch and his outlook upon China that he should mark a point\r\nof progress in the fact that the legations are ceasing to be merely\r\npolitical centres, and that, instead of politics being the one and only\r\nobject of their existence, they are now establishing relations of all\r\nkinds of mutual helpfulness in vital phases of national reorganization.\r\nIn this connection, we may see an increase in the number of experts\r\nwho will come, unofficially for the most part, to study conditions and\r\ngather data which may be available as a sure foundation for progress.\"\r\nI may say in passing that the British papers in China, throughout the\r\nperiod of my work there, were almost uniformly fair and friendly, and\r\ngave credit for honest efforts to improve conditions.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPROMPT PROPOSALS FOR AMERICAN ACTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chinese were not slow in showing what conclusions they deduced\r\nfrom the withdrawal of the American Government from the Six-Power\r\nConsortium. On November 27th, two cabinet ministers called on me for\r\na private conversation. Following this interview Mr. Chang Chien,\r\nrecognized master of antique Chinese learning, but also Minister of\r\nIndustries and Commerce, came to me. I will relate the substance of\r\nwhat passed on these two occasions, beginning with Mr. Chang.\r\n\r\nChang Chien carried off first honours in the great metropolitan\r\nexaminations of Peking under the old régime in 1899. He is a scholar\r\n_par excellence_ of the Chinese classics, and his chirography is so\r\nfamous that he has been able to support a college out of the proceeds\r\nof a sale of examples of his writing. But he has not rested satisfied\r\nwith the ancient learning. In the region of his home, Nan Tung-chow, on\r\nthe banks of the Yangtse, he has established schools, factories, and\r\nexperiment stations for the improvement of agriculture and industry.\r\nHe had financial reverses. People at this time still doubted whether\r\nhe would be permanently successful, although they admitted that he\r\nhad given impetus to many improvements. Since then his enterprises\r\nhave flourished and multiplied. He has become a great national figure,\r\nwhose words, spoken from an honest desire for right public action,\r\nhave decisive weight with the nation. While he still represents the\r\nold belief that the superior man of perfect literary training should\r\nbe able successfully to undertake any enterprise and to solve any\r\npractical difficulty--which belief is contrary to the demands of our\r\ncomplex modern life for specialization--yet he has succeeded in bending\r\nhis intelligence to thoroughly modern tasks.\r\n\r\nAs would be expected from his high culture as a Chinese scholar,\r\nMr. Chang Chien is a man of refinement and distinction of manners,\r\nthan which nothing could be more considerate and more dignified. The\r\nChinese are exceedingly sensitive to the thought and feeling of any\r\none in whose company they happen to be; if their host is busy or\r\npreoccupied, no matter how politely he may receive them, they will\r\nnevertheless sense his difficulty and will cut their visit short. They\r\nalso have great tact in turning a conversation or avoiding discussions\r\nthey are not ready for, and they can do this in a manner which makes\r\nit impossible to force a discussion without impolite insistence.\r\nThe smoothness and velvetiness of Chinese manners, together with\r\nthe absence of all servile assent and the maintenance of complete\r\nindependence of discussion, are marvellous and bear evidence to\r\nthousands of years of social training.\r\n\r\nMr. Chang Chien was particularly interested in river and harbour\r\ndevelopment, and in plans for the drainage of those regions of\r\nChina which are subject to periodical floods. It was contemplated\r\nto establish a special conservancy bureau under whose care surveys\r\nfor important projects were to be undertaken. I questioned Mr. Chang\r\nconcerning the status of the Hwai River conservancy scheme for the\r\nprevention of floods in the northern portion of the provinces of\r\nKiangsu and Anhui, the region from which he came.\r\n\r\n\"I have already established a special engineering school,\" he replied,\r\n\"in order to train men for this work. A large part of the survey has\r\nbeen made, and it can be entirely completed by a further expenditure of\r\n35,000 taels.\r\n\r\n\"Besides the enormous benefit of such a work to all the adjoining\r\nagricultural lands,\" he continued, \"there would be reclaimed nearly\r\n3,000,000 acres which could now not be used at all, although their soil\r\nis inexhaustibly fertile. The land thus reclaimed would be salable\r\nimmediately for at least $40 an acre. Would not this alone be ample\r\nsecurity for a large conservancy loan? $25,000,000 would do the work.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chang was also interested in the establishment of a commercial and\r\nindustrial bank, in copartnership with American capitalists. \"Such a\r\nbank,\" he said, \"would assist in furnishing the capital for the works\r\nof internal improvement.\"\r\n\r\nIt was quite plain that Mr. Chang looked upon a bank as an institution\r\nwhich would invest its capital in such enterprises--a conception which\r\nwas then quite current among the Chinese. They had not yet fully\r\nrealized that in the modern organization of credit a bank may act as a\r\ndepository and may make temporary loans, but more permanent investments\r\nmust ultimately be placed with individual capitalists, with banks\r\nacting only as underwriting and selling agencies.\r\n\r\nAs we talked about the execution of these large and useful projects,\r\nMr. Chang repeatedly made expressions such as this: \"I prefer American\r\ncoöperation. I am ready to employ American experts to work out the\r\nplans and to act as supervisors. But please to bear in mind, these\r\nworks may not be undertaken without raising a large part of the needed\r\nfunds in the United States or in other countries.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the two cabinet ministers called they brought no interpreter. \"The\r\nmatters about which we wish to talk,\" they said, \"are so important that\r\nwe wish to keep the discussion confined to as few persons as possible.\r\nWe bring the ideas of President Yuan Shih-kai and his government with\r\nrespect to what Americans might do in China.\"\r\n\r\nThey first gave me a review of the recent development of the\r\nRusso-Japanese entente with respect to Manchuria and Mongolia. They\r\nexpressed their belief that an understanding existed between these\r\npowers to treat outer Mongolia as a region within which Russian\r\ncontrol should not be obstructed, and, _vice versa_, to allow a free\r\nhand to Japan, not only in southern Manchuria, but also in eastern\r\nMongolia. Continuous activity of the Japanese in south China, in\r\nstirring up opposition to the Central Government, indicated a desire\r\nto weaken China, and, if possible, to divide it against itself. The\r\nextraordinary efforts made by Japan to increase her naval establishment\r\nwere also particularly mentioned. The impression their discourse\r\nconveyed was that Japan was engaged in a strong forward policy in\r\nChina, and that in this she had the countenance and support of Russia.\r\n\r\nMy visitors then passed on to the reasons why the Chinese entertained\r\nthe hope that America would give them its moral support to the extent\r\nof opposing the inroads made by Japan and Russia, and of coöperating\r\nwith Great Britain and other powers favourable to the Open Door policy\r\nin preventing attempts to break up the Chinese Republic. They fully\r\nrealized the improbability of an alliance between China and the United\r\nStates, but laid stress on the parallel interests of the two countries,\r\nand particularly on the sympathy engendered through following the\r\nprinciples of democratic government. Having become a republic, the\r\nChinese Government is brought into peculiarly close relationship to\r\nthe United States; it sees in the United States its most sincere and\r\nunselfish friend, and realizes the importance of American moral support.\r\n\r\nDescending to particulars, the ministers pointed out that while China\r\nappreciated and valued the friendly interest and counsel of the United\r\nStates, it was disappointing that so very little had been done by\r\nAmerica, while the European Powers and Japan should have taken such a\r\nvery important part in the development of the resources of China. They\r\nsaid that the Chinese Government and people were desirous of affording\r\nthe Americans unusual opportunities, should they be ready to coöperate.\r\n\r\nTaking up specific enterprises, they stated that the Government was\r\nquite willing to ratify and carry out the contract made in 1910 by\r\nthe Imperial Government with the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. Under\r\nthis contract they intended to build vessels adapted for commercial\r\npurposes, but convertible into warships somewhat like the vessels of\r\nthe Russian Volunteer Fleet. The establishment of a steamship line to\r\nthe United States, directly or by way of the Panama Canal, was greatly\r\ndesired by the Government.\r\n\r\nIt was recalled that at the time the naval mission of Prince Tsao\r\nvisited the United States, the matter of lending American experts\r\nas instructors for the Chinese navy came up for discussion, and\r\nsuch assistance was promised by the American Administration under\r\nPresident Taft. The assistance contemplated was to be instructional and\r\ntechnical, not involving matters of policy or suggesting a political\r\nalliance, and of a nature such as had been in the past given by other\r\nnations, particularly Great Britain. The ministers stated that the\r\nChinese Government still intended to avail itself of this assistance\r\nshould the need for it arise, and that American coöperation in a matter\r\nlike this was preferred because of the political disinterestedness of\r\nthe American Government.\r\n\r\nThe ministers then took up more purely industrial enterprises, and\r\ndwelt particularly on plans for river and harbour improvement,\r\nmentioning the Hwai River region and other districts where agricultural\r\npursuits are interrupted by destructive floods. As the Central\r\nGovernment contemplated the establishment of a national bureau to\r\nprovide for these matters, the ministers suggested that the American\r\nGovernment would be invited to give its assistance by lending experts\r\nto plan and conduct the proposed works. They expressed their belief\r\nthat the experience of Americans in such enterprises had qualified them\r\nabove any other nation for coping with these problems of China.\r\n\r\nOther matters were taken up, such as the possible creation of a\r\ntobacco monopoly, from which the ministers expected both increased\r\nrevenue and a more effective organization of tobacco production\r\nthroughout China. It was not their desire to oust the British-American\r\nTobacco Company, but they suggested that an arrangement would be made\r\nwhereby this company might act as the selling agent of the Chinese\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAnother subject was the exploration of China for petroleum. They stated\r\nthat the Government wished that the development of oil fields should\r\nbe undertaken. On account of the manner in which some other nations\r\nwere wont to extend the scope of any concessions of this kind so as\r\nto establish general claims of preference, particularly as to railway\r\nrights, the Government much preferred to take up this matter with\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nIt was apparent that these men entertained high hopes of American\r\nactivity in China, and that they were ready to do their part in making\r\nthe conditions favourable. Their minds were alive with plans of\r\ndevelopment. Both because of American experience with similar problems\r\nand of the American spirit of fairness, they believed that great\r\nbenefit would result if Americans were to become prominently active\r\nin the vast industrial transformation which they anticipated in the\r\nimmediate future.\r\n\r\nAs this conversation passed from topic to topic, touching on proposals\r\nof moment, I could not but feel that a new spirit had surely arisen\r\nin China. It would have been inconceivable under the old régime for\r\nhigh officials, trained in the traditional formalism and reticent\r\nwith inherited distrust of the foreigner, to approach a foreign\r\nrepresentative thus frankly, laying before him concrete proposals for\r\njoint action. In the past, as we know, it was the foreigners who had\r\ndesired changes and new enterprises and who had in and out of season\r\npressed them upon the reluctant and inert Chinese officials. But here\r\nwere men who realized that it is the function of the Government to\r\nplan and to initiate; and they were ready to go to any length in making\r\nadvances to a country in whose motives they had full confidence.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to be fascinated by the prospects that were here\r\nunfolded. A country of vast resources in natural wealth, labour, power,\r\nand even in capital, was turning toward a new form of organization in\r\nwhich all these forces were to be made to work in larger units, over\r\ngreater areas and with more intensive methods than ever before. The\r\nmerely local point of view was giving way to the national outlook.\r\nNational resources and industries were looked at not from the point of\r\nview alone of any local group interested but of the unity of national\r\nlife and effort. To know that in this great task of reorganization,\r\nAmericans would be most welcome as associates and directors; that\r\nthey were spontaneously and sincerely desired in order that all these\r\nmaterials and resources might the more readily be built into a great\r\nand effective unity of national life--that, indeed, could not fail\r\nto be a cause for pride and gratification to an American. The only\r\ndisturbing thought was the question whether Americans were ready to\r\nappreciate the importance of the opportunity here offered. Yet there\r\ncould be no doubt that every energy must be applied in order to make\r\nthem realize the unprecedented nature of the opportunities and the\r\nimportance to America herself of the manner in which these materials\r\nwere to be organized so as to promote general human welfare rather than\r\nselfish exploitation and political ambition.\r\n\r\nThe Russian efforts to strengthen their position in Mongolia, to which\r\nthese two visitors had alluded, had at this time brought fruit in the\r\nform of an agreement with China to have the \"autonomy\" of Mongolia\r\nrecognized. A result and byplay of these negotiations came to the\r\nnotice of the foreign representatives in Peking at a meeting of the\r\ndiplomatic corps on December 11th. The meeting was at the British\r\nLegation, to which Sir John Jordan had by this time returned.\r\n\r\nThe head of the large establishment of the Russian Legation was a\r\nyoung man, Mr. Krupenski. Trained under some of the ablest diplomats\r\nof Russia and having spent many years in Peking as secretary, he had\r\nmanifestly not been selected by chance. With his English secretary\r\nhe occupied his vast house alone, being unmarried. He entertained\r\nbrilliantly, ably seconded therein by the Russo-Asiatic Bank across the\r\nway. Besides his thorough understanding of the Chinese, Mr. Krupenski\r\nhad a valuable quality in his ability to shed all the odium that\r\nmight attach to the policy of his government, as a duck sheds water.\r\nHe appeared at times greatly to enjoy mystifying his colleagues, to\r\njudge by his amused and unconcerned expression when he knew they were\r\nguessing as to what his last move might mean. Mr. Krupenski is tall,\r\nflorid, unmistakably Russian. During my first visit with him he plunged\r\n_in medias res_ concerning China. Though he probably wondered what move\r\nI might contemplate after the Manchurian proposals of Mr. Knox and\r\nAmerica's withdrawal from the Six-Power Group, he gave no hint of his\r\nfeelings, which undoubtedly did not contemplate me as likely to become\r\nan intimate associate in policies. When I left him I knew that here\r\nwas a man, surrounded by competent experts in finance, language, and\r\nlaw, who could play with the intricacies of Chinese affairs and take\r\nadvantage of opportunities and situations of which others would not\r\neven have an inkling.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of December 11th the Russian minister stated that he\r\ndesired to make an announcement, and proceeded to tell his colleagues\r\nquite blandly that his government had decided to withdraw the legation\r\nguards and other Russian troops from north China, and that they\r\nsuggested to the other governments to take similar action.\r\n\r\nThis announcement caused surprise all around the table. Questions came\r\nfrom all directions: \"Is this action to be immediate?\" \"What is the\r\npurpose of your government?\" \"What substitute for this protection do\r\nyou suggest?\" These and many more. The Russian minister seemed amused\r\nby the excitement he had caused. He allowed none of the questioners\r\nto worry him in the least, or to draw him out. With a quizzical and\r\nnon-committal smile he let the anxious surmises of his colleagues\r\nrun off his back. He shrugged his shoulders and said: \"These are the\r\ninstructions of my government. Their purpose--I do not know.\" When the\r\nmeeting adjourned, small groups walked off in different directions, all\r\nstill intently discussing the meaning of this move. So, the legation\r\nguards were really very important! The first question put to me in\r\nShanghai had related to them, and here I found the diplomatic corps\r\nthrown into excitement by the announcement that Russia was withdrawing\r\nher guard.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at the Legation, where Mrs. Reinsch was receiving and\r\nwhere visitors in large numbers were taking tea and dancing to the\r\nmusic of the marine band, the news had evidently already preceded me,\r\nfor several people asked me what had happened; and Putnam Weale and\r\nW.C. Donald, the British press representatives, were full of surmises.\r\nThe interpretation generally accepted was that the Russians, and\r\npossibly the Japanese, were trying to put the other powers in a hole;\r\nif they did not withdraw their legation guards they might displease the\r\nChinese Government, after what Russia had done; if they did withdraw\r\nthem, they would give an advantage to Russia and Japan, powers who, on\r\naccount of their proximity to China, could send large bodies of troops\r\nupon short notice.\r\n\r\nFrom the attitude of the diplomats it had been apparent that the\r\nproposal of the Russians would not prove acceptable. For weeks the\r\npress was filled with attempts to gauge the true bearing of the\r\nRussian proposal. Looked at from this distance after the Great War,\r\nit is hard to imagine how so relatively unimportant a matter could\r\ncause excitement. Of course, the removal of the legation guard was\r\nnot considered so important in itself, but it was of moment as an\r\nindication of what Russia might plan with respect to the further\r\nadvance of her influence in China.\r\n\r\nProbably Russia's action did not really contemplate any far-reaching\r\nconsequences. The Russians were urging the Chinese Government to\r\nmake an arrangement for Mongolian \"autonomy,\" which could not but\r\nbe intensely distasteful to the Chinese. The Russians had to offer\r\nsomething in return; with thorough knowledge of the old type of the\r\nChinese official mind, they selected something which would not cost\r\nthem anything, but which would be most gratifying to the Chinese\r\nGovernment. The Government looked upon the presence of foreign troops\r\nin Peking and in Chihli Province as incompatible with its dignity.\r\nTherefore, the Russian Government knew that through withdrawing its\r\ntroops and calling upon the other governments to do likewise, an\r\nopportunity would be given the Chinese Government to claim an important\r\nvictory, and the bitterness of renunciation with respect to Mongolia\r\nwould thus be somewhat tempered. Yuan Shih-kai and the Government as\r\nsuch would probably take that view; but the Chinese as individuals were\r\nnot likely thus to consider the presence of foreign troops an unmixed\r\nevil. These guards tended to stabilize the situation, also to prevent\r\nunconscionable acts or high-handed inroads by any individual powers. So\r\nfar as the people of China were concerned, Russia might not gather much\r\ncredit through this move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA LITTLE VISION FOR CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nI have said that a little vision and the application of American\r\nscientific methods would transform China. Chang Chien had instanced the\r\nHwai River valley, and the ease with which it might be made to bloom\r\nas the most fertile tract on the globe. China boasts the most skilled\r\nhorticulturists and truck-farmers of any nation, and they breed its\r\nthousands of species of vegetables and flowering plants and shrubs. It\r\nis said of the Chinese gardener, that if there is a sick or weakened\r\nplant, he \"listens and hears its cry,\" and nurses it into health like\r\na mother. But now the multitudes in the flood-ridden districts must\r\nperiodically expect the scarification of their gorgeous acres, the\r\nbearing away of their dwellings and loved ones on the remorseless\r\nfloods.\r\n\r\nAmericans had for some time been aware of the possibilities of\r\ndelivering from their curse these garden spots of earth. The American\r\nRed Cross, after giving $400,000 for relief of the severe famine in\r\n1911, was advised by its representatives how such calamities might be\r\nprevented, and it set an American engineer at making surveys in the\r\nHwai regions and suggesting suitable engineering works. Chang Chien,\r\nwith his native school of engineers, was also investigating the flood\r\nconditions, just about the time the American group of financiers left\r\nthe Six-Power Consortium. It might be expected that this American group\r\nwould be reluctant immediately to start further enterprises in China;\r\nindeed, that it might even discourage others from starting. Hence I\r\nthought it essential to propose only such undertakings as would come\r\nnaturally from past relationships or would help develop some American\r\ninterest already established in China. I was attracted by this plan,\r\nsound, useful, and meritorious, to redeem the Hwai River region.\r\n\r\nI found that the Chinese did not wish to take up this matter with any\r\nother nation than the United States, for they feared the territorial\r\nambitions of the other powers and their desire to establish \"spheres of\r\ninfluence\" in China. To send in engineers, to drain and irrigate, meant\r\nclose contacts; it might mean control over internal resources within\r\nthe regions affected, for by way of security the foreign creditor would\r\ndemand a mortgage upon the lands to be improved. Then there was the\r\nGrand Canal, a navigable watercourse, which would come within the scope\r\nof such works, and would give the foreign engineers and capitalists a\r\ndirect means of penetrating the interior. Jealous of foreign political\r\ncontrol in their domestic affairs, the Chinese were guarding their\r\nrights. But the American policy was traditionally non-aggressive, and I\r\nfound that to fair-minded Americans the Chinese would grant concessions\r\nwhich no other nation might hope to secure.\r\n\r\nI therefore asked through the Department of State what the American Red\r\nCross might continue to do. Would it take steps toward the choosing\r\nof a reputable and efficient American engineering firm and have this\r\nfirm supported by American capitalists, who might lend the Chinese\r\nGovernment the funds needed to reclaim the rich Hwai River region?\r\nThe Red Cross responded favourably. I thereupon sought out Mr. Chang\r\nChien, the scholar and minister, and got from him a definite agreement\r\nto entrust to the American Red Cross the selection of engineers and\r\ncapitalists to carry out this great reform upon conditions laid down.\r\n\r\nThe minister and I had frequent conferences. We discussed carefully\r\nthe engineering contracts, the conditions of the loan, the security.\r\nEvery sentence in the proposed agreement had been weighed, every\r\nword carefully chosen; finally, on January 27, 1914, it was signed\r\nby Chang Chien as minister, and by myself in behalf of the American\r\nRed Cross. The J.G. White Corporation was chosen to finance the\r\npreliminary survey. Thus there were sent to China during the next\r\nsummer three experts: Colonel (later Major General) Sibert, of the\r\nPanama Canal Commission; Mr. Arthur P. Davis, director of the United\r\nStates Reclamation Service; and Prof. D.W. Mead, of the University of\r\nWisconsin, an expert in hydraulic engineering.\r\n\r\nHere was a beginning of great promise, and in a new direction.\r\n\r\nBut American enterprise had already affected the daily life of the\r\nChinese in the field opened up by the Standard Oil Company. In fact,\r\nthe lamp of Standard Oil had lighted China.\r\n\r\nNow enter Mr. Yamaza, the Japanese minister. Japan, who had no oil in\r\nher lamp, wished to explore for it in China; so did other nations. But\r\nthe American oil company, in a way which I shall detail, had gotten\r\nthe concession. Moreover, the Bethlehem Steel Corporation had agreed\r\nfor $20,000,000 to build a merchant fleet for China, convertible into\r\ncruisers--this to take the place of an old imperial contract for\r\nwarships. At China's express request, and not at all because they were\r\nin that business, the Bethlehem people also consented to apply three\r\nmillions of the whole sum to improve a Chinese port. Together with the\r\nHwai River enterprise these American activities had put Japan on the\r\nalert. The Japanese press had distorted their significance, and now in\r\nthe small Bethlehem contract Mr. Yamaza began to see things--a future\r\nChinese mistress of the Asian seas, perhaps, and the Chinese littoral\r\nall besprinkled with naval ports. One evening Mr. Yamaza spoke to me\r\nabout it, and at length; it was plain that his government meant some\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nNow Mr. Yamaza and his first secretary, Mr. Midzuno, were both\r\nunusually clever men. They drank a great deal. The minister explained\r\nthat he did this for reasons of health, because, unless there were\r\nsomething he could give up if he should be taken sick, it might be\r\nvery bad for him. I recall how Mr. Midzuno entertained a party at\r\ndinner by detailing his notable collection of expressions in various\r\nlanguages, of equivalents to the German term \"Katzenjammer.\" Both of\r\nthese men had previous Chinese experience and were intimately familiar\r\nwith Chinese affairs. Yamaza was a man of great shrewdness; being under\r\nthe influence of liquor seemed rather to sharpen his understanding.\r\nTaciturn and speaking in hesitating sentences, he would never commit\r\nhimself to anything, but would deploy the conversation with great\r\nskill, in order to give his interlocutor every chance to do that very\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of this conversation we were guests of the manager\r\nof the Russo-Asiatic Bank. An amateur theatrical performance was in\r\nprogress--three French \"one-acters,\" the chief being \"The Man Who\r\nMarried a Dumb Wife,\" by Anatole France. Peking foreign society was\r\nthere in force; the majority were gathered in the large salon where the\r\nstage was set, others promenading or conversing in small groups. In the\r\nintermission between two plays I encountered the Japanese minister,\r\nand, finding that he desired to talk, wandered with him to the smoking\r\nroom, where we pre-empted a corner, whence during a long conversation\r\nwe would catch now and then the echoes from the salon as the action on\r\nthe stage rose to a more excited pitch.\r\n\r\nMr. Yamaza was more talkative than I had ever seen him. As was his\r\ncustom, he had consumed ardent waters quite freely, but, as always,\r\nhis mind was clear and alert. \"In Shensi and Chihli provinces,\" he\r\nopened up, \"the exertions of Japanese nationals in the matter of the\r\nconcession to the Standard Oil Company have given them a right to be\r\nconsidered. I have been contending to the Chinese that Japan has a\r\nprior interest in the oil field of Shensi Province. Do you not know\r\nthat Japanese engineers were formerly employed there?\"\r\n\r\nOn my part, I expressed surprise that the Japanese papers should make\r\nso much noise about the American oil concession, whereas it was quite\r\nnatural that Americans, who had done business in China for over a\r\ncentury, should occasionally go into new lines of enterprise.\r\n\r\nBut it soon became manifest that Mr. Yamaza was thinking of the\r\nBethlehem Steel contract. \"I must tell you,\" he said, \"of the\r\nstrategical importance of Fukien Province to my country.\" Then followed\r\na long exposition. \"China,\" he concluded, \"has promised not to alienate\r\nthis province to any other power, and Japan has repeatedly asserted an\r\ninterest in that region.\"\r\n\r\nHe then repeated various surmises and reports concerning the nature\r\nof the Bethlehem contract. I told him quite specifically the nature\r\nof the agreement and about its long previous existence. Mr. Johnston,\r\nvice-president of the Bethlehem company, at the request of the Chinese\r\nGovernment had viewed various naval ports with the purpose of making an\r\nestimate of improvements which were most needed. I could not admit any\r\nsinister significance in this visit nor concede that Americans were not\r\nfree to engage in port construction in any part of China.\r\n\r\nWhile I had not been unguarded in my statements, I had assuredly not\r\nlooked upon a conversation in such circumstances as a formal one.\r\nYet I soon found out that a memorandum upon it was presented to the\r\nDepartment of State by the Japanese Ambassador in Washington, during\r\nan interview with Secretary Bryan on the question of harbour works in\r\nFukien. I shall revert to this matter later.\r\n\r\nA peculiarity of Chinese psychology was evinced after the Standard Oil\r\ncontract had been signed. One year was given to select specific areas\r\nwithin which oil production was to be carried on as a joint enterprise\r\nof the Chinese Government and the American company, the ratio of\r\nproperty interest of the two partners being 45 to 55. The contract\r\nundoubtedly offered an opportunity for securing the major share in\r\nthe development of any petroleum resources which might be discovered\r\nin China; for, once such a partnership has been established and the\r\nwork under it carried out in an acceptable manner, an extension of the\r\nprivileges obtained may confidently be looked for. But in itself the\r\ncontract signed in February, 1914, was only a beginning. It denoted the\r\nsecuring of a bare legal right; and in China a government decree or\r\nconcession is not in itself all-powerful. If its motives are suspected,\r\nif it has been obtained by pressure or in secrecy, if its terms are not\r\nunderstood or are believed to imply unjust burdens to certain provinces\r\nor to the people at large, then popular opposition will arise. This may\r\nnot affect the legal character of the grant or the responsibility of\r\nthe Government, but it will seriously obstruct the ready and profitable\r\ncarrying out of the business. The obverse of this situation--the\r\ngetting of a contract \"on the square\" and the demonstration that it is\r\nfair and just--finds every influence willing to coöperate.\r\n\r\nBut when the Standard Oil Company's contract had been signed, not much\r\nwas publicly known about it save in general terms. Rival interests\r\nbegan to portray it as involving inroads upon the rights of the Chinese\r\npeople, especially of the provinces of Shensi and Chihli. Stories of\r\nbribery were circulated in the papers. In the negotiations concluded\r\nat Peking no particular attention had been paid to local opinion, the\r\nsuspicions of provincials were stirred, and an outcry speedily arose.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the Standard Oil Company had left Peking. I\r\ninformed the company that its interests were endangered. Its response\r\nwas to send to Peking Mr. Roy S. Anderson, the American whose intimate\r\nknowledge of Chinese affairs has been referred to. Mr. Anderson held\r\nsessions with those who had objected, especially with the provincials\r\nof Shensi who were resident in Peking. He discussed with them the terms\r\nof the contract, pointing out the benefit to the provinces through the\r\ndevelopment of a large industry there. The Chinese always respond to\r\nreasonable discussion, and not many days later the very associations\r\nwhich had protested most vigorously against the agreement waited upon\r\nthe Minister of Agriculture and Commerce with their congratulations.\r\nThey promised the aid of the province in carrying out the contract. Had\r\nthe contract not been straightforward and fair in its terms and free of\r\nundue influence in its making, such active support could not have been\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nIt was then that the Chinese Government created an Oil Development\r\nBureau, together with a River Conservancy Bureau for drainage works,\r\nincluding those projected in the Hwai River region. Of the new Oil\r\nDevelopment Bureau the Prime Minister, Mr. Hsiung Hsi-ling, on his\r\nresignation from the cabinet in March, accepted the position as chief.\r\nHe had been both Premier and concurrently Minister of Finance. Tall,\r\ngood-looking, with full face and shining black hair, Mr. Hsiung speaks\r\nwith great fluency in a high-pitched voice. Though he was a member of\r\nthe Chin Pu Tang, or progressive party, he had been selected Premier by\r\nYuan Shih-kai, who was fighting the democratic party (Kuo Min Tang),\r\nprobably because he believed that parliament would reject him and he\r\ncould then blame that body for obstructive tactics. It accepted him,\r\nand Yuan took another path to overthrow parliament. In his career Mr.\r\nHsiung had been aided by the counsel and coöperation of his wife, who\r\nis exceptionally capable. Well-intentioned, broad-minded, given to\r\nWestern methods, the Premier was handicapped during his term through\r\nrelative inexperience in administrative and financial matters. He was\r\npitted against men of shrewdness as politicians and of deep immersion\r\nin financial manipulations.\r\n\r\nAs chief of the Oil Development Bureau, Mr. Hsiung's first task was\r\nthat of pointing out to the Japanese minister, Mr. Yamaza, whom the\r\nJapanese interests immediately pressed forward, that no monopoly of\r\nexploitation had been granted to the Standard Oil Company, for within a\r\nyear the company would have to select specific and limited areas within\r\nthe two provinces where production was to be carried on.\r\n\r\n\"The grant to Americans,\" the Japanese minister thereupon remarked,\r\n\"seems to indicate that China does not care much about the\r\ninternational friendship of Japan.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hsiung's reply was that this was a business arrangement, and the\r\nnationals of other countries as well--Great Britain, France, and\r\nGermany--had sought such concessions in the recent past. To the inquiry\r\nwhether a similar agreement would be concluded with Japan for other\r\nprovinces, the director replied that it would not at this time be\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\n\"Then I hereby notify you,\" Mr. Yamaza rejoined, \"that in all\r\nlikelihood I shall take up this matter with the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Yamaza referred to the Japanese engineers who at one time worked\r\nin the oil fields of Shensi Province; whereupon Mr. Hsiung recalled\r\nthat American and German engineers had formerly been employed in the\r\nHanyehping iron enterprise; yet when that company made a loan agreement\r\nwith Japanese interests, no objections had been made either by America\r\nor Germany.\r\n\r\nThis conversation illustrates the manner in which attempts are\r\noften made to establish prior claims with regard to enterprises\r\nin China by alleging a prior desire or the prior employment of\r\nindividuals--considerations which would nowhere else be considered\r\nas establishing a preference or inchoate option. It is as much as\r\nto say that by merely expressing a wish for a thing one has already\r\nestablished a prior right to it should it be given out.\r\n\r\nThe making of two important contracts with the Chinese Government\r\nnaturally attracted attention. Of the British press the _North China\r\nDaily News_ repeated the judgment of its Peking correspondent: \"The\r\nAmericans deserve their success, for they have worked for it steadily\r\nand consistently.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Daily News_ attributed this success primarily to the fact that\r\nsince the days of Secretary Hay, American enterprise in China had been\r\nconsistently pacific and benevolent. \"In no country in the world,\" it\r\ndeclared, \"can more be done through friendship and for friendship's\r\nsake than in China.\"\r\n\r\nThe German press, while inclined to be critical, still admitted the\r\nfairness of the contracts and the probable benefit to be derived\r\ntherefrom by China, and spoke in disapproval of the Japanese\r\nattitude assumed toward the new oil enterprise. Later a long article\r\nappeared in the chief German paper in China (_Ostasiatische Lloyd_),\r\nin which the existence of a very far-reaching policy of economic\r\npenetration by America was surmised. The writer imagined that all the\r\nfactors--educational, financial, and industrial--were being guided\r\naccording to a complicated but harmonious plan to achieve the actual\r\npredominance of American interests in China.\r\n\r\nThe German minister, Von Haxthausen, spoke to me about this article. \"I\r\nhope,\" he said, \"that you will not conclude that its views are those of\r\nmyself and my legation.\"\r\n\r\nI assured him that I felt highly flattered that anybody should have\r\nconceived that American action proceeded with such careful planning and\r\nsuch cunning grasp of all details.\r\n\r\nThe Franco-Russian semi-official sheet, the _Journal de Pekin_,\r\ncontinued its carping attitude against all American enterprise. It\r\nlumped together the Y.M.C.A., missionaries, Standard Oil, and the\r\nBritish-American Tobacco Company as engaged in a nefarious effort to\r\ngain ascendency for American influence in China. It failed, however, to\r\nsurmise the subtle plan suggested in the German paper, but presupposed\r\nan instinctive coöperation of all these American agencies. This paper\r\nwas occasionally stirred to great waves of indignation, as when it\r\ndiscovered that the Y.M.C.A. was undermining Chinese religious morale\r\nand destroying the sanctity of holy places by establishing a bathing\r\npool in one of the temples. This deplorable desecration, which wrung\r\nfrom the breast of the Belgian editor of the Franco-Russian sheet moans\r\nof outraged virtue, had for its substance the fact that in the large\r\nmonastery of Wo Fu Ssu--in the foothills fifteen miles from Peking,\r\nwhere the Y.M.C.A. had summer quarters--a large pool in the residential\r\npart of the enclosures was actually used for a dip on hot mornings. But\r\nno Chinese had ever hinted that his feelings were lacerated.\r\n\r\nThe American papers and Americans generally were somewhat encouraged\r\nby this constructive action. In the Chinese Press the veteran\r\nAmerican lawyer, T.R. Jernigan, said: \"It is clear that the Wilson\r\nAdministration will use its influence to further the extension of the\r\nbusiness of American merchants whether they act in a corporate capacity\r\nor otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nOn the side of finance as well as industry the Chinese courted American\r\ninterest. The Minister of Finance and Mr. Liang Shih-yi were frequently\r\nmy guests; and we conversed particularly on the financial situation.\r\nBoth took a view quite different from the traditional Chinese official\r\nattitude. They desired to have the Government make itself useful and\r\ntake the lead in organizing both national credit and industry. They\r\nconsidered it possible to develop Chinese domestic credit to an extent\r\nthat would materially supply the financial needs of the Government.\r\nUnfortunately, the great system of banking which had been built up by\r\nthe Shansi Bankers' Guild was very inadequate to modern needs. Banking\r\nhad rested wholly on personal knowledge of the character and credit of\r\nborrowers; no collateral was used, there was no dealing in corporate\r\nsecurities.\r\n\r\nWhen China came into contact with the business methods of Western\r\nnations, this system could not help in developing new enterprises.\r\nThat task fell largely to the foreign banks established in the treaty\r\nports, who had no vision of the possibilities of internal development\r\nin China. The Shansi bankers, on their part, unable to adapt themselves\r\nto new conditions, saw their field of action gradually limited, their\r\nbusiness falling off. These banks lost their grip on affairs. They\r\nfelt themselves in need of financial assistance from the Government.\r\nThe Minister of Finance was considering whether these old institutions\r\nmight not be transformed into modern and adequate agencies of Chinese\r\ndomestic credit. He and other native financiers became interested\r\nin the national banking system through which, in the United States,\r\nquantities of public debentures had been absorbed to furnish a sound\r\nbasis for a currency.\r\n\r\nIt seemed impossible to utilize the Shansi banks as the main prop of a\r\nmodern system. A new organization, such as the Bank of China, planned\r\non modern lines, might be strengthened by American financial support\r\nand technical assistance. Mr. Liang Shih-yi was willing to give to\r\nAmerican interests an important share in the management of the Bank\r\nof China in return for a strengthening loan. A New York contractor,\r\nMr. G.M. Gest, was at this time in Peking on a pleasure tour with his\r\nfamily. Impressed with the need for the launching of new financial and\r\nindustrial enterprises in China, his first thought had been to secure a\r\nconcession to build a system of tramways in Peking. Chinese officials\r\nhad previously told me of an existing Chinese contract which might\r\nbe turned over to Americans. I was not very enthusiastic about this\r\nparticular enterprise, because I feared it might destroy the unique\r\ncharacter of Peking street life, without great business success or much\r\nbenefit to anybody.\r\n\r\nOn inquiring further we found that French interests had just signed a\r\nloan contract which covered, among other things, the Peking tramways.\r\n\r\nThe financing was curious; the proceeds were presumably to be used\r\nto complete the port works at Pukow, on the Yangtse River, and to\r\nestablish the tramways of Peking. However, it was plain that the loan\r\nhad been made really for administrative or political purposes, its\r\nindustrial character being secondary, as the work was indefinitely\r\npostponed. This subterfuge of so-called \"industrial loans,\" of which\r\nthe proceeds were to be used for politics, was later very extensively\r\nresorted to, particularly in the Japanese loans of 1918.\r\n\r\nLearning of this state of affairs, Mr. Gest turned his attention to the\r\nproblem of Chinese domestic financing, and at the close of his short\r\nresidence in Peking he had obtained an option for the Bank of China\r\nloan contract, which he followed up with energy upon his return to the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nAmerican attention had been drawn to the contracts for the Hwai River\r\nconservancy and for petroleum exploration, and American commercial\r\njournals and bankers were again giving thought to the financing of\r\nprojects in China. To show the attitude of New York bankers at this\r\ntime, of their difficulties, doubts, and inclinations, I shall cite\r\nportions of a letter written me by Mr. Willard Straight, dated April\r\n29, 1914. While I did not agree with Mr. Straight on several matters\r\nof detail, especially the withdrawal from the Consortium, we were both\r\nagreed as to the importance of continued American participation in\r\nChinese finance and industry. The letter follows:\r\n\r\n As regards the Hwai River conservancy, you have doubtless already been\r\n advised that the Red Cross has made an arrangement with J.G. White &\r\n Company, whereby an engineering board will be despatched to China to\r\n make a detailed survey. The matter of financing was brought to the\r\n Group, who felt it impossible satisfactorily to discuss this question\r\n without more definite information regarding actual conditions and the\r\n probable cost of the work contemplated.\r\n\r\n When, upon receipt of the report of the engineering board, we take up\r\n the discussion of the financial problem, the suggestions contained in\r\n your letter of the 24th of March will be very valuable. It might, as\r\n you say, be comparatively easy to issue a loan of ten million dollars\r\n at almost any time. That would depend, however, not on the size but on\r\n the nature of the loan. There is no market for Chinese securities in\r\n this country at this time, and it would be difficult if not impossible\r\n for the bankers to create one within any reasonable time without the\r\n active and intelligent support or at least the declared approval of\r\n the Government....\r\n\r\n When the American Group first entered upon negotiations for the\r\n Hukuang loan, conditions in this country were good. Business men were\r\n looking abroad for new trade openings, the Taft Administration was\r\n anxious to encourage the extension of foreign trade and the Chinese\r\n Governmental Bubble had not been pricked. During our four years of\r\n experience a not inconsiderable public interest in China and her\r\n development was aroused, and had we issued the Reorganization Loan, as\r\n we had hoped to do, in February, 1913, we probably could have sold our\r\n twenty-million-dollar share to investors throughout the country. This\r\n we would have been able to do despite the revolution and uncertain\r\n governmental conditions in China, because of public confidence due to\r\n the support of our own and the other interested governments.\r\n\r\n Neither Mr. Taft nor Mr. Knox ever promised to send American\r\n battleships to threaten China, or to land marines to occupy Chinese\r\n territory, in case of default in interest payments. The public was\r\n misled by no false statements, but there was, nevertheless, a general\r\n belief that our Government was actively interested in the preservation\r\n of China's credit and in the development of that country.\r\n\r\n This, as I told you in our conversation at the Century Club, was\r\n changed by the President's declaration of March 19, 1913. The fact\r\n that the President and the State Department felt that China, as a\r\n young republic, was entitled to extraordinary consideration and\r\n sympathy; the fact that our Government recognized Yuan Shih-kai's\r\n political machine, and the fact that the Administration subsequently\r\n gave out some general expressions regarding the Government's interest\r\n in the development of American trade, did not in any way restore in\r\n the mind of the investor the confidence which had been destroyed by\r\n the specific condemnation of the activities of the only American\r\n banking group which had had the enterprise, the courage, and the\r\n patience to enter and remain in the Chinese field and which, despite\r\n its unpopularity among certain yellow journals and a number of Western\r\n Congressmen, stood for integrity, fair dealing, and sound business in\r\n the minds of the bond-purchasing public, upon whose readiness to buy\r\n the success of any bond issue must depend.\r\n\r\n This confidence which would have enabled us to sell Chinese bonds had\r\n been created by four years of hard work on the part of the bankers and\r\n the Government. Once destroyed, it can be restored only by general\r\n governmental declarations, which will probably have to be stronger\r\n than any of those made by the Taft Administration, or, in the absence\r\n thereof, by effective, consistent, and repeated specific proof of\r\n the Government's willingness to assist and encourage our merchants,\r\n contractors, and bankers. As you know, it is more difficult to correct\r\n a bad impression than it is originally to create a good one.\r\n\r\n I quite appreciate that it will be difficult for the President to take\r\n any action which would seem to be a reversal of his former position,\r\n but I hope that the last paragraph of his declaration of last March,\r\n in which he stated that he would urge \"all the legislative measures\r\n necessary to assure to contractors, engineers, etc., the banking and\r\n other financial facilities which they now lack\" may be interpreted and\r\n developed along lines which will permit him actively to support the\r\n Red Cross plan.\r\n\r\n If the Administration will publicly evidence its interest in and its\r\n support of this project during the next few months, so that when the\r\n matter is finally brought up to the bankers for decision they may\r\n be able to feel that the public has become interested and assured\r\n that our Government is behind the plan, it may prove to be the means\r\n by which we can again enter China. This I have pointed out to Miss\r\n Boardman who, I feel sure, fully understands the situation.\r\n\r\n I sincerely trust that your great interest and your energy in\r\n endeavouring to extend our interests in China may have an effect\r\n upon our own Administration. I believe the bankers will always be\r\n willing to help if they are able to do so, but we are not, like our\r\n Continental friends, anxiously looking for chances to invest abroad,\r\n especially at the present time when we have so many troubles of our\r\n own, and instead of being merely shown the opportunity, we must be\r\n persuaded in the first place that it is sound business and in the\r\n second place that it is our patriotic duty to undertake it. And we\r\n must feel, in addition, that if we should undertake it our enterprise\r\n and energy will not serve merely to rouse a storm of jealousy on the\r\n part of those who will not assume any risks themselves, but who cry\r\n \"monopoly\" as soon as an interest capable of handling foreign business\r\n is given the active support of our Government.\r\n\r\n I am sorry that it is impossible to give a more optimistic picture,\r\n but I assure you that I shall do all in my power to support you and\r\n your efforts, which I sincerely trust may be attended with the success\r\n they deserve.\r\n\r\nThe intelligent support promised in this letter continued until the\r\nuntimely death of Mr. Straight in Paris, while he was with the American\r\nPeace Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\"SLOW AMERICANS\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Americans are altogether too slow!\"\r\n\r\nThis exclamation from a Chinese seemed amusing. It came on the evening\r\nof the red dust-storm that enveloped Peking, during one of the long\r\nafter-dinner conversations with Liang Shih-yi and Chow Tsu-chi; and it\r\nwas the latter who thus gave vent to his impatience.\r\n\r\nLiang Shih-yi, the \"Pierpont Morgan of China,\" Chief Secretary to the\r\nPresident, was credited as being, next to Yuan Shih-kai, the ablest and\r\nmost influential man in Peking. Mr. Liang is highly educated according\r\nto Chinese literary standards, and while he has not studied Western\r\nscience, he has a keen, incisive mind which enables him readily to\r\nunderstand Western conditions and methods. His outstanding quality is\r\na faculty for organization. He built up the Chinese Communications\r\nService on the administrative and financial side. He declined taking\r\noffice as a minister, but usually controlled the action of the cabinet\r\nthrough his influence over important subordinates, and managed all\r\nfinancial affairs for Yuan Shih-kai. Cantonese, short of stature and\r\nthickset, with a massive Napoleonic head, he speaks little, but his\r\nside remarks indicate that he is always ahead of the discussion, which\r\nis also shown by his searching questions. When directly questioned\r\nhimself, he will always give a lucid and consecutive account of any\r\nmatter. He did not rise above the level of Chinese official practice\r\nin the matter of using money to obtain political ends. To some he was\r\nthe father of deceit and corruption, to others the god of wealth, while\r\nstill others revered in him his great genius for organization. While\r\nby no means a romantic figure, he thoroughly stimulated a romantic\r\ninterest among others, who attributed to him almost superhuman cunning\r\nand ability.\r\n\r\nWhen the noted Sheng Hsuan-huai became Minister of Communications in\r\n1911, he used his influence and cunning to thwart Liang and throw him\r\nout of the mastery of the Board of Communications, known as the fattest\r\norgan of the Government. Mr. Liang stood his ground, and his influence\r\ngreatly increased because of his ability to withstand so strong an\r\nattack. During the revolution Liang Shih-yi was also very influential\r\nin the Grand Council, attaching himself more and more strongly to Yuan\r\nShih-kai. Always satisfied with the substance of power without its\r\noutward show, he steadfastly declined to become a responsible minister,\r\nand worked from the vantage ground of the Secretariat of the President.\r\nHis life has frequently been endangered. He gained the hatred of\r\nthe democratic party, with which he was once associated, because he\r\naided Yuan in playing his complicated game of first confusing, then\r\ndestroying, parliament. Nor were the Progressives (Chin Pu Tang)\r\nenamoured of him. Of great personal courage, he was indifferent to\r\nthe blame and ridicule which for a while almost all newspapers heaped\r\nupon him. As he was still in a comparatively inferior position when\r\nthese attacks began, they rather helped him by calling attention to his\r\nabilities and his personal importance. Thus his opponents advertised\r\nhim. In possession of all the intricacies of the situation, when the\r\nparliamentarians first came to Peking, he sat back inconspicuously,\r\nand, supplied with influence and money, moulded the political situation\r\nas if it had been wax.\r\n\r\nOf all the cabinet, Mr. Chow Tsu-chi, Minister of Communications,\r\nwas personally most familiar with American affairs, having lived for\r\nseveral years in Washington and New York in an official capacity.\r\nHe speaks English fluently and prefers American methods. He hates\r\nunnecessary ceremony. Whenever he called upon me I had almost to\r\nengage in personal combat with him to be permitted to accompany him to\r\nthe outer door, as is due to a high dignitary in China. He believes in\r\nlearning improved methods from reliable foreigners, and will go as far\r\nas any Chinese in giving foreigners whom he trusts a free hand, though\r\nhe would not yield to any one a power of supreme control. On this\r\noccasion he talked about the reorganization of the Bank of China, and\r\nthe possibility of floating domestic bonds among Chinese capitalists.\r\nMr. Chow was chanting a jeremiad about how the Chinese had been led to\r\ngive valuable concessions to Americans, which had not been developed,\r\nand how this had brought only embarrassment and trouble to China.\r\n\r\nWe spoke, also, of the original Hankow-Canton railway concession which\r\nthe Americans tried to sell to King Leopold; of the Knox neutralization\r\nplan, and of the Chinchow-Aigun railway concession, the only effect of\r\nwhich had been to strengthen the grip of Russia and Japan on Manchuria.\r\nWhen the Americans, as a mark of special confidence and trust, had\r\nreceived the option on a currency loan with the chance to reorganize\r\nChinese currency, they had straight-way invited Great Britain,\r\nGermany, and France into the game. \"Thus they saddled China with the\r\nInternational Consortium,\" Chow Tsu-chi moaned. And so on went the\r\nrecital, through many lesser and larger enterprises that had proved\r\nabortive.\r\n\r\nOne had to confess that in China we certainly had not taken Fortune by\r\nthe forelock, nor even had we clung to her skirts. Mr. Chow Tsu-chi\r\nwas especially grieved at the circuitous and dilatory methods of the\r\nFour-Power Group which held the contract to build the Hukuang railways.\r\n\"The thirty millions of dollars originally provided has been almost\r\nentirely spent,\" he complained, \"without producing more than two\r\nhundred miles of actual construction; and there is constant wrangling\r\namong the partners concerning engineering standards. Moreover,\r\neverything has to be referred from Peking to London, thence to New\r\nYork, Paris, Berlin, and back and forth among them all, until it is\r\nnecessary to look up reams of files to know what it is all about. And\r\nit may all have been about the purchase of a flat car.\"\r\n\r\nI knew well enough that Americans, too, were much discouraged at the\r\ncumbersome progress of the Hukuang railway enterprise. The engineering\r\nrights on the section west from Ichang up into Szechuan Province had\r\nbeen assigned to America, and Mr. W. Randolph was at this time making\r\na survey. He had great energy and unlimited belief in the future\r\nimportance and profitableness of this line. But beyond the initial\r\nsurvey the available funds would not go, and no new financing could\r\nbe obtained--this for a railway to gain access to an inland empire of\r\nforty millions of people!\r\n\r\nIn the American enterprises which had been launched recently, however,\r\nthere was no little activity. The Standard Oil Company with commendable\r\nexpedition, if perhaps with undue lavishness of men and supplies,\r\nsent to China geological experts of the first order, together with\r\nlarge staffs of engineers, drilling experts, and all needed machinery.\r\nThe geologists were soon off toward the prospective oil regions in\r\nChihli and Shensi provinces. In Mr. Hsiung Hsi-ling's bureau and in\r\nthe Standard Oil offices the outfitting of expeditions, the purchase\r\nof supplies, and the selection of a large Chinese personnel proceeded\r\napace. Everyone was hopeful.\r\n\r\nWith the Hwai River conservancy matter, also, negotiations had gone\r\nrapidly in the United States. The American National Red Cross and the\r\nengineering firm of J.G. White & Company had agreed to finance the\r\npreliminary survey. The American Congress in May passed an act lending\r\nthe services of an army engineer for the preliminary survey. Colonel\r\nSibert of the Panama Canal Commission was designated as chairman of the\r\nengineering board. The outlook was favourable, action had been taken\r\npromptly.\r\n\r\nThe excitement stirred up among the Japanese by the sojourn in China of\r\nthe Bethlehem Steel Company's vice-president, Mr. Archibald Johnston,\r\nnow had a further sequel. The text of an alleged contract between the\r\nChinese Government and the Bethlehem Steel Company was circulated early\r\nin May--by interested persons--which included among other provisions\r\narrangements for construction of a naval base in Fukien Province.\r\nThe bogus quality of the report was at once manifest. Through some\r\ninfluence, however, it was assiduously pushed forward in the press;\r\nit became the basis of a legend, which even got into the books of\r\notherwise well-informed writers as authentic. It was on the subject of\r\nthis spurious paper that the Japanese ambassador at Washington called\r\non Secretary Bryan for information. Thus the matter of the possible\r\nbuilding of a naval base in Fukien for the Chinese Government by\r\nAmerican contractors became a matter of State Department note. I was\r\ninformed that the Japanese ambassador at Washington had left a summary\r\nof the conversation, of March 12th, between the Japanese minister at\r\nPeking and myself. Apparently the Japanese were attempting to get\r\naround my refusal to acknowledge that American enterprise in China\r\ncould in any way be limited by the declarations or agreements of other\r\npowers than the United States.\r\n\r\nThe State Department inquired whether the newly reported contract for\r\na loan of $30,000,000 was identical with the older contract of the\r\nBethlehem Steel Company. I was informed that the Japanese Government\r\ndid not object to the loan, but to the construction of any new naval\r\nbase in Fukien, and that the Department had been told that the Chinese\r\nGovernment itself did not wish to construct there because of the\r\nJapanese objection. It was intimated to me that I might encourage the\r\nChinese in the idea that such building, while legitimate, would be\r\nunwise.\r\n\r\nI reported to the Department that the original Bethlehem contract had\r\nno connection with the spurious document recently circulated; that\r\nonly a very small sum was to be devoted to harbour work in China, the\r\nlocation of which had not been fixed; and that the execution of the\r\nentire contract had been postponed because of financial conditions.\r\nWhile the Chinese Government was not contemplating any construction\r\nat this time, I stated that the attempt of any other government to\r\nestablish a claim of special rights of supervision must be considered\r\nderogatory to Chinese sovereignty and to American rights of equal\r\nopportunity; I urged, therefore, that we avoid any action or statement\r\nwhich would admit such a claim, or which would in any way encourage\r\nthe making of it. The Chinese Government has never admitted that its\r\nright to plan the defence of its coastline is subject to veto by any\r\nother government. Such admission on our part that Japan has the right\r\nto claim special interests in Fukien would shake the confidence of the\r\nChinese in our seriousness and consistency, and in our determination to\r\nprotect our legitimate interests in an undivided China, freely open to\r\nthe commerce of all nations, where Americans can do business without\r\nasking permission of any other outsiders.\r\n\r\nDr. Chen Chin-tao was then acting as Financial Commissioner of the\r\nChinese Government in Europe and America. The danger of a further\r\ngrowth of the idea of spheres of influence in China had been\r\naccentuated. Railway concessions had been allocated to different\r\nnations according to territorial areas where the respective countries\r\nclaimed certain priorities; if concessions were made otherwise, the\r\ncombined influence of the powers seeking special spheres was used to\r\ndefeat them. To meet this danger a plan was developed for granting a\r\nlarge construction contract to an international syndicate made up\r\nof British, American, French, and German companies, who would divide\r\nthe construction on some basis other than localized national spheres\r\nof influence. Doctor Chen, with an American assistant, was charged to\r\ntake up this proposal with various companies. On the part of France and\r\nGermany, contractors and governments seemed favourable to the idea.\r\nIn Great Britain the firm approached was Paulding & Company, who had\r\nalready in the preceding year received a railway concession in China\r\nextending through the Province of Hunan and to the south thereof. This\r\nfirm would readily coöperate, but the British Government objected.\r\nIt would accept the principle of the international company only on\r\ncondition that all lines traversing the Yangtse Valley should be\r\nconstructed by the British participant in the syndicate.\r\n\r\nThis suggests the extent to which the sphere-of-influence doctrine\r\ndominated at this time the thought and action of the British Foreign\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nThe American Government, on its part, took exception to the size and\r\nduration of the concession, which it feared might gain a monopolistic\r\ncharacter. Probably the difficulty would have been cleared up, since,\r\nafter all, a specific and limited, though considerable grant, was\r\nintended. But the preliminary discussion had not resulted in agreement\r\nbefore the Great War supervened.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Gest returned to the United States, he took up the matter\r\nof a loan to China with American financial interests, but they\r\nhesitated to act until the American Government expressed its approval\r\nand willingness to give support. Mr. Gest thereupon laid siege to\r\nthe Department of State. He succeeded on the 3rd of June in securing\r\nfrom the Secretary a letter to the effect that the Department would\r\nbe gratified to have China receive any substantial assistance from\r\nAmericans in the nature of a loan upon terms similar to the present\r\nagreement. \"This Government,\" the letter stated, \"will, in accordance\r\nwith its usual policy, give all proper diplomatic support to any\r\nlegitimate enterprise of that character.\"\r\n\r\nThere had been much talk about the supposed determination of the\r\nDepartment of State to let American interests abroad shift for\r\nthemselves, quite without encouragement or special protection.\r\nThe letter, though moderate in language, nevertheless attracted\r\ngreat attention and was taken to indicate a change of heart in the\r\nAdministration. I may say at this point that the Department of State\r\nnever at any time failed to back me in efforts to develop and protect\r\nAmerican interests in China. But it was not always able, especially\r\nlater on, when overburdened with the work of the war, to follow up\r\nmatters which it had approved, when the opposition or indifference of\r\nother departments put other claims in the forefront.\r\n\r\nI had for a season observed and worked with American commercial\r\ninterests in China. I had definite conclusions as to what was needed in\r\nthe way of organization to encourage American trade. The great defect\r\nlay in the absence of financial institutions for handling foreign\r\nloans, and for assisting in foreign industrial development, helpful to\r\nAmerican commerce. The only American bank in China, the International\r\nBanking Corporation, then confined itself strictly to exchange business\r\nand to dealing in commercial paper; it had developed no policy\r\nof responding to local industrial needs and helping in the inner\r\ndevelopment of China. All the foreign banks had wholly the treaty-port\r\npoint of view. They thought not at all of developing the interior\r\nregions upon which the commerce of the treaty ports after all depends.\r\nThey were satisfied with scooping off the cream of international\r\ncommercial transactions and exchange operations.\r\n\r\nI strongly favoured creating banking institutions which would broadly\r\nrepresent American capital from various regions of our country, and\r\nwould respond to the urgent need of China for a modern organization of\r\nlocal credit.\r\n\r\nThere were but few American commission houses. In most cases\r\nAmerican-manufactured goods were handled by houses of other\r\nnationality, who often gave scant attention to promoting American trade\r\nand used American products only when those of their own nation could\r\nnot be obtained. It seemed worth while to establish additional trading\r\ncompanies, especially coöperative organizations among exporters,\r\nafter the fashion of the \"Representation for British Manufacturers,\r\nLtd.\" Further, I strongly urged the American Government to station a\r\ncommercial attaché in China. I was gratified by the appointment during\r\nthe year of a commercial attaché in the person of Consul-General Julean\r\nArnold, an official of great intelligence, wide knowledge, and untiring\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese cabinet, which had been under a provisional premier for\r\nseveral months, was finally reorganized in June, 1914. The chief change\r\nin the cabinet was the appointment of Mr. Liang Tun-yen as Minister\r\nof Communications, and the shifting of Mr. Chow Tsu-chi from that\r\nposition to the Ministry of Finance. With these new ministers American\r\ncontractors and financiers had much to do. Premier Hsiung Hsi-ling had\r\nwithdrawn in February, and with him the two other members of the Chin\r\nPu Tang or progressive party. These political leaders had served Yuan's\r\npurpose by aiding him to dissolve parliament; they could now be spared.\r\nBut a new premier was not immediately found. Yuan at length prevailed\r\non Mr. Hsu Shi-chang to take the premiership in June. The title of\r\npremier was changed to secretary of state.\r\n\r\nI met Mr. Liang Tun-yen for the first time on June 2nd, at a luncheon\r\ngiven by Mr. B. Lenox Simpson, whose landlord he was. Mr. Liang is\r\ntall, aristocratic-looking, with a fine, intellectual face. He speaks\r\nEnglish perfectly, as he received his earlier education in the\r\nUnited States. Then, as on frequent occasions in subsequent years, he\r\nexpressed himself in a deeply pessimistic strain. He complained of\r\nrecent inroads attempted by the French in Yunnan, and of the methods\r\nthey employed to strengthen their hold. But this was only one cause for\r\npessimism. In the future of his country he saw \"no prospect of strong\r\nnational action,\" or of \"any sort of effective help from the outside.\"\r\nHe considered the upper classes \"incapable of sacrifices and vigorous\r\naction.\" He had recommended in 1901, he told me, that, instead of\r\npaying an indemnity, the Chinese should be allowed to spend an equal\r\namount of public funds in sending abroad young men to be educated. All\r\nyoung Chinese, he said, should be sent abroad quite early, \"before they\r\nhave become corrupted.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Liang Tun-yen assumed office, it was announced that he would\r\nsubject the Ministry of Communications to a thorough cleansing. This\r\nimplied that the ministry had been corrupt and systematically so, under\r\nthe control of Mr. Liang Shih-yi. Outsiders watched for indications of\r\nhow that astute manager would handle the new opposition.\r\n\r\nMr. Yeh Kung-cho, able and expert, had been chief of the Railway\r\nBureau; he became a vice minister, but as he was a lieutenant of Liang\r\nShih-yi's, it was understood that this position would probably be an\r\nempty dignity. A friend of Mr. Liang Tun-yen's, a highly respected\r\nengineer of American education, was appointed as the other vice\r\nminister. With no formal or open breach between the different factions,\r\nmaneuvring and counter-manoeuvring there undoubtedly was. The\r\ninfluence of Mr. Liang Shih-yi, however, seemed not seriously shaken.\r\nHe had organized the Chinese railway experts and engineers in a railway\r\nassociation, keeping in touch with them through Mr. Yeh Kung-cho. Thus\r\nhe held in his hands the main lines of influence. Also, he continued to\r\nhead the Bank of Communications, which is the fiscal agency for the\r\nRailway Board. So again it seemed that the opposition could not get at\r\nthe source of this unusual man's power.\r\n\r\nMr. Chow Tsu-chi, as Minister of Finance, warmly urged the idea that\r\nthe Americans, to whom the Government had shown itself so friendly,\r\nreciprocate by making a loan to the Chinese Government. He planned a\r\nloan of $40,000,000 for the purpose of refunding the entire floating\r\nindebtedness of his government. Hopes had been entertained that the\r\nStandard Oil Company would use its influence in bringing about such a\r\nloan, but that company was not willing to go outside of the special\r\nbusiness of its contract with China. The option which had been given\r\nto Mr. Gest had not yet resulted in any completed transaction in\r\nthe United States. So accustomed were the Chinese to the readiness\r\nof any nationality which held important concessions, in turn to\r\nsupport the Chinese Government financially, that they could not\r\nunderstand how America, with professions of great friendship and just\r\nnow substantially favoured by the Chinese, should not be ready to\r\nreciprocate. The soundness of the desire of the Americans to have every\r\ntransaction stand on its own bottom and not to use financial support as\r\na bait to obtain concessions, could, of course, be appreciated by the\r\nChinese. But at times their urgent needs made them impatient.\r\n\r\nThe news of the assassination at Sarajevo reached us on July 1st. As\r\nthis happened to be, though we did not then suspect it, the eve of a\r\nterrible convulsion in which all accepted conditions of life, national\r\nand international, were shattered and unsettled, I shall here insert\r\nparts of the memorandum which I drew up for my guidance at this time:\r\n\r\n It is evident that China finds herself in a critical situation, in\r\n the sense that the fundamental character of her political life and\r\n the direction of her political development are now being decided.\r\n While a vast community living under a complicated social system,\r\n which embodies the experience of thousands of years, cannot change\r\n its methods of a sudden and will undoubtedly for a long time continue\r\n to differ radically from Western political societies, yet it admits\r\n of no doubt that a new era of development has begun and that certain\r\n essential alternatives are being faced. Such alternatives are\r\n the continued unity of the nation or its division; its continued\r\n independence or the direct dominance of one or more foreign suzerains;\r\n its commercial unity or its division into spheres of influence; the\r\n tendency of its institutions of government, whether in the direction\r\n of the absolutism of Russia and Japan, or the republicanism of the\r\n United States; and the character of its educational and legal system,\r\n either dominated by the ideas of America and England or of continental\r\n Europe or Japan. From these, there also follow important alternatives\r\n in industrial and commercial policy.\r\n\r\n Under these circumstances, it is of great moment whether the Chinese\r\n Government will remain free, with the assistance of influences\r\n friendly to the development of China's nationality, to preserve the\r\n unity of the Chinese State and to develop its institutions; or whether\r\n its financial distress, combined with the plottings of a revolutionary\r\n opposition, will deliver it into the hands of those who are not\r\n favourable to the growth of China's national life.\r\n\r\n The United States of America enjoys a position of great advantage\r\n for assisting the Chinese Government and influencing its development\r\n in the direction of free national life. The lack of a desire for\r\n political interference, the real sympathy felt in America with the\r\n strivings of the Chinese people, and cultural, educational, and\r\n charitable work unselfishly performed, have given the United States\r\n the undivided confidence of China. It is certainly true that the\r\n Chinese people are anxious to follow in the footsteps of the United\r\n States if they may only be permitted to do so.\r\n\r\n Any development of enterprise which increases American commercial\r\n interest in China is incidentally favourable to Chinese independence;\r\n because, through the enlistment of neutral interests, the desire\r\n of outsiders for political control can be counterbalanced. The\r\n organizing of an American investment bank and similar agencies for the\r\n development of American commerce in China, participation of American\r\n capital in railway building, and the development of mines and oil\r\n fields through American companies and under American business methods\r\n would all be welcomed by China as the strengthening of a favourable\r\n influence. Different Chinese ministers have repeatedly said to me\r\n that at this time China is in need of the active assistance of those\r\n who are amicably disposed and that China is willing to do her part in\r\n coöperating, and in extending advantages, if only such active support\r\n is forthcoming. If American capital, industry, and commerce are not\r\n ready at this time to give that comparatively slight assistance to\r\n China which the situation calls for, it is likely that American action\r\n in China in the future will be on a far more modest basis than present\r\n possibilities promise.\r\n\r\nThe war, of course, brought many changes in China. Much of the good\r\nwork which had been started was either destroyed or long delayed. It\r\nmarked the end of one phase of China's development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nFOLK WAYS AND OFFICIALS\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral voices whispered: \"It's Prince Pu Lun.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at President Yuan Shih-kai's reception, New Year's Day, 1914;\r\nthe diplomatic corps and high officials were there. The Empress\r\nDowager's residence, now occupied by the President, was the scene.\r\nFrom the side rooms, whither we had withdrawn for refreshments after\r\nexchanging greetings with the President, we looked out into the main\r\nhall and saw that its floor had been entirely cleared, and a solitary\r\nfigure in a general's uniform was proceeding across the floor toward\r\nthe President. Walking alone and unattended, the representative of the\r\nChinese Imperial Family had come to bring its felicitations to the\r\nPresident of the Republic. For the first time since the abdication, the\r\nImperial Family was publicly taking notice of him who had displaced it\r\nin power.\r\n\r\nWhen the guests began to depart I gathered up my party and left the\r\nhall, together with Admiral Tsai Ting-kan. Outside was Prince Pu Lun,\r\nstill solitary, walking with sad and pensive regard. We overtook him.\r\nI talked pleasantly with him on such non-committal matters as the\r\nImperial collection of art, which was at this time being brought from\r\nMukden. He seemed quite appreciative of this attention. I took him with\r\nme to the outer palace gate where his own carriage met him.\r\n\r\nExcept the automobiles used inside of the palace enclosure, few were\r\nthen to be found in Peking; soon, with improved roads, many hundreds\r\ncame. The Empress Dowager before her death had acquired a large\r\ncollection of these foreign vehicles, which interested her greatly;\r\nbut up to the time of her death the Board of Ceremonies had not\r\nsucceeded in solving the problem how she might ride in an automobile\r\nin which there would also be, in sitting posture, one of her servants,\r\nthe chauffeur. If they had had more time, I imagine that they might\r\nhave found some way by which the chauffeur could kneel in driving the\r\nImperial car, but, as it was, the poor Empress Dowager never had the\r\npleasure of the swift rides she so much coveted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany popular superstitions still prevailed in parts of the provinces.\r\nThe military attaché of the American Legation, Major Bowley, who later\r\ndid distinguished service in the Great War as general of artillery,\r\nwas active in visiting the military commanders in different parts of\r\nChina and in observing their actions and getting their views. He had\r\njust returned from such a trip to Kiangsi Province, and related how\r\none of the generals there strove to improve his morale by drinking the\r\nblood of enemies who had been killed. He spared Major Bowley a cupful\r\nof this precious liquid, which was to be taken before breakfast. It is\r\nstartling to discover among the people so highly civilized as are the\r\nChinese occasional remnants of barbarous doctrines and practices. There\r\nis an inverted homoeopathy in Chinese popular belief--to the effect\r\nthat \"equals strengthen equals\"; thus, to eat muscle develops strength,\r\nto eat tripe aids the digestion, to eat heart or drink blood develops\r\ncourage, and so on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne evening, at a dinner at Mr. Liang Shih-yi's house a spirited\r\ndiscussion developed between the host and Mr. Anderson. The latter had\r\nrelated a local custom of the Soochow region according to which it was\r\npermissible for a community or a crowd of people to bite to death any\r\nperson who was thoroughly disapproved of by all. Apparently the method\r\nof execution was in itself a guaranty of universal condemnation, as a\r\ngreat many people would have to coöperate to effect the desired result\r\nby this method. Mr. Liang protested that the expression \"bite to death\"\r\nwas in this case used only metaphorically, and there followed a long\r\ndebate on Chinese folk customs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA dinner with General Kiang, Commander of the Peking Gendarmerie,\r\nafforded another sidelight on Chinese character. We had already\r\nbeen seated, when an unusually tall Chinese entered, wearing\r\nChinese civilian dress. He was introduced as Tutuh Yin (General Yin\r\nChang-heng), and I learned that he had just returned from Szechuan,\r\nwhere he had become governor during the revolution, after putting to\r\ndeath the Imperial Governor-General, Chao Er-feng. General Yin was of\r\nstriking appearance, with strong features, and vigorous in gesture.\r\nNow, it is the custom at Chinese dinners, particularly when military\r\nare present, to engage in extensive drinkings of health. The Chinese,\r\nwho are usually very abstemious, drink wine that resembles sherry, and\r\nalso a liqueur-like rice wine, which latter is potent. The proposer\r\nof the toast raises his little cup and drains it in one draught; the\r\nguest to whom he addresses himself is expected to do likewise; both say\r\n\"Gambey\" (a challenge to empty the cup). General Yin, who seemed in\r\nhigh spirits, was on his legs half the time \"gambeying\" to the other\r\nguests, especially to myself and the other Americans, the military\r\nattaché, the Chinese secretary, the commandant of the guard, and other\r\nofficers. General Yin must have performed this courtesy at least forty\r\ntimes in the course of the evening, which with the attentions paid us\r\nby the other members of the table round, amounted to a considerable\r\nchallenge of one's capacity. It must, however, be confessed that I\r\nlargely shirked this test, in company with the amiable General Yin\r\nChang, my Manchu neighbour, by irrigating a large plant in front of us\r\nwith the liquid dedicated to friendship.\r\n\r\nI saw General Yin Chang next morning. He asked whether I knew what\r\nhad been the matter with Tutuh Yin the night before. I said that he\r\nseemed very animated and carried his liquor very well. General Yin\r\nthen told me that after I had left, the Tutuh Yin had sat down with\r\nhim and talked seriously and intently, revealing his deep worry lest\r\nYuan Shih-kai should have him executed. He stated that Chao Er-hsun,\r\nthe brother of the murdered Viceroy, was in Peking, and with other men\r\nusing every influence to destroy him. \"So,\" the Manchu general said,\r\n\"his bravado was just a cover for his worries.\"\r\n\r\nNext day Yin Tutuh called on me at my residence. He expressed deep\r\nregret for having taken so much wine on the evening of the dinner. He\r\nsaid: \"It is not my custom, but I was excited and worried because of\r\nthe uncertainty of my affairs.\" He then launched forth into a literary\r\ndiscussion of Confucianism in its bearing upon modern thought. Not\r\nknowing that he was a student of the classics, I was surprised when\r\nhe revealed this side of his nature. As a matter of fact, he greatly\r\nresembled the men of the Renaissance who combined harsh and cruel\r\nqualities with a deep love of literature. The last time I saw the Tutuh\r\nYin, more than five years later, he presented me with his written\r\nworks. There were gathered about twenty members of the Confucian\r\nSociety, and the conversation again turned around the permanent\r\nqualities of Confucianism. When the concept of the \"unknowable\" was\r\nreferred to, General Yin cited at length Herbert Spencer's views\r\nthereon. He said: \"The greatness of Confucius lies in the fact that he\r\ncentred his attention on those things which we know and can control,\r\nand that he aimed at the highest development of human action on this\r\ncommon-sense basis. He leaves the dreams about the unknowable to\r\nothers.\"\r\n\r\nAmong our guests at a dinner was Dr. King Ya-mei, a Chinese lady\r\nnoted for her wide information and cleverness. We spoke about the\r\nrecent advance of Russia in Mongolia. \"Who can resist Russia!\" she\r\nexclaimed. Like all thinking Chinese, she was deeply worried about the\r\ndifficulties confronting her nation on all sides. Dr. C.C. Wang, who\r\nwas also present, spoke of the lack of continuity in developing expert\r\nknowledge, because of the frequent shifts which are made in the public\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nDr. King Ya-mei then told an amusing incident, which shows how natural\r\ncommunity action and passive resistance are to the Chinese. In an\r\norphan asylum at Tientsin a new set of regulations had been issued, but\r\nthe orphans had paid no attention to them. After a good many children\r\nhad been called to order without result, a meeting was convoked by\r\nthe principal. When the orphans were asked why they did not obey\r\nthe regulations, their spokesman said: \"We are perfectly satisfied\r\nwith the old regulations, and have no desire to change them.\"--\"But\r\nthe new regulations have been made by your teachers,\" rejoined the\r\nsuperintendent, \"and they must be obeyed.\"--\"We do not think,\" the\r\nspokesman replied, \"that they are an improvement, and we propose to\r\nobey the old rules.\"--\"But, then you shall be punished severely.\"--\"If\r\nyou try to punish us, we shall all go away; and then what will become\r\nof the orphan asylum?\"\r\n\r\nThey had reasoned it out that they were an important part of the\r\ninstitution. That orphans should conceive the idea to go on strike\r\nshows how normal and self-evident that mode of social action seems in\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was visited by the newly appointed Chinese minister to Japan, Mr. Lu\r\nTsung-yu, who later became quite notorious in China in connection with\r\nthe loans of 1918. He was accompanied by Doctor Tsur, the president\r\nof Tsing Hua College and a leading American-returned student.\r\nMr. Lu is a slight man of suave manners, keen intelligence, and a\r\nlove of manipulation. On this occasion he developed the idea that\r\ncoöperation between the United States, China, and Japan was possible\r\nand desirable, as these three countries had many parallel interests.\r\nIt was his opinion that Japan could not create an extensive settlement\r\nin Manchuria. He had been stationed in that region several years\r\nwhen Hsu Hsi-chang was viceroy; and he told me that he had observed\r\nthat the Japanese came as officials, soldiers, or railway employees,\r\nor in connection with mining enterprises: but they did not seem to\r\nhave any impulse to settle in the country as farmers, and as small\r\nmerchants they could scarcely compete with the Chinese. Mr. Lu had been\r\neducated in Japan, being one of the first batch of Chinese students\r\nat Waseda University; together with Tsao Ju-lin, at this time Vice\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, who also later played an important part\r\nin Chino-Japanese affairs; and Chang Chung-hsiang, the Chief Justice\r\nof China at that time, a man who exercised considerable influence in\r\nintroducing into China the Japanese idea of judicial procedure and\r\norganization and who became Chinese minister in Tokyo in 1916. This\r\ntrio of associates was popularly known as \"the Three Diamonds.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn important meeting of the diplomatic corps dealt with the procedure\r\nin the matter of claims against the Chinese Government on account of\r\ndamage suffered during the revolution. The Japanese, French, and German\r\nrepresentatives were inclined to insist that the Chinese Government\r\nbe held responsible for all losses which could in any way be said to\r\nhave been caused, directly or indirectly, by the revolution. In line\r\nwith the traditional policy of fairness and moderation followed by the\r\nUnited States I strongly urged that only losses directly and physically\r\ntraceable to violent action should be paid, eliminating such uncertain\r\nand contingent matters as anticipated profits. The British minister\r\ngave support to this view; his legation, too, had not encouraged the\r\nfiling of indirect claims. After much discussion, the suggestion was\r\naccepted in the form proposed. By this action were ruled out indirect\r\nclaims to the amount of nearly four million dollars, which had already\r\nbeen listed and included by some of the legations in their totals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe British Legation, in which diplomatic meetings are held, is an old\r\npalace, formerly the residence of a Manchu prince, which was purchased\r\nby the British Government at the time when legations were first\r\nestablished at Peking. Fortunately, the fine architectural forms of\r\nthe old structure had been retained sufficiently to leave this group\r\nof buildings justly proportioned, beautifully decorated, and free from\r\njarring foreign notes. One passes to the minister's residence through\r\ntwo lofty, open halls, with tiled roofs and richly coloured eaves. The\r\nresidential buildings are Chinese without and semi-European within,\r\nChinese decorative elements having been allowed to remain in the inner\r\nspaces. The diplomatic meetings always took place in the dining room,\r\nwhere a huge portrait of Queen Victoria, from the middle period of her\r\nreign, impassively--not without symbolic significance--looked down upon\r\nthe company.\r\n\r\nThere were at this time about sixteen legations in Peking, so that\r\nthe meetings were not too large for intimate conversation. The\r\nproceedings were usually carried on in the English language, partly out\r\nof deference to the Dean, and partly because English has come quite\r\nnaturally to be the international language of the Far East.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic corps in Peking meets frequently, and it has more\r\ncomprehensive and complicated business than falls to such a body in any\r\nother capital. Matters of diplomatic routine occupy only a subsidiary\r\nplace. Because of the system of extra-territoriality under which\r\nforeign residents remain exempt from Chinese law and subject only\r\nto that of their own respective nation, the foreign representatives\r\nin China are constantly concerned with the internal affairs of that\r\ncountry. The effects of any legislation by the Chinese Government upon\r\nforeign residents have to be considered by the diplomatic corps: if\r\nthe most punctilious minister discovers that the measure in question\r\nin any way transgresses that absolute immunity from local law which is\r\nclaimed, then objection will be made, and the unanimous consent, which\r\nis necessary to approve of such matters, is difficult or impossible to\r\nobtain.\r\n\r\nQuestions of taxation are constantly before the diplomatic corps, as\r\nthe Chinese local officials quite naturally attempt to find some way to\r\nmake the foreigners bear at least part of the taxation of a government\r\nwhose general protection they demand. The methods of proving claims and\r\ncollecting indemnities give rise to much discussion, whenever there has\r\nbeen some outbreak of revolutionary activity. As certain revenues have\r\nbeen pledged for international loans, the diplomatic corps will object\r\nto the Chinese Government using these revenues at all before they have\r\nbeen released as not needed for defraying the debt charges. One of the\r\nmost fruitful causes of irritation comes from attempts frequently made\r\nby one or the other minister to \"hold up\" the funds belonging to the\r\nChinese until they have fulfilled some particular demand which he had\r\nmade. The fact that it may be an entirely extraneous and irrelevant\r\nmatter, such as the appointment of a national of the minister to a\r\nChinese government job, does not seem to disturb the man who thinks\r\nhe has found a clever way to achieve his purpose. The international\r\nsettlement at Shanghai and the régime of foreign troops in Peking\r\nand along the Mukden Railway also give rise to a great many problems\r\nwhich are referred to the diplomatic corps. From questions involving\r\nthe recognition of the Government itself to such matters as the\r\nadvisability of bambooing prisoners at Shanghai, no question seems to\r\nbe too big or little to come before this body.\r\n\r\nThe discussions tend rather to avoid general issues and to confine\r\nthemselves to a statement and explanation of the position taken by each\r\ngovernment. Occasionally the stubborn and unreasonable adherence of one\r\nor two representatives to what is considered by others as an unduly\r\nsevere and exacting position, leads to joint efforts in an attempt to\r\nmake a more fair and liberal policy prevail. The discussions are not\r\ninfrequently longer than is necessary; the main points are lost sight\r\nof, and discussion becomes entangled, because one side may be talking\r\nof one thing, whereas the other has quite a different matter in view.\r\nUntil it is discovered that there is no real difference or only a\r\ndifference in form, much valuable time may be consumed. At times, these\r\nconferences remind one of a university faculty meeting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWeeks were filled with innumerable conferences on matters of business.\r\nIn China it rarely happens that the decision lies with only one\r\nofficial. In order to have a proposal accepted, a great many men\r\nhave to be consulted and won over. Impatient representatives, backed\r\nby strong national force, have frequently tried to cut short this\r\nprocedure, and, planting themselves before the official whose assent\r\nthey needed, have \"pounded the table\" until a promise was obtained.\r\nThey sometimes succeeded by so powerfully getting on the nerves of the\r\nChinese official that he saw no way to save his peace of mind but by\r\ngiving in. At one time I expressed great surprise to the Minister of\r\nFinance, because, instead of insisting that reasonable arrangements for\r\nthe renewal of a certain short-term loan should be made, he had given\r\nthe representative in question--the agent of a munition company--a\r\nlarge order for additional materials which were not needed, only to\r\nsecure an extension of time. He said, in self-defence: \"The manners of\r\nthe man were so abominable that I could not stand it any longer.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the method of the strong arm and mailed fist, while it has\r\nproduced results in China, has also carried in itself the elements\r\nof its own defeat. The Chinese may make a concession under such\r\ncircumstances, but they will thereafter have no interest whatsoever in\r\nfacilitating the business in question; on the contrary, it is likely\r\nto be delayed and obstructed at every point, so that it can be carried\r\nout only through constant pressure and show of force. The people of\r\nChina have a strong and widespread sense of equity. He who proposes a\r\nreasonable arrangement and gives himself the trouble to talk it over\r\nwith officials and other men concerned, in the spirit of arriving at\r\na solution fair to all, will build on a sound foundation. Whenever\r\nforeign interests have acted on this principle, the results have been\r\nfar more fruitful of good than where things have been carried through\r\nwith a high hand by demand and threat, without reasoning or give and\r\ntake. But to sit in conference with various people on all the phases\r\nof any proposal is a great consumer of time. One is kept busy day and\r\nnight in following the roads and trails that lead to the final meeting\r\nof minds from which action is to result.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had a visit from the Tuchun Tien, of Kalgan, after my return from\r\nAmerica in the fall of 1918. I found that the Tuchun was in very bad\r\ngrace at the American Legation. He had interfered with an automobile\r\nservice which an American had tried to establish between Kalgan and\r\nUrga, in Mongolia, and had in other ways shown an apparent hostility to\r\nlegitimate American enterprise. As the writing of notes had not secured\r\nany satisfactory results, I began to probe into the situation to find\r\nwhat lay back of the attitude of the general.\r\n\r\nI found that he was \"blood-brother\" of Mr. Pan Fu, whom in turn I\r\nnumbered among my friends. I therefore consulted Mr. Pan Fu about\r\nthe situation. He said that there must be some misunderstanding, as\r\nthe General was certainly not animated by any feeling of hostility\r\nto America; but that it was possible that the particular American\r\nin Kalgan had rubbed him the wrong way. So he promised to write the\r\nGeneral a long letter.\r\n\r\nA short time later he called on me and reported that General Tien\r\nhad written him that he was soon coming to Peking and would be very\r\nglad to meet me. The Tuchun soon called on me, with Mr. Chow Tsu-chi,\r\nand we had a most friendly talk. Very little was said about any past\r\ndifficulties in Kalgan, but a great deal about future prospects of\r\ngoodwill and mutual help. In fact, our friendship was quite firmly\r\nestablished, and there was no further room for misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nTuchun Tien was an open-faced, friendly looking person who, though he\r\nhad straggling side whiskers unusual with the Chinese, had nothing of\r\nthe berserker in his bearing. Our conversation was long and cordial.\r\nWhen it had already lasted more than an hour, Mr. Chow looked at me\r\napologetically and said, in English: \"We had better let him talk, it\r\ndoes him good.\" As for myself, I was glad to hear his views.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Reinsch and I gave a dinner to Mr. Robert Gailey of the Y.M.C.A.\r\non the eve of his departure for America. About thirty guests were\r\npresent, all members of the American mission societies in Peking. I had\r\njust entered the reception room to be ready to welcome our guests when\r\nmuch to my surprise Prince Pu Lun was ushered in. It was evident that\r\nthere had been some mistake about invitations, but as there appeared\r\nto be no other dinner given at the Legation, I made no effort to clear\r\nup the error and tried to make him thoroughly welcome. I had the table\r\nrearranged so as to seat the Prince between two ladies both of whom\r\nspoke Chinese very well. He appeared to be surprised at the composition\r\nof the company and the absence of wines, but was apparently well\r\nentertained by his neighbours. When the dinner was about half through,\r\nKao, the head boy, came to the back of my chair and whispered to me:\r\n\"Mrs. Lee's boy outside. Say Prince belong Mrs. Lee dinner.\" So after\r\ndinner I felt in duty bound to tell the Prince that Mrs. Lee had sent\r\nword that she would be very happy if he could come to her house in the\r\ncourse of the evening.\r\n\r\nAfter a short conversation, in which he told me about his children\r\nof whom he is very fond, the Prince departed, to recoup himself at\r\nthe house of the navy doctor for the abstinences laid upon him at the\r\nminister's dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE PASSING OF YUAN SHIH-KAI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE WAR: JAPAN IN SHANTUNG\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 8, 1914, Japanese war vessels appeared near Tsingtau. Japan\r\nsuggested on August 10th that the British Government might call for\r\nthe coöperation of Japan under the terms of the Alliance. In view of\r\npossible consequences the British Government hesitated to make the\r\ncall; the British in China considered it important that independent\r\naction by Japan in that country should be precluded.\r\n\r\nActing on its own account on August 15th, the Japanese Government sent\r\nthe Shantung ultimatum to Germany. The British Government was then\r\ninformed of the action taken. The German representative at Peking\r\nhad discussed informally with the Foreign Office the possibility of\r\nimmediately returning Kiaochow directly to China; but the Chinese\r\nGovernment was now pointedly warned by the Japanese that no such action\r\nwould be permitted.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government then also seriously considered the policy of\r\ndeclaring war on Germany. It would have been as easy for the Chinese,\r\nas for any one else, to take Kiaochow from the Germans, but Japan was\r\nready and anticipated them. In fact, the Japanese minister stated to\r\nthe Chinese Foreign Office on August 20th that the Kiaochow matter\r\nno longer concerned the Chinese Government, which, he trusted, would\r\nremain absolutely passive in regard to it. The ultimatum to Germany,\r\nlimited to August 23rd, demanded the delivery, at a date not later than\r\nSeptember 15th of the leased territory of Kiaochow to the Japanese\r\nGovernment, \"with a view to the eventual restoration of the same to\r\nChina.\"\r\n\r\nBasing its action upon the language of this ultimatum, the American\r\nGovernment on August 19th made a communication to the Japanese Foreign\r\nOffice, noting with satisfaction that Japan demanded the surrender of\r\nKiaochow with the purpose of restoring that tract to China, and that it\r\nwas seeking no territorial aggrandizement in China.\r\n\r\nOn my return to Peking on September 30th, I found the Chinese in a\r\nstate of natural excitement over the action taken by Japan. By this\r\ntime the Japanese had invested Tsingtau; the British, who had also\r\nsent a contingent of troops, were kept by the Japanese in a very\r\nsubsidiary position. The scope of Japan's plans was more fully revealed\r\non September 29th, when the Chinese Government was informed that\r\n\"military necessity\" required the Japanese Government to place troops\r\nalong the entire railway in Shantung Province. As this railway had\r\nnever had German military guards, and as the portion near Tsingtau was\r\nalready held by Japanese troops, the military necessity of such further\r\noccupation was by no means apparent.\r\n\r\nMr. Liang Tun-yen, Minister of Communications, called on me on\r\nOctober 1st, expressing deep concern over the action of the Japanese\r\nin Shantung. He stated his conviction that, in departing from the\r\nnecessary military operations around Tsingtau, it was Japan's plan\r\nto stir up trouble in the interior of China with a view to more\r\nextensive occupation of Chinese territory. From Japanese sources he\r\nhad information to the effect that the Japanese militarists were\r\nnot satisfied with the reduction of Tsingtau, but wished to take\r\nadvantage of this opportunity to secure a solid footing--political\r\nand military--within the interior of China. He was further informed\r\nthat they were ready to let loose large numbers of bandits and other\r\nirresponsible persons to coöperate with revolutionary elements in an\r\nattempt to create widespread uprisings, in order to furnish a pretext\r\nfor military interference. When I called attention to the declarations\r\nregarding Kiaochow in Japan's ultimatum to Germany, the minister shook\r\nhis head and said: \"Unfortunately, Japanese policy cannot be judged\r\nby such professions, but only by the acts of the last twenty years,\r\nwhich make up a series of broken pledges and attacks upon the rights of\r\nChina.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Yuan Shih-kai had wished to see me; so I called on him\r\ninformally on October 2nd. In stronger terms than Minister Liang he\r\nset forth his apprehensions. \"From information in my possession,\"\r\nhe stated, \"I am convinced that the Japanese have a definite and\r\nfar-reaching plan for using the European crisis to further an attempt\r\nto lap the foundations of control over China. In this, the control of\r\nShantung through the possession of the port and the railway is to be\r\nthe foundation stone. Their policy was made quite apparent through the\r\nthreatened occupation of the entire Shantung Railway, which goes far\r\nbeyond anything the Germans ever attempted in Shantung Province. It\r\nwill bring the Japanese military forces to the very heart of China.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon Yuan Shih-kai requested that I ask President Wilson to use\r\nhis good offices in conferring with the British Government, in order to\r\nprevail upon Japan to restrict her action in Shantung to the military\r\nnecessities involved in the capture of Tsingtau, according to the\r\noriginal assurances given the Chinese Government. I communicated this\r\nrequest to the President through the Department of State.\r\n\r\nWith great promptness, however, the Japanese executed the plan they\r\nhad adopted. They informed the Chinese that, being judges of their own\r\nmilitary necessities, they would occupy the railway by _force majeure_\r\nimmediately, but would leave its administration in Chinese hands--with\r\nthe stipulation that Japanese conductors be placed on the trains. The\r\nChinese found no means to resist this arrangement.\r\n\r\nMr. Eki Hioki, successor of Minister Yamaza, had arrived during the\r\nsummer. He had for many years been minister in Chile, where I had met\r\nhim in 1910; remembering his genial and sociable qualities, I was happy\r\nto renew this acquaintance. Mr. Hioki differed from his predecessor in\r\nhis readiness to talk freely and abundantly. In our first conversation,\r\nwhen the relations between the United States and Japan came up, he\r\nadduced the customary argument that as the United States was preventing\r\nthe Japanese from settling in America, we could not in fairness\r\nobject if Japan tried to develop her activities and influence on the\r\nAsian continent. I could honestly assure him that American goodwill\r\ndid go out in full measure to any legitimate development of Japanese\r\nenterprise and prosperity, but we also had duties toward our own\r\ncitizens, who had been active in Chinese trade for more than 130 years,\r\nas well as toward China herself. We could not be expected to approve\r\nany action which would not respect the rights of these.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese people were becoming more and more alarmed about Japan in\r\nShantung. The large number of petitions and manifestoes which came to\r\nme, as the representative of a friendly nation, from various parts of\r\nChina, gave me an idea of how widespread was this anxiety. Some of\r\nthese protests were written with the blood of the petitioner.\r\n\r\nCount Okuma's declaration, that a large increase in the military forces\r\nof Japan was needed to preserve peace in the Far East, was interpreted\r\nas meaning that Japan would take the present opportunity to make\r\ngood her actual domination throughout eastern Asia. The Chinese felt\r\nthat any understanding with Japan would inevitably lead to the total\r\nsubjection of China to the political dominance of her neighbour. They\r\ndistrust all professions of Japanese friendship. Whenever I tried to\r\nargue that a frank understanding between China and Japan was desirable,\r\nI was told that China could not trust Japan; that Japan must not\r\nbe judged by her professions, but by her past acts, all of which\r\nshow a determined policy of political advance veiled by reassuring\r\ndeclarations.\r\n\r\nThus the Chinese feared Japanese intrigue at every point. They\r\nbelieved that revolutionary activities, as in the past, were getting\r\nencouragement from Japan. The Japanese were ready to take advantage\r\nof and to aggravate any weakness which might exist in Chinese social\r\nand political life. They would fasten like leeches upon any sore spot.\r\nThe tendency toward rebellion and brigandage, the counterfeiting of\r\nbanknotes, the corruption of officials, the undermining of the credit\r\nof important private and public enterprises, the furnishing of more\r\ndangerous drugs when opium was forbidden--in connection with such\r\nmischiefs individual Japanese had been active to the great damage of\r\nthe Chinese. But though it would be unjust, of course, to charge up\r\nthis meddling to the Japanese nation as a whole the connivance of their\r\nmilitarist government was a fact.\r\n\r\nThe British looked upon the new adventure of Japan with a decided lack\r\nof enthusiasm. While welcoming the losses inflicted on their enemy in\r\nwar, they were evidently fearful of the results which might come from\r\nShantung.\r\n\r\nIt was plain that the Russians, too, while allied with Japan, were\r\nquite aware of the dangers inherent in the Chinese situation. Taken\r\nwith recent Japanese advances in Inner Mongolia, a situation was\r\ncreated in northern China which would be regarded as dangerous by the\r\nRussians. Discussing the unrest in China, the Russian minister said to\r\nme significantly: \"The situation itself does not impress me as serious;\r\nthe only serious thing about it is that the Japanese say it is serious.\"\r\n\r\nIn fine, the general temper and direction of Japanese action was\r\nnot relished by the allies of Japan. Japan had taken advantage of a\r\nconflict which was primarily European, into the rigour of which she did\r\nnot enter, for the purpose of gathering up the possessions of Germany\r\nin the Far East and the Pacific at a time when they could be but\r\nweakly defended.\r\n\r\nThis policy of Japan deeply affected American prospects and enterprise\r\nin China, as, also, that of the other leading nations. Since the\r\nAmerican attitude of goodwill toward China had in the past been\r\nunderstood by the Chinese to imply a readiness to give them a certain\r\nsupport in times of need, large hopes were entertained as to what the\r\nUnited States would do. Rich and powerful beyond measure, she would,\r\nin the minds of the Chinese, help China to maintain her integrity,\r\nindependence, and sovereignty. Other nations, not a little jealous of\r\nthe past goodwill of the Chinese toward us, were not slow to point\r\nout that American friendship was a bubble which vanished before such\r\nconcrete difficulties as the violation of China's neutrality. But\r\nthe Chinese, after all, saw that it did not lie within the sphere of\r\nits action for the United States to come to the rescue with direct\r\npolitical and military support. True, the Chinese had encouraged\r\nAmerican activities in China. They had looked upon them as a safeguard\r\nto their own national life. Since they were conducted in a fair spirit\r\nand without political afterthought, the Chinese did hope and expect\r\nas a minimum that Americans would stand by their guns and not let\r\nthemselves be excluded by political intrigue or other means from their\r\nshare in the development and activities of China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE FAMOUS TWENTY-ONE DEMANDS, 1915\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Japan is going to take advantage of this war to get control of China.\"\r\nIn these words President Yuan Shih-kai summed up the situation when I\r\nmade my first call on him after returning from Europe in September.\r\nMany Chinese friends came to see me and tell me their fears. Admiral\r\nTsai said: \"Here are the beginnings of another Manchuria. Aggressive\r\nJapan in Shantung is different from any European tenant.\"\r\n\r\nEvents had moved rapidly. Tsingtau had been taken, German control had\r\nbeen wholly eliminated from the leasehold and the railway. The Chinese\r\nGovernment notified Japan that permission to use part of the Province\r\nof Shantung for military operations would be withdrawn, since occasion\r\nfor it had disappeared. This the Japanese seized upon as a calculated\r\nand malignant insult; it was made the excuse for presentation of the\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nThe blow fell on January 18th. The Japanese minister sought a private\r\ninterview with Yuan Shih-kai. This meeting took place at night.\r\nWith a mien of great mystery and importance the minister opened\r\nthe discussion. He enjoined absolute secrecy on pain of serious\r\nconsequences before handing Yuan the text of the demands. He made\r\ntherewith an oral statement of the considerations which favoured the\r\ngranting of them.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese, fearing greater evils, did their best to guard the secret.\r\nThey could not, however, keep in complete ignorance those whose\r\ninterests would have been vitally affected; also memoranda of important\r\nconversations had to be set down. As soon as I received the first\r\ninkling of what was going on, I impressed it on the Chinese that, since\r\nthe subjects under discussion intimately affected American rights in\r\nChina, I should be kept fully informed in order that my government,\r\nrelying on the treaties and understandings concerning Chinese\r\nindependence, could take necessary steps to safeguard its interests.\r\nThe Chinese were of course ready to comply with my request. My\r\nintercourse with Chinese cabinet ministers and Foreign Office members\r\nwas not confined to formal interviews and dinners. We exchanged many\r\nvisits during which we conversed far into the night, without wasting\r\ntime over formalities or official camouflage.\r\n\r\nIn the conversation in which he presented the twenty-one demands, the\r\nJapanese minister dropped several significant hints.\r\n\r\nThe minister then spoke of the Chinese revolutionists \"who have very\r\nclose relations with many Japanese outside of the Government, and\r\nhave means and influence\"; further, \"it may not be possible for the\r\nJapanese Government to restrain such people from stirring up trouble\r\nin China unless the Chinese Government shall give some positive proof\r\nof friendship.\" The majority of the Japanese people, he continued,\r\nwere opposed to President Yuan Shih-kai. \"They believe,\" he went on,\r\n\"that the President is strongly anti-Japanese, and that his government\r\nbefriends the distant countries (Europe and America) and antagonizes\r\nthe neighbour. If the President will now grant these demands, the\r\nJapanese people will be convinced that his feeling is friendly, and it\r\nwill then be possible for the Japanese Government to give assistance to\r\nPresident Yuan.\" Yuan sat silent throughout this ominous conversation.\r\nThe blow stunned him. He could only say: \"You cannot expect me to say\r\nanything to-night.\"\r\n\r\nQuite aside from the substance of the twenty-one demands, the threats\r\nand promises implied in this statement convinced the Chinese leaders\r\nthat Japan was contemplating a policy of extensive interference in the\r\ndomestic affairs and political controversies in China, making use of\r\nthese as a leverage to attain its own desires. The Chinese considered\r\nit an ominous fact that the paper on which the demands were written was\r\nwatermarked with dreadnoughts and machine guns. They believed that the\r\nuse of this particular paper was not purely accidental. Such details\r\nmean a good deal with people who are accustomed to say unpleasant\r\nthings by hints or suggestions rather than by direct statements.\r\n\r\nA Japanese press reporter called at the Legation on January 19th, and\r\nrelated his troubles to one of the secretaries. The Japanese minister\r\nrefused absolutely, he said, to say anything about what passed between\r\nhim and the President; therefore he had sought the American Legation,\r\nwhich might have knowledge which could help him. With his assumed\r\nnaïveté the man possibly hoped to get a hint as to whether a \"leak\"\r\nhad occurred between the Chinese and the American minister. But it was\r\nnot until January 22nd that I learned the astonishing nature of the\r\nJapanese proposals. Calling on one of the Chinese ministers on current\r\nbusiness, I found him perturbed. He finally confided to me, almost with\r\ntears, that Japan had made categorical demands which, if conceded,\r\nwould destroy the independence of his country and reduce her to a\r\nservile state. He then told me in general terms their nature, saying:\r\n\"Control of natural resources, finances, army! What will be left to\r\nChina! Our people are being punished for their peacefulness and sense\r\nof justice.\" The blow evidently had come with stunning force, and the\r\ncounsellors of the President had not been able to overcome the first\r\nterrified surprise, or to develop any idea as to how the crisis might\r\nbe met.\r\n\r\nAn ice festival was being given on the next evening at the American\r\nguard skating rink. Mr. B. Lenox Simpson sought me out and accosted me\r\nquite dramatically, with the words: \"While we are gambolling here,\r\nthe sovereignty of the country is passing like a cloud to the east. It\r\nis Korea over again.\" He had received accurate information as to the\r\ngeneral character of the demands. Two days later the representative of\r\nthe London _Times_, who had been out of town, asked me casually: \"Has\r\nanything happened?\" \"You may discover that something has happened,\" I\r\nreplied, \"if you look about.\" That evening he returned to me with all\r\nthat he could gather.\r\n\r\nAlthough these correspondents, as well as the Associated Press\r\nrepresentative, telegraphed the astounding news to their papers,\r\nnothing was published for two weeks either in America or in England.\r\nThe Associated Press withheld the report because its truth was\r\ncategorically denied by the Japanese ambassador at Washington. Its\r\nPeking representative was directed to send \"facts, not rumours.\" On\r\nJanuary 27th it was given out \"on the highest authority\" both at Tokyo\r\nand at Washington that information purporting to outline the basis of\r\nnegotiations was \"absolutely without foundation.\" Only gradually the\r\ntruth dawned on the British and American press. The British censor had\r\nheld up the reports for a fortnight, but on February 5th Mr. Simpson\r\nwrote me in a hasty note: \"My editors are in communication with me, and\r\nwe have beaten the censors.\" From 25th January on, the demands began\r\nto be discussed confidentially among members of the diplomatic corps\r\nbut publicly by the press in Peking. As the impossibility of keeping\r\nthe matter secret locally was now universally granted from this time\r\nhigh Chinese officials consulted with me almost daily about their\r\ndifficulties. The acceptance of these demands, of course, would have\r\neffectively put an end to the equal opportunities hitherto enjoyed in\r\nChina by American citizens; I therefore made it my duty to watch the\r\nnegotiations with great care.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese were avoiding any interference with the formal\r\n\"integrity, sovereignty, and independence\" of China; they were\r\ndeveloping special interests, similar to those enjoyed by Japan in\r\nManchuria, in other parts of China as well, particularly in the\r\nprovinces of Shantung and Fukien. They could place the Chinese state\r\nas a whole in vassalage, through exercising control over its military\r\nestablishment and over the most important parts of its administration.\r\nThere would be three centres from which Japanese influence would be\r\nexercised--Manchuria, Shantung, and Fukien. Manchuria was to be made\r\nmore completely a reserved area for Japanese capital and colonization,\r\nbut with administrative control wielded through advisers and through\r\npriority in the matter of loans. In Shantung, the interest formerly\r\nbelonging to Germany was to be taken over and expanded. A priority\r\nof right in Fukien was demanded, both in investment and development;\r\nthis would effectively bar other nations and would assimilate this\r\nprovince to Manchuria. The northern sphere of Japan was to be expanded\r\nby including Inner Mongolia. From the Shantung sphere influence could\r\nbe made to radiate to the interior by means of railway extensions\r\nto Honan and Shansi. Similarly, from the Fukien sphere, railway\r\nconcessions would carry Japanese influence into the provinces of\r\nKiangsi, Hupei, and Kwangtung. The Japanese interest already existing\r\nin the Hanyehping iron and coal enterprise, which was a mortgage with\r\nright to purchase pig iron at certain rates, was to be consolidated\r\ninto a Japanese-controlled company. Added to these was the significant\r\ndemand that outsiders be denied the right to work any mines in the\r\nneighbourhood of those owned by the Hanyehping company without its\r\nconsent; nor were they to be permitted, lacking such consent, to carry\r\nout any undertaking that might directly or indirectly affect the\r\ninterests of that company. This astonishing proposal sought to make the\r\nJapanese concern the arbiter of industrial enterprise in the middle\r\nYangtse Valley.\r\n\r\nGroup V consisted of the sweeping demands which would have virtually\r\ndeprived the Chinese Government of the substance of control over\r\nits own affairs. The employment of effective Japanese advisers in\r\npolitical, financial, and military affairs; the joint Chino-Japanese\r\norganization of the police forces in important places; the purchase\r\nfrom Japan of a fixed amount of munitions of war--50 per cent. or more;\r\nand the establishment of Chino-Japanese jointly worked arsenals, were\r\nembraced in these demands. The latter involved effective control over\r\nthe armament and military organization of China.\r\n\r\nSo stunned was the Chinese Government by the Japanese stroke that it\r\nmissed its first opportunity. It might have immediately given notice to\r\nthe friendly Treaty Powers of the demands, which affected their equal\r\nrights in China, as well as the administrative independence of the\r\nChinese Government.\r\n\r\nA member of the Foreign Office consulted me about the best method\r\nof dealing with the demands; I expressed the opinion--which was not\r\ngiven by way of advice--that the detailed negotiation of individual\r\ndemands, with a view of granting only the least objectionable, would be\r\nlikely to give most force to considerations of equity. Time would be\r\ngained; the other nations interested would come to realize what was at\r\nstake. If certain liberal grants and concessions should be made, China\r\ncould then with greater force refuse to create rights and privileges\r\nincompatible with her sovereignty. The situation would then be more\r\nfully and clearly understood by foreign nations.\r\n\r\nAs the negotiations proceeded the Japanese minister hinted to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs that the Japanese public looked askance\r\nat the present Chinese administration, because of the hostility\r\noften demonstrated by Yuan Shih-kai; still, this feeling might be\r\nconciliated. It might even be possible for the Japanese Government to\r\ngive President Yuan assistance against rebel activities. The sinister\r\nquality of this hint was fully appreciated. It was at this point that\r\nthe Japanese minister used the simile which promptly became famous\r\nthroughout the Far East. He employed this picturesque language: \"The\r\npresent crisis throughout the world virtually forces my government to\r\ntake far-reaching action. When there is a fire in a jeweller's shop,\r\nthe neighbours cannot be expected to refrain from helping themselves.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding powerful efforts on the part of Japan to enforce\r\nsilence by menacing China and by muzzling the press in Japan, accurate\r\ninformation got abroad; whereupon the Japanese Government presented to\r\nthe powers an expurgated version of its demands, from which the more\r\nobjectionable articles were omitted. Later on, it was admitted that\r\nthe demands of Group V had been \"discussed,\" and statements were again\r\nissued on \"the highest authority\" that these so-called demands were\r\nmerely overtures or suggestions, which violated no treaty and involved\r\nno infringement of Chinese territory and sovereignty. The Japanese\r\nLegation in Peking asked local correspondents to send out a similar\r\nstatement, which, however, was refused by them, as the true nature of\r\nthe demands was already known.\r\n\r\nThe British, who had more extensive interests at stake than any other\r\nforeign nation, had shown agitation. British residents and officials\r\nexpressed deep concern because their government, being necessarily\r\npreoccupied with events in Europe, could not give full attention to\r\nthe Far East. As the action of Japan had been taken under the ægis\r\nof the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, it seemed to the British that this\r\nwas being used to nullify any influence which Great Britain might\r\nexercise, as against a plan on the part of Japan to seize control of\r\nthe immense resources of China and of her military establishment.[2]\r\nIt was believed that some sort of communication relating to the demands\r\nhad been made to the British Foreign Office before January 18th. When\r\nthe expurgated summary came out, the _Times_ of London on February\r\n12th published an editorial article describing Japan's proposals as\r\nreasonable and worthy of acceptance; it was understood in Peking that\r\nthis approval related to the summary, not to the demands as actually\r\nmade. But the Chinese officials were apprehensive lest a ready\r\nacquiescence of public opinion in the less obnoxious demands might\r\nencourage Japan to press the more strongly for the whole list. As late\r\nas February 19th, the State Department informed me that it inferred\r\nthat the demands under Group V were not being urged. The full text of\r\nthe actual demands as originally made had now been communicated to the\r\nvarious foreign offices; but because of the discrepancy between the two\r\nstatements, they were inclined to believe that Japan was not really\r\nurging the articles of Group V.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese minister had at first demanded the acceptance in\r\nprinciple of the entire twenty-one proposals. This was declined by\r\nthe Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs. When the Japanese asked\r\nthat Mr. Lu express a general opinion on each proposal, he readily\r\nindicated which of them the Chinese Government considered as possible\r\nsubjects for negotiation. Forthwith the Japanese minister replied that\r\nthe expression of opinion by Minister Lu was unsatisfactory; that\r\nnegotiations could not continue unless it were radically modified. Mr.\r\nLu was evasive and Mr. Hioki on February 18th became more peremptory;\r\nhe informed Mr. Lu that the negotiations might not be confined to the\r\nfirst four groups--that the whole twenty-one demands must be negotiated\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nThereupon I telegraphed inviting President Wilson's personal attention\r\nto the proposals which affected the rights and legitimate prospects of\r\nAmericans in China. The President had already written me in a letter of\r\nFebruary 8th: \"I have had the feeling that any direct advice to China,\r\nor direct intervention on her behalf in the present negotiations, would\r\nreally do her more harm than good, inasmuch as it would very likely\r\nprovoke the jealousy and excite the hostility of Japan, which would\r\nfirst be manifested against China herself.... For the present I am\r\nwatching the situation very carefully indeed, ready to step in at any\r\npoint where it is wise to do so.\"\r\n\r\nShantung was first taken up in the negotiations. The negotiators\r\nwere: the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Lu Tseng-tsiang;\r\nthe vice-minister, Mr. Tsao Ju-lin; the Japanese minister, Mr. Eki\r\nHioki; and Mr. Obata, Counsellor of Legation. Vice-Minister Tsao had\r\nbeen educated in Japan, and was generally considered as friendly to\r\nthat country. The Japanese minister, genial in manner and insistent\r\nin business, was aided by a counsellor noted for tenacity of purpose\r\nand for a grim dourness. Point by point the demands on Shantung and\r\nManchuria were sifted. By the preamble to Group II, in the original\r\nversion, Japan claimed a \"special position\" in south Manchuria and\r\nin eastern Inner Mongolia. The Chinese took decided objection. The\r\nJapanese minister complained on March 6th of slow progress, giving\r\nthenceforward frequent hints that force might be resorted to. Finally,\r\non March 11th, the Chinese were informed that a Japanese fleet had\r\nsailed for ports in China under sealed orders.\r\n\r\nAfter agreeing to important concessions in Manchuria and Shantung,\r\nthe Chinese determined to resist further demands. Just here the\r\nAmerican Government gave the Japanese ambassador at Washington its\r\nopinion that certain clauses in the demands contravened existing treaty\r\nprovisions. For the Japanese ambassador had offered a supplementary\r\nmemorandum which substantially gave the proposals of Group V as\r\n\"requests for friendly consideration.\" They were \"mere suggestions\" to\r\nthe Chinese! This method of disarming foreign opposition imposed one\r\ndisadvantage--it would hereafter hardly do actually to use military\r\nforce to coerce China into accepting the \"friendly suggestions\"\r\ncontained in Group V. The only chance of getting these concessions\r\nwas to keep the other governments in uncertainty as to the actual\r\ndemands, that they might not take them seriously, and meanwhile to\r\nbring pressure to bear in order to force Peking to accept these very\r\nproposals. The Chinese would feel themselves abandoned by the public\r\nopinion of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese increased their military forces in Manchuria and Shantung\r\nduring the second half of March; for a time the movement stopped the\r\nordinary traffic on the Shantung Railway.\r\n\r\nThe new troops were \"merely to relieve those now stationed in\r\nChinese territory,\" it was stated. Military compulsion was clearly\r\nforeshadowed; and thus beset, the Chinese had by the end of March\r\nalmost entirely accepted the Japanese demands in Shantung and\r\nManchuria. I had a long interview with President Yuan Shih-kai on March\r\n23rd. He seemed greatly worried but was still good-humoured. He said:\r\n\"The buzzing gnats disturb my sleep, but they have not yet carried\r\noff my rice. So I can live.\" Then growing serious he went on: \"I am\r\nprepared to make all possible concessions. But they must not diminish\r\nChinese independence. Japan's acts may force upon me a different\r\npolicy.\"\r\n\r\nI wondered whether he was actually contemplating armed resistance.\r\n\"Against any action taken by Japan, America will not protest, so\r\nthe Japanese officials tell us. But the Japanese have often tried\r\nto discourage the Chinese by such statements,\" he added. \"They say:\r\n'America has no interest in the Chinese'; or, 'America cannot help you\r\neven if she wishes to.'\"\r\n\r\nYuan felt that if America could only say, gently but firmly: \"Such\r\nmatters concerning foreign rights in China, in which we have an\r\ninterest by treaties, policy, and traditions, cannot be discussed\r\nwithout our participation,\" the danger would largely dissolve.\r\n\r\nCertain possible solutions were now suggested by the Department of\r\nState. They aimed to bestow desired benefits on Japan, but also to\r\nprotect China and the interests of other nations in China. Personally,\r\nI felt that the demands of Group V should be wholly eliminated. Any\r\nversion of them would tangle, would more inextricably snarl, the\r\nalready complicated relationships of foreign powers in China, and choke\r\nall constructive American action.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese demands respecting Manchuria were substantially complied\r\nwith during early April; and the Chinese thought this part of the\r\nnegotiations closed. Not so the Japanese; they manoeuvred to keep\r\nopen the Manchurian question on points of detail. Meanwhile, they\r\npersistently injected Group V into the negotiations.\r\n\r\nFor over two months the negotiations had now gone on with two or three\r\nlong conferences every week. The furnishing of war materials, Fukien\r\nProvince, and pointed references to a \"certain power\"--meaning the\r\nUnited States--occupied the Japanese part of the discussion on April\r\n6th. The Japanese minister was strikingly peremptory in manner. Because\r\nof the pretensions of this \"certain power\" he must insist on the\r\ndemands regarding harbours and dockyards. Control, direct or indirect,\r\nof any naval base in Fukien must be frustrated, for the sake both of\r\nChina and of Japan. The present American administration might withdraw\r\nits \"pretensions\"; but what if they should be resumed in future? The\r\nonly safe course was to exclude this power from any possibility of\r\ngetting such a foothold. Meanwhile, local Japanese-edited papers harped\r\nupon the great influence which Ambassador Chinda was alleged to wield\r\nover Secretary Bryan. It would be futile to hope, they insisted, that\r\nAmerica might in any way assert herself in support of China.\r\n\r\nAt this time I informed the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs that\r\nshould the attitude or policy of the United States be mentioned by any\r\nforeign representative, and should statements be made as to what the\r\nAmerican Government would or would not admit, demand, or insist upon,\r\nthe Chinese Government would be more than justified in taking up such a\r\nmatter directly with the representative of the United States, through\r\nwhom alone authoritative statements as to the action of his government\r\ncould be made.\r\n\r\nThe American Government had filed with the Japanese strong objections\r\nto the granting of any special preference to any one nation in Fukien.\r\nIt had also emphasized the right of its citizens to make contracts with\r\nthe central and provincial Chinese governments, without interference\r\nand without being regarded as unfriendly by a third power. So far as\r\nharbours and naval bases were concerned, as stated previously, the\r\nAmerican Government did not object to any arrangement whereby China\r\nwould withhold such concessions _from any and all_ foreign powers. But\r\nJapan needed to allege some reason for making special demands with\r\nrespect to Fukien; therefore it alleged the machinations of a \"certain\r\npower.\"\r\n\r\nNo cause for apprehension existed. The talk of \"pretensions\" related to\r\nthe Bethlehem Steel Company's contract, made five years earlier, which\r\ndid not, however, touch Fukien, although a spurious version of the\r\ncontract, circulated in Peking shortly before, gave this impression.\r\nAn unfounded report spread by interested parties was thus made the\r\nbasis for a demand against the Chinese Government.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, what the Japanese had put forth for foreign consumption\r\nin the way of news was being compared with what was actually done\r\nin Peking. This annoyed the Japanese press, not so much because its\r\ngovernment had been caught in the act of trying to mislead its own\r\nallies, as because timely publicity and strong public opinion abroad\r\nwere defeating the attempt to impose its demands on the Chinese. The\r\nChinese relied on public opinion. It was their great desire, as they\r\noften said to me, that although the American people and its government\r\nmight not furnish material assistance it should at least know the\r\nfacts about the attack made on Chinese liberty; for they saw in the\r\npublic opinion of the world, and especially of the United States, the\r\nforce which would ultimately prevail. Even with Yuan Shih-kai, man of\r\nauthority though he was, this hope existed. Mr. Lu, the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, said to me: \"All that China hopes is that America and\r\nthe world may know and judge.\"\r\n\r\nFinally the _Japan Mail_, a semi-official Tokyo paper, published on\r\nApril 1st the full text of the Japanese demands in English. Thus was\r\nadmitted as a matter of course what had been categorically denied upon\r\n\"the highest authority.\" While the secret negotiations were going\r\non there was a byplay on the part of many official and non-official\r\nJapanese, who were evidently trying to create an atmosphere of\r\nantagonism to the Western nations. I received daily reports of\r\nconversations in private interviews, at dinners, and on semi-public\r\noccasions, in which Japanese were reminding the Chinese of all possible\r\ngrievances against the West, and picturing to them the strength and\r\nimportance that a Chino-Japanese alliance would have. Thus it was said\r\nmany times: \"Think of all the places from which we are at present\r\nexcluded. Should we stand together, who could close the door in our\r\nface?\" Or again: \"Are you not weary of the domineering attitude of the\r\nforeign ministers in Peking? They do not pound the table in Tokyo. They\r\nwould be sent home if they did.\" It was constantly repeated that all\r\nwould be well if only China would let Japan reorganize her material and\r\nmilitary resources. Visions of millions under arms, splendidly drilled\r\nand equipped--an invincible Chinese army officered by Japanese--were\r\nconjured up. To all such siren songs, however, the Chinese remained\r\ndeaf.\r\n\r\nA complete deadlock developed toward the end of April. The Chinese\r\ndesired to dispose of the grants concerning Manchuria. The Japanese\r\nwould not agree to anything definite without including the demands\r\nunder Group V. As a prelude to an ultimatum, the Japanese minister on\r\nApril 26th presented \"demands\" with respect to Shantung and Mongolia,\r\nunchanged except for the wording of the preamble; this substituted\r\nthe term \"economic relations\" for \"special position.\" With respect to\r\nHanyehping, they were softened to provide that the Chinese might not\r\nconvert the company into a state-owned concern, nor cause it to borrow\r\nforeign capital other than Japanese. Certain railway concessions were\r\nto be granted, and the most important demands under Group V were to be\r\nembodied into a protocol statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nMr. Lu pointed out that the railway grants sought conflicted with the\r\nconcessions already given to British interests; Mr. Hioki then proposed\r\nthat China grant these same concessions to Japan, letting Japan \"fight\r\nit out\" with Great Britain. With respect to Fukien, China was to state,\r\nin an exchange of notes, that no foreign nation might build dockyards\r\nor naval bases there, nor should foreign capital be borrowed for that\r\npurpose. Japan, therefore, abandoned her attempt to secure preferential\r\nrights in Fukien Province.\r\n\r\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs handed his answer to the Japanese\r\nminister on May 1st. The demands under Group V, Mr. Hioki was\r\ninformed, could not possibly be accepted by a sovereign power. With\r\nrespect to the other demands, a specific answer was given very closely\r\napproaching acceptance of the demands as revised by Japan. No railway\r\nconcessions were made, however, and it included certain technical\r\nmodifications with respect to the Manchurian demands. Everything asked\r\nwith respect to Shantung was granted, with the counter-proposal that\r\nChina take part in the negotiations between Japan and Germany.\r\n\r\nThis was conciliatory; nevertheless, the Japanese were moving their\r\ntroops. Everything indicated extreme measures. Japan's reservists in\r\nMukden had been ordered to their station, Japanese residents in Peking\r\nwere warned to hold themselves ready. At Tsinanfu, new entrenchments\r\nwere being built. When it was known that an ultimatum would be\r\ndelivered, the Chinese officials were perplexed and undecided. Should\r\nthey await its delivery, or try to placate the Japanese by further\r\nconcessions? The Chinese find it hard to obey a demand backed by\r\nforce; they are used to arrangements based on persuasion, reason, and\r\ncustom. To submit to positive foreign dictation would be the greatest\r\nconceivable _diminutio capitis_ for the Government. Chinese officials\r\nvisited me frequently. They seemed comforted in discussing their\r\ndifficulties and fears. I could not, of course, give them advice, but\r\nI expressed my personal conviction that Japan could hardly find it\r\nfeasible to include Group V--which she had explained to the powers as\r\nsuggestions of friendship--in an ultimatum.\r\n\r\nThe position of the American minister throughout these negotiations had\r\nnot been easy. The United States was the only power that had its hands\r\nfree. The Chinese expected its resentment and strong opposition to any\r\narrangements conflicting with Chinese independence and the equal rights\r\nof Americans in China. I could reiterate our repeated declarations of\r\npolicy and allow the Chinese to draw their own conclusions as to how\r\nfar our national interests were involved. But when the minister I saw\r\nmost frequently would ask: \"But what will you do to maintain these\r\nrights you have so often asserted?\" I had to be particularly careful\r\nnot to express my own judgment as to what our course of action should\r\nbe, in order not to arouse any hopes among the Chinese as to what my\r\ngovernment would do. Instructions had been slow in coming.\r\n\r\nIt was my personal opinion that America had a sufficiently vital\r\ninterest to insist on being consulted on every phase of these\r\nnegotiations. The Chinese had hoped that America might lead Great\r\nBritain and France in a united, friendly, but positive insistence\r\nthat the demands be settled only by common consent of all the powers\r\nconcerned. But the situation was complex. The state of Europe was\r\ncritical. The most I could do, and the least I owed the Chinese, was\r\nto give a sympathetic hearing to whatever they wished to discuss with\r\nme, and to give them my carefully weighed opinion. Our own national\r\ninterests were closely involved. It was my positive duty to keep close\r\nwatch of what was going on. While not taking the responsibility of\r\ngiving advice to the Chinese, I could give them an idea as to how the\r\ntactical situation, as it developed from week to week, impressed me.\r\nDr. Wellington Koo all through this time acted as liaison officer\r\nbetween the Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself, although I also\r\nsaw many other members of the Ministry. In discussing the consecutive\r\nphases of the negotiations, as they developed, Doctor Koo and I had\r\nmany interesting hours over diplomatic tactics and analysis, in which\r\nI admired his keenness of perception. Some objection was hinted by the\r\nJapanese Legation to Doctor Koo's frequent visits to my office and\r\nhouse, but his coming and going continued, as was proper.\r\n\r\nCouncils were held daily at the President's residence from May 1st on.\r\nInformally, the ministers of the Entente Powers advised the Chinese\r\nnot to attempt armed resistance to Japan; I believe the Government\r\nnever seriously contemplated this, although some military leaders\r\ntalked about it. Indeed, violent scenes took place in the Council;\r\nit was urged that submission would mean national disintegration. It\r\nwould rob the Government of all authority and public support, while\r\nresistance would rally the nation. The advance of Japan might be\r\nobstructed until the end of the Great War; then European help would\r\ncome. They pressed the President with arguments that Japan might,\r\nindeed, occupy larger parts of China; but this would not create rights,\r\nit would expose Japan to universal condemnation. However, in the\r\nexisting circumstances of World War, the Government feared that to defy\r\nJapan would mean dismemberment for China.\r\n\r\nThen President Yuan Shih-kai and the Foreign Office made their mistake.\r\nThey were panic-stricken at thought of an ultimatum. They were ready to\r\nthrow tactical advantage to the winds. Losing sight of the advantage\r\nheld by China in opposing the demands of Group V, they offered\r\nconcessions on points contained therein, particularly in connection\r\nwith the employment of advisers.\r\n\r\nBut when the Foreign Office emissary came to the Japanese Legation with\r\nthese additional proposals and the Japanese minister saw how far the\r\nChinese could be driven, he stated calmly that the last instructions\r\nof his government left no alternative; the ultimatum would have to be\r\npresented. This was done on May 7th at three o'clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese might have foreseen that the demands of Group V would not\r\nbe included in the ultimatum. Nevertheless, they were astonished at\r\ntheir omission, and annoyed at unnecessarily committing themselves\r\nthe day before. At first sight, the terms of the ultimatum seemed to\r\ndispose of these ominous demands. In the first sense of their relief\r\nfrom a long strain, the Chinese understood the stipulation of the\r\nultimatum that \"the demands of Group V will be detached from the\r\npresent negotiations, and discussed separately in the future,\" as an\r\nadroit way of abandoning these troublesome questions. They were soon\r\nto learn that their hopes were not in accord with the ideas of the\r\nJapanese.\r\n\r\nWhy, when the Chinese were virtually ready to agree to all the demands\r\nactually included in the ultimatum, should the Japanese not have\r\naccepted the concessions, even if they fell slightly short of what\r\nwas asked? Thus they would avoid the odium of having threatened a\r\nfriendly government with force; a matter which, furthermore, would in\r\nits nature tend to weaken the legal and equitable force of the rights\r\nto be acquired. The Japanese made two fundamental mistakes. The first\r\nwas in their disingenuous denials and misrepresentation of the true\r\ncharacter of the demands; the second, in the actual use of an ultimatum\r\nthreatening force. That these mistakes were serious is now quite\r\ngenerally recognized in Japan. Why they were made in the first place is\r\nmore difficult to explain.\r\n\r\nPossibly, in the light of subsequent events, when Yuan Shih-kai\r\nrealized that he must unavoidably make extensive concessions, he may\r\nhave sought a certain _quid pro quo_ in the form of Japanese support\r\nfor his personal ambitions. This would accord with the hint dropped by\r\nthe Japanese minister at the beginning of the negotiations. If this\r\nexplanation be correct, one might possibly understand that Yuan himself\r\nin his inmost thought preferred that he should be forced to accept\r\nthese demands through an ultimatum. The possibility of such motives may\r\nhave to be considered, yet from my knowledge of the negotiations from\r\nbeginning to end, I must consider utterly fanciful the charge made by\r\nYuan's enemies that it was he who originally conceived the idea of the\r\ntwenty-one demands, in order that he might secure Japanese support for\r\nhis subsequent policies and ambitions.\r\n\r\nA reason for the harsh measure of the Japanese Government is\r\nadmissible. The Japanese may have feared that public opinion throughout\r\nthe world, which was disapproving the character and scope of these\r\nnegotiations, would encourage the Chinese to hold out in matters of\r\ndetail and gradually to raise new difficulties. Moreover, the men who\r\nwielded the power of Japan were believers in military prestige and\r\nmay have expected good results from basing their new rights in China\r\ndirectly on military power.\r\n\r\nThe ultimatum gave the Chinese Government a little over forty-eight\r\nhours, that is, until 6 P.M. on May 9th, for an answer. On May 8th, the\r\ncabinet and Council of State met in a session which lasted nearly all\r\nday, finally deciding that the ultimatum must be accepted in view of\r\nthe military threats of Japan.\r\n\r\nIn their reply to the ultimatum a serious tactical mistake was made.\r\nI had been informed that it would be accepted in simple and brief\r\nlanguage; that the Chinese Government would say it had made certain\r\ngrants to the Japanese, which would be enumerated, making no mention\r\nof Group V. Toward evening of the 9th a member of the Foreign Office\r\ncame to me, quite agitated, saying that the Japanese Legation insisted\r\nthat the demands of Group V be specifically reserved for future\r\ndiscussion. \"What form,\" I asked, \"has the Chinese answer taken?\"\r\n\"This,\" he replied: \"'The Chinese Government, etc., hereby accepts,\r\nwith the exception of the five articles of Group V, all the articles\r\nof Group I, etc.' But,\" he added, \"when the draft was submitted to the\r\nJapanese Legation, they insisted that after the words 'Group V' there\r\nbe added the clause 'which are postponed for later negotiation.'\" It\r\nhad been thought necessary, my visitor explained, to state in the\r\nreply that something had been refused, in order to save the face of\r\nthe Government. But it is perfectly plain that if Group V had not been\r\nmentioned at all, the Japanese would have found it hard to insist upon\r\nits being kept open; for it could not be avowed before other nations as\r\npart of the matter covered by the ultimatum. As it was, the demands in\r\nGroup V were given the character of unfinished business, to be taken up\r\nat a future date. Thus portentously, they continued to hang over the\r\nheads of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nPartly in an exchange of notes, partly in a convention, the concessions\r\nexacted through the ultimatum were granted. None of these was ever\r\nratified by the parliamentary body, as the Constitution requires.\r\nBecause of their origin and of this lack of proper ratification, the\r\nChinese people have looked upon the agreements of 1915 as invalid.\r\n\r\nThe State Department had cabled on May 6th counselling patience and\r\nmutual forbearance to both governments. The advice was needed by Japan,\r\nbut the instructions came too late; the ultimatum had been presented. I\r\nshould have found that its delivery would have seemed like whispering a\r\ngentle admonition through the keyhole after the door had been slammed\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThe Department cabled on May 11th an identical note to both\r\ngovernments, which I delivered to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on\r\nthe 13th. It was published in the Peking papers on the 24th, together\r\nwith a telegram from Tokyo asserting \"on the highest authority\" that\r\nthe report of the existence of such a note was only another instance of\r\nmachinations designed to cause political friction.\r\n\r\nWhen he received the note Minister Lu said that he had tried throughout\r\nto safeguard the treaty rights of other nations, with which China's\r\nown rights were bound up. To a question from him I replied that\r\nthe American Government was not now protesting against any special\r\nproposal, but insisted that the rights referred to in the note be given\r\ncomplete protection in the definitive provisions of the Treaty. The\r\nnewly acquired privileges of the Japanese in Manchuria were touched on\r\nin the conversation; I pointed out that any rights of residence granted\r\nto the Japanese, by operation of the most-favoured-nation clause, would\r\naccrue in like terms to all other nations having treaties with China;\r\nthey ought to be informed, therefore, of all the terms of the agreement\r\naffecting such rights. On May 15th the Department confirmed this view\r\nby cabled instructions, which I followed with a formal note to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that the Chinese Government was comforted by an expression\r\nin which the United States in clear terms reasserted its adhesion to\r\nthe fundamental principles of American policy in the Far East.\r\n\r\nSo ended the famous negotiations of the Twenty-one Demands. Japan\r\nhad gained from the unrepresentative authorities at Peking certain\r\nfar-reaching concessions. But in China the people, as an anciently\r\norganized society, are vastly more important than any political\r\ngovernment. The people of China had not consented.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For instance, Putnam Weale wrote: \"Though Englishmen\r\nbelieve that the gallant Japanese are entitled to a recompense just\r\nas much now as they were in 1905 for what they have done, Englishmen\r\ndo not and cannot subscribe to the doctrine that Japan is to dominate\r\nChina by extorting a whole ring-fence of industrial concessions and\r\nadministrative privileges which will ultimately shut out even allies\r\nfrom obtaining equal opportunities.... In China, though they are\r\nwilling to be reduced to second place and even driven out by fair\r\ncompetition, they will fight in a way your correspondents do not yet\r\ndream of to secure that no diplomacy of the jiujitsu order injures them\r\nor their Chinese friends.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nGETTING TOGETHER\r\n\r\n\r\nThere arrived in Peking in the fall of 1915 the members of a commission\r\nsent by the Rockefeller Foundation, to formulate definite plans for a\r\ngreat scientific and educational enterprise in China. They were Dr.\r\nSimon Flexner, of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, of\r\nNew York; Dr. George A. Welch, of Johns Hopkins University; and Doctor\r\nButtrick, the secretary of the Foundation. By early September, 1919,\r\nthe cornerstone of the Rockefeller Hospital and Medical School in\r\nPeking had been laid.\r\n\r\nThe China Medical Board had acquired the palace of a Manchu prince.\r\nWhen their plans were first being formulated, the owner had just died,\r\nand this magnificent property could have been bought for $75,000 Mex.\r\nI cabled to New York at the time, advising quick action, but the\r\norganization had not been sufficiently completed to make the purchase.\r\nWhen, four months later, they were ready to buy, the price had risen\r\nto $250,000. The fact that a rich institution desired to acquire the\r\nproperty had undoubtedly helped to enhance the price; but real property\r\nwas then so rapidly rising in value all over Peking, especially in\r\ncentral locations, that the price asked, as a matter of fact, was not\r\nexcessive, and a similar site could not have been secured for less.\r\nA still further increase of values throughout the central portion of\r\nthe city was soon recorded; in fact, in many localities of China land\r\nvalues have risen after the manner of an American boom town.\r\n\r\nThe stately halls of the palace had been dismantled and torn down\r\nbecause they did not suit the uses of the hospital. The materials\r\nrecovered, however, were in themselves of great value. The Board had\r\ndecided, in consonance with the judgment of the architects, that\r\nthe Chinese style of architecture should be used, modified only\r\nsufficiently to answer the modern purpose of the buildings.\r\n\r\nWe gathered on a sunny day of early September, when the air of Peking\r\nhas the fresh balminess of spring, to dedicate the cornerstone of the\r\nfirst building to be erected. Admiral Knight, who was visiting us at\r\nthe time, accompanied me. Mr. Alston, the British chargé; Dr. Frank\r\nBillings, who had just returned from Russia where he had been chairman\r\nof the American Red Cross; and other representatives of the American\r\nand British community were present, together with many Chinese. Mr. Fan\r\nYuen-lin, Minister of Education, represented the Chinese Government,\r\nand Bishop Norris, of the Anglican Church, offered prayer. I made a\r\nbrief address in which I paid tribute to the achievements of American\r\nand British medical missionaries, and expressed my high idea of the\r\nvalue and significance, for science and human welfare, of the great\r\ninstitution here to be established.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, it had seemed to me--and I so expressed to Doctors Welch\r\nand Flexner during their visit--that much of value might be found in\r\nthe Chinese _materia medica_. In my own experience there had been so\r\nmany instances where relief had been afforded in apparently hopeless\r\ncases that I thought it worthy of special study. For example, a new\r\nchauffeur whom I had engaged accompanied my old chauffeur in the\r\nmachine one day; as he jumped out, his arm was caught between the door\r\nand a telegraph pole and crushed. We immediately had him taken to the\r\nhospital, where the doctors decided that only an immediate operation\r\nafforded any prospect of saving his arm, and that even a successful\r\noperation was doubtful. I was told that evening that his mother had\r\ntaken the young man away, notwithstanding the entreaties of our Chinese\r\nlegation personnel. We gave him up for lost. But within six weeks he\r\nreported for his position, only admitting: \"My arm is still a little\r\nweak.\" A Chinese doctor had cured him with poultices.\r\n\r\nSimilar cases often came to my attention. Mr. Chow Tzu-chi had\r\nfrequently suffered severely from rheumatism. He had tried every\r\nscientific remedy without avail. One day I was glad to find him chipper\r\nand in fine spirits. He said, \"I am cured\"; and he told me that a\r\nChinese doctor had fixed golden needles in different parts of his\r\nbody. Within a day his pains had disappeared. The empirical knowledge\r\naccumulated by Chinese doctors through thousands of years may be worth\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nIn their hours of leisure from the scientific tasks of their mission,\r\nthe members of the Rockefeller board saw much of Chinese life on\r\nthe lighter as well as its more serious side. One evening we went\r\ntogether to a Chinese restaurant where we met some native friends and\r\nhad an excellent dinner, of the best that Peking cooking affords. The\r\nAmerican guests were delighted with the turmoil in the courts of a\r\nPeking restaurant. We were entertained after dinner by a well-known\r\nprestidigitator. This man often performs in Peking, where he is\r\nknown among foreigners by the name of Ega Lang Tang. These words\r\nmean nothing, being only an arbitrary formula which he uses in his\r\nincantations. His tricks, many and astounding, culminate when, after\r\nturning a somersault, he suddenly produces out of nothing a glass bowl\r\nas large as a washtub two feet in diameter filled with water in which\r\nshoals of fish are gaily swimming about.\r\n\r\nIn another way American initiative of an educational nature was\r\nwelcomed in Peking. Among officials and literary men were many who were\r\ninterested in the scientific study of economic and political subjects.\r\nWith them and with American and European friends I had often discussed\r\nthe desirability of establishing an association devoted to such work.\r\nThe old literary learning which had up to a very recent time organized\r\nand given cohesion to Chinese intellectual life had largely lost its\r\npower to satisfy men, whereas the scientific learning of the West\r\nhad not yet become sufficiently strong to act as the chief bond of\r\nintellectual fellowship.\r\n\r\nAs all political and social action, and all systematic effort in\r\nindustry and commerce, depend on intellectual forces, it is evident\r\nthat disorganization and confusion would soon threaten Chinese life\r\nunless centres were formed in which the old could be brought into\r\nharmonious and organic relationship with the new, so as to focus\r\nintellectual effort. Such centres would wield great influence.\r\n\r\nWith the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Lu Tsen-tsiang, and a number\r\nof other friends who were equally impressed with the need for such a\r\ncentre of thought and discussion, we decided in November, 1917, to take\r\nsteps toward forming a Chinese Social and Political Science Association.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting was held at the residence of the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs on December 5, 1915, when plans were discussed. In an address\r\nwhich I made on this occasion I expressed my idea of the significance\r\nof the society as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The founding of the Society is an indication of the entry of China\r\ninto full coöperation in modern scientific work. This initial step\r\nforeshadows a continuous effort through which the experience and\r\nknowledge of China will be made scientifically available to the world\r\nat large. The voice of China will be heard, her experience considered,\r\nand her institutions understood by the world at large; she will be\r\nrepresented in the scientific councils. At home the work of such an\r\nassociation, if successful, should result in a clearer conception of\r\nnational character and destiny. The knowledge gained by its work would\r\nbe of great value in constructive administrative reform. But its\r\ngreatest service would lie in the manner in which it would contribute\r\nto a more deep and more definite national self-consciousness....\"\r\n\r\nVirtually all the Chinese officials, of modern education, as well as\r\nmany teachers and publicists, interested themselves in the new society.\r\nThe idea was supported by men of all nations; alongside of Americans\r\nlike Doctor Goodnow, Doctors W.W. and W.F. Willoughby, and Dr. Henry\r\nC. Adams, were the British, Dr. George Morrison, Sir Robert Bredon,\r\nProfessor Bevan, and Mr. B. Lenox Simpson; the French, M. Mazot and\r\nM. Padoux; the Russians, M. Konovalov and Baron Staël-Holstein; and\r\nthe Japanese, Professor Ariga. The society thereafter held regular\r\nmeetings, at which valuable addresses and discussions were given; it\r\npublished a quarterly review, and it established the first library in\r\nPeking for the use of officials, students, and the public in general.\r\n\r\nThrough the assistance of the Prime Minister, Mr. Hsu Hsi-chang, a\r\nportion of the Imperial City was set aside for use by the library--a\r\ncentrally situated enclosure, called the Court of the Guardian\r\nGods. This had been used as a depository for all the paraphernalia\r\nof Imperial ceremonies, such as lanterns, banners, emblems, state\r\ncarriages, and catafalques. When I first visited it, large stores of\r\nthese objects still remained. They were not of a substantial kind, but\r\nsuch as are constructed or made over specially for each occasion; and,\r\nwhile they were quite interesting, they had no intrinsic value. That\r\nthe officials and the Imperial Family should combine to set aside so\r\nvaluable an area for a modern scientific purpose was an indication that\r\nChina is moving.\r\n\r\nAttached to the French Legation was the brilliant sinologist Paul\r\nPelliot, whose explorations in Turkestan had secured such great\r\ntreasures for the French museums and the Bibliothèque Nationale.\r\nThough he acted officially as military attaché, M. Pelliot really had a\r\nfar broader function, being liaison officer between French and Chinese\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nBefore the war the Germans had an educational attaché. On account of\r\nthe close relationship between Chinese and American education through\r\nthe thousands of American returned students, I strongly urged the\r\nappointment of an attaché who could give his attention to educational\r\naffairs. I was so pressed with other business that hundreds of\r\ninvitations to address educational bodies throughout China had to go\r\nunaccepted. If there had been an assistant who could have met the\r\nChinese on these occasions, he could have been exceedingly helpful to\r\nthem. But I was told from Washington that there was no provision for an\r\nattaché with such functions.\r\n\r\nThe intimate feeling of coöperation between the British and American\r\ncommunities expressed itself in many meetings, in some of which the\r\nChinese, too, participated. Thus, on December 8, 1917, there was held a\r\nreception of the English-speaking returned students. The Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs; a number of his counsellors; the British minister, Sir\r\nJohn Jordan, and his staff; the American Legation; the missionaries;\r\nall who had received their education in the United States or Great\r\nBritain, were here present. It was a large company that gathered in the\r\nhall of the Y.M.C.A., including a great many Chinese women.\r\n\r\nThe hum of the preliminary conversation was suddenly interrupted by\r\na loud voice issuing from a young man who had hoisted himself on a\r\nchair in the centre of the room. He proceeded to give directions for\r\nthe systematic promotion of sociability and conversation. The Chinese\r\nguests were to join hands and form a circle around the room, facing\r\ninward; within that circle the British and American guests were to\r\njoin hands, forming a circle facing outward. At the given word the\r\nouter circle was to revolve to the right, the inner circle to the\r\nleft. At the word \"halt,\" everyone was to engage his or her vis-à-vis\r\nin conversation. To eliminate every risk of stalemate, the topics for\r\nconversation were given out, one for each stop of the revolving line,\r\nthe last being: \"My Greatest Secret.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man who proposed this thoroughly American system of breaking\r\nthe ice had just come out from Wisconsin, and it was his business to\r\nsecure the proper mixing in miscellaneous gatherings. The British\r\nseemed at first somewhat aghast at the prospect of this rotary and\r\nperambulatory conversation; yet they quite readily fell in with the\r\nidea, and when the first word of halt was given, I noticed Sir John\r\nduly making conversation with a simpering little Chinese girl opposite\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nA little later, in December, there was formed an Anglo-American\r\nClub, which celebrated its début with a dinner at the Hotel of Four\r\nNations. This was the beginning of the closest relationship that has\r\never existed between the Americans and British in the Far East. In my\r\nbrief speech I expressed my genuine feeling of satisfaction that this\r\ncoöperation should have come about.\r\n\r\nMy relations with educational authorities and activities in Peking were\r\nmost pleasant. When Commencement was celebrated at Peking University\r\nI had the distinction of an honorary LL.D. conferred upon me. This\r\ncourtesy was performed in a very graceful manner by Doctor Lowry, my\r\nwise and experienced friend, under whose presidency this institution\r\nhad been built up from small beginnings. I was so interested in the\r\npromise of this American university in the capital of China that\r\nI consented to act as a member of the Board, and I had interested\r\nmyself in its development as far as my official duties would permit.\r\nTo my great satisfaction, the university had at this time become\r\ninterdenominational, representing four of the Christian mission\r\nsocieties active in China. A liberal spirit pervaded the university,\r\ninspiring its members with a desire to serve China by spreading the\r\nlight of learning, without narrow denominational limitations, relying\r\non Christian spirit and character to exert its influence without undue\r\ninsistence on dogma. By a pleasant coincidence, I on that very date\r\nreceived a cablegram telling me that my alma mater, the University of\r\nWisconsin, had also given me the honorary LL.D.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity for general meetings of Americans and British,\r\nincluding, also, other residents of Peking, interested in things of the\r\nmind, was afforded by a lecture course arranged by the Peking Language\r\nSchool. I opened the course with an address on the conservation of\r\nthe artistic past of China, which was given at the residence of the\r\nBritish minister. Sir John Jordan in his introductory remarks said\r\nthat the time was at hand when foreigners residing in China would take\r\na far deeper and more intimate interest in Chinese civilization than\r\nthey had done before. I spoke of the danger of losing the expertness\r\nand the creative impulse of Chinese art and of the readiness it had\r\nalways shown in the past to develop new forms, methods, and beauties.\r\nSubsequent lectures were given alternately at my residence and at the\r\ntheatre of the British Legation, and the entire course emphasized our\r\ncommon interest in Chinese civilization.\r\n\r\nDuring the height of the student movement in 1919 the Peking police\r\nclosed the offices of the _Yi Shih Pao_ (Social Welfare), a liberal\r\npaper in Peking. The paper had made itself disliked by publishing news\r\nof the Japanese negotiations and criticizing the militarist faction.\r\nA number of Americans had previously interested themselves in the\r\npaper, because of its liberal tendencies and because of its devotion to\r\nsocial welfare work; they proposed to take it over, but the transfer\r\nhad not yet been carried out. The Chinese editor of the paper appealed\r\nto me to assist him in the liberation of an associate who had been\r\nimprisoned. As no legal American interest at the time existed in the\r\npaper, however, it was not possible to use my good offices in its\r\nbehalf, although I had at all times made the Chinese officials know\r\nthat the suppression of free speech in the press was a very undesirable\r\nprocedure. The suppression of the _Yi Shih Pao_ was a result of the\r\ndesire of the reactionary faction in Peking to choke every expression\r\nfavourable to the national movement; they had been encouraged to\r\nimitate the stringent press regulations of Japan.\r\n\r\nLater on the Americans completed their purchase of the _Yi Shih Pao_.\r\nThe question as to how far American protection should be extended over\r\nnewspapers printed in Chinese, but owned by Americans, then came up\r\nfor decision. As Americans had become interested in the _bona fide_\r\nenterprise of publishing newspapers in Chinese, it was not apparent\r\nhow such protection as is given to others for their legitimate\r\ninterests could be refused in this case. I therefore recommended to\r\nthe Department of State that no distinction be made against such\r\nenterprises, and several vernacular papers were subsequently registered\r\nin American consulates.\r\n\r\nWhen I told the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that American\r\nregistry had been given the _Yi Shih Pao_, I informed him of the\r\ncharacter of the American press laws, under which newspapers are in\r\nnormal times entirely free from censorship, but are responsible in\r\nlaw for any misstatements of fact injurious to individuals. Many of\r\nthe reactionary officials had persistently opposed the idea of having\r\nAmerican-registered vernacular papers in China. But, manifestly, they\r\ncould not make any valid protest against such an arrangement. In fact,\r\nwe never had any expression of official displeasure; on the contrary,\r\nnothing could have been more welcome to the people of China and to the\r\ngreat majority of officials than to know that vernacular papers were to\r\nbe published in China by Americans.\r\n\r\nThe publication in Peking of news from abroad was much facilitated\r\nby wireless. Early in 1919 I entertained at lunch several American\r\nnewspapermen, with whom I had a conference on the press and news\r\nsituation in the Far East. They were Mr. Fleisher, of the _Japan\r\nAdvertiser_; Mr. McClatchey, of the _Sacramento Bee_; Mr. Sharkey, of\r\nthe Associated Press; and Mr. Carl Crow, representative of the American\r\nCommittee on Public Information. Mr. Walter Rogers, an expert in this\r\nmatter, had been in Peking shortly before.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty with which we were confronted in any attempt to\r\ndevelop the news service between China and the United States was the\r\nexpense of telegraphing by cable, which made it impossible to transmit\r\nan adequate news service. We were therefore all agreed that it was\r\nessential to use the wireless and that every effort should be made for\r\narrangements whereby the wireless system of the American Government\r\nwould carry news messages at a reasonable rate.\r\n\r\nThe importance of a direct news service was demonstrated during the\r\nwar, when under an arrangement by the Committee on Public Information\r\na budget of news was sent by wireless daily to the Far East. For\r\nthe first time in history had there been anything approaching a\r\nfairly complete statement of what was going on in the United States.\r\nThe service of news of the Peace Conference was also particularly\r\nappreciated by everybody in China. China had never been so close to\r\nEurope before.\r\n\r\nThe only agency supplying news in China is Reuter's. Its news budget\r\nis made up in London. It proceeds to Spain, Morocco, and down the west\r\ncoast of Africa to the Cape; thence up the east coast of Egypt, Persia,\r\nIndia, and Ceylon. At each of the main stations on the way items of\r\nonly local interest there are withdrawn. What is left at Ceylon as of\r\ninterest to the Far East is sent on to Singapore and Hong-Kong, as well\r\nas by another route to Australia. It is quite natural that with such\r\na source and such a routing, this service should carry next to nothing\r\nabout America. I once had it observed for a whole month in June, 1916,\r\nwhen the only American item carried was that Mr. Bryan had shed tears\r\nat the National Democratic Convention!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nWAR DAYS IN PEKING\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring my first absence in America Mr. Peck had been appointed consul\r\nat Tsingtau, and Dr. Charles D. Tenney had been sent as his successor.\r\nMy predecessor, Mr. W.J. Calhoun, in a letter concerning Doctor\r\nTenney, bore witness to his unusual acquaintanceship with the Chinese\r\nand knowledge of Chinese affairs. Speaking of Doctor Tenney's joy in\r\nreturning to China, Mr. Calhoun remarked: \"There is a strange thing\r\nabout foreigners who have lived very long in China: they never seem to\r\nbe contented anywhere else. They are apparently bitten by some kind\r\nof bug which infuses a virus into their blood, and makes life in that\r\ncountry the only thing endurable.\"\r\n\r\nExistence of a state of war deeply affected social life in Peking.\r\nThe mutual enemies could, of course, not see each other. Their social\r\nmovements, therefore, were considerably restricted. The neutrals,\r\nhowever, having relations with both sides, were if anything more\r\nbusy socially than at other times. Dinners had to be given in sets,\r\none for the Entente Allies, the other for the Central Powers. The\r\nAustrian minister decided that as his country was at war and his\r\npeople were suffering, he would not accept any dinner invitations at\r\nall, except for small parties _en famille_. The other representatives\r\nof belligerent powers kept up their social life on a reduced scale.\r\nDancing was gradually restricted, and finally passed out almost\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nMr. Rockhill had died at Honolulu in December, 1914. He had been\r\nretained by President Yuan as his personal adviser, and was returning\r\nto China from a brief visit to the United States. I felt the loss of a\r\nman of such unusual ability and experience, to whom China had been the\r\nmost interesting country in the world. In all the difficulties which\r\nfollowed, his advice would have been of great value to the Chinese\r\nPresident and Government.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Engineers' Commission which investigated the\r\nHwai River Conservancy project made that enterprise look even more\r\nattractive than I had anticipated. The value of the redeemed land alone\r\nwould be more than enough to pay the cost of the improvements. I felt\r\nthat the work would give great credit to the American name. Not only\r\nwould it assure the livelihood of multitudes through the redemption\r\nof millions of the most fertile acres in China, but it would give\r\nto the Chinese a living example of how, by scientific methods, the\r\nvery foundations of their life could be improved. During the winter\r\nof 1914-15 a terrible famine was again devastating that region,\r\nthreatening hundreds of thousands of peasants with extinction. Never\r\nhad the sum of twenty millions of dollars produced such benefits as\r\nwould be assured here. But after urgent appeals to the Department in\r\nWashington, the National Red Cross, and the Rockefeller Foundation, it\r\nwas found impossible to secure the necessary capital during the year of\r\nthe option. The best I could do was to ask for an extension, which was\r\ngranted, although the Chinese themselves were impatient to see the work\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nWe received reports during the first winter of the war about the\r\nsuffering endured by German and Austrian prisoners in Siberia. They\r\nhad been captured during the summer and early autumn, and transported\r\nto Siberia in their summer uniforms. Subjected to the intense cold\r\nof a Siberian winter, they were herded in barracks unprovided with\r\nordinary necessities; these were sealed to exclude the cold and all\r\nkinds of disease were soon rampant. The Legation at Peking, being\r\nnearest to Siberia, superintended the relief work there of the\r\nAmerican Red Cross; there was also a German relief organization (called\r\n_Hilfsaktion_), of which a capable and enterprising woman of Austrian\r\ndescent, Madame Von Hanneken, was the moving spirit. The Legation's\r\nwork increased; innumerable appeals came to it directly, and in lending\r\nits good offices to the German association care had to be taken that\r\nno use of it be made that could be properly objected to. Madame Von\r\nHanneken was on friendly terms with the Russian Legation, which gave\r\nher society needed facilities. Its direct representatives were European\r\nneutrals, chiefly Danes and Swedes. The work of the American Red Cross\r\namong the war prisoners in Siberia, as well as the efforts of the\r\nY.M.C.A. to introduce among them industrial and artistic activities to\r\nalleviate their lot, make a story of unselfish effort.\r\n\r\nI tried to encourage the Chinese to build good roads. The Imperial\r\nroads around Peking were surfaced with huge flagstones which, through\r\nrain and climate, had lost alignment; they tilted and sloped at angles\r\nlike the logs of a corduroy road. Vehicles might not pass them, while\r\nthe Chinese carts picked their way as best they could over low-lying\r\ndirt tracks by the side of these magnificent causeways. The Chinese\r\nproverbial description of them is: \"Ten years of heaven and a thousand\r\nyears of hell.\" The country thoroughfares have worn deep; it is a\r\nChinese paradox that the rivers usually flow above and the highways lie\r\nbelow the surface of the land. In the _loess_ regions the roads are\r\noften cut thirty or forty feet deep into the soil.\r\n\r\nI first suggested the building of a road from Tientsin to Peking, but\r\nthe railways did not encourage this enterprise, and it was delayed\r\nseveral years. Mr. E.W. Frazar, an American merchant from Japan who\r\naccompanied me to Tokyo in 1915, had successfully established motor-car\r\nservices in Japan. He had come to north China to establish a branch\r\nof his firm there; he was willing to get American capital for road\r\nbuilding and to make a contract therefor with the Chinese Government.\r\nThis particular contract was not concluded, but an impetus had been\r\ngiven to the idea among the Chinese, and the building of roads was\r\ngradually taken up, beginning with highways around Peking. The leading\r\nmen became interested when they began to realize its effect on real\r\nestate values.\r\n\r\nGovernor-General Harrison of the Philippine Islands spent a week in\r\nPeking, sightseeing, making many purchases of antiques and Peking\r\nproducts. He was much taken with the Chinese rugs and ordered a number\r\nof huge carpets to be made for the Malacañan Palace. We both strongly\r\nfelt that something should be done to prevent the total disappearance\r\nof the American flag from the Pacific, and this we knew would occur\r\nif the existing companies carried out their threats of retrenchment\r\nand withdrawal. Had one been able to foresee the enormous demand for\r\nshipping which was soon to arise, he might have outdistanced the\r\nrichest of existing millionaires. The Chinese Government did give to\r\nan American a contract to establish a Chino-American steamship line,\r\nwith a government guarantee of $3,000,000; unfortunately, it shared\r\nthe all-too-common fate of American undertakings in China and was not\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nThe lunar New Year of the Chinese Calendar was changed to the\r\nRepublican (Min Kuo) New Year. On January 1st Peking was given a festal\r\naspect. The Central Park, a part of the old Imperial City, had been\r\nopened to the public, and under innumerable flags crowds streamed along\r\nthe pathways, stopping at booths to buy souvenirs and toys, or entering\r\nthe always popular eating places where both foreign and Chinese music\r\nis played by bands large and small. On various public places fairs were\r\nheld; extensive settlements of booths built of bamboo poles and matting\r\nsprang up overnight. There, curios, pictures, brass utensils, wood\r\ncarvings, gold fishes, ming eggs, birdcages, and other objects useful\r\nand ornamental were on sale. Wandering troops of actors and acrobats\r\nperformed in enclosures to which the public was admitted for a small\r\nfee. Before one of these stockades I saw a large sign reading: \"Chow\r\nand Chang--champion magicians educated _from_ America.\" So, even here,\r\nAmerican education was valued. The art collection in the Imperial City\r\nwas open at half the usual admission fee; the grounds of the Temple\r\nof Agriculture and of the Temple of Heaven were crowded with holiday\r\nvisitors, and at all theatres were special performances. For three or\r\nfour days the city wore a holiday aspect.\r\n\r\nBut the old New Year was not abandoned. On the days before the lunar\r\nyear ended the streets became alive with shoppers preparing for the\r\ngrand annual feasting. Quantities of fattened ducks, pigs, chickens,\r\nand fishes, loads of baked things and sweets were transported in\r\ncarts, rickshaws, and all sorts of vehicles or by hand, everyone\r\nchattering and smiling in happy anticipation. The Chinese New Year is\r\nthe traditional time for settling all outstanding accounts. Slates\r\nare wiped clean, partnerships are wound up, and all balances settled.\r\nWhen New Year's eve comes, having strained themselves to meet their\r\nobligations, all cast dull care aside. Families and clans gather for a\r\ngargantuan feasting, the abundance and duration of which outdistances\r\nanything seen in the West.\r\n\r\nThe official celebration of the Republican New Year at the President's\r\nPalace had to be modified. Because of the war the diplomatic corps\r\ncould not be received as a unit. It was therefore arranged that the\r\nPresident receive the foreign representatives in three groups: the\r\nAllies, the Neutrals, and the Central Powers. High Chinese officials\r\nand picturesque Mongolian dignitaries were received on the first day,\r\nthe diplomatic representatives on the second. As the President chatted\r\ninformally with each minister, Madam Yuan received in an adjoining\r\napartment, talking quite naturally with the ladies of the party about\r\nsuch feminine matters as the size of families and the choice of dress\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nA short time ago a young American teacher, Hicks, was murdered and\r\nhis two companions seriously wounded while they were ascending the\r\nYangtse River in a boat. The attack was at the dead of night; the\r\nsurvivors recalled only flaring torches and swarthy faces, although\r\nthey believed that their assailants wore some sort of uniform. The\r\nChinese Government disavowed responsibility, considering it an ordinary\r\nrobbery, and asserting that if the assailants wore uniforms they must\r\nhave been insurgents, as no regular troops were near that place. The\r\ncrime was revolting, destructive of the sense of security of foreign\r\ntravellers, and I insisted absolutely on payment of an indemnity.\r\nMoney payment is by no means satisfactory; it does give the injured\r\nparties redress and testifies to the desire of the Central Government\r\nto protect foreigners, but does not bring the consequences of the crime\r\nhome to the really guilty parties. I therefore always tried to have the\r\npersonal responsibility in such matters followed up and specifically\r\ndetermined; in this case it was impossible. The Chinese Government\r\nfinally agreed to the very handsome indemnity of $25,000 for the death\r\nof young Hicks, the largest pecuniary award for loss of life ever made\r\nin China. It was an ironical circumstance that just after this had been\r\nsettled, an American driving his automobile at excessive speed in the\r\nPeking streets struck and killed an old Chinese woman. When I stated to\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs that I would ask this man to pay $300\r\nto the relatives, he replied with a twinkle: \"How much was it we paid\r\nyou for the last American who was killed?\"\r\n\r\nHowever, he did not really intend to dispute the reasonableness of\r\neven so enormous a difference. Foreigners in China, on account of\r\ntheir employment as managers or head teachers, necessarily have to be\r\nconsidered, from a purely pecuniary point of view, to have a value far\r\nabove the average. Moreover, should large indemnities be paid for\r\nthe death of poor people among the Chinese, they would be constantly\r\ntempted to let themselves be injured or even killed, in order to\r\nprovide for their families.\r\n\r\nAmong the Chinese who visited me during the first year of the war were\r\nthe military and civil governors of Chekiang Province. Contrary to\r\ntradition, both were natives of the province they governed, and good\r\ngovernors, too. The civil governor, Mr. Chu Ying-kuang, who was under\r\nforty, was a man of great public spirit and wisdom, eager to discuss\r\nconstructive ideas and effective methods in government and industry.\r\nGovernor Chu wrote me a letter of thanks, which may be considered an\r\nexample of Chinese epistolary style. It ran:\r\n\r\n During my short stay in the Capital I hurriedly visited your\r\n Excellency and was so fortunate as to draw upon the stores of\r\n your magnificence and gain the advantage of your instruction. My\r\n appreciation cannot be expressed in words. You also treated me with\r\n extraordinary kindness in preparing for me an elaborate banquet.\r\n Your kindness and courtesy were heaped high and your treasures were\r\n lavishly displayed. My gratitude is graven on my heart and my hope and\r\n prayer is that the splendour of your merit may daily grow brighter and\r\n that your prosperity may mount as high as the clouds.\r\n\r\n I, your younger brother, left Peking on the 29th of last month for the\r\n South, and on February 2nd arrived at Hangchou. The whole journey was\r\n peaceful so that your embroidered thoughts need not be exercised. I\r\n reflect fondly on your refined conversation and cannot forget it for\r\n an instant. I respectfully offer this inch-long casket to express my\r\n sincere gratitude and hope that you will favour it with a glance.\r\n\r\n Respectfully wishing you daily blessings,\r\n\r\n  Your younger brother.\r\n\r\nThe new German minister, Admiral von Hintze, arrived shortly after\r\nthe New Year. I saw him frequently after his first visit, as he had\r\nfew colleagues with whom, under the conditions of war, he could meet.\r\nIn order to avoid capture as an enemy, Admiral von Hintze had come\r\nfrom the United States incognito, as a supercargo on a Norwegian\r\nvessel. He had been minister in Mexico, and before that the Emperor's\r\nrepresentative at the court of the Czar, and was a man of wide\r\nknowledge of European affairs and of diplomatic intrigue. For a man\r\nof his intelligence, he was inclined to give undue weight to rumours.\r\nPeking was amused shortly after his arrival when he sent orders to the\r\nGermans resident in all parts of the capital to hold themselves ready\r\nto come into the Legation Quarter immediately upon notice being given.\r\nHe had read books on the troubles of 1900 and on the assassination of\r\nhis predecessor, Baron Kettler; he therefore saw dire menaces where\r\neverything seemed quite normal to older residents. Especially, he\r\nimagined himself surrounded by emissaries and retainers of the enemy.\r\nSeveral times he would say to me: \"My first 'boy' is excellent. He\r\ncould not be better. The Japanese pay him well, so he has to do his\r\nbest to hold his job.\"\r\n\r\nBeing himself a clever man and familiar with opinion outside of\r\nGermany, Admiral Hintze thoroughly disapproved of the acts of\r\nunnecessary violence by which the Germans had forfeited the good\r\nopinion of the world, especially the sinking of the _Lusitania_ and the\r\nexecution of Edith Cavell. \"What a mistake,\" he exclaimed, \"for the\r\nsake of one woman! Why not hold her in a prison somewhere in Germany\r\nuntil the war is over?\" The stupidity of such acts deeply offended him.\r\nHad he become Minister for Foreign Affairs at an earlier date, some\r\nbad mistakes might have been avoided. When the first reports of the\r\nresumption of exacerbated submarine warfare were received, he remarked\r\nto me: \"Do not believe these reports that Germany will resume unlimited\r\nsubmarine warfare. I can assure you that they will not be foolish\r\nenough to do such a thing.\"\r\n\r\nI noticed soon after Admiral Hintze's arrival that his relations with\r\nhis Austrian colleague were not the most cordial; these two seemed\r\nto coöperate with difficulty. They were men entirely different in\r\ntemperament. The German was a man of the world, inspired with the\r\nideal of German military power and looking on international politics\r\nas a keen and clever intellectual game. Concerning Hindenburg, he said\r\nto me: \"There is a man who makes no excuses for his existence.\" The\r\nAustrian minister was a man of scholarly impulse, with a broad sympathy\r\nfor humankind, deploring the shallow game of politics, and hoping for\r\na more humane and reasonable system of government than that of the\r\npolitical state.\r\n\r\nMr. Sun Pao-chi, Minister for Foreign Affairs, resigned on January 28th\r\nto head the Audit Board, and was succeeded by Mr. Lu Tseng-tsiang.\r\nMr. Lu had enjoyed an extensive experience in Europe. He had acquired\r\na thorough mastery of French and married a Belgian lady, to whom he\r\nwas deeply devoted. Like his predecessor, he abstained from internal\r\npolitics. He was called to office when the exceedingly difficult\r\nnegotiations with Japan concerning the twenty-one demands were begun,\r\nand it became his duty to carry through a very painful and ungrateful\r\ntask. Mr. Lu was interested in general political affairs in their\r\nbroader aspects, and gave special attention to international law.\r\n\r\nI was frequently a guest at the house of Mr. Liang Tun-yen, the\r\nMinister of Communications. He was easy-going, prepared to talk\r\nbusiness there rather than at the Ministry, where I would see him\r\nfrequently also, about the Hukuang railways. The engineer of the\r\nBritish section was steadfastly trying to secure standards of British\r\nengineering and manufacture, to which it would be difficult for\r\nAmerican manufacturers to conform. The Legation was beset with protests\r\nconcerning orders for materials which Americans did not like, since\r\nthey embodied the special practice of one partner to the contract. Thus\r\nmatters of a technical nature had to be argued between the Legation and\r\nthe Ministry of Communications. Mr. Liang himself was not a railway\r\nexpert. For example, he once spoke enthusiastically about clearing up\r\nthe Grand Canal, exclaiming: \"then you could go from Peking to Shanghai\r\nin a houseboat.\" We often fell back on the more general features\r\nof the political situation in China, concerning which Mr. Liang\r\ndisplayed a gentle skepticism for all proposed reforms. With respect\r\nto railroad concessions, he was hostile to the idea of percentage\r\nconstruction contracts, believing it dangerous to measure the returns\r\nof an engineering firm by the sum expended on the works. I argued that\r\nsince the professional standing of such a firm was involved it could\r\nnot afford to run up the cost of the works merely to increase its own\r\ncommission. But I did not overcome his skepticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nEMPEROR YUAN SHIH-KAI\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yuan Shih-kai is trying to make himself emperor, we hear from Peking,\"\r\nMr. E.T. Williams remarked to me at the Department of State when I saw\r\nhim there in July, 1915. The report said that an imperialist movement\r\nin behalf of Yuan Shih-kai had been launched in Peking. As there had\r\nbeen frequent reports during the year of such attempts to set up an\r\nempire, I was not at first inclined to give much credence to the\r\nrumours.\r\n\r\nUpon my return to San Francisco in September, this time to take steamer\r\nfor China, I met Dr. Wellington Koo, who had just come on a special\r\nmission. I had been confidentially informed that he would probably be\r\ndesignated as minister to the United States, to take the place of Mr.\r\nShah. The Department of State had directed me to delay my departure in\r\norder to confer with Doctor Koo upon recent developments in China. On\r\nthe day we spent together we went over all that had happened since my\r\nabsence. The reports which had already been received that a movement\r\nhad been started to make Yuan Shih-kai emperor I then considered\r\nimprobable, in view of all the difficulties which the enterprise must\r\nencounter, both internationally and from the Chinese opposition. Doctor\r\nKoo confirmed this feeling and said that Yuan Shih-kai himself was very\r\ndoubtful. He mentioned the Goodnow memorandum, however, as a possible\r\nfactor. I was considerably surprised later to discover that the main\r\nobject of Doctor Koo's mission was to sound public opinion in America\r\nand Europe concerning the assumption of the imperial dignity by Yuan\r\nShih-kai, and to prepare the ground for it. During my return voyage\r\nto China the matter quickly came to a head, so that when I arrived in\r\nPeking on October 1st I was confronted with an entirely new situation.\r\n\r\nTo understand the movement it is necessary to review briefly the\r\nsignificant facts of Peking politics during the summer of 1915. A\r\nconcerted effort had been made to combat the Liang Shih-yi faction.\r\nThe opposition centred in the so-called Anhui Party, which was largely\r\nmilitaristic, but in which civilian leaders like the Premier, Hsu\r\nShih-chang, the Chief Secretary of the cabinet, Yang Shih-chi, the\r\nMinister of Finance, as well as the Minister of Communications, were\r\nprominent.\r\n\r\nCharges of corruption were lodged against Chang Hu, Vice-Minister\r\nof Finance; Yeh Kung-cho, Vice-Minister of Communications; and the\r\nDirector of the Tientsin-Pukow Railway. Including these, twenty-two\r\nhigh officials were impeached during July, besides several provincial\r\ngovernors. The Anhui Party was trying to eliminate radically the\r\ninfluence of the so-called Communications Party, which had tried to\r\nmaintain itself through the vice-ministers and counsellors of several\r\nimportant ministries, the chiefs of which were Anhui men.\r\n\r\nIt appears that several Anhui leaders were involved in a movement to\r\nestablish a monarchy, with Yuan Shih-kai as emperor. Care was exercised\r\nin picking the Committee of Ten to make a preliminary draft of the\r\nPermanent Constitution; it was believed by many that influences were\r\nat work for putting into that instrument provisions for reëstablishing\r\nthe monarchy. Report had it that on July 7th General Feng Kuo-chang,\r\nmilitary governor at Nanking, had urged that the President assume the\r\nthrone, for which he was rebuked by Yuan in severe terms. Dr. Frank\r\nJ. Goodnow, the American constitutional adviser, returned to Peking\r\nin mid-July for a short stay; he was asked on behalf of the President\r\nto prepare a memorandum on the comparative adaptability of the\r\nrepublican and monarchical forms of government to Chinese conditions.\r\nDoctor Goodnow complied. As a matter of general theory, he took the\r\nview that the monarchical form might be considered better suited to\r\nthe traditions and the actual political development of the Chinese. He\r\nsaw special merit in the fact that under the monarchical system, the\r\nsuccession to power would be regulated so that it could not be made an\r\never-recurring object of contention. On the expediency of an actual\r\nreturn at the time from the republic to the monarchy Doctor Goodnow\r\nexpressly refrained from pronouncing a judgment. The memorandum was\r\nprepared simply for the personal information of the President. Advisers\r\nhad been so generally treated as academic ornaments that Doctor Goodnow\r\ndid not suspect that in this case his memorandum would be made the\r\nstarting point and basis of positive action.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mr. Liang Shih-yi and his group, seeing their power\r\nthreatened, decided to do something extreme to recover the lead. They\r\nconcluded that the monarchical movement was inevitable; thereupon\r\nthey seem to have persuaded Yuan Shih-kai that the movement could be\r\nproperly handled and brought to early and successful issue only through\r\ntheir superior experience and knowledge. It was they who arranged for\r\nthe memorandum of Doctor Goodnow. They had remained in the background\r\nuntil the middle of August, when an open monarchical propaganda began,\r\nbased avowedly on the opinions expressed by the American adviser and\r\nthus given a very respectable and impartial appearance.\r\n\r\nThey formed the Peace Planning Society (Chou An Hui). Its aim was\r\nto investigate the advantages and disadvantages accruing from the\r\nrepublican form of government. Doctor Goodnow's views were widely\r\nheralded as categorically giving preference to monarchy for China,\r\nnotwithstanding disclaimers which he now issued. The fact that an\r\nAmerican expert should pronounce this judgment was cited as especially\r\nstrong evidence in favour of the monarchical form, since it came from a\r\ncitizen of the foremost republic in the world.\r\n\r\nIt became known in early September that the movement was in the hands\r\nof capable organizers. Notwithstanding Yuan Shih-kai's repeated\r\ndisclaimers, he failed to take positive action to suppress the\r\nagitation; he was therefore believed to be at least in a receptive\r\nmood. The high officials in Peking with few exceptions had become\r\nfavourable to the movement. The Vice-President, General Li Tuan-hung,\r\nwas at first opposed, but even he appeared to be reconciled at last,\r\nbeing not entirely a free agent. The members of the Anhui faction, now\r\nthat the lead had been taken out of their hands, were less enthusiastic\r\nfor the change. Several political leaders began to withdraw from\r\naffairs. General Tuan Chi-jui, the Minister of War, and Mr. Liang\r\nChi-chao, the Minister of Education, resigned, undoubtedly because\r\nof their tacit disapproval of the movement, although other reasons\r\nwere alleged.[3] The Premier and Mr. Liang Tung-yen, the Minister\r\nof Communications, though not on principle opposed, considered that\r\non account of his previous allegiance to the Imperial Family, Yuan\r\nShih-kai could not with propriety assume the Imperial office. Within\r\nthe inner circles of the movement there was no question of the desire\r\nof the President to have it put through. For a time, early in\r\nSeptember, he was even thinking of forcing the matter, but began to be\r\napprehensive regarding the action of certain foreign powers who might\r\nattach difficult conditions to their recognition of the new régime.\r\n\r\nIt was suggested that the Legislative Council might simply confer\r\nthe title of emperor on the President, and the constitution might\r\nthen be amended to make the presidency hereditary. Thus, it was\r\nnaïvely believed, legal continuity could be preserved sufficiently\r\nto obviate the necessity of seeking a new recognition. A republic\r\nwith a hereditary president seemed to some politicians the key to the\r\ndifficulty. This proposal served to direct the minds of those who were\r\nmanaging the movement to the importance of letting a representative\r\nbody participate in it, and of not carrying it through by a _coup\r\nd'état_.\r\n\r\nOn my return to China Mr. Chow Tsu-chi and other leaders waited on me,\r\nsaying that present uncertainties involved such drawbacks to peace\r\nand prosperity that from all the provinces the strongest appeals were\r\ncoming, to prevail upon Yuan to sanction the movement. Mr. Chow went\r\nso far as to say: \"There is such a strong demand for this step that we\r\nshall have great trouble if it is not taken. There will be military\r\nuprisings.\" When I looked incredulous, Mr. Chow proceeded: \"Yes,\r\nindeed, the people can only understand a personal headship, and they\r\nwant it, so that the country may be settled.\" Though I took this all\r\nwith a grain of salt, I was surprised at the apparent unanimity with\r\nwhich the inevitableness of the change seemed to be accepted. When I\r\nasked how the President would reconcile such a step with the oath he\r\nhad taken to support a republican government, I was told that this was,\r\nindeed, the great obstacle; that probably it could not be overcome\r\nunless the whole nation insisted and made it a point of duty that Yuan\r\nShih-kai continue to govern the state under the new form.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to reëstablish the monarchy seemed to me a step backward.\r\nI had always felt that, whereas the Chinese had no experience with\r\nelective representative institutions, nevertheless they were locally so\r\nlargely self-governed that they were fitted by experience and tradition\r\nto evolve some form of provincial and national representation. Yet I\r\nwas strongly convinced that it is under any circumstances injudicious\r\nfor one nation or the officials of one nation to assume that they can\r\ndetermine what is the best form of government for another nation. The\r\nfundamental principle of self-government is that every people shall\r\nwork out that problem for itself, usually through many troubles and\r\nwith many relapses to less perfect methods.\r\n\r\nThe Legation had during my absence asked for instructions about a\r\npossible eventual decision to recognize the new form of government.\r\nIt had suggested that acceptability to the people, and, consequently,\r\nability to preserve order, should be among the factors determining our\r\nattitude. This position had been approved by the State Department.\r\nIn the many conversations I had with the President and members of\r\nthe cabinet, I confined myself to expressing the opinion that the\r\nGovernment would strengthen itself and gain respect at home and abroad\r\nin such measure as it made real use of representative institutions and\r\nencouraged local self-government.\r\n\r\nThe Council of State on 6th October passed a law instituting a\r\nnational referendum on the question. Each district was to elect one\r\nrepresentative. The delegates from each province were to meet at the\r\nrespective provincial capitals and to ballot upon the question. The\r\nelection was fixed for the 5th of November, the date for balloting\r\non the principal issue on November 15th. Those desiring constructive\r\nand progressive action had allied themselves with the monarchical\r\nmovement. They hoped to strengthen constitutional practice and\r\nadministrative efficiency after the personal ambitions of Yuan Shih-kai\r\nhad been realized. With Yuan in the exalted position of Emperor, Mr.\r\nChow Tsu-chi explained to me, the government itself would be in\r\nthe hands of the prime minister and cabinet; they would carry it on\r\nconstitutionally and in harmony with the legislative branch. As Mr.\r\nChow put it: \"We shall make Yuan the Buddha in the temple.\"\r\n\r\nThe original promoters of the movement were not wholly pleased with\r\nthe efforts to engraft on it principles of constitutional practice\r\nand popular consent. As certain military leaders might resort to a\r\n_coup d'état_ on October 10th, the anniversary of the outbreak of\r\nthe revolution in 1911, the review of troops set for that date was\r\ncountermanded.\r\n\r\nMr. Liang Shih-yi and Mr. Chow Tsu-chi afterward explained to me\r\ntheir preference for the monarchical form. Mr. Liang said: \"Chinese\r\ntraditions and customs, official and commercial, emphasize personal\r\nrelationships. Abstract forms of thinking, in terms of institutions\r\nand general legal principles, are not understood by our people. Under\r\nan emperor, authority would sit more securely, so that it would be\r\npossible to carry through a fundamental financial reform such as that\r\nof the land tax. The element of personal loyalty and responsibility is\r\nnecessary to counteract the growth of corruption among officials. The\r\nChinese cannot conceive of personal duties toward a pure abstraction.\"\r\n\r\nWith President Yuan Shih-kai I had a long interview on October 4th.\r\nHe assumed complete indifference as to the popular vote soon to be\r\ntaken. \"If the vote is favourable to the existing system,\" he said,\r\n\"matters will simply remain as they are; a vote for the monarchy would,\r\non the contrary, bring up many questions of organization. I favour a\r\nrepresentative parliament, with full liberty of discussion but with\r\nlimited powers over finance.\" Education and expert guidance in the\r\nwork of the Government were other things about which he was planning.\r\n\"There is a general lack of useful employment,\" he added with some\r\nhilarity, \"on the part of the numerous advisers who hover around the\r\ndepartments. With an administrative reorganization all this will\r\nbe changed. These experts will be put to work in helping to develop\r\nadministrative activities.\" And he reverted to his favourite simile of\r\nthe infant: \"Even if we feel that all their medicine may not be good\r\nfor the child, yet we shall let them take it by the hand to help it to\r\nwalk.\"\r\n\r\nIt was plain that Yuan Shih-kai, while seeming very detached, was\r\ntrying to justify the proposed change on the ground of making the\r\nGovernment more efficient and giving it also a representative character.\r\n\r\nDoubtless Yuan Shih-kai had thought originally that the Japanese would\r\nnot obstruct the movement, though ever since the time of his service\r\nin Korea he had not been favourably regarded by them. His supporters,\r\nindeed, claimed that the assurances first given to Yuan by the\r\nJapanese were strong enough to warrant him in expecting their support\r\nthroughout. By the end of October, however, the Japanese Government\r\ncame to the conclusion that the project to put Yuan Shih-kai on the\r\nthrone should, if possible, be stopped.\r\n\r\nA communication came from Japan to the United States, Great Britain,\r\nFrance, and Russia, which expressed concern because the monarchical\r\nmovement in China was likely to create disturbances and endanger\r\nforeign interests. Japan invited the other powers to join in advising\r\nthe Chinese President against continuing this policy. The American\r\nGovernment declined this invitation, because it did not desire to\r\ninterfere in the internal affairs of another country. The other powers,\r\nhowever, fell in with the Japanese suggestion, and on October 29th the\r\nJapanese Chargé, and the British, French, and Russian ministers, called\r\nat the Foreign Office and individually gave \"friendly counsel\" to the\r\neffect that it would be desirable to stop the monarchical movement.\r\n\r\nThe British minister asked whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nthought disturbances could surely be prevented; whereat the Chinese\r\nrejoiced, believing it a friendly hint that everything would be\r\nwell, provided no disturbances should take place. As the machinery\r\nfor holding the elections had been set in motion, the Chinese leaders\r\nbelieved that any action to stop them would bring discredit and loss of\r\nprestige.\r\n\r\nThe final voting in the convention of district delegates at Peking,\r\non December 9th, registered a unanimous desire from the elections of\r\nNovember 5th to have Yuan Shih-kai assume the imperial dignity. Mr.\r\nChow Tsu-chi remarked to me: \"We tried to get some people to vote in\r\nthe negative just for appearance's sake, but they would not do it.\"\r\nPrince Pu-Lun made the speech nominating Yuan as emperor, which earned\r\nhim the resentment of the Manchus. On the basis of these elections, the\r\nacting Parliament passed a resolution bestowing on Yuan Shih-kai the\r\nimperial title, and calling upon him to take up the duties therewith\r\nconnected. He twice rejected the proposal, but when it was sent to him\r\nthe third time he submitted, having exhausted the traditional forms of\r\npolite refusal.\r\n\r\nWhen Yuan was actually elected Emperor, the Entente Powers were\r\npuzzled. They announced that they would await developments. The\r\nChinese Minister for Foreign Affairs informed them that there would\r\nbe some delay, as many preparations were still required before the\r\npromulgation of the empire could be made. But it was generally believed\r\nthat the movement had reached fruition. The Russian and French\r\nministers had already expressed themselves privately as favourable\r\nto recognition. The German and Austrian ministers hastened to offer\r\nYuan their felicitations, which embarrassed the Chinese not a little.\r\nThe majority of foreign representatives at Peking were favourable to\r\nrecognizing the new order on January 1st, when the promulgation was\r\nto be made. Messages of devotion and sometimes of fulsome praise came\r\nto the Emperor-elect (already called Ta Huang Ti) from foreigners.\r\nForeign advisers, including the Japanese but not the Americans, set\r\nforth their devotion in glowing phrases. Doctor Ariga, the Japanese\r\nadviser, expressed his feelings in the traditional language of imperial\r\nceremony. It was even announced that the new emperor had been prayed\r\nfor in foreign Christian churches. I could not, however, verify any\r\nsuch case.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, on Christmas Day, came the report that an opposition movement\r\nhad been started in Yunnan Province.\r\n\r\nA young general, Tsai Ao, who had for a time lived in Peking where he\r\nheld an administrative post, had left the capital during the summer\r\nand had coöperated with Liang Chi-chao, after the latter resigned\r\nhis position as Minister of Education. Liang Chi-chao attacked the\r\nmonarchical movement in the press, writing from the foreign concession\r\nat Tientsin. General Tsai Ao returned to his native Yunnan, and from\r\nthat mountain fastness launched a military expedition which was opposed\r\nto the Emperor-elect.\r\n\r\nSo the dead unanimity was suddenly disrupted. Now voices of opposition\r\ncame from all sides. The Chinese are fatalists. The movement to\r\ncarry Yuan into imperial power had seemed to them irresistible; many\r\nhad therefore suppressed their doubts and fears. But when an open\r\nopposition was started they flocked to the new standard and everywhere\r\nthere appeared dissenters.\r\n\r\nA small mutiny took place in Shantung early in December. In the\r\nJapanese papers it was called \"premature.\"\r\n\r\nA night attack was executed near Shanghai on the settlement boundary,\r\nwhich was participated in by several Japanese. Being easily suppressed,\r\nit was not thought important.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai had long been in training for the emperorship, he loved\r\nto use the methods of thought and expression of legendary monarchs.\r\nKeeping close to national traditions in the days of his power he always\r\ntook care to use words indicative of self-deprecation and consideration\r\nfor his subordinates. The members of the cabinet repaired on December\r\n13th to the President's house to offer their congratulations.\r\nReplying, the Emperor-elect said: \"I should rather be condoled with\r\nthan congratulated; for I am giving up my personal freedom and that\r\nof my descendants for the public service. I would find far greater\r\nsatisfaction in leisurely farming and fishing on my Honan estate than\r\nin this constant tussling with problems of state.\"\r\n\r\nWhen one of the ministers suggested that there should be a great\r\ncelebration of the new departure, Yuan Shih-kai replied: \"It would be\r\nbetter not to think of celebrating and of glory at the present time,\r\nbut only of work, and work, and work. My government should be improved\r\nand soundly established. In that case, glory will ultimately come, but\r\notherwise, if artificially enacted, it is bound to be shortlived.\"\r\n\r\nThese sayings were reported by his faithful ministers as being quite in\r\nkeeping with the character of a self-sacrificing, benevolent monarch.\r\n\r\nThe empire to be established was to be quite _comme il faut_; it\r\nwas to have a complete ornamentation of newly made nobility. The\r\nVice-President was to have the title of prince, and there were to be\r\ninnumerable marquises, counts, and barons. The military governors\r\nand members of cabinet were to become dukes and marquises, while\r\nthe barons would be as many as the sands of the sea. The attitude\r\nof Vice-President Li Yuan-hung was not quite plain. Aside from the\r\nprincedom he was also offered the marriage of one of his sons to one\r\nof Yuan's daughters. One of his wives seemed especially fascinated by\r\nthese glittering honours; she was said to have virtually prevailed upon\r\nGeneral Li to resign himself to the situation. The President was very\r\nkind to him and had supplied him with a bodyguard which watched his\r\nevery movement--for Yuan Shih-kai's information.\r\n\r\nNew styles of robes for the Emperor and for his high officials and\r\nattendants were designed under direction of Mr. Chu Chi-chien. They\r\nwere fashioned after the ceremonial robes of the Japanese Imperial\r\nHouse. The great coronation halls in the Imperial City were thoroughly\r\ncleansed and repainted. New carpets were ordered; the making of\r\na nicely upholstered throne was entrusted to Talati's, a general\r\nmerchandise house in Peking, which fact greatly amused Countess\r\nAhlefeldt.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, with foresight and astuteness, General Tsai Ao and Liang\r\nChi-chao were planning their movement against Yuan. By establishing the\r\nfirst independent government in the remote province of Yunnan they made\r\nsure that Yuan Shih-kai would be unable to vindicate his authority over\r\nall China at an early time. With Yunnan as starting point, it was hoped\r\nthat the provinces of Kweichow, Kuangsi, and Szechuan could be induced\r\nto associate themselves with the anti-monarchist movement. Though\r\nCanton had a large garrison of Yuan's troops, it was hoped that inroads\r\nwould be made even there.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Mr. Liang Chi-chao wrote a characteristic letter of\r\nresignation to the President:\r\n\r\n\"On a previous occasion, I had the honour to apply to Your Excellency\r\nfor leave to resign and in answer to my request, Your Excellency\r\ngranted me two months' sick leave. This shows the magnanimity and\r\nkindness of Your Excellency toward me.\r\n\r\n\"The recent state of my health is by no means improved. The 'pulses'\r\nin my body have become swollen and I am often attacked by fits of\r\ndizziness. My appearance looks healthy, but my energy and spirit have\r\nbecome exhausted. Different medicines have been prescribed by the\r\ndoctors, but none has proved effective. My ill-health has been chiefly\r\ncaused by my doctors' 'misuse of medicine.' I have lately been often\r\nattacked by fits of cold, which cause me sleepless nights. I am quite\r\naware of the gravity of my disease and unless I give up all worldly\r\naffairs, I am afraid that my illness will be beyond hope of cure.\r\n\r\n\"In different places in America, the climate is mild and good for\r\ninvalids. I have now made up my mind to sail for the new continent to\r\nrecuperate my health. There I shall consult the best physicians for the\r\ncare of my health. I am longing to spend a vacation in perfect ease\r\nand freedom from worldly cares in order to recuperate my health. I am\r\nsailing immediately. I hereby respectfully bring this to the notice of\r\nYour Excellency.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, proceed to America.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nDOWNFALL AND DEATH OF YUAN SHIH-KAI\r\n\r\n\r\nEverybody thought that the monarchy was to be proclaimed on New Year's\r\nDay, 1916. Disaffection, it was realized, though hitherto confined to\r\na remote province, might spread; delay was dangerous. Business in the\r\nYangtse Valley and elsewhere was dull. Merchants blamed the Central\r\nGovernment, and murmurings were heard. General Feng Kuo-chang, who had\r\nat first encouraged Yuan Shih-kai, now reserved his independence of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe revolt remained localized in Yunnan throughout January. With\r\nthe rise of an opposition, Yuan was now more ready to accentuate\r\nthe constitutional character of the new monarchy. His Minister of\r\nFinance, Mr. Chow Tsu-chi, told me that a constitutional convention\r\nwould be convoked when the monarchy was proclaimed. This would provide\r\na representative assembly and a responsible cabinet. Constructive\r\nreforms were to be announced. No further patents of nobility were to be\r\nawarded, the titles already granted would be treated as purely military\r\nhonours.\r\n\r\nIf Yuan and his advisers had acted boldly at this time in promulgating\r\nthe monarchy, recognition by a number of powers would probably\r\nhave followed, especially as the continuity of the personnel of\r\nthe Government made recognition easier. But hesitation and delay\r\nstrengthened the opposition. Yunnanese troops had by the end of January\r\npenetrated into the neighbouring provinces of Szechuan and Kuangsi. To\r\nlearn what was going on in these provinces I sent the military attaché,\r\nMajor Newell, up the Yangtse River to Szechuan, and the naval attaché,\r\nLieut.-Commander Hutchins, to Canton. Efforts of the generals loyal to\r\nYuan to expel the Yunnanese from Szechuan Province were unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nAfter the peculiarly complex manner of Chinese political relationships,\r\nYunnan began to exercise an influence in Szechuan Province which was\r\nto last for years. The Yunnanese were protected by natural barriers\r\nof mountains; to make headway against them was difficult, even had\r\nthe troops of the President shown greater energy. How hollow was\r\nthe unanimity which had been proclaimed in the November elections\r\nnow became thoroughly apparent. Encouraged by the open opposition,\r\nill-will against Yuan Shih-kai began to be shown in other localities,\r\nparticularly in Hunan and in the southernmost provinces, Kuangsi and\r\nKuangtung. Rivalries hitherto held in check by Yuan's strong hand also\r\ncame to the fore. In central China the two men holding the greatest\r\nmilitary power, Generals Feng Kuo-chang and Chang Hsun, began to\r\ncherish resentment against the President; for, in exchanging notes upon\r\nmeeting, they discovered that Yuan had set each of them to watch the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nEven now the monarchical movement might have gained strength from\r\nthe moderates, who feared the Japanese. They did not wish to see the\r\nnational unity disrupted. \"Get a constitution and a representative\r\nlegislature,\" they advised Yuan Shih-kai; \"put in play a constructive\r\nprogramme of state action; reform the finances and the audit, simplify\r\nthe taxes, extend works of public use, build roads, reclaim lands,\r\ndevelop agriculture and industry, and all might yet be well.\" Mr. Liang\r\nShih-yi and Mr. Chow Tsu-chi hoped, once the question of succession was\r\ndefinitely settled, to \"put in commission\" the dictatorial power of\r\nYuan. As Mr. Chow this time put it: \"Yuan will have the seat of honour\r\nbut others will order the meal.\"\r\n\r\nToward the end of January the formal proclamation of the empire was\r\nfurther postponed. Mr. Chow Tsu-chi was to go on a special mission to\r\nJapan, probably to induce the Japanese Government to be more favourable\r\nto the new monarchy, and to bear handsome concessions to the Japanese.\r\nBut the Japanese Government declared that for personal reasons the\r\nEmperor of Japan could not receive a Chinese embassy at that time.\r\nPossibly various other concessionaire governments intimated to Japan\r\nthat they did not expect her to entertain any special proposals at this\r\ntime. Nevertheless, the Japanese must have made strong representations\r\nto cause Yuan Shih-kai, who was a decisive and determined man, to risk\r\nall by hesitating at this critical moment.\r\n\r\nTo present some Americans I called on Yuan Shih-kai on February 16th.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Ulysses S. Grant were visiting Peking, and Yuan was\r\nglad to have me present the son of the famous American President who\r\nhad himself visited China and established cordial relations with Li\r\nHung-chang, Yuan's great master. Significantly the President said to\r\nMr. Grant: \"Your honoured father had great power, but he could safely\r\nresign it to others when the time came. You have great political\r\nexperience in the West.\" It was quite a little party, including\r\nthe newly appointed commercial attaché, Mr. Julean H. Arnold; the\r\ncommandant of the guard, Colonel Wendell C. Neville; and two young\r\nwriters, Miss Emerson and Miss Weil, who have since devoted themselves\r\nto Far Eastern studies and literary work. While the Emperor-elect\r\nbetrayed traces of strain and worry, he had his accustomed genial\r\nmanners. Apropos of the commercial attaché and the commandant he made\r\na little pleasantry about commerce and war coming hand in hand. After\r\na brief interview the visitors were taken by the master of ceremonies\r\nto see the gardens, while I remained with Yuan Shih-kai for a long\r\nconversation. This was interpreted by Doctor Tenney and by Dr. Hawkling\r\nL. Yen, of the Foreign Office; it was understood by us all that the\r\nconversation was personal and unofficial.\r\n\r\n\"I have not sought new honours and responsibilities, but now that a\r\ncourse of action has been formally decided upon, it is my duty to carry\r\nit out,\" Yuan said. \"The people coöperated in this, I desire that they\r\nshall coöperate at all times.\"\r\n\r\nI asked how soon he would announce definitely his constitutional\r\npolicy. I had some doubt as to how far he intended to apply any,\r\nand his answer was evasive. \"It is hard,\" he replied, \"to make a\r\nconstitution before the monarchy is actually reëstablished. Then,\r\ntoo, if the Emperor heads the Government, the powers of departments\r\nunder him would need to be more restricted than under a republic.\" His\r\nadvisers, it seemed, were unduly optimistic in expecting Yuan to stand\r\nsquarely for constitutional government, with power devolving on the\r\nparliament and the different departments. I reminded him of the British\r\nmonarchy in its various historic forms to refute his idea.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he responded, \"the new constitution must wait for a People's\r\nConvention. This is soon to be called; its action must not be in any\r\nway anticipated.\"\r\n\r\nHe then fell back on his record, stating that he had pressed the Manchu\r\nGovernment to adopt a constitution. He also referred to the title\r\nchosen for his reign, \"Hung Hsien,\" which means \"great constitutional\r\nera.\"\r\n\r\nA mandate of February 22nd announced the postponement of formal\r\naccession to the throne. Mr. C.C. Wu, who brought me information\r\nconcerning certain state plans of Yuan Shih-kai, said that this mandate\r\nwould put an end to the innumerable petitions sent to accelerate the\r\nformal coronation. He added that essentially the Government, so far as\r\ndomestic matters were concerned, was already a monarchy, that only in\r\nits international aspects had it failed to assume this character.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, on March 18th, the Province of Kuangsi demanded the\r\ncancellation of the monarchy; events were moving more rapidly.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture I had to decide whether to allow the Lee Higginson\r\nloan to be completed without a caution or warning, or to assume\r\nresponsibility of virtually stopping that transaction. As soon as it\r\nbecame clear that open opposition to Yuan Shih-kai's government was no\r\nlonger confined to one province and its immediate sphere of influence,\r\nit seemed no longer proper for any American institution to furnish\r\nmoney to the Chinese Government. Many appeals had been made by the\r\nOpposition based on the demand that, since the country was divided, no\r\nloans should be made to the Government. In ordinary circumstances the\r\nprotests of factions would not have weight, but when several provinces\r\nexpressed their disapproval of a basic governmental policy the case was\r\ndifferent. To have to counsel delay in execution of the loan agreement\r\nwas intensely disappointing to me, fervently as I had wished the\r\nAmerican financiers to participate in Chinese finance, in order that\r\ncredit and resources might be organized and developed for the benefit\r\nof all. Unfortunately, in the lull after the disposal of the twenty-one\r\ndemands the Chinese had immediately embarked on this doubtful political\r\nenterprise, consuming precious energies and money. The sums spent on\r\nmilitary expeditions, in favourably attuning doubtful military leaders,\r\nand in the creation of the alleged unanimous consent through a popular\r\nvote, had been thrown away. They merely added to the burdens carried by\r\nthe Chinese people.\r\n\r\nWith the disaffection of yet more provinces the Government on March\r\n22nd promulgated a decree cancelling the monarchy, and announcing that\r\nYuan Shih-kai would retain the Presidency of the Republic.\r\n\r\nThis sudden and unilateral concession, without a guaranteed _quid pro\r\nquo_ by way of submission to the Central Government by the revolting\r\nforces, came as a surprise. Doubtless the step was taken because\r\nthe President feared that the Province of Kuangtung, whose military\r\ngovernor had urged him to compromise, would join the revolutionaries.\r\nMoreover, the former Secretary of State, Hsu Shih-chang, who had been\r\nin retirement, advised it. The Anhui Party in Peking saw an opportunity\r\nto regain control and oust the Cantonese leaders, in whose hands the\r\nmonarchical movement had been since August. The President believed\r\nthat the return of such men as Hsu Shih-chang and Tuan Chi-jui would\r\nstrengthen him in the eyes of the revolutionists. Hsu Shih-chang\r\npersonally had lived up to the canons of Confucian morality in failing\r\nto approve the action of Yuan Shih-kai when he tried to assume the rank\r\nof his former master, the Emperor. This gained him universal respect\r\nin China. But his impelling motive was personal loyalty to the old\r\nImperial Family rather than attachment to its government.\r\n\r\nOf course, the cancellation of the monarchy failed to satisfy the\r\nrevolutionists. They interpreted it as a confession of weakness and\r\ndefeat. Nor was it more welcome to the adherents of the President\r\nin the provinces, especially the military, who felt that he was\r\nsurrendering without getting anything in return. Thus the President\r\nlost his friends and failed to placate his enemies. Had the southern\r\nleaders been content, the chastened Yuan might have been satisfied to\r\nbe formal head of a constitutional government. But they were not. His\r\nauthority and prestige had been too gravely compromised; revolutionists\r\nwere appearing in various parts of China; Tsingtau was being used as\r\na base for revolutionary activities in the Province of Shantung with\r\nconnivance of the Japanese authorities. The Peking Government was\r\nthrown into confusion. The official world was apprehensive as to what\r\nthe President would do, while the foreign community feared military\r\nriots.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the so-called Anhui Party had evidently expected that\r\nit would be easy to proscribe the Cantonese leaders, Liang Shih-yi,\r\nChow Tsu-chi, lately Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, and Chu\r\nChi-chien, Minister of the Interior, and have them banished or\r\nexecuted. But contrary to their expectations these men did not at\r\nthat critical time take to the woods. To the amusement of everyone,\r\nthe leaders of the other party then became frightened and began to\r\nremove their families from Peking and to plan for places of safety\r\nfor themselves. With somewhat grim humour, Minister Chu Chi-chien\r\ndeclared that as conditions in Peking were perfectly normal, and as any\r\nunwarranted show of nervousness by officials would tend unnecessarily\r\nto disturb the populace, officials would no longer be permitted to\r\nremove their families from the city.\r\n\r\nIt now became a question whether Yuan Shih-kai could remain even as\r\nPresident. I had a conversation with Mr. Hioki, the Japanese minister,\r\nwho spoke at length about the shortcomings of Yuan, and his tendency to\r\nuse all the functions of state, including particularly the financial,\r\nto satisfy his personal ambitions. Mr. Hioki did not believe that Yuan\r\nShih-kai could possibly restore his authority. The month of April was\r\na period of great depression in Peking. All constructive work, and\r\neven planning therefor, had been entirely suspended. The new ministry\r\ncame in on April 24th, under General Tuan Chi-jui as Minister of War.\r\nThis fact indicated shiftings of power, as General Tuan had never\r\nsupported the President in his imperialist ambitions. The Cantonese\r\nleaders stepped out of the Government, maintaining their influence\r\nthereafter by the familiar methods of Liang Shih-yi. Mr. Tsao Ju-lin,\r\nwho belonged to the Communications Party, but had been specializing\r\nin establishing closer relations with the Japanese, became Minister\r\nof Communications. The President agreed to turn over to the cabinet\r\nfull governmental powers, and to make the ministers responsible to the\r\nnational parliament, which was to be summoned forthwith. Yuan ceased\r\nhis personal control over all important branches of the Administration.\r\nThe control of the army was transferred from the President to the\r\nBoard of War. He was stripped of all military forces but his Honanese\r\nbodyguard, which numbered about twenty thousand.\r\n\r\nThe name of Yuan Shih-kai, however, was retained as a symbol of\r\nauthority, for all the military leaders owed him allegiance. Mr. Liang\r\nShih-yi, as president of the Bank of Communications, still controlled\r\nthe finances, and his associate, Mr. Chow Tsu-chi, was placed in charge\r\nof the Bank of China.\r\n\r\nThe Government was driven to such extremes by its financial needs that\r\nin May the cabinet declared a moratorium suspending specie payments\r\non notes of the government banks. The term \"moratorium,\" which had\r\njust then come into prominence in Europe, was greeted by the Chinese\r\nfinanciers as the password to save them--a respectable name for\r\nwhat was otherwise not so honourable. Through this step, whatever\r\nconfidence still remained in Yuan Shih-kai was dissipated. Because of\r\nthe complex nature of Chinese affairs peculiar consequences followed.\r\nThus, the postal administration offices and those of certain railways\r\nindependently announced that they would not accept notes but would\r\ndemand payment in silver.\r\n\r\nAll reports of local troubles coming from reliable sources in various\r\nparts of China spoke of the participation of Japanese in revolutionary\r\nactivities. Specific reports from Shantung indicated that the\r\nrevolutionaries there were favoured by the Japanese. At Tsingtau\r\nbandits had come over from Manchuria and were openly drilling early\r\nin May under the noses of the Japanese military. About a thousand\r\nof these rebels left Tsingtau on May 4th over the Shantung railway,\r\ncarrying machine guns to the centre of the province, where they took\r\npart in the disturbances. Meanwhile, the same railway, under Japanese\r\ncontrol, had refused to carry Chinese government troops on the ground\r\nthat neutrality must be maintained. When questioned about the rebels\r\ntransported, the railway officials stated that the rebels must have\r\nbeen in civilian clothes and must have carried their armament as\r\nbaggage.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear whether the Japanese were systematically working\r\nfor the establishment of an independent government in the south, or\r\nwhether they were merely covertly encouraging opposition to the Central\r\nGovernment, to foment division and unrest. But the plans of Japan for\r\ngaining a dominant position in China were certainly favoured by the\r\nfinal breakdown of the authority of Yuan Shih-kai.\r\n\r\nJapanese correspondents at this time started the report that Chinese\r\nmerchants in the Yangtse Valley were so provoked with Americans for\r\nmaking a loan to the Chinese Government--the Lee Higginson loan--that\r\nthey were planning a boycott against American goods. The Japanese\r\npaper, _Shun Tim Shih Pao_, incidentally drew on its imagination, and\r\npublished a yarn to the effect that in addition to the $5,000,000 loan\r\nalready agreed to, the American firm had promised to hand over to the\r\nPeking authorities $15,000,000 before the end of July. As a matter\r\nof fact, beyond the original payment of $1,000,000, nothing was ever\r\npaid over. The Chinese did not take up the suggestion of a boycott;\r\nalthough, had the making of the loan proceeded, such a result might\r\nhave followed. In Peking, on the other hand, the Japanese tried to\r\nimpress upon Chinese officials that the non-completion of the Lee\r\nHigginson loan offered new proof that Americans could not be relied\r\nupon when it came to a showdown.\r\n\r\nThroughout this difficult period the European Allied Powers felt that\r\nthey lacked a free hand, and that any joint action undertaken might\r\neasily assume such form as to create a Japanese hegemony. The Japanese\r\nat all times urged that as they were on the spot it would be only\r\nnatural to entrust them with the representation of the interests of the\r\nAllies. Many representative Europeans in China plainly intimated to us\r\nthe hope that the American Government might show a strong interest in\r\nChinese affairs, and might not fail to insist on the maintenance of\r\nexisting treaty rights and of Chinese sovereignty.\r\n\r\nI knew from the Chinese who saw him daily that Yuan Shih-kai suffered\r\nunder the strain of his troubles and disappointment. As early as March\r\nMr. Liang Tun-yen besought me to visit the President and give him\r\nencouragement, as worry and despair were breaking him down. Yuan had\r\nlived a sedentary life of intense work and great responsibility. He\r\nhad developed Bright's disease, but his strong constitution had fought\r\nit off. Now when great trouble beset him his strength failed. Mr. Chow\r\nTzu-chi remarked to me: \"The President's power of quick decision has\r\nleft him; he is helpless in the troublesome alternatives that confront\r\nhim. Formerly it was 'yes' or 'no' in an instant, to my proposals. Now\r\nhe ruminates, and wavers, and changes a decision many times.\" Yuan\r\ncontemplated resignation, and seemed taken with the idea of visiting\r\nAmerica. I was sounded as to giving him safe conduct and asylum. The\r\nOpposition, it seemed, would make no objection to his leaving the\r\ncountry. He was confined to his room during the latter half of May, but\r\ncontinued to give his personal attention to telegrams and important\r\ncorrespondence. In the first days of June his health seemed to improve.\r\nI went with my family to Peitaiho to instal them in their summer\r\nresidence, and to rest for a few days. I had left a special code with\r\nMr. MacMurray, in which the word _Pan_ stood for Yuan Shih-kai. I was\r\nshocked on the afternoon of June 6th to receive the brief telegram:\r\n\"Pan is dead.\"\r\n\r\nBy the night train I returned to the capital. Yuan's sons, the\r\nex-Premier Hsu Shih-chang, and several officials close to the\r\nPresident, were with him when he died. During the night he had made\r\nsolemn declaration to the ex-Premier that it had not been his wish\r\nto become Emperor; he had been deceived into believing that the step\r\nwas demanded by the public, and was necessary to the country. After\r\nsaying this he seemed exhausted, and continued to sink until the end\r\ncame. He had weakened himself and further aggravated his illness by\r\nindiscriminately taking medicine prescribed by a foreign physician\r\ntogether with all sorts of Chinese remedies which his women urged upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe ministers of the Allied Powers at once called on General Tuan to\r\ninquire whether the Government was prepared to prevent disorders. Some\r\ntime previously the Japanese minister had asked me whether I would\r\nconsider it suitable for the diplomatic corps, in the event of danger\r\nof disturbances, to make such an inquiry. I felt it unnecessary and\r\nundesirable, as it might cause apprehension among the public.\r\n\r\nThe German and Austrian commandants were included in the conference to\r\nagree on measures of protection--probably the only instance during the\r\nwar where the belligerents of both sides met to consider common action.\r\nSubsequently the Belgian minister requested the American Legation to\r\ntake over the patrol of the city wall immediately back of the Belgian\r\nLegation, which had thus far had German sentinels. It illustrates the\r\ncomplexity of all things in China that, as late as 1916, German troops\r\nwere concerned in the formal protection of the Belgian Legation.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai before his death wrote a declaration to the effect\r\nthat in the event of his disability the Presidency should devolve on\r\nGeneral Li Yuan-hung. The accession of the Vice-President was announced\r\nimmediately. The members of the cabinet, as well as Prince Pu-Lun, as\r\nchairman of the State Council, waited on President Li on the 7th of\r\nJune; with a simple ceremonial, including three deferential bows, the\r\ncabinet expressed its allegiance to the new President. He was accepted\r\npeaceably and with unanimity by all the provinces.\r\n\r\nGeneral Tuan Chi-jui and Mr. Liang Shih-yi coöperated in arranging\r\nfor the transfer of authority to the new President. That this was done\r\nso quietly and in so orderly a fashion caused the foreigners to regard\r\nChinese republicanism with much higher respect.\r\n\r\nThe body of Yuan was not transferred from Peking to his Honan home\r\nuntil June 28th, when the mausoleum on the ancestral estate was ready.\r\nAs part of the Imperial movement, Yuan Shih-kai had previously begun\r\nthe construction of this large tomb. The commemorative ceremony took\r\nplace on the 26th in Peking. The great hall of the Presidential palace,\r\nwhere we had often witnessed New Year receptions and other festivities,\r\nwas used. There were gathered the foreign representatives with their\r\nstaffs and the high officials of the Chinese Republic. It was a strange\r\nmingling of old and new. The President's body lay on a high catafalque,\r\nin the very place where he had so often received us. In front of the\r\nentrance to the inner apartments stood rows of tables bearing the usual\r\nfuneral offerings as well as the weapons, clothes, and other objects of\r\npersonal use of the departed. Here were gorgeous Mandarin coats of the\r\nold régime, including the famous Yellow Jacket, and generals' uniforms\r\nof the new, and innumerable decorations sent by all the countries\r\nbestowing such honours; also tall riding boots, soft Chinese slippers,\r\nlong native pipes and foreign smoking sets, swords, and pistols.\r\n\r\nThe service was a litany conducted by Lama priests from temples\r\nin Peking and Mongolia. Some of the priests wore a huge headdress\r\nresembling a dragoon's helmet; others, a large round hat not unlike\r\nthat of a cardinal. As they intoned the ritual their deep voices rolled\r\nas if they issued from an underground cavern. The music accompanying\r\nthe singing was Chinese, supplied by flutes and stringed instruments;\r\nbut at the beginning the President's band had played a Western funeral\r\nmarch. The second part of the service consisted of the burning of\r\nincense in memory of the departed. First, the sons of Yuan, wearing\r\nthe white garments of mourners, came forth from an inner apartment and\r\ntook their station before the catafalque. They prostrated themselves,\r\nstruck their foreheads heavily against the floor, and wailed with loud\r\nvoices. Yuan Ko-ting, as chief mourner, offered sacrifice. Meanwhile,\r\nthe women of the Presidential household peered through the windows of\r\nthe apartments which opened into the central hall.\r\n\r\nWhen the sons of Yuan had withdrawn, the singing of the priests was\r\ntaken up again, now in a different key and accompanied by the tinkling\r\nof many bells clear as silver, but some of them as deep as the sea.\r\nBuddhist prayers were intoned in voices sonorous and deep as the grave.\r\nThe new President next offered sacrifice at the bier of his predecessor.\r\n\r\nWhat contrasts of character and aims, what mingling of old and new\r\nforces, what a rush of incongruous ideas and practices were typified in\r\nthis ceremony, with all its accompaniments! And these were embodied,\r\ntoo, in the personality of the dead leader and in his successor!\r\n\r\nThe foreign representatives next paid their respect to the memory of\r\nYuan. We rose and each in turn deposited before the catafalque a huge\r\nwreath, and returned after making the customary three bows of high\r\nceremony. Following the diplomats came the Secretary of State and high\r\nChinese officials, as well as the foreign advisers.\r\n\r\nThe procession to the railway station, on June 28th, testified to\r\nthe genius of the Chinese for pageantry. They had preserved some of\r\nthe colour and brilliance of an Imperial procession, and what was\r\nremarkable, had so arranged the parade that the modern elements--troops\r\nin modern uniform, brass bands, officials in evening dress, and\r\ndiplomats in their varied uniforms--myself alone wearing ordinary\r\ncivilian dress--did not impart to the pageant a jarring note. In fact,\r\nthroughout the ceremony at the palace and the subsequent procession,\r\nthere was a gratifying absence of dissonance, notwithstanding the\r\nmultifariousness of the elements included.\r\n\r\nThe huge catafalque upon which the body of Yuan lay was borne by a\r\nhundred men by means of a complicated arrangement of poles. It was\r\ncovered with crimson silk embroidered in gold; its imperial splendour\r\naccentuated the tragedy of the occasion. Old Chinese funeral customs,\r\nsuch as the throwing into the air of paper resembling money, were\r\nobserved. Heading the procession rode twenty heralds, then followed\r\nin succession three large detachments of infantry, bearing their arms\r\nreversed. Between each two detachments marched a band. After the\r\ninfantry came Chinese musicians, playing weirdly plaintive strains\r\non their flutes. Then came the beautiful and fascinating part of the\r\ncortège--a large squadron of riders in old Chinese costume, carrying\r\nhuge banners, long triangular pennants, and fretted streamers of many\r\ncolours, which, as they floated gracefully in the air, made a charming\r\npicture. The Chinese have a genius for using banners with dazzling\r\neffect. Then followed lancers escorting an empty state carriage;\r\nBuddhist monks beating drums and cymbals; the President's band; long\r\nlines of bearers with sacrificial vessels preceding the sedan chair\r\nin which was set the soul tablet of Yuan; then still other lines of\r\nmen bearing the food offerings, the mementoes of Yuan's personal life,\r\nand the wreaths, all from the funeral ceremony of two days before.\r\nHigh officials came next, on foot, in military uniform or civilian\r\nfull dress, and here indeed the frock coats and top hats did seem\r\nsomewhat out of keeping. A throng of white-clad mourners preceded the\r\ncatafalque; the sons of Yuan walked under a white canopy. Yuan Ko-ting\r\nin the midst of it all seemed a pathetic figure.\r\n\r\nThe vast throngs that lined the route behind lines of troops looked\r\non in respectful silence. There was no sign of grief, rather mute\r\nindifference. Yuan had not won the heart of the people, who regarded\r\nhim as a masterful individual dwelling in remote seclusion whose\r\ncontact with them came through taxes and executions. I believe a\r\nChinese crowd is incapable of the enthusiastic hero-worship which great\r\npolitical leaders in the Occident receive. The people have not yet come\r\nto look upon such men as their leaders. The Peking population, imbued\r\nstill with traditions of imperial splendour and the remoteness and\r\nsemi-divinity of their rulers, are as yet only onlookers at the pageant\r\nof history.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of the great man who had died as a consequence of his\r\nambition made this occasion impressive to the foreigners present,\r\neven to the most cynical. It was the last act in one of the most\r\nstriking dramas of intrigue, achievement, and defeat. The foreign\r\nrepresentatives left the cortège before it issued from the southernmost\r\ngate of the Imperial City, stopping while the mourners and the\r\ncatafalque moved past. A piece of paper money thrown into the air\r\nto pacify the spirits fell on me, and I kept it as a characteristic\r\nmemento. I walked back to the Legation Quarter with the Russian\r\nminister, Prince Koudacheff, who, like myself, was deeply impressed; we\r\nagreed that in ceremony and pageantry the Chinese stand supreme.\r\n\r\nThus, with the fluttering of bright banners and the wailing of the reed\r\nflutes, another crowded chapter in the history of the new China drew to\r\nits close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nREPUBLICANS IN THE SADDLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passing of Yuan Shih-kai left the ground clear for the nurturing of\r\na real republic in China. Would those in control be real republicans,\r\nor would they be merely politicians? Politics, with all that this term\r\nimplies in modern times, was exotic, its importation into China might\r\nhave disastrous results. Concentration on industry, on local government\r\nby the Chinese people, and the building up from these of a sound\r\nand democratic national consciousness were needed. It was upon this\r\nfoundation that Li Yuan-hung might have founded his rule.\r\n\r\nHis first reception to foreign ministers was given by President Li\r\nYuan-hung shortly after the funeral of Yuan Shih-kai. Li had removed\r\nfrom the island in the Imperial City before the death of Yuan; and this\r\nwas a step toward freedom, though he had continued to be surrounded\r\nwith guards ostensibly for his protection, but really there to watch\r\nhim and restrict his movements. His friends were still apprehensive\r\nfor his safety, and I was repeatedly approached with inquiries as to\r\nwhether in case of need I should receive him at the American Legation,\r\nor possibly, even, send a guard detachment to bring him in. The latter\r\nI could not do; but, while it is not proper to give specific assurances\r\nof protection in advance, I could say that it was customary to grant\r\nasylum to political refugees. I learned that some Americans were ready\r\nto try a rescue of the Vice-President should his situation become\r\nperilous. Upon the death of Yuan Shih-kai, General Li's situation of\r\nuncertainty and danger was ended at least for a while.\r\n\r\nHe received the diplomats in a private residence, whence he did not\r\nremove to the palace for several months. The ceremony was simple.\r\nThe foreign representatives were introduced in three groups: Allies,\r\nNeutrals, and Central Powers. The President received us standing,\r\nattended by his ministers and twelve generals, all in uniform.\r\nGeneral Tuan Chi-jui looked disconsolate, standing with bent head and\r\nwith epaulets sloping down on his chest. I do not know whether his\r\nspirit was as sad as his outward demeanour, but he probably saw many\r\ndifficulties ahead. The President made a few remarks of a friendly\r\nnature, but throughout he looked far more serious than was his wont;\r\nand his face was not wreathed in smiles.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the day of Yuan's funeral I visited the new\r\nPresident informally; passing through several interior courts where\r\nsoldiers were on guard and through a smiling flower garden I came\r\ninto the library, simply furnished, where the President was working.\r\nPiles of papers and books on the desk and side tables indicated that\r\nhe had been seeking information from many sources. We spent an hour\r\nor so discussing the political situation. He felt relieved at being\r\nno longer guarded and confined; but his newly acquired state had not\r\nchanged his simplicity of manner. Quite in his usual optimistic mood,\r\nhe said: \"I have found a way to secure the coöperation of all factions.\r\nI will declare the Provisional Constitution of 1912 to be in force, and\r\nsummon the old parliament; but its membership should be reduced by one\r\nhalf; it is too unwieldy. It will be summoned for this purpose only and\r\nto finish the Constitution; the reduction will come by amending the\r\nparliamentary election law.\"\r\n\r\nI asked the President whether he did not consider it impossible thus to\r\nlimit the function of the parliament, when once it was summoned. Would\r\nit not, I asked, almost certainly try to assume a controlling power in\r\nthe Government, and would not this, in the absence of mature leaders,\r\ncause confusion?\r\n\r\n\"No,\" the President insisted; \"the parliament will be confined to the\r\nspecific function indicated by me.\"\r\n\r\nAs the community of Americans at Shanghai had repeatedly invited\r\nme to come to that city, I carried out a long-delayed intention by\r\njourneying southward to celebrate the Fourth of July there. My chief\r\nengagement--following, among others, an address at the Commencement\r\nexercises at St. John's University, an American University Club lunch,\r\na reception given in my honour on the Flagship _Brooklyn_--was an\r\naddress before the American Chamber of Commerce at dinner in the Palace\r\nHotel, on July 1st. I spoke about the requirements of the new period\r\nupon which American commercial interests in the Far East were entering.\r\nIn European countries and Japan, I said, the relation between the\r\nGovernment and the large industries and banking institutions is close.\r\nTogether they develop national enterprise abroad. Not so in America.\r\nThe Government and the concentrated capital of the United States do\r\nnot act as a unit in foreign affairs. We believe that it is better to\r\nleave the initiative to private enterprise, confining the action of the\r\nGovernment to protecting opportunities for commerce abroad. In their\r\nwork of organization, American merchants and representatives have the\r\nfunction of discovering, testing, and approving commercial policies and\r\nprojects which are to be executed with home capital. On their wisdom\r\nand experience in China, New York and Chicago have to rely.\r\n\r\nAt the reception given by the Consul-General in Shanghai on the Fourth\r\nof July, I met Mr. Tang Shao-yi, the Kuo Min Tang leader who had\r\nbeen Premier and Minister of Finance in the first cabinet under the\r\nRepublic. I found him unprepared to assume any responsible part in\r\npolitics, although the prominence of his opposition to Yuan Shih-kai\r\nmight have made him ready to help. As President Li had urged him to\r\ncome to Peking, Mr. Tang said he would go when parliament had been\r\nreconvoked. But I apprehended and understood from others that he was\r\nloth to go because his enemies in Peking were still too powerful.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief vacation at the summer residence of my family at\r\nPeitaiho, whither I had proceeded on the U.S. ship _Cincinnati_, I\r\nreturned to Peking on the 27th of July, as much business awaited me\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nA change of government took place. The appointment of a new cabinet\r\nwas announced on June 30, 1916, with a personnel completely different\r\nfrom that under Yuan Shih-kai. Mr. Tang did not leave Shanghai. A\r\nprovisional cabinet was therefore constituted under General Tuan\r\nChi-jui, Dr. Chen Chin-tao acting as Minister of Finance and Mr. Hsu\r\nShih-ying as Minister of Communications. I had long known Doctor\r\nChen, who had received his education in the United States and had\r\nlived abroad many years as Financial Commissioner of the Chinese\r\nGovernment. He was one of the few men in Chinese official life familiar\r\nwith Western finance and banking--a scholarly man, slow and somewhat\r\nheavy in speech and manner, studious, and desirous of carrying modern\r\nmethods of efficiency and careful audit into all branches of the\r\nAdministration. Everyone met him with confidence.\r\n\r\nThe southern leaders did not come to Peking because they wished\r\ntheir complete ascendency to be recognized before taking part in the\r\nGovernment. Their demands that the Constitution of 1912 be revived\r\nand that Parliament be restored had been complied with. They further\r\ninsisted on punishment for the leaders of the monarchical movement.\r\nAccordingly, on July 13th a mandate was issued providing for the\r\narrest and trial of eight public men, including Liang Shih-yi, Chu\r\nChi-chien, and Chow Tsu-chi. All of these men happened to be beyond\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Chinese Government, so the mandate had the\r\neffect only of a decree of exile. General Tuan, the Premier, smilingly\r\nremarked in cabinet meeting that if the monarchists were really to be\r\npunished, few men in public life would go free.\r\n\r\nWith an entirely new personnel of government, all threads of\r\nnegotiations, past and present, had to be taken up anew. I was already\r\nacquainted with the Premier and with Doctor Chen, but the other cabinet\r\nmembers I had met casually or not at all. With Doctor Chen and his\r\nassociate of the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Hsu Un-yuen, who had been\r\nappointed managing director of the Bank of China, and with General Hsu\r\nShu-cheng, the Premier's chief assistant, I frequently talked over\r\nthe financial situation of China. The monarchical movement had been\r\ndefeated, the Republic more firmly established; now, they suggested, it\r\nwas highly appropriate for America to support China financially. They\r\nrequested that the loan contract made by Lee, Higginson & Company be\r\ncarried out, and further steps taken for strengthening and organizing\r\nChinese credit.\r\n\r\nI told the Premier about the railway and canal negotiations. He wished\r\nto encourage American participation in Chinese development, but did not\r\ncommit himself on the new American proposals. On the matter of a loan\r\nhe reënforced the position taken by the Minister of Finance and General\r\nHsu. General Tuan had won the confidence of the Chinese people through\r\nhis disapproval of Yuan's monarchical ambitions, and now occupied a\r\nstrong position. \"I do not expect much good,\" he said, \"from the return\r\nof parliament; there will be endless party struggles and interference\r\nwith the Administration. But as to this curious modern method of\r\ngoverning through talk, which fundamentally I see no virtue in, I am\r\nwilling to give it a fair trial.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I called on the Minister of Communications, I took care that the\r\nconversation should be, not on business, but on literature and the\r\nsurroundings of Peking. He liked calligraphy; also, he had written\r\nshort literary pieces, one of which was a poetical description of the\r\nSummer Palace. After a pleasant hour with tea the minister escorted me\r\nnot only through all the various gates of the inner courts, but to the\r\nvery door of my carriage. One of my colleagues on his initial visit\r\nto the minister had a less fortunate experience. The interview, which\r\nconcerned a certain action long delayed, was somewhat spirited, for the\r\ndiplomat insisted with great emphasis that something be done forthwith.\r\nBy contrast the minister made me specially welcome, pleased that I\r\ndid not immediately descend upon him with demands. When, thereafter,\r\nmatters of business had to be taken up, there was the same cordiality,\r\neven when difficult things were discussed.\r\n\r\nDuring the first month of its renewed life, beginning the 1st of\r\nAugust, the parliament did nothing to justify the unfavourable\r\nexpectations of its critics. It was not rash or irresponsible, its\r\nmembers subordinated their private and partisan views to the urgent\r\nneeds of national unity and coöperation. The military party pursued\r\na waiting policy, seeming ready to give parliament a chance to show\r\nwhat it could do. Meanwhile, the financial situation of the Government\r\nbecame difficult, as the provinces had not yet been prevailed upon to\r\ngive adequate support.\r\n\r\nAmong the newly arrived leaders of the democratic party whose abilities\r\nand character I was appraising was Mr. Sun Hung-yi, the Minister of the\r\nInterior. I went to him, passing through narrow and crooked streets to\r\nhis house in a remote part of the city. It was surrounded by military\r\nguards, carriages, and automobiles. The courts swarmed with people;\r\nsoldiers were lounging about, while countless long-coated individuals\r\nhurried to and fro or sat in conversation in the rooms or on porches.\r\nMr. Sun, who met me in an interior apartment, was tall, broad faced,\r\nwith sparse whiskers and hair standing up rebelliously in wisps. He\r\nwore a long brown coat, bestowing little care on his appearance.\r\n\"The parliament,\" he said, \"cannot confine itself to its principal\r\ntask, the finishing of the Constitution; it must also control public\r\nadministration.\"\r\n\r\nA contest for power was inevitable, it seemed, between the Premier and\r\nthe parliament.\r\n\r\nMr. Sun was a typical politician. Here he was, his innumerable\r\nretainers about him, all intent on the game, while he was cunningly\r\ndeploying his forces for tactical advantage in politics. He betrayed no\r\nideas of statesmanship, only a desire for party dominance; though later\r\nhe did show signs of developing a broader vision.\r\n\r\nI also met Mr. Ku Chung-hsiu, the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce,\r\na most complacent and oily person, who would be recognized the world\r\nover as the suave political manipulator.\r\n\r\nOf such calibre, then, were the men who, under President Li Yuan-hung,\r\nwere to lay the foundations of the new government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nTHE WAR AND CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nAMERICAN ENTREPRENEURS IN PEKING\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the second year of the Hwai River conservancy option was about to\r\nexpire, something positive had to be done in order to make an actual\r\nbeginning on this work. Mr. W.F. Carey, whose various enterprises have\r\nalready been referred to, had arrived in Peking in December, 1915, with\r\nhis family and a large staff. He brought over his whole organization,\r\nfor his firm's arrangements with the New York capitalists made him\r\nfeel ready, not only to negotiate, but to start work. He had completed\r\nextensive railway construction work in Canada and the United States;\r\nhis organization was ready for China. He was a man accustomed to\r\nattacking his work with full force and getting it out of the way. He\r\nknew there was plenty of work to do in China, and he was ready to start\r\ndoing it without delay.\r\n\r\nTested and highly recommended as the conservancy undertaking had been\r\nby the engineering commission under Colonel Sibert, the financiers\r\nassociated with the Siems-Carey Company yet hesitated. It was then\r\nsuggested that they do part of the work and reserve an option on the\r\nentire enterprise. The negotiations with Mr. Chow Tsu-chi, Minister of\r\nFinance, developed that the only part which might be dissociated from\r\nthe whole was the restoration of the Grand Canal. But it would hardly\r\nbe profitable to undertake this unless at least the whole portion from\r\nthe Yangtse River to Techow were to be made navigable. Enough traffic\r\nmight then be counted upon to afford by means of tolls security for\r\nthe loan, together with certain tracts of land which would be drained.\r\nA period of four months was given to investigate the feasibility and\r\ncost of this work, while the option on the more extensive enterprise of\r\nthe Hwai River conservancy was extended.\r\n\r\nThe men representing American firms who came with Mr. Carey created\r\nin Peking the impression of an onslaught of American enterprise. The\r\nInternational Banking Corporation and the American International\r\nCorporation had sent a new representative. The firm of Anderson, Meyer\r\n& Company, hitherto Danish, had been acquired by American capital, and\r\na representative had been sent to Peking. Social life in the American\r\ncolony was visibly enlivened by this influx. It was amusing to see\r\nhow large groups of people from St. Paul, Kansas City, Chicago, and\r\nvarious Eastern towns, suddenly planted in these entirely foreign\r\nsurroundings, could in an incredibly short time make themselves\r\nthoroughly comfortable, and establish intimate relations with their\r\nnew neighbours. The various American representatives took large houses\r\nin the city outside of the Legation Quarter, where they entertained a\r\ngreat deal.\r\n\r\nBut by the legal talent mustered for the negotiations the Chinese were\r\nrather taken aback. Not much given to legal refinements, nor to setting\r\ndown in the written contract detailed provisions for every imaginable\r\ncontingency, the meticulous care of the American legal draughtsmen\r\nimpressed the Chinese as savouring of suspicion.\r\n\r\nTheir own business arrangements are more simple and general, with\r\nreliance on a mutual sense of equity; moreover, all contracts with\r\nforeigners had hitherto been made in a less technical manner. An\r\nAmerican lawyer would not be satisfied with this. He would think of\r\nthe other corporation lawyers at home, sitting in their offices on\r\nthe thirty-fifth floor, to whom the ordinary Chinese way of drawing\r\nup contracts would seem criminally lax. To overcome the concealed\r\nresentment of the Chinese took time, together with much talk about\r\nhow the common interest would be promoted by completely defining all\r\nresponsibilities assumed. The argument which really impressed them was\r\nthat other foreign nations had frequently interpreted simply drawn\r\ncontracts entirely to the disadvantage of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nMr. Carey, also, did not personally believe in much legal refinement,\r\nbut bowed to the mature judgment of the profession. He had won his way\r\nfrom the ranks, and his Irish originality had not been befogged with\r\ntheoretical discussion. He immediately felt at home with the frank and\r\nhuman Chinese, and constantly had many of them at his house, where they\r\npartook of true American hospitality and shared in frolics of dancing\r\nand poker. The Chinese are fond of this American game, in which human\r\nnature plays so large a part; the impassiveness of their countenance\r\nlends itself admirably to the tactics of poker. It was amusing to hear\r\nLiang Shih-yi, who otherwise spoke not a word of English, enunciate\r\nfrom behind a pile of chips, in staccato tones: \"Full house,\"--\"Two\r\npair.\" This eminent financier was a worthy match for any poker expert.\r\n\r\nMr. Carey brought his unwarped intelligence to bear with great\r\nfreshness on Chinese affairs, which he discussed in the language\r\nof an American contractor and business man who reduced everything\r\nto terms of getting something done. To observe how a man of his\r\ntraining, instincts, and tradition, so utterly different from the\r\nChinese, remained in constant, intimate intercourse and joyous mutual\r\nunderstanding with them, made one believe that there must be real bonds\r\nof sympathy between Americans and the Chinese. Mr. Carey abbreviated\r\nmany of the Chinese names, thus making them far more pronounceable. Mr.\r\nChen Pan-ping, the Minister of Agriculture, thus became Ping-pong; the\r\nSecretary of State, Hsu Shih-chang, was Susie.\r\n\r\nWhen the preliminary contract for the Grand Canal had been signed, Mr.\r\nCarey and all his associates departed for Shantung and Kiangsu under\r\nthe guidance of Mr. Pan Fu, a young capitalist and official from\r\nShantung Province, who was anxious to have the constructive work begun\r\nearly.\r\n\r\nA mistake made by Americans in other parts of the world was not avoided\r\nin China. Several of the new organizations that came in at this time\r\nand during the war made their entry with a considerable blare of\r\ntrumpets and pounding of gongs, announcing the millions that were\r\nbacking them and describing the manner in which they would rip things\r\nup generally when they got started. As a great part of international\r\nbusiness is diplomacy, such methods of blatant advertisement are not\r\nbest calculated to facilitate the early operations of a new enterprise.\r\nThey raise expectations of \"easy money\" in the people dealt with,\r\nand they engender cynicism and rock-ribbed opposition on the part of\r\ncompetitors. Great enterprises in foreign trade are usually built up\r\nwith quieter methods. My observations on this score by no means refer\r\nto all new American enterprise in China, but there was enough of\r\nthis sort of brass-band work to give people an idea that it was the\r\napproved method of American entry into foreign markets. The subsequent\r\nflattening out of several of these loudly heralded ventures did not\r\nhelp matters.\r\n\r\nI had on February 29th a long interview with Dr. Jeme Tien-yow, an\r\nAmerican-educated engineer, who had won repute through the survey\r\nand construction of the Peking-Kalgan Railway, of which he was chief\r\nengineer. He was looked upon as a living example of what the Chinese\r\ncould do for themselves in engineering. At this time he was managing\r\ndirector of the Hukuang railways. I had had extensive correspondence\r\nwith him, directly and through the Consul-General at Hankow with\r\nrespect to the engineering standards to be applied on his lines, as it\r\nwas difficult to find a middle ground between the American and British\r\nmanufacturers and those of other nations concerned. Doctor Jeme was\r\non the whole favourable to America, but clung to European standards,\r\nmuch to the disadvantage of American equipment. We went over all the\r\ndisputed points with regard to solid cast wheels or tread wheels,\r\nshapes of box cars, types of engines, and so on--a curiously technical\r\nconversation for a foreign minister to hold with a railway director as\r\na matter of official business. Doctor Jeme was slow, undemonstrative,\r\nquite willing to discuss, but not ready to yield any point in which\r\nhe thoroughly believed. The argument cleared up some matters and left\r\nothers the subject of continued correspondence.\r\n\r\nI was trying to induce the American group to take the lead in\r\nfurnishing funds so that the building of the Szechuan line of\r\nthe Hukuang railways could be undertaken. I also hoped that,\r\nnotwithstanding the war, the British and French groups might continue\r\nto furnish enough funds to complete the line from Hankow to Canton.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the greatest national need of China was the completion of\r\nthese trunk lines, both to connect the north and south of the country,\r\nand to open a land route to Szechuan Province, which could then be\r\nreached only by boat on the Yangtse, subject to all contingencies of\r\nan uncertain and dangerous navigation. It should not have required\r\nargument to induce the capitalists to advance money for a short\r\nrailway which would open an inland empire of forty millions of people,\r\nespecially when they had already bound themselves by contract to\r\nfurnish the funds.\r\n\r\nThe $30,000,000 originally advanced had been spent, without more than\r\ntwo hundred miles of actual construction to show for the vast sum. This\r\nwas due partly to the need of buying out earlier Chinese companies\r\nat extravagant figures, but also in large part to the cumbersome and\r\nexpensive organization of this international enterprise. Only by\r\nactually finishing one of these basically important lines and putting\r\nit in operation could the money already expended be made to count.\r\n\r\nAt home the group seemed favourable to going ahead to the completion\r\nof the work. Mr. Willard Straight in February went to London to seek\r\nthe consent of the British and French partners. But beyond settling\r\nsome minor details about alignments no definite result was secured.\r\nChinese development was blocked disastrously through this failure to\r\ncomplete the existing contracts. In comparison with the amounts spent\r\nin Europe by America, the cost of entirely carrying out this enormously\r\nimportant work would have been infinitesimal; a thousandth part of our\r\nwar expense would have permanently changed the face of China.\r\n\r\nIndeed, completion of such an enterprise would far transcend\r\nmere business. What the Chinese needed was the organization of\r\ntheir national life. In every particular this depended upon\r\ncommunications--trunk lines north and south, east and west--which would\r\nhave largely overcome obstacles to Chinese progress. The nation's mind,\r\ninstead of being focussed on building up, unifying, and organizing the\r\ndifferent parts of the country, remained localized and scattered. A\r\nthousand times the energy needed to achieve this unique work was spent\r\nby us in Europe. That is part of the cost of war.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Denby, interested in automobile manufacture, called one\r\nmorning and asked that I take a motor ride up the Tartar City Wall--a\r\nthing which had never before been attempted. I yielded to the idea, and\r\nwithout further inquiry joined him, together with the commandant of\r\nthe guard, Colonel W.C. Neville. Leaving the rear gate of the Legation\r\nand approaching the broad ramp leading up to the wall, I was surprised\r\nto see gathered there all the American marines, as well as many other\r\npeople, including motion-picture men. I had not counted on this\r\npublicity; it was, however, too late to have any regrets, so we were\r\nwhisked up the steep incline and took a ride on the top of the great\r\nwall. This first automobile ascension of the monumental structure\r\nexcited a good deal of attention. A British paper tried to raise a\r\nlaugh by ironically criticizing the British minister for not supporting\r\nBritish industry by taking air flights, or doing other things which\r\nmight serve to attract attention to national products. I did not mind\r\nwhat was said, as I had enjoyed the excitement of the ride.\r\n\r\nMr. Carey's party had by this time finished its survey. Laborious\r\nnegotiations had gone on for an acceptable contract to improve the\r\nancient Grand Canal. Mr. Carey also sought a contract for the building\r\nof railways. These matters were entrusted to Mr. Roy S. Anderson,\r\nwho carried on the detailed negotiations. I had given Mr. Carey an\r\nintroduction to the various officials concerned, and had from time\r\nto time supported his efforts, but did not take part in the details.\r\nThe business was carried on with Mr. Tsao Ju-lin, the Minister of\r\nCommunications, while the canal matter lay with Mr. Chen Pan-ping,\r\nMinister of Agriculture and Commerce, a younger man, educated in Japan\r\nand a member of the Christian Church. Mr. Chow Tsu-chi, the Minister\r\nof Finance, and Mr. Liang Shih-yi, wielded a directing influence in\r\nthe negotiations. I was careful to abstain from anything which could\r\npossibly savour of pressure, or a desire to take advantage of the\r\ndifficult financial necessities of the Government. The contracts were\r\nmade not on the basis of any temporary or local interest, but to\r\nfurnish a foundation for long-continued constructive work.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government gave to the American concern the right to build\r\nfifteen hundred miles of railway, to be selected from five alignments\r\nmentioned in the contract. Mr. Carey started for America on May 18th,\r\nto secure ratification of the agreements. With him he took the most\r\nfavourable concessions which the Chinese Government had ever granted to\r\nforeigners. All the most advantageous provisions of former contracts\r\nhad been embodied; the American contractors were to get a commission of\r\n10 per cent. on the cost of construction and equipment, and were to\r\nshare, also, in the profits of operation. A broad policy of development\r\nwas adopted, embracing the encouragement of industries along the\r\nrailways to be built.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government, accustomed to financial support from nations\r\nwhich had valuable concessions, hoped that the Americans would now\r\noffer such assistance. The concessions were in no sense made dependent\r\nupon loans, but collateral loan negotiations were proceeding, and Mr.\r\nCarey took with him proposals concerning loans and securities offered.\r\nHis associates made every effort to secure a loan to China, but as\r\nthey now turned over their holdings to the American International\r\nCorporation, and as the latter was negotiating to take over the\r\nAmerican group agreements with Great Britain, Russia, France, and\r\nJapan, the matter became hopelessly tangled up with international\r\naffairs and no action resulted. The Americans understood that Japan\r\nwould coöperate in a joint loan but would oppose any separate action\r\nby the United States. American finance was still too provincial to\r\nact independently in such a matter. Also it would approach each piece\r\nof business as a separate unit, not ready to exert itself in behalf\r\nof a loan in order to create a more favourable situation for other\r\ntransactions. European and Japanese combinations in China took a\r\ndifferent view; they were organized to represent a broad national\r\ninterest in Chinese business. While the attitude of individual American\r\ncorporations corresponded to the individualism of our business, yet the\r\nnational commercial interest of America was bound to suffer because\r\nan organization did not exist which was broadly representative, which\r\nwould look upon all parts of Chinese commerce and finance in their\r\ninterrelation, and gather from every individual exertion favourable\r\ncumulative effects in other fields of enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn yet another respect American practice was unsuited to the conditions\r\nof business in China. After negotiating in a painstaking manner for\r\nmonths, the corporation's representatives had finally signed a formal\r\nagreement that was more advantageous than any ever granted before. The\r\nresults of this successful negotiation were set before the home office,\r\nwhich took the position that its hands were still completely free. The\r\nprovisions of the contract were minutely reëxamined; on several points\r\nit was concluded that still more favourable arrangements might be made.\r\nThe representatives were instructed to reopen the negotiations, making\r\nthe consent of the home corporation dependent on the acceptance of\r\nthese additional terms.\r\n\r\nSuch a method could not be used in China more than once. The\r\nChinese expect that when an agreement is arrived at with business\r\nrepresentatives in Peking, it will be adhered to, unless very radical\r\nchanges of conditions occur. They have been dealing on this basis with\r\nthe agents of European corporations, whose experience is considered\r\nby their home offices as entitling them to handle the details of the\r\nnegotiations without reporting minutely to home officials far less\r\ninformed than they. To disavow the activity of a local representative\r\nin China, except under absolute necessity, is to discredit the whole\r\nnegotiation. The representative who should wield great influence is\r\nsuddenly reduced to the dimensions of a clerk with whom the Chinese\r\nwill not take up anything of importance thereafter.\r\n\r\nThat the Americans would not make a loan disappointed the Chinese\r\nofficials. They were used to looking for financial support to\r\npowerful groups, who desired or had obtained concessions. When, in\r\naddition, proposals came for many changes in the signed contracts, the\r\ndispleasure of the Chinese knew no limits. The storm broke just before\r\nthe funeral of Yuan Shih-kai. I was appealed to for aid in predisposing\r\nthe Chinese officials to look upon the new proposals with more favour.\r\nThe Minister of Communications as well as Mr. Chu Chi-chien, the\r\nMinister of the Interior, whom I interviewed, were dejected because\r\nthe loan had been so abruptly refused. They had counted on America to\r\ntake part in Chinese finance, in order that the Chinese Government\r\nmight not be entirely at the mercy of the Five-Power Consortium, or\r\nrather of Japan, which was now the only active member of that group.\r\nI tried to explain the action of the Americans on the basis of sound\r\nbusiness practice. I pointed out that in the United States, capital,\r\nindustry, and commerce are not mobilized for foreign enterprise as is\r\nthe case with the big foreign banking institutions of Europe. I tried\r\nto encourage them to set American firms to doing constructive work in\r\nChina, and assured them that out of such relationships there would\r\nnaturally grow a readiness to afford financial support.\r\n\r\nThey did not dispute my point, but, in the words of Cleveland, they\r\nfelt themselves confronted by a condition, not a theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nGUARDING THE \"OPEN DOOR\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNegotiations had been proceeding all through the autumn of 1916,\r\nbetween the Corporation and the Chinese Government, concerning the\r\nmodifications which the former desired to introduce into the Grand\r\nCanal contract signed in May. The negotiations on the part of the\r\nChinese were in the hands of the Minister of Agriculture, and of Mr.\r\nPan Fu, a young Shantung capitalist and official of progressive ideas.\r\nAs the Minister of Agriculture was not well disposed, it was found\r\ndifficult to get him to agree to the additional advantages which the\r\nCorporation desired to secure before finally ratifying the contract.\r\nShortly before Christmas, however, a basis of agreement had been\r\nreached. Just at this time there came from America the astonishing\r\nnews that the American corporation had invited Japanese capitalists to\r\ncoöperate in this contract, on condition that such coöperation would be\r\nacceptable to the Chinese Government.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the American corporation in Peking had no\r\nthought nor inkling whatsoever of this change in policy. The step had\r\nbeen taken without warning and without consulting either the American\r\nGovernment or the representatives of the company in China. It may be\r\nimagined in what position it left the latter, to whom the Chinese had\r\nentrusted these important rights solely because of the confidence\r\nthey had in Americans, both as to their ability to carry through\r\nan enterprise of this kind, and as to their complete freedom from\r\nall political afterthought. Unmindful of the fiduciary relationship\r\nwhich their representatives had established in China, the American\r\ncorporation, without first sounding the Chinese and without giving\r\nany intimation to the American Government--through whose approval and\r\nsupport they had been able to gain these rights--turned around and made\r\nan agreement to bring the subjects of another nation into the contract.\r\nIt is to be doubted if the nationals of any other country would have\r\nacted in this manner.\r\n\r\nIf the action had been taken out of deference to rights which the\r\nJapanese might claim in the future as a part of a sphere of influence\r\nto be asserted in Shantung, then indeed it was one of superlative\r\ninternational courtesy. New York bankers, however, were at this time\r\nstill notoriously the most timid beings known to experience, when\r\nit came to matters of foreign investment. To make up for this they\r\ndid, when they once got started, throw away American money in amazing\r\nquantities on reckless foreign enterprises in Europe and South America.\r\n\r\nWhat made this action so inexcusable was not that Japanese coöperation\r\nhad been invited or accepted, but that the one enterprise selected for\r\nsuch coöperation was the one in which America, through the National\r\nRed Cross, had long been interested and which had been committed to\r\nAmericans as a special mark of confidence. One might have thought that\r\ngoodwill to the Japanese might have been amply demonstrated had our\r\npeople declared their complete readiness to coöperate on any one of\r\nthe numerous unfinished enterprises which the Japanese controlled in\r\nManchuria and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt was no easy task for the representatives of the American corporation\r\nto tell the Chinese what had been done in New York. The proviso that\r\nthe arrangement was conditional upon its being acceptable to the\r\nChinese was of course pathetically ineffectual, because after the\r\narrangement made in New York the Chinese could certainly not refuse\r\nto accept any outside partners without giving very serious offence\r\nto them. I told the Chinese that we wished them to act with perfect\r\nfreedom and consult their own best interests in dealing with the\r\nAmerican corporation. But the Premier met all my explanations with:\r\n\"What can we do? The corporation has tied our hands.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chinese had shown special favour and bestowed their contracts\r\nupon the American nation; by their own act Americans had changed this\r\ndisposal in such a way as to let in a third party. Personally, I had\r\nnot the least objection to the Japanese or any other nation; although\r\nit seemed that in China coöperation with the Chinese would be the\r\nnormal method. Yet my experience with the Hukuang railways had made me\r\nvery doubtful of the practical advantages of international coöperation\r\nin industry. It is a cumbersome, expensive way of doing business,\r\nfull of delay and circumlocution. I felt that the different nations\r\nshould mutually facilitate each other's enterprises and coöperate in\r\nconstructive planning from which all might derive advantage; but I felt\r\nstrongly that individual enterprises should be managed by a particular\r\ngroup or corporation without complicated international machinery.\r\n\r\nThe railway concessions made to the Siems-Carey Company, which were\r\nto be financed by the American International Corporation, were also\r\nmaking trouble. Protests were made by the Russian Legation with regard\r\nto the alignment from Tatungfu toward Lanchow; these rested upon an old\r\nassurance given by the Chinese to Russia that any line northward or\r\neastward from Peking and Kalgan should first invite Russian capital.\r\nBut the protests had a weak leg to stand on, for the proposed line led\r\nsouthwestward from Kalgan, away from Russia's dominions. They had the\r\nless force in that the European Powers could not at this time furnish\r\nmoney for the construction of the much-needed railways which had been\r\ncommitted to their care; the more need, therefore, that America, which\r\nhad means, should build other necessary railways to provide China with\r\ninter-provincial transit.\r\n\r\nBut that was the method of diplomacy--to hunt about for some ground of\r\nprotest to the Chinese Government, in order to obtain from it a few\r\ncounterbalancing advantages. The American policy of equal opportunity\r\nhad the verbal agreement of the other important powers, but we had\r\nto be vigilant if Americans were to be protected in their right to\r\ndo business in various parts of China on the basis of this policy.\r\nEverywhere we met attempts to solidify the inchoate desires and lusts\r\nto secure exclusive rights, until the \"spheres of influence\" should be\r\nfirmly outlined.\r\n\r\nI always took the position with the Russian minister that the American\r\nconcession in this case did not conflict with any promise given to\r\nRussia. He spoke to me about the wish of Russia to use Mongolia as a\r\nprotective barrier. If Mongolia were to be developed through railways\r\nand colonization, he felt that friction between Russia and China might\r\ncome about through this mutual approach of large populations. To keep\r\nso vast a territory barren and unproductive just to serve as frontier\r\nmarches seemed to me unjustifiable. But I did not dispute the policy,\r\nrather insisting that a railway that connected one of the eighteen\r\nprovinces of China with another could have but remote bearing on the\r\nfears expressed by my Russian colleague. I told him the survey would go\r\non, but whether the road would be built would depend upon the judgment\r\nof the engineers as to whether it would be commercially profitable. The\r\nconversations were very leisurely. He did not say so, but I could see\r\nthat the minister fully expected the Americans to go ahead, while he\r\nwould use his protests as a means of getting some \"compensation\" out of\r\nthe Chinese.\r\n\r\nI was therefore not a little surprised when on one of my visits to him\r\nthe Russian minister met me with a quizzical smile, and handed me a\r\ntelegram which he had just received from Washington. The dispatch was\r\nfrom the Russian ambassador, and read in substance as follows:\r\n\r\n A representative of the American International Corporation has\r\n just called on me. He stated that the corporation regretted beyond\r\n measure that the impression had been given that it might contemplate\r\n undertakings in China which would be unwelcome to the Russian\r\n Government, and to which the latter would object. He stated that it\r\n was far from the intention of the corporation to do anything in China\r\n that would thus be objectionable to the Russian Government.\r\n\r\nNever was the ground cut from under any one exerting himself to\r\nsafeguard the interests of others as was done in this case. There was\r\nnothing to do but to say: \"They are very courteous, and wish to save\r\nyour susceptibility. They would probably not ask for any branches in\r\nthe direction of Urga, and confine themselves just to building the main\r\nline to Kansu.\" The Russian minister did not take an undue advantage of\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe next protest came from the French Legation. They had dug up a note\r\nsent them on September 26, 1914, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof that time. This note, conveying an entirely unnecessary gift by\r\nthat good-natured minister, had been kept secret; it acknowledged the\r\nhandsome manner assumed by the French minister during the negotiations\r\nabout a small frontier incident. Just to show absence of ill feeling,\r\nthe Foreign Minister assured the French minister that in case in future\r\nany mining or railway enterprises were to be undertaken in the Province\r\nof Kwangsi, French capital would be consulted first. It was a grim joke\r\nthat an official should thus light-heartedly and without _quid pro\r\nquo_ sign away important rights in contravention to all the announced\r\npolicies of his and other governments, including that to which the\r\ngrant was made. The French protest related to the southern part of the\r\nline from Chuchow in Honan, to Chinchow, on the coast of Kwangsi.\r\n\r\nI took the stand that the note which had turned up was contrary to the\r\nexpressed policy of the various governments concerned, and could have\r\nno bearing on the relations of American citizens with China; moreover,\r\nit had been secret, and neither the public nor any other government\r\nknew about it. As the French minister whom the Chinese had asked the\r\nFrench Government to withdraw because of his domineering attitude was\r\nnot at this time complacent in this or any other matter, I suggested\r\nthat the Department of State take up this question directly with the\r\nFrench Minister for Foreign Affairs. I expressed the hope that the\r\nFrench, our military and diplomatic associates, would wish particularly\r\nto adhere \"to the letter and the spirit of the declarations of equal\r\ncommercial opportunities.\"\r\n\r\nThe Continental Commercial Bank Loan had been announced in November,\r\n1916. I was happy that this result had been achieved. An advance of\r\nonly $5,000,000 was made, but even that small sum was an important\r\naid to the Chinese Government. The fact that a big Western financial\r\ninstitution had taken up relations with China was promising. What\r\nforeign banking there was in New York was tangled up with European\r\ninterests, followed the lead of London, and had not manifested much\r\nreadiness to exert itself for the development of American interests\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nThe French protested this loan because it carried the security of the\r\ntobacco and wine tax which had been assigned to some previous French\r\nloans. I saw Doctor Chen, and Count Martel called on me. I took the\r\nposition that as the French loan--which was small in amount and would\r\nrequire only a very minor portion of the proceeds of the tax--remained\r\nentitled to be the first lien, the French interests were in no way\r\nprejudiced. I imagine, what they really objected to was the eventual\r\nappointment of an American auditor or co-inspector for this revenue. As\r\nthis, however, would go to strengthen the security for their loan, I\r\ndo not see that they had any reason for complaint. The representative\r\nof the French bank which was interested saw me and made a tentative\r\nsuggestion that if adviserships were established the French might take\r\nthe wine tax, and the Americans the tobacco tax. I felt, however, that\r\nthe hands of the Chinese were perfectly free when the loan was made;\r\nthere could be no objection, except on the supposition that wherever\r\nthe Chinese do business, no matter how small, with respect to any\r\nsubject matter, they impliedly give a lien on all future dealings. To\r\nthe general suggestion of American-French coöperation in matters for\r\nwhich both parties could find capital, I was by no means averse.\r\n\r\nIn this same month the affairs relating to the Standard Oil Company's\r\nexploration were finally wound up. The geological experts they sent\r\nover had not \"struck\" oil enough to pay. Drilling expeditions had come\r\nover, which by the spring of 1915 had found traces of oil, and the\r\nChinese were considering giving them further areas for investigation.\r\nBut as they wished to modify their contract relating to production and\r\nrefining activities, Mr. E.W. Bemis, vice-president of the company,\r\ncame on and negotiated for a whole summer with the officials. He left\r\nwithout concluding an agreement. Not only had he received the support\r\nof the Legation at Peking and of the American Government, but the\r\nChinese were anxious to extend the privileges of exploration; his\r\ndecision to abandon the negotiations must therefore have been based\r\non a total change of policy. The company had apparently decided not\r\nto develop production in China, but to continue merely its marketing\r\nbusiness. It was to be expected that competitors would be discouraged\r\nfrom undertaking similar explorations. Mr. Hsiung Hsi-ling, ex-Premier\r\nand chief of the National Oil Administration, called on me at this time\r\nand gave me an account of his final negotiations with the company. He\r\nhad offered to establish a joint Chinese and American enterprise if\r\nmore extensive search should reveal oil deposits of great value.\r\n\r\nThe mineral situation in China was being surveyed during this time\r\nby representatives of the New York Orient Mines Company, Mr. John\r\nW. Finch, Dr. F. Bain, and Mr. Joseph E. Johnson, Jr. The attitude\r\nof these men, whose training as observers and clean-cut scientific\r\nmethods gave their conclusions a particular cogency and definiteness,\r\ninterested me. They had found that the iron deposits of China were not\r\nso extensive as is usually supposed. They believed, also, that the\r\nmarket for iron products could only gradually be developed with the\r\ngrowth of the general industry. They had analyzed the organization of\r\nthe Hanyehping Iron Works, and learned that its lack of success was due\r\nto faulty planning, which necessitated the bringing of both the coal\r\nand iron ore from a distance to the central point of manufacture. They\r\nbelieved that for the time there was room for only one first-class iron\r\nand steel enterprise in China. As smaller enterprises would hardly pay,\r\nthey favoured a national industrial plant, to be equipped on a scale to\r\nassure every advantage of short transport and economic production. The\r\nPremier gave them permission to investigate China's ore deposits, with\r\na view to suggesting a basis upon which a national industry could be\r\nfounded with temporary American financial assistance.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government had fully decided to adhere to its policy of\r\nnationalizing the iron deposits, and the decree already issued by Yuan\r\nShih-kai was to be reënacted by parliament. The Chinese were eager to\r\nestablish a national steel industry. It should help supply the national\r\nneeds for iron products, with the aid, if necessary, of foreign\r\ncapital. They would not take the sole assistance of the Japanese,\r\nbecause they knew that in that case the Chinese industry would be\r\nconfined to the production of pig-iron and would become the slave of\r\nthe steel industry of Japan. China would furnish raw materials; Japan,\r\nthe finished products.\r\n\r\nAnother secret agreement, this time with Japan, came to light. A loan\r\nof 3,000,000 yen had been concluded with Japanese banks in the latter\r\npart of 1916, and the secret agreement attached thereto gave Japanese\r\ninterests the right to meet the lowest price of any competitor in\r\nbidding on any materials for the Chinese telephone and telegraph\r\nservice. Of course, this would have destroyed the equal opportunity\r\nfor other nationals in this business. The contract had been signed\r\nby a notoriously corrupt official, who was completely under Japanese\r\ninfluence and had since fled to escape prosecution for corruption.\r\n\r\nI protested strongly. I told the Minister of Communications that the\r\nprovision was monopolistic, therefore in conflict with the treaties.\r\nHis answer disavowed the existence of the provision. But I knew it did\r\nexist among the original agreements; nevertheless, the awards actually\r\nmade at this time, after my protest, were in accordance with the bids\r\nsubmitted, and with the recommendations of the experts.\r\n\r\nIn a talk I had with the Premier during the spring of 1917 I advised\r\nhim to take up quickly the offer of the American International\r\nCorporation to float the first bond issue of $6,000,000 on the\r\nrailway to be constructed by the Siems-Carey Company. The Ministry of\r\nCommunications was obstructing it, acting under Japanese influences. I\r\ntold the Premier that Mr. Carey's authority to conclude the loan might\r\nbe revoked at any time, whereupon he promised to instruct the acting\r\nVice-Minister of Communications to complete the transaction forthwith.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Communications was then in charge of one Chuan Liang,\r\nwho had, in fact, long been considered as representing the Japanese\r\nelement. He had married a Japanese woman. Chuan refused obstinately,\r\nfirst, to take up the negotiations, then, to advance them when they\r\nwere begun. The rate of interest and terms of issue offered were fair,\r\nconsidering existing market values; but the American company agreed to\r\nmake a concession and raise the issue price.\r\n\r\nChuan continued to be stubborn. I spoke to the Premier, General Tuan,\r\nabout it; President Li himself gave his support, and the orders to\r\nmake the loan were thus reënforced. Still delay. After General Tuan's\r\nretirement, Dr. Wu Ting-fang as acting Premier again issued orders,\r\nwhich were repeated for the third time by General Chiang when he, in\r\nturn, displaced Doctor Wu. All these high officials concurred. Yet, in\r\nan astounding manner, the acting vice-minister, together with a ring of\r\npetty officials in his ministry and in the cabinet office, blocked the\r\ncarrying out of the orders issued by the President, the Premier, and\r\nthe whole cabinet.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Wu Ting-fang was anxious to see the contract carried out. He\r\nsuggested that I write a note demanding its execution, which I did on\r\nJune 6th. Wu intended to have the successive orders published in the\r\n_Government Gazette_, and, thus published, to be communicated to me\r\nofficially by the Foreign Office in response to my note. But the petty\r\nring delayed the publication. Meanwhile, the answer of the acting\r\nvice-minister was prepared and inserted in the _Government Gazette_\r\non the 27th, before the Foreign Office could communicate it to me. It\r\npresented unfairly the proposals of the American company, its language\r\nwas almost insulting.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time the high Chinese officials, who were my friends,\r\nwere at a loss to explain to me how this subordinate's defiance of\r\ntheir orders could be successful. They intimated that the obstruction\r\nmust be due to Japanese influence exercised in opposition to American\r\nenterprise in China. We noted that immediately upon publication of\r\nthe vice-minister's answer and before we knew about it ourselves, a\r\nsecretary of the Japanese Legation quite officiously expressed to one\r\nof the American secretaries his surprise at such a publication.\r\n\r\nBut by this act the vice-minister had overstepped the mark. The\r\nleaders of the Communications party, who were holding aloof from\r\npolitics with General Tuan, strongly condemned Chuan, who had always\r\nbeen dependent on them. He showed a remarkable change. He even sent\r\nemissaries to me, pleading for forgiveness and stating that he was in\r\nno way animated by hostility to American interests, but had acted on an\r\nhonest though mistaken view of the transaction.\r\n\r\nCalling on me on July 2nd, he repeated his apology. On the 30th of June\r\nthe Ministry of Communications had formally accepted the offer of funds\r\nby the American company. Thereafter negotiations were again interrupted\r\nby political changes and disturbances.\r\n\r\nThis incident will serve to illustrate the complexity of Chinese\r\naffairs, and the condition of disorganization in which the Chinese\r\nGovernment was at this time.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a Chino-American Industrial Bank was the subject of\r\nmany discussions I had with Chinese officials and financiers. This\r\noccupied a good deal of my attention during 1918, while Mr. Hsu\r\nUn-yuen, after his retirement from the presidency of the Bank of China,\r\nwas devoting his time to working out a plan and securing the support\r\nof prominent Chinese for this undertaking. Mr. Hsu Sing-loh was also\r\nworking on it independently; Mr. Hsu was secretary of the Minister\r\nof Finance, educated in England, and exceptionally well informed. In\r\nDecember of 1918 I accompanied Mr. Hsu to the house of Mr. Yang, a\r\ncapitalist interested in the China Merchants Steamship Company, where\r\nwe met with the Premier, Mr. Chien Neng-hsun, and Mr. Chou Hsueh-hsi,\r\nwho had recently been Minister of Finance. Here we talked over matters\r\nof banking and finance, with Mr. Chou leading the conversation. He was\r\nsure the Government would give a favourable charter that would enlist\r\nthe necessary capital. Chinese ideas about an industrial bank were\r\nvague; in some mysterious way it was thought that it could produce\r\ncapital for developing industries, or, rather, could manifold its\r\ncapital for such uses. Three industries were ready--cotton, steel,\r\nand scientific agriculture--for an extensive development. He did not\r\nknow how bad it is for a bank to lock up its capital in long-time\r\ncommitments. I asked those present as to how ready the Chinese public\r\nwould be to absorb the long-term bonds. Mr. Chou thought they would\r\ntake them, if strongly backed, at a relatively low interest. All\r\ndesired to go ahead. Ultimately the bank was founded, but by another\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nBefore parting on that day our wealthy host brought forth from the\r\nstrong-boxes many great treasures of Chinese art, including paintings\r\nof the Sung and Ming periods. China boasts only one museum. Only\r\nthrough seeing such private collections can one form an estimate of the\r\nrichness and extent of Chinese art treasures. For an hour I looked on\r\ndelightedly while one after another of these precious works of Chinese\r\npainting were unrolled before us. Chinese pictures are very modest.\r\nThey come out when called, but retire again readily to the quiet\r\nof the storeroom. Also, darkness has not the dulling effect on the\r\nwater-colours used by Chinese painters that it exercises upon pictures\r\ndone in oils.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, Minister Chow and other prominent officials had been\r\ninterested in a savings bank combined with a lottery, which announced\r\nthe sale of so-called premium bonds. There were to be quarterly\r\ndrawings, at which a certain number of the bonds would receive prizes,\r\nranging as high as $100,000. Mr. Chow explained to me that it would be\r\nfutile for a Chinese savings bank to offer a matter of 5 or 6 per cent.\r\ninterest for funds. Nobody would heed it, because of the profitableness\r\nof commercial enterprise. In order to strike public attention and\r\nto cause people to bring their money for deposit, the inducement\r\nof winning a large amount must be provided. The assurance that the\r\noriginal deposit itself would not be lost, but would ultimately be\r\nrepaid, would be the second attraction.\r\n\r\nThe minister said that it was the plan of the bank to reduce the amount\r\nof prizes and to increase their number so that gradually the payment of\r\na reasonable interest would be approached, as the people got accustomed\r\nto the idea of placing their funds in such an institution. The fact\r\nthat this country, whose people are so frugal and parsimonious and\r\nwhere there is so much accumulated capital, should hitherto have been\r\nwithout savings banks appears remarkable to a stranger. But the high\r\nreturn on commercial loans, and the ever-present gambling instinct of\r\nthe Chinese, account to some extent for this absence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nA DIARY OF QUIET DAYS, AUTUMN OF 1916\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 3_: Judge Elbert H. Gary has just been in Peking for ten\r\ndays with Mrs. Gary and a small party. I took them to call on President\r\nLi who is now living in a private residence with extensive rockeries\r\nand gardens, in the East City. We threaded our way to a central\r\npavilion where the President received us. He talked amiably about his\r\ndesire to see the great resources of China developed with American\r\ncoöperation. In the evening I gave a dinner to Judge Gary and the new\r\nMinisters of Finance and Communications. Charles A. Coolidge, the\r\nBoston architect, was also present. On the following day I arranged for\r\nthe American guests to see the Winter Palace; Mr. Coolidge afterward\r\nsaid to me that the trip through the palace grounds had been the\r\nmost interesting experience of his life from the point of view of\r\narchitectural beauty. Someone with Judge Gary told me that every lunch,\r\nafternoon reception, and dinner engagement, for the entire stay in\r\nJapan, was already arranged for, together with many engagements for\r\nbreakfast; adding: \"The Japanese certainly know a great man when they\r\nsee him, more than the Chinese.\" As a matter of fact, the Chinese are\r\nso unartificial that they do not think of organizing their hospitality\r\nto any distinguished guest. What they do is quite spontaneous; they are\r\ntruly hospitable, but they do not understand the first elements of the\r\nart of advertising.\r\n\r\n_September 9_: I took a trip to Dajessu with the Austrian minister.\r\nThis temple lies about twelve miles beyond the summer palace. We walked\r\npart of the way; a Chinese fell in with us, and, as is customary,\r\nopened conversation. Without seeming unduly inquisitive he elicited\r\ninformation about the size of our families, our age, income, and the\r\ncost of our clothing, the material of which he greatly admired. When\r\nthe Austrian minister told him that he had about four hundred men under\r\nhim, our companion looked rather dubious, and finally asked: \"Why,\r\nthen, if you have so many attendants, are you walking?\" The explanation\r\nthat we preferred to walk did not seem to remove his doubts. He told us\r\nin turn all the details of his family and business affairs.\r\n\r\nWe spent the week-end at the beautiful temple, from which we took\r\nwalks to the surrounding mountainside. A deserted temple on a high\r\nhill overlooking the valley is picturesque as any castle on the Rhine.\r\nWe ascended to the summer residence of Mr. Hsu Un-yuen, a temple\r\nperched on a precipitous spur of the main mountain range. The temple\r\nhad evidently been erected originally for a semi-residential purpose,\r\nthough it was in a quite inaccessible place, where neither worshippers\r\nnor vacationists would ordinarily have sought it out. We found Mr. Hsu\r\nand his wife enjoying the magnificent view from a terrace opening out\r\nfrom the living apartments.\r\n\r\n_September 13_: I gave a dinner to Mr. C.T. Wang, the vice-president\r\nof the senate, and a few representative members of parliament. We\r\nengaged in a general after-dinner discussion of politics. Most of the\r\nmen present were Progressives. They argued volubly. The arguments\r\nand illustrations were such as one would hear in a Western country.\r\nI missed, as usual, a thorough discussion of underlying facts,\r\ntraditions, and practices of Chinese life, out of which institutions\r\nshould develop. I mentioned this; Mr. Wang said that they needed\r\na guiding principle of organization, which they must get from the\r\nexperience of constitutional countries. The question uppermost was\r\nthe proposed election of provincial governors by the people of the\r\nrespective provinces, instead of their appointment by the Central\r\nGovernment. Most of those present considered this change necessary,\r\nas through union and mutual support the appointive military governors\r\ncould exercise great power and defeat the aims of Parliament.\r\n\r\n_September 14_: Failing to get financial assistance from America,\r\nthe Chinese have been considering Japanese offers of loans. Dr.\r\nChen Chin-tao, forced by the situation and the importunities of the\r\nministers, who need money, has signed a preliminary agreement for a\r\nloan of eighty million yen, on which an advance of five million yen is\r\nto be paid over immediately.\r\n\r\n_September 18_: The House of Representatives to-day in secret session\r\ndiscussed the Japanese loan. I am informed that it was strongly\r\nattacked on the ground that certain mines in Hunan Province had been\r\npledged to secure the advance. The Minister of Finance was not present,\r\nthe vice-minister appearing to answer questions. The minister was\r\nviolently condemned for signing the preliminary agreement without\r\nthe consent of parliament. The argument was made that it related to\r\nan advance, but not to the main loan itself. That argument was not\r\nconsidered valid.\r\n\r\n_September 19_: Negotiations were concluded with the Minister of\r\nCommunications for a satisfactory adjustment of the American railway\r\ncontract. Most of the proposals made were accepted, so that the\r\nAmerican corporation ought certainly to be thoroughly well satisfied,\r\nconsidering all the changes and difficulties that have occurred since\r\nthe original contract was made. That of the 17th May was allowed\r\nto stand, the changes being introduced by way of annexes. After\r\nthe Chinese have thus gone to the limit of making the undertaking\r\nattractive to Americans, it is to be hoped that there will be no\r\nfurther delay; that, at least, some important constructive work will be\r\ndone by Americans.\r\n\r\n_September 21_: We welcomed a little son to-day in the family. I do\r\nnot know that any children were born to any American minister in Peking\r\nbefore our little daughter Pauline came, in February, 1915. The two\r\nlittle ones were born into a strange world in which parents may well\r\nfear for the health of their children, because of frequent epidemics.\r\nStill, aside from such visitations, the Peking climate seems to be most\r\nfavourable to children; they thrive and grow apace. Claire, the eldest\r\ndaughter, aside from a terrible attack of appendicitis in which Dr.\r\nM.A. Stewart, of the Navy, saved her life, has been the very spirit of\r\nhealth. The faithful Chinese servants surround the children with every\r\ncare.\r\n\r\n_October 3_: I gave a men's dinner, attended by the ministers of\r\nPortugal, Russia, and Japan, and by Mr. Obata, the Japanese counsellor;\r\nCount Martel, the French first secretary; Mr. Aglen, Inspector-General\r\nof Customs; Mr. Alston, the British counsellor; Mr. Herrera de Huerta,\r\nformerly Mexican Chargé; Mr. Mitrophanow, of the Russian Legation;\r\nDoctor Willoughby, Doctor McElroy of Princeton, and other guests. It\r\nwas really a dinner of welcome to the new Japanese minister, Baron\r\nHayashi, who has recently arrived to take the place of Mr. Hioki. It\r\nwas probably thought better to displace the minister upon whom had\r\nfallen the disagreeable duty of forcing through the Twenty-one Demands\r\nof 1915. Baron Hayashi, who had been ambassador in Italy, brings a long\r\ndiplomatic experience and very careful methods. He is very silent,\r\nspeaks little except when few or only one other person are present. In\r\na larger company or at a meeting, he gives the impression of detachment\r\nand deep reflection. In social intercourse he is more retiring than his\r\npredecessor. He impresses me as a thoughtful, fair-minded man.\r\n\r\n_October 4_: I am told that a guest at last night's dinner, a visitor\r\nfrom a distant country, complained because he had not been ranked with\r\nthe ministers. As I had no information, nor have it now, that he was\r\nentitled to such ranking, I shall not worry. This is the first instance\r\nof any dissatisfaction with the seating. My predecessor related to\r\nme that a secretary of the British Legation once took his sudden\r\ndeparture before dinner for this reason. I have not always closely\r\nadhered to rank in seating, particularly at dinners where there are\r\nChinese, in order to avoid a grouping which should make conversation\r\nimpossible; but in such cases, of course, I always speak to whichever\r\nguest is slightly prejudiced by the arrangement and explain the reason\r\nto him. I have never noticed the least sign of displeasure. At a very\r\nformal dinner, it is of course always safer to follow rank and let the\r\nconversation take care of itself. Any enjoyment people get out of such\r\na dinner they set down as pure profit, anyhow.\r\n\r\n_October 7_: Ambassador and Mrs. Guthrie arrived to-day. They will be\r\nour guests for several weeks. Mr. Guthrie has not been very well, so\r\nhas come for a rest. We spent the day together, talking over Chinese\r\nand Japanese affairs and relations. We agree on most points.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we dined at the officers' mess, after which there was\r\ndancing. Mrs. Ollie James and Mrs. Hall of Washington came with the\r\nGuthries. They were at the dinner, at which great cheer prevailed.\r\nColonel Neville, the new commandant of the marines, radiates good\r\nfellowship. He is sociable, efficient, and ready to coöperate in all\r\ngood causes. His officers and men seem to revere him, and a very fine\r\nspirit reigns in the marine compound.\r\n\r\n_October 11_: I presented Ambassador Guthrie to the President, who\r\nhad invited us for luncheon. We were only six at the table. Mr. Quo\r\nTai-chi, the youthful English-speaking secretary of the President,\r\ninterpreted. The President had many questions to ask about Japan.\r\nThen, he spoke quite hopefully about the outlook in China. Financial\r\ndifficulties will be overcome through coöperation of parliament and\r\nthe cabinet, so that the Government may count on popular consent to an\r\nincrease in taxes.\r\n\r\nPresident Li now occupies the palace where Yuan Shih-kai had lived. We\r\nmet in a small apartment in the building constructed for the Empress\r\nDowager, which was tastefully furnished in the best Chinese style.\r\n\r\n_October 13_: The dinner season has fully set in. There are dinners\r\nevery night, and will be, throughout the winter. This evening we\r\nentertained for the Guthries, having Prince Koudacheff, Baron Hayashi,\r\nand the wives of the Russian and Danish ministers, who are themselves\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\n_October 23_: The Political Science Association met at my house. The\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs presided. Doctor W.W. Willoughby and\r\nSenator Yen Fu, the noted scholar, read papers. Over a hundred men were\r\nin attendance--the cream of the Western-educated officials, as well as\r\nEuropean and American members.\r\n\r\n_October 29_: The Guthries left yesterday. To-day arrived General and\r\nMrs. Liggett, who will be our guests for a few days. General Liggett is\r\ntall and impressive-looking. We had a long initial conversation about\r\nthe effects of the war in the Far East. The Philippines are beginning\r\nto be prosperous on account of the war demand for their products.\r\n\r\n_October 31_: I presented General Liggett to President Li. In a long\r\nconversation the President was frank in his statement concerning the\r\ninternational difficulties of China. He expressed himself in strong\r\nterms as desirous of close coöperation with America. I gathered that\r\nhe feared that certain foreign influences might stir up trouble\r\nbetween the parliament and the Government, and otherwise seek to cause\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\n_November 3_: I went with a small party to the mountain temple\r\nDjetaissu. Mrs. Chadbourne, the sister of my friend Mr. Charles R.\r\nCrane; Miss Ellen Lamotte the writer; Mr. and Mrs. Burns of Shanghai;\r\nand Mr. Charles Stevenson Smith, of the Associated Press, took this\r\nexcursion riding on donkeys, with many spills as the animals slipped on\r\nthe rocky road. The temple is near the top, commanding a magnificent\r\nview of the plains and of the higher mountains farther inland. It rises\r\ntier above tier, its platforms shaded by huge trees, with enchanting\r\nvistas of architecture and a broad sweep of view in all directions.\r\n\r\n_November 9_: The Continental Commercial Bank Loan is announced. I am\r\nhappy that this result has been achieved. An advance of only $5,000,000\r\nwill be made, but even that small sum will be an important aid to the\r\nChinese Government. The fact that a big Western financial institution\r\nhas taken up relations with China is promising. What foreign banking\r\nthere is in New York is tangled up with European interests, follows the\r\nlead of London, and has not manifested much readiness to exert itself\r\nfor the development of American interests abroad.\r\n\r\n_November 10_: I attended the balloting for the election of the\r\nVice-President of the Republic, at a joint session of the two houses\r\nof parliament. While no speeches were made, with the exception of\r\nbrief discussion on points of order, yet it was of interest to see\r\nthe general aspect of parliament. The procedure, certainly, was\r\nbusiness-like. Balloting was by written and signed vote; after each\r\nballot, the individual votes are read off from the tribune. I had the\r\nimpression that a true election was going on. General Feng Kuo-chang,\r\nthe Military Governor of Kiangsu, had the lead from the start, which\r\nwas gradually increased by the balloting until finally he got the\r\nnecessary majority. I could not stay until the result was announced,\r\nwhen there was a demonstration to honour the nominee. But I saw before\r\nme a body which had evidently mastered the procedure of parliamentary\r\naction, so that things were done with a smoothness and ease which\r\nimplied long experience. Many people witnessed the election, among them\r\nseveral of my colleagues. I had a brief conversation with Mr. C.T.\r\nWang, who was hopeful that, now the Vice-Presidential succession was\r\nsettled legally and peacefully, the future of the Republic was assured.\r\n\r\nGeneral Feng has occupied a pivotal position at his post at Nanking. He\r\nis shrewd and clever. Like a boy standing over the centre of a seesaw,\r\nhe used his weight to balance either side according as the pendulum\r\nmovement required. He was at first believed to have given Yuan Shih-kai\r\nencouragement to be emperor, but when asked to express himself, had\r\nallowed the report that he was neutral to gain currency; then, as\r\nthe opposition gained strength, he added his weight with gradually\r\nincreasing force to its side, although never at any stage coming out\r\nwith positive statements. His selection was an attempt to form a\r\ncompromise between the militarist and the progressive parties.\r\n\r\n_November 10_: I took a long excursion with Prince Koudacheff. We rode\r\nto the foothills by automobile, then climbed to the top of a lofty\r\nrange back of his temple, where one can promenade for six or eight\r\nmiles along the crest of the ridge with glorious views of mountain\r\ncountry on either side.\r\n\r\n_November 15_: I had a long conversation with Baron Hayashi to-day.\r\n\r\n_November 20_: Admiral and Mrs. Winterhalter arrived for a few days'\r\nvisit. The Admiral is tall, gray-haired, strong-featured, of energetic\r\nmovements. He has always manifested a deep interest in what is going on\r\nin China; we sat down for a long talk immediately after his arrival.\r\n\r\n_November 22_: I presented the Admiral to President Li and we had\r\na pleasant conversation, although the President was not quite so\r\nexpansive and confidential as during my last call. As we made the\r\nrounds of calls on the cabinet ministers, I took the conversation\r\nbeyond the ordinary civilities, so as to give the visitor an\r\nopportunity of getting more insight into the affairs now engaging our\r\nattention; also, to use this valuable time for an exchange of ideas\r\nwith the Chinese leaders.\r\n\r\n_November 25_: The French are protesting against the Continental\r\nCommercial Bank Loan, in so far as the security is concerned. The\r\nsecurity of the tobacco and wine tax had been assigned to some previous\r\nFrench loans. I saw Doctor Chen, and Count Martel called on me. I\r\ntake the position that as the French loan--which is small in amount\r\nand will require only a very minor portion of the proceeds of the\r\ntax--remains entitled to be the first lien, the French interests are in\r\nno way prejudiced. I imagine what they really object to is the eventual\r\nappointment of an American auditor or co-inspector for this revenue. As\r\nthis, however, would still strengthen the security for their loan, I\r\ndo not see that they have any reason for complaint. The representative\r\nof the French bank which is interested, saw me and made a tentative\r\nsuggestion that if advisorships were established, the French might take\r\nthe wine tax, and the Americans the tobacco tax. I feel, however, that\r\nthe hands of the Chinese were perfectly free when the loan was made;\r\nthere can be no objection, except on the supposition that whenever the\r\nChinese do business, no matter how small, with respect to any subject\r\nmatter, they impliedly give a lien on all future dealings.\r\n\r\n_December 4_: I called on Doctor Morrison to take a look at his\r\nlibrary. This unusual collection contains about twenty thousand books\r\nin European languages, dealing with China. The rare editions of early\r\nworks are almost completely represented. Doctor Morrison, who lives in\r\na Chinese-style house, has built a fireproof building for his books.\r\nHe has devoted the last fifteen years to getting them together, and\r\nI believe has spent the larger part of his income on them. Recently\r\nhe married a lady who had been for a while his secretary. They now\r\nhave a little boy. I am told that his marriage and fatherhood have\r\ngreatly augmented Doctor Morrison's standing and influence among\r\nthe Chinese. A bachelor does not fit into their scheme of life. We\r\nrepaired to his study, and for a long time were discussing affairs.\r\nWe spoke particularly about the railway situation and the fact that\r\nconstruction on all the lines contracted for has practically been\r\nstopped. This is an enormous disadvantage to the Chinese. They have to\r\npay heavy interest charges on the initial loans, for which there is as\r\nyet no income-paying property to show, but only surveys and partial\r\nconstruction. We agreed that the Four-Power bankers, for instance, have\r\na very weak case if China should decide to cancel their contract for\r\nnon-performance, as money to continue the building is not forthcoming.\r\nOn the British concession of the Pukow-Singyang Railway, on which\r\nvirtually no work has yet been done, the Government nevertheless has to\r\npay interest on a million dollars of capital that has been advanced.\r\n\r\n_December 7_: I visited Prince Koudacheff, the Russian minister. I\r\njokingly asked him whether he found that the Chinese thought of the\r\nRussians as half-Asiatic, therefore as brothers. \"No,\" he replied;\r\n\"they count us with you and with the other Europeans, as a scourge and\r\npestilence.\" In this conversation the Prince uttered a prophecy. \"As a\r\nresult of this war,\" he said, \"the empire will be abolished in Germany.\"\r\n\r\n(Neither of us at this time dreamed of the enormous subversions and\r\nconvulsions which were soon to take place in Russia.)\r\n\r\n_December 8_: I called on President Li in order to present a personal\r\nletter from President Wilson, in which the latter sends his good\r\nwishes. We discussed the American loan policy. The President, like\r\nother Chinese, finds it difficult to understand why America, with\r\nher great capital strength and industrial development, is so slow in\r\ntaking advantage of opportunities for investment and development in\r\nChina. The President said: \"Americans love pioneering. In China there\r\nis pioneering to do, with the added advantage of having a ready labour\r\nsupply and local capital, which may be enlisted. Why are they so slow\r\nto come in?\" I agree with him that it is difficult to understand.\r\n\r\n_December 16_: Mr. Victor Murdock is in Peking, bringing a breeze\r\nof American good-fellowship, and a vision unobstructed by theories.\r\nHe finds China interesting, but, I fear, he will suffer the usual\r\ndisability of the passing visitor, that is, he will see the\r\nunfavourable aspects of Chinese life and will not stay long enough to\r\nappreciate the deeper virtues.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis diary account of some of the happenings during the fall of 1916\r\ncontains nothing of the daily work of conferences, discussions,\r\ninterviews, dictations dealing with the innumerable problems that come\r\nup from the consulates, or that arise in the capital directly, or\r\nreferring to general policies which are hammered out and formed for\r\naction.\r\n\r\nA great part of the work of a legation is concerned with foreseeing\r\ntrouble and trying to avoid it. Such work usually does not appear at\r\nall in the record. In a country where conditions are complicated as\r\nthey are in China, where there is such a crisscrossing of influences,\r\nit is easy to make a mistake if constant care be not exercised to keep\r\ninformed of every detail and to head off trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nCHINA BREAKS WITH GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time came for the United States to sever relations with the German\r\nKaiser's government. I had taken advantage of the clear sunshine and\r\nmild air on Sunday, February 4, 1917, to visit Doctor Morrison at his\r\ncottage outside of Peking near the race-course. After lunch a messenger\r\ncame from the Legation, bringing word that an important cablegram had\r\narrived and was being decoded. I returned to town, and at the Legation\r\nMr. White handed me the decoded message which said that the American\r\nGovernment had not only broken off diplomatic relations with Germany,\r\nbut that it trusted the neutral powers would associate themselves\r\nwith the American Government in this action of protest against an\r\nintolerable practice; this would make for the peace of the world. I was\r\ninstructed to communicate all this to the Chinese Government.\r\n\r\nAfter a conference with the first secretary, Mr. MacMurray, and the\r\nChinese secretary, Doctor Tenney, I made an engagement to see the\r\nPresident and the Premier on that same evening. I felt justified in\r\nassuming that the invitation to the neutrals to join the United States\r\nwas more than a pious wish and that there was some probability that\r\nthe European neutrals would support our protest. As to China I had\r\nalready informed the Government that we could reasonably expect support\r\nthere. I therefore considered it to be the policy of the Government to\r\nassure a common demonstration on the part of all neutral powers, strong\r\nenough to bring Germany to a halt. So far as my action was concerned,\r\nI therefore saw the plain duty to prevail upon China to associate\r\nherself with the American action as proposed by my government.\r\n\r\nI found President Li Yuan-hung resting after dinner in his palace\r\nand in an amiably expectant mood. With him was Mr. Quo Tai-chi, his\r\nEnglish secretary. He was plainly startled by the prospect of having to\r\nconsider so serious a matter, and did not at first say anything, but\r\nsat silently thinking. His doubts and objections were revealed rather\r\nthrough questions than by direct statements. \"What is the present state\r\nof the war, and what the relative strength or degree of exhaustion of\r\nthe belligerent parties?\" \"Could the Allies, even with the assistance\r\nof the United States, win a decisive victory?\" Finally, he said: \"The\r\neffect of such a far-reaching international act upon the internal\r\nsituation in China will have to be carefully considered.\"\r\n\r\nThe President's secretary appeared strongly impressed with the\r\nfavourable aspects of our proposal, so that he began to argue a little\r\nwith the President. On my part, I pointed out the effects which a\r\npositive act of international assertion in behalf of a just cause and\r\nwell-disposed associates would have upon China by taking attention off\r\nher endless factional conflicts. When I touched upon the ethical phases\r\nof the matter, the President fully agreed with me. I had particularly\r\nimpressed upon him the need of prompt action in order that counsels\r\nmight not be confused by adverse influences from without.\r\n\r\nWe next drove to the residence of the Premier, General Tuan Chi-jui,\r\nwho was then playing an important part in the politics Of China.\r\nI recalled my first interview with him when he had received me in\r\na dingy room, himself wearing a frowzy long coat and exhibiting a\r\ngeneral air of tedium and lack of energy. There was no suggestion of\r\nthe military man about him. The qualities upon which General Tuan's\r\ngreat influence is founded become apparent only upon a longer and more\r\nintimate acquaintance. Despite his real indolence, his wisdom, his\r\nfundamental honesty, and his readiness to shield his subordinates and\r\nto assume responsibility himself have made this quiet and unobtrusive\r\nman the most prominent leader among the Chinese militarists. His\r\ninterest centres chiefly in the education of military officers. He is\r\nno politician and is bored by political theory. He is always ready to\r\nturn over the handling of affairs to subordinates, by whom he is often\r\nled into a course which he might not himself have chosen. This, coupled\r\nwith extraordinary stubbornness, accounts for his influence often\r\ntending to be disastrous to his country. His personality, however, with\r\nits simplicity and pensiveness, and his real wisdom when he lets his\r\nown nature guide him, make him one of the attractive figures of China.\r\n\r\nThough in himself the principal influence in the Government, Tuan\r\nleft all details to his assistants, Mr. Tsao Ju-lin and General Hsu\r\nShu-cheng. He preferred to play chess. He was, however, always ready\r\nto shoulder responsibility for what his subordinates had done. Often\r\nwhen he was deep in a game of Chinese chess, his mind focussed on the\r\ncomplexities of this difficult pastime, General Hsu would approach\r\nhim with some proposal. Giving only half an ear to it, the Premier\r\nwould respond, \"All right\" (_How how_). When, later, the results of\r\nthe action thus taken turned out to be bad and the Premier asked for\r\nan explanation, he was reminded that he had himself authorized it.\r\nHe would then faintly recollect, and would make a gesture toward his\r\nshoulder, which indicated that--very well--he took the responsibility.\r\n\r\nBut on this occasion General Tuan was all attention. He had with\r\nhim Mr. C.C. Wu of the Foreign Office, who continued throughout\r\nthese negotiations to act as interpreter. The circumstance that the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Wu Ting-fang, was ill and had to\r\nbe represented by his son, and that in all important interviews both\r\nthe Premier and young Mr. Wu were present, greatly facilitated the\r\nbusiness and saved time which would have been needed to carry on\r\nparallel conversations in the Foreign Office and with the Premier.\r\nGeneral Tuan was far from accepting the proposal at first sight. \"It\r\nwould be wise for Germany to modify her submarine policy,\" he stated,\r\n\"because in land warfare she could press her opponents so seriously\r\nthat her absolute defeat would be difficult unless the United States\r\nentered the war.\" He appeared to contemplate the possibility of China\r\ntaking so unprecedented a step as the breaking of relations with a\r\ngreat power with less concern than did the President. We arranged for a\r\nlonger discussion on the following day.\r\n\r\nFar into that night I was in conference with the legation staff, and\r\nwith certain non-official Americans and Britishers of great influence\r\namong the Chinese. These men looked with enthusiasm upon the idea of\r\nan association with the United States, aligning against Germany the\r\nvast population of China. While the energies and resources of China\r\nwere not sufficiently mobilized to be of immediate use in the war,\r\nyet by systematic preparation they might bring an enormous accession\r\nof strength to the Allies if the war should last long. We felt,\r\nalso, that through positive alliance with the declared policy of the\r\nUnited States, China would greatly strengthen herself internally and\r\nexternally.\r\n\r\nDr. John C. Ferguson addressed himself directly to the Premier and\r\nthe President; his thorough knowledge of Chinese enabled him to\r\nbring home to them the essential points in favour of prompt action.\r\nMr. Roy S. Anderson and Mr. W.H. Donald, an Australian acting as\r\neditor of the _Far Eastern Review_, who were close to the members of\r\nthe Communications Party and the Kuo Min Tang, addressed themselves\r\nespecially to the leaders in parliament. Dr. G.E. Morrison, the British\r\nadviser of the President of China, had long worked to have China join\r\nin the war: he quietly used all his influence with the President and\r\nhigh officials, in order to make them understand what was at stake.\r\nOther Americans and British newspapermen, like Charles Stevenson Smith\r\nand Sam Blythe, who happened to be in Peking, all tirelessly working in\r\ntheir own way with men whose confidence they enjoyed, urged the policy\r\nproposed by America. These men made a spontaneous appeal based upon the\r\nfundamental justice of the policy of resisting an intolerable practice,\r\nand on the beneficent effect which a great issue like this would have\r\nin pulling the Chinese nation together and in making it realize its\r\nstatus as a member of the family of nations. However, what counted most\r\nwith the Chinese was the fact that America had acted, and had invited\r\nChina to take a similar step.\r\n\r\nAt a second long interview with the President, he asked me: \"Would not\r\na positive active foreign policy, particularly if it should lead to\r\nwar, strengthen the militarist party?\"\r\n\r\nI replied that in my opinion such a contingency would strengthen\r\ndecisively the Central Government, enabling it to keep the military in\r\ntheir proper place as an organ of the state and preventing the further\r\ngrowth of the pseudo-feudalism inherited from Yuan Shih-kai.\r\n\r\n\"But would the American Government assist China in bearing the\r\nresponsibilities of such a step?\"\r\n\r\nBefore replying to this question, I had to cable the Department of\r\nState for instructions as to what assurances I would be authorized to\r\ngive to the Chinese Government in the event of their taking the action\r\nsuggested by the United States. Unfortunately, as was several times the\r\ncase during some critical situation, the cable connection was broken\r\nand I failed to get any reply to assist me during the negotiations.\r\n\r\nWith a map the Premier and I, later that afternoon, analyzed the\r\nmilitary situation of the European Powers. From the analogy of the\r\nAmerican Civil War, I expressed to him the belief that Germany could\r\nnot resist the enormous pressure from all sides. \"What,\" the Premier\r\nasked, \"may be expected of America by way of direct military action?\r\nBear in mind that I wish for nothing more than for a strong America,\r\nable to exercise a guiding influence in the affairs of the world.\"\r\n\r\nMy positive belief that America would, if necessary, follow the\r\nseverance of relations with the strongest kind of military action\r\ninterested him. America had been represented to the Chinese as a big,\r\nover-rich country which lacked energy for a supreme military effort.\r\n\r\n\"What, then, will happen at the conclusion of the war?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Japan had already made efforts to assure for herself the\r\nright to speak for China was worrying the Chinese. With the Premier,\r\nas with the President, the idea that, through breaking with Germany,\r\nChina could assure herself of an independent position at the peace\r\ntable, had much weight. Both men also faced the possibility of being\r\ndrawn into the war. The Premier appeared to regard this with a certain\r\ndegree of positive satisfaction; to the President it seemed a less\r\nagreeable prospect. I made it plain that the American proposal did not\r\ngo beyond breaking off diplomatic relations with Germany, and, that\r\nby taking that step, China would effectually rebuke and discourage\r\nthe illegal and inhuman acts of Germany on the high seas, keeping her\r\nhands entirely free as to future action. Should further steps be later\r\nneeded, the road would be open.\r\n\r\nIntensive discussions were going on all day Monday and deep into the\r\nnight among the Chinese officials and the leaders of parliament. I\r\nreceived calls on Tuesday from many Chinese leaders who wished to talk\r\nover the situation. The progressive, modern-minded, and forward-looking\r\namong the Chinese readily supported the idea that China should range\r\nherself alongside the United States in this action. Admiral Tsai\r\nTing-kan, who was very close to the President, laboured in company with\r\nDoctor Morrison to bring before Li Yuan-hung all the considerations\r\nfavouring positive action. The President, however, still adhered to his\r\nidea that it was safer for China to remain entirely neutral.\r\n\r\nIn the cabinet, Dr. Chen Chin-tao, the Minister of Finance, and Mr.\r\nC.C. Wu, representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, from the\r\nearliest moment associated themselves with those of the opinion\r\nthat China must act, and they led the younger officials. In the Kuo\r\nMin Tang, Mr. C.T. Wang, vice-president of the senate; Dr. Wang\r\nChung-hui, the leading jurist of China; and General Niu Yung-chien,\r\nof revolutionary fame, were the first to become active. The Peking\r\n_Gazette_, with its brilliant editor, Eugene Chen, came out strongly\r\nin favour of following the United States. A powerful public opinion\r\nwas quietly forming among the Chinese. The Young China party was\r\nbeginning to see the advantage which lay in having China emerge from\r\nher passivity.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned from a dinner with the Alstons at the British Legation\r\non Tuesday night, Mr. C.C. Wu brought me word from the cabinet that\r\nit would be quite impossible to take action unless the American\r\nGovernment could adequately assure China assistance in bearing the\r\nresponsibilities which she might incur, without impairment of her\r\nsovereign rights and the independent control of her national forces.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese ministers had in mind two things: In the first place, the\r\nneed of financial assistance, in order to make it possible for China\r\neventually to participate in the war, if that should be desired; and,\r\nsecond, the prevention of all arrangements whereby Chinese natural\r\nresources, military forces, arsenals, or ships, would be placed\r\nunder foreign control incompatible with her undiminished national\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nAll through Wednesday I struggled with this difficult problem. I had\r\nto act on my own responsibility, as I could not reach the Department\r\nof State by cable. If all the influences unfavourable to the action\r\nproposed were given time to assert themselves, the American proposal\r\nwould be obstructed and probably defeated. The Chinese Government\r\nwould act only on such assurances as I could feel justified in giving\r\nto them at this time; if I gave them none, no action would be taken.\r\nIt seemed almost a matter of course, should China follow the lead of\r\nthe American Government, that the latter would not allow China to\r\nsuffer through lack of all possible support in aiding China to bear\r\nthe responsibilities she assumed, and in preventing action from any\r\nquarter which would impose on China new burdens because of her break\r\nwith Germany. Unable to interpret my instructions otherwise than that a\r\njoint protest of the neutrals had actually been planned by the American\r\nGovernment, and feeling that the effect upon Germany of the American\r\nprotest depended on the early concurrence of the important neutral\r\npowers, I considered prompt action essential. I was sure that all sorts\r\nof unfavourable and obstructive influences would presently get to work\r\nin Peking.\r\n\r\nWhen discussion had reached its limit, on the afternoon of February\r\n7th, I felt it necessary to draw up a note concerning the attitude of\r\nthe American Government. The tenor of this note I communicated to the\r\nPremier and the Foreign Office, with the understanding that I should\r\nsend the note if favourable action were decided upon by the Chinese\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nI believed that without such assurances the instructions of the\r\nAmerican Government could not be carried out, and that it would act\r\nin all respects in a manner consonant with its position as a powerful\r\ngovernment and as a leader of protest among the neutrals; moreover,\r\nthat its relations with those who gave support in a policy of such\r\nfundamental importance would be determined by principles of equity\r\nand justice. I felt that the United States could not be less liberal\r\ntoward a country coming to its support than toward those countries\r\nwhich the American Government was now going to help. It was only these\r\nself-evident conclusions which I cautiously expressed in my note. The\r\ntext of this note, in its essential part, had the following form:\r\n\r\n  Excellency:\r\n\r\n In our recent conversation concerning the policy of your Government in\r\n associating itself with the United States in active opposition to the\r\n unrestricted submarine warfare by which Germany is indiscriminately\r\n jeopardizing the lives of neutral citizens, you have with entire\r\n frankness pointed out to me that, whereas the Chinese Government is\r\n in principle disposed to adopt the suggestion of the President of\r\n the United States in that regard, it nevertheless finds itself in a\r\n position in which it would not feel safe in so doing unless assured\r\n that it could obtain from American sources such financial and other\r\n assistance as would enable it to take the measures appropriate to the\r\n situation which would thus be created.\r\n\r\n With like candour I have stated to you that I have recommended to my\r\n Government that in the event of the Chinese Government's associating\r\n itself with the President's suggestion, the Government of the United\r\n States should take measures to put at its disposition the funds\r\n immediately required for the purposes you have indicated, and should\r\n take steps with a view to such a funding of the Boxer Indemnity as\r\n would for the time being make available for the purposes of the\r\n Chinese Government at least the major portion of the current indemnity\r\n instalments; and I have indicated to you my personal conviction that\r\n my Government would be found just and liberal in effecting this or\r\n other such arrangements to enable the Chinese Government to meet\r\n the responsibilities which it might assume upon the suggestion of\r\n the President. I should not be wholly frank with you, however, if I\r\n were to fail to point out that the exact nature of any assistance\r\n to be given or any measure to be taken must be determined through\r\n consultation of various administrative organs, in some cases including\r\n reference to Congress, in order to make effective such arrangements\r\n as might have been agreed to in principle between the executive\r\n authorities of the two countries; and I therefore could not in good\r\n faith make in behalf of my Government any definite commitments upon\r\n your suggestions at the present time.\r\n\r\n I do, however, feel warranted in assuming the responsibility of\r\n assuring you in behalf of my Government that by the methods you have\r\n suggested, or otherwise, adequate means will be devised to enable\r\n China to fulfill the responsibilities consequent upon associating\r\n herself with the action of the United States Government, without any\r\n impairment of her national independence and of her control of her\r\n military establishment and general administration.\r\n\r\nFinal presentation of everything that had to be considered in making a\r\ndecision was arranged with the Premier for Wednesday evening. I found\r\nGeneral Tuan alone. We spoke awhile about the news of the day, then\r\nI began to go into the main matter. But General Tuan appeared weary\r\nand worried. This may have been the reason for the failure of the\r\ninterpreters to make smooth connection: I suggested, as the Premier had\r\nhad an excessively long day, that we meet again the following morning.\r\nIt was arranged for ten o'clock at the cabinet office, just before the\r\nThursday morning cabinet conference.\r\n\r\nI had just dined with Mr. C.T. Wang and a number of parliamentary\r\nleaders. They were keen on the policy of following the United States.\r\nThey had seen President Li during the day; he was still full of\r\ndoubts, but stated that he would leave the decision in the hands of\r\nthe cabinet, and would abide by the results. Mr. Wang believed that\r\nthe President was gradually coming around to the American point of\r\nview, and that his acceptance of it would be the stronger and heartier\r\nbecause of the conscientious doubts which he was overcoming.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations of these three days had gone on quietly. The men upon\r\nwhom rested the responsibility of making the decision were constantly\r\nin conference. Several men of influence worked with officials of the\r\nGovernment and leaders in parliament. But the outside foreign public\r\nwas not fully alive to what was going on, and those who knew and were\r\ninterested generally believed that ancient China would not take so\r\nunprecedented a step. The Japanese minister, Baron Hayashi, was absent\r\nfrom Peking. The German official representatives apparently had no idea\r\nthat any radical action could come from the Chinese Government.\r\n\r\nI arrived at the cabinet office on Thursday morning, at ten, and was\r\nshown to the room where the Premier was to receive me. As he had told\r\nme that Mr. C.C. Wu would be present to interpret, I had not brought\r\nan interpreter for this informal and intimate interview. The Premier\r\nsoon entered unattended and we sat down together, smoking cigarettes,\r\nand observing an enforced silence, as Mr. Wu had not appeared. We\r\nwere without an interpreter, but even in such circumstances the\r\nperfection of Chinese manners allows no embarrassment to arise. We had\r\nbeen sitting in mute thought a little while, when Admiral Chen, the\r\nMinister of the Navy, came in; he spoke English quite well, so that\r\nour conversation could begin; soon we were in the midst of earnest\r\ndiscussion. Within another ten minutes Dr. Chen Chin-tao, the Minister\r\nof Finance, arrived, and shortly after him came Mr. C.C. Wu. Thus,\r\nquite by chance, I had the opportunity of talking over these momentous\r\nmatters jointly with the representatives of the four departments of\r\ngovernment most nearly concerned: Foreign Affairs, Finance, War, and\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\nWe could now once more thoroughly go over all doubts and objections,\r\nand look at the proposed policy in all its manifold aspects and\r\nprobable results. In this intense and earnest conversation no formal\r\ninterpreting was needed. Whoever replied to my remarks would first\r\nrepeat in Chinese what I had said for the benefit of the Premier. When\r\nthe Premier had spoken, Mr. Wu would interpret his thought for me. All\r\nthe others addressed me directly in English. I advanced arguments on\r\nevery point, of which the following is a memorandum:\r\n\r\n The American Government has taken the present action because the\r\n wilful disregard of neutral rights went to the extent of imperilling\r\n not only neutral property, but the lives of our citizens. In this\r\n matter the interests of China are entirely parallel to those of the\r\n United States; both nations are peaceful and see in the maintenance\r\n of international right and peaceful conditions a vital guarantee of\r\n their national safety. Through association with the United States,\r\n China would enter upon this controversy with a position consonant with\r\n every tradition and interest of her national life, a position which\r\n would have to be respected by friends and foes alike, as dictated by\r\n the highest principles which could guide national action. By taking\r\n this action, China would improve her independent standing among the\r\n nations, she would have to be consulted during the course of the\r\n controversy and at the conclusion of the war; she would, in all this,\r\n be most closely associated with that nation which she has always\r\n looked upon as peculiarly friendly and just to her. In addition to\r\n these arguments, many favourable results were discussed which China\r\n would obtain in international diplomacy.\r\n\r\n Many arguments were advanced by the Chinese officials in doubt of\r\n the policy suggested; it was stated that China had not led up to\r\n a breach with Germany by notes of protest, such as had made the\r\n action of the United States seem natural and unavoidable; Germany\r\n had of late years always been considerate in her treatment of China,\r\n a sudden breach might seem treacherous; it might also be taken by\r\n Japan as so surprising an action as to give a favourable pretext for\r\n pressing the dreaded demands of Group V. It was also apparent that\r\n the representatives of the European Allies were not in a position to\r\n give China, at the present time, any advice favourable to the action\r\n suggested.\r\n\r\n I pointed out in turn that were the action suggested once taken by\r\n China, the representatives of the Allied Powers would have no choice\r\n but to applaud it, which some of them, at least, would do from the\r\n fulness of their hearts. As far as Japan was concerned, the situation\r\n would be such as to indicate that that country, too, would decide\r\n to express approval of the action. Having taken a definite position\r\n on this side of the controversy, without yet entirely associating\r\n herself with the Allies, China would be in a position to command their\r\n goodwill; any interference with China's sovereign rights would be\r\n rendered more difficult because of the situation thus created. It was\r\n almost inconceivable that coercive action should be taken against the\r\n friend who had declared himself. Moreover, the United States having\r\n taken the initiative in inviting China to participate in the protest,\r\n it would be unlikely that any action could be taken over the head of\r\n the United States or without consulting the American Government.\r\n\r\n As to the suddenness of the action suggested, I urged that the\r\n action of the German Government in announcing unrestricted submarine\r\n warfare was itself so astounding in its disregard of neutral rights\r\n that no action taken in reply could be considered too drastic. It\r\n was virtually a threat to kill Chinese citizens navigating certain\r\n portions of the high seas; and injury could be prevented only by\r\n taking a determined and forceful position.\r\n\r\nWe continued our discussion until nearly twelve o'clock, when I took\r\nmy leave, thanking the ministers for their courtesy and goodwill. The\r\ncabinet sat until six in the evening. Shortly after six I received a\r\ntelephone call from Mr. C.C. Wu, who said: \"I am very happy to tell\r\nyou that the cabinet has decided to make a protest to Germany, and\r\nto indicate that diplomatic relations will be broken off unless the\r\npresent submarine warfare is abandoned.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to remember, as the publication of the Russian secret\r\narchives has shown, that on this very day the Japanese Minister for\r\nForeign 'Affairs was urging the Russian ambassador at Tokyo to get from\r\nhis government assurances of various benefits (including Shantung)\r\nto come to Japan if she undertook the supposedly difficult task of\r\ninducing China to join the Allies. Japan was thus asking a commission\r\nfor persuading the Chinese to join the Allies, although they were\r\nwilling to do so freely of their own accord, as their action this day\r\nshowed.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese had made a great decision. These men had acted\r\nindependently upon their judgment of what was just and in the best\r\ninterests of their own nation. It was the act of a free government,\r\nwithout a shadow of attempt at pressure, without a thought of exacting\r\ncompensations on their part. When it is considered in comparison with\r\nthe manner in which some other governments entered the war, it will\r\nstand as an honour to China for all time. Incidentally, this was\r\nChina's first independent participation in world politics. She had\r\nstepped out of her age-long aloofness and taken her place among the\r\nmodern nations.\r\n\r\nI now sent the note to the Chinese Government which contained the\r\nsimple assurance of fair treatment by the United States. In return I\r\nreceived this promise:\r\n\r\n In case an act should be performed by the German Government which\r\n should be considered by the American Government as a sufficient cause\r\n for a declaration of war, the Chinese Government will at least break\r\n off its diplomatic relations with Germany.\r\n\r\nIn his formal note to me, dated February 9th, the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs declared:\r\n\r\n The Chinese Government being in accord with the principles set forth\r\n in Your Excellency's note and firmly associating itself with the\r\n Government of the United States of America, has taken similar action\r\n by protesting energetically to the German Government against the\r\n new measures of blockade. The Chinese Government also proposes to\r\n take such action in the future as will be deemed necessary for the\r\n maintenance of the principles of international law.\r\n\r\nOn the same day a formal note of protest was dispatched to the German\r\nminister.\r\n\r\nThe entire cabinet reported on February 10th to a secret session of\r\nparliament on the diplomatic action it had taken. The report was well\r\nreceived; only a few questions were asked concerning the procedure\r\nwhich had been followed. Parliament did not take a vote on this matter,\r\nas it was considered to be an action by the cabinet within the range of\r\nits legal functions.\r\n\r\nA wave of exultation passed over the country. There seemed to be\r\nhope for harmony among factions; the self-respect of the Government\r\nwas visibly heightened. That China had without coercion or sordid\r\ninducement taken a definite stand on so momentous a matter inspired the\r\nChinese with new hope. In coming to the support of international right,\r\nthey felt that they were strengthening the forces which make for the\r\nindependence of their own country.\r\n\r\nExpressing themselves unofficially the representatives of the Allied\r\ngovernments during these negotiations cautiously favoured the step\r\nproposed. When the decision had once been taken, the approval of the\r\nChinese action was unanimous. My Belgian colleague remarked to me:\r\n\"The air has been cleared, a weight has been lifted off China and the\r\npowers. The stock of America has risen 100 per cent.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sam Blythe gave a dinner on the evening of February 9th, at which\r\nDr. George Morrison and many other American and British friends were\r\npresent. The dinner became a celebration. Greeting me, Doctor Morrison\r\nsaid: \"This is the greatest thing ever accomplished in China. It means\r\na new era. It will make the Chinese nationally self-conscious; and\r\nthat, not for narrow, selfish purposes, but to vindicate human rights.\"\r\n\r\nBut the thing was not yet accomplished. I knew well enough that the\r\ndecision of the Central Government would not be immediately accepted\r\nin all parts of China. Opposition might crop out. In certain regions\r\nmen of strong German sympathies were in control, or political intrigues\r\nto cause embarrassment and difficulties to the Central Government were\r\ngoing on. All China must understand and support the decision taken by\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nOf the leaders in the provinces the Vice-President, General Feng, at\r\nNanking, was most important; as the blunder had been committed of not\r\nconsulting him, he was predisposed against the decision; moreover,\r\nGeneral Feng had several German advisers in whom he placed confidence,\r\nand who had given him a strong notion of German invincibility.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Mr. Sam Blythe was going to stop at Nanking on his way to\r\nShanghai, in order as a journalist to interview the Vice-President.\r\nBlythe argued the matter out with him. He found that General Feng\r\nreally felt injured. This was smoothed over. With Mr. W.H. Donald as\r\nan able second, Sam Blythe impressed upon the General that China had\r\nmerely been asked to break off relations, which did not imply going to\r\nwar. After a long and serious conversation, with some side-flashes from\r\nSam Blythe, the Vice-President declared himself fully satisfied, and he\r\ncame out in favour of the Government's policy. (Thus, as has often been\r\nthe case, an unofficial visit by private individuals accomplished the\r\ngood results.)\r\n\r\nIn other ways and by other persons, different leaders were visited and\r\nfamiliarized with the underlying reasons for the act of the Central\r\nGovernment. These influences interplayed with cumulative effect; no\r\nconcerted opposition was formed; by a sort of football \"interference\"\r\nthe policy to condemn German submarine warfare, and, if necessary, to\r\nbreak relations with Germany, scored its touchdown.\r\n\r\nIntelligent teamwork and American energy were in a fair way to give\r\nChina the backing she needed, having first assured her concerted\r\naction with the United States. At a diplomatic dinner which I gave\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs in February, the absorbing talk was\r\nabout the diplomatic action taken by China. Count Martel and M. Pelliot\r\nof the French Legation, Miles Lampson of the British Legation, Mr.\r\nKonovalov, Russia's financial adviser for China, and other Allied\r\nrepresentatives all came to me during the evening to say how enormously\r\ngratified they were at the initiative of the United States and the\r\nstand taken by China. For once nobody could disapprove of Chinese\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese also expressed approval, but immediately tried to get\r\nChina to take the further step of declaring war, and the French\r\nminister, too, worked actively for this. Japan was eager to recover the\r\nlead. A great campaign of intrigue and counter-intrigue resulted among\r\nthe various factions in China which threatened to destroy the unifying\r\nand inspiring effects of China's action. The question of joining the\r\nAllies out and out was thrown into politics. From all this most of the\r\nministers held aloof. When Liang Chi-chao sounded me on this question,\r\nI told him, while lacking instructions from my government, that I\r\nthought the rupture of diplomatic relations would be enough, if it\r\nshould come to that. Within a few days instructions came from the State\r\nDepartment to the same effect.\r\n\r\nDuring March I repeatedly saw Vice-President Feng and President Li.\r\nFeng, small and slender, intelligent in appearance, bald, with keen but\r\nshifty eyes, was courtesy itself. I was specially delighted with the\r\nrefinement and musical quality of his diction. I went over the whole\r\nground with him, satisfying him, especially, on the question of the\r\nspecific American objections to the German U-boats. \"I approve heartily\r\nand completely,\" he finally assured me, \"of the proposed break with\r\nGermany.\"\r\n\r\nI found that General Li was not only in favour of breaking with\r\nGermany, but of an internal break with his own premier, General Tuan.\r\n\"I cannot trust him,\" said Li; \"he wishes to eliminate me from real\r\npower.\" This friction within distressed me not a little, as I had\r\nsincerely hoped that these two men would come to coöperate.\r\n\r\nThen I saw Dr. Wu Ting-fang. Besides being China's foreign minister,\r\nDoctor Wu is a spiritualist. When I entered, he followed his usual\r\nbent, bundled the morning's business details over to the counsellor\r\nin attendance, and devoted himself to philosophizing. Spiritualism,\r\nlongevity, and the advantages of a vegetarian diet, were to him topics\r\nfor real thought and speculation. In mystic language, he remarked:\r\n\"There is an aura gradually spreading from Europe over the entire\r\nsurface of the world. It enters the brains of the people and penetrates\r\nthem, making them war-mad. We are having the first signs here.\"\r\n\r\nBy March 10th, submarine warfare had not been modified. Parliament then\r\nformally approved the breach of diplomatic relations with Germany.\r\n\r\nI had almost belaboured the department for instructions during the\r\nprogress of our work. But it was not until the 13th of March, the very\r\nday the break of diplomatic relations was formally notified, that the\r\ninstructions came. These rather implied that the circular inviting\r\ncoöperation on the part of the neutral powers had been too strongly\r\nacted upon by me. I could not but be inwardly amused.\r\n\r\nWhen a government takes a step involving life and death and all the\r\ninterests of its own and of general civilization; when, in connection\r\ntherewith, it calls upon other powers to associate themselves with\r\nit--it ought to be safe to presume that the government means what\r\nit says. It should see that the action it invokes involves great\r\nsacrifices, and it must not invoke it lightly. A responsible official\r\nwould not be justified in interpreting such a note in a platonic sense.\r\n\r\nAt once questions of finance arose. Ancient China had taken her\r\nbrave step in modern world affairs. She might now have to go to war.\r\nThat would take money, and money would be needed to guard such a\r\ncontingency--indeed, internally and externally China had need to put\r\nher financial house in order. Yuan Shih-kai's imperialism had left a\r\nburden of debt. The Republic required strengthening by a new system of\r\nnational credit and by the building up of its natural resources. Now\r\nthe public debt was relatively still small, the rate of taxation upon\r\nthe hundreds of millions of citizens low. The situation was basically\r\nsound. The question had been asked since last summer: Would America\r\nsupply China with an investment loan of a hundred millions, thus\r\ndelivering her of lenders who were seeking to dominate her and to split\r\nher up into \"spheres of influence\"?\r\n\r\nMinister Wellington Koo, who had journeyed to the United States in\r\nbehalf of Yuan Shih-kai's imperial ambitions, now worked for the\r\nRepublic there. I suggested at first that the firm of Lee, Higginson\r\n& Company, which still held its option, should complete its loan.\r\nThis was not done. Then other capitalists were approached and in\r\nNovember, 1916, Doctor Koo arranged for a large loan with Mr. John J.\r\nAbbott, president of the Continental and Commercial Savings Bank of\r\nChicago. Mr. Abbott, wishing to study the Chinese financial situation,\r\narrived in Peking during April, 1917, bringing his lawyer. I got him\r\nacquainted with the Chinese ministers, and took him and Mr. Joy Morton,\r\nalso of Chicago, to lunch with President Li and Dr. Chen Chin-tao and\r\nHsu Un-yuen. The President said: \"I will back all financial legislation\r\nwhich American experts may find necessary for the proper organization\r\nof China's credit.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Chen was arrested and put in prison through the plotting of his\r\nenemies, but Hsu Un-yuen remained, with his sound financial training.\r\nFinally Mr. Abbott proposed an ingenious scheme, with the wine and\r\ntobacco taxes as the basis--for every $1,000,000 of annual revenue\r\nthere should be a loan of $5,000,000; if the taxes amounted to ten\r\nmillions, they would serve as security for a loan of fifty millions.\r\nMr. Abbott left behind him a plan for reorganizing these taxes, and a\r\npromise to take up at any time the question of loans on this basis, in\r\naddition to five millions lent the preceding November and an option for\r\ntwenty-five millions more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nCHINA'S BOSSES COME TO PEKING\r\n\r\n\r\nI have noted that Dr. Chen Chin-tao, Chinese Minister of Finance, was\r\nput in prison. Doctor Chen had administered Chinese finances strictly\r\nand well, in a most difficult period. For the military governors or\r\nTuchuns, who were the real bosses of China's vast population, he was\r\ntoo honest and too strict. The Tuchuns looked upon the Minister of\r\nFinance as in duty bound to procure funds for them by hook or crook.\r\n\r\nWhen the government banks were broken and had declared a moratorium,\r\ntheir large over-issues of notes were worth only one half their face\r\nvalue. Working with Doctor Chen was Hsu Un-yuen, managing director\r\nof the Bank of China. Mr. Hsu managed judiciously to bring the notes\r\nof his bank virtually to par. The Tuchuns, aided by the pro-Japanese\r\nclique, which formed part of the Premier's entourage, attacked both Hsu\r\nand Doctor Chen. For the latter the cabal laid a trap. It was made to\r\nappear that he gave support to a certain company in return for having\r\nhis brother employed. So the cabal, using this pretext to satisfy their\r\ngrievances, got him arrested and jailed, thus ending his negotiations\r\nwith the Chicago bank of John J. Abbott. President Li was interested\r\nand distressed. When I asked Premier Tuan about Doctor Chen, he\r\nsmilingly stated that he should have a chance to clear himself.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the breach between the Premier and the President widened.\r\nTo strengthen himself in his policy of favouring a declaration of war,\r\nthe Premier called all the Tuchuns to Peking for a conference. Nine\r\ngovernors-general came, and all the other provinces sent delegates.\r\nGeneral Tuan was successful with them, and by April 28th they had\r\ndecided to support his war policy.\r\n\r\nThe Tuchun of Shantung was bulky, coarse-looking. I had some idea of\r\nhis views on representative government from his inaugural address\r\nto the Shantung Assembly. \"Gentlemen,\" the Tuchun said with genial\r\nfrankness, \"you resemble birds who are in a large cage together. If\r\nyou behave well, and sing songs that are pleasing, we shall feed you;\r\notherwise, you shall have to go without food.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Tuchuns called on me by appointment, and later I gave\r\nthem a formal reception, at which I saw all who had come to Peking,\r\nobserved their personalities, and tried to fathom the source of their\r\npersonal prominence and power. I talked with them individually and in\r\ngroups, chiefly about the progress of the war and the relative strength\r\nof the combatants. My guests were full of smiles and good cheer,\r\nparticularly did the Tuchun of Fukien radiate joy. In their sociability\r\nthey were true Chinese, and here, where they had been received with\r\nthe military honours due to their position and in the spirit of\r\nhospitality, they could show themselves in a more amiable light than\r\nwhen maintaining their power in their provinces. To a brief speech of\r\nwelcome which I made when they had all arrived General Hsu Shu-cheng\r\nreplied with a most emphatic expression of friendship for America.\r\n\r\nThat so many of these governors should have risen from the lowliest\r\nposition was indeed strong evidence of the underlying democracy of\r\nChinese life. But that a mere handful of men should wield such power,\r\neach in his province, did not bespeak strength in representative\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nSome of the military commanders were men of education, although most of\r\nthem had risen from very modest surroundings: Yen Hsi-shan, of Shansi;\r\nChu Jui, of Chekiang; Tang Chi-yao, of Yunnan; Chen Kuang-yuan, of\r\nKiangsi; Ni Tze-chung, of Anhwei; Li Shun, of Nanking, a fisherman's\r\nson; Li Ho-chi of Fukien, Tien Chung-yu of Kalgan, both of middle-class\r\nfamilies--all these were fair scholars. General Wu Pei-fu, who rose\r\nfrom the post of a private in the Chino-Japanese War, had through great\r\nintelligence and industry acquired a good education, as likewise had\r\nGeneral Feng Yu-hsiang; both of these generals professed the Christian\r\nreligion. President Feng Kuo-chang came of a poor family, and as a\r\nyoung man played a fiddle in a small local theatre.\r\n\r\nAmong the other Tuchuns were many to whom the Chinese applied the\r\nproverb: \"A good man will never become a soldier.\" These men, indeed,\r\ndeserve credit for having risen from their original state as coolies,\r\nbandits, or horse-thieves, but they often owe their prominence to\r\nqualities which by no means make for the good of the state. Chang\r\nTso-lin, the Viceroy of Manchuria, commenced his career as a bandit; he\r\nwas pardoned by Chao Er-shun, and became a government officer. Chang\r\nHuai-chi was a coolie, and never got much education. Tsao Kun, of\r\nChihli, was a huckster. Wang Chan-yuan was a hostler. The trio, Chang\r\nHsun, Lu Yung-ting, and Mu Yung-hsing, headed the so-called Black Flag\r\nBand; at one time the partners put up fifty thousand taels to enable\r\nChang Hsun to buy himself an office and become respectable. But he\r\nspent it all in high living. With the antecedents of some of these men\r\none marvels not only at the position they have acquired, but at the\r\npersonal polish and air of refinement of many of them.\r\n\r\nAll of them dealt with political power as a commodity, secured\r\nthrough the use of money and soldiers. They were somewhat like the\r\n_condottieri_ of the Italian renaissance, looking ahead only to the\r\ngoal of their personal ambition for wealth and power. Even among these\r\nmilitarists, however, there were those who gave some attention to\r\nmatters of public policy, and the idea of national welfare and unity\r\nhad begun to dawn upon their consciousness. Moreover, in them I felt\r\na mixture of the old and the new. They had suddenly come into great\r\npower, thought in terms of airplanes and modern armaments, but had as\r\nyet few other modern ideas to inspire their action with anything beyond\r\npersonal motives. In their human qualities, however, several of them\r\nexcelled; and some, even, showed a real spirit of public service and\r\nability as administrators.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government was still trying to get China into the war,\r\nand its minister called on President Li to urge it. I talked on May\r\n9th with the President, who said that he favoured a declaration of war\r\nprovided parliament was not overridden in the process. Then I saw the\r\nPremier. \"If parliament is obstinate,\" General Tuan said bluntly, \"it\r\nwill be dissolved.\"\r\n\r\nI told him it would make a very bad impression in the United States and\r\nwith other Western powers if parliament were ignored in so important\r\na matter. I knew that parliament did not oppose declaring war, but\r\ndesired to control the war policy. \"But,\" the Premier urged, \"the\r\nopposition of parliament disregards national interests. It desires\r\nmerely to secure partisan advantage.\" Tuan discussed the attitude of\r\nJapan. \"The Japanese have assured me,\" he declared, \"that if I follow a\r\nstrong policy I may count on their support. Now circumstances force the\r\nChinese Government to be friendly to Japan. Of course, I will not give\r\nup any valuable rights to anybody, and I will strengthen China in every\r\nway so that resistance may be offered to any attempted injustice.\"\r\n\r\nIronically, he asked whether confidence could be placed in the southern\r\nleaders of the Kuo Min Tang. \"I have proof,\" he continued, \"that both\r\nSun Yat-sen and Tsen Liang-kuang have given written assurances to the\r\nJapanese Consul-General at Shanghai that if either of them becomes\r\nPresident of China he will conclude a treaty granting to Japan rights\r\nof supervision of military and administrative affairs more extensive\r\nthan those sought in Group V of the twenty-one demands.\" So each party\r\nbelieved the worst of the other.\r\n\r\nEvents were tending to a climax. The Government was demoralized. Doctor\r\nChen was in prison; Mr. Li Ching-hsi, a nephew of Li Hung-chang,\r\nwho was to take Chen's place, would not assume office while affairs\r\nremained so unsettled. The Ministry of Communications was in charge of\r\nan underling. The Minister of Education, who also acted as Minister of\r\nthe Interior, was seriously ill. The Kuo Min Tang ministers had lost\r\ntheir influence with their party in parliament because of their failure\r\neffectively to oppose the Tuchuns' policy. It was believed that the\r\nTuchuns, with the followers of General Tuan, were planning a _coup_\r\nagainst Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this I had a personal chat with Chen Lu, the\r\nVice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, at an evening reception at the\r\nBritish Legation. I told him of my surprise that the Tuchuns, instead\r\nof attending to the urgent business in their provinces, should be\r\ngathered here, interfering with the Central Government. I let it be\r\ndistinctly understood that any movement to overthrow parliament in\r\norder to carry out the war policy could not be expected to receive the\r\nsympathy of the United States. The vice-minister was in close touch\r\nwith the Tuchuns. I expected that he would repeat my remarks to them.\r\nHe did.\r\n\r\nAs I was leaving the Chancery a few evenings later Mr. Roy Anderson\r\nappeared with the news that something was happening and drove me over\r\nto the railway station. We went through the Chenmen gate. Along the\r\nmain street were many carts rapidly driven, loaded with military stores\r\nand household goods. Automobiles were rushing by them to the station.\r\nOn the platform was a turmoil of troops busily transferring the various\r\nmilitary possessions to cars. In a parlour car our friends the Tuchuns\r\nwere assembling. I left Mr. Anderson there to observe and to get\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that the Tuchuns had all of a sudden decided to leave\r\nPeking for their various capitals, taking their bodyguards with them.\r\nTwo or three were to remain in Tientsin a little longer to watch\r\ndevelopments. Their precipitous exit seemed to indicate that President\r\nLi had at last got the upper hand.\r\n\r\nAs a farewell courtesy to Doctor Willoughby, the American legal\r\nadviser, the President had invited him and me to luncheon on the\r\nfollowing day. President Li was cheerful. The discomfiture of the\r\nTuchuns filled him with glee. \"All danger is passed,\" he announced; \"I\r\nwill dismiss General Tuan, appoint a new cabinet, and have parliament\r\ndecide the war question without compulsion.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to inform myself as to what was behind the President's\r\nconfidence, I asked him what he had to put in the place of his cabinet\r\nand General Tuan, and whether he believed that the Government could be\r\ncarried on without the concurrence of that important party.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" the President assured me, \"it is all arranged.\"\r\n\r\nPressing him a little further, and asking upon whom, in particular, he\r\nwas relying, to my unspeakable surprise, he said: \"General Chang Hsun\r\nwill assist me.\"\r\n\r\nNow General Chang Hsun was an old-time bandit and militarist. His ideas\r\nwere devoid of any understanding of representative institutions. It\r\npassed my power of imagination to see how reliance could be placed in\r\nthis general for the vindication of parliament. As I looked dubious,\r\nthe President repeated: \"Yes, you may believe me. I can rely on General\r\nChang Hsun.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not what Chang Hsun stood for that the President relied on, but\r\non his enmity to General Tuan. Li Yuan-hung, though quite modern in his\r\nconception of government, in this instance followed a strong Chinese\r\ninstinct which aims to prevail by setting off strong individuals\r\nagainst each other.\r\n\r\nAfter I had heard that the dismissal of General Tuan had been\r\nannounced, General Chin Yun-peng called on me. He was agitated and much\r\nworried. \"Do you not think that General Tuan should leave Peking?\" he\r\nasked. \"His enemies will undoubtedly wish to take his life.\"\r\n\r\nI tried to cheer him up by telling him that in a modern government\r\nsuch ups and downs must be expected. \"Let the other side now develop\r\ntheir policy, and show what they can do; let General Tuan use this time\r\nfor quiet recuperation, after the strain he has been through. Then,\"\r\nI said, \"the time will come again when Tuan will be called back to\r\npower.\" The eyes of the good general lit up with gratitude. General Ni\r\nTze-chung, most notorious and active among the military party, declared\r\non the 26th of May that the dismissal of General Tuan had been illegal.\r\nHis province of Anhwei disapproved; it would act independently of the\r\nCentral Government.\r\n\r\nThis was the crucial point in the development of the situation.\r\n\r\nExpert observers said that had the President immediately dismissed\r\nNi and ordered his punishment, appointing a junior commander in his\r\nplace, the rest of the militarists would have fallen away from Ni, and\r\nthe President could have dealt with them individually. Instead, he was\r\npersuaded to send a conciliatory letter to General Ni.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, confirmed the leadership of Ni over the military\r\nparty; further, it encouraged the majority of the Tuchuns to declare\r\ntheir independence.\r\n\r\nA so-called provisional government was set up at Tientsin. The older\r\nand wiser heads of the military party, men like General Tuan Chi-jui\r\nand Mr. Hsu Shih-chang, held themselves entirely aloof from this new\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ni Tze-chung was the leading spirit. By dint of force the\r\nso-called government helped itself to the deposits of the Chinese\r\nGovernment in the Tientsin branch of the Bank of China. The men greatly\r\nin evidence were the members of the pro-Japanese clique, Mr. Tsao\r\nJu-lin and General Hsu Shu-cheng. General Aoki, the Japanese military\r\nadviser to the Government, was also on the ground.\r\n\r\nIn Peking a paralysis crept over the Government. The President lost his\r\nadvantage as quickly as he had gained it. On the railways all orders\r\nof the Tuchuns for transportation were implicitly obeyed. When at this\r\ntime the question of the movement of revolutionary troops and their\r\nstationing at Tientsin and along the railway came up, the Japanese\r\nminister persisted in the position that it would be highly undesirable\r\nto make any objection on the ground of any possible conflict with the\r\nprotection of the railway by foreign troops. Two months before, the\r\nJapanese Legation had strongly objected to the stationing of a few\r\ngovernment troops along the same railway.\r\n\r\nThe President issued a mandate inviting Chang Hsun to Peking as\r\narbitrator.\r\n\r\nWhen I interviewed the President, he looked disconsolate His youthful\r\nEnglish secretary, Mr. Kuo, tried his best to give a more cheerful\r\nand confident note to Li's conversation, but Doctor Tenney, who was\r\nwith me, easily compared the President's doleful Chinese with the more\r\nbuoyant English translation.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Tuchuns was directed toward isolating and strangling\r\nPeking. They controlled the railways leading there, and were preventing\r\nthe shipment of foodstuffs. The ministry that controlled the railways,\r\nit must be remembered, was controlled by Japanese influence.\r\nConstitutional government in China was paralyzed through the lack of\r\nmilitary and financial authority.\r\n\r\nThe war issue worried the Chinese. First, they feared that the\r\nmilitarist party would take advantage of it, through the support of\r\nJapanese influence, to fasten its hold upon China; second, that China\r\nmight by the Allies be made a field in which to seek compensations.\r\nBut if local political troubles had not entirely upset the situation,\r\nit might have been possible to arrange for a joint declaration of the\r\npowers that would have allayed suspicion and made it feasible for China\r\nto enter the war with a sense of security.\r\n\r\nDr. Wu Ting-fang, acting on the suggestion of Mr. Lenox Simpson and\r\nliberal-minded Chinese publicists, made a move to have the American\r\nGovernment do something. He sent advices to Minister Koo in Washington\r\ntelling him about General Ni and his leadership of the revolt of the\r\nTuchuns. The southern provinces were still loyal to the President and\r\nparliament, and the civil and commercial population disapproved of the\r\nrebellion. President Wilson and Secretary Lansing were asked to make\r\na statement in behalf of representative government in China. This was\r\nfollowed by a direct appeal to President Wilson.\r\n\r\nBut the American Government had already instructed me on the 5th of\r\nJune to communicate to the Chinese Government a statement evincing\r\na sincere desire for internal political harmony. The question of\r\nChina's entry into the war, it said, was secondary to continuing the\r\npolitical unity of China and the laying aside of factional disputes. I\r\naccompanied it orally with a personal statement that the United States\r\nconceived the war to be one for the principles of democracy; that it\r\nwould deplore any construction of its invitation which would lend\r\nitself to the idea that it contemplated any coercion or restriction\r\nupon Chinese freedom of action. I made plain that no matter how much\r\nthe United States wished the coöperation of China in the war, it did\r\nnot desire to bring this about by using the political dissensions or\r\nworking with any one faction in disregard of parliament.\r\n\r\nGeneral Tuan Chi-jui at once stated to Doctor Ferguson, who\r\nunofficially informed him of the American note at Tientsin, that he\r\nhad totally withdrawn from all politics. The Chinese press gave a very\r\nfavourable reception to the note; the Chinese people welcomed America's\r\nadvice. General Feng Kuo-chang, later when he had become President,\r\nspoke of the note to me, and remarked on the salutary influence it had\r\nwielded upon public opinion in China.\r\n\r\nWhile the political dissensions in the Chinese state were too\r\npersonal to be overcome by any friendly suggestions from the outside,\r\nnevertheless the American note had set up a standard for all the\r\nChinese. It had, furthermore, given convincing proof of the fact\r\nthat the true interests of China were impartially weighed by the\r\nAmerican Government, and were not entirely subordinated to any war\r\npolicy which America might desire to advance. From all parts of China\r\ncame expressions of gratitude and satisfaction that the American\r\nGovernment should have spoken to China so justly and truly. The Chinese\r\nappreciated the spirit of justice of the American Government in not\r\ndesiring to have the war issue used for the purposes of enabling any\r\nfaction or party to override the free determination of the Chinese\r\nGovernment and people. As America was itself at war and would therefore\r\nhave welcomed coöperation, this just policy particularly impressed the\r\nChinese.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese press both in Japan and China immediately launched forth\r\ninto a bitter invective against the American action. The United States\r\nshould have consulted Japan. Its action constituted interference in the\r\ndomestic affairs of China. \"If China listens to advice from America,\"\r\na Japanese major-general declared in an excited speech at a dinner in\r\nPeking on the 7th of June, \"she will have Japan to deal with.\"\r\n\r\nThe Japanese ambassador at Washington protested informally. Had not\r\nSecretary Bryan, in a note dated the 13th of March, 1915, recognized\r\nthe special and close relations, political and economic, between Japan\r\nand China? It was impossible that the American minister at Peking was\r\ntaking a part in political affairs in China, but the Japanese public\r\nwas sensitive about the note sent by the American Government to China.\r\nWould it not be useful if the American Government would confirm Mr.\r\nBryan's statement?\r\n\r\nThe reply to this communication did not come until the 6th of July.\r\nMr. Bryan's statement, the reply said, referred only to the special\r\nrelations created by territorial contiguity in certain parts of China.\r\nEven with respect to them it in no way admitted that the United States\r\nmight not in future be justified in expressing itself relative to\r\nquestions that might arise between China and Japan. The United States\r\ncould not be indifferent to matters affecting the welfare of the\r\nChinese people, such as the unrest in China.\r\n\r\nThe first detachments of Chang Hsun's troops arrived in Peking on\r\nthe 9th of June. Chang Hsun's theory was that it is the business of\r\na trooper to make himself terrible. These wild horsemen, wearing\r\nloose-fitting black uniforms, with their cues rolled up on the back of\r\nthe head, rode about Peking with the air of conquerors. The \"Mediator\"\r\nwas coming with sufficient military force to back his judgment.\r\n\r\nWhen General Chang himself arrived, the streets from the railway\r\nstation to the Mediator's house in the Manchu city were entirely shut\r\noff. Mounted troopers blocked the way as my automobile came along a\r\nside street to cross one of these thoroughfares. They nearly collided\r\nwith the front of my machine, drew their guns, and would not budge. To\r\nexplain to them my right to pass would have meant sending someone to\r\nthe Foreign Office; even then in order to go on I might have to run\r\nover them, for the Foreign Office, undoubtedly, meant nothing at all to\r\nthem. I told my companion not to let them know my position. We tried to\r\npass through on the ground that we had business on the other side, but\r\nthey reared their horses up and down, and nearly came into the machine\r\nwith us. We were held up until the great man had arrived and had raced\r\nfrom the station to his residence.\r\n\r\nWhen I was with Dr. Wu Ting-fang a few days later the card of a\r\nsecretary of the cabinet was brought in. I knew that he was trying to\r\ninduce Doctor Wu to sign a decree dissolving parliament. I had heard in\r\nthe morning that President Li had finally caved in; for Chang Hsun's\r\nfirst prescription for restoring China was to declare that parliament\r\nmust be dissolved. The President relied on Chang's assistance. He\r\ncould not help himself, he must accept the dictation of the man he had\r\nsummoned.\r\n\r\nI rejoined a friend who awaited me outside in the automobile. He had\r\njust overheard the chauffeur of the cabinet secretary and the doorman\r\nof the Foreign Office. The chauffeur had said: \"Is your old man going\r\nto sign up? You had better see to it that he does, else something might\r\nhappen to him.\"\r\n\r\nThese subordinates were keeping their eyes open.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese minister, on whom I called that morning, said to me:\r\n\"General Chang's mediation is the last hope of peace. It is desirable\r\nthat parliament be gotten rid of, it is obstructive, and makes the\r\ndoing of business well-nigh impossible.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Wu Ting-fang stood out against countersigning the mandate\r\nthat would dissolve the parliament. In matters of spiritualism,\r\nvegetarianism, and longevity, I had perhaps not always been able to\r\ntake him quite seriously. But I admired his quiet courage in not\r\nallowing himself to be bowled over, after even President Li had given\r\nin. Before daylight on the 13th of June Doctor Wu was roused from his\r\nbed and now asked to countersign a Presidential mandate designating the\r\njovial General Chiang Chao-tsung, commander of the Peking gendarmerie,\r\nto act as Premier, and accepting Doctor Wu's resignation. Before\r\ndaybreak General Chiang signed the mandate dissolving parliament. The\r\nPresident consented to its issue, for he had been told it would be\r\nimpossible to prevent disturbances in Peking unless this were done.\r\n\r\nSo wore on the early summer of 1917. Affairs seemed to have arrived at\r\na stalemate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nAN EMPEROR FOR A DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nMy family had gone to Peitaiho for the summer. I was staying at the\r\nresidence alone with Mr. F.L. Belin, who had recently come to Peking to\r\njoin my staff. I slept rather late on Sunday, July 1st, as the morning\r\nwas cool. When Kao, the first boy, came in to take orders he appeared\r\nexcited and cried: \"Emperor has come back again!\"\r\n\r\nI did not immediately grasp the significance of this astonishing\r\nannouncement; but he went on volubly telling me that it was true, that\r\nthe Emperor had returned, that all the people were hanging out the\r\nyellow dragon flag. I sent out for information and soon learned that\r\nthe little emperor, in some mysterious way, had been restored during\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nThe monarchical movement came as a complete surprise to everybody,\r\nfor it was entirely the personal act of General Chang Hsun. The men\r\nwhose names were recited in his proclamations as assisting him had\r\nknown nothing about it; it was undreamed of even by those who found\r\nthemselves forced to assist, such as the Chief of Staff and the heads\r\nof the gendarmerie and of the police.\r\n\r\nKang Yu-wei, the \"Modern Sage\" of China, arrived in Peking on June\r\n29th, and with him the restoration was planned. Kang Yu-wei, who had\r\nbeen the leader of the first reform movement in 1898, when he made a\r\nstand against absolutism, had always remained a consistent believer in\r\nconstitutional monarchy. He encouraged Chang Hsun with philosophical\r\ntheory, and wrote all his edicts for him. The two believed that the\r\nImperial restoration would immediately bring to the active support of\r\nthe Government all the military governors, whose true sentiments were\r\nnotoriously imperialistic. Their consent was taken for granted, and the\r\nedicts, as drawn up, expressly assumed that it had been given.\r\n\r\nIt became known to me that Chang Hsun had also discussed the\r\npossibility of an Imperial restoration with the Japanese minister. The\r\nlatter expressed the opinion that the movement should not be undertaken\r\nwithout first making sure of the assent of the chief military leaders.\r\nChang Hsun had no doubt of this support; he evidently regarded the\r\nadvice of the Japanese minister as encouraging, and believed that his\r\nmovement would have diplomatic countenance.\r\n\r\nChang Hsun had his intimate advisers, particularly Kang Yu-wei, draw\r\nup the requisite Imperial edicts on the 30th of June. In these it was\r\nstated that leading governors, like Feng Kuo-chang, Lu Yung-ting, and\r\nothers of equal prominence, had petitioned for the restoration of the\r\nmonarchy. Lists of appointments to the highest positions in the Central\r\nGovernment and the provinces were prepared. The existing military\r\ngovernors were in most cases reappointed. In the Central Government\r\nthe important men designated were Hsu Shih-chang as Guardian of the\r\nEmperor, Liang Tun-yen as Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Chu Chi-pao\r\nas Minister of the Interior. Wang Shih-chen was retained as Chief of\r\nthe General Staff.\r\n\r\nAs an amazing instance of how consent was taken for granted, it was\r\nrecited in an Imperial edict that President Li Yuan-hung had himself\r\npetitioned for the reëstablishment of the Empire; this edict appointed\r\nLi a duke of the first class.\r\n\r\nSo soon as these edicts were prepared and ready for presentation, a\r\ndinner was arranged for the evening of the same day, to which the heads\r\nof the Peking military and police establishments were invited. They\r\nmet at the Kiangsu Guild Hall. After great quantities of wine had been\r\nconsumed, Chang Hsun broached his project for the salvation of China,\r\nstating that all preparations had been made and that military and\r\ndiplomatic support was assured. Then, pointing to the Chief of Staff,\r\nhe said: \"Of course, you are supporting the movement.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Wang, completely taken aback, saw no way to refuse--since\r\nhe was in the presence of an accomplished fact. In the same way the\r\nconsent of General Chiang, head of the gendarmerie, and of General Wu,\r\nhead of the police, was obtained.\r\n\r\nThus the enterprise was launched. Chang Hsun directed General Wang and\r\nfour others to proceed immediately to the residence of President Li,\r\nto wake him up, and to obtain his consent to a memorial asking for\r\nreëstablishment of the monarchy. Chang Hsun himself proceeded to the\r\nImperial City. Not being able to obtain the support of the Imperial\r\ndukes for his movement, he had lavishly bribed the eunuchs in charge of\r\nthe palace, who opened the gates for him and his retinue, and took him\r\nto the private residence of the young Emperor. Chang Hsun prostrated\r\nhimself, and informed the Emperor that the whole nation demanded his\r\nreturn to the throne. Thereupon he took the frightened boy to the great\r\nthrone room, and, in the presence of his retainers and members of the\r\nImperial Family, who had been summoned, formally enthroned the Emperor.\r\nThen the edicts which had been prepared were formally sealed.\r\n\r\nAs may be imagined, there were some comic incidents. A rather\r\ndistinguished man had been summoned by the Premier to discuss with the\r\nPresident his assumption of one of the cabinet portfolios. A Chinese\r\nfriend of mine who had just heard of the restoration saw him at the\r\nhotel about ten o'clock in the morning. On being asked what was his\r\nerrand in Peking, the distinguished personage stated confidentially\r\nthat he was awaiting a carriage to take him to the President's palace.\r\n\"There is no President,\" he was told. \"This is now an Empire; the\r\nEmperor was enthroned at four o'clock this morning.\" The great man's\r\nastonishment was amusing.\r\n\r\nAs the military chiefs were deceived on the preceding night, so Peking\r\nwas deceived for one day. As the news spread, the population showed an\r\nalmost joyous excitement. Everywhere the yellow dragon flags appeared,\r\nsoon the entire city took on a festive appearance. Revived memories\r\nof past splendour seemingly made the population of Peking imperialist\r\nto a man. But the height of this movement was reached as early as the\r\nmorning of the 2nd of July.\r\n\r\nI had avoided receiving General Chang Hsun. Mr. Liang Tung-yen came to\r\nassume office as Minister for Foreign Affairs; I also abstained from\r\nseeing him, as well as the rest of General Chang's ministers, asking\r\nDoctor Tenney to talk with those who presented themselves. Mr. Liang\r\nhad always been an imperialist, and was in high spirits, believing that\r\nat last China was saved. He had been led to believe that the foreign\r\ndiplomats would readily recognize the restoration.\r\n\r\nStrong doubts as to the character of the movement became manifest on\r\nMonday, the 2nd of July. Tuan Chi-jui did not figure in the Imperial\r\nofficial lists. When asked about this, Chang Hsun declared that\r\nGeneral Tuan was unimportant, having no troops under his command. But\r\nLiang Chi-chao had been playing cards with friends at about 2 A.M. on\r\nthe fateful night, when the news was telephoned to Tientsin. Liang\r\nimmediately went to General Tuan's residence, where the latter was\r\nsimilarly engaged at cards. General Tuan, who was thoroughly weary of\r\npublic affairs, was difficult to rouse; he begged to be spared the\r\ntrouble of thinking of what might be occurring in Peking. More details\r\ncame in, and it became apparent what a thoroughly one-man affair the\r\nmovement was. Then Tuan roused himself.\r\n\r\nTuan was at that time actually only a private citizen, without\r\nauthority or command. But I learned later that Liang Chi-chao had gone\r\nto Japanese friends for funds to enlist the military against the\r\nImperial movement, and he got 1,000,000 yen as a loan to himself and\r\nGeneral Tuan for this purpose. It was to be treated as a government\r\nloan upon restoration of normal conditions.\r\n\r\nThe two proceeded on Tuesday to Machang, where the Eighth Division had\r\nbeen encamped since the attempt to overawe President Li Yuan-hung.\r\nGeneral Tuan, it was stated, felt nervous as to the outcome of his\r\nventure, but he called the commanders, declaring that he had always\r\nbeen opposed to a restoration of the monarchy, and that it was now\r\nbeing attempted by a single general. To resist this act he proposed to\r\ntake command of the republican troops.\r\n\r\nGeneral Tuan was at once recognized as commander-in-chief. President\r\nLi, on his part, did not yield to the importunities of Chang Hsun.\r\nHe gave out an absolute denial of the statement that he favoured the\r\nrestoration. After issuing a mandate that turned over the Presidential\r\npowers to the Vice-President and appointed General Tuan Chi-jui Premier\r\nand Commander-in-Chief, he took refuge in the Legation Quarter. I sent\r\na personal representative to General Tuan at Tientsin, who declared\r\nthat he already had complete control of the military situation and\r\ncould finish Chang Hsun inside of ten days.\r\n\r\nAs hostilities threatened in and around Peking, and as the danger of\r\nlooting was always present, I discussed the precautions to be taken\r\nwith several of my colleagues, and agreed with the Japanese minister\r\nthat we would each bring a company of reinforcements from Tientsin.\r\nMeanwhile, the movements of Tuan's troops began. To hinder their\r\nadvance, Chang Hsun's men broke the railway at a point about one third\r\nof the way from Peking to Tientsin.\r\n\r\nCertain members of the diplomatic corps urged that we give notice that\r\nno fighting should take place on or near the railways. As we had made\r\nno objection to the bringing in of Chang Hsun's troops and to their\r\nbeing stationed in Peking and along the railway, I took the position\r\nthat we were not justified in objecting to the troops of the government\r\nto which we were accredited taking necessary action against Chang Hsun.\r\nWe might, however, insist upon the right of keeping the railway open.\r\nThis met with approval. On the 5th of July a demand was made upon the\r\nbelligerent generals that the railway must be kept open, and that at\r\nleast one train be allowed to pass in each direction every day.\r\n\r\nThe damaged line was reconstructed, and on July 6th, the American\r\ninfantry arrived in Peking; on the 7th, the first trains travelled\r\nbetween Peking and Tientsin--one train actually passing between the\r\narmies during a battle. Fighting went on during these days between the\r\ntroops of General Tuan, directly commanded by General Tuan Chi-kwei,\r\nand Chang Hsun's forces; there was much firing but small loss of life,\r\nand the latter's forces were finally driven back toward Peking. The\r\ntroops of General Tsao Kun also advanced upon Peking from the west.\r\n\r\nMr. Grant, of the National Printing Bureau, on Friday rushed into the\r\nlegation compound in his automobile, with the report that looting\r\nwas going on in the southern part of the city. We ascended the wall.\r\nFrom the Chenmen Tower we saw excited groups moving up and down the\r\nmain streets, but nothing was happening save the bringing in of a few\r\nwounded men. To investigate the cause of the excitement I went with\r\nMr. Belin in our private rickshaws to the Chinese city, passing to the\r\nend of the broad Chenmen thoroughfare. The street was still crowded,\r\nthe people were excited though well behaved; the shops all had their\r\nshutters up. Near the south end of the street some shopkeepers posted\r\nin front of their shops told us that the return of Chang Hsun's troops\r\nfrom outside the walls had been reported. Looting had been expected but\r\nhad not taken place. We proceeded to the Temple of Heaven, where great\r\ncrowds were walking about among the tents of the troops. On returning,\r\nwe entered a shop to look at some antiques, remaining half an hour.\r\nWhen we came out our rickshaws had disappeared. Doctor Ferguson joined\r\nus as we searched for our men. Suddenly, Belin shouted to a rickshaw\r\nman, who with a dozen others was conveying some of Chang Hsun's petty\r\nofficers southward. We insisted that the non-commissioned officer\r\noccupying the rickshaw get out, and he finally complied.\r\n\r\nThe rickshaws had been requisitioned by these bandits. Upon our\r\nreturn to the Legation, my rickshaw-runner had just arrived, excited\r\nto the point of tears. Our two coolies had drawn the men who\r\noriginally commandeered them up to the Imperial City; there they were\r\nrequisitioned again to convey other men back to the Temple of Heaven.\r\nBut my man, when opposite the entrance to Legation Street, had upset\r\nhis bandit into the road and made a quick entry into the Legation\r\nQuarter, where the angry and sputtering trooper dared not follow him.\r\nThat the rickshaws belonging to foreigners should thus be pressed into\r\nservice shows the disregard which these troopers had for everything but\r\ntheir own desires.\r\n\r\nAs we returned to the Legation we noticed a wonderful colour effect.\r\nCoal-black clouds were banked against the western sky, above which were\r\nlighter clouds or angry shreds of flaming colour. Against this the dark\r\nwalls and towers of Peking stood out in sharp relief. In the streets\r\nthe crowds still surged, in restless expectancy. Suddenly the sunset\r\nlight disappeared; the sky became black with clouds; a sharp gust of\r\nwind whirled the dust of the Chinese city northward; then came a flash\r\nof lightning, a clap of thunder, and a heavy downpour, which cooled the\r\nexcited heads and drove all to shelter. The late afternoon had been\r\nweird and fantastic, and appeared to presage the happening of still\r\nstranger things.\r\n\r\nI was lunching with a friend at his race-course house on Sunday, the\r\n8th of July, when word was brought to me that a certain Colonel Hu,\r\ncoming from Chang Hsun, had persuaded the French minister that the city\r\nwas in imminent danger of sacking, fighting, and general disturbances.\r\nThe only salvation, Colonel Hu had said, lay in asking Hsu Shi-chang to\r\ncome from Tientsin to mediate. The French minister thereupon induced\r\nhis Entente colleagues to agree to transmit a note to General Tuan\r\nChi-jui urging him to prevail upon Hsu Chi-Chang to come as mediator.\r\nThis seemed to me ill-advised. It meant, at a time when Chang Hsun\r\nwas already as good as defeated, that he would be solemnly treated as\r\nentitled to dictate the terms and personnel of mediation by influential\r\nmembers of the diplomatic corps. I returned to Peking and saw my\r\ncolleagues, urging my opinion strongly. The British chargé withdrew his\r\nconsent; he had just received a telegram from his consul in Tientsin\r\nreporting that General Tuan was absolutely opposed to mediation. The\r\naction contemplated was not taken, though Chang Hsun persisted in his\r\nattempts to gain recognition from the diplomatic corps. The French\r\nminister, who hated Dr. Wu Ting-fang--this would explain his support\r\nof Chang Hsun--gradually came to see the obverse side of his policy as\r\ncertain Germanic affiliations of Chang Hsun became known.\r\n\r\nKang Yu-wei presented himself at my house on the 8th, seeking refuge,\r\nand I assigned him rooms in one of our compounds. He informed me that\r\nChang Hsun had had full assurances of support on the part of Hsu\r\nChi-Chang and other important monarchists. Next day he informed me that\r\nPrince Tsai Tze was anxious to consult me.\r\n\r\nI arranged to have the Prince come to the house assigned to Mr. Kang,\r\nwhere I had two hours' conversation with the Manchu and the sage.\r\nKang Yu-wei commenced with a long disquisition on the advantages of a\r\nconstitutional monarchy. He wished to explain his action and to prove\r\nto me that he was not a reactionary, but was aiming only for progress\r\nunder the monarchical form, which he considered most suitable to China.\r\n\r\nAll this time the Prince was silent. He seemed greatly depressed, not\r\ninclined to say anything at first. After inquiries about his health, I\r\nasked him what he would like to say to me. With eyes of real sadness\r\nhe looked me full in the face, saying: \"What shall we do? My house has\r\nbeen drawn into this affair without our consent. It has been forced on\r\nus. We did not wish to depart from the agreements we had made with the\r\nRepublic. But Chang Hsun would not listen to us. He thought he saw the\r\nonly way. Now what shall we do?\"\r\n\r\nI told him that I appreciated the difficulty in which the Imperial\r\nFamily found itself, but that I of course could not know the details\r\nof the situation sufficiently to give any opinion. One thing, however,\r\nseemed to me certain: if the leaders of the republican government knew\r\nthe true attitude of the Imperial Family, and if the Emperor would\r\nformally and absolutely dissociate himself from the movement of Chang\r\nHsun, I believed that they would not make the Imperial Family suffer.\r\nI asked him whether they had considered having the Emperor issue a\r\ndecree, absolutely and for all time renouncing all rights to the throne\r\nand declaring his complete fealty to the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe Prince regarded me aghast. \"Oh, _no_! No matter how desirable\r\nthat might be from many points of view, it is not in the power of the\r\nEmperor to do it. The rights he has inherited are not his. They came\r\nto him in trust from his ancestors. He will have to maintain them, and\r\nhand them on to his descendants. He, and we of his family, shall not\r\ndo anything to make these rights prevail against the State, but as the\r\nsons of our ancestors, we cannot repudiate them.\"\r\n\r\nNever had I been so deeply impressed with the complexity of Chinese\r\naffairs as by this answer--an Imperial family maintaining traditions\r\nof empire in the midst of a republic, an emperor continuing to reside\r\nin the Imperial Palace, a neighbour of the republican President in his\r\nresidence, and yet no desire to enter again into politics and to grasp\r\nthe sovereign power! I could now understand why the Chinese had allowed\r\nthe Emperor to remain in the palace; it was the house of his ancestors,\r\nfrom which he might not be driven. That common reverence was the one\r\npoint of understanding between Chinese and Manchus.\r\n\r\nPrince Tsai Tze evidently still hoped that Hsu Shih-Chang, the loyal\r\nfriend of the Imperial Family, might be brought to Peking to mediate,\r\nand that he might be prevailed upon to preserve the favourable\r\ntreatment hitherto accorded the Imperial Family. I could not give\r\nPrince Tsai Tze any encouragement on this point, on which I had very\r\ndefinite opinions, but had to content myself with general expressions\r\nof sincere sympathy with the strange fate of this family.\r\n\r\nThe question of mediation was again taken up by the diplomatic corps\r\non the afternoon of this day. Some of the ministers feared that the\r\ncity would suffer greatly if things should be allowed to go on. I was\r\nstrongly of the opinion that our interference in this matter could\r\nhave no good result, but would only further confuse and complicate the\r\nsituation. For once, the Chinese must settle it themselves, regardless\r\nof any incidental inconvenience. From what I knew of the strength\r\nof the contending forces and of the whole situation, I had no doubt\r\nwhatsoever that if left alone the republican forces would be easily\r\nsuccessful and that there would be no disturbances. I was on principle\r\nagainst any action which would be in substance intervening in behalf of\r\na general who had attacked the Republic and whom nothing could now save\r\nfrom overthrow except such diplomatic action.\r\n\r\nI was approached on the 10th of July by a representative of General\r\nChiang, chief of the gendarmerie. He stated that it was desired to\r\nbring Chang Hsun into the American Legation, for his own safety though\r\nagainst his will, and that an agreement to this effect had been made\r\namong the different commanders. I stated that in the circumstances it\r\nwould be better for the diplomatic corps to discuss what protection\r\ncould be extended to Chang Hsun. An informal meeting was held, at which\r\nthe British chargé agreed that he would receive Chang Hsun if he were\r\nbrought in.\r\n\r\nThe legations were notified by General Tuan, late in the afternoon of\r\nJuly 11th, that during the night the troops would move against Chang\r\nHsun's forces in the city, and bombardment of the Temple of Heaven and\r\nthe quarters near the Imperial City held by Chang Hsun would begin at\r\ndawn on the 12th of July. In conjunction with the commandant of the\r\nlegation guard, I sent notice to the American residents in the quarters\r\nparticularly affected, directing them to seek safety. Eighteen refugees\r\ncame to the Legation, where they were cared for during the day at the\r\nStudents' Mess. A company of the Fifteenth Infantry, which had been\r\nbrought up from Tientsin, was encamped in the compound in front of my\r\nresidence, to which their tents and military equipment imparted an\r\naspect of great military preparedness.\r\n\r\nI was awakened at daybreak on July 12th by the sound of artillery and\r\nrifle fire. As the fighting commenced people went out of curiosity\r\nupon the city wall. But stray bullets frequently fell on the wall, and\r\nthe commandant ordered it cleared. Unfortunately, several of these\r\nonlookers--among them three Americans--were injured. During the battle\r\nI received word from the Imperial tutors that the Dowager Empresses\r\nwere preparing to bring the Emperor to my residence. Since the 9th of\r\nJuly they had wished to remove the Emperor to this legation for safety.\r\nWhile the Empresses and some of the dukes desired this, the eunuchs\r\nunder Chang Hsun's influence opposed the removal. The Prince Regent,\r\nalso influenced by Chang Hsun, took the same view. Thus on various\r\noccasions the eunuchs, whose existence had almost been forgotten, came\r\nout on the stage of action in this curious affair.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o'clock, while the firing was at its height and after\r\nseveral bombs had been dropped from aeroplanes upon the Imperial City,\r\ntelephone messages came to the effect that several friends of the\r\nImperial Family and Doctor Ferguson of the Red Cross were about to\r\nrescue the Emperor from danger and bring him to the Legation. I had the\r\nhouse prepared. Half an hour later two automobiles with the Red Cross\r\nflag flying entered the legation compound. Mr. Belin ran to the door,\r\nexpecting to see the Emperor and Empress emerging from the automobiles,\r\nbut he returned with only Mr. Sun Pao-chi, who was shivering with\r\nexcitement. I took him to the reception room and comforted him with\r\ntea. He still expected the Emperor to come. The automobiles left again\r\nfor the Imperial Palace, but as the aeroplanes had ceased dropping\r\nbombs and the artillery fire was decreasing in violence, the people in\r\nthe palace decided against carrying out the flight.\r\n\r\nAs I sat in the library all through the forenoon receiving reports and\r\ngiving directions, there was a constant hissing of bullets and shells\r\noverhead. No shell dropped in our legation, although two or three fell\r\nin the British. The Chinese artillery fire was remarkably accurate.\r\nSitting there and listening to the tumult of shouting and firing from\r\nthe Chenmen gate and the volleys of guns and artillery exceeding in\r\nvolume of sound any Fourth of July I had ever experienced, I felt\r\nthankful to have seen a day when the Chinese would stand up and fight\r\nout a big issue. I soon found that the battle was not commensurate with\r\nits sound.\r\n\r\nShortly before noon Chang Hsun was brought to the Dutch Legation,\r\naccompanied by a German employé of the Chinese police. Chang Hsun had\r\nbeen persuaded to come by his generals almost with the use of force.\r\nHe was still under the illusion that he could mediate. When the Dutch\r\nminister informed him that this was impossible, he wished to return to\r\nhis troops. This, of course, could not be permitted.\r\n\r\nFiring was violent from dawn until nearly noon. The field guns, machine\r\nguns, and rifles filled the air with enormous tumult, but from eleven\r\no'clock on the firing gradually diminished, and it entirely ceased at\r\nfour in the afternoon. Immediately thereafter I proceeded by motor car\r\nto the various centres of fighting. I found that Chang Hsun's house had\r\nbeen struck by several shells and that the indirect artillery firing\r\nof the government troops had been managed with considerable accuracy.\r\nThe human dead had already been removed from the neighbourhood although\r\nnumerous carcasses of horses remained. Thence I proceeded to the Temple\r\nof Heaven, where I was astonished to find Chang Hsun's troops encamped\r\nwith all their guns and artillery, eating, drinking, and talking in\r\nthe best of spirits. They told me that five of their men had been\r\nkilled, and that their bodies were still there. The absence of visible\r\nresults from the enormous expenditure of ammunition during the day was\r\nastonishing. I found, however, that the method of fighting employed\r\nby the troops was to creep up as closely as possible behind a high\r\nwall, and fire into the air in the general direction where the enemy\r\nmight be. Hence, the bystanders were in rather greater danger than the\r\ncombatants themselves. In fact, the total number of killed as a result\r\nof the fighting of July 12th was twenty-six; seventy-six were seriously\r\nwounded, and more than half of these were civilians.\r\n\r\nThe Chang Hsun contingents in the Temple of Heaven had hoisted the\r\nrepublican flag at 10 A.M. An agreement was reached by which they were\r\nto be paid $60 per man upon the delivery of their arms. Chang Hsun's\r\ntroops about the Imperial City held out for a larger payment. To my\r\nastonishment, as late as Saturday, the 14th of July, I saw fully armed\r\nsoldiers of Chang Hsun on guard at the central police headquarters.\r\nAsking the reason for this--for Chang Hsun's troops were supposedly\r\nrouted in pitched battle on the 12th of July--I was told that the\r\ncommanders had not yet settled upon the sum these contingents were to\r\nbe paid. Eighty dollars per man was finally agreed upon, and by the\r\n15th of July Chang Hsun's troops, deprived of their arms and their\r\npigtails, had left Peking with their money, and were on their way to\r\ntheir rural homes in Shantung.\r\n\r\nThe dragon flags disappeared on the 12th of July as suddenly as they\r\nhad appeared on the 2nd. The city quickly resumed its ordinary life.\r\n\r\nThe swift failure of Chang Hsun's enterprise was due to no inherent\r\nweakness of monarchical sentiment in north China. In fact, monarchist\r\nleanings among the northern military party are quite well known. It\r\nhad been assumed that such a movement would be launched, and, if it\r\nhad been more prudently planned and prepared, it might easily have\r\nsucceeded, at least for a time. Its total failure was due to the fact\r\nthat Chang Hsun, counting on monarchist tendencies among the northern\r\nmilitary men, neglected to make those preparatory negotiations which\r\nwould have turned the potential support into real strength. While\r\nthis is true, there can be no doubt that Chang Hsun's failure gave\r\nan enormous setback to the cause of monarchism in China. After two\r\nfailures to reëstablish the empire, ambitious men will think many times\r\nbefore embarking on such a venture again. Which is to say that the\r\nefforts to restore the Empire actually served to entrench more deeply\r\nthe republican form of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nWAR WITH GERMANY: READJUSTMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It has been decided by the Chinese Government to declare war; on this\r\nvery day the decision has been formally adopted by the cabinet.\"\r\n\r\nThus General Tuan Chi-jui, then Premier, conveyed to me on the 2nd of\r\nAugust the news of China's further entrance into world politics. I\r\nhad known about this from other sources. General Tuan had announced\r\nit as his policy when I visited him on the 14th of July. He had then\r\nstated that Vice-President Feng Kuo-cheng would assume the functions of\r\nPresident, which President Li would relinquish, and that it would be a\r\nwar government.\r\n\r\nThe American Government had held to its view that China should not be\r\npressed to declare war. It believed that the breaking off of diplomatic\r\nrelations, for the time being, was sufficient contribution to our\r\ncause in the war. But the Japanese, aided especially by the French,\r\nhad strongly urged the Chinese Government to join them. Not until much\r\nlater did the Chinese learn of secret treaties made between France,\r\nGreat Britain, Italy, and Japan, giving assurance to the Japanese that\r\nno effective resistance would be offered by those powers to anything\r\nwhich Japan might desire in China at the end of the war.\r\n\r\nIn their ignorance of these secret arrangements, the Chinese thought\r\nthat association with the war powers would put them on the footing of\r\nan ally. Also, doubtless, the militarist party surrounding Tuan hoped\r\nto increase its power through war activities. For my part, I allowed\r\nthe Chinese to feel that the American Government, desiring them to\r\ndecide this question according to their own best judgment, hoped that a\r\nway might be found to bring the war situation into harmony with justice\r\nto China.\r\n\r\nWhen he announced the cabinet's decision, Premier Tuan took up with\r\nme the matter of finance. He evidently expected that the American\r\nGovernment, or the Consortium, together with independent banks, would\r\nnow furnish China the money needed for her war preparations. The powers\r\nwere considering what assurances to offer. In previous discussions with\r\nChinese officials I had repeatedly dwelt on the fact that should China\r\ntake this step, she would be entitled to specific and strong assurances\r\nfrom the powers guaranteeing her political and administrative\r\nintegrity, in terms that could not easily be evaded in future. I had\r\nmade continued efforts to effect an agreement upon a declaration\r\nfavourable to the full maintenance of the sovereign rights of China. My\r\nconversations with the Japanese minister during 1916 and 1917 had this\r\nin view. Now that China was considering entry into the war, I again\r\nsuggested the desirability of such a declaration, and hinted to the\r\nChinese officials that they might be successful upon this occasion in\r\nobtaining a statement which would fortify the sovereign rights of China\r\nand prevent the further growth of special privileges and spheres of\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nMy colleagues all appeared to be favourable to the idea. It would\r\nundoubtedly have been possible for the Chinese Government to secure\r\nsuch a specific and effective declaration. Instead, however, of taking\r\nadvantage of the position which their readiness to declare war gave\r\nthem, and boldly proposing such a declaration as a necessary condition,\r\nthey became tangled up in long discussions. The substance originally\r\nproposed was worn down to a rather empty formula.\r\n\r\nThe first proposal was that the governments should declare their\r\npolicy to \"favour the independent development of China, and in no way\r\nto seek in China, either singly or jointly, advantages of the nature\r\nof territorial or preferential rights, whether local or general.\"\r\nThe Chinese had suggested, in addition, a statement that the other\r\ngovernments would accord to China their full assistance, in order\r\nto \"help it obtain the enjoyment of the advantages resulting from\r\nthe equality of powers in their international relations.\" As finally\r\nadopted, the declaration simply gave assurance of friendly support\r\nin \"allowing China to benefit in its international relations from\r\nthe situation, and from the regard due a great country.\" Vague and\r\nunmeaning as it was, the latter term was undoubtedly flattering to\r\nChinese _amour propre_. These assurances were given to China on August\r\n14th, and the United States participated in them.\r\n\r\nChina's internal political situation had not improved greatly as a\r\nresult of the overthrow of the monarchical movement. On his return\r\nto Peking as restorer of the republican government, General Tuan had\r\nthe chance to rally all elements in Chinese politics to a policy of\r\nconstructive action. With whom would he ally himself? As his distrust\r\nof the Kuo Min Tang was great, he constituted his new government\r\nwithout regard to that party, and sought instead to govern through\r\na combination of the Chin Pu Tang and the so-called Communications\r\nParty. Of the latter the real leaders, Liang Shih-yi and his immediate\r\nassociates, were still living in exile under the mandate issued\r\nby President Li. Mr. Tsao Ju-lin controlled the new wing of the\r\nCommunications Party, and he had a disproportionate prominence through\r\nJapanese support. Both he and Liang Chi-chao, the leader of the Chin\r\nPu Tang, were under the Japanese thumb. This influence could thus\r\nact strongly and extensively on Chinese affairs. It was a Japanese\r\nloan that had facilitated the overthrow of Chang Hsun and made the\r\nleadership of General Tuan possible.\r\n\r\nThese two factions, while they supported General Tuan, were mutually\r\nantagonistic. Mr. Liang Chi-chao is a literary man and a theorist.\r\nLong befriended by the Japanese, he doubtless believed himself to be\r\na patriotic Chinese who was ready to use Japanese aid, but would not\r\nsurrender any essential national rights. Not being a man of affairs,\r\nhe may not always have seen the bearing upon the ultimate independence\r\nof China of the measures which he proposed. Some Chinese as well as\r\nforeigners thought him merely the venal instrument of Japan; others\r\nregarded him as essentially honest, but subject to being misled because\r\nof his theories. As Minister of Finance, his administration tended to\r\nbring about a great increase of Japanese influence in China.\r\n\r\nMr. Tsao Ju-lin, cynical, practical-minded, and keen, is a different\r\ntype of man. He was closely associated with Mr. Lu Tsung-yu, himself\r\nthe most pliable instrument of Japanese policy in China. Mr. Tsao\r\nwas educated in Japan; one or more of his wives were Japanese, and\r\nin business and pleasure he was constantly in Japanese company. He\r\nwas out-spokenly skeptical about his own country and about republican\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe Government felt dependent upon assistance from abroad, for it had\r\nfinancial difficulties due to inherited burdens and present military\r\nexpenses. It was made to believe that assistance could come only from\r\nthe Japanese. The Americans had left the Consortium four years ago;\r\nthey had every opportunity to interest themselves in China, but they\r\nhad done nothing substantial beyond the loan of the Chicago bank. In\r\nChina, the margin between tolerable existence and financial stress is\r\nso narrow that a few million dollars may wield an enormous influence\r\nfor good or bad.\r\n\r\nThese needs were accentuated because the southern republicans were\r\nholding aloof. They felt themselves excluded from the Government; they\r\ndoubted General Tuan's honesty of purpose, and they planned to remain\r\nindependent of the central authorities. From Shanghai Mr. C.T. Wang,\r\nthe most prominent of the younger republicans, wrote that Tuan Chi-jui\r\nand his cabinet represented the reactionary element; that they were\r\nstrongly backed by undesirable foreign influence, and that the latter\r\nwould virtually control the Government. He ascribed to General Tuan\r\nthe ambition of paving the way to make himself emperor. The opposition\r\nto Tuan, he said, would continue the fight until the Chinese Republic\r\nwas indeed a republic. As to American action in China, he noted that\r\nAmerica plays the game as a gentleman, therefore it is likely to be\r\noutmanoeuvred by another country less squeamish about its methods.\r\nAnother letter from Mr. C.C. Wu, dated July 19, 1917, I will give\r\ntextually, in part:\r\n\r\n ... When General Tuan arrived at the head of his troops in Peking, he\r\n had a good opportunity to gain the goodwill and coöperation of the\r\n whole country if he had proclaimed his adherence to the constitution\r\n at present in force, and to reassemble the dissolved parliament\r\n in order that the Permanent Constitution may be completed and the\r\n organization of the future parliament provided for; in other words,\r\n that the basis for a legal and constitutional government may be\r\n found. Unfortunately, other counsels seem to have prevailed. Another\r\n assembly, without any semblance of legality, is to be convened and\r\n the future regulation of the Republic is to be left in its hands.\r\n This will only mean fresh internal dissension and strife. It is to be\r\n admitted that there is much fault to be found with the old parliament,\r\n but as I once told General Tuan, it is the name, the signboard, of\r\n parliament that we must respect.\r\n\r\n Meanwhile, the papers are full of the inquiry which the Entente Powers\r\n are alleged to have made in regard to the declaration of war against\r\n Germany, and the reply made by the Waichiao Pu that the step will be\r\n taken almost immediately. Now, it is unnecessary to tell you of my\r\n opinion in regard to this question ever since the interview we had on\r\n that fateful Sunday in February, of my firm conviction of the many\r\n advantages, both material and moral, that such a step would confer on\r\n China, nor of the efforts I have exerted in the cause. And my week's\r\n stay in Shanghai has not altered my opinion. At the same time I agree\r\n entirely with the view expressed in the note you recently presented\r\n to the Waichiao Pu on behalf of your government to the effect that\r\n the paramount need of the moment is the consolidation of the country\r\n and the establishment of an effective and responsible government, and\r\n that, compared with this, the demarche against Germany, desirable\r\n though it is, is of secondary importance. Indeed, it is nothing short\r\n of ridiculous to declare war against a foreign power when every man\r\n and every resource has to be kept in hand to meet possible civil\r\n strife and when the authority of the Central Government is effective\r\n in only a doubtful half of the country. It is difficult to see\r\n what benefit the Entente Powers expect to derive by urging such a\r\n government to take such a step, a step which is detrimental to the\r\n best interests of China and contrary to the good advice tendered by\r\n the U.S., with whom Great Britain, at least, associated herself. It\r\n is enough to make one almost suspect that it is for these very two\r\n reasons that the war measure is being urged on the Government.\r\n\r\nQuite plainly, the southern leaders believed that the party of General\r\nTuan was in its war policy animated with the purpose of building up\r\nits power at the expense of the rest of the country--particularly\r\nof subduing the southern republicans. Even less unselfish purposes\r\nwere attributed to those who based their policy on foreign financial\r\nsupport. In a speech in Parliament, Senator Kuang Yen-pao makes the\r\nofficials who contract ill-advised public loans say: \"We are planning\r\nfor the conservation of the property of our sons and grandsons; why\r\nshould we have compunctions about driving the whole people to the land\r\nof death? What matters the woe of the whole nation by the side of the\r\njoy and happiness of our own families?\" But the southern leaders did\r\nnot disavow the act of the Central Government in declaring war. Their\r\npolitical opposition continued; but they accepted the international\r\naction of Peking as binding on the whole country.\r\n\r\nIn such matters China has not the hard-and-fast ideas of sovereign\r\nauthority and legality which reign in the West. It was therefore\r\npossible for a local government to be independent in most matters,\r\nand yet to allow itself to be guided by the central authority in\r\nsome. A declaration of independence by no means implies that there\r\nare no relationships whatever between the recalcitrant ones and the\r\ncentral authorities. For this reason, too, the visit of a foreign\r\nrepresentative to any one of the governors who had declared his\r\nindependence would not, as in other countries, be regarded as an\r\naffront to the Central Government. Circumstances might occur under\r\nwhich the Central Government itself might favour such a visit, as\r\nincidentally relieving the strain. I felt quite free to send attachés\r\nof the Legation to the governors of disaffected provinces, and should\r\nquite freely have gone myself.\r\n\r\nIn all my interviews with high officials the prime subject was finance.\r\nNot that China, as an associate in the war, was to get such aid--which\r\nwas taken as a matter of course--but how it was forthcoming supplied\r\nthe only question. Mr. Liang Chi-chao, Minister of Finance, who called\r\non me on the 4th of August, talked in favour of a big loan by the\r\nConsortium. With this he hoped that the United States would again\r\nassociate itself. When he spoke of independent American loans, I called\r\nhis attention to the difficulty of concluding them or of calling up\r\nthe option under the Chicago loan, unless there were a parliament\r\nwhose authority was recognized by the country. Shortly after this I\r\nsaw the Acting President, General Feng. \"China,\" he said--undoubtedly\r\nto tell me something pleasant, but also because all Chinese do prefer\r\nassociation with America--\"China has followed the United States in the\r\npolicy of declaring war upon Germany. Now will not the United States\r\nindependently finance China? Or, if that is out of the question, then,\r\nsurely America will join the Consortium since that is the only way the\r\nChinese Government can be safely and effectively supported.\"\r\n\r\n\"The republican form of government,\" he vowed, \"is now eternally secure\r\nin China.\" I could not but remember his previous monarchist leanings.\r\nThe Acting President spoke of General Tuan. \"I have a very cordial\r\nunderstanding with the Premier,\" he assured me.\r\n\r\nI went to the Premier on the 21st of August. In this discussion the\r\nChinese iron industry came up. The Premier asked: \"Why not go ahead\r\nwith the development of mining and iron manufacture? Create a national\r\nChinese iron industry, and it will form the basis of a general loan\r\nfor industrial purposes.\" He thought, at first, that the Chinese\r\nMinistry of Agriculture and Commerce should summon experts and start\r\nthe enterprise. I told him about the enormous technical difficulties\r\nof such a project. Then he seemed to recognize that a contract with an\r\nexperienced and powerful organization, which could be held responsible,\r\nwould be more effective in establishing a national iron industry for\r\nChina. \"I am not sure about the ore deposits near Nanking,\" he added;\r\n\"they may not be included in such coöperative enterprises.\"\r\n\r\nI suspected that he was trying to get financial support from another\r\nsource, and was leaving his hands free to make them a grant there. I\r\nput in a _caveat_ against any grant of iron ores to foreign nationals.\r\nAmericans had in the past been invariably informed that iron deposits\r\ncould not be leased or granted to individuals because they had been\r\nreserved for national uses.\r\n\r\nI visited General Tuan on August 22nd and found him more talkative,\r\nmore anxious to discuss the general aspects of policies than ever\r\nbefore. \"We must first of all establish the authority of the Central\r\nGovernment,\" he said; \"this can be done only through a defeat of the\r\nopposition. My purpose is that military organization in China be made\r\nnational and unified, in order that the peace of the country shall not\r\nat all times be upset by local military commanders. The military power\r\nthus unified I intend to take entirely out of politics and confine it\r\nto its specific military purposes. At present the military is used in\r\nfactional and political disputes. When this is no longer possible, then\r\nwe shall leave the public mind in civil life entirely free to settle\r\nall questions of the Constitution and of the public policy.\"\r\n\r\nI believe the Premier was sincere in these views, and in his efforts\r\nto vindicate the authority of the National Government, but he thought\r\nonly in terms of military authority. He did not realize what the\r\norganization of public opinion and of a civilian administration\r\nrequire. His opponents feared that a consolidated military power would\r\nbe used by him, after all, to accomplish the reëstablishment of a\r\nmilitary dictatorship, such as that of Yuan Shih-kai.\r\n\r\nThe personal wisdom and integrity of General Tuan commanded respect,\r\nbut he was not fortunate in selecting his assistants. Both in Peking\r\nand in the provinces his immediate advisers gave him trouble. When he\r\nappointed General Fu Liang-tso governor of Hunan Province, he expected\r\nthe ready settlement of all difficulties there; General Fu would know\r\nhow to handle the situation. But the people of Hunan did not welcome\r\nGeneral Fu. Soon his authority and that of the Central Government were\r\nquestioned throughout that province. But the Premier never disavowed or\r\ndeserted his representatives. He was loyal to them, which accounts for\r\nthe strong personal influence which Tuan enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe country could not be unified, of course, until railways were built,\r\nand representatives of the Chinese Government often approached me to\r\nascertain Whether some action could not be taken in regard to the\r\nHankow-Canton Railway, long delayed in construction. This trunk line\r\nwould have joined the north and south. A trip from Peking to Canton by\r\nexisting routes took from ten days to two weeks: by direct railway it\r\nshould be possible to make it in two days. Not only the movement of\r\npassengers, but of mail and freight, would stimulate an intercourse\r\nthat would be sure to overcome separatist tendencies. But China had\r\nentrusted the building of this railway to foreigners, who had played\r\nwith the concession, had lost it, and, after reacquiring part of it,\r\nwere now delaying its execution. Europe was preoccupied with the war.\r\nAnd now that China was herself entering the war, it seemed a prime need\r\nof national preparedness to have this comparatively short remaining\r\ngap in the communications of China filled out. Good friends of America\r\namong the officials--among them Mr. Pan Fu, Mr. T.C. Sun, the managing\r\ndirector of the Siems-Carey railway offices, and Mr. J.C. Ho--argued\r\nwith me, as did their superiors, to have America lead in completing\r\nthis essential highway of commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE CHINESE GO A-BORROWING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time was come for China to put money in her purse. She was sure she\r\ncould do it, and sure that the United States, her great, rich sponsor\r\nand friend, would help her to the means commensurate with her needs\r\nof development for war. A suggestion to this effect had been made to\r\nthe Chinese minister at Washington by the Department of State. It was\r\nundreamt of that no assistance whatever could be given to China.\r\n\r\nDuring the fall of 1917 all my powers were devoted to securing for our\r\nFar Eastern associate in the war the best form of American assistance.\r\nI wished to avoid, if possible, a loss of the chance for giving Chinese\r\nfinancial affairs a sound basis. Above all, it was essential to aid\r\nin steering China beyond earshot of the financial sirens that were\r\nluring her upon the Japanese rocks. China invited American leadership,\r\nrelied upon it. No other nation in the circumstances could justly take\r\nexception to it. It involved no vast enterprise of immediately raising\r\na huge army in China, but of preparing the way for such mobilization,\r\nif need should arise. This could be done by facilitating works which\r\nwould endure and which would contribute to the welfare of China and\r\nthe world, war or no war. It meant building means of communication\r\nand improving the food supply. It meant reconstruction after the war.\r\nIt meant an expenditure of money that would be infinitesimal compared\r\nwith the sums spent in Europe. America had lent billions to the Entente\r\nAllies; the hundred millions that would have served to make China fit\r\nwere a mere trifle. Nor was it necessary to insist upon independent\r\nAmerican action in this matter. America's leadership in behalf of the\r\ncommon interest and in coöperation with her associates could produce\r\nthe results desired of putting the situation in the Far East on a\r\nsound basis. I had always desired American independent enterprise\r\nin individual cases, free from all entanglements and semi-political\r\narrangements with other nations, whose favour, fortunately, we did\r\nnot require. But in the great task of the World War joint action with\r\nothers was natural, and action in China, given only positive American\r\nleadership, could have produced fine results. The war powers did get\r\ntogether for some action. They suspended the Boxer indemnity payments\r\nfor China, and she got the benefit of the twentieth of _ad valorem_\r\nduty which the treaties provided; on the basis of reckonings two\r\ndecades back, the 5 per cent. had really shrunk to 3. To restore the\r\nrate fixed by the treaties was hardly a beginning of justice.\r\n\r\nHere was China, ready, willing to take her part in the war. What should\r\nshe do? In America the slogan: \"Food Will Win the War\" was in vogue,\r\nand China could furnish food. She could supply coolies, millions if\r\nnecessary, as workmen and as soldiers. The war had proved that the\r\ntraining of men as soldiers could be a matter, not of years, but of\r\nmonths. Plans were drawn up, at first for hundreds of thousands of\r\nChinese soldiers, then for half a million.\r\n\r\nI urged my proposals on the State Department. The Canton-Hankow\r\nRailway needed finishing. The Chinese arsenals and shipyards could be\r\nrefitted. I asked the consular officers and attachés for a rapid survey\r\nof China's food resources; their returns showed that a large surplus\r\ncould be produced, if steps were taken at once to assure a market.\r\nThe Chinese have a genius for growing food; among them they have the\r\nworld's most skilful gardeners. But they needed added credit if they\r\nwere to put in more seed and harvest bigger crops. In these estimates\r\nProfessor Tuck of Cornell, who was up in Manchuria, and Professor\r\nBailey, in Nanking, gave their expert aid.\r\n\r\nEngland and her European allies, it was determined, had \"gone broke\";\r\nif there was to be a Consortium of lenders to China, would America\r\nlead the way? Liang Chi-chao, Minister of Finance, proposed it. There\r\nwas China's public credit, with such vast human and material resources\r\nas to stagger belief, waiting to be organized. There was the supreme\r\nopportunity to send scattering all of the promoters of the unseemly\r\nscramble to get special advantages through Chinese financial deals. I\r\nspared no pains--for four years, indeed, I had laboured for this very\r\nthing--to impress upon America the new vision of a developed China. Two\r\nthings halted action. Outside influences working in America itself were\r\naimed to stop the free play of financial enterprise in China; next,\r\nthere was the provincialism of the New York financiers. They would only\r\nfollow where other nations led.\r\n\r\nThen there was the alternative--coöperation between the war powers. By\r\nhoops and barrages of steel we were bound to our brothers of Britain,\r\nFrance, and Italy; Japan was an allied and associated power; at every\r\npoint our gold and war bonds were mingled with theirs. We were powerful\r\nenough to hold our associates to a policy of developing China for the\r\nbenefit of all participants; an end might be put there to \"special\r\ninterests.\" I suggested a new consortium on this basis.\r\n\r\nI went to the Chinese President. \"I know,\" he declared, \"that America\r\nwill spare no means whereby China may carry out her purpose to stand by\r\nthe side of the Allies on the battlefields of Europe.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the President I went to the Premier. By this time he was not so\r\nfriendly. Time had elapsed; the glitter of Japanese money had been made\r\nto catch his eye. I inquired concerning the Japanese loan of 20,000,000\r\nyen, and incidental arrangements connected therewith. \"Does not China\r\nneed to keep a credit balance in a foreign country,\" he asked; \"and\r\nwould not the same arrangements be made with the United States if a\r\nloan were made there?\" Curiously, he added, \"There is no need, yet,\r\nof convoking parliament; no time has been set for it.\" A militarist\r\nleader, he was being comforted by hopes of Japanese backing. But he was\r\nquite willing to send a big army to Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese were alive to this situation. Professor Hori was sent\r\nto lecture on finance before an association which Liang Chi-chao had\r\nhelped form. The theme of his opening lecture was the bankruptcy of the\r\nWestern powers. China must rely on Japan for money. Following Hori came\r\na commission of ten officials from Tokyo to study Chinese financial\r\nadministration. Then came Doctor Kobayashi to act as Japan's expert\r\nin China. Prominent posts, it was freely said, were to be created for\r\n\"currency reform,\" posts which would be held by Japanese. Later on\r\nBaron Sakatani came, to study Chinese finance.\r\n\r\nFrom Japan came loans and offers of loans. They lent 10,000,000 yen\r\nthrough the Yokohama Specie Bank. This was merely an advance on a\r\nfuture reorganization loan. Then a loan, labelled \"Industrial,\" of\r\n20,000,000 yen, was made through the Bank of Communications. Two\r\nJapanese financial cliques sprang up and flourished. Liang sat at\r\nthe receipt of customs at the Ministry of Finance, dealing with the\r\nYokohama Specie Bank; the other clique, headed by Tsao Ju-lin and Lu\r\nTsung-yu, played in with the tri-fold group of the Industrial Bank\r\nof Japan, the Bank of Chosen, and the Bank of Taiwan (Formosa). With\r\nthe loan dubbed \"Industrial\"--this to evade the provisions of the\r\nreorganization loan--came Japanese advisorships in the Chinese Bank of\r\nCommunications. Not by the remotest chance would the loan be used by\r\nthe bank to strengthen its depreciated notes. It went for politics and\r\nthe military.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese financiers coolly calculated that the British and French\r\nbanks would fail to take up their option on the currency reform loan,\r\nwhich they had held since 1911. That would leave the field clear for\r\nJapan. The French and British legations got busy about this, and so did\r\nwe. As a consequence the American Government resumed its interest in\r\ncurrency reform in China, and the sigh of relief was almost audible.\r\nI called on Minister Liang. Did he not remember the Treaty of 1903\r\nand America's long-continued interest in Chinese currency betterment?\r\nThere was the Jenks-Conant Monetary Commission; there were the long\r\nnegotiations conducted by Willard Straight, and the resultant Currency\r\nLoan Agreement of 1911. \"I remember all these things,\" Liang responded;\r\n\"America should lead in this matter. Our banknote issues are being\r\nshot to pieces by local issuance of worthless paper. The Tuchuns have\r\nbent the national banks to their purposes. The books of the banks must\r\nbe kept and made public. I suggest appointing three principal foreign\r\nexperts on a reform of the entire currency. Let them be an American, a\r\nEuropean, and a Japanese.\"\r\n\r\nThe currency loan option was extended until the following April.\r\n\r\nBut Japan had other shots in her locker. Suddenly the Japanese press\r\nbristled with news of a projected \"arms alliance\" with China. It\r\nsounded almost menacing. The Tai Hei Company, originally organized\r\nby the Japanese Government to supply arms to Russia, was going to\r\nfurnish China with her armament. General Tuan said that he had long\r\nbeen urged to buy a \"limited amount\" of war material from Japan.\r\nThe Japanese minister chimed in with the statement that, inasmuch\r\nas the United States refused to sell steel to Japan--under the war\r\ntrade restriction--the time was come for Japan to control China's ore\r\ndeposits. \"Japan is to sell China arms. Why may she not have the raw\r\nmaterials for them?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe disproportion involved in this demand served to amuse the Chinese.\r\nThe deposits on which Japan's eyes were fixed amounted to from forty to\r\nfifty million tons of ore--enough to make several guns.\r\n\r\nAlong with these negotiations came proposals to establish Japanese\r\nmilitary and arsenal advisorships.\r\n\r\nI asked the Premier about these reports. I told him we could not\r\nobject to the purchase of arms by China from any source whatever.\r\nBut in negotiations for loans and concessions the United States had\r\nheld unswervingly to the principle of the \"open door\" and no special\r\nprivileges. As it sought no control of this kind, it was equally\r\ninterested that none should be given to any other power.\r\n\r\n\"Have you not,\" the Premier asked me, \"found me always candid and\r\ntrue?\" Most sincerely I assured him I had.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" he replied, \"we have bought of Japan 40,000 rifles, 160 machine\r\nguns, and 80 field guns. There will be no incidental commitments. I can\r\nrely implicitly on my military associates [General Hsu Shu-cheng, the\r\nVice-Minister of War; Ching Yun-peng, Acting Chief of Staff; and Fu\r\nLiang-tso, Tuchun of Hunan]. They would not sanction such a thing.\"\r\n\r\nBut the next day I got positive evidence that they had. The\r\nnegotiations were in full blast for Japanese military advisorships,\r\ncontrol of the Nanking Arsenal, and rights to specific iron deposits.\r\nI saw General Hsu, telling him everything before giving him a chance\r\nto answer. I was not then solely concerned about the encroachment on\r\nChinese independence. American and European interests had been told:\r\n\"Hands off the national iron ore reserve; all remaining iron deposits\r\nare to be held for the nation.\" Respecting this decision, we had told\r\nour people that concessions for iron ores could not be obtained. We\r\ncould not in justice to them now consent to a change of policy, without\r\nprotecting our interests. Japan had already one half of China's iron\r\nore deposits. Was she to get the rest? Also, were Chinese armaments\r\nto be standardized without consulting the experts of the Allied\r\nGovernments, so that the arms might be used in the present war?\r\n\r\n\"We have been hard pressed,\" General Hsu explained. \"The Japanese\r\nwished us to do something for them and we need the arms. They will be\r\nof the larger calibre, such as China's armament now has. The Japanese\r\ndid demand the assignment of new ore deposits; they needed security for\r\nthe contract. They compromised by reducing the amount of ore we are\r\nto furnish. But we must supply it under a contract of 1916, between\r\nthe Japanese and a company formed by Chow Tsu-chi, whereby a million\r\ndollars was paid in advance on iron ores from deposits near Nanking.\r\nThis is the best we can do. They demanded at first the grant of new ore\r\ndeposits.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to visit you more often,\" General Hsu remarked later;\r\n\"but my movements are closely watched.\" I stated I hoped he entertained\r\nno fear that would keep him from seeing the minister of a friendly\r\npower at any time he wished.\r\n\r\nThe real trouble lay in the rivalries between the north and south.\r\nThe Premier and General Hsu were willing to barter the nation's\r\nbirthright in the form of concessions in order to impose an internal\r\nunity of their own making. For China was torn. The situation in\r\nOctober, 1917--how different from that of April and May, 1915, when\r\nthe twenty-one demands came to their climax! Then the Chinese people\r\nand Government were united as one man. The sentiment of the nation was\r\nnow the same; nearly all the members of the Government were unchanged,\r\nyet a small pro-Japanese minority were in the saddle. The men who\r\nhad Japanese funds under their control had the advantage over the\r\nmass of officials. They succeeded in muzzling the Chinese press. By\r\nJapanese insistence, aided in this case by the French minister--some\r\nof the Chinese papers had criticized his attitude--news of diplomatic\r\nnegotiations had been absolutely suppressed. Without information,\r\nthe public was disturbed and confused. The editor of the Japanese\r\n_Kokumin_, Mr. Tokutomi, in an interview in Peking, advocated still\r\nmore stringent press control. Japan was using the war to displace\r\nthe influence of her associates in China and to make her own power\r\npredominant.\r\n\r\nBad as the situation was it might have been saved by an adequate loan\r\nfrom America. Liang's first proposal was for a reorganization loan\r\nof $200,000,000, which was vetoed by Europe; this shrivelled to the\r\nmess of pottage of 10,000,000 yen offered by the Yokohama Specie Bank.\r\nGeneral Hsu had unfolded to me in September a comprehensive scheme of\r\nequipping 500,000 soldiers, and providing for the immediate transport\r\nof at least 500,000 to Europe, further detachments were to go as fast\r\nas ships could be had. Later came more specific plans for 1,000,000\r\nmen, out of which the best contingents were to be sent to France. It\r\nwas planned ultimately to send the whole million, if needed. Then came\r\na modified proposal for outfitting 500,000 men and the completion of\r\nthe industrial plants needed for war materials and ships. The European\r\nministers were all anxious to secure China's active participation; the\r\nFrench Legation, through its military attaché, was coöperating with\r\nspecial energy in planning for the eventual use of Chinese forces. From\r\nmy conversations with the President, the Premier, and his most active\r\nassistant, there was no doubt that the Chinese were in earnest. Now it\r\nwas all simmering down to a few millions of Japanese money, supplied\r\nfor politics and internal dissension, with Japan seeking special\r\nadvantages.\r\n\r\nWork was to be done. The United States could still bring relief and\r\na strong call for united action into this troubled situation without\r\ngiving just cause for complaint or for taking offence. The French were\r\nespecially desirous of bringing the Chinese actually into the war.\r\nThe Belgians wished the mobilization of Chinese material resources,\r\nparticularly foodstuffs. The British were in general accord, though\r\nthey doubted whether Chinese troops could be soon transported to the\r\ntheatre of war. Dr. George Morrison who had just gone over the whole\r\nsituation with the President and cabinet, came to me saying: \"The\r\nChinese will apply to you for advice. You have a freer hand than the\r\nBritish minister.\"\r\n\r\nBut an event of profound significance was impending, and it interrupted\r\nmy efforts along these constructive lines. It was at this time that\r\nthe results of Japan's efforts to reach an agreement with the State\r\nDepartment in Washington became known to China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nLAST YEAR OF WAR AND AFTERMATH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE LANSING-ISHII NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in rather an indirect way that I learned of the secret\r\nnegotiations which had been going on between the head of the State\r\nDepartment in Washington and the Japanese Government. Since these\r\nnegotiations concerned some of the most vital problems in the whole\r\nChinese situation, it was surprising that everyone had been kept in\r\nignorance of them. I learned of them, I confess with mingled emotions,\r\nfrom none other than Baron Hayashi himself. I called on him on the\r\nevening of November 4th; and, after going over the matter of routine\r\nwhich I had wished to take up with him, I remained chatting pleasantly\r\nwith him. In the course of our talk the Baron remarked: \"I have just\r\nreceived some information that is quite important, and I want you to\r\nknow about it. Let me get the cablegram.\"\r\n\r\nHe brought a paper and handed it over to me without comment. It\r\nwas a cablegram from Tokyo that informed him of the signing of\r\nthe Lansing-Ishii notes, and gave a summary of their text. The\r\nfirst paragraph contained the vital clause: \"The Government of the\r\nUnited States recognizes that Japan has special interests in China,\r\nparticularly in the part to which her possessions are contiguous.\" This\r\nnaturally struck me in the face with stunning force, before I had time\r\nto weigh its meaning in relation to the remainder of the declaration.\r\nI read the dispatch twice and made an effort to impress its salient\r\npoints on my memory, and then turned to my Japanese colleague\r\nattempting to retain my composure.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I managed to say, \"this is quite interesting. It is somewhat in\r\nline with conversations we have had, yet differs in some respects.\"\r\n\r\nI forced myself to remain a little longer and tried to continue the\r\nmatter-of-fact conversation which this astounding piece of news had\r\ninterrupted. When I finally took my leave, I was uncertain whether\r\nBaron Hayashi did or did not know that I had been unaware of this\r\nexchange of notes. Hurrying to the Legation, I dispatched a cablegram\r\nto the Department asking that I be informed.\r\n\r\nIt had been agreed, so the cable from Tokyo had stated, that an\r\nannouncement of the parley should not be given out until November 7th.\r\nBut the Japanese minister had already informed the Chinese Foreign\r\nOffice on Sunday night; and early on Monday its representative called\r\nto get my version of the matter.\r\n\r\nNo word had been sent me. It was inexcusable to fail to give the local\r\nrepresentative the earliest possible information, and I intimated as\r\nmuch in my cablegram to the Secretary of State. As the Foreign Office\r\nhad been fully informed, I could only state to my visitor that I was\r\nnot authorized to deliver the text until later, and that I was myself\r\nstill considering the full import of the document, which in certain\r\nrespects followed lines of policy that had been discussed in the past.\r\n\r\nAs I could plainly see, the notes had been paraded in the Chinese\r\nForeign Office as yielding important concessions from the United\r\nStates and as a diplomatic triumph for Japan. I knew nothing of the\r\nmotives which had animated the President and Secretary of State when\r\nthey agreed to the paper. I could not explain its purposes; but when\r\nmy visitor asked: \"Does this paper recognize the paramount position of\r\nJapan in China?\" I could and did answer with an emphatic \"No.\" Beyond\r\nthat I said nothing.\r\n\r\nAll that day and the next reports streamed in from many quarters that\r\nthe Japanese were \"crowing over their victory\" in their talks with\r\nthe Chinese. More Chinese officials and many Americans applied at the\r\nLegation for authentic word. But no help came from the Department of\r\nState. Indeed no word reached me until the morning of the 7th.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that the American secrecy pledge was not\r\npunctiliously observed--even to the extent of keeping in ignorance\r\nthe American minister, who would have to bear the brunt of the\r\nconsequences of this diplomatic manoeuvre. The Japanese, meanwhile,\r\nhad given the note not only to the Chinese Government several days in\r\nadvance, but--was it out of abhorrence for secret diplomacy?--even\r\nbefore the notes had been signed their text was communicated to the\r\nrepresentatives of Great Britain, Russia, France, and Italy. This was\r\ndone at Tokyo.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that this procedure produced upon the Chinese the\r\nimpression that the Japanese had got what they wanted. They thought the\r\ndeclarations made by the United States contained admission of a special\r\nposition held by Japan in China, not desired by the latter, but forced\r\nthrough by the military and political power of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe reception given the note by Far Eastern experts and by the public\r\nindicated that it would be interpreted in widely varying fashion. The\r\nfirst impression only gradually gave way to a calmer judgment when\r\nthe specific terms of the notes were carefully read and the ambiguous\r\ncharacter of the instrument was realized. In the first place, the\r\nJapanese Legation, in translating for the benefit of the Chinese\r\nMinistry, had used for \"special interest\" a Chinese term which implied\r\nthe idea of \"special position.\" Doctor Tenney's more direct translation\r\nof the term was without this extra shade. The Department authorized\r\nme to deliver an explanatory note to the effect that the interests\r\nreferred to were of an economic, not a political, nature. It referred\r\nto \"Japan's commercial and industrial enterprises in China\"; these, it\r\nadded, \"manifestly have, on account of the geographical relation of\r\nthe two countries, a certain advantage over similar enterprises on the\r\npart of citizens or subjects of any other country.\"\r\n\r\nI could not avoid the feeling that the form which the exchange of\r\nnotes at Washington had taken was unfortunate. It was indeed desirable\r\nthat the friendly attitude of the United States toward all Japan's\r\neconomic activities in China should be stated strongly. This had been\r\nthe tenor of the conversations between successive Japanese ministers\r\nand myself, which had been communicated to the State Department. It was\r\nnecessary, if the Japanese really entertained it, to disabuse them of\r\nthe conception that the political influence of the United States was\r\nbeing used to discourage close business relationships between China and\r\nJapan, and to frown upon Japanese enterprises in China. On the basis\r\nof such an understanding, it was hoped that Japan would join with the\r\nUnited States in agreeing that special privileges in any part of China,\r\nor any sort of economic advantage, would not be sought by political\r\nmeans; that the Manchurian régime, to be more specific, would not\r\nextend to other parts of China.\r\n\r\nBut the notes definitely stated that Japan would not use her special\r\ninterests in a way to \"discriminate against the trade of other nations,\r\nor to disregard the commercial rights heretofore granted by China in\r\nthe treaties with other powers.\" This might give rise to the idea that\r\n\"special interests\" did not refer merely to specific economic interests\r\nand enterprises. It might include also a certain political influence or\r\npreference.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese minister, though disclaiming a reading which would imply\r\na paramount interest, evidently saw in the notes an endorsement of the\r\nprinciple of spheres of influence. \"The notes speak for themselves,\" he\r\nsaid in an interview on the 8th of November; \"they simply again place\r\non record the acknowledged attitude of the United States and Japan\r\ntoward China. They are simply a restatement of an old position. Even\r\nthe term 'special interests' is doubtless used in the same sense here\r\nas in the past. Several other countries have territory that borders on\r\nChina; this fact gives them a special interest in these parts of China\r\nwhich they touch. In exactly the same way, Japan has special rights in\r\nChina.\"\r\n\r\nThe non-official Japanese statements claimed much more than this. They\r\ndid \"crow over\" the Chinese. Was not here a vindication of distinct\r\npriority enjoyed by Japan in China? In Japan the veteran Okuma, who\r\nis never backward in airing his opinions in the press, also seemed to\r\nhave a rather broad idea of the notes. \"Hitherto,\" he said, \"America's\r\nactivities in China were often imprudent and thoughtless. For instance,\r\nSecretary Knox's proposal to neutralize the Manchurian Railway was,\r\nindeed, a reckless move. The United States also relegated Japan to the\r\nbackground when she sent the note of June 7th to China, advising that\r\ncountry concerning domestic peace. Thus America disregarded Japan's\r\nspecial position in China. We may understand that she will not repeat\r\nsuch follies, in the light of the new convention.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, there is nothing in the notes to interfere with the\r\nfullest and freest interchange of communications between the American\r\nGovernment and the Chinese, on any topic whatever.\r\n\r\nIn reporting his conversation on the notes with the Japanese Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs before they were signed, the Russian ambassador\r\nat Tokyo hit it off in this way: \"Nevertheless, I gain the impression\r\nfrom the words of the minister that he is conscious of the possibility\r\nof misunderstandings, also, in the future; but is of the opinion that\r\nin such a case Japan would have at her disposal better means than the\r\nUnited States for carrying into effect her interpretation.\"\r\n\r\nTo show how different people were affected, I shall cite from some\r\nletters. Dr. George Morrison wrote to a friend from southern China:\r\n\"Relays of Chinese have thronged to see the American consul, all\r\nsounding one note--that they have been betrayed by America. After all\r\nher valiant protestations, what earthly good did America gain by making\r\nsuch a concession to Japan, giving recognition to that which every\r\nAmerican and Englishman in China had been endeavouring to prevent?\r\nCarried to its logical conclusion this agreement gives recognition not\r\nonly to Japan's 'special interests' in Manchuria, but also to those\r\nin Fukien Province which lies in 'geographical proximity' to Formosa.\r\nSurely the British will now claim recognition of similar rights in\r\nKwangsi Province. It is all very deplorable.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Britisher, Mr. W.H. Donald, took a different view. \"When I saw\r\nthe notes,\" he wrote, \"I was delighted, because I read into them the\r\nfact that America had, to use an Americanism, 'put one over' Japan.\r\nIshii went to America to get acquiescence in Japan's predominance in\r\nChina; to get America to admit Japan's hegemony of the Pacific. He\r\ngot neither. Instead, he had to reaffirm adherence to the previous\r\nundertakings--undertakings which were discarded when Japan put in her\r\ntwenty-one demands.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chinese papers generally pronounced the notes inconsistent. The\r\n_Chung Hua Hsin Pao_ saw no need for having the \"special interests\" of\r\nJapan particularly recognized any more than those of other nations,\r\nlike Great Britain, France, Russia, and the United States, all of\r\nwhich have territory adjacent to China. The paper thought that the\r\nassurance that Japan seeks no special rights or privileges, should be\r\ntaken at its face value when the point of the whole agreement was the\r\nrecognition of \"special interests\" enjoyed by Japan. The tenor of the\r\nnote, therefore, appeared to favour \"special interests,\" consequently\r\nthe division of China into spheres of influence--contrary to the\r\ntraditional policy of the United States.\r\n\r\nPersonally, from my knowledge of the situation in the Far East, I could\r\nnot see any urgent reason for making this declaration. I learned later\r\nthat the notes had been drawn up in consultation between the President\r\nand the Secretary of State, without other reference to the Department\r\nof State and without the knowledge of its staff. Also, the Secretary\r\nhad acted upon the belief and understanding that the first statement\r\nconcerning special interests was simply a self-evident axiom, but that\r\nits restatement would clarify the situation. Certainly, on the other\r\nhand, the positive affirmative pledge against \"the acquisition by any\r\ngovernment of any special rights or privileges\" was clearer and went\r\nfurther than any previous declaration.\r\n\r\nTo safeguard its rights under any construction that might be given\r\nto the document, the Chinese Government declared that it could not\r\nrecognize any agreement relating to China entered into between other\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nI have said that I could not see the need of these notes. Failing to\r\nreceive instructions which I sought from the Department of State,\r\nI continued to take the position that the policy of the American\r\nGovernment remained unchanged with respect to the existence of a\r\nspecial position or special privileges on the part of any other\r\npower in China. But the immediate effect of the notes on the Chinese\r\nGovernment was to make its high officials feel that nothing very\r\npositive could be expected from the United States by way of assistance\r\nout of the nation's difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe general and continuing effect of the notes was seen in the\r\nbehaviour of the Japanese in China. The Japanese papers boldly\r\ndeclared that Japan would interpret the term \"special interests\" in\r\na way to suit herself, and that it implied the supremacy of Japanese\r\npolitical influence in China. The thrusting forward of this View did\r\nnot strengthen the government of General Tuan. Several more provinces\r\nfollowed those which had declared their independence with acts that\r\nmade their allegiance at least doubtful. General Tuan's appointee as\r\nmilitary governor of Hunan suffered defeat at the hands of the southern\r\ntroops. The governors of the Yangtse Valley, under the leadership of\r\nGeneral Li Shun, addressed to the Government pointed inquiries about\r\nfinancial dealings with the Japanese and the purchase of arms, which\r\nwas reported to involve an arms alliance.\r\n\r\nAs the attacks were directed at him personally, General Tuan felt that\r\nhe must resign. Notwithstanding an outward show of amity, General Feng\r\nKuo-chang and the Premier had actually not agreed. The Premier wished\r\nto make war on the south and conquer it. The Acting President, on the\r\nother hand, was in constant correspondence with southern leaders in an\r\nattempt to bring about reconciliation. Tuan sent in his resignation.\r\nThe Japanese worked for his retention. The President did ask him to\r\nreconsider, but his resignation finally took effect on the 20th of\r\nNovember. General Wang Shih-chen, who was close to the President as\r\nchief of staff, became acting premier. But Tsao Ju-lin, who headed the\r\nJapanese clique, was retained.\r\n\r\nPeace and unity did not result. The northern Tuchuns gathered at\r\nTientsin on December 4th, and decided to push the war against the south\r\nwith 200,000 men. This was to be made a pretext for getting more funds.\r\n\r\nI kept in touch with General Tuan, in whose personal character and\r\nhonesty of purpose in wishing China to take part in the war I placed\r\nreliance. Also his friend, Mr. Chu Ying-kuang, who had made a fine\r\nrecord as civilian governor of Chekiang, had kept his eye mainly on\r\nthis goal. Through them I kept in touch with all of the Chinese who\r\nfostered such action. If the Chinese of their own initiative should\r\ncreate services for supplying urgent needs of the Allies, and should\r\ntrain a model division for use on the battlefields of Europe, I\r\nfelt that the United States and her associates would find a way to\r\ntransport them to Europe. General Tuan was now free of politics. In\r\nthe conversations I had with the Premier and his associates, the idea\r\nof a special organization for preparedness was talked over. The upshot\r\nof this was the creation of a War Participation Office, with General\r\nTuan as its president. The Office was to make constructive plans for\r\ndeveloping resources useful in the war, and for training troops for\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Japanese were \"cutting loose\" in Shantung. Quite openly\r\nthey were trying to set up an administration in what they called the\r\nrailway zone. The agreements between China and Germany contained no\r\nprovision for such a zone. The Germans merely had the railway itself,\r\nand certain specific mining enterprises, together with the port of\r\nTsingtao. A general priority in the mining districts within a zone\r\nof ten miles along each side of the railway had been abandoned some\r\ntime previous to the war. Now the Japanese asserted in this \"zone\"\r\ngeneral administrative power, including policing, taxation, forestry,\r\nand education. With this encroachment, the Chinese noted evidences of\r\nJapanese toleration of revolutionary and bandit activities wherever\r\nthey served the purposes of the invaders.\r\n\r\nPeople came frequently from Shantung to see me in order to lay before\r\nme their complaints and petitions. They were distressed, but I could\r\nnot help them, save where American rights were involved. The Shantung\r\nmen reported that the Japanese were making the Lansing-Ishii notes the\r\nbasis of their propaganda, stating that Japan's special position had\r\nnow been recognized. This penetration into the interior of one of the\r\nprovinces of China proper by a foreign political administration was\r\nundoubtedly the most serious attack ever made on Chinese sovereignty.\r\n\r\nA member of the Chinese Foreign Office called on me on the 21st of\r\nDecember, and spoke earnestly about the Japanese inroads in Shantung.\r\nHe said nothing could stop the Japanese. Their minister had stated that\r\nit would be difficult to change an ordinance signed by the Premier and\r\nsanctioned by the Emperor.\r\n\r\nAmong both Chinese officials and the general public all was\r\ndiscouragement and depression. The first effect of the Lansing-Ishii\r\nnotes, the strong influence exercised by the pro-Japanese clique in the\r\ngovernment because of the financial backing they got, the knowledge\r\nthat such backing had to be bought with valuable national concessions,\r\nthe increasing disunion between north and south, the general despair\r\nof any constructive and unifying policy being possible, made the\r\nChinese individually and collectively paralysed with doubt, fear, and a\r\nfeeling of impotence. It was plain that Japanese influences, making a\r\npolitico-commercial campaign in China, were everywhere actively taking\r\nadvantage of this demoralized state of the public mind and intensifying\r\nit through their manipulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nAMIDST TROUBLES PEKING REJOICES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Armistice meant the end of the Great War. Would it also mean the\r\nend of sinister intrigue in China?\r\n\r\nIn the joy of the world victory everybody felt so. But when I returned\r\nto Peking early in October, 1918, I found that things had gone from bad\r\nto worse. Money had been squandered on war expeditions which had torn\r\nthe country, not united it. The unofficial Japanese financial agent,\r\nMr. Nishihara, a borer in the rotten trunk of Chinese finance, had\r\nbeen at work all summer. The fact of his loan negotiations was denied\r\nto the very last by the Japanese Legation. Suddenly, on October 1st,\r\nJapan's Minister of Finance announced that his government had arranged\r\na number of loans to the Chinese. They involved commitments in the sum\r\nof 320,000,000 yen, ostensibly to build railways and iron works; of\r\nthis amount 40,000,000 yen would be immediately advanced.\r\n\r\nThe earlier loans had all gone to the inept militarists. The advances\r\non these so-called industrial loans were in the same way dissipated\r\nin partisanship, division, distraction. The new parliament had been\r\nelected. It was to elect a new president. Money was poured into the\r\ncontest between Feng, the Acting President, and Hsu Shih-chang.\r\nGeneral Tuan had his army of small political adherents, who battened\r\non the funds supplied by the chief manipulators. They formed the Anfu\r\nClub--from _An_hui, the province of the army clique, and _Fu_kien, the\r\nprovince whence the navy drew most of its admirals.\r\n\r\nThe inner military ring was operating from the War Participation\r\nBureau, which had preëmpted the control of finance, natural resources,\r\nand police. The ministries were powerless. The Government was debauched\r\nwith the easy money from Japan. With a sardonic grin, the Japanese\r\noffered to lend China 200,000,000 paper yen, not redeemable, on which\r\nthe Chinese Government should base a gold-note issue. On this paper of\r\nthe Bank of Korea China should repay Japan, with interest annually.\r\n\r\nUsing the militarists, they tried hard to put it through. But the\r\nforeign press, and such Chinese papers as dared, succeeded in laughing\r\nit down. Redeemable in Korean or Japanese banknotes, which the Chinese\r\nnever use in daily trade, the proposed government gold notes could\r\nnot have been forced into circulation. They would only have worse\r\nconfounded the already existing monetary confusion.\r\n\r\nThe police terrorized and bullied the papers that opposed Japan's\r\nloan negotiations and printed the facts about them. Nearly a dozen\r\nwere suppressed. The Anfu gang had cowed the Government and people in\r\nnorth China. Without moral and legal authority, it made the Government\r\nimpotent in its prime functions, such as levying taxes and protecting\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic corps had to consider whether the customs and salt\r\nrevenues should be released to such a government. The best interests\r\nnot only of China, but of all the friendly nations, including\r\nJapan herself, were being blighted. The prostitution of the War\r\nParticipation Bureau by the gold-lust of the militarists, with Japan\r\nas pander, fostered the brawls of faction and disunion. Public opinion\r\nwas throttled and the corrupt elements found no organized popular\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nTsao Ju-lin, Minister of Finance, advocated the spurious gold-note\r\nproject, which had been dubbed the \"gold-brick scheme.\" Tsao had\r\nrepresented that the diplomatic corps had approved this scheme. Four\r\nministers jointly informed the Chinese Government that Mr. Tsao's\r\nmethods tended to destroy confidence between the Government and the\r\nlegations, and one minister said his legation would thenceforward\r\naccept no statement coming from the Minister of Finance until the\r\nForeign Office had vouched for its truth.\r\n\r\nThe Finance Minister unblushingly tried to suspend the renewal of the\r\ncurrency loan option until the foreign banks should consent to the\r\ngold-note scheme. Here I protested, saying that under the Currency Loan\r\nAgreement the American Government had a right to be consulted before\r\nany such proposals could be considered.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency Hsu Shih-chang was elected President--a veteran\r\nstatesman of the old régime. In my first interview with him he\r\ncomplained: \"I am trying to deal with the south; but they have nobody\r\nto bind them together and represent them. We are demobilizing most of\r\nour superfluous troops, but I am worried because the Government lacks\r\nfinancial support.\"\r\n\r\nI talked with him again often. General Li Shun, of Nanking, had been\r\nasked to mediate. The southern leaders needed to be \"grubstaked\" to pay\r\noff their troops, then an agreement with them could be reached. The\r\nPresident's solution smacked of buying them off. But this would not\r\nend the militarist intriguing. President Hsu issued on October 25th a\r\npeace mandate, taking President Wilson's statement about reconstituting\r\ninternational unity as his point of departure. The President had cabled\r\nthis to Hsu when he was inaugurated. The press was reporting that the\r\nBritish and American ministers were working for internal peace; our\r\nmediation would have been popular. It would have pulled the leaders of\r\nnorth and south out of their impasse. President Hsu cabled back to Mr.\r\nWilson: \"Though we are separated by a great distance, yet I feel your\r\ninfluence as if we were face to face.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Hsu had gotten a report from Dr. George E. Morrison, who had\r\nreturned from investigations in south China. Doctor Morrison made the\r\npoint that internal strife must be ended if China was to do anything\r\nin the Great War and to hold up her rights strongly at the Peace\r\nConference. I will quote this report somewhat at length:\r\n\r\n China under the advice of several of her more powerful ministers looks\r\n to Japan for guidance, Japan having in an incredibly short space\r\n of time, by the energy and patriotism of her united people and the\r\n wisdom of her rulers, raised herself to an important position among\r\n the nations. But Japan is no longer one of the great world powers.\r\n Japan lacks experience of modern war. Her army and navy are much out\r\n of date. Her troops have no experience of the marvellous methods of\r\n modern war. She has no submarine service, she has no air service.\r\n Her government, created after the model of Germany, her kaiserism,\r\n her Prussian militarism, are fast becoming obsolete. Compared with\r\n the great powers of Great Britain, America, France, and Italy, the\r\n strength of Japan is meagre. Japan at the end of the European war is\r\n a third-rate power. Her government is the only military autocracy\r\n existing in the world to-day, and for that reason Japan will occupy a\r\n unique position at any peace conference. Japan is the only one of the\r\n Allied nations who has failed to take any adequate part in the great\r\n world struggle.\r\n\r\n For China, a republic, to seek the guidance of the only existing\r\n autocratic military government in the world to-day has at least the\r\n appearance of inconsistency. Such action is viewed with suspicion by\r\n all those in China who are aspiring to a democratic government--a\r\n government by the people for the people.\r\n\r\n If intervention is to be prevented, there must be early restoration\r\n of democratic government, early reconciliation. As the simplest and\r\n quickest way in which this can be effected, I suggest that your\r\n Excellency invite the President of the United States to act as\r\n mediator, to bring together representatives of the two great parties\r\n of state in China that they may hear and weigh each other's view and\r\n agree to a compromise. There is no loss of face in doing this.\r\n\r\n During my recent visit to the south I gave expression to Chinese views\r\n to all the leading men with whom I had the opportunity of discussing\r\n the question of peace and reconciliation in China. All without\r\n exception expressed their belief and confidence that an invitation to\r\n the President of the United States to act as mediator would be a wise\r\n act and one that promised the easiest solution of the grave conflict\r\n which at present divides into hostile camps this fair land of China.\r\n\r\nJapan persisted in her work, the United States remained indifferent.\r\n\r\nThe people of China got tired of all this. As a matter of fact, China\r\nwas divided only on the surface. Deep down into the life of the people\r\npolitical controversies had not penetrated. They went on, placid and\r\nindustrious, regardless of the bickerings of politicians. Chinese\r\nrevolutions and declarations of independence might be bruited to the\r\nworld, which might think China had plunged into anarchy. As a people\r\nthe Chinese are freer from governmental interference than any nation\r\nliving. If the entire Central Government should suddenly disappear from\r\nthe face of the earth, it would make little difference in China. Yet\r\nthe long continuance of political conflicts lets foreign intrigue into\r\nthe national quarrels, and so reacts dangerously.\r\n\r\nThe people as a whole wished the nation to be a unit. But the\r\nprofessional militarists had to be paid off. After the President had\r\nissued his peace mandate, he asked that I see him. \"If decisive action\r\nfor peace is taken,\" he asked, \"may we depend on the United States\r\nto back us in getting funds to pay off these large bodies of troops?\r\nIf not, will she not lead in a reorganization loan joined by several\r\npowers?\"\r\n\r\nI asked the American Government for the funds desired. If they came\r\nconditionally upon the reunion of China, the responsible military\r\ngovernors and civilian leaders north and south would have the means\r\nto be rid of the predatory and parasitic bands. Japan then roused\r\nherself. She approached the governments of the United States, France,\r\nGreat Britain, and Italy on October 23rd, asking that they work toward\r\na peace settlement with the leaders both north and south. The American\r\nGovernment approved, adding that China needed money, but that no funds\r\nwould be afforded her until a reunited government was seated.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the temper of the Chinese people was sounded in a\r\ngratifying way. John Mott asked the Y.M.C.A. in China to raise $100,000\r\nfor the War Works Drive. I sat at dinner one evening with Liang Shih-yi\r\nand Chow Tsu-chi, and said: \"A drive is going on in the United States\r\nto aid all the war works undertaken for the benefit of the soldiers at\r\nthe front. Do you suppose that some of our friends in China would wish\r\nto contribute?\" They both replied: \"Yes, we are sure they would.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days elapsed. Chow Tsu-chi called, told me they had formed a\r\nNational War Works Committee, and that local committees were being\r\nformed in every provincial capital. They raised, not $100,000, but more\r\nthan $1,000,000!\r\n\r\nIt was the more remarkable because this way of contributing to a public\r\npurpose had never been tried in China. Only the _Shun Tien Shih Pao_ of\r\nPeking, Japanese-controlled, threw cold water on the movement, saying\r\nthat to be sending money to Europe while so many provinces in China\r\nthemselves needed aid was peculiar.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the Associated Powers met on October 18th.\r\nThey felt that participation in the war had not united China; a\r\nclique had perverted it to factional uses. Each representative, it\r\nwas agreed, should present instances in which the Central Government\r\nor local officials had obstructed action or been remiss. At the next\r\nmeeting, on the 28th, I had prepared a memorandum of instances; this\r\nwas made the basis of a statement. A conference was to be held with\r\nthe President of China, to be quite friendly, but to make manifest\r\nthe grave shortcomings due to political vices. Thus, it was thought,\r\nthe responsible and conscientious elements in the Government would\r\nbe fortified against the clique that had invaded it. The Foreign\r\nMinister, however, asked that the conference be deferred, in order that\r\nthe Government might strive to bring its action more completely into\r\naccord with its real desire. There was no threat in our suggestion. But\r\npublicists often overlooked its true object, and treated it as if it\r\nhad been a condemnation of China rather than of the controlling clique\r\nin the Government.\r\n\r\nJoy and cheerfulness greeted the news of the Armistice. The American\r\nLegation Band was the first to celebrate, with a detachment of marines\r\nit paraded the legation compounds; only the Japanese Legation sentinel\r\nfailed to salute it; he had failed to gather its purport. At Sir John\r\nJordan's personal invitation I joined the British Legation's impromptu\r\nfestivities that night, with some members of my staff. Responding to\r\nSir John's remarks of welcome, I spoke of the trinity of democratic\r\npeoples, the British, French, and Americans, as destined to lead the\r\nworld to a fuller understanding of free institutions and popular rights.\r\n\r\nIn the continuous round of festivities and celebrations the foreign\r\nand Chinese communities joined whole-heartedly, with dinners,\r\nreceptions, special meetings of societies, and finally a great national\r\ncelebration on the 28th of November. We gave a reception on the 20th\r\nto the ministers of the Associated Powers. As each minister arrived,\r\nthe national air of his country was played by the Marine Band. When\r\nthe Russian minister came in, the band, without special instructions,\r\nplayed the old Russian Imperial hymn. Prince Koudacheff was moved, for\r\nthis anthem was now outlawed in his country; he came to me in tears.\r\nNext day he showed me a song with music which he had suggested for\r\nadoption by the Siberian Government as the Russian national hymn. But\r\nat the solemn service held on the Sunday following, when the national\r\nairs of the different countries were played, when the turn came for the\r\nRussian hymn a pause was noted. Those conducting the service had ruled\r\nout the old Imperial hymn. As there was apparently no music available\r\nas a substitute, poor Russia had to go unsaluted.\r\n\r\nFrom early in the morning of the national celebration, Chinese troops\r\nmarched toward the Imperial City, where they lined the spacious\r\ninterior courts. The legation guards followed. Multitudes of Europeans\r\nand Chinese flocked to the palace, where the diplomats were gathered,\r\nall but myself resplendent in gorgeous uniforms. The neutral ministers,\r\ntoo, were in attendance. The European adviser had found a precedent\r\namong peace celebrations in Europe, such as that after the Danish War\r\nand the Franco-Prussian War, in accordance with which the neutral\r\nministers might attend, though peace was not fully concluded. Also,\r\nit was argued that the Chinese were celebrating the cessation of\r\nhostilities, and the participation of friendly representatives might be\r\ninvited.\r\n\r\nWhispered controversy was heard among the ministers. The representative\r\nof France, seeing senior neutral representatives ahead of him, said\r\nthis occasion was different, and demanded that the rank of precedence\r\nbe changed. Time was too short for so thorny a problem. We agreed to\r\nsay nothing at all, but to walk in a group forming itself spontaneously.\r\n\r\nWe gathered in the pavilion of the Ta Ho-men, the gate which leads into\r\nthe court immediately before the main Coronation Hall of the Imperial\r\nCity. Here, in the very inner sanctuary of the thousand-year-old\r\nimperialism of China, the victory of freedom was celebrated. The square\r\nwas massed with troops, Chinese and foreign. On the ascending terraces\r\nstood thousands of guests, the military and officials in uniform; over\r\nthe balustrades waved forests of flags of the Associated Nations, as\r\nwell as long floating banners with Chinese inscriptions in gold.\r\n\r\nAfter the President had ascended the steps to the music of bands\r\nof the nations, bowed to all the flags, and made his address,\r\naeroplanes appeared, dropping innumerable Chinese flags and messages\r\nof felicitation printed in gold on red; then they continued to circle\r\nabove the Imperial City. While the military were marching to the gate,\r\nrockets were sent skyward; exploding, they released paper figures of\r\nanimals, as well as soldiers and weapons of war, which floated a long\r\ntime in the air. When the President left the Tung Hua Palace, where he\r\nhad received thousands of guests, the aeroplanes preceded him on his\r\nride to his own residence.\r\n\r\nWe celebrated Thanksgiving that afternoon in American fashion with\r\na religious service, the American colony and many British and\r\nother Allied residents attending, as well as the ministers of the\r\nAssociated Powers with their staffs. Premier Chien Neng-hsun dined\r\nthe diplomatic corps and welcomed President Wilson's proposal for a\r\nleague of nations. President Hsu invited us on November 30th, and then\r\nthe French minister, who still was troubled with the question of the\r\nnon-belligerents, objected to the neutral ministers being there at all.\r\nIf they went, he said, he would not go. The British minister and I\r\ndevised, as we thought, a way out. Would the neutral ministers view the\r\nAllied ministers as guests of honour on this occasion? The secretary\r\nto the Foreign Minister was chosen to ask them. Unfortunately, the\r\nneutrals took it as a demand rather than an inquiry. Then the fat was\r\nin the fire--the neutral ministers would not attend the dinner. This\r\nwas the one discordant note in our celebrations.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable the Central Government to get along at all, the\r\ndiplomatic corps agreed to the release of surplus salt revenues to the\r\nextent of $5,300,000. President Hsu on the 16th of November ordered\r\nimmediate cessation of hostilities in the Chinese interior. The\r\nnorthern leaders were still war-like, but accepted his decision. The\r\nBritish, French, American, Japanese, and Italian representatives and\r\nmyself met on the 22nd to uphold President Hsu's attitude. We took\r\nup the Japanese proposals, deciding that identical representations\r\nbe made at Peking and Canton. My colleagues asked me to draft an\r\n_aide mémoire_ which was to accompany the oral representations.\r\nJapan objected to including in it the American suggestion that no\r\nfinancial advances would be made now but that a reunited China would\r\nget support from the powers. The Japanese banks had bound themselves\r\nto make further payments to China, it was said. The _aide mémoire_\r\ndeplored disunion, disavowed wishing to intervene, and hoped that,\r\n\"while refraining from taking any steps which might obstruct peace,\r\nboth parties would seek without delay, by frank confidence, the means\r\nof obtaining reconciliation.\" In the clause about obstructing peace\r\nI had in mind such acts as the election of a northern militarist as\r\nVice-President. This, though in itself a peaceful act, would have\r\nraised an insurmountable obstacle to peace.\r\n\r\nFive powers were represented in an audience before the President on\r\nDecember 2nd, the British minister speaking. The northern military\r\nleaders had held a conference at Tientsin. If, as reported, they wished\r\nto demand that Tuan be reinstalled as Premier, and that Tsao Kun,\r\nMilitary Governor of Chihli, be elected Vice-President, it would have\r\nembittered the south. The public therefore welcomed the representations\r\nof the powers. The American reference to loans was omitted;\r\nnevertheless, the situation produced made it no longer possible for any\r\none country to lend money to either faction without putting itself in\r\nan equivocal position.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese felt moved on the 3rd of December to publish a statement\r\nabout Chinese finance. Japan could not discourage financial and\r\neconomic enterprises of its nationals in China, the statement read, \"so\r\nlong as these enterprises are the natural and legitimate outgrowth of\r\nspecial relations between the two neighbouring and friendly nations. At\r\nthe same time they fully realize that under the existing conditions of\r\ndomestic strife in China loans are liable to create misunderstandings\r\nand to interfere with peace in China. Accordingly, the Japanese\r\nGovernment has decided to withhold such financial assistance to China\r\nas is likely in their opinion to add to the complications of her\r\ninternal situation.\"\r\n\r\nThis declaration left great latitude in the making of loans, yet\r\nit did, in fact, acknowledge the appropriateness of the American\r\nposition. I asked Baron Hayashi about it. What exceptions would be\r\nmade? The Baron was not very definite but said _bona fide_ industrial\r\nloans were meant. \"Most decidedly,\" he added in reply to my continued\r\nquestioning, \"I favour the strictest scrutiny of each loan, and mutual\r\ninformation among the governments about such transactions.\" He gave\r\nme plainly to understand that he did not approve, and had opposed,\r\ncertain deals attempted by his countrymen in the semi-official group.\r\nI gathered his thorough disapproval of direct interference by the\r\nmilitary in international affairs; but the military were in power in\r\nJapan, and its diplomats were helpless.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with its main suggestion, the American Government\r\nfollowed with a memorandum about financing China, sent to Great\r\nBritain, France, and Japan. It had already proposed a new consortium,\r\nincluding virtually all parties interested in each national group. The\r\nCurrency Reform Loan should come first, with the shares of the British\r\nand French groups carried by the Americans and Japanese so long as the\r\nformer could not furnish funds. Industrial as well as administrative\r\nloans should be included, and thus removed from the sphere of\r\ndestructive competition.\r\n\r\nThe danger that industrial loans might be converted to political ends\r\nwas patent. Yet in my recommendations I felt it difficult to avoid\r\nevils of monopoly, unless independent enterprises involving loans\r\nshould be admitted.\r\n\r\nThe British and French banking representatives plainly wished to have\r\nAmerica lead in the international financial reorganization of China.\r\nJapan, as its minister often said, desired the United States to reënter\r\nthe Consortium--but he meant the old Consortium, in which Japan had\r\nthe leadership. Japan did not readily take to the idea of the new\r\nConsortium. It declared that it favoured the proposal \"on principle,\"\r\nbut found it necessary to weigh every detail with considerable\r\nminuteness. This caused great delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nA NEW WORLD WAR COMING?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old World War ended with the Armistice. Was a new one looming?\r\n\r\nIf one came it would break in China--of that we were convinced.\r\nUnless it settled China's problems the Peace Conference would fall\r\ndisastrously short of safeguarding the world against a renewal of\r\nits titanic conflict. In China the powers were rivals, each with its\r\njealously guarded sphere of influence. In the extravagant language\r\nof fancy, Ku Hung-ming thus pictured to me the situation: \"China's\r\npolitical ship, built in the eclipse and rigged with curses black, has\r\nbeen boarded by the pirates of the world. In their dark rivalries they\r\nmay scuttle it and all sink together, but not until they have first\r\nplundered and burned civilization as we know it.\"\r\n\r\nShould any action be taken which might be interpreted as a recognition\r\nof a special position for Japan in China, whether in the form of a\r\nso-called Monroe Doctrine or a \"regional understanding\" or in any other\r\nway, forces would be set in motion that in a generation would be beyond\r\ncontrolling. In comparison with this tremendous issue, even the complex\r\nre-alignments of Central Europe fell into relative unimportance. The\r\nsame fatal result was sure to follow any further accentuation of\r\nspheres of influence.\r\n\r\nWe in China realized this, and in deadly earnest we worked out a plan\r\nof joint preventive action by the powers, which would unite them\r\ninstead of leaving them in fatal rivalry. The root of all evil is in\r\nthe love of money. It was local financing by single exploiting powers\r\nin spheres protected by political influence that was the evil. If,\r\ninstead, the finance of the world could be made to back a united\r\nChina, there would be a great constructive development, from which all\r\nwould benefit far in excess of selfish profits garnered in a corner.\r\nWe planned a system of joint international finance. That, despite\r\nits drawbacks, would destroy the localization of foreign political\r\ninfluence. The plan in its relations to the Chinese Government was\r\nworked out with everyone that we could reach competent to give advice.\r\nThere were the official and business representatives of Great Britain\r\nand France; the Chinese cabinet ministers and other officials, and all\r\nof the American representatives, including the commercial attachés\r\nJulean Arnold and P.P. Whitham, and the American advisers, Dr. W.W.\r\nWilloughby, Dr. W.C. Dennis, and Mr. J.E. Baker of the Department of\r\nRailways. Day and night the conferences went on informally; by day and\r\nnight these matters were threshed out. Japanese experts, too, were\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\nThe time seemed propitious. The Armistice brought the hope that the\r\npowers would coöperate. The separatist political aims in China might\r\nbe overcome, together with the sinister intrigue for dismembering or\r\ndominating that mighty nation of freemen. Could foreign financial\r\naction and influence in China be gathered up into a unit? Could it be\r\nmade to build for the whole of China, not tear it down in its several\r\nparts? At all events, we hammered out a plan to make this possible.\r\n\r\nForeigners had gone deeply into railway loans, making their chief\r\ninvestments there. Hence we made the plan of unified financial support\r\napply, first of all, to the railway service. The operating of the\r\ndifferent Chinese lines according to the respective national loans\r\nwas a curse; it was evil politics, and it broke down the railway\r\nservice. Foreign experts, acting as servants of the Chinese Government,\r\nmight unify the Chinese railroads, though of this Liang Shih-yi,\r\nChow Tsu-chi, and Yeh Kung-cho--who knew most about Chinese railway\r\naffairs--had their doubts. It would pile up the overhead expenses, they\r\nthought. The railways could be managed thriftily only by the Chinese.\r\nThe foreign banking interests, too, might try to be depositories for\r\nthe railway funds, as they were already for the customs and salt\r\nrevenues. Thus Chinese capital would pay tribute to foreign capital. If\r\nstill other revenues were thus absorbed, as might be feared, national\r\neconomy would be fettered too much.\r\n\r\nTherefore they proposed a Chinese banking group. It would help in the\r\nfinancing and could be made the depository of funds.\r\n\r\nThese men sympathized, however, with the main purpose of the suggested\r\narrangement for unification. Foreign expertship on the railways, also,\r\nwas highly valued by Chinese railwaymen trained in the West. True,\r\nMr. Sidney Mayers somewhat frightened them by his proposals. This\r\nBritish industrial representative of long experience in China proposed\r\ninternationalizing each separate line by putting on it an international\r\ngroup of experts. The Chinese objected; it would mean giving all the\r\nimportant positions to a large staff of foreign officials. Of this they\r\nhad had enough in the Customs.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to dissociate banking from building; such a union\r\nwould mean monopoly and fierce attacks upon it by all outside\r\ninterests. With the financing separate, the contracting might be left\r\nfree to all competitors, bidding low and resting their bids upon their\r\nrepute and responsibility.\r\n\r\nSo long as it remained possible for different countries to acquire\r\nspecial privileges in distinct spheres, promises of \"integrity and\r\nsovereignty\" would be nothing but empty words. No matter how much they\r\nmight promise that they would not discriminate against the trade of\r\nother nations, the fact remains that established position in itself\r\nconstitutes preference.\r\n\r\nThe favoured nations might more honestly say: \"Give us our special\r\nposition and we will give you all the equal opportunity you ask.\"\r\n\r\nForeign influence could safely be wielded only as a trusteeship\r\nfor China and the world, without any vested political interests or\r\neconomic advantages secured through political pressure. But Chinese\r\nadministration was lax. I urged the Chinese officials to set their\r\nhouse in order, to put their public accounting on an efficient plane;\r\neven if necessary to employ foreign experts to do this. They said:\r\n\"Yes, if the United States will lead,\" for a long record of square\r\ndealing had endeared our business men to the Chinese.\r\n\r\nBut Americans had been slow in China. Two years had fled, and the\r\nGrand Canal was not yet restored as promised. The half million dollars\r\nadvanced had been spent on preliminary surveys. Silver had risen;\r\nAmerican gold bought only one half what it had before. Overhead expense\r\nwas high, and for the preliminary work more than the half-million was\r\nneeded. The Chinese were disappointed, grief-stricken; they began to be\r\nsuspicious.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese-controlled papers redoubled their attacks on Americans.\r\nPretty soon a Japanese journal at Tsinanfu assaulted the name and\r\ncharacter of President Wilson. I had an understanding with my Japanese\r\ncolleague that all press misstatement should be corrected. I saw him\r\nabout this attack on the head of a friendly nation. He promised to\r\nlook into it. After ten days I wrote inquiring again. Under the press\r\nlaws of Japan, he responded, a paper could indeed be punished for\r\nlibellous attack upon the head of a foreign state, provided that such\r\nhead happened to be in Japan at the time. As this paper was notoriously\r\nunder the domination of the Japanese authorities, amenable to their\r\nvery breath and whisper, I failed to see how the minister should find\r\nit hard to bring it to book. I merely called for a retraction where the\r\nJapanese, if a Chinese-owned paper so scurrilously had attacked the\r\nJapanese Emperor, would have asked for total suppression. The Japanese\r\nminister said he would \"further consider the matter\" and would see what\r\nhe could do. A mild apology and retraction were eventually published.\r\n\r\nThe action of the Japanese in China, official and unofficial, during\r\nthe war, had aroused the deepest resentment among the Chinese, who\r\nwere on the verge of despair. The Chinese people were being whirled\r\nin the vortex of old and new. The old organization was beginning to\r\ncrumble; the new had not yet taken shape. It was easy to find spots\r\nof weakness and corruption, aggravation of which would bring about an\r\nactual demoralization of social and political life and the obstruction\r\nof every improvement; bandits could be furnished with arms; weak\r\npersons craving a stimulant could be drugged with morphia; the credit\r\nof native institutions could be ruined; and the most corrupt elements\r\nin the government encouraged. For the original weaknesses and evils the\r\noutside influence was not responsible, but it was culpable for making\r\nthem its instruments for the achievement of its aims of political\r\ndominion.\r\n\r\nA vast system whose object was the drugging of China with morphia,\r\nwhich utilized the petty Japanese hucksters and traders throughout the\r\ncountry, was exposed in the \"opium blacklist\" published by the British\r\npapers in China. Specific proof was adduced in each case. Often the\r\nblacklist extended over two pages of a paper. Obviously these Japanese\r\ndruggists, photographers, and the whole outfit of small-fry traders\r\ncould not traffic in morphia without the connivance of the Japanese\r\nGovernment and the support of semi-official Japanese interests. The\r\nJapanese post offices were used for its distribution in China. Chinese\r\npolice interference with the thousands of Japanese purveyors was ruled\r\nout under the exterritoriality agreements. In Korea, the Japanese opium\r\ngrown officially for \"medicinal uses\" was produced far in excess of\r\nmedicinal needs, and through the ports of Dairen and Tsingtao large\r\nquantities of morphia came into China.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese-controlled press at first answered the blacklist with\r\ncharges of _tu quoque_; but when they defamed the American missionary\r\nhospitals, alleging that they were centres for distributing narcotic\r\ndrugs, nobody among the Chinese paid further attention to them. The\r\nblacklists mapped graphically the thickly sown morphia \"joints\"\r\naround the police station of the Japanese settlement at Tientsin and\r\nthe responsibility was brought home to Japan. An official Japanese\r\nannouncement was evoked that no effort would be spared to stop the\r\n\"regrettable, secret, illicit traffic.\"\r\n\r\nIn Shantung Japanese civil administration had been set up along the\r\nrailway without a scintilla of right. It was later withdrawn for new\r\nconcessions and privileges wrung from the Peking Government. The\r\nJapanese were old masters of this trick. Seize something which you\r\ndo not really want, and restore it to its owner if he will give you\r\nsomething you do want. Then what you want you get, but it is not\r\n\"stolen,\" and can be kept with smug immunity. The arrangements in\r\nShantung were made secretly, riding roughshod over Chinese rights,\r\nand intended to sterilize in advance the enactments of the Peace\r\nConference. If a foreign power should wish to own the Pennsylvania\r\nRailway system, and should actually come into the United States and\r\noccupy it, the parallel would be exact with what Japan did in Shantung.\r\nAfter taking the Shantung Railway and holding it, the Japanese stoutly\r\nclaimed an \"economic right\" to it. The whole course of Japan in China\r\nduring the Great War alarmed both Chinese and foreigners. I may not\r\nname the responsible and fair-minded writer of a letter from which I\r\nquote:\r\n\r\n It would be in the highest degree unfortunate if the present\r\n fortuitous and temporary possession of the Leased Territory and\r\n Shantung Railway by Japan should be confirmed by the final Treaty of\r\n Peace, for not only would China's sovereignty in Shantung be in danger\r\n of impairment, but the trading rights of Chinese, Americans, and\r\n Europeans would undoubtedly be prejudiced.\r\n\r\n Another consideration that has the greatest weight with the writer is\r\n that the principles for which the United States entered the European\r\n War and on behalf of which the United States, in common with the\r\n whole world, has paid an unthinkable price in gold and blood, make\r\n unbearable a continuance, not to say accentuation, of the old system\r\n of foreign intrigue in China. It is unbearable that one result of the\r\n victory bought in part with American lives should be the extension\r\n of Japanese power in China, when such extension means the further\r\n strengthening of the domination of a monarchical and imperialistic\r\n foreign nation over China, a result constituting in its own sphere a\r\n complete negation of the objects for which the United States devoted\r\n its entire resources in the war against Germany.\r\n\r\nDr. Sun Yat Sen wrote me at Shanghai on the 19th of November, referring\r\nboth to internal and external troubles, and the union of militarists,\r\nforeign and Chinese:\r\n\r\n Through you alone will the President and the people of the United\r\n States see the true state of affairs in China. Your responsibility\r\n is indeed great. Whether Democracy or Militarism triumphs in China\r\n largely depends upon Your Excellency's moral support of our helpless\r\n people at this stage.\r\n\r\nThese words show the Chinese belief in the sheer force of public\r\nopinion, and their wish that the Chinese situation be known and\r\nunderstood abroad. This achieved, the evils under which China groans\r\nand travails would shrivel.\r\n\r\nWe built up our solution of unity for China. In carefully weighed\r\ndispatches I sent it to the American Government, and cabled the\r\nPresident a statement of China's vital relation to future peace. I was\r\nconstrained to condemn Japan's policy, quite deliberately, summing up\r\nthe evidence accumulated in the course of five years. I had come to the\r\nFar East admiring the Japanese, friendly to them--my published writings\r\nshow this abundantly. I did not lose my earnest goodwill toward the\r\nJapanese people but I could not shut my eyes to Japanese imperialist\r\npolitics with its unconscionably ruthless and underhanded actions and\r\nits fundamental lack of every idea of fair play. The continuance\r\nof such methods could only bring disaster; their abandonment is a\r\ncondition of peace and real welfare. The aims and methods of Japan's\r\nmilitary policy in the Continent of Asia can bring good to no one,\r\nleast of all to the Japanese people, notwithstanding any temporary\r\ngains. Such ambitions cannot permanently succeed.\r\n\r\nA cure can come only when such evils are clearly recognized.\r\nLip-service to political liberalism might mislead the casually\r\nregardful outside world. To those face to face with what Japanese\r\nmilitarism was doing to continental Asia there was left no doubt of its\r\nsinister quality. Japan herself needs to be delivered from it, for it\r\nhas used the Japanese people, their art and their civilization, for its\r\nown evil ends. More than that, it threatens the peace of the world. If\r\ntalk of \"a better understanding\" presupposes the continuance of such\r\naims and motives as have actuated Japanese political plot during the\r\npast few years, it is futile. What is needed is a change of heart.\r\n\r\nHere is the substance of the memorandum upon which my cablegram to the\r\nPresident was based:\r\n\r\n In 1915, coercion was applied and China was forced by threats to\r\n solidify and extend the privileged position of Japan in Manchuria\r\n and Mongolia and to agree prospectively to a like régime in Shantung\r\n together with the beginnings of a special position in Fukien Province.\r\n After this there was a change of methods although the policy tended to\r\n the same end--domination over China.\r\n\r\n Instead of coercion, Japan applied secret and corrupt influence\r\n through alliance with purchasable officials kept in office by Japanese\r\n support. The latter insidious policy is more dangerous because it gave\r\n the appearance that rights are duly acquired through grant of the\r\n Chinese Government; no demands or ultimatums are necessary because\r\n corrupt officials strongly supported by Japanese finance, acting\r\n absolutely in secret channels, suppressing all public discussion with\r\n the strong arm of the police, are able to deliver contractual rights\r\n regular in form, though of corrupt secret origin and evil tendency.\r\n\r\n Japan has used every possible means to demoralize China by creating\r\n and sustaining trouble; by supporting and financing the most\r\n objectionable elements, particularly a group of corrupt and vicious\r\n military governors akin to bandits in their methods; by employing\r\n instigators of trouble; by protection given to bandits; by the\r\n introduction of morphia and opium; by the corruption of officials\r\n through loans, bribes, and threats; by the wrecking of native banks\r\n and the debauching of local currency; by illegal export of the copper\r\n currency of the people; by local attempts to break down the salt\r\n administration; by persistent efforts to prevent China from going into\r\n the war and then seeing to it that China was never in a position to\r\n render to the common cause such aid as would be in her power and as\r\n she would willingly render if left to herself: finally, by utilizing\r\n the war and the preoccupation of the Allies for enmeshing China in the\r\n terms of a secret military alliance.\r\n\r\n As a result of these methods and manipulations, Japan has gained the\r\n following advantages: a consolidation of her special position in\r\n Manchuria and eastern Mongolia, and the foundation of the same in\r\n Shantung and Fukien; control in the matter of Chinese finance through\r\n the control of the Bank of Communications and the Bureau of Public\r\n Printing and the appointment of a high financial adviser together with\r\n the adoption of the unsound gold-note scheme happily not yet put in\r\n force. She has secured extensive railway concessions in Manchuria,\r\n Shantung, Chihli, and Kiangsu; mining rights in various provinces;\r\n and special monopolistic rights through the Kirin forestry loan, the\r\n telephone loan, and others. Through the secret military convention\r\n Japan attempts not only to control the military policy of China but\r\n incidentally national resources such as iron deposits. All these\r\n arrangements are so secretly made that in most cases not even the\r\n Foreign Office is in possession of the documents relating thereto.\r\n Together with this goes the persistent assertion of special interests\r\n which are interpreted as giving a position of predominance.\r\n\r\n This is a strong indictment and I feel the fullest responsibility in\r\n making these statements. Fundamentally friendly to the Japanese as my\r\n published expressions show, I have been forced through the experience\r\n of five years to the conclusion that the methods applied by the\r\n Japanese military masters can lead only to evil and destruction and\r\n also that they will not be stopped by any consideration of fairness\r\n and justice but only by the definite knowledge that such action will\r\n not be tolerated.\r\n\r\n As a steady stream of information from every American official in\r\n China and from every other source as well as my own experience have\r\n made this conclusion inevitable, I owe the duty to state it to the\r\n American Government in no uncertain terms. Nor is this said in any\r\n spirit of bitterness against the Japanese people but from the\r\n conviction that the policy pursued by their military masters can\r\n in the end bring only misery and woe to them and the world. During\r\n all this period it has not been possible for the European powers\r\n or the United States to do anything for China. The United States,\r\n though assisting all other Allies financially, could not contribute\r\n one dollar toward maintaining the financial independence of China\r\n as undivided attention was needed to the requirements of the west\r\n front. The Lansing-Ishii notes, undoubtedly intended to express a\r\n friendly attitude toward any legitimate aspirations of Japan while\r\n safeguarding the rights of China, were perverted by the Japanese into\r\n an acknowledgment of their privileged position in China. Now at last,\r\n when the pressure has been released, America as well as the European\r\n countries must face the issue which has been created, that is, whether\r\n a vast, peaceable, and industrious population whose most articulate\r\n desire is to be allowed to develop their own life in the direction of\r\n free and just government, shall become material to be moulded by the\r\n secret plottings of a foreign military despotism into an instrument of\r\n its power. If it is said that the aims of Japan are now but economic\r\n and in just response to the needs of Japan's expanding population, it\r\n must be remembered that every advantage is gained and maintained by\r\n political and military pressure and that it is exploited by the same\r\n means in a fashion, taking no account of the rights of other foreign\r\n nations or of the Chinese themselves. Divested of their political\r\n character and military aims the economic activities of Japan would\r\n arouse no opposition.\r\n\r\n Only the refusal to accept the results of Japanese secret manipulation\r\n in China during the last four years, particularly, the establishment\r\n of Japanese political influence and a special privilege position in\r\n Shantung can avert the result of either making China a dependence of a\r\n reckless and boundlessly ambitious military caste which would destroy\r\n the peace of the entire world, or bringing on a military struggle\r\n inevitable from the establishment of rival spheres of interest and\r\n local privilege in China.\r\n\r\n Peace is conditioned on the abolition for the present and future\r\n of all localized privileges. China must be freed from all foreign\r\n political influence exercised within her borders, railways controlled\r\n by foreign governments, and preferential arrangements supported by\r\n political power. If this is done, China will readily master her own\r\n trouble, particularly if the military bandits hitherto upheld by Japan\r\n shall no longer have the countenance of any foreign power.\r\n\r\n The advantages enumerated above were gained by Japan when she was\r\n professedly acting as the trustee of the Associated Powers in the\r\n Far East, and they could not have been obtained at all but for the\r\n sacrifices made by them in Europe. They are therefore not the\r\n exclusive concern of any one power. With respect to Shantung the\r\n German rights there lapsed, together with all Chino-German treaties,\r\n upon the declaration of war. A succession of treaty rights from\r\n Germany to Japan is therefore not possible, and the recognition of\r\n a special position of Japan in Shantung could only proceed from\r\n a new act to which conceivably some weak Chinese officials might\r\n be induced but which would be contrary to the frequently declared\r\n aims of international policy in China and which would amount to the\r\n definitive establishment of exclusive spheres of influence in China\r\n leading in turn to the more vigorous development of such exclusive\r\n spheres by other nations. The present situation of affairs offers the\r\n last opportunity by common consent to avert threatening disaster by\r\n removing the root of conflict in China.\r\n\r\n Never before has an opportunity for leadership toward the welfare\r\n of humanity presented itself equal to that which invites America in\r\n China at the present time. The Chinese people ask for no better fate\r\n than to be allowed freedom to follow in the footsteps of America;\r\n every device of intrigue and corruption as well as coercion is being\r\n employed to force them in a different direction, including constant\r\n misrepresentation of American policies and aims which, however, has\r\n not as yet prejudiced the Chinese. Nor is it necessary for America to\r\n exercise any political influence. If it were only known that America\r\n in concert with the liberal powers would not tolerate the enslavement\r\n of China either by foreign or native militarists the natural\r\n propensity of the Chinese to follow liberal inclinations would guide\r\n this vast country toward free government and propitious development of\r\n peaceful industrial activities, even through difficulties unavoidable\r\n in the transition of so vast and ancient a society to new methods of\r\n action.\r\n\r\n But if China should be disappointed in her confidence at the present\r\n time the consequences of such disillusionment on her moral and\r\n political development would be disastrous, and we instead of looking\r\n across the Pacific toward a peaceable, industrial nation, sympathetic\r\n with our ideals, would be confronted with a vast materialistic\r\n military organization under ruthless control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nJAPAN SHOWS HER TEETH\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Obata had succeeded Baron Hayashi as Japanese minister in\r\nDecember. He was a dour, silent man who had been much in China, as\r\nconsular officer and in the Legation. He had sat with Mr. Hioki in the\r\nconferences in which the twenty-one demands were pressed on China.\r\nHe was known to be a very direct representative, in the diplomatic\r\nservice, of the militarist masters of Japan. His appointment was to\r\nthe Chinese ominous of a continuance of aggressive tactics. A wail of\r\nindignation went up from the Chinese press, but Mr. Obata remained. In\r\nmy personal relations with this secretive man I thought I saw gradually\r\nemerging a broader and more humane outlook.\r\n\r\nThe new Japanese minister called on the 2nd of February, 1919, at\r\nthe Foreign Office and expressed resentment at the attitude of the\r\nChinese delegation at Paris. The Chinese representatives had said they\r\nwere willing to publish all the secret agreements which the diplomacy\r\nof Nippon had been weaving around China. Japan objected. The sacred\r\ntreaties between China and Japan were not to be divulged without the\r\nconsent of both parties. If China was so anxious to purge herself of\r\nsecret diplomacy, let her publish first the agreement of September\r\n24, 1918, which gave the special privileges of Germany in Shantung to\r\nJapan. The displeasure of the Japanese in Paris was reënforced by Mr.\r\nObata in Peking by what the Chinese took to be a veiled threat. \"Great\r\nBritain,\" said he, \"is preoccupied with internal disorders. She cannot\r\nassist China. But Japan is fully able to assist, as she has a navy of\r\n500,000 tons, and an army of more than a million men ready for action.\"\r\n\r\nThe Shantung agreement had been the consummation of the\r\nJapanese-controlled Minister of Communications. The Chinese Foreign\r\nOffice was not consulted when the Chinese minister at Tokyo signed it,\r\nand it had not been ratified by the Chinese Government. The Chinese\r\npeople viewed it merely as a draft, and demanded its cancellation with\r\nthe return to Japan of the moneys received under it by the politicians.\r\n\r\nMr. Obata's threat, which the Chinese took to be an attempt to\r\nintimidate the Chinese delegation at Paris, evoked a deluge of\r\ntelegraphic messages urging the President and the Government by all\r\npossible means to back their delegates. These expressions came from\r\nmen of all parties. Chen Lu, Acting Foreign Minister, tried in vain\r\nto minimize the effect of the interview. Called before the Chamber of\r\nRepresentatives in secret session, he said that the newspaper reports\r\nhad been \"somewhat exaggerated,\" and added: \"In this time when the\r\nright and justice of the Allied Powers have definitely destroyed\r\nmilitarism and despotism, we Chinese, although as yet a weak country,\r\nmay consider every menace of foreign aggression as a thing of the past,\r\nand accept it with a smile.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government at first cabled the Paris delegation not to make\r\nthe secret treaties public; they were not held to be valid by the\r\nChinese Government, and publication might lend them force. Later,\r\nthe Government cabled, leaving it entirely to the discretion of the\r\ndelegates. The diplomatic commission of the Chin Pu Tang recommended\r\nthis. Meanwhile, Mr. Liang Chi-chao had gone to France. He meant to go\r\nby way of the United States, where I had prepared for him an itinerary\r\nand letters of introduction. Then his intimate associate, Tang\r\nHua-lung, was assassinated in Vancouver. Liang, fearful of a similar\r\nfate, went straight to France, evading the Kuo Min Tang sympathizers in\r\nAmerica. Ex-Premier Hsiung Hsi-ling told me that Liang was to inform\r\nthe Chinese delegates unofficially about the state of things in China.\r\n\r\nThis was so bad that the American recommendation that the powers keep\r\ntheir money away from either party until China was reunited looked\r\nmore and more desirable. An influential and responsible Chinese, who\r\ntalked with me about the clique that ran the War Participation Bureau,\r\nmade this statement: \"The danger to China is in the efforts of Tuan's\r\nmilitarists. Japan is giving them money to build up an army. With this\r\nthey will try to overawe the President and force him to fall in with\r\ntheir aims. The negotiations for peace with the south will cease; the\r\nwar with the south will go on.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most burning questions both to private individuals and\r\nthe press was how to oblige Japan and her officials to cease their\r\nsupport of the northern militarists by the sending of money and\r\narms. Certainly a fire was built under them. The Japanese minister\r\ncalled on me on the 9th of January to say that his government would\r\nnow join in a declaration on financial assistance to China. He had\r\nto make reservations about the loan of 20,000,000 yen, pledged in\r\nconnection with the secret military agreement, also as to the so-called\r\n\"industrial\" loans. The secret loan arrangement had been made with\r\nthree Japanese banks: the Bank of Chosen, the Industrial Bank of Japan,\r\nand the Bank of Formosa, by the War Participation Bureau. With this,\r\nthe minister said, he could not interfere. Also, his government was\r\nin principle favouring a restriction of the sale of arms, as America\r\nrecommended; but it would be best for the powers to say nothing\r\nabout it, as their joint statement would be taken as an attempt to\r\nrestrain Japan, which was the only country able to furnish arms to\r\nChina. Besides, the War Participation Bureau had a troublesome private\r\ncontract for arms with the Tayeh Company, which the Government felt it\r\ncouldn't interfere with. So there you are, as Henry James would put it.\r\n\r\nI told the Japanese minister that we were not proposing any platonic\r\narrangement as Americans were both able and willing to furnish arms\r\nto the Chinese under legitimate contracts, if the American Government\r\nwould permit it. Moreover, as to the transaction of those three\r\nJapanese banks--since the Government of Japan had an interest both in\r\nthem and in the munitions company mentioned, their alliance with the\r\nWar Participation Bureau would be dissociated with difficulty in the\r\npublic mind from the Japanese Government.\r\n\r\nThe War Participation Bureau clique was actually getting ready to equip\r\nan army against the south while the North-and-South Peace Conference\r\nwas sitting at Shanghai. Tang Shao-yi, chief peace representative of\r\nthe south, formally remonstrated to the British minister, as dean of\r\nthe diplomatic corps, against such doings of this \"Bureau\" and its\r\nJapanese support.\r\n\r\nNow, the Bureau had been established as its name implied, to facilitate\r\nparticipation of China in the Great War. Japan's financial support\r\nof it was ostensibly given also in behalf of the other Allies. If it\r\nwere to be prostituted to the fomenting of civil war the others as\r\nwell could not escape responsibility. A meeting was held on the 12th\r\nof February by the Allied and Associated ministers. Several strongly\r\nurged that outside money continually given for recruiting of troops was\r\nopposed to the aim of restoring settled conditions in China and to the\r\npolicy of the joint declaration of December. The Japanese minister was\r\nsilent. He said he must await instructions.\r\n\r\nHe informed me on February 21st that Japan had called a halt on the\r\nshipping of ammunition and equipment to the War Participation Bureau,\r\nbut the payment of the balance of the loan could not be stopped. Just\r\nthen, as it happened, an American firm would soon be ready to begin\r\ndelivery of a certain amount of equipment in China, contracted for in\r\ngood faith during the previous August. America had proposed a joint\r\ndeclaration against the furnishing of arms, which Japan had blocked. As\r\nthe declaration had not been made, I could not then stop the American\r\ndelivery though I did so later. But America would still be only too\r\nglad to join in the declaration as proposed.\r\n\r\nAs the Japanese were still paying the loan funds into the War\r\nParticipation Bureau, another diplomatic \"indignation meeting\" was\r\nheld about it on March 6th. The Japanese minister said his banks could\r\nnot help paying over those funds, but he had suggested to the Chinese\r\nGovernment that it might be well, in the circumstances, to refrain from\r\ndrawing the money; Japan could not object to this. Forthwith one of the\r\nministers spoke up: \"Then let us all make this recommendation which\r\nJapan has made.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the Japanese minister was taken aback, almost shocked. He had\r\nalways argued that the War Participation Bureau was a Chinese internal\r\naffair, not one in which the powers that had helped form it should\r\npresume to dip. But the suggestion was quickly adopted. As a result,\r\nthe representatives of Great Britain, France, Italy, and the United\r\nStates, all solemnly called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nexpressing their opinion that to draw the war participation funds was\r\nnot advisable, as it constituted an obstacle to internal peace.\r\n\r\nBut Japan's advice had been merely for the record, not at all to\r\nbe acted upon. Soon there came over to Sir John Jordan an informal\r\nmemorandum from the Foreign Office, taking the Japanese line of thought\r\nthat the War Participation Bureau was China's internal affair. It\r\nmight be construed as an intimation that we were meddling. Indeed, two\r\nChinese of high position told me that the President and the Premier had\r\nheld up the memorandum for several days for fear that it might give\r\noffense, until the Minister of War absolutely insisted upon its being\r\nsent.\r\n\r\nThrough these two men I sent a quiet intimation to the President that\r\nwithdrawal of the memorandum would prevent unpleasant feelings among\r\nmen who were sincerely friendly to him and to China. The memorandum was\r\npulled back without delay; thereupon all the Chinese officials, except\r\nthe few directly connected with the War Participation Bureau, rejoiced.\r\n\r\nThe five representatives who signed the original declaration of\r\nDecember met again on the 11th of March, because the French minister\r\nhad instructions favouring action upon the Bureau. The Japanese\r\nminister advanced his arguments about its being China's business,\r\nnot ours. But the others took the view that as it was an Allied war\r\ninstitution and Japan had dealt directly with it, it was quasi-external\r\nin character. \"Is it not quite clear,\" protested the Japanese minister,\r\n\"that the loan was purely a commercial affair, made by certain banks,\r\nand not controlled by the Japanese Government?\" How, then, it was asked\r\nin reply, does it happen that in connection with this loan, officers of\r\nthe Japanese army had been assigned to the War Participation Bureau as\r\nadvisers and instructors; was it customary to make such extraordinary\r\narrangements in connection with a purely commercial transaction?\r\n\r\n\"I am not sufficiently informed,\" Mr. Obata responded evasively. \"I\r\nshall have to refer to the reports of these transactions.\"\r\n\r\nThe position of Japan in this matter was so patently equivocal that\r\nit was amusing. We decided that we should make it plain that as this\r\nbureau was created to further our common purposes, we could not\r\nacquiesce in any political action or in the use of any money which\r\nwould tend to prolong internal strife.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese minister on the 1st of March had notified the Chinese\r\nGovernment that no further deliveries of arms would be made to the War\r\nParticipation Bureau pending the termination of the North-and-South\r\nPeace Conference at Shanghai. We proposed to follow this up with joint\r\naction. Certain representatives were uninstructed, though they favoured\r\nfrowning on the arms imports. Finally eight powers united \"effectively\r\nto restrain their subjects and citizens from importing into China arms\r\nand munitions of war until the establishment of a government whose\r\nauthority is recognized throughout the whole country.\" This included\r\nthe delivery of arms under contracts already made but not executed. I\r\ncould then warn the American firm not to execute its contract for the\r\ntime being, and I did so.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, since the early spring of 1918, Baron Sakatani,\r\nJapanese ex-Minister of Finance, had been in Peking. Mr. Liang\r\nChi-chao, when as Minister of Finance he made his Japanese loans, had\r\nheld out the possibility of the appointment of a Japanese financial\r\nadvisor. The Baron was an old acquaintance of mine and I held him\r\nin high regard; but, in view of the fact that I could not consider\r\nthis time a proper one for settling the matter of the financial\r\nadvisorships, I had to distinguish between my personal feelings for him\r\nand the official stand which I might have to take. A Japanese friend\r\nwrote me in connection with Baron Sakatani's visit to China: \"A section\r\nof our capitalists have been given every facility to make money and\r\nto lend it to China; with the money squeezed from them, the military\r\nbureaucrats have been corrupting party men and sending them to China\r\nand elsewhere, to exploit the warring nations while they are busy with\r\nthe war. The civilian officials and militarists cannot think anything\r\nexcept in terms of German fear or admiration. If such Japanese are\r\nemployed by the Peking government, it will forever alienate Chinese\r\nsympathies from anything we may propose.\"\r\n\r\nBaron Sakatani from the first had nursed the ambition of being made\r\ncurrency adviser to the Chinese Government; by January, 1919, it\r\nappeared that his wish was to be fulfilled. The Japanese minister\r\nannounced that the other nations had agreed to the Baron's appointment.\r\nI had not agreed to it. I had heard nothing whatever about it and had\r\nconsistently and energetically opposed any action of this sort. I\r\nconsidered that it would permanently determine the course to be taken\r\nwith regard to currency loans, and would preclude the possibility of\r\nany consultation with the United States. I requested the Minister of\r\nFinance to defer the appointment until I could consult my government.\r\nThe next development came on the 20th when the Japanese minister\r\nhanded me a memorandum which referred to the personal goodwill I had\r\nexpressed to Baron Hayashi and which went on to state that the proposed\r\nappointment of Baron Sakatani had been sanctioned by Mr. Lansing in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nI cabled to Washington, receiving therefrom on the 30th instructions\r\nsaying that the appointment of a currency adviser should be settled\r\nonly after full consultation by all concerned, and that Mr. Lansing had\r\nnot committed himself to any other understanding. I sent a note to the\r\nMinister of Finance, stating that as one of the parties to the Currency\r\nLoan Agreement, the United States wished that action be postponed\r\nuntil further consideration could be given. I was immediately assured\r\nthat the position taken would be considered as final. As a personal\r\nfriend I regretted that Baron Sakatani could not be retained, but in\r\nso important a matter it was impossible to stand aside while action\r\nwas rushed through which would be prejudicial to the long-established\r\ninterests of the powers who were, at the time, preoccupied with\r\nafter-war problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nBANDITS, INTRIGUERS, AND A HOUSE DIVIDED\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a phase of Chinese life which I should touch upon if the\r\npicture I am trying to give of the China I knew is to be complete.\r\n\r\nBrigandage is an established institution in China, where it has\r\noperated so long that people have become accustomed to it and take\r\nit for granted as a natural visitation. At this time there was a\r\nvicious circle around which brigands and troops and rich citizens and\r\nvillagers were travelling, one in pursuit of the other. The brigands\r\nwere recruited from disbanded soldiers--men who had lost connection\r\nwith their family and clan. Often their families had been wiped out\r\nby famine, flood, or disease, or had been killed in the revolution.\r\nAt other times the individual may have lost touch through a fault\r\nof his own causing him to be cast out. It is very difficult for an\r\nisolated person, without family and clan connections, to reëstablish\r\nhimself. The easiest way is to enlist in the army. If that cannot be\r\ndone, he becomes a brigand. Brigands foregather in provinces where the\r\nadministration is lax or in remote regions difficult to reach. They lie\r\nin ambush and seize wealthy persons, who are carried off to the hills\r\nand released only when ransom is paid. In this way, a considerable\r\ntax is levied on accumulated wealth. This money the brigands spend\r\namong the villagers where they happen to be. Meanwhile, the Provincial\r\nGovernor bethinks himself that a certain brigade or division has\r\nnot been paid for a long time and therefore might cause trouble,\r\nso he announces what is called a \"country cleansing campaign.\" The\r\nsituation is so intolerable that the general sees himself forced to\r\ngo to extremes, and to send his troops with orders to exterminate the\r\nbrigands. They proceed to the infested regions; the brigands, having\r\nmeanwhile got wind of these movements, depart for healthier climes,\r\nleaving the troops to quarter themselves on the villagers, who are by\r\nthem relieved of the money which they have made out of the brigands.\r\nSome brigands may be unfortunate enough to be caught; some will be shot\r\nas an example, and others will be allowed to enlist. When the soldiers\r\nhave dwelt for a while among the villagers, they report that the\r\nbands have now been fully suppressed and that the country is cleaned.\r\nThey are then recalled to headquarters; their general reports to the\r\ngovernor, and is appropriately rewarded. Meanwhile, the brigands return\r\nfrom their safer haunts and begin again to catch wealthy people, whom\r\nthey relieve of their surplus liquidable property. And so the circle\r\nrevolves interminably.\r\n\r\nA little more efficiency in China would deliver it of much of its\r\nintriguing and all of its banditry. Returning to Peking from a trip\r\nto the Philippines I found that Mr. Kyle, an American engineer on the\r\nSiems-Carey railway survey, and Mr. Purcell, another employé, had been\r\nseized by bandits in a remote part of Honan. The bandits took a large\r\nsum of silver these men were carrying to pay off the surveying parties\r\nfarther up toward Szechuan, then they decided to hold Kyle and Purcell\r\nfor ransom.\r\n\r\nDoctor Tenney, the Chinese secretary, was in Kaifengfu, stirring up\r\nthe provincial governor to hurry the release of the men. The company\r\nwas quite ready to pay the ransom, and I could easily have induced\r\nthe Chinese Government to pay it. I was advised that this would be\r\nthe only certain way of rescuing the men, but I felt it would be\r\na dangerous precedent; as the bandits would then go on taking and\r\nholding foreigners for ransom. Mr. Kyle was neither young nor robust.\r\nI feared for the strenuous life and the worry he was undergoing, but\r\nwaited two weeks for the Central and the Provincial Government, which\r\nI made responsible, to get them back. One night, Mr. Purcell escaped.\r\nI then through Doctor Tenney notified the Governor-General that he\r\nmust surround the entire region where the bandits were, telling them\r\nemphatically that if anything happened to Mr. Kyle the band would be\r\nhunted down and exterminated.\r\n\r\nThe threat was \"got across\" to the bandits, and with it a promise that\r\nthose instrumental in restoring the captive would escape punishment\r\nand in some way be rewarded. After a week's further suspense Mr.\r\nKyle was delivered to the pursuing troops and forthwith returned to\r\nPeking. The chief of the band was rewarded with a commission in the\r\narmy; his henchmen were enlisted as soldiers. But those who had no\r\npart in the delivery were one by one caught and executed. So, in the\r\nend, a salutary example was set to keep bandits from interfering with\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\nMr. Kyle moved with the band every night in their mountainous and\r\ninaccessible region. Over divides they went from valley to valley. Mr.\r\nKyle kept his normal health, but complained that they had not let him\r\nsleep. He snored so loudly, the bandits told him, that they feared he\r\nwould attract the notice of the troops; so, during the final ten days,\r\nhe had not had a solid hour of sleep. But he made up his mind that he\r\nwould keep his mental equipoise and his physical fitness in order to\r\nlive through the experience.\r\n\r\nTwo woman missionaries had been taken at about the same time by bandits\r\nin Shantung Province. But they were released after a few days. The\r\nmissionaries of the society they belonged to circulated a pamphlet\r\nsomewhat later, pointing out the superior efficacy of prayer over\r\ndiplomatic intervention. In response to prayer these two teachers had\r\nbeen freed within a week; whereas all our diplomatic efforts had not\r\nyet secured the release of the American engineer.\r\n\r\nFear of foreign displeasure lost the Chinese the chance to get the\r\nservices of a great engineer. Before going to the Philippines I had\r\nbeen visited by Mr. Ostrougoff, Minister of Railways in Kerensky's\r\ntime, who had inaugurated the Russian agreement under which Mr. John\r\nF. Stevens was given the task of helping to reorganize the Russian\r\nrailways. The work had been prevented by disturbed conditions. Admiral\r\nKolchak, together with Alexis Staal, had also called on me, with\r\nothers who had faith in the beginnings of a representative political\r\norganization in Siberia. I recall Kolchak's fine, serious face, and his\r\nmanner which was that of a man under the strain imposed by duties that\r\ntranscend any mere personal interest. On my return, John F. Stevens\r\ncame to Peking for a month. He was discouraged by the Russian and\r\nSiberian situation. The general breakdown, the social revolution, and\r\nthe establishment of soviets had demolished the chances for carrying\r\nout his railway plans in Russia. No organized authority had backed\r\nhim. In Peking he studied the Chinese railway situation. In his quiet,\r\nthorough-going way, he looked into the whole question for China; it was\r\nnot long before he had great confidence in its possibilities. I felt\r\nit would be a godsend if a man of his genius for original planning and\r\nconstructive work, proved in the great Panama Canal project; a man,\r\nmoreover, who had intimate experience of American railway operation,\r\ncould work out with the Chinese a systematic plan for developing their\r\nrailway service. The Chinese would have eagerly welcomed this chance,\r\nbut they were not free. The engagement of one foreigner would have\r\nbrought demands to employ many more.\r\n\r\nThis was in the spring of 1918. I called on Mr. Liang Shih-yi to greet\r\nhim on his return from exile. \"The urgent thing,\" he said, \"is to\r\nput a stop to military interference with the civil government. The\r\nquestion of a parliament is not quite so important, but, as it has been\r\nput to the fore, it must be solved first. My solution is to elect a\r\nnew parliament under the old law. Then reduce the army and separate\r\nmilitary from civilian affairs.\"\r\n\r\nLiang described to me the characteristics of the nine chief southern\r\nleaders. They were rivals, they had their hostilities; no three leaders\r\nwould agree. Two would come to an understanding, and the rest would\r\nturn and rend them. Finally, he predicted that Hsu Shih-chang would be\r\nthe most likely candidate for President, Tuan having declined.\r\n\r\nIn Hunan the northern and southern troops were still fighting and\r\ninflicting suffering on the people there; General Chang Chin-yao,\r\nin particular, an opium-smoking gambler and corrupter, the military\r\ngovernor of Hunan; his troops destroyed certain property belonging to\r\nmissionaries. American and British residents of Changsha, the capital,\r\npetitioned the British and American ministers for protection to foreign\r\nlife and property. I had learned that the governor put no bridle on\r\nhis troops. With my British and Japanese colleagues I insisted that\r\ncommanding officers be held personally and individually responsible\r\nfor injuries to foreigners. We pointed out that Chang, especially,\r\nwas under observation. The Minister for Foreign Affairs delivered\r\na warning, and Admiral Knight, whom I had fully advised, ordered a\r\ngunboat to Changsha.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the War Participation Bureau, created to aid the Associated\r\nPowers in the Great War, was watched by Japan. Because of it they made\r\ntheir special military convention of which General Tuan had spoken\r\nto me, using the revolution in Russia and the rise of Bolshevism as\r\ntheir pretext. The Japanese militarist element in the Government was\r\nactive and urgent, and General Aoki at Peking and General Tanaka at\r\nTokyo were leaving no stone unturned to aid them. They sought at first\r\na general military alliance. The Chinese would not consider anything\r\nso sweeping. Then the unrest in Siberia was made the basis of more\r\nlimited coöperation. In March a preliminary entente was formed; China\r\nand Japan would consider in common the measures to be taken to cope\r\nwith the Russian situation and to take part in the present war, and the\r\nmeans and conditions of coöperation would be arranged by the military\r\nand naval authorities of both countries.\r\n\r\nWar participation in general was thus put into the purview of mutual\r\nagreement between Japan and China. While no general military alliance\r\nwas concluded, nevertheless the Japanese could now control what was to\r\nbe done by China in the war. It meant that China would do nothing.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the military and naval conventions on methods of\r\ncoöperating, concluded the 16th of May, flexibly permitted Japan in\r\ncertain circumstances to control Chinese railways and resources. The\r\nwhole thing was managed secretly. The public became suspicious of the\r\nresults, since the chief arrangements were made not by the cabinet or\r\nthe Foreign Office, but by the military and naval representatives.\r\nWould China longer freely coöperate with the other Allies? Would she\r\nnot be under Japan's strict leadership? Was not this the entering wedge\r\nfor a complete control of Chinese military affairs by Japan? Would not\r\nChinese militarism be strengthened and made obedient to Japanese policy?\r\n\r\nJapan's acts in Shantung gave these questions pertinence. There she was\r\nexpropriating by eminent domain; in Tsingtau the Japanese authorities\r\nthus acquired about twelve square miles of land, including the shore\r\nof Kiaochow Bay for several miles, which gave control of every land\r\napproach and every possible steamship and railway terminal in this\r\nport. Plainly, Japan was carrying out a policy of permanent occupation.\r\n\r\nWhile the Chino-Japanese entente was being negotiated,\r\nJapanese-controlled papers in China were preaching enmity to the white\r\nrace. In May a Japanese parliamentary party visited China, making\r\nspeeches calculated to stir racial feeling. The burden of the appeals\r\nwas that, after the war, European nations would try to fasten their\r\ncontrol more firmly on China, hence the yellow race should now unite in\r\ntimely opposition.\r\n\r\nMr. Nishihara, close associate of the Japanese Premier, General\r\nTerauchi, was unofficially doing the financial business of Japan in\r\nChina. The Japanese Legation could deny that negotiations were going\r\non, while Japanese interests were actively influencing the financial\r\nmeasures of the Peking Government. A large loan was proposed, to be\r\nsecured on the tobacco and wine revenues. They were the security for\r\nthe existing American loan, with option for further advances. I asked\r\nTsao Ju-lin, Minister of Finance, about this and his answer was: \"The\r\nUnited States is not giving to China the assistance she gives to her\r\nother associates in the war. The American bankers have not completed\r\ntheir contract. It is necessary for China to look elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Tsao said he would at any time consider American proposals and give\r\nthem as favourable treatment as to any other nation. I asked assurances\r\nthat before anything further was done on the basis of the tobacco and\r\nwine revenues, the American bank have a chance to consider a proposal\r\nfrom the Chinese Government under its option. The minister had denied\r\nthat the revenues were now in any way involved; but at this request he\r\nsidestepped. I made the most of his denial, placing it on record in a\r\nnote to the Foreign Office. The French minister took action similar\r\nto mine. Tsao was not only Minister of Finance; he was concurrently\r\nMinister of Communications. Both departments, therefore, were under the\r\nthumb of Japan.\r\n\r\nI have rather rapidly sketched the state of affairs within China up\r\nto July of 1918. I wished a personal discussion of the situation\r\nwith the officials at Washington--my first since America's entrance\r\ninto the war. I left Peking for the United States after another long\r\ninterview with General Tuan, who had become Premier. On June 27th the\r\nPremier stated to me his policy and motives with frankness. \"If we stop\r\nmilitary action,\" he said, \"that would be interpreted as weakness. The\r\nsouth would only make more extravagant demands, and further encroach on\r\nnorthern territory. Force that is adequate--that answers the question.\r\nFor this we need money. If home revenues are not enough, then we must\r\nhave foreign loans. That will restore national unity, which, in turn,\r\nwill make repayment easy. The army will be reformed. The people will\r\nget protection, and the country will prosper.\"\r\n\r\nThis policy was wise, inevitable, he thought. But it suited a class of\r\ninept generals who systematically made war at home, with only moderate\r\nrisk of actual fighting. Their methods involved money more than\r\nbayonets.\r\n\r\n\"When you return from America,\" Tuan said at parting, \"everything will\r\nbe settled, and the south will recognize our authority.\"\r\n\r\nA sea-borne war expedition, sent to conquer the south, was in his mind.\r\nI could not but express my conviction of the impossibility of such an\r\nachievement but he was obstinate.\r\n\r\nI divided my time in America between Washington and New York, save for\r\na visit to my mother. In four weeks I saw representatives of most of\r\nthe great interests, public and private, involved in China. I by no\r\nmeans stopped with the State Department. I saw the Secretary of War\r\nand the Adjutant General, on questions dealing with the recruiting\r\nof troops to be stationed in China; the Intelligence Division of the\r\nWar Department and of the Navy, as well as the Committee on Public\r\nInformation; the Secretary of Commerce, and officials of the War\r\nTrade Board and War Industries Board, about restrictions on commerce\r\nand American commercial developments in China, together with the men\r\nof the Shipping Board about trans-Pacific lines. Among great private\r\norganizations I conferred with members of the National City Bank; J.P.\r\nMorgan & Company; the Guaranty Trust Company of New York; Kuhn, Loeb &\r\nCompany; the General Electric and American Locomotive companies; the\r\nStandard Oil Company of New York; the International Banking Corporation\r\nand American International Corporation; the Chase National Bank;\r\nthe Siems-Carey Company; Pacific Development Corporation, and the\r\nContinental & Commercial Bank of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe American policy with respect to Russia and Siberia had not been\r\ndetermined, and in interviews with President Wilson the Siberian\r\nproblem, to which I had been very close, as well as Chinese finance,\r\nwere subjects of particular attention. I showed to the President how\r\nthe Chinese got loans for alleged industrial purposes; then, with the\r\nconnivance of the lenders, instead of building railways and telephone\r\nsystems, they diverted them to political or partisan ends. Thus Chinese\r\ncredit and the authority of the Government were progressively weakened.\r\nThen foreigners would encroach, and in some fields American opportunity\r\nwas in danger of being restricted or lost entirely. I wished to see\r\nthe United States backing financially a sound programme of Chinese\r\nreorganization. That would accord with our traditions. But jealousies\r\nand friction were to be eliminated, hence I favoured the forming of an\r\nInternational Public Loan Consortium.\r\n\r\nThis would support the credit of the Chinese Government and put Chinese\r\nfinance on a sound basis. Such a consortium would claim priority in\r\nmaking all administrative or political loans; but monopoly should\r\nbe avoided by leaving contracts for building and supplies open to\r\ncompetition, and by letting outside financiers make industrial loans.\r\nOf course, the Consortium as the chief backer of China should have full\r\ninformation about industrial loans, and each government should engage\r\nto scrutinize all loans made by its nationals for industries. All this,\r\nat his request, went to the President in a memorandum submitted on the\r\n14th of August.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Siberia and Russia, my information led me to believe\r\nthat the Russian people might still be influenced to remain friendly\r\nto the Allies, so as to prevent the growth of German control. I had in\r\nmind, not intervention, but economic assistance. I urged a commission\r\nthat would aid the Russian people to import the commodities they\r\nneeded most. The Russian Coöperative societies were anxious for just\r\nsuch assistance; thus, their leaders believed, further unfavourable\r\ndevelopments could be prevented. I knew the Russians to be universally\r\nfriendly; any movement initiated by America would be received with\r\nextreme goodwill.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson seemed to wish something like this to be carried\r\nout. He even discussed with me what men were most likely to succeed\r\nin organizing so huge an enterprise. But he feared to place a\r\nrepresentative of \"big business\" in such a position; men would suspect\r\nselfish national motives. I felt that he wished America to lead in\r\ngiving the Russian people such aid in reorganizing their economic life\r\nas would permanently benefit them and preserve them for our common\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nAfter many, many departments and boards were consulted, I found they\r\nwere not thinking of China. Their chief problem was to train the\r\nAmerican army and transport it to the western front. They did not care\r\nto get Chinese contingents there. This was the critical moment of\r\nthe war. By comparison other interests shrivelled. As for financial\r\nadvances to China, the Government found that China entered the war\r\nafter the law authorizing advances was passed. A new law would be\r\nneeded. To propose it would bring up the whole question of war policy.\r\nThe temper of the day was to concentrate every effort on the greatest\r\nimmediate show of strength on the west front. I appreciated all this,\r\nbut I deeply regretted that a tiny rivulet out of the vast streams of\r\nfinancial strength directed to Europe could not pass to China. Even\r\none thousandth part of the funds given to Europe, invested in building\r\nup China, would have prevented many disheartening and disastrous\r\ndevelopments. For every dollar tenfold in value would have been gained\r\nin fortifying Chinese ability to help in the war and in the post-bellum\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nYOUNG MEN IN PEKING, OLD MEN IN PARIS\r\n\r\n\r\nA crowd of students appeared before the legation gate on the 5th of May\r\nclamouring to see me. I was absent, that day, on a trip to the temple\r\nabove Men Tou-kou and so missed seeing them. Their demonstration, as\r\nit turned out afterward, was the first step in the widespread student\r\nmovement which was to make history. Their patriotic fervour had, on\r\nthat morning, been brought to the boiling point by the first inkling of\r\nthe Paris decision on Shantung.\r\n\r\nThe first reaction of the Chinese people as a whole to this news was\r\none of dumb dismay. It was a stunning, paralyzing blow. It seemed\r\nthat all the brazen intrigue through which Japan had been seeking to\r\nstrengthen her hold on Shantung, all the cunning by which she had\r\nprepared the basis of her claim to permanent possession of the German\r\nrights, had been endorsed by the Versailles Conference.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese people, discouraged in Peking, had centred their hopes on\r\nParis. When hints of a possible acceptance of Japan's demands were\r\nreceived in Peking, the first impulse of the students was to see the\r\nAmerican minister, to ask him whether this news was true, and to see\r\nwhat he had to say. I escaped a severe ordeal.\r\n\r\nWhen they were told that I was absent there was at first a hum of\r\nvoices, then came the cry: \"To the house of the traitor!\" They meant\r\nthe house of Tsao Ju-lin, where the schemers had assembled to make the\r\ncontracts which China hated. Tsao Ju-lin, the smooth little plotter\r\nwhom most people regarded as the guiding spirit of the humiliating\r\nbusiness, was the most despised; but they associated with him Chang\r\nChing-hsiang, who had been Chinese minister at Tokyo when the secret\r\ntreaties were drawn up. The students rushed over to the house and\r\nbroke down the door and trooped inside. They found both men there. No\r\ntime was lost, either on the part of the students or their prey. The\r\nstudents breaking up chairs and tables and using pieces of them for\r\nweapons went after the two diplomats. Tsao, still smooth and slippery,\r\nmanaged to escape through a window and into a narrow alley where he\r\neluded his pursuers. Chang, however, was beaten into insensibility.\r\nLu Tsung-yu, the other plotter whom the students would have \"treated\r\nrough\", was not to be found.\r\n\r\nFor four days we were without foreign news. The first brief telegraphic\r\nintimation of the Paris decision was followed by the cutting of the\r\nwires; Japanese agents, the people surmised, did this to prevent the\r\nuniversal Chinese protest from influencing the decision or causing its\r\nreview.\r\n\r\nPrimarily the cause of the student violence lay in the proximity of the\r\nfourth anniversary of the Japanese ultimatum of 1915; but they were\r\nalso anxious and stirred because of the reported action of the old men\r\nat Paris.\r\n\r\nWhile other telegraphic communication was cut off I got information of\r\nwhat was actually done by wireless. I found it hard to believe that\r\nPresident Wilson would be compliant to the Japanese demands, in View\r\nof the complete and insistent information the American Government had\r\nhad from me and all other American officials in China as to what would\r\nresult from such action. The Shantung decision constituted a wrong\r\nof far-reaching effect; no general benefits bestowed by a league of\r\nnations could outweigh it. Indeed, as I stated to the Government, it\r\ndestroyed all confidence in a league of nations which had such an ugly\r\nfact as its cornerstone.\r\n\r\nTo any one who had watched, day by day, month by month, the\r\nunconscionable plotting for these claims, the decision was a lamentable\r\ndenial of every principle put forward during the war. President Wilson\r\nbrushed aside the unanimous opinion of the American experts, it would\r\nseem, for two reasons: first, he believed that if only the League were\r\nestablished, all difficulties of detail could easily be resolved; and,\r\nsecond, he had not given enough attention to the Shantung question to\r\nrealize that this was not a matter of detail, but a fundamental issue.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson tried to make himself and others believe that with the\r\nacceptance of the Treaty and Covenant, the Shantung question would be\r\nsolved through fulfilment by Japan of its promise \"to restore Shantung\r\nPeninsula to China with full sovereignty,\" reserving only economic\r\nrights. This was his primary misconception. The ownership by a foreign\r\ngovernment of a trunk railway reaching from a first-class port to\r\nthe heart of China could not be correctly termed an economic right.\r\nPolitical control of such \"economic rights\" was exactly what American\r\npolicy had tried to prevent for decades. The President submitted, also,\r\nin the apparent fear that Japanese delegates might follow the lead of\r\nthe Italians and leave the Conference. Colonel House, it appears, was\r\nfrightened into this belief and communicated it to President Wilson;\r\nthe two believed the League was endangered, and that every sacrifice\r\nmust be made to save it.\r\n\r\nThe fear was quite unfounded. I had seen indications enough, of which\r\nI had told the Government, that the Japanese set enormous store upon\r\ntheir membership in the Conference and their position in Paris. As a\r\nmilitary, naval, and financial power, Japan could certainly not be put\r\nin the first class, notwithstanding the tactical advantages which the\r\nwar had brought her. She would never forego the first-class status\r\nbestowed by the arrangements of the Peace Conference. The Japanese had\r\nnot the remotest idea of throwing these advantages to the wind. The\r\nimpression they produced on Colonel House simply proved their capacity\r\nfor bluffing. Had President Wilson taken the trouble to understand\r\nthe situation, he could without difficulty, by the use of friendly\r\nfirmness, have secured a very different solution. As a matter of fact,\r\nit is now well known that the Japanese were ready to agree to an\r\narrangement whereby the German rights in China should accrue to the\r\nAllied and Associated Powers jointly with an early reversion to China.\r\n\r\nProbably nowhere else in the world had expectations of America's\r\nleadership at Paris been raised so high as in China. The Chinese\r\ntrusted America, they trusted the frequent declarations of principle\r\nuttered by President Wilson, whose words had reached China in its\r\nremotest parts. The more intense was their disappointment and\r\ndisillusionment due to the decisions of the old men that controlled\r\nthe Peace Conference. It sickened and disheartened me to think how the\r\nChinese people would receive this blow which meant the blasting of\r\ntheir hopes and the destruction of their confidence in the equity of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nIn the universal despair I feared a revulsion of feeling against\r\nAmerica; not because we were more to blame than others for the unjust\r\ndecision, but because the Chinese had entertained a deeper belief in\r\nour power, influence, and loyalty to principle. They would hardly\r\nunderstand so abject and complete a surrender. Foreign papers, also,\r\nplaced the chief responsibility on the United States. The British in\r\nChina felt that their government had been forced into the unfortunate\r\nsecret agreements with Japan when it could not help itself, because of\r\nthe German danger and the difficulties Japan might raise by going over\r\nto the other side. The United States, whose hands were free, could have\r\nsaved us all, they said, by insisting on the right solution. They had\r\nreally hoped for this; their saying so now in their editorials and in\r\nprivate conversation was in no spirit of petty hostility, but they had\r\nto give vent to their feelings. I feared the Chinese might feel that\r\nthey had been betrayed in the house of their friends, but they met the\r\nblow with sturdy spirit. They never wounded my feelings by anything\r\napproaching an upbraiding of the United States for the part that\r\nPresident Wilson played at Paris. They expressed to me their terrible\r\ndejection, but said merely that President Wilson must have encountered\r\nvery great difficulties which they could know nothing about.\r\n\r\nThey all knew, of course, that the case of China had been weakened\r\nby the treaties made through the connivance of Tsao Ju-lin and his\r\nassociates in the fall of 1918. Their resentment was turned toward\r\nJapan, which had thus taken advantage of the war and the weakness of\r\nChina, and against the Chinese politicians who had become Japan's tools.\r\n\r\nThe Americans in China, as well as the British and the Chinese, were\r\ndeeply dejected during these difficult weeks. From the moment America\r\nentered the war there had been a triumphant confidence that all this\r\nsacrifice and suffering would establish just principles of world\r\naction, under which mankind could live more happily and in greater\r\nsecurity. That hope was now all but crushed.\r\n\r\nIn commemoration of the soldier dead, the American community gathered\r\non May 30th, Decoration Day. It fell to me to make the address, in\r\nwhich I spoke of those recently stationed in Peking who had died during\r\nthe war. Especially, I spoke of the fruitful career of Major Willard\r\nStraight. It was remarkable how many officers of the Marine Guard\r\nrecently in Peking had gone through the brunt of the war and had been\r\ndistinguished in their service. I spoke of General Neville, General\r\nBowley, Commander Hutchins, Colonel Newell, and Colonel Holcombe, all\r\nof whom had been in the thick of it, and rejoiced in their record and\r\nthe fact that though they passed through the valley of death they had\r\nbeen spared. My eyes often rested on the sad face of Mrs. Deering,\r\ntransfigured with the mother's pride in that heroic son whose war\r\nletters, published by her, are one of the intimately human memorials of\r\nthe great struggle.\r\n\r\nI was impressed with how inadequately this wonderful country of\r\nChina and the promise of its people were understood in America. I\r\nknew the difficulties and dangers to be overcome there, and I felt\r\nthat Americans well-disposed toward China would take a hand in its\r\ndevelopment. But the \"folks back home,\" especially the interests that\r\ncontrolled the economic life of America, remained blind and deaf,\r\nlavishing their money in Europe.\r\n\r\nI had spent my energies freely, withholding assistance from none who\r\ndeserved it, although I could easily have limited my official action\r\nwithin narrower and more convenient bounds. In developments that would\r\nmean a slow lift of this fine old civilization to a modern plane real\r\nAmerican interests had come in. Foundations had been laid in the\r\nCanal Contract, the China Medical Board, the railway concessions, the\r\ncreation of a Chino-American bank, and many other enterprises. America\r\nstood no longer with empty hands; she could not be confronted with the\r\ngibe so often used before: \"It is easy for you to suggest generous\r\naction, for you have nothing to contribute.\"\r\n\r\nWith these as beginnings, I arrived at the conclusion that more,\r\npossibly, could be done by way of arousing American interests in Far\r\nEastern affairs by going to the United States than by staying in China.\r\nI feared, also, that if I remained away from America too long, it would\r\nbe difficult readily to get in touch again with affairs there.\r\n\r\nFor such reasons, I came to the decision that I should send my\r\nresignation to the President. I did not wish to run away from a\r\ndifficult and disagreeable situation. Indeed, until the first effects\r\nof the Paris decision had been overcome, I would not leave. Beyond that\r\ntime, I had no desire to remain. Like the Chinese, I at that time still\r\nbelieved that President Wilson had probably met tremendous difficulties\r\nof which I had no knowledge. At any rate, it was far from my purpose to\r\nembarrass him or the Government through my action. Therefore, the only\r\nmotive I gave for my resignation was my desire to return to the United\r\nStates. However, in my letter to the President I tried to express in\r\nmoderate but serious terms my view of the situation and of the action\r\nwhich had been taken at Paris. This letter follows:\r\n\r\n  June 7, 1919.\r\n\r\n  Dear Mr. President:\r\n\r\n I have the honour to place in your hands my resignation as minister to\r\n China and to request that I may be relieved of the duties of this post\r\n as soon as convenient to yourself and to the Secretary of State. My\r\n reason for this action is that I am wearied after nearly six years of\r\n continuous strain, that I feel that the interests of my family demand\r\n my return to the United States, and that I should like to reënter\r\n affairs at home without making my absence so long as to break off all\r\n of the most important relationships.\r\n\r\n I desire to thank you for the confidence you have reposed in me,\r\n and it shall be my greatest desire to continue in the future to\r\n coöperate in helping to realize those great purposes of national and\r\n international policy which you have so clearly and strongly put before\r\n the American nation and the world.\r\n\r\n In making this communication to you I cannot but refer to recent\r\n developments with respect China. The general outlook is indeed most\r\n discouraging, and it seems impossible to accomplish anything here\r\n at present or until the home governments are willing to face the\r\n situation and to act. It is not difficulties that deter me, and I\r\n should stay at my post if it were necessary and if I did not think\r\n that I could be of more use in the United States than in China at the\r\n present time. But in fact, the situation requires that the American\r\n people should be made to realize what is at stake here for us in\r\n order that they may give the necessary backing to the Government for\r\n support in any action which the developments here may Inquire. Unless\r\n the American people realize this and the Government feels strong\r\n enough to take adequate action, the fruits of one hundred and forty\r\n years of American work in China will inevitably be lost. Our people\r\n will be permitted to exist here only on the sufferance of others, and\r\n the great opportunity which has been held out to us by the Chinese\r\n people to assist in the development of education and free institutions\r\n will be gone beyond recall. In its stead there will come a sinister\r\n situation dominated by the unscrupulous methods of the reactionary\r\n military régime centred in Tokyo, absolutist in tendency, cynical of\r\n the principles of free government and human progress. If this force,\r\n with all the methods it is accustomed to apply, remains unopposed\r\n there will be created in the Far East the greatest engine of military\r\n oppression and dominance that the world has yet seen. Nor can we\r\n avoid the conclusion that the brunt of evil results will fall on the\r\n United States, as is already foreshadowed by the bitter hostility and\r\n abnormal vituperativeness of the Japanese press with regard to America.\r\n\r\n The United States and Great Britain will have to stand together in\r\n this matter; I do not think this is realized as fully by Britishers\r\n at home as by those out here. If Russia can become an independent\r\n representative government its interests would parallel ours. The\r\n forces of public opinion and strength which can thus be mobilized are\r\n entirely sufficient to control the situation here and to keep it from\r\n assuming the menacing character which is threatened at present; but\r\n this can only be done if the situation is clearly seen and if it is\r\n realized that the military party of Japan will continue its present\r\n methods and purposes which have proved so successful until it becomes\r\n a dead wall of firm, quiet opposition. There will be a great deal of\r\n talk of friendship for China, of restoration of Shantung, of loyalty\r\n to the League of Nations, but it will be dangerous to accept this and\r\n to stop questioning what are the methods actually applied; as long as\r\n they exist the menace is growing all the time. We cannot rest secure\r\n on treaties nor even on the League of Nations without this checking\r\n up of the facts. Otherwise these instruments would only make the game\r\n a little more complicated but not change its essential character.\r\n The menace can be avoided only if it is made plain to Japan that her\r\n purposes are unmistakable and that the methods utilized to effect\r\n them will by no means be tolerated. Such purposes are the stirring\r\n up of trouble and revolution, encouragement of bandits and pirates,\r\n morphia, financial corruption, misleading of the press, refusal of\r\n just satisfaction when Americans are injured in order to gain prestige\r\n for absolute power, and chief of all official duplicity, such as\r\n the disavowal of knowledge when loans are being made to the Chinese\r\n Government by leading Japanese banks and the subsequent statement by\r\n the Japanese minister that these loans were private arrangements by\r\n \"merchants.\"\r\n\r\n If continuous support could be given not only to the activities of\r\n American merchants but to the constructive forces in Chinese national\r\n life itself these purposes and methods would not have the chance to\r\n flourish and succeed which they now enjoy.\r\n\r\n During the war our action in the support of constructive forces\r\n in China necessarily could not be effective, as our energies were\r\n required elsewhere. Yet I believe that a great opportunity was missed\r\n when China had broken of relations with Germany. The very least\r\n recognition of her sentiments, support and efforts, on our part, would\r\n have changed the entire situation. But while millions upon millions\r\n were paid to the least important of the countries of Europe not a cent\r\n was forthcoming for China. This lack of support drove Tuan and his\r\n followers into the arms of the pro-Japanese agents. Instead of support\r\n we gave China the Lansing-Ishii Note.\r\n\r\n Throughout this period the Japanese game has still been in the stage\r\n of bluff; while Germany seemed at her strongest in the war, indeed the\r\n Japanese were perhaps making their veiled threats with a feeling that\r\n if they should ally themselves with a strong Germany the two would\r\n be invincible; but even at that time a portion of the American navy\r\n detached could have checkmated Japan. Since the complete breakdown of\r\n Germany the case of Japan has been carried through solely on bluff\r\n though perhaps it may be that the Japanese militarists have succeeded\r\n in convincing themselves that their establishment is formidable. But\r\n it is plain that they would be absolutely powerless in the face of a\r\n stoppage of commerce and a navy demonstration on the part of any one\r\n of the great powers. No one desires to think of this contingency, but\r\n it is plain that after the breakdown of Germany it was not feasible\r\n for Japan to use force nor could she have suffered a greater damage\r\n than to exclude herself from the Peace Conference where she had\r\n everything to gain and nothing to lose. In ten years there may be a\r\n very different situation. Then also our people, having grown wise,\r\n will be sure to shout: \"Why was not this stopped while there was yet\r\n time?\" It seems to me necessary that someone in the Government ought\r\n to give attention primarily to China and the Far Eastern situation.\r\n It is very difficult to get any attention for China. I mean any\r\n continuous attention that results in getting something actually\r\n done. Everything else seems to come first because Europe seems so\r\n much nearer; and yet the destinies of Serbia, Czecho-Slovakia, and\r\n Greece are infinitesimal in their importance to the future of America\r\n compared With those of China.\r\n\r\n During my service here I have constantly suffered from this lack of\r\n continuous attention at home to the Far Eastern situation. It has\r\n reacted on the consular service; the interpreter service which is\r\n absolutely necessary to make our consular corps in China effective\r\n has been starved, as no new appointments have been made. In my own\r\n case promises of assistance which had been given repeatedly went\r\n unfulfilled. In this matter I have not the least personal feeling.\r\n I know the result is not due to the personal neglect or ill-will of\r\n any man or group of men, only it seems to me to indicate a general\r\n sentiment of the unimportance of Far Eastern affairs, which ought to\r\n be remedied. I repeat that these statements are not made in a spirit\r\n of complaint; all individual members of the Department of State have\r\n shown nothing but consideration and readiness to assist, but there\r\n has been lacking a concentrated interest in China, which ought to be\r\n represented in some one of the high officials, designated to follow\r\n up Far Eastern affairs and accorded influence commensurate with\r\n responsibilities in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nA NATION STRIKES AND UNITES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe students of Peking \"started something.\" For the first time in\r\nthousands of years public opinion was aroused and organized in China.\r\nThrough the action of the students, with whom the merchants made common\r\ncause, before and after the Shantung decision, China found herself.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese papers insisted steadfastly that these student\r\ndisturbances had been brought on at the \"instigation of certain\r\ncountries.\" But instigation was not needed. If foreigners had wished\r\nto make trouble in this way, they would have been kept extremely\r\nbusy trying to keep pace with the Chinese themselves. You do not\r\nhave to instigate a man to resist a pillager who is trying to break\r\ninto his house. Those who started this tremendous movement toward\r\nnationalism--for that is what it grew into--were students in the\r\ngovernment schools and in the private schools of Peking and Tientsin.\r\nIn the beginning the students were alone in the agitation, but not for\r\nlong. Throughout the agitators were referred to as \"students,\" but this\r\nterm came to be used in a broad sense; it came to mean Young China,\r\nincluding all of the youth of the land who had been educated in modern\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nChina is the home of the strike and the boycott; but never before\r\nhad these weapons been employed on such a scale. The merchants and\r\nstudents of north China met during the second half of May, declared a\r\ngeneral boycott of Japanese goods, and demanded the dismissal of the\r\nthree men called traitors, the notorious agents in the Chino-Japanese\r\nnegotiations. The boycott spread rapidly, a spontaneous expression of\r\ndeep resentment. But the movement strove also to control and purify\r\nthe action of the Chinese Government. The instrument for this was the\r\nstrike--passive resistance--the stopping of the wheels of commerce and\r\nindustry till the will of the people was listened to.\r\n\r\nThe popular sense of equity, which in China asserts itself naturally\r\nin strikes, responded everywhere. Unless the Government dismissed the\r\nthree offenders, merchants would close their shops. Teachers, students,\r\nshopkeepers, chauffeurs, dockhands, all classes of workmen would\r\nstrike. All China, indeed, would go on strike.\r\n\r\nThe movement gained momentum like an avalanche thundering down a\r\nmountain. Its fury was first of all concentrated on the attempt to\r\nforce the dismissal of the three officials who were, in the popular\r\nmind, guilty of trading away the national birthright. The organization\r\nof the uprising seemed to be almost spontaneous. Active little groups,\r\nsimilar to the Committees of Correspondence in the time of Adams and\r\nFranklin, sprang up in all parts of China. The masses of the people\r\nwere marshalled for action. From the ten thousand students who had\r\noriginally struck in Shanghai the movement expanded swiftly until it\r\nincluded merchants and chambers of commerce and dozens of other bodies\r\nin every walk of life. Associations of servants were formed under the\r\ntitle of The Industrial National Salvation Society. Even Japanese\r\nbankers were put under the ban by the Chinese financiers; finally the\r\nboycott went so far that it blacklisted the foreign goods which were\r\nbrought to Chinese ports by Japanese steamers.\r\n\r\nIn Peking, fifty groups of student speakers were sent out to appeal\r\nto the public. General Tuan Chi-jui, who, among others, was held\r\nresponsible by the students for the nation's troubles, stoutly stood by\r\nhis subordinates. The militarists in general, feeling that the student\r\nmovement was not favourable to them, prevailed on the Government to try\r\nto suppress it. Martial law was proclaimed, and students trying to\r\nspeak were arrested. The students were undaunted and working en masse.\r\nThe Government soon saw that it could imprison them, but that it was\r\npowerless to stem the tide of feeling they were creating. Thundering\r\nfrom all parts of the country, it was recognized that the students\r\ncould, if they chose, turn the entire people against the Government.\r\nBy June 4th, nearly a thousand students were under forcible detention\r\nin Peking; those recently arrested had wisely provided themselves with\r\nknapsacks stocked with food before taking their lecture trips.\r\n\r\nThen the girl students came forth. They fully shared the patriotic\r\nfeelings of their brothers. Seven hundred girls from the Peking schools\r\nassembled and marched to the President's palace to request the release\r\nof the young men under arrest.\r\n\r\nThe Government made a technical mistake. When the student feeling\r\nseemed to be a little on the ebb, the Government took occasion to issue\r\na decree trying to white-wash Tsao Ju-lin and his confederates. That\r\nfanned the flame which ultimately swept all over China.\r\n\r\nWeakening, the Government offered the students release if they would\r\nreturn to work and make no further trouble. The students saw their\r\nadvantage, and stated that they had no wish to leave their prisons, if\r\nit meant promising to abstain from expressing their opinion in future;\r\nmoreover, they would not leave until the Government had apologized for\r\ntheir unjust arrest.\r\n\r\nThe jailing of this large number of the youth of China finally\r\nbrought such ill-concealed opposition that the Government complied\r\nwith the students' ultimatum. An apology was offered them, whereupon\r\nthe students returned to their colleges and their work. But they\r\ncontinued their street lectures, calling upon the people to join in a\r\npowerful expression of national opinion through which their country's\r\ninstitutions and policies might be put on a sounder basis, and Japanese\r\naggression powerfully resisted.\r\n\r\nIn Shanghai the boycott and the strike of the shopkeepers were in full\r\nforce. Their shops were closed, they threatened to pay no taxes unless\r\nthe \"traitors\" were ousted. American officials at Shanghai sent me\r\nalarming reports. The British there, particularly those of the official\r\nclass, were inclined to repress the movement.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese, who were feeling the full force of the popular thrust,\r\ntried to brand it anti-foreign and to reawaken memories of the Boxer\r\nperiod. Some of the influential British in Shanghai, frightened by the\r\nsuccessful efforts of the merchants and students among the industrial\r\nworkers, began to call them anti-foreign, too. I was told that the\r\nmunicipal council in Shanghai might take very stringent action against\r\nthe boycott and strike. The British minister had gone to the seashore,\r\nand I sent him word that the situation was serious.\r\n\r\nIt would have been the height of folly had either we or the British\r\nlet ourselves be dragged into the disturbance, which was directed\r\nsolely against the Japanese, and was fortunately not our concern,\r\nand in no sense anti-foreign. I sent specific instructions to the\r\nconsulate-general at Shanghai advising the American community neither\r\nto encourage nor oppose this movement, which was the affair of the\r\nChinese. The Americans saw the point clearly, and realized how\r\nundesirable it would be to entangle the municipal council in the\r\nbusiness. I told the Consul-General that, illegal and overt acts\r\nexcepted, the foreign authorities in China had nothing to do with the\r\nstrike; being happily free of Chinese ill-will, we wished to remain\r\nfree. In order to avoid all danger of more general trouble, Americans\r\nexerted considerable influence with the Chinese leaders to cause them\r\nto abstain from action that would tend to involve foreigners generally.\r\nThey responded willingly.\r\n\r\nBy this time even the mafoos (horse boys) at the Shanghai Race Club\r\nwere on strike. A run on the Bank of Communications was started because\r\nTsao Ju-lin was associated with it. More and more serious grew the\r\nsituation, but the demand on the Government remained unchanged: \"When\r\nthe three traitors are dismissed, the strike will be called off;\r\notherwise, still more people will strike.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government finally yielded on the 11th of June. The insistent\r\ndemand had come from all parts of China that the three unpopular\r\nofficials go in disgrace. The Peking Government complied. But the great\r\npublic in Shanghai was not content until the British minister and I\r\ngave confirmation of the report that the mandate of dismissal had been\r\nissued. Then the strike was off.\r\n\r\nHowever, the boycott against Japanese goods continued unabated. Yet\r\nit must not be supposed that the movement, which at the beginning was\r\ndistinctly turned against Japan, was either essentially anti-Japanese\r\nor purely oppositional and negative. Quite early, its true, positive,\r\nnational Chinese character stood revealed. The Japanese had stung the\r\nChinese national pride to the quick. It turned against them, not in a\r\nspirit of blind hostility, but only in so far as the Japanese stood in\r\nthe way of the national Chinese regeneration.\r\n\r\nOut of this unprecedented popular uprising several momentous facts\r\nemerged. First, public opinion must be so awakened that it would be\r\na continuing force, so organized that it would at all times have the\r\nmeans of expressing its will, so that it would be able to compel the\r\nGovernment to resist further encroachments on China's rights. That\r\nwould take time; but it could be done, the strike and boycott proved\r\nthat. For the first time in her history China had roused herself and\r\nwrung from her government a specific surrender. That lesson sank deep.\r\nThe leaders realized that this single act was merely a very small\r\nbeginning. But the important thing was that it did constitute a\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nThe second important result was the sudden focussing of attention on\r\nthe means by which native Chinese industry might be built up. The\r\nboycott of Japanese goods had had a positive as well as a negative\r\nside. Indeed it had been stated positively all along. The people were\r\nnot told to refrain from buying Japanese goods; they were advised to\r\navoid buying goods of an inferior quality--which would be interpreted\r\nto mean Japanese products, of course--and they were pointedly urged to\r\npatronize home industries. The people responded with a will. They did\r\nbuy the wares produced by their own factories. It gave great impetus to\r\nthe development of Chinese industry, and gave both the manufacturers\r\nand the Government a clue as to what a definite campaign for the\r\nstimulation of the home industries might accomplish.\r\n\r\nWhile we were talking together informally at a meeting of the\r\ndiplomatic corps, the French minister, M. Boppe, remarked: \"We are in\r\nthe presence of the most astounding and important thing that has ever\r\nhappened--the organization of a national public opinion in China for\r\npositive action.\"\r\n\r\nThus out of the evil of the Paris decision came an inspiring national\r\nawakening of the Chinese people, a welding together for joint thought\r\nand joint action. All ranks of the population were affected. When\r\nto avoid foreign complications student delegates went among the\r\nworkers of a factory in Shanghai to persuade them not to strike, the\r\nworkers asked: \"Do you think we have no feeling for our country, nor\r\nindignation against the traitors?\"\r\n\r\nAbout the evil of the Shantung decision the foreign communities were\r\nunanimous, nor did they feel that they ought to be silent. They were on\r\nthe ground; they knew the inevitable consequences that would follow the\r\nrigid application of the decision. They spoke out. Sir Edward Walker,\r\nchairman of the Commercial Bank of Canada, gave an address on June 6th\r\nbefore the Anglo-American Association of Peking, dealing particularly\r\nwith the needs of transportation. What the completion of two or three\r\ntrunk lines would mean to China he fully realized. After his address\r\nthe British minister and I, who were honorary members, took our leave,\r\nas it had been intimated that the Association would discuss the\r\nShantung matter. The meeting then adopted a resolution which expressed\r\nthe conviction of Americans and British in China in this wise:\r\n\r\n We express our solemn conviction that this decision will create\r\n conditions that must inevitably bring about extreme discord between\r\n the Chinese people and Japan, and raise a most serious hindrance\r\n to the development of the economic interests of China and other\r\n countries. A settlement which perpetuates the conditions created by\r\n Germany's aggression in Shantung in 1898, conditions that led to\r\n similar action on the part of other states, that were contributing\r\n causes to the disorders in North China in 1900, and that made\r\n inevitable the Russo-Japanese war, cannot make for peace in the Far\r\n East, for political stability in China itself, or for development of\r\n trade and commerce equally open to all.\r\n\r\n Further, the evil consequences of conditions which are not only\r\n subversive of the principle of national self-determination, but also\r\n a denial of the policy of the open door and of the principle of\r\n equality of opportunity, will be greatly accentuated if Japan, a near\r\n neighbour, be now substituted for Germany, whose centre of political\r\n and economic activities was on the other side of the globe.\r\n\r\n Therefore we, the members of the Peking Anglo-American Association,\r\n resolve that representations be made to the British and American\r\n Governments urging that the states taking part in the Peace Conference\r\n devise and carry through a just settlement which will not endanger the\r\n safety of China and the peace of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTAKING LEAVE OF PEKING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government was now confronted with the question of whether its\r\ndelegates at Paris should or should not sign the Treaty and Covenant.\r\nThe Chinese people were opposed to signing, for with China's signature\r\nwould go specific recognition of the transfer of German rights to\r\nJapan. They had learned one great lesson: that to make concessions to\r\nforeign powers never got them out of trouble, but only aggravated it.\r\nIf the Peking officials in 1898 had turned a deaf ear to the German\r\ndemands, despite threats of naval demonstrations, the Germans could\r\nnever have secured the things which the Chinese actually gave them. The\r\nChinese people now said: \"Never again!\"\r\n\r\nI was informed on the 28th of May that nearly all the officials in\r\nPeking were agreed that the Treaty should be signed. Knowledge of\r\ntheir readiness to capitulate brought the national movement of the\r\nChinese people to its height almost immediately, in opposition to the\r\nreactionary militarist control. By the 1st of July, a gentleman from\r\nthe immediate entourage of the President, who often came to see me on\r\nthe latter's behalf, told me that the President had instructed the\r\ndelegates at Paris not to sign the Treaty. They did not sign it then,\r\nand steadfastly resisted all efforts to make them sign it later.\r\n\r\nWhen the student troubles were at their height, on the 2nd of June\r\nI was at the Legation late one evening to answer some cablegrams. I\r\nwas interrupted by an American woman teacher who with five Chinese\r\nschoolgirls came to my office in a state of great excitement. The girls\r\nhad stood with a crowd for forty-eight hours asking admission to the\r\nPresident's palace to present their grievance. They had endured these\r\nhardships as bravely as any of the young men, but they were now alarmed\r\nbecause two of the student leaders had been seized and taken inside the\r\npalace. The girls feared their execution, and begged me to intercede.\r\nAs I could not quiet their apprehensions, I finally said I would direct\r\nthat an inquiry be made at the palace. By telephone I learned that the\r\nstudents were being detained because they had been too forward in their\r\ndemonstrations, but that nothing untoward would happen to them. The\r\ngirls, happy and thankful at this reassurance, went home.\r\n\r\nNo one could fail to sympathize with the aims and ideals of the\r\nstudents, who were striving for national freedom and regeneration. I,\r\ntoo, felt a strong sympathy, though I, of course, abstained from all\r\ndirect contact with the movement, as it was a purely Chinese matter.\r\nNevertheless, the Japanese papers reported quite in detail how I\r\nhad organized the student movement, and how I had spent $2,000,000\r\nin getting it under way. As everybody knew how spontaneous and\r\nirrepressible the movement of the students was, these items excited\r\nonly amusement.\r\n\r\nPessimism reigned among liberal-minded people in early June. They\r\nfeared that followers of General Tuan would insist upon putting him\r\nback into the Premiership, in which case there would be no escape from\r\nanother revolution to oppose him, with the general demoralization\r\nand waste of national resources which would attend it. The second\r\n_aide mémoire_ of the associated representatives was presented to the\r\nPresident by Sir John Jordan on the 5th of June; it conveyed the hope\r\nthat China's internal difficulties might now come to an end, that\r\nthe peace conference at Shanghai might be resumed and successfully\r\nconcluded without delay, and it stated that meanwhile military\r\nmeasures should not be resumed. The friendly advice encouraged the\r\nliberal elements, particularly the express desire that there should\r\nbe no further fighting. It was felt that the President's hands were\r\nstrengthened for peace.\r\n\r\nDr. Chiang Monlin, Acting Chancellor of Peking University in the\r\nabsence of Dr. Tsai Yuan-pei, went to Shanghai because the militarist\r\nfaction wished to hold him responsible for the acts of the students.\r\nHe was, indeed, one of their chief counsellors, but he counselled\r\nwisdom and moderation. He told me that the leaders were conscious of\r\nmuch progress in organizing public opinion, but that at least ten\r\nyears of further work and experience would be necessary before there\r\ncould be any approach to a public opinion consciously and unceasingly\r\nactive in support, or in proper restraint, of the Government. \"All we\r\nask,\" Doctor Chiang said, \"is ten years' time--freedom from outside\r\ninterference--then the New China will be organized.\"\r\n\r\nI visited General Tuan, finding him calm but stubborn as usual. I\r\nasked him whether, if the students should call on him, he would go out\r\nto speak to them. \"I would certainly do that,\" he replied; \"I am in\r\nsympathy with them, but I feel that they are often misled by people\r\nwhose motives are not disinterested.\" I told him that I believed the\r\nstudents would gladly follow him and make him their leader if they\r\ncould be assured that he would not be controlled by counsellors who had\r\nnot the true welfare of China at heart.\r\n\r\nThis movement of the Chinese people impressed me the more vividly in\r\nthe light of a letter from R.F. Johnston on July 3rd which led me to\r\nhark back to the days of the old Empire. Mr. Johnston was a tutor of\r\nthe young Emperor, and he inclosed a translation of a Chinese poem\r\nwhich the Emperor had written out for me. It bore the Imperial seals,\r\nand was dated: \"Eleventh year of Hsuan Tung, sixth month, fifth day.\"\r\nHere is the first verse:\r\n\r\n  The red bows unbent,\r\n  Were received and deposited.\r\n  I have here an admirable guest,\r\n  And with all my heart I bestow one on him.\r\n  The bells and drums have been arranged in order,\r\n  And all the morning will I feast him.\r\n\r\nShortly after, in a talk I had with Mr. Johnston, he told me that the\r\nlittle Emperor had himself conceived the idea of writing something for\r\nme. Johnston had suggested a certain poem but it did not satisfy his\r\npupil, who finally made his own selection. He said to his tutor: \"I\r\nwant to imagine that the American minister is coming to the palace as\r\nmy guest.\"\r\n\r\nThe young Emperor, Mr. Johnston said, was interested in everything\r\nthat went on in the political and social life of the capital, and read\r\nthe papers every day. I attributed his interest in my doings to the\r\nfact that the Emperor shared the love for America that is general in\r\nChina; but, also, I think the repeated likelihood of being taken to\r\nthe American Legation for refuge and shelter had impressed itself very\r\nstrongly on his youthful mind, so that it seemed to him a haven of\r\nescape from all terror and danger.\r\n\r\nReports came at the end of July that President Wilson was defending\r\nthe Shantung settlement, by stating that it conferred on Japan no\r\npolitical rights but only economic privileges. Had Mr. Wilson given\r\nattention to the details of the question, as reported over and over\r\nagain in telegrams and dispatches from the Legation and consulates in\r\nChina, he could not have harboured such a misunderstanding. In this\r\ninstance the President based his action rather on vague assurances\r\ngiven by Japan, the actual bearing of which he did not know. The term\r\n\"economic privileges\" can hardly apply to such matters as control\r\nof the port of Tsingtao and the Shantung Railway, and to a general\r\ncommercial preference in Shantung Province; yet these were plainly what\r\nJapan wished to retain. Her pledge \"to return Shantung Peninsula with\r\nfull sovereignty\" sounded satisfactory, but it was never defined to\r\ncover more than the 150 square miles of agricultural and mountain land\r\nwhich the Germans had held as a leasehold, exclusive of Tsingtao port.\r\nThat important harbour the Japanese intended to retain, as well as the\r\nterminals, railway, and mines.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the Chinese to sign the Paris Treaty afforded an\r\nopportunity for saving Shantung to China. But if the German rights\r\nwere to be confirmed to Japan under the term of \"economic privileges,\"\r\nwe should soon find that these economic privileges meant an end of\r\nindependent American enterprise in Shantung Province. Japan had used\r\nsuch \"economic privileges\" in Manchuria. We were amply warned what to\r\nexpect from an extension of that policy to other parts of China.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson stated later that the League would prevent Japan from\r\nassuming full sovereignty over Shantung. Here he again misunderstood.\r\nJapan had no idea of asking for sovereignty over Shantung; she had\r\nabsolutely no right to it, and did not need it for carrying out her\r\nplans, so long as she could retain the politico-economic rights awarded\r\nat Paris.\r\n\r\nI reiterated these statements in my telegrams to Washington. I\r\nexplained again that ownership by a foreign government of port\r\nfacilities and of a railway leading into the interior of China,\r\ntogether with exclusive commercial preferences, are economic rights\r\nso fortified politically that they constitute political control--as\r\nManchuria shows--without the name. In fact, they could be safely\r\naccompanied with most profuse protestations to respect Chinese\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\nThe question of political sovereignty was beside the mark. It had\r\nbeen broached, as I have pointed out, to make the world believe that\r\nsomething was being returned. \"Returning Shantung Peninsula with full\r\nsovereignty\" was a big phrase and it had an imposing sound. But the\r\nsovereignty of Shantung was not involved, it had never been either\r\nGerman or Japanese: it had always been Chinese. The 150 square miles of\r\nunimportant land outside the port of Tsingtao might be \"returned with\r\nfull sovereignty,\" but nobody cared for that. To talk of sovereignty\r\nmerely obscured the issue.\r\n\r\nDr. Sun Yat-sen was just then busying himself with the task of\r\ndrawing up projects for the further economic development of China\r\nwith international participation, and I corresponded with him. In\r\none of my letters I considered how rapid and sweeping the industrial\r\ntransformation of China should be. I wrote:\r\n\r\n I believe that we should at all times keep in mind the fact that we\r\n are not dealing with a new country, but with one in which social\r\n arrangements are exceedingly intricate and in which a long-tested\r\n system of agricultural and industrial organization exists. It is to\r\n my mind most important that the transition to new methods of industry\r\n and labour should not be sudden but that the old values should be\r\n gradually transmuted. It is highly important that artistic ability,\r\n such as exists, for instance, in silk and porcelain manufacture,\r\n should be maintained and protected, and not superseded by cheaper\r\n processes. The one factor in modern organization which the Chinese\r\n must learn to understand better is the corporation, and the fiduciary\r\n relationship which the officers of the corporation ought to occupy\r\n with respect to the stockholders. If the Chinese cannot learn to use\r\n the corporation properly, the organization of the national credit\r\n cannot be effected. Here, too, it is necessary that the principle of\r\n personal honesty which was fostered under the old system should not\r\n be lost, but transferred to the new methods of doing business. So,\r\n at every point where we are planning for a better and more efficient\r\n organization, it seems necessary to hold on to the values created in\r\n the past, and not to disturb the balance of Chinese society by too\r\n sudden changes.\r\n\r\nAmong his suggestions for constructive works, Dr. Sun Yat-sen had\r\nspoken of a northern port, somewhere on the coast of Chihli Province,\r\nwhich should have water deep enough to admit large ocean-going\r\nships. The port of Tientsin is not adequate: it is far up river,\r\nand lacks satisfactory anchorage where the river empties into the\r\nsea. Chinwangtao is a far better port, but so exposed that enormous\r\nexpenditure would be needed to improve it; and its capacity, even then,\r\nwould be too small. I asked Mr. Paul P. Whitham, special commissioner\r\nof the Department of Commerce, to go to the Chihli coast to see\r\nwhether about half way between Tientsin and Chinwangtao a satisfactory\r\nport site might be found. He succeeded in finding a site where, with\r\ncomparatively moderate expense, a deep-sea port could be built. It\r\nwas easy to see the transformation in north China commerce that this\r\nwould bring about. Here would be an outlet for a rich and extensive\r\nhinterland, including the Province of Chihli and all the region to the\r\nnorth and northwest of it, particularly inner Mongolia and western\r\nManchuria. I talked the matter over with the civil governor and other\r\nprovincial leaders of Chihli Province, also with the representatives\r\nof Governor Li Hsun of Nanking, besides certain members of the Central\r\nGovernment. They greatly favoured the project, and before many weeks\r\npreliminary surveys were made. It was to be known as the Great Northern\r\nPort.\r\n\r\nI visited Sir John Jordan on August 14th telling him of my resignation,\r\nat which he expressed regret; but he admitted that he could understand\r\nwhy I wished to return to the United States. He, too, wished to be\r\nrelieved of his duties as soon as possible. I had on that day a very\r\nfull talk about Shantung with Mr. Yoshizawa, Japanese Chargé, in which\r\nwe considered ways which might render the Shantung arrangement more\r\nsatisfactory, especially if Tsingtao should be made into a genuine\r\ninternational settlement. But I emphasized the importance of the return\r\nof the railway.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations for the new Consortium had been going on for some\r\ntime. The Japanese proposed that the Consortium should not apply to\r\nManchuria and eastern Mongolia. The Japanese-controlled press had\r\nattacked the first proposal of this Consortium, as Japan purposed\r\nduring the war to achieve complete leadership of foreign finance in\r\nChina. If the United States would join the _old_ Consortium, Japan\r\nwould have been pleased, for there she led. But ordinarily the\r\nfinancial power of Japan is of distinctly secondary importance, and the\r\nabnormal conditions of the war could not last. Now Japan approved of\r\nthe new Consortium in principle, but continued to procrastinate when a\r\ndecision on details was required.\r\n\r\nMy resignation was accepted in a cablegram received on the 18th of\r\nAugust, the President expressing formally his regret that I should find\r\nit necessary to insist upon relinquishing my post. Even now, when I\r\nknew how decidedly the President had misjudged the Chinese situation,\r\nnotwithstanding my insistent and detailed warnings, I had no desire\r\nto advertise differences in policy. The Japanese press, I knew, would\r\nconsider my resignation due to the defeat of my \"policy\" to have\r\nAmerica maintain her honourable and trusted position in China. I did\r\nnot wish to favour this sort of interpretation by a controversy with\r\nthe administration.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese understood the situation quite completely. When I told\r\nthe President, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Premier, and\r\nnon-official Chinese friends, they seemed discouraged at the prospect\r\nof my leaving China at this juncture. I had the good fortune to make\r\nmany friendships in China with men whose loyalty and truthfulness could\r\nbe relied upon. Though seemingly distressed at the idea of my going,\r\nthey knew I only hoped it might enable the work of developing close\r\nrelations between the two countries to continue more effectively. I\r\nwished to bring about positive practical action. The spirit of the\r\nAmerican policies and declarations was admirable, but not enough\r\nindividual and specific American activity in China accompanied them.\r\n\r\nMr. Fu, Acting Minister of Education, and a number of his associates\r\nvisited me on the 25th of August, to consider arrangements for exchange\r\nprofessorships in American and Chinese universities. I had always\r\nfavoured bringing young Chinese scholars into lectureships in American\r\nuniversities, to make accessible to the American public the treasures\r\nof Chinese literature, philosophy, and art. President Yuan Shih-kai had\r\nsupported this idea, and, but for the unfortunate monarchical movement,\r\nwould have done much to promote intellectual contact between the United\r\nStates and China. His successors shared his sentiments, and only the\r\nturmoil in Peking's political life prevented their working out plans in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hsu Shu-cheng called on me from time to time and told me about\r\nhis Mongolian venture. When the War Participation Bureau became plainly\r\nobsolete its name was changed to \"Northwest Frontier Defence Bureau.\"\r\nEverybody knew against whom this Bureau was to \"defend\" China, though\r\nthere was talk about Bolshevik activity in Mongolia, also of the\r\ndesigns of General Semenoff to create a Pan-Mongolian state. General\r\nHsu unfolded in his talks with me very large schemes for developing\r\nMongolia, including a colonial bank, the building of highways for\r\nmotor transport, the digging of artesian wells, and the establishment\r\nof model farms. He would, he said, also promote the completion of\r\nthe railway from Kalgan to Urga, and would even extend it to Chinese\r\nTurkestan. Report had it that the Japanese had promised General Hsu\r\nan advance of $50,000,000 for his enterprises. But he told me that he\r\nwould carry them out with capital entirely subscribed in China. The\r\nPresident and other Peking leaders, it was said, apprehensive of the\r\ndirection the overflowing energies of General Hsu might take next,\r\nbethought themselves of the undeveloped reaches of Mongolia. There\r\nwould be the field ample enough for his ebullient nature. All this\r\ntime the Japanese were carefully watching any factor that might become\r\nactive in Mongolia, including General Semenoff, General Chang Tso-lin,\r\nthe Viceroy of Manchuria, and General Hsu Shu-cheng. Whatever might\r\nhappen there, they undoubtedly intended that it should fit in with\r\ntheir policy of imposing their influence upon that dependency.\r\n\r\nMrs. Reinsch and my family had sailed from Chinwangtao on the 12th\r\nof June for Honolulu, where they were to spend the summer. As my\r\nresignation had already gone forward, it was a farewell to Peking for\r\nMrs. Reinsch, who was reluctant to leave the city which she had enjoyed\r\nso much. A series of farewell luncheons, dinners, and receptions began\r\nfor me in August which, with the heavy work of winding up the business\r\nof my office, filled the remaining weeks with activity every day from\r\nsunrise until after midnight. When President Hsu Shih-chang entertained\r\nme for the last time, he said: \"The Chinese look to you to be a friend\r\nand guide to them, and we hope your action and influence may continue\r\nfor many decades.\" On the next day he invited me, through Mr. Chow\r\nTsu-chi, to act as counsellor to the Chinese Government, with residence\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nI left Peking on the evening of September 13th. All my colleagues with\r\nmembers of their staffs, the high Chinese officials, and a throng of\r\nother people, had gathered at the station to say \"good-bye.\" Drawn up\r\non the platform were companies of the American marines, the Indian\r\ntroops of the British Legation Guard, and Chinese troops. With the\r\nActing Premier, Mr. Kung Shin-Chan, I inspected them, accepted their\r\nsalute, and made a few farewell remarks to the faithful marines. As\r\nthe American band played \"Auld Lang Syne,\" the train moved out of the\r\nstation, and the thousands of faces of those who had come to see me\r\noff became blurred in the distance, leaving impressed on my mind a\r\ncomposite face, friendly, eager, urging to endeavour.\r\n\r\nMy friend, Chow Tsu-chi, accompanied me as far as Tientsin where\r\nI parted with him. It had, all in all, been a truly heart-warming\r\nleave-taking. I felt that the spontaneous expressions of deep\r\nconfidence both on the part of my countrymen and of the Chinese would\r\nremain with me as the best reward for any exertions and efforts I had\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nDr. Charles D. Tenney, American Chargé d'Affaires after my departure,\r\nwrote the following report to the Secretary of State concerning the\r\nfarewell hospitalities:\r\n\r\n I have the honour to state that the departure from Peking of the\r\n Honourable Paul S. Reinsch, American Minister to China, whose\r\n resignation has been accepted by the President, was made the occasion\r\n of gratifying manifestations of cordiality toward the United States\r\n and of the highest popular and official esteem for the retiring\r\n Minister.\r\n\r\n Mr. Reinsch was naturally the guest of honour at numerous dinners\r\n and receptions in the period just preceding his departure, at which\r\n the Chinese present expressed the deepest appreciation of his\r\n diversified activities during the six years of his tenure of office.\r\n Published references to Mr. Reinsch's career as American Minister,\r\n also, refer to his many-sided interest in and efforts to promote the\r\n joint commercial, industrial, and educational interests of China\r\n and the United States, in addition to the usual duty of fostering\r\n international unity between the two nations. It was made strikingly\r\n evident that the Government and people of this Republic have come\r\n earnestly to desire and expect a policy of vigorous advancement of\r\n these interests by the United States in China. The feeling of all was\r\n epitomized by President Hsu Shih-chang, who, at Mr. Reinsch's farewell\r\n interview, asserted his profound belief that the latter's activities\r\n as Minister had advanced and strengthened in a very real way all\r\n those economic and social relations that to-day bind the governments\r\n and peoples of China and the United States in close friendship, at\r\n the same time expressing his hope that on his return to the United\r\n States Mr. Reinsch would abate none of his efforts toward these ends,\r\n but that in his altered capacity he would continue to work in the\r\n interests of China.\r\n\r\n Mr. Reinsch left Peking on the evening of the thirteenth instant and\r\n the scene at the railway station was of an unusual and gratifying\r\n description. Although it is not customary for guards of honour to\r\n be tendered by other legations on the departure of ministers,\r\n on this occasion there was present a detachment from the British\r\n Legation Guard, and there were also present detachments from the\r\n American Legation Guard, the Peking police force and the Peking\r\n gendarmerie, with military music. The Acting Premier came in person\r\n to the station to bid farewell to Mr. Reinsch and there were present\r\n a thousand persons, including Chinese officials, foreign diplomats,\r\n representatives of all varieties of institutions and societies, and\r\n personal friends of all nationalities.\r\n\r\nI had turned over arrangements for my trip through Japan to Mr. Willing\r\nSpencer, the First Secretary, who had consulted with Mr. Tokugawa,\r\nof the Japanese Legation. Their main difficulty had been the fact\r\nthat Korea was under quarantine because of the cholera. An amusing\r\nexperience ensued. In order to avoid any risk of delay I agreed to be\r\ninoculated; this was done deferentially by a little physician who came\r\nfrom the Japanese Legation. At Shimonoseki our steamer arrived in the\r\nearly morning, and was held in quarantine. The inspecting officers who\r\nboarded said I should be permitted to land almost immediately. However,\r\nthey left and said a launch would be sent for me before noon. As the\r\nevening train would be the last that could make my connection with the\r\nsteamer at Yokohama, I waited somewhat nervously for the launch. It\r\nwas three o'clock before the officers returned, saying that my baggage\r\ncould now be taken ashore; soon they disappeared with the baggage, but\r\nleft me still on the boat. I wired the embassy at Tokyo, telling them\r\nof my predicament. The train was to leave at half-past seven, and no\r\nlaunch had appeared at six.\r\n\r\nSuddenly out of the evening mist covering the bay a little launch\r\nemerged, and an official I had not seen before boarded and asked me\r\nto accompany him. Descending to the launch with my two servants, I\r\nwas surprised to notice that it did not head toward Shimonoseki, but\r\ntook the opposite direction. I remonstrated, but the officer, smiling\r\nreassuringly, said: \"It will be all right.\" Then the two inspecting\r\nofficers appeared from below; smiling and bowing they told me we were\r\ngoing to the Isolation Hospital!\r\n\r\nAnd to the Isolation Hospital we went. There in the central reception\r\nroom I was introduced to the chief, who, after a brief exchange of\r\ncivilities, announced, \"Now, everything is all right.\"\r\n\r\nWe took the launch, and arrived at Shimonoseki with still a quarter\r\nof an hour to spare before the train departed, whereon a special\r\ncompartment had been reserved for me. Everything was now clear. The\r\nJapanese passengers on the steamer were as little pleased at being\r\ndetained there as I was. Had a foreigner, even a foreign minister, been\r\ntaken off the ship to Shimonoseki, a small riot might be looked for.\r\nSo the word was passed around that I was being taken to the Isolation\r\nHospital, where nobody had any particular wish to go. I could not but\r\nadmire the resourcefulness of these little officials, and to feel\r\nthankful to them for all the trouble they took to solve this knotty\r\nproblem without doing violence to any of their quarantine regulations.\r\n\r\nI had only one day in Tokyo. A luncheon had been arranged for me\r\nat the house of Baron Okura, where I went with Ambassador Morris\r\nand met several Japanese gentlemen, among them Mr. Hanihara, just\r\nmade Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Baron Shidehara, the new\r\nAmbassador to the United States. We took lunch on an open veranda,\r\noverlooking delightful gardens, and after an animated conversation\r\nI took my leave and hurried to Yokohama, with the same agreeable\r\nimpression of Japanese hospitality that I had received six years\r\nbefore, on my first arrival in the Far East.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n    Abbott, John J., 256, 260\r\n\r\n    Adams, Dr.
