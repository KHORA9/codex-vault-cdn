HASTINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. Burke on the 10th of May, 1787, \"That Warren Hastings,\r\nEsq., be impeached,\" having been carried without a division, Mr. Sheridan\r\nwas appointed one of the Managers, \"to make good the Articles\" of the\r\nImpeachment, and, on the 3d of June in the following year, brought\r\nforward the same Charge in Westminster Hall which he had already enforced\r\nwith such wonderful talent in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nTo be called upon for a second great effort of eloquence, on a subject of\r\nwhich all the facts and the bearings remained the same, was, it must be\r\nacknowledged, no ordinary trial to even the most fertile genius; and Mr.\r\nFox, it is said, hopeless of any second flight ever rising to the grand\r\nelevation of the first, advised that the former Speech should be, with\r\nvery little change, repeated. But such a plan, however welcome it might\r\nbe to the indolence of his friend, would have looked too like an\r\nacknowledgment of exhaustion on the subject to be submitted to by one so\r\njustly confident in the resources both of his reason and fancy.\r\nAccordingly, he had the glory of again opening, in the very same field, a\r\nnew and abundant spring of eloquence, which, during four days, diffused\r\nits enchantment among an assembly of the most illustrious persons of the\r\nland, and of which Mr. Burke pronounced at its conclusion, that \"of all\r\nthe various species of oratory, of every kind of eloquence that had been\r\nheard, either in ancient or modern times; whatever the acuteness of the\r\nbar, the dignity of the senate, or the morality of the pulpit could\r\nfurnish, had not been equal to what that House had that day heard in\r\nWestminster Hall. No holy religionist, no man of any description as a\r\nliterary character, could have come up, in the one instance, to the pure\r\nsentiments of morality, or in the other, to the variety of knowledge,\r\nforce of imagination, propriety and vivacity of allusion, beauty and\r\nelegance of diction, and strength of expression, to which they had that\r\nday listened. From poetry up to eloquence there was not a species of\r\ncomposition of which a complete and perfect specimen might not have been\r\nculled, from one part or the other of the speech to which he alluded, and\r\nwhich, he was persuaded, had left too strong an impression on the minds\r\nof that House to be easily obliterated.\"\r\n\r\nAs some atonement to the world for the loss of the Speech in the House of\r\nCommons, this second master-piece of eloquence on the same subject has\r\nbeen preserved to us in a Report, from the short-hand notes of Mr.\r\nGurney, which was for some time in the possession of the late Duke of\r\nNorfolk, but was afterwards restored to Mr. Sheridan, and is now in my\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable the reader fully to understand the extracts from this\r\nReport which I am about to give, it will be necessary to detail briefly\r\nthe history of the transaction, on which the charge brought forward in\r\nthe Speech was founded.\r\n\r\nAmong the native Princes who, on the transfer of the sceptre of Tamerlane\r\nto the East India Company, became tributaries or rather slaves to that\r\nHonorable body, none seems to have been treated with more capricious\r\ncruelty than Cheyte Sing, the Rajah of Benares. In defiance of a solemn\r\ntreaty, entered into between him and the government of Mr. Hastings, by\r\nwhich it was stipulated that, besides his fixed tribute, no further\r\ndemands, of any kind, should be made upon him, new exactions were every\r\nyear enforced;--while the humble remonstrances of the Rajah against such\r\ngross injustice were not only treated with slight, but punished by\r\narbitrary and enormous fines. Even the proffer of bribe succeeded only in\r\nbeing accepted [Footnote: This was the transaction that formed one of the\r\nprincipal grounds of the Seventh Charge brought forward in the House of\r\nCommons by Mr. Sheridan. The suspicious circumstances attending this\r\npresent are thus summed up by Mr. Mill: \"At first, perfect concealment of\r\nthe transaction--such measures, however, taken as may, if afterwards\r\nnecessary, appear to imply a design of future disclosure;--when\r\nconcealment becomes difficult and hazardous, then disclosure\r\nmade.\"--_History of British India_.]--the exactions which it was\r\nintended to avert being continued as rigorously as before. At length, in\r\nthe year 1781, Mr. Hastings, who invariably, among the objects of his\r\ngovernment, placed the interests of Leadenhall Street first on the list,\r\nand those of justice and humanity _longo intervallo_ after,--finding\r\nthe treasury of the Company in a very exhausted state, resolved to\r\nsacrifice this unlucky Rajah to their replenishment; and having as a\r\npreliminary step, imposed upon him a mulct of £500,000, set out\r\nimmediately for his capital, Benares, to compel the payment of it. Here,\r\nafter rejecting with insult the suppliant advances of the Prince, he put\r\nhim under arrest, and imprisoned him in his own palace. This violation of\r\nthe rights and the roof of their sovereign drove the people of the whole\r\nprovince into a sudden burst of rebellion, of which Mr. Hastings himself\r\nwas near being the victim. The usual triumph, however, of might over\r\nright ensued; the Rajah's castle was plundered of all its treasures, and\r\nhis mother, who had taken refuge in the fort, and only surrendered it on\r\nthe express stipulation that she and the other princesses should pass out\r\nsafe from the dishonor of search, was, in violation of this condition,\r\nand at the base suggestion of Mr. Hastings himself, [Footnote: In his\r\nletter to the Commanding Officer at Bidgegur. The following are the terms\r\nin which he conveys the hint: \"I apprehend that she will contrive to\r\ndefraud the captors of a considerable part of the booty, by being\r\nsuffered to retire _without examination_. But this is your\r\nconsideration, and not mine. I should be very sorry that your officers\r\nand soldiers lost any part of the reward to which they are so well\r\nentitled; but I cannot make any objection, as you must be the best judge\r\nof the expediency of the _promised_ indulgence to the Rannee.\"]\r\nrudely examined and despoiled of all her effects. The Governor-General,\r\nhowever, in this one instance, incurred the full odium of iniquity\r\nwithout reaping any of its reward. The treasures found in the castle of\r\nthe Rajah were inconsiderable, and the soldiers, who had shown themselves\r\nso docile in receiving the lessons of plunder, were found inflexibly\r\nobstinate in refusing to admit their instructor to a share. Disappointed,\r\ntherefore, in the primary object of his expedition, the Governor-General\r\nlooked round for some richer harvest of rapine, and the Begums of Oude\r\npresented themselves as the most convenient victims. These Princesses,\r\nthe mother and grandmother of the reigning Nabob of Oude, had been left\r\nby the late sovereign in possession of certain government-estates, or\r\njaghires, as well as of all the treasure that was in his hands at the\r\ntime of his death, and which the orientalized imaginations of the English\r\nexaggerated to an enormous sum. The present Nabob had evidently looked\r\nwith an eye of cupidity on this wealth, and had been guilty of some acts\r\nof extortion towards his female relatives, in consequence of which the\r\nEnglish government had interfered between them,--and had even guaranteed\r\nto the mother of the Nabob the safe possession of her property, without\r\nany further encroachment whatever. Guarantees and treaties, however, were\r\nbut cobwebs in the way of Mr. Hastings; and on his failure at Benares, he\r\nlost no time in concluding an agreement with the Nabob, by which (in\r\nconsideration of certain measures of relief to his dominions) this Prince\r\nwas bound to plunder his mother and grandmother of all their property,\r\nand place it at the disposal of the Governor-General. In order to give a\r\ncolor of justice to this proceeding, it was [Footnote: \"It was the\r\npractice of Mr. Hastings (says Burke, in his fine speech on Mr. Pitt's\r\nIndia Bill, March 22, 1786) to examine the country, and wherever he found\r\nmoney to affix guilt. A more dreadful fault could not be alleged against\r\na native than that he was rich.\"] pretended that these Princesses had\r\ntaken advantage of the late insurrection at Benares, to excite a similar\r\nspirit of revolt in Oude against the reigning Nabob and the English\r\ngovernment. As Law is but too often, in such cases, the ready accomplice\r\nof Tyranny, the services of the Chief Justice, Sir Elijah Impey, were\r\ncalled in to sustain the accusations; and the wretched mockery was\r\nexhibited of a Judge travelling about in search of evidence, [Footnote:\r\nThis journey of the Chief Justice in search of evidence is thus happily\r\ndescribed by Sheridan in the Speech:--\"When, on the 28th of November, he\r\nwas busied at Lucknow on that honorable business, and when, three days\r\nafter, he was found at Chunar, at the distance of 200 miles, still\r\nsearching for affidavits, and, like Hamlet's ghost, exclaiming, 'Swear,'\r\nhis progress on that occasion was so whimsically rapid, compared with the\r\ngravity of his employ, that an observer would be tempted to quote again\r\nfrom the same scene, 'Ha! Old Truepenny, canst thou mole so fast i' the\r\nground?' Here, however, the comparison ceased; for, when Sir Elijah made\r\nhis visit to Lucknow 'to whet the almost blunted purpose' of the Nabob,\r\nhis language was wholly different from that of the poet--for it would\r\nhave been totally against his purpose to have said,\r\n\r\n  Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive\r\n  Against thy mother aught.\"] for the express purpose of proving a\r\ncharge, upon which judgment had been pronounced and punishment decreed\r\nalready.\r\n\r\nThe Nabob himself, though sufficiently ready to make the wealth of those\r\nvenerable ladies occasionally minister to his wants, yet shrunk back,\r\nwith natural reluctance, from the summary task now imposed upon him; and\r\nit was not till after repeated and peremptory remonstrances from Mr.\r\nHastings, that he could be induced to put himself at the head of a body\r\nof English troops, and take possession, by unresisted force, of the town\r\nand palace of these Princesses. As the treasure, however, was still\r\nsecure in the apartments of the women,--that circle, within which even the\r\nspirit of English rapine did not venture,--an expedient was adopted to\r\nget over this inconvenient delicacy. Two aged eunuchs of high rank and\r\ndistinction, the confidential agents of the Begums, were thrown into\r\nprison, and subjected to a course of starvation and torture, by which it\r\nwas hoped that the feelings of their mistresses might be worked upon, and\r\na more speedy surrender of their treasure wrung from them. The plan\r\nsucceeded:--upwards of 500,000_l_. was procured to recruit the\r\nfinances of the Company; and thus, according to the usual course of\r\nBritish power in India, rapacity but levied its contributions in one\r\nquarter, to enable war to pursue its desolating career in another.\r\n\r\nTo crown all, one of the chief articles of the treaty, by which the Nabob\r\nwas reluctantly induced to concur in these atrocious measures, was, as\r\nsoon as the object had been gained, infringed by Mr. Hastings, who, in a\r\nletter to his colleagues in the government, honestly confesses that the\r\nconcession of that article was only a fraudulent artifice of diplomacy,\r\nand never intended to be carried into effect.\r\n\r\nSuch is an outline of the case, which, with all its aggravating details,\r\nMr. Sheridan had to state in these two memorable Speeches; and it was\r\ncertainly most fortunate for the display of his peculiar powers, that\r\nthis should be the Charge confided to his management. For, not only was\r\nit the strongest, and susceptible of the highest charge of coloring, but\r\nit had also the advantage of grouping together all the principal\r\ndelinquents of the trial, and affording a gradation of hue, from the\r\nshowy and prominent enormities of the Governor-General and Sir Elijah\r\nImpey in the front of the picture, to the subordinate and half-tint\r\niniquity of the Middletons and Bristows in the back-ground.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke, it appears, had at first reserved this grand part in the drama\r\nof the Impeachment for himself; but, finding that Sheridan had also fixed\r\nhis mind upon it, he, without hesitation, resigned it into his hands;\r\nthus proving the sincerity of his zeal in the cause, [Footnote: Of the\r\nlengths to which this zeal could sometimes carry his fancy and language,\r\nrather, perhaps, than his actual feelings, the following anecdote is a\r\nremarkable proof. On one of the days of the trial, Lord ----, who was\r\nthen a boy, having been introduced by a relative into the Manager's box,\r\nBurke said to him, \"I am glad to see you here--I shall be still gladder\r\nto see you there--(pointing to the Peers' seats) I hope you will be _in\r\nat the death_--I should like to _blood_ you.\"] by sacrificing\r\neven the vanity of talent to its success.\r\n\r\nThe following letters from him, relative to the Impeachment, will be read\r\nwith interest. The first is addressed to Mrs. Sheridan, and was written,\r\nI think, early in the proceedings; the second is to Sheridan himself:--\r\n\r\n\"MADAM,\r\n\r\n\"I am sure you will have the goodness to excuse the liberty I take with\r\nyou, when you consider the interest which I have and which the Public\r\nhave (the said Public being, at least, half an inch a taller person than\r\nI am) in the use of Mr. Sheridan's abilities. I know that his mind is\r\nseldom unemployed; but then, like all such great and vigorous minds, it\r\ntakes an eagle flight by itself, and we can hardly bring it to rustle\r\nalong the ground, with us birds of meaner wing, in coveys. I only beg\r\nthat you will prevail on Mr. Sheridan to be with us _this day_, at\r\nhalf after three, in the Committee. Mr. Wombell, the Paymaster of Oude,\r\nis to be examined there _to-day_. Oude is Mr. Sheridan's particular\r\nprovince; and I do most seriously ask that he would favor us with his\r\nassistance. What will come of the examination I know not; but, without\r\nhim, I do not expect a great deal from it; with him, I fancy we may get\r\nout something material. Once more let me entreat your interest with Mr.\r\nSheridan and your forgiveness for being troublesome to you, and do me the\r\njustice to believe me, with the most sincere respect,\r\n\r\n\"Madam, your most obedient\r\n\r\n\"and faithful humble Servant,\r\n\r\n_\"Thursday, 9 o'clock._\r\n\r\n\"EDM. BURKE.\"\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"You have only to wish to be excused to succeed in your wishes; for,\r\nindeed, he must be a great enemy to himself who can consent, on account\r\nof a momentary ill-humor, to keep himself at a distance from you.\r\n\r\n\"Well, all will turn out right,--and half of you, or a quarter, is worth\r\nfive other men. I think that this cause, which was originally yours, will\r\nbe recognized by you, and that you will again possess yourself of it. The\r\nowner's mark is on it, and all our docking and cropping cannot hinder its\r\nbeing known and cherished by its original master. My most humble respects\r\nto Mrs. Sheridan. I am happy to find that she takes in good part the\r\nliberty I presumed to take with her. Grey has done much and will do every\r\nthing. It is a pity that he is not always toned to the full extent of his\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\n\"Most truly yours,\r\n\r\n_\"Monday._\r\n\r\n\"EDM. BURKE.\r\n\r\n\"I feel a little sickish at the approaching day. I have read much--too\r\nmuch, perhaps,--and, in truth, am but poorly prepared. Many things, too,\r\nhave broken in upon me.\" [Footnote: For this letter, as well as some\r\nother valuable communications, I am indebted to the kindness of Mr.\r\nBurgess,--the Solicitor and friend of Sheridan during the last twenty\r\nyears of his life.]\r\n\r\nThough a Report, however accurate, must always do injustice to that\r\neffective kind of oratory which is intended rather to be heard than read,\r\nand, though frequently, the passages that most roused and interested the\r\nhearer, are those that seem afterwards the tritest and least animated to\r\nthe reader, [Footnote: The converse assertion is almost equally true. Mr.\r\nFox used to ask of a printed speech, \"Does it read well?\" and, if\r\nanswered in the affirmative, said, \"Then it was a bad speech.\"] yet, with\r\nall this disadvantage, the celebrated oration in question so well\r\nsustains its reputation in the perusal, that it would be injustice,\r\nhaving an authentic Report in my possession, not to produce some\r\nspecimens of its style and spirit.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his exordium, after dwelling upon the great importance\r\nof the inquiry in which they were engaged, and disclaiming for himself\r\nand his brother-managers any feeling of personal malice against the\r\ndefendant, or any motive but that of retrieving the honor of the British\r\nname in India, and bringing down punishment upon those whose inhumanity\r\nand injustice had disgraced it,--he thus proceeds to conciliate the Court\r\nby a warm tribute to the purity of English justice:--\r\n\r\n\"However, when I have said this, I trust Your Lordships will not believe\r\nthat, because something is necessary to retrieve the British character,\r\nwe call for an example to be made, without due and solid proof of the\r\nguilt of the person whom we pursue:--no, my Lords, we know well that it\r\nis the glory of this Constitution, that not the general fame or character\r\nof any man--not the weight or power of any prosecutor--no plea of moral\r\nor political expediencey--not even the secret consciousness of guilt,\r\nwhich may live in the bosom of the Judge, can justify any British Court\r\nin passing any sentence, to touch a hair of the head, or an atom in any\r\nrespect, of the property, of the fame, of the liberty of the poorest or\r\nmeanest subject that breathes the air of this just and free land. We\r\nknow, my Lords, that there can be no legal guilt without legal proof, and\r\nthat the rule which defines the evidence is as much the law of the land\r\nas that which creates the crime. It is upon that ground we mean to stand.\"\r\n\r\nAmong those ready equivocations and disavowals, to which Mr. Hastings had\r\nrecourse upon every emergency, and in which practice seems to have\r\nrendered him as shameless as expert, the step which he took with regard\r\nto his own defence during the trial was not the least remarkable for\r\npromptness and audacity. He had, at the commencement of the prosecution,\r\ndelivered at the bar of the House of Commons, as his own, a written\r\nrefutation of the charges then pending against him in that House,\r\ndeclaring at the same time, that \"if truth could tend to convict him, he\r\nwas content to be, himself, the channel to convey it.\" Afterwards,\r\nhowever, on finding that he had committed himself rather imprudently in\r\nthis defence, he came forward to disclaim it at the bar of the House of\r\nLords, and brought his friend Major Scott to prove that it had been drawn\r\nup by Messrs. Shore, Middleton, &c. &c.--that he himself had not even\r\nseen it, and therefore ought not to be held accountable for its contents.\r\nIn adverting to this extraordinary evasion, Mr. Sheridan thus shrewdly\r\nand playfully exposes all the persons concerned in it:--\r\n\r\n\"Major Scott comes to your bar--describes the shortness of\r\ntime--represents Mr. Hastings as it were _contracting for_ a\r\ncharacter--putting his memory _into commission_--making\r\n_departments_ for his conscience. A number of friends meet together,\r\nand he, knowing (no doubt) that the accusation of the Commons had been\r\ndrawn up by a Committee, thought it necessary, as a point of punctilio,\r\nto answer it by a Committee also. One furnishes the raw material of fact,\r\nthe second spins the argument, and the third twines up the conclusion;\r\nwhile Mr. Hastings, with a master's eye, is cheering and looking over\r\nthis loom. He says to one, 'You have got my good faith in your\r\nhands--_you_, my veracity to manage. Mr. Shore, I hope you will make\r\nme a good financier--Mr. Middleton, you have my humanity in\r\ncommission.'--When it is done, he brings it to the House of Commons, and\r\nsays, 'I was equal to the task. I knew the difficulties, but I scorn\r\nthem: here is the truth, and if the truth will convict me, I am content\r\nmyself to be the channel of it.' His friends hold up their heads, and\r\nsay, 'What noble magnanimity! This must be the effect of conscious and\r\nreal innocence.' Well, it is so received, it is so argued upon,--but it\r\nfails of its effect.\r\n\r\n\"Then says Mr. Hastings,--'That my defence! no, mere\r\njourneyman-work,--good enough for the Commons, but not fit for Your\r\nLordships' consideration.' He then calls upon his Counsel to save\r\nhim:--'I fear none of my accusers' witnesses--I know some of them well--I\r\nknow the weakness of their memory, and the strength of their\r\nattachment--I fear no testimony but my own--save me from the peril of my\r\nown panegyric--preserve me from that, and I shall be safe.' Then is this\r\nplea brought to Your Lordships' bar, and Major Scott gravely\r\nasserts,--that Mr. Hastings did, at the bar of the House of Commons,\r\nvouch for facts of which he was ignorant, and for arguments which he had\r\nnever read.\r\n\r\n\"After such an attempt, we certainly are left in doubt to decide, to\r\n_which_ set of his friends Mr. Hastings is least obliged, those who\r\nassisted him in making his defence, or those who advised him to deny it.\"\r\n\r\nHe thus describes the feelings of the people of the East with respect to\r\nthe unapproachable sanctity of their Zenanas:--\r\n\r\n\"It is too much, I am afraid, the case, that persons, used to European\r\nmanners, do not take up these sort of considerations at first with the\r\nseriousness that is necessary. For Your Lordships cannot even learn the\r\nright nature of those people's feelings and prejudices from any history\r\nof other Mahometan countries,--not even from that of the Turks, for they\r\nare a mean and degraded race in comparison with many of these great\r\nfamilies, who, inheriting from their Persian ancestors, preserve a purer\r\nstyle of prejudice and a loftier superstition. Women there are not as in\r\nTurkey--they neither go to the mosque nor to the bath--it is not the thin\r\nveil alone that hides them--but in the inmost recesses of their Zenana\r\nthey are kept from public view by those reverenced and protected walls,\r\nwhich, as Mr. Hastings and Sir Elijah Impey admit, are held sacred even\r\nby the ruffian hand of war or by the more uncourteous hand of the law.\r\nBut, in this situation, they are not confined from a mean and selfish\r\npolicy of man--not from a coarse and sensual jealousy--enshrined rather\r\nthan immured, their habitation and retreat is a sanctuary, not a\r\nprison--their jealousy is their own--a jealousy of their own honor, that\r\nleads them to regard liberty as a degradation, and the gaze of even\r\nadmiring eyes as inexpiable pollution to the purity of their fame and the\r\nsanctity of their honor.\r\n\r\n\"Such being the general opinion (or prejudices, let them be called) of\r\nthis country, Your Lordships will find, that whatever treasures were\r\ngiven or lodged in a Zenana of this description must, upon the evidence\r\nof the thing itself, be placed beyond the reach of resumption. To dispute\r\nwith the Counsel about the original right to those treasures--to talk of\r\na title to them by the Mahometan law!--their title to them is the title\r\nof a Saint to the relics upon an altar, placed there by Piety, [Footnote:\r\nThis metaphor was rather roughly handled afterwards (1794) by Mr. Law,\r\none of the adverse Counsel, who asked, how could the Begum be considered\r\nas \"a Saint,\" or how were the camels, which formed part of the treasure,\r\nto be \"placed upon the altar?\" Sheridan, in reply, said, \"It was the\r\nfirst time in his life he had ever heard of _special pleading_ on a\r\n_metaphor_, or a _bill of indictment_ against a trope. But such\r\nwas the turn of the learned Counsel's mind, that, when he attempted to be\r\nhumorous, no jest could be found, and, when serious, no fact was\r\nvisible.\"] guarded by holy Superstition, and to be snatched from thence\r\nonly by Sacrilege.\"\r\n\r\nIn showing that the Nabob was driven to this robbery of his relatives by\r\nother considerations than those of the pretended rebellion, which was\r\nafterwards conjured up by Mr. Hastings to justify it, he says,--\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, that through all his defences--through all his various\r\nfalse suggestions--through all these various rebellions and\r\ndisaffections, Mr. Hastings never once lets go this plea--of\r\nextinguishable right in the Nabob. He constantly represents the seizing\r\nthe treasures as a resumption of a right which he could not part\r\nwith;--as if there were literally something in the Koran, that made it\r\ncriminal in a true Mussulman to keep his engagements with his relations,\r\nand impious in a son to abstain from plundering his mother. I do gravely\r\nassure your Lordships that there is no such doctrine in the Koran, and no\r\nsuch principle makes a part in the civil or municipal jurisprudence of\r\nthat country. Even after these Princesses had been endeavoring to\r\ndethrone the Nabob and to extirpate the English, the only plea the Nabob\r\never makes, is his right under the Mahometan law; and the truth is, he\r\nappears never to have heard any other reason, and I pledge myself to make\r\nit appear to Your Lordships, however extraordinary it may be, that not\r\nonly had the Nabob never heard of the rebellion till the moment of\r\nseizing the palace, but, still further, that he never heard of it at\r\nall--that this extraordinary rebellion, which was as notorious as the\r\nrebellion of 1745 in London, was carefully concealed from those two\r\nparties--the Begums who plotted it, and the Nabob who was to be the\r\nvictim of it.\r\n\r\n\"The existence of this rebellion was not the secret, but the notoriety of\r\nit was the secret; it was a rebellion which had for its object the\r\ndestruction of no human creature but those who planned it;--it was a\r\nrebellion which, according to Mr. Middleton's expression, no man, either\r\nhorse or foot, ever marched to quell. The Chief Justice was the only man\r\nwho took the field against it,--the force against which it was raised,\r\ninstantly withdrew to give it elbow-room,--and, even then, it was a\r\nrebellion which perversely showed itself in acts of hospitality to the\r\nNabob whom it was to dethrone, and to the English whom it was to\r\nextirpate;--it was a rebellion plotted by two feeble old women, headed by\r\ntwo eunuchs, and suppressed by an affidavit.\"\r\n\r\nThe acceptance, or rather exaction, of the private present of £100,000 is\r\nthus animadverted upon:\r\n\r\n\"My Lords, such was the distressed situation of the Nabob about a\r\ntwelvemonth before Mr. Hastings met him at Chunar. It was a twelvemonth,\r\nI say, after this miserable scene--a mighty period in the progress of\r\nBritish rapacity--it was (if the Counsel will) after some natural\r\ncalamities had aided the superior vigor of British violence and\r\nrapacity--it was after the country had felt other calamities besides the\r\nEnglish--it was after the angry dispensations of Providence had, with a\r\nprogressive severity of chastisement, visited the land with a famine one\r\nyear, and with a Col. Hannay the next--it was after he, this Hannay, had\r\nreturned to retrace the steps of his former ravages--it was after he and\r\nhis voracious crew had come to plunder ruins which himself had made, and\r\nto glean from desolation the little that famine had spared, or rapine\r\noverlooked;--_then_ it was that this miserable bankrupt prince\r\nmarching through his country, besieged by the clamors of his starving\r\nsubjects, who cried to him for protection through their cages--meeting\r\nthe curses of some of his subjects, and the prayers of others--with\r\nfamine at his heels, and reproach following him,--then it was that this\r\nPrince is represented as exercising this act of prodigal bounty to the\r\nvery man whom he here reproaches--to the very man whose policy had\r\nextinguished his power, and whose creatures had desolated his country. To\r\ntalk of a free-will gift! it is audacious and ridiculous to name the\r\nsupposition. It was _not_ a free-will gift. What was it then? was it\r\na bribe? or was it extortion? I shall prove it was both--it was an act of\r\ngross bribery and of rank extortion.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he thus adverts to this present:--\r\n\r\n\"The first thing he does is, to leave Calcutta, in order to go to the\r\nrelief of the distressed Nabob. The second thing, is to take 100,000_l_\r\nfrom that distressed Nabob on account of the distressed Company. And the\r\nthird thing is to ask of the distressed Company this very same sum on\r\naccount of the distresses of Mr. Hastings. There never were three\r\ndistresses that seemed so little reconcilable with one another.\"\r\n\r\nAnticipating the plea of state-necessity, which might possibly be set up\r\nin defence of the measures of the Governor-General, he breaks out into\r\nthe following rhetorical passage:--\r\n\r\n\"State necessity! no, my Lords; that imperial tyrant, _State\r\nNecessity_, is yet a generous despot,--bold is his demeanor, rapid his\r\ndecisions, and terrible his grasp. But what he does, my Lords, he dares\r\navow, and avowing, scorns any other justification, than the great motives\r\nthat placed the iron sceptre in his hand. But a quibbling, pilfering,\r\nprevaricating State-Necessity, that tries to skulk behind the skirts of\r\nJustice;--a State-Necessity that tries to steal a pitiful justification\r\nfrom whispered accusations and fabricated rumors. No, my Lords, that is\r\nno State Necessity;--tear off the mask, and you see coarse, vulgar\r\navarice,--you see speculation, lurking under the gaudy disguise, and\r\nadding the guilt of libelling the public honor to its own private fraud.\r\n\r\n\"My Lords, I say this, because I am sure the Managers would make every\r\nallowance that state-necessity could claim upon any great emergency. If\r\nany great man in bearing the arms of this country;--if any Admiral,\r\nbearing the vengeance and the glory of Britain to distant coasts, should\r\nbe compelled to some rash acts of violence, in order, perhaps, to give\r\nfood to those who are shedding their blood for Britain;--if any great\r\nGeneral, defending some fortress, barren itself, perhaps, but a pledge of\r\nthe pride, and, with the pride, of the power of Britain; if such a man\r\nwere to * * * while he himself was * * at the top, like an eagle besieged\r\nin its imperial nest; [Footnote: The Reporter, at many of these passages,\r\nseems to have thrown aside his pen in despair.]--would the Commons of\r\nEngland come to accuse or to arraign such acts of state-necessity? No.\"\r\n\r\nIn describing that swarm of English pensioners and placemen, who were\r\nstill, in violation of the late purchased treaty, left to prey on the\r\nfinances of the Nabob, he says,--\r\n\r\n\"Here we find they were left, as heavy a weight upon the Nabob as\r\never,--left there with as keen an appetite, though not so clamorous. They\r\nwere reclining on the roots and shades of that spacious tree, which their\r\npredecessors had stripped branch and bough--watching with eager eyes the\r\nfirst budding of a future prosperity, and of the opening harvest which\r\nthey considered as the prey of their perseverance and rapacity.\"\r\n\r\nWe have in the close of the following passage, a specimen of that lofty\r\nstyle, in which, as if under the influence of Eastern associations,\r\nalmost all the Managers of this Trial occasionally indulged: [Footnote:\r\nMuch of this, however, is to be set down to the gratuitous bombast of the\r\nReporter. Mr. Fox, for instance, is made to say, \"Yes, my Lords, happy is\r\nit for the world, that the penetrating gaze of Providence searches after\r\nman, and in the dark den where he has stifled the remonstrances of\r\nconscience darts his compulsatory ray, that, bursting the secrecy of\r\nguilt, drives the criminal frantic to confession and expiation.\"\r\n_History of the Trial._--Even one of the Counsel, Mr. Dallas, is\r\nrepresented as having caught this Oriental contagion, to such a degree as\r\nto express himself in the following manner:--\"We are now, however, (said\r\nthe Counsel,) advancing from the star-light of Circumstance to the\r\nday-light of Discovery: the sun of Certainty is melting the darkness,\r\nand--we are arrived at facts admitted by both parties!\"]--\r\n\r\n\"I do not mean to say that Mr. Middleton had _direct_ instructions\r\nfrom Mr. Hastings,--that he told him to go and give that fallacious\r\nassurance to the Nabob,--that he had that order _under his hand_.\r\nNo, but in looking attentively over Mr. Middleton's correspondence, you\r\nwill find him say, upon a more important occasion, 'I don't expect your\r\npublic authority for this;--it is enough if you but _hint_ your\r\npleasure.' He knew him well; he could interpret every nod and motion of\r\nthat head; he understood the glances of that eye which sealed the\r\nperdition of nations, and at whose throne Princes waited, in pale\r\nexpectation, for their fortune or their doom.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is one of those labored passages, of which the orator\r\nhimself was perhaps most proud, but in which the effort to be eloquent is\r\ntoo visible, and the effect, accordingly, falls short of the pretension:--\r\n\r\n\"You see how Truth--empowered by that will which gives a giant's nerve to\r\nan infant's arm--has burst the monstrous mass of fraud that has\r\nendeavored to suppress it.--It calls now to Your Lordships, in the weak\r\nbut clear tone of that Cherub, Innocence, whose voice is more persuasive\r\nthan eloquence, more convincing than argument, whose look is\r\nsupplication, whose tone is conviction,--it calls upon you for redress,\r\nit calls upon you for vengeance upon the oppressor, and points its\r\nheaven-directed hand to the detested, but unrepenting author of its\r\nwrongs!\"\r\n\r\nHis description of the desolation brought upon some provinces of Oude by\r\nthe misgovernment of Colonel Hannay, and of the insurrection at\r\nGoruckpore against that officer in consequence, is, perhaps, the most\r\nmasterly portion of the whole speech:--\r\n\r\n\"If we could suppose a person to have come suddenly into the country\r\nunacquainted with any circumstances that had passed since the days of\r\nSujah ul Dowlah, he would naturally ask--what cruel hand has wrought this\r\nwide desolation, what barbarian foe has invaded the country, has\r\ndesolated its fields, depopulated its villages? He would ask, what\r\ndisputed succession, civil rage, or frenzy of the inhabitants, had\r\ninduced them to act in hostility to the words of God, and the beauteous\r\nworks of man? He would ask what religious zeal or frenzy had added to the\r\nmad despair and horrors of war? The ruin is unlike any thing that appears\r\nrecorded in any age; it looks like neither the barbarities of men, nor\r\nthe judgments of vindictive heaven. There is a waste of desolation, as if\r\ncaused by fell destroyers, never meaning to return and making but a short\r\nperiod of their rapacity. It looks as if some fabled monster had made its\r\npassage through the country, whose pestiferous breath had blasted more\r\nthan its voracious appetite could devour.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there had been any men in the country, who had not their hearts and\r\nsouls so subdued by fear, as to refuse to speak the truth at all upon\r\nsuch a subject, they would have told him, there had been no war since the\r\ntime of Sujah ul Dowlah,--tyrant, indeed, as he was, but then deeply\r\nregretted by his subjects--that no hostile blow of any enemy had been\r\nstruck in that land--that there had been no disputed succession--no civil\r\nwar--no religious frenzy. But that these were the tokens of British\r\nfriendship, the marks left by the embraces of British allies--more\r\ndreadful than the blows of the bitterest enemy. They would tell him that\r\nthese allies had converted a prince into a slave, to make him the\r\nprincipal in the extortion upon his subjects;--that their rapacity\r\nincreased in proportion as the means of supplying their avarice\r\ndiminished; that they made the sovereign pay as if they had a right to an\r\nincreased price, because the labor of extortion and plunder increased. To\r\nsuch causes, they would tell him, these calamities were owing.\r\n\r\n\"Need I refer Your Lordships to the strong testimony of Major Naylor when\r\nhe rescued Colonel Hannay from their hands--where you see that this\r\npeople, born to submission and bent to most abject subjection--that even\r\nthey, in whose meek hearts injury had never yet begot resentment, nor\r\neven despair bred courage--that _their_ hatred, _their_\r\nabhorrence of Colonel Hannay was such that they clung round him by\r\nthousands and thousands;--that when Major Naylor rescued him, they\r\nrefused life from the hand that could rescue Hannay;--that they nourished\r\nthis desperate consolation, that by their death they should at least thin\r\nthe number of wretches who suffered by his devastation and extortion. He\r\nsays that, when he crossed the river, he found the poor wretches\r\nquivering upon the parched banks of the polluted river, encouraging their\r\nblood to flow, and consoling themselves with the thought, that it would\r\nnot sink into the earth, but rise to the common God of humanity, and cry\r\naloud for vengeance on their destroyers!--This warm description--which is\r\nno declamation of mine, but founded in actual fact, and in fair, clear\r\nproof before Your Lordships--speaks powerfully what the cause of these\r\noppressions were, and the perfect justness of those feelings that were\r\noccasioned by them. And yet, my Lords, I am asked to prove _why_\r\nthese people arose in such concert:--'there must have been machinations,\r\nforsooth, and the Begums' machinations, to produce all this!'--Why did\r\nthey rise!--Because they were people in human shape; because patience\r\nunder the detested tyranny of man is rebellion to the sovereignty of God;\r\nbecause allegiance to that Power that gives us the _forms_ of men\r\ncommands us to maintain the _rights_ of men. And never yet was this\r\ntruth dismissed from the human heart--never in any time, in any\r\nage--never in any clime, where rude man ever had any social feeling, or\r\nwhere corrupt refinement had subdued all feelings,--never was this one\r\nunextinguishable truth destroyed from the heart of man, placed, as it is,\r\nin the core and centre of it by his Maker, that man was not made the\r\nproperty of man; that human power is a trust for human benefit and that\r\nwhen it is abused, revenge becomes justice, if not the bounden duty of\r\nthe injured! These, my Lords, were the causes why these people rose.\"\r\n\r\nAnother passage in the second day's speech is remarkable, as exhibiting a\r\nsort of tourney of intellect between Sheridan and Burke, and in that\r\nfield of abstract speculation, which was the favorite arena of the\r\nlatter. Mr. Burke had, in opening the prosecution, remarked, that\r\nprudence is a quality incompatible with vice, and can never be\r\neffectively enlisted in its cause:--\"I never (said he) knew a man who was\r\nbad, fit for _service_ that was good. There is always some\r\ndisqualifying ingredient, mixing and spoiling the compound. The man seems\r\nparalytic on that side, his muscles there have lost their very tone and\r\ncharacter--they cannot move. In short, the accomplishment of any thing\r\ngood is a physical impossibility for such a man. There is decrepitude as\r\nwell as distortion: he could not, if he would, is not more certain than\r\nthat he would not, if he could.\" To this sentiment the allusions in the\r\nfollowing passage refer:--\r\n\r\n\"I am perfectly convinced that there is one idea, which must arise in\r\nYour Lordships' minds as a subject of wonder,--how a person of Mr.\r\nHastings' reputed abilities can furnish such matter of accusation against\r\nhimself. For, it must be admitted that never was there a person who seems\r\nto go so rashly to work, with such an arrogant appearance of contempt for\r\nall conclusions, that may be deduced from what he advances upon the\r\nsubject. When he seems most earnest and laborious to defend himself, it\r\nappears as if he had but one idea uppermost in his mind--a determination\r\nnot to care what he says, provided he keeps clear of fact. He knows that\r\ntruth must convict him, and concludes, _à converso_, that falsehood\r\nwill acquit him; forgetting that there must be some connection, some\r\nsystem, some co-operation, or, otherwise, his host of falsities fall\r\nwithout an enemy, self-discomfited and destroyed. But of this he never\r\nseems to have had the slightest apprehension. He falls to work, an\r\nartificer of fraud, against all the rules of architecture;--he lays his\r\nornamental work first, and his massy foundation at the top of it; and\r\nthus his whole building tumbles upon his head. Other people look well to\r\ntheir ground, choose their position, and watch whether they are likely to\r\nbe surprised there; but he, as if in the ostentation of his heart, builds\r\nupon a precipice, and encamps upon a mine, from choice. He seems to have\r\nno one actuating principle, but a steady, persevering resolution not to\r\nspeak the truth or to tell the fact.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible almost to treat conduct of this kind with perfect\r\nseriousness; yet I am aware that it ought to be more seriously accounted\r\nfor--because I am sure it has been a sort of paradox, which must have\r\nstruck Your Lordships, how any person having so many motives to\r\nconceal--having so many reasons to dread detection--should yet go to work\r\nso clumsily upon the subject. It is possible, indeed, that it may raise\r\nthis doubt--whether such a person is of sound mind enough to be a proper\r\nobject of punishment; or at least it may give a kind of confused notion,\r\nthat the guilt cannot be of so deep and black a grain, over which such a\r\nthin veil was thrown, and so little trouble taken to avoid detection. I\r\nam aware that, to account for this seeming paradox, historians, poets,\r\nand even philosophers--at least of ancient times--have adopted the\r\nsuperstitious solution of the vulgar, and said that the gods deprive men\r\nof reason whom they devote to destruction or to punishment. But to\r\nunassuming or unprejudiced reason, there is no need to resort to any\r\nsupposed supernatural interference; for the solution will be found in the\r\neternal rules that formed the mind of man, and gave a quality and nature\r\nto every passion that inhabits in it.\r\n\r\n\"An Honorable friend of mine, who is now, I believe, near me,--a\r\ngentleman, to whom I never can on any occasion refer without feelings of\r\nrespect, and, on this subject, without feelings of the most grateful\r\nhomage;--a gentleman, whose abilities upon this occasion, as upon some\r\nformer ones, happily for the glory of the age in which we live, are not\r\nentrusted merely to the perishable eloquence of the day, but will live to\r\nbe the admiration of that hour when all of us are mute, and most of us\r\nforgotten;--that Honorable gentleman has told you that Prudence, the\r\nfirst of virtues, never can be used in the cause of vice. If, reluctant\r\nand diffident, I might take such a liberty, I should express a doubt,\r\nwhether experience, observation, or history, will warrant us in fully\r\nassenting to this observation. It is a noble and a lovely sentiment, my\r\nLords, worthy the mind of him who uttered it, worthy that proud disdain,\r\nthat generous scorn of the means and instruments of vice, which virtue\r\nand genius must ever feel. But I should doubt whether we can read the\r\nhistory of a Philip of Macedon, a Caesar, or a Cromwell, without\r\nconfessing, that there have been evil purposes, baneful to the peace and\r\nto the rights of men, conducted--if I may not say, with prudence or with\r\nwisdom--yet with awful craft and most successful and commanding subtlety.\r\nIf, however, I might make a distinction, I should say that it is the\r\nproud attempt to mix a _variety_ of lordly crimes, that unsettles\r\nthe prudence of the mind, and breeds this distraction of the brain.\r\n\r\n\"_One_ master-passion, domineering in the breast, may win the\r\nfaculties of the understanding to advance its purpose, and to direct to\r\nthat object every thing that thought or human knowledge can effect; but,\r\nto succeed, it must maintain a solitary despotism in the mind;--each\r\nrival profligacy must stand aloof, or wait in abject vassalage upon its\r\nthrone. For, the Power, that has not forbad the entrance of evil passions\r\ninto man's mind, has, at least, forbad their union;--if they meet they\r\ndefeat their object, and their conquest, or their attempt at it, is\r\ntumult. Turn to the Virtues--how different the decree! Formed to connect,\r\nto blend, to associate, and to cooperate; bearing the same course, with\r\nkindred energies and harmonious sympathy, each perfect in its own lovely\r\nsphere, each moving in its wider or more contracted orbit, with\r\ndifferent, but concentering, powers, guided by the same influence of\r\nreason, and endeavoring at the same blessed end--the happiness of the\r\nindividual, the harmony of the species, and the glory of the Creator. In\r\nthe Vices, on the other hand, it is the discord that insures the\r\ndefeat--each clamors to be heard in its own barbarous language; each\r\nclaims the exclusive cunning of the brain; each thwarts and reproaches\r\nthe other; and even while their fell rage assails with common hate the\r\npeace and virtue of the world, the civil war among their own tumultuous\r\nlegions defeats the purpose of the foul conspiracy. These are the Furies\r\nof the mind, my Lords, that unsettle the understanding; these are the\r\nFuries, that destroy the virtue, Prudence,--while the distracted brain\r\nand shivered intellect proclaim the tumult that is within, and bear their\r\ntestimonies, from the mouth of God himself, to the foul condition of the\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\nThe part of the Speech which occupied the Third Day (and which was\r\ninterrupted by the sudden indisposition of Mr. Sheridan) consists chiefly\r\nof comments upon the affidavits taken before Sir Elijah Impey,--in which\r\nthe irrelevance and inconsistency of these documents is shrewdly exposed,\r\nand the dryness of detail, inseparable from such a task, enlivened by\r\nthose light touches of conversational humor, and all that by-play of\r\neloquence of which Mr. Sheridan was such a consummate master. But it was\r\non the Fourth Day of the oration that he rose into his most ambitious\r\nflights, and produced some of those dazzling bursts of declamation, of\r\nwhich the traditional fame is most vividly preserved. Among the audience\r\nof that day was Gibbon, and the mention of his name in the following\r\npassage not only produced its effect at the moment, but, as connected\r\nwith literary anecdote, will make the passage itself long memorable.\r\nPolitics are of the day, but literature is of all time--and, though it\r\nwas in the power of the orator, in his brief moment of triumph, to throw\r\na lustre over the historian by a passing epithet, [Footnote: Gibbon\r\nhimself thought it an event worthy of record in his Memoirs. \"Before my\r\ndeparture from England (he says) I was present at the august spectacle of\r\nMr. Hastings's Trial in Westminster Hall. It was not my province to\r\nabsolve or condemn the Governor of India, but Mr. Sheridan's eloquence\r\ndemanded my applause, nor could I hear without emotion the personal\r\ncompliment which he paid me in the presence of the British nation. From\r\nthis display of genius, which blazed four successive days,\" &c &c.] the\r\nname of the latter will, at the long run, pay back the honor with\r\ninterest. Having reprobated the violence and perfidy of the\r\nGovernor-General, in forcing the Nabob to plunder his own relatives and\r\nfriends, he adds:--\r\n\r\n\"I do say, that if you search the history of the world, you will not find\r\nan act of tyranny and fraud to surpass this; if you read all past\r\nhistories, peruse the Annals of Tacitus, read the luminous page of\r\nGibbon, and all the ancient and modern writers, that have searched into\r\nthe depravity of former ages to draw a lesson for the present, you will\r\nnot find an act of treacherous, deliberate, cool cruelty that could\r\nexceed this.\"\r\n\r\nOn being asked by some honest brother Whig, at the conclusion of the\r\nSpeech, how he came to compliment Gibbon with the epithet \"luminous,\"\r\nSheridan answered in a half whisper, \"I said '_vo_luminous.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the simile of the vulture and the lamb, which\r\noccurs in the address of Rolla to the Peruvians, had been previously\r\nemployed by Mr. Sheridan, in this speech; and it showed a degree of\r\nindifference to criticism,--which criticism, it must be owned, not\r\nunfrequently deserves,--to reproduce before the public an image, so\r\nnotorious both from its application and its success. But, called upon, as\r\nhe was, to levy, for the use of that Drama, a hasty conscription of\r\nphrases and images, all of a certain altitude and pomp, this veteran\r\nsimile, he thought, might be pressed into the service among the rest. The\r\npassage of the Speech in which it occurs is left imperfect in the\r\nReport:--\r\n\r\n\"This is the character of all the protection ever afforded to the allies\r\nof Britain under the government of Mr. Hastings. They send their troops\r\nto drain the produce of industry, to seize all the treasures, wealth, and\r\nprosperity of the country, and then they call it Protection!--it is the\r\nprotection of the vulture to the lamb. * * *\"\r\n\r\nThe following is his celebrated delineation of Filial Affection, to which\r\nreference is more frequently made than to any other part of the\r\nSpeech;--though the gross inaccuracy of the printed Report has done its\r\nutmost to belie the reputation of the original passage, or rather has\r\nsubstituted a changeling to inherit its fame.\r\n\r\n\"When I see in many of these letters the infirmities of age made a\r\nsubject of mockery and ridicule; when I see the feelings of a son treated\r\nby Mr. Middleton as puerile and contemptible; when I see an order given\r\nby Mr. Hastings to harden that son's heart, to choke the struggling\r\nnature in his bosom; when I see them pointing to the son's name, and to\r\nhis standard while marching to oppress the mother, as to a banner that\r\ngives dignity, that gives a holy sanction and a reverence to their\r\nenterprise; when I see and hear these things done--when I hear them\r\nbrought into three deliberate Defences set up against the Charges of the\r\nCommons--my Lords, I own I grow puzzled and confounded, and almost begin\r\nto doubt whether, where such a defence can be offered, it may not be\r\ntolerated.\r\n\r\n\"And yet, my Lords, how can I support the claim of filial love by\r\nargument--much less the affection of a son to a mother--where love loses\r\nits awe, and veneration is mixed with tenderness? What can I say upon\r\nsuch a subject, what can I do but repeat the ready truths which, with the\r\nquick impulse of the mind, must spring to the lips of every man on such a\r\ntheme? Filial love! the morality of instinct, the sacrament of nature and\r\nduty--or rather let me say it is miscalled a duty, for it flows from the\r\nheart without effort, and is its delight, its indulgence, its enjoyment.\r\nIt is guided, not by the slow dictates of reason; it awaits not\r\nencouragement from reflection or from thought; it asks no aid of memory;\r\nit is an innate, but active, consciousness of having been the object of a\r\nthousand tender solicitudes, a thousand waking watchful cares, of meek\r\nanxiety and patient sacrifices unremarked and unrequited by the object.\r\nIt is a gratitude founded upon a conviction of obligations, not\r\nremembered, but the more binding because not remembered,--because\r\nconferred before the tender reason could acknowledge, or the infant\r\nmemory record them--a gratitude and affection, which no circumstances\r\nshould subdue, and which few can strengthen; a gratitude, in which even\r\ninjury from the object, though it may blend regret, should never breed\r\nresentment; an affection which can be increased only by the decay of\r\nthose to whom we owe it, and which is then most fervent when the\r\ntremulous voice of age, resistless in its feebleness, inquires for the\r\nnatural protector of its cold decline.\r\n\r\n\"If these are the general sentiments of man, what must be their\r\ndepravity, what must be their degeneracy, who can blot out and erase from\r\nthe bosom the virtue that is deepest rooted in the human heart, and\r\ntwined within the cords of life itself--aliens from nature, apostates\r\nfrom humanity! And yet, if there is a crime more fell, more foul--if\r\nthere is any thing worse than a wilful persecutor of his mother--it is to\r\nsee a deliberate, reasoning instigator and abettor to the deed:--this it\r\nis that shocks, disgusts, and appals the mind more than the other--to\r\nview, not a wilful parricide, but a parricide by compulsion, a miserable\r\nwretch, not actuated by the stubborn evils of his own worthless heart,\r\nnot driven by the fury of his own distracted brain, but lending his\r\nsacrilegious hand, without any malice of his own, to answer the abandoned\r\npurposes of the human fiends that have subdued his will!--To condemn\r\ncrimes like these, we need not talk of laws or of human rules--their\r\nfoulness, their deformity does not depend upon local constitutions, upon\r\nhuman institutes or religious creeds:--they are crimes--and the persons\r\nwho perpetrate them are monsters who violate the primitive condition,\r\nupon which the earth was given to man--they are guilty by the general\r\nverdict of human kind.\"\r\n\r\nIn some of the sarcasms we are reminded of the quaint contrasts of his\r\ndramatic style. Thus:--\r\n\r\n\"I must also do credit to them whenever I see any thing like lenity in\r\nMr. Middleton or his agent:--they do seem to admit here, that it was not\r\nworth while to commit a massacre for the discount of a small note of\r\nhand, and to put two thousand women and children to death, in order to\r\nprocure prompt payment.\"\r\n\r\nOf the length to which the language of crimination was carried, as well\r\nby Mr. Sheridan as by Mr. Burke, one example, out of many, will suffice.\r\nIt cannot fail, however, to be remarked that, while the denunciations and\r\ninvectives of Burke are filled throughout with a passionate earnestness,\r\nwhich leaves no doubt as to the sincerity of the hate and anger professed\r\nby him,--in Sheridan, whose nature was of a much gentler cast, the\r\nvehemence is evidently more in the words than in the feeling, the tone of\r\nindignation is theatrical and assumed, and the brightness of the flash\r\nseems to be more considered than the destructiveness of the fire:--\r\n\r\n\"It is this circumstance of deliberation and consciousness of his\r\nguilt--it is this that inflames the minds of those who watch his\r\ntransactions, and roots out all pity for a person who could act under\r\nsuch an influence. We conceive of such tyrants as Caligula and Nero, bred\r\nup to tyranny and oppression, having had no equals to control them--no\r\nmoment for reflection--we conceive that, if it could have been possible\r\nto seize the guilty profligates for a moment, you might bring conviction\r\nto their hearts and repentance to their minds. But when you see a cool,\r\nreasoning, deliberate tyrant--one who was not born and bred to\r\narrogance,--who has been nursed in a mercantile line--who has been used\r\nto look round among his fellow-subjects--to transact business with his\r\nequals--to account for conduct to his master, and, by that wise system of\r\nthe Company, to detail all his transactions--who never could fly one\r\nmoment from himself, but must be obliged every night to sit down and hold\r\nup a glass to his own soul--who could never be blind to his deformity,\r\nand who must have brought his conscience not only to connive at but to\r\napprove of it--_this_ it is that distinguishes it from the worst\r\ncruelties, the worst enormities of those, who, born to tyranny, and\r\nfinding no superior, no adviser, have gone to the last presumption that\r\nthere were none above to control them hereafter. This is a circumstance\r\nthat aggravates the whole of the guilt of the unfortunate gentleman we\r\nare now arraigning at your bar.\"\r\n\r\nWe now come to the Peroration, in which, skilfully and without appearance\r\nof design, it is contrived that the same sort of appeal to the purity of\r\nBritish justice, with which the oration opened, should, like the\r\nrepetition of a solemn strain of music, recur at its close,--leaving in\r\nthe minds of the Judges a composed and concentrated feeling of the great\r\npublic duty they had to perform, in deciding upon the arraignment of\r\nguilt brought before them. The Court of Directors, it appeared, had\r\nordered an inquiry into the conduct of the Begums, with a view to the\r\nrestitution of their property, if it should appear that the charges\r\nagainst them were unfounded; but to this proceeding Mr. Hastings\r\nobjected, on the ground that the Begums themselves had not called for\r\nsuch interference in their favor, and that it was inconsistent with the\r\n\"Majesty of Justice\" to condescend to volunteer her services. The pompous\r\nand Jesuitical style in which this singular doctrine [Footnote: \"If\r\nnothing (says Mr. Mill) remained to stain the reputation of Mr. Hastings\r\nbut the principles avowed in this singular pleading, his character, among\r\nthe friends of justice, would be sufficiently determined.\"] is expressed,\r\nin a letter addressed by the Governor-general to Mr. Macpherson, is thus\r\ningeniously turned to account by the orator, in winding up his masterly\r\nstatement to a close:--\r\n\r\n'And now before I come to the last magnificent paragraph, let me call the\r\nattention of those who, possibly, think themselves capable of judging of\r\nthe dignity and character of justice in this country;--let me call the\r\nattention of those who, arrogantly perhaps, presume that they understand\r\nwhat the features, what the duties of justice are here and in India;--let\r\nthem learn a lesson from this great statesman, this enlarged, this\r\nliberal philosopher:--'I hope I shall not depart from the simplicity of\r\nofficial language, in saying that the Majesty of Justice ought to be\r\napproached with solicitation, not descend to provoke or invite it, much\r\nless to debase itself by the suggestion of wrongs and the promise of\r\nredress, with the denunciation of punishment before trial, and even\r\nbefore accusation.' This is the exhortation which Mr. Hastings makes to\r\nhis counsel. This is the character which he gives of British justice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"But I will ask Your Lordships, do you approve this representation? Do\r\nyou feel that this is the true image of Justice? Is this the character of\r\nBritish justice? Are these her features? Is this her countenance? Is this\r\nher gait or her mien? No, I think even now I hear you calling upon me to\r\nturn from this vile libel, this base caricature, this Indian pagod,\r\nformed by the hand of guilty and knavish tyranny, to dupe the heart of\r\nignorance,--to turn from this deformed idol to the true Majesty of\r\nJustice here. _Here_, indeed, I see a different form, enthroned by\r\nthe sovereign hand of Freedom,--awful without severity--commanding\r\nwithout pride--vigilant and active without restlessness or\r\nsuspicion--searching and inquisitive without meanness or debasement--not\r\narrogantly scorning to stoop to the voice of afflicted innocence, and in\r\nits loveliest attitude when bending to uplift the suppliant at its feet.\r\n\r\n\"It is by the majesty, by the form of that Justice, that I do conjure and\r\nimplore Your Lordships to give your minds to this great business; that I\r\nexhort you to look, not so much to words, which may be denied or quibbled\r\naway, but to the plain facts,--to weigh and consider the testimony in\r\nyour own minds: we know the result must be inevitable. Let the truth\r\nappear and our cause is gained. It is this, I conjure Your Lordships, for\r\nyour own honor, for the honor of the nation, for the honor of human\r\nnature, now entrusted to your care,--it is this duty that the Commons of\r\nEngland, speaking through us, claims at your hands.\r\n\r\n\"They exhort you to it by every thing that calls sublimely upon the heart\r\nof man, by the Majesty of that Justice which this bold man has libelled,\r\nby the wide fame of your own tribunal, by the sacred pledge by which you\r\nswear in the solemn hour of decision, knowing that that decision will\r\nthen bring you the highest reward that ever blessed the heart of man, the\r\nconsciousness of having done the greatest act of mercy for the world,\r\nthat the earth has ever yet received from any hand but Heaven.--My Lords,\r\nI have done.\"\r\n\r\nThough I have selected some of the most remarkable passages of this\r\nSpeech, [Footnote: I had selected many more, but must confess that they\r\nappeared to me, when in print, so little worthy of the reputation of the\r\nSpeech, that I thought it would be, on the whole, more prudent to omit\r\nthem. Even of the passages, here cited, I speak rather from my\r\nimagination of what they must have been, than from my actual feeling of\r\nwhat they are. The character, given of such Reports, by Lord\r\nLoughborough, is, no doubt, but too just. On a motion made by Lord\r\nStanhope, (April 29, 1794), that the short-hand writers, employed on\r\nHastings's trial, should be summoned to the bar of the House, to read\r\ntheir minutes, Lord Loughborough, in the course of his observations on\r\nthe motion, said, \"God forbid that ever their Lordships should call on\r\nthe short-hand writers to publish their notes; for, of all people,\r\nshort-hand writers were ever the farthest from correctness, and there\r\nwere no man's words they ever heard that they again returned. They were\r\nin general ignorant, as acting mechanically; and by not considering the\r\nantecedent, and catching the sound, and not the sense, they perverted the\r\nsense of the speaker, and made him appear as ignorant as themselves.\"] it\r\nwould be unfair to judge of it even from these specimens. A Report,\r\n_verbatim_, of any effective speech must always appear diffuse and\r\nungraceful in the perusal. The very repetitions, the redundancy, the\r\naccumulation of epithets which gave force and momentum in the career of\r\ndelivery, but weaken and encumber the march of the style, when read.\r\nThere is, indeed, the same sort of difference between a faithful\r\nshort-hand Report, and those abridged and polished records which Burke\r\nhas left us of his speeches, as there is between a cast taken directly\r\nfrom the face, (where every line is accurately preserved, but all the\r\nblemishes and excrescences are in rigid preservation also,) and a model,\r\nover which the correcting hand has passed, and all that was minute or\r\nsuperfluous is generalized and softened away.\r\n\r\nNeither was it in such rhetorical passages as abound, perhaps, rather\r\nlavishly, in this Speech, that the chief strength of Mr. Sheridan's\r\ntalent lay. Good sense and wit were the great weapons of his\r\noratory--shrewdness in detecting the weak points of an adversary, and\r\ninfinite powers of raillery in exposing it. These were faculties which he\r\npossessed in a greater degree than any of his contemporaries; and so well\r\ndid he himself know the stronghold of his powers, that it was but rarely,\r\nafter this display in Westminster Hall, that he was tempted to leave it\r\nfor the higher flights of oratory, or to wander after Sense into that\r\nregion of metaphor, where too often, like Angelica in the enchanted\r\npalace of Atlante, she is sought for in vain. [Footnote: Curran used to\r\nsay laughingly, \"When I can't talk sense, I talk metaphor.\"] His\r\nattempts, indeed, at the florid or figurative style, whether in his\r\nspeeches or his writings, were seldom very successful. That luxuriance of\r\nfancy, which in Burke was natural and indigenous, was in him rather a\r\nforced and exotic growth. It is a remarkable proof of this difference\r\nbetween them, that while, in the memorandums of speeches left behind by\r\nBurke, we find, that the points of argument and business were those which\r\nhe prepared, trusting to the ever ready wardrobe of his fancy for their\r\nadornment,--in Mr. Sheridan's notes it is chiefly the decorative\r\npassages, that are worked up beforehand to their full polish; while on\r\nthe resources of his good sense, ingenuity, and temper, he seems to have\r\nrelied for the management of his reasonings and facts. Hence naturally it\r\narises that the images of Burke, being called up on the instant, like\r\nspirits, to perform the bidding of his argument, minister to it\r\nthroughout, with an almost coordinate agency; while the figurative\r\nfancies of Sheridan, already prepared for the occasion, and brought forth\r\nto adorn, not assist, the business of the discourse, resemble rather\r\nthose sprites which the magicians used to keep inclosed in phials, to be\r\nproduced for a momentary enchantment, and then shut up again.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the similes and illustrations of Burke form such an intimate,\r\nand often essential, part of his reasoning, that if the whole strength of\r\nthe Samson does not lie in those luxuriant locks, it would at least be\r\nconsiderably diminished by their loss. Whereas, in the Speech of Mr.\r\nSheridan, which we have just been considering, there is hardly one of the\r\nrhetorical ornaments that might not be detached, without, in any great\r\ndegree, injuring the force of the general statement. Another consequence\r\nof this difference between them is observable in their respective modes\r\nof transition, from what may be called the _business_ of a speech\r\nits more generalized and rhetorical parts. When Sheridan rises, his\r\nelevation is not sufficiently prepared; he starts abruptly and at once\r\nfrom the level of his statement, and sinks down into it again with the\r\nsame suddenness. But Burke, whose imagination never allows even business\r\nto subside into mere prose, sustains a pitch throughout which accustoms\r\nthe mind to wonder, and, while it prepares us to accompany him in his\r\nboldest flights, makes us, even when he walks, still feel that he has\r\nwings:--\r\n\r\n  \"_Même quand l'oiseau marche, on sent qu'il a des ailes._\"\r\n\r\nThe sincerity of the praises bestowed by Burke on the Speech of his\r\nbrother Manager has sometimes been questioned, but upon no sufficient\r\ngrounds. His zeal for the success of the Impeachment, no doubt, had a\r\nconsiderable share in the enthusiasm, with which this great effort in its\r\nfavor filled him. It may be granted, too, that, in admiring the\r\napostrophes that variegate this speech, he was, in some degree, enamored\r\nof a reflection of himself;\r\n\r\n  \"_Cunctaque miratur, quibus est mirabilis ipse._\"\r\n\r\n  He sees reflected there, in fainter light.\r\n  All that combines to make himself so bright.\r\n\r\nBut whatever mixture of other motives there may have been in the feeling,\r\nit is certain that his admiration of the Speech was real and unbounded.\r\nHe is said to have exclaimed to Mr. Fox, during the delivery of some\r\npassages of it, \"There,--that is the true style;--something between\r\npoetry and prose, and better than either.\" The severer taste of Mr. Fox\r\ndissented, as might be expected, from this remark. He replied, that \"he\r\nthought such a mixture was for the advantage of neither--as producing\r\npoetic prose, or, still worse, prosaic poetry.\" It was, indeed, the\r\nopinion of Mr. Fox, that the impression made upon Burke by these somewhat\r\ntoo theatrical tirades is observable in the change that subsequently took\r\nplace in his own style of writing; and that the florid and less chastened\r\ntaste which some persons discover in his later productions, may all be\r\ntraced to the example of this speech. However this may be, or whether\r\nthere is really much difference, as to taste, between the youthful and\r\nsparkling vision of the Queen of France in 1792, and the interview\r\nbetween the Angel and Lord Bathurst in 1775, it is surely a most unjust\r\ndisparagement of the eloquence of Burke, to apply to it, at any time of\r\nhis life, the epithet \"flowery,\"--a designation only applicable to that\r\nordinary ambition of style, whose chief display, by necessity, consists\r\nof ornament without thought, and pomp without substance. A succession of\r\nbright images, clothed in simple, transparent language,--even when, as in\r\nBurke, they \"crowd upon the aching sense\" too dazzlingly,--should never\r\nbe confounded with that mere verbal opulence of style, which mistakes the\r\nglare of words for the glitter of ideas, and, like the Helen of the\r\nsculptor Lysippus, makes finery supply the place of beauty. The\r\nfigurative definition of eloquence in the Book of Proverbs--\"Apples of\r\ngold in a net-work of silver\"--is peculiarly applicable to that\r\nenshrinement of rich, solid thoughts in clear and shining language, which\r\nis the triumph of the imaginative class of writers and orators,--while,\r\nperhaps, the net-work, _without_ the gold inclosed, is a type\r\nequally significant of what is called \"flowery\" eloquence.\r\n\r\nIt is also, I think, a mistake, however flattering to my country, to call\r\nthe School of Oratory, to which Burke belongs, _Irish_. That\r\nIrishmen are naturally more gifted with those stores of fancy, from which\r\nthe illumination of this high order of the art must be supplied, the\r\nnames of Burke, Grattan, Sheridan, Curran, Canning, and Plunkett,\r\nabundantly testify. Yet had Lord Chatham, before any of these great\r\nspeakers were heard, led the way, in the same animated and figured strain\r\nof oratory; [Footnote: His few noble sentences on the privilege of the\r\npoor man's cottage are universally known. There is also his fanciful\r\nallusion to the confluence of the Saone and Rhone, the traditional\r\nreports of which vary, both as to the exact terms in which it was\r\nexpressed, and the persons to whom he applied it. Even Lord Orford does\r\nnot seem to have ascertained the latter point. To these may be added the\r\nfollowing specimen:--\"I don't inquire from what quarter the wind cometh,\r\nbut whither it goeth; and, if any measure that comes from the Right\r\nHonorable Gentleman tends to the public good, my bark is ready.\" Of a\r\ndifferent kind is that grand passage,--\"America, they tell me, has\r\nresisted--I rejoice to hear it,\"--which Mr. Grattan used to pronounce\r\nfiner than anything in Demosthenes.] while another Englishman, Lord\r\nBacon, by making Fancy the hand-maid of Philosophy, had long since set an\r\nexample of that union of the imaginative and the solid, which, both in\r\nwriting and in speaking, forms the characteristic distinction of this\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThe Speech of Mr. Sheridan in Westminster Hall, though so much inferior\r\nin the opinion of Mr. Fox and others, to that which he had delivered on\r\nthe same subject in the House of Commons, seems to have produced, at the\r\ntime, even a more lively and general sensation;--possibly from the nature\r\nand numerousness of the assembly before which it was spoken, and which\r\ncounted among its multitude a number of that sex, whose lips are in\r\ngeneral found to be the most rapid conductors of fame.\r\n\r\nBut there was _one_ of this sex, more immediately interested in his\r\nglory, who seems to have felt it as women alone can feel. \"I have delayed\r\nwriting,\" says Mrs. Sheridan, in a letter to her sister-in-law, dated\r\nfour days after the termination of the Speech, \"till I could gratify\r\nmyself and you by sending you the news of our dear Dick's triumph!--of\r\n_our_ triumph I may call it; for surely, no one, in the slightest\r\ndegree connected with him, but must feel proud and happy. It is\r\nimpossible, my dear woman, to convey to you the delight, the\r\nastonishment, the adoration, he has excited in the breasts of every class\r\nof people! Every party-prejudice has been overcome by a display of\r\ngenius, eloquence and goodness, which no one with any thing like a heart\r\nabout them, could have listened to without being the wiser and the better\r\nfor the rest of their lives. What must _my_ feelings be!--you can\r\nonly imagine. To tell you the truth, it is with some difficulty that I\r\ncan 'let down my mind,' as Mr. Burke said afterwards, to talk or think on\r\nany other subject. But pleasure, too exquisite, becomes pain, and I am at\r\nthis moment suffering for the delightful anxieties of last week.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a most happy combination when the wife of a man of genius unites\r\nintellect enough to appreciate the talents of her husband, with the\r\nquick, feminine sensibility, that can thus passionately feel his success.\r\nPliny tells us, that his Calpurnia, whenever he pleaded an important\r\ncause, had messengers ready to report to her every murmur of applause\r\nthat he received; and the poet Statius, in alluding to his own victories\r\nat the Albanian Games, mentions the \"breathless kisses,\" with which his\r\nwife, Claudia, used to cover the triumphal garlands he brought home. Mrs.\r\nSheridan may well take her place beside these Roman wives;--and she had\r\nanother resemblance to one of them, which was no less womanly and\r\nattractive. Not only did Calpurnia sympathize with the glory of her\r\nhusband abroad, but she could also, like Mrs. Sheridan, add a charm to\r\nhis talents at home, by setting his verses to music and singing them to\r\nher harp,--\"with no instructor,\" adds Pliny, \"but Love, who is, after\r\nall, the best master.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter of Mrs. Sheridan thus proceeds:--\"You were perhaps alarmed by\r\nthe account of S.'s illness in the papers; but I have the pleasure to\r\nassure you he is now perfectly well, and I hope by next week we shall be\r\nquietly settled in the country, and suffered to repose, in every sense of\r\nthe word; for indeed we have, both of us, been in a constant state of\r\nagitation, of one kind or other, for some time back.\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad to hear your father continues so well. Surely he must\r\nfeel happy and proud of such a son. I take it for granted you see the\r\nnewspapers: I assure you the accounts in them are not exaggerated, and\r\nonly echo the exclamation of admiration that is in every body's mouth. I\r\nmake no excuse for dwelling on this subject: I know you will not find it\r\ntedious. God bless you--I am an invalid at present, and not able to write\r\nlong letters.\"\r\n\r\nThe agitation and want of repose, which Mrs. Sheridan here complains of,\r\narose not only from the anxiety which she so deeply felt, for the success\r\nof this great public effort of her husband, but from the share which she\r\nherself had taken, in the labor and attention necessary to prepare him\r\nfor it. The mind of Sheridan being, from the circumstances of his\r\neducation and life, but scantily informed upon all subjects for which\r\nreading is necessary, required, of course, considerable training and\r\nfeeding, before it could venture to grapple with any new or important\r\ntask. He has been known to say frankly to his political friends, when\r\ninvited to take part in some question that depended upon authorities,\r\n\"You know I'm an ignoramus--but here I am--instruct me and I'll do my\r\nbest.\" It is said that the stock of numerical lore, upon which he\r\nventured to set up as the Aristarchus of Mr. Pitt's financial plans, was\r\nthe result of three weeks' hard study of arithmetic, to which he doomed\r\nhimself, in the early part of his Parliamentary career, on the chance of\r\nbeing appointed, some time or other, Chancellor of the Exchequer. For\r\nfinancial display it must be owned that this was rather a crude\r\npreparation. But there are other subjects of oratory, on which the\r\noutpourings of information, newly acquired, may have a freshness and\r\nvivacity which it would be vain to expect, in the communication of\r\nknowledge that has lain long in the mind, and lost in circumstantial\r\nspirit what it has gained in general mellowness. They, indeed, who have\r\nbeen regularly disciplined in learning, may be not only too familiar with\r\nwhat they know to communicate it with much liveliness to others, but too\r\napt also to rely upon the resources of the memory, and upon those cold\r\noutlines which it retains of knowledge whose details are faded. The\r\nnatural consequence of all this is that persons, the best furnished with\r\ngeneral information, are often the most vague and unimpressive on\r\nparticular subjects; while, on the contrary, an uninstructed man of\r\ngenius, like Sheridan, who approaches a topic of importance for the first\r\ntime, has not only the stimulus of ambition and curiosity to aid him in\r\nmastering its details, but the novelty of first impressions to brighten\r\nhis general views of it--and, with a fancy thus freshly excited, himself,\r\nis most sure to touch and rouse the imaginations of others.\r\n\r\nThis was particularly the situation of Mr. Sheridan with respect to the\r\nhistory of Indian affairs; and there remain among his papers numerous\r\nproofs of the labor which his preparation for this arduous task cost not\r\nonly himself but Mrs. Sheridan. Among others, there is a large pamphlet\r\nof Mr. Hastings, consisting of more than two hundred pages, copied out\r\nneatly in her writing, with some assistance from another female hand. The\r\nindustry, indeed, of all around him was put in requisition for this great\r\noccasion--some, busy with the pen and scissors, making extracts--some\r\npasting and stitching his scattered memorandums in their places. So that\r\nthere was hardly a single member of the family that could not boast of\r\nhaving contributed his share, to the mechanical construction of this\r\nspeech. The pride of its success was, of course, equally participated;\r\nand Edwards, a favorite servant of Mr. Sheridan, who lived with him many\r\nyears, was long celebrated for his professed imitation of the manner in\r\nwhich his master delivered (what seems to have struck Edwards as the\r\nfinest part of the speech) his closing words, \"My Lords, I have done!\"\r\n\r\nThe impeachment of Warren Hastings is one of those pageants in the drama\r\nof public life, which show how fleeting are the labors and triumphs of\r\npoliticians--\"what shadows they are, and what shadows they pursue.\" When\r\nwe consider the importance which the great actors in that scene attached\r\nto it,--the grandeur with which their eloquence invested the cause, as\r\none in which the liberties and rights of the whole human race were\r\ninterested,--and then think how all that splendid array of Law and of\r\ntalent has dwindled away, in the view of most persons at present, into an\r\nunworthy and harassing persecution of a meritorious and successful\r\nstatesman;--how those passionate appeals to justice, those vehement\r\ndenunciations of crime, which made the halls of Westminster and St.\r\nStephen's ring with their echoes, are now coldly judged, through the\r\nmedium of disfiguring Reports, and regarded, at the best, but as\r\nrhetorical effusions, indebted to temper for their warmth, and to fancy\r\nfor their details;--while so little was the reputation of the delinquent\r\nhimself even scorched by the bolts of eloquence thus launched at him,\r\nthat a subsequent House of Commons thought themselves honored by his\r\npresence, and welcomed him with such cheers [Footnote: When called as a\r\nwitness before the House, in 1813, on the subject of the renewal of the\r\nEast India Company's Charter.] as should reward only the friends and\r\nbenefactors of freedom;--when we reflect on this thankless result of so\r\nmuch labor and talent, it seems wonderful that there should still be\r\nfound high and gifted spirits, to waste themselves away in such temporary\r\nstruggles, and, like that spendthrift of genius, Sheridan, to\r\n_discount_ their immortality, for the payment of fame in hand which\r\nthese triumphs of the day secure to them.\r\n\r\nFor this direction, however, which the current of opinion has taken, with\r\nregard to Mr. Hastings and his eloquent accusers, there are many very\r\nobvious reasons to be assigned. Success, as I have already remarked, was\r\nthe dazzling talisman, which he waved in the eyes of his adversaries from\r\nthe first, and which his friends have made use of to throw a splendor\r\nover his tyranny and injustice ever since. [Footnote: In the important\r\narticle of Finance, however, for which he made so many sacrifices of\r\nhumanity, even the justification of success was wanting to his measures.\r\nThe following is the account given by the Select Committee of the House\r\nof Commons in 1810, of the state in which India was left by his\r\nadministration:--\"The revenues had been absorbed; the pay and allowances\r\nof both the civil and military branches of the service were greatly in\r\narrear; the credit of the Company was extremely depressed; and, added to\r\nall, the whole system had fallen into such irregularity and confusion,\r\nthat the real state of affairs could not be _ascertained_ till the\r\nconclusion of the year 1785-6.\"--_Third Report_.] Too often in the\r\nmoral logic of this world, it matters but little what the premises of\r\nconduct may be, so the conclusion but turns out showy and prosperous.\r\nThere is also, it must be owned, among the English, (as perhaps, among\r\nall free people,) a strong taste for the arbitrary, when they themselves\r\nare not to be the victims of it, which invariably secures to such\r\naccomplished despotisms, as that of Lord Strafford in Ireland, and\r\nHastings in India, even a larger share of their admiration than they are,\r\nthemselves, always willing to allow.\r\n\r\nThe rhetorical exaggerations, in which the Managers of the prosecution\r\nindulged,--Mr. Sheridan, from imagination, luxuriating in its own\r\ndisplay, and Burke from the same cause, added to his overpowering\r\nautocracy of temper--were but too much calculated to throw suspicion on\r\nthe cause in which they were employed, and to produce a reaction in favor\r\nof the person whom they were meant to overwhelm. \"_Rogo vos,\r\nJudices_,\"--Mr. Hastings might well have said,--\"_si iste disertus\r\nest, ideo me damnari oportet?_\" [Footnote: Seneca, Controvers. lib.\r\niii. c. 19.]\r\n\r\nThere are also, without doubt, considerable allowances to be made, for\r\nthe difficult situations in which Mr. Hastings was placed, and those\r\nimpulses to wrong which acted upon him from all sides--allowances which\r\nwill have more or less weight with the judgment, according as it may be\r\nmore or less fastidiously disposed, in letting excuses for rapine and\r\noppression pass muster. The incessant and urgent demands of the Directors\r\nupon him for money may palliate, perhaps, the violence of those methods\r\nwhich he took to procure it for them; and the obstruction to his policy\r\nwhich would have arisen from a strict observance of Treaties, may be\r\nadmitted, by the same gentle casuistry, as an apology for his frequent\r\ninfractions of them.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration to be taken into account, in our estimate of the\r\ncharacter of Mr. Hastings as a ruler, is that strong light of publicity,\r\nwhich the practice in India of carrying on the business of government by\r\nwritten documents threw on all the machinery of his measures,\r\ndeliberative as well as executive. These Minutes, indeed, form a record\r\nof fluctuation and inconsistency--not only on the part of the\r\nGovernor-General, but of all the members of the government--a sort of\r\nweather-cock diary of opinions and principles, shifting with the\r\ninterests or convenience of the moment, [Footnote: Instances of this, on\r\nthe part of Mr. Hastings, are numberless. In remarking upon his corrupt\r\ntransfer of the management of the Nabob's household in 1778, the\r\nDirectors say, \"It is with equal surprise and concern that we observe\r\nthis request introduced, and the Nabob's ostensible rights so solemnly\r\nasserted at this period by our Governor-General; because, on a late\r\noccasion, to serve a very different purpose, he has not scrupled to\r\ndeclare it as visible as the light of the sun, that the Nabob is a mere\r\npageant, and without even the shadow of authority.\" On another\r\ntransaction in 1781, Mr. Mill remarks:--\"It is a curious moral spectacle\r\nto compare the minutes and letters of the Governor-General, when, at the\r\nbeginning of the year 1780, maintaining the propriety of condemning the\r\nNabob to sustain the whole of the burden imposed upon him, and his\r\nminutes and letters maintaining the propriety of relieving him from those\r\nburthens in 1781. The arguments and facts adduced on the one occasion, as\r\nwell as the conclusion, are a flat contradiction to those exhibited on\r\nthe other.\"] which entirely takes away our respect even for success, when\r\nissuing out of such a chaos of self-contradiction and shuffling. It\r\ncannot be denied, however, that such a system of exposure--submitted, as\r\nit was in this case, to a still further scrutiny, under the bold,\r\ndenuding hands of a Burke and a Sheridan--was a test to which the\r\ncouncils of few rulers could with impunity be brought. Where, indeed, is\r\nthe statesman that could bear to have his obliquities thus chronicled? or\r\nwhere is the Cabinet that would not shrink from such an inroad of light\r\ninto its recesses?\r\n\r\nThe undefined nature, too, of that power which the Company exercised in\r\nIndia, and the uncertain state of the Law, vibrating between the English\r\nand the Hindoo codes, left such tempting openings for injustice as it was\r\nhardly possible to resist. With no public opinion to warn off authority\r\nfrom encroachment, and with the precedents set up by former rulers all\r\npointing the wrong way, it would have been difficult, perhaps, for even\r\nmore moderate men than Hastings, not occasionally to break bounds and go\r\ncontinually astray.\r\n\r\nTo all these considerations in his favor is to be added the apparently\r\ntriumphant fact, that his government was popular among the natives of\r\nIndia, and that his name is still remembered by them with gratitude and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nAllowing Mr. Hastings, however, the full advantage of these and other\r\nstrong pleas in his defence, it is yet impossible, for any real lover of\r\njustice and humanity, to read the plainest and least exaggerated history\r\nof his government, [Footnote: Nothing can be more partial and misleading\r\nthan the coloring given to these transactions by Mr. Nicholls and other\r\napologists of Hastings. For the view which I have myself taken of the\r\nwhole case I am chiefly indebted to the able History of British India by\r\nMr. Mill--whose industrious research and clear analytical statements make\r\nhim the most valuable authority that can be consulted on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe mood of mind in which Mr. Nicholls listened to the proceedings of the\r\nImpeachment may be judged from the following declaration, which he has\r\nhad the courage to promulgate to the public:--\"On this Charge (the Begum\r\nCharge) Mr. Sheridan made a speech, which both sides of the House\r\nprofessed greatly to admire--for Mr. Pitt now openly approved of the\r\nImpeachment. _I will acknowledge, that I did not admire this speech of\r\nMr. Sheridan.\"_] without feeling deep indignation excited at almost\r\nevery page of it. His predecessors had, it is true, been guilty of wrongs\r\nas glaring--the treachery of Lord Clive to Omichund in 1757, and the\r\nabandonment of Ramnarain to Meer Causim under the administration of Mr.\r\nVansittart, are stains upon the British character which no talents or\r\nglory can do away. There are precedents, indeed, to be found, through the\r\nannals of our Indian empire, for the formation of the most perfect code\r\nof tyranny, in every department, legislative, judicial, and executive,\r\nthat ever entered into the dreams of intoxicated power. But, while the\r\npractice of Mr. Hastings was, at least, as tyrannical as that of his\r\npredecessors, the principles upon which he founded that practice were\r\nstill more odious and unpardonable. In his manner, indeed, of defending\r\nhimself he is his own worst accuser--as there is no outrage of power, no\r\nviolation of faith, that might not be justified by the versatile and\r\nambidextrous doctrines, the lessons of deceit and rules of rapine, which\r\nhe so ably illustrated by his measures, and has so shamelessly recorded\r\nwith his pen.\r\n\r\nNothing but an early and deep initiation in the corrupting school of\r\nIndian politics could have produced the facility with which, as occasion\r\nrequired, he could belie his own recorded assertions, turn hostilely\r\nround upon his own expressed opinions, disclaim the proxies which he\r\nhimself had delegated, and, in short, get rid of all the inconveniences\r\nof personal identity, by never acknowledging himself to be bound by any\r\nengagement or opinion which himself had formed. To select the worst\r\nfeatures of his Administration is no very easy task; but the calculating\r\ncruelty with which he abetted the extermination of the Rohillas--his\r\nunjust and precipitate execution of Nuncomar, who had stood forth as his\r\naccuser, and, therefore, became his victim,--his violent aggression upon\r\nthe Raja of Benares, and that combination of public and private rapacity,\r\nwhich is exhibited in the details of his conduct to the royal family of\r\nOude;--these are acts, proved by the testimony of himself and his\r\naccomplices, from the disgrace of which no formal acquittal upon points\r\nof law can absolve him, and whose guilt the allowances of charity may\r\nextenuate, but never can remove. That the perpetrator of such deeds\r\nshould have been popular among the natives of India only proves how low\r\nwas the standard of justice, to which the entire tenor of our policy had\r\naccustomed them;--but that a ruler of this character should be held up to\r\nadmiration in England, is one of those anomalies with which England, more\r\nthan any other nation, abounds, and only inclines us to wonder that the\r\ntrue worship of Liberty should so long have continued to flourish in a\r\ncountry, where such heresies to her sacred cause are found.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt so long upon the circumstances and nature of this Trial, not\r\nonly on account of the conspicuous place which it occupies in the\r\nfore-ground of Mr. Sheridan's life, but because of that general interest\r\nwhich an observer of our Institutions must take in it, from the clearness\r\nwith which it brought into view some of their best and worst features.\r\nWhile, on one side, we perceive the weight of the popular scale, in the\r\nlead taken, upon an occasion of such solemnity and importance, by two\r\npersons brought forward from the middle ranks of society into the very\r\nvan of political distinction and influence, on the other hand, in the\r\nsympathy and favor extended by the Court to the practical assertor of\r\ndespotic principles, we trace the prevalence of that feeling, which,\r\nsince the commencement of the late King's reign, has made the Throne the\r\nrallying point of all that are unfriendly to the cause of freedom. Again,\r\nin considering the conduct of the Crown Lawyers during the Trial--the\r\nnarrow and irrational rules of evidence which they sought to\r\nestablish--the unconstitutional control assumed by the Judges, over the\r\ndecisions of the tribunal before which the cause was tried, and the\r\nrefusal to communicate the reasons upon which those decisions were\r\nfounded--above all, too, the legal opinions expressed on the great\r\nquestion relative to the abatement of an Impeachment by Dissolution, in\r\nwhich almost the whole body of lawyers [Footnote: Among the rest, Lord\r\nErskine, who allowed his profession, on this occasion, to stand in the\r\nlight of his judgment. \"As to a Nisi-prius lawyer (said Burke) giving an\r\nopinion on the duration of an Impeachment--as well might a rabbit, that\r\nbreeds six times a year, pretend to know any thing of the gestation of an\r\nelephant.\"] took the wrong, the pedantic, and the unstatesmanlike side of\r\nthe question,--while in all these indications of the spirit of that\r\nprofession, and of its propensity to tie down the giant Truth, with its\r\nsmall threads of technicality and precedent, we perceive the danger to be\r\napprehended from the interference of such a spirit in politics, on the\r\nother side, arrayed against these petty tactics of the Forum, we see the\r\nbroad banner of Constitutional Law, upheld alike by a Fox and a Pitt, a\r\nSheridan and a Dundas, and find truth and good sense taking refuge from\r\nthe equivocations of lawyers, in such consoling documents as the Report\r\nupon the Abuses of the Trial by Burke--a document which, if ever a reform\r\nof the English law should be attempted, will stand as a great guiding\r\nlight to the adventurers in that heroic enterprise.\r\n\r\nIt has been frequently asserted, that on the evening of Mr. Sheridan's\r\ngrand display in the House of Commons, The School for Scandal and the\r\nDuenna were acted at Covent Garden and Drury Lane, and thus three great\r\naudiences were at the same moment amused, agitated, and, as it were,\r\nwielded by the intellect of one man. As this triple triumph of\r\ntalent--this manifestation of the power of Genius to multiply itself,\r\nlike an Indian god--was, in the instance of Sheridan, not only possible,\r\nbut within the scope of a very easy arrangement, it is to be lamented\r\nthat no such coincidence did actually take place, and that the ability to\r\nhave achieved the miracle is all that can be with truth attributed to\r\nhim. From a careful examination of the play-bills of the different\r\ntheatres during this period, I have ascertained, with regret, that\r\nneither on the evening of the speech in the House of Commons, nor on any\r\nof the days of the oration in Westminster Hall, was there, either at\r\nCovent-Garden, Drury-Lane, or Haymarket theatres, any piece whatever of\r\nMr. Sheridan's acted.\r\n\r\nThe following passages of a letter from Miss Sheridan to her sister in\r\nIreland, written while on a visit with her brother in London, though\r\nreferring to a later period of the Trial, may without impropriety be\r\ninserted here:--\r\n\r\n\"Just as I received your letter yesterday, I was setting out for the\r\nTrial with Mrs. Crewe and Mrs. Dixon. I was fortunate in my day, as I\r\nheard all the principal speakers--Mr. Burke I admired the least--Mr. Fox\r\nvery much indeed. The subject in itself was not particularly interesting,\r\nas the debate turned merely on a point of law, but the earnestness of his\r\nmanner and the amazing precision with which he conveys his ideas is truly\r\ndelightful. And last, not least, I heard my brother! I cannot express to\r\nyou the sensation of pleasure and pride that filled my heart at the\r\nmoment he rose. Had I never seen him or heard his name before, I should\r\nhave conceived him the first man among them at once. There is a dignity\r\nand grace in his countenance and deportment, very striking--at the same\r\ntime that one cannot trace the smallest degree of conscious superiority\r\nin his manner. His voice, too, appeared to me extremely fine. The speech\r\nitself was not much calculated to display the talents of an orator, as of\r\ncourse it related only to dry matter. You may suppose I am not so lavish\r\nof praises before indifferent persons, but I am sure you will acquit me\r\nof partiality in what I have said. When they left the Hall we walked\r\nabout some time, and were joined by several of the managers--among the\r\nrest by Mr. Burke, whom we set down at his own house. They seem now to\r\nhave better hopes of the business than they have had for some time; as\r\nthe point urged with so much force and apparent success relates to very\r\nmaterial evidence which the Lords have refused to hear, but which, once\r\nproduced, must prove strongly against Mr. Hastings; and, from what passed\r\nyesterday, they think their Lordships must yield.--We sat in the King's\r\nbox,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF MR. SHERIDAN'S FATHER.--VERSES BY MRS. SHERIDAN ON THE DEATH OF\r\nHER SISTER, MRS. TICKELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of this year the father of Mr. Sheridan died. He had been\r\nrecommended to try the air of Lisbon for his health, and had left Dublin\r\nfor that purpose, accompanied by his younger daughter. But the rapid\r\nincrease of his malady prevented him from proceeding farther than\r\nMargate, where he died about the beginning of August, attended in his\r\nlast moments by his son Richard.\r\n\r\nWe have seen with what harshness, to use no stronger term, Mr. Sheridan\r\nwas for many years treated by his father, and how persevering and\r\naffectionate were the efforts, in spite of many capricious repulses, that\r\nhe made to be restored to forgiveness and favor. In his happiest moments,\r\nboth of love and fame, the thought of being excluded from the paternal\r\nroof came across him with a chill that seemed to sadden all his triumph.\r\n[Footnote: See the letter written by him immediately after his marriage,\r\nvol. i. page 80, and the anecdote in page 111, same vol.] When it is\r\nconsidered, too, that the father, to whom he felt thus amiably, had never\r\ndistinguished him by any particular kindness but, on the contrary, had\r\nalways shown a marked preference for the disposition and abilities of his\r\nbrother Charles--it is impossible not to acknowledge, in such true filial\r\naffection, a proof that talent was not the only ornament of Sheridan, and\r\nthat, however unfavorable to moral culture was the life that he led,\r\nNature, in forming his mind, had implanted there virtue, as well as\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nOf the tender attention which he paid to his father on his death-bed, I\r\nam enabled to lay before the reader no less a testimony than the letters\r\nwritten at the time by Miss Sheridan, who, as I have already said,\r\naccompanied the old gentleman from Ireland, and now shared with her\r\nbrother the task of comforting his last moments. And here,--it is\r\ndifficult even for contempt to keep down the indignation, that one cannot\r\nbut feel at those slanderers, under the name of biographers, who calling\r\nin malice to the aid of their ignorance, have not scrupled to assert that\r\nthe father of Sheridan died unattended by any of his nearest\r\nrelatives!--Such are ever the marks that Dulness leaves behind, in its\r\nGothic irruptions into the sanctuary of departed Genius--defacing what it\r\ncannot understand, polluting what it has not the soul to reverence, and\r\ntaking revenge for its own darkness, by the wanton profanation of all\r\nthat is sacred in the eyes of others.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the death of their father, Sheridan removed his sister to\r\nDeepden--a seat of the Duke of Norfolk in Surrey, which His Grace had\r\nlately lent him--and then returned, himself, to Margate, to pay the last\r\ntribute to his father's remains. The letters of Miss Sheridan are\r\naddressed to her elder sister in Ireland, and the first which I shall\r\ngive entire, was written a day or two after her arrival at Deepden.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR LOVE,\r\n\r\n\"_Dibden, August 18._\r\n\r\n\"Though you have ever been uppermost in my thoughts, yet it has not been\r\nin my power to write since the few lines I sent from Margate. I hope this\r\nwill find you, in some degree, recovered from the shock you must have\r\nexperienced from the late melancholy event. I trust to your own piety and\r\nthe tenderness of your worthy husband, for procuring you such a degree of\r\ncalmness of mind as may secure your health from injury. In the midst of\r\nwhat I have suffered I have been thankful that you did not share a scene\r\nof distress which you could not have relieved. I have supported myself,\r\nbut I am sure, had we been together, we should have suffered more.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to my brother's kindness, I can scarcely express to you how\r\ngreat it has been. He saw my father while he was still sensible, and\r\nnever quitted him till the awful moment was past--I will not now dwell on\r\nparticulars. My mind is not sufficiently recovered to enter on the\r\nsubject, and you could only be distressed by it. He returns soon to\r\nMargate to pay the last duties in the manner desired by my father. His\r\nfeelings have been severely tried, and earnestly I pray he may not suffer\r\nfrom that cause, or from the fatigue he has endured. His tenderness to me\r\nI never can forget. I had so little claim on him, that I still feel a\r\ndegree of surprise mixed with my gratitude. Mrs. Sheridan's reception of\r\nme was truly affectionate. They leave me to myself now as much as I\r\nplease, as I had gone through so much fatigue of body and mind that I\r\nrequire some rest. I have not, as you may suppose, looked much beyond the\r\npresent hour, but I begin to be more composed. I could now enjoy your\r\nsociety, and I wish for it hourly. I should think I may hope to see you\r\nsooner in England than you had intended; but you will write to me very\r\nsoon, and let me know everything that concerns you. I know not whether\r\nyou will feel like me a melancholy pleasure in the reflection that my\r\nfather received the last kind offices from my brother Richard, [Footnote:\r\nIn a letter, from which I have given an extract in the early part of this\r\nvolume, written by the elder sister of Sheridan a short time after his\r\ndeath, in referring to the differences that existed between him and his\r\nfather, she says--\"and yet it was that son, and not the object of his\r\npartial fondness, who at last closed his eyes.\" It generally happens that\r\nthe injustice of such partialities is revenged by the ingratitude of\r\nthose who are the objects of them; and the present instance, as there is\r\nbut too much reason to believe, was not altogether an exception to the\r\nremark.] whose conduct on this occasion must convince every one of the\r\ngoodness of his heart and the truth of his filial affection. One more\r\nreflection of consolation is, that nothing was omitted that could have\r\nprolonged his life or eased his latter hours. God bless and preserve you,\r\nmy dear love. I shall soon write more to you, but shall for a short time\r\nsuspend my journal, as still too many painful thoughts will crowd upon me\r\nto suffer me to regain such a frame of mind as I should wish when I write\r\nto you.\r\n\r\n\"Ever affectionately your\r\n\r\n\"E. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter, dated a few days after, she gives an account of the\r\ndomestic life of Mrs. Sheridan, which, like everything that is related of\r\nthat most interesting woman, excites a feeling towards her memory, little\r\nshort of love.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR LOVE,\r\n\r\n\"_Dibden, Friday, 22._\r\n\r\n\"I shall endeavor to resume my journal, though my anxiety to hear from\r\nyou occupies my mind in a way that unfits me for writing. I have been\r\nhere almost a week in perfect quiet. While there was company in the\r\nhouse, I stayed in my room, and since my brother's leaving us to go to\r\nMargate, I have sat at times with Mrs. Sheridan, who is kind and\r\nconsiderate; so that I have entire liberty. Her poor sister's [Footnote:\r\nMrs. Tickell.] children are all with her. The girl gives her constant\r\nemployment, and seems to profit by being under so good an instructor.\r\nTheir father was here for some days, but I did not see him. Last night\r\nMrs. S. showed me a picture of Mrs. Tickell, which she wears round her\r\nneck. The thing was misrepresented to you;--it was not done after her\r\ndeath, but a short time before it. The sketch was taken while she slept,\r\nby a painter at Bristol. This Mrs. Sheridan got copied by Cosway, who has\r\nsoftened down the traces of illness in such a way that the picture\r\nconveys no gloomy idea. It represents her in a sweet sleep; which must\r\nhave been soothing to her friend, after seeing her for a length of time\r\nin a state of constant suffering.\r\n\r\n\"My brother left us Wednesday morning, and we do not expect him to return\r\nfor some days. He meant only to stay at Margate long enough to attend the\r\nlast melancholy office, which it was my poor father's express desire\r\nshould be performed in whatever parish he died.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_Sunday_.\r\n\r\n\"Dick is still in town, and we do not expect him for some time. Mrs.\r\nSheridan seems now quite reconciled to these little absences, which she\r\nknows are unavoidable. I never saw any one so constant in employing every\r\nmoment of her time, and to that I attribute, in a great measure, the\r\nrecovery of her health and spirits. The education of her niece, her\r\nmusic, books, and work, occupy every minute of the day. After dinner, the\r\nchildren, who call her \"Mamma-aunt,\" spend some time with us, and her\r\nmanner to them is truly delightful. The girl, you know, is the eldest.\r\nThe eldest boy is about five years old, very like his father, but\r\nextremely gentle in his manners. The youngest is past three. The whole\r\nset then retire to the music-room. As yet I cannot enjoy their\r\nparties;--a song from Mrs. Sheridan affected me last night in a most\r\npainful manner. I shall not try the experiment soon again. Mrs. S. blamed\r\nherself for putting me to the trial, and, after tea, got a book, which\r\nshe read to us till supper. This, I find, is the general way of passing\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\n\"They are now at their music, and I have retired to add a few lines. This\r\nday has been more gloomy than we have been for some days past;--it is the\r\nfirst day of our getting into mourning. All the servants in deep mourning\r\nmade a melancholy appearance, and I found it very difficult to sit out\r\nthe dinner. But as I have dined below since there has been only Mrs.\r\nSheridan and Miss Linley here, I would not suffer a circumstance, to\r\nwhich I must accustom myself, to break in on their comfort.\"\r\n\r\nThese children, to whom Mrs. Sheridan thus wholly devoted herself, and\r\ncontinued to do so for the remainder of her life, had lost their mother,\r\nMrs. Tickell, in the year 1787, by the same complaint that afterwards\r\nproved fatal to their aunt. The passionate attachment of Mrs. Sheridan to\r\nthis sister, and the deep grief with which she mourned her loss, are\r\nexpressed in a poem of her own so touchingly, that, to those who love the\r\nlanguage of real feeling, I need not apologize for their introduction\r\nhere. Poetry, in general, is but a cold interpreter of sorrow; and the\r\nmore it displays its skill, as an art, the less is it likely to do\r\njustice to nature. In writing these verses, however, the workmanship was\r\nforgotten in the subject; and the critic, to feel them as he ought,\r\nshould forget his own craft in reading them.\r\n\r\n\"_Written in the Spring of the Year 1788._\r\n\r\n \"The hours and days pass on;--sweet Spring returns,\r\n  And whispers comfort to the heart that mourns:\r\n  But not to mine, whose dear and cherish'd grief\r\n  Asks for indulgence, but ne'er hopes relief.\r\n  For, ah, can changing seasons e'er restore\r\n  The lov'd companion I must still deplore?\r\n  Shall all the wisdom of the world combin'd\r\n  Erase thy image, Mary, from my mind,\r\n  Or bid me hope from others to receive\r\n  The fond affection thou alone could'st give?\r\n  Ah, no, my best belov'd, thou still shalt be\r\n  My friend, my sister, all the world to me.\r\n\r\n  \"With tender woe sad memory woos back time,\r\n  And paints the scenes when youth was in its prime;\r\n  The craggy hill, where rocks, with wild flow'rs crown'd,\r\n  Burst from the hazle copse or verdant ground;\r\n  Where sportive nature every form assumes,\r\n  And, gaily lavish, wastes a thousand blooms;\r\n  Where oft we heard the echoing hills repeat\r\n  Our untaught strains and rural ditties sweet,\r\n  Till purpling clouds proclaimed the closing day,\r\n  While distant streams detain'd the parting ray.\r\n  Then on some mossy stone we'd sit us down,\r\n  And watch the changing sky and shadows brown,\r\n  That swiftly glided o'er the mead below,\r\n  Or in some fancied form descended slow.\r\n  How oft, well pleas'd each other to adorn,\r\n  We stripped the blossoms from the fragrant thorn,\r\n  Or caught the violet where, in humble bed,\r\n  Asham'd its own sweets it hung its head.\r\n  But, oh, what rapture Mary's eyes would speak,\r\n  Through her dark hair how rosy glow'd her cheek,\r\n  If, in her playful search, she saw appear\r\n  The first-blown cowslip of the opening year.\r\n  Thy gales, oh Spring, then whisper'd life and joy;--\r\n  Now mem'ry wakes thy pleasures to destroy,\r\n  And all thy beauties serve but to renew\r\n  Regrets too keen for reason to subdue.\r\n  Ah me! while tender recollections rise,\r\n  The ready tears obscure my sadden'd eyes,\r\n  And, while surrounding objects they conceal,\r\n  _Her_ form belov'd the trembling drops reveal.\r\n\r\n  \"Sometimes the lovely, blooming girl I view.\r\n  My youth's companion, friend for ever true,\r\n  Whose looks, the sweet expressions of her heart\r\n  So gaily innocent, so void of art,\r\n  With soft attraction whisper'd blessings drew\r\n  From all who stopp'd, her beauteous face to view.\r\n  Then in the dear domestic scene I mourn,\r\n  And weep past pleasures never to return!\r\n  There, where each gentle virtue lov'd to rest.\r\n  In the pure mansion of my Mary's breast,\r\n  The days of social happiness are o'er,\r\n  The voice of harmony is heard no more;\r\n  No more her graceful tenderness shall prove\r\n  The wife's fond duty or the parent's love.\r\n  Those eyes, which brighten'd with maternal pride,\r\n  As her sweet infants wanton'd by her side,\r\n  'Twas my sad fate to see for ever close\r\n  On life, on love, the world, and all its woes;\r\n  To watch the slow disease, with hopeless care,\r\n  And veil in painful smiles my heart's despair;\r\n  To see her droop, with restless languor weak,\r\n  While fatal beauty mantled in her cheek,\r\n  Like fresh flow'rs springing from some mouldering clay,\r\n  Cherish'd by death, and blooming from decay.\r\n  Yet, tho' oppress'd by ever-varying pain,\r\n  The gentle sufferer scarcely would complain,\r\n  Hid every sigh, each trembling doubt reprov'd,\r\n  To spare a pang to those fond hearts she lov'd.\r\n  And often, in short intervals of ease,\r\n  Her kind and cheerful spirit strove to please;\r\n  Whilst we, alas, unable to refuse\r\n  The sad delight we were so soon to lose,\r\n  Treasur'd each word, each kind expression claim'd,--\r\n  ''Twas me she look'd at,'--'it was me she nam'd.'\r\n  Thus fondly soothing grief, too great to bear,\r\n  With mournful eagerness and jealous care.\r\n\r\n  \"But soon, alas, from hearts with sorrow worn\r\n  E'en this last comfort was for ever torn:\r\n  That mind, the seat of wisdom, genius, taste.\r\n  The cruel hand of sickness now laid waste;\r\n  Subdued with pain, it shar'd the common lot.\r\n  All, all its lovely energies forgot!\r\n  The husband, parent, sister, knelt in vain,\r\n  One recollecting look alone to gain:\r\n  The shades of night her beaming eyes obscur'd,\r\n  And Nature, vanquished, no sharp pain endur'd;\r\n  Calm and serene--till the last trembling breath\r\n  Wafted an angel from the bed of death!\r\n\r\n  \"Oh, if the soul, releas'd from mortal cares,\r\n  Views the sad scene, the voice of mourning hears,\r\n  Then, dearest saint, didst thou thy heav'n forego,\r\n  Lingering on earth in pity to our woe.\r\n  'Twas thy kind influence sooth'd our minds to peace.\r\n  And bade our vain and selfish murmurs cease;\r\n  'Twas thy soft smile, that gave the worshipp'd clay\r\n  Of thy bright essence one celestial ray,\r\n  Making e'en death so beautiful, that we,\r\n  Gazing on it, forgot our misery.\r\n  Then--pleasing thought!--ere to the realms of light\r\n  Thy franchis'd spirit took its happy flight,\r\n  With fond regard, perhaps, thou saw'st me bend\r\n  O'er the cold relics of my heart's best friend,\r\n  And heard'st me swear, while her dear hand I prest.\r\n  And tears of agony bedew'd my breast,\r\n  For her lov'd sake to act the mother's part,\r\n  And take her darling infants to my heart,\r\n  With tenderest care their youthful minds improve,\r\n  And guard her treasure with protecting love.\r\n  Once more look down, blest creature, and behold\r\n  These arms the precious innocence enfold;\r\n  Assist my erring nature to fulfil\r\n  The sacred trust, and ward off every ill!\r\n  And, oh, let _her_, who is my dearest care,\r\n  Thy blest regard and heavenly influence share;\r\n  Teach me to form her pure and artless mind,\r\n  Like thine, as true, as innocent, as kind,--\r\n  That when some future day my hopes shall bless,\r\n  And every voice her virtue shall confess,\r\n  When my fond heart delighted hears her praise,\r\n  As with unconscious loveliness she strays,\r\n  'Such,' let me say, with tears of joy the while,\r\n  'Such was the softness of my Mary's smile;\r\n  Such was _her_ youth, so blithe, so rosy sweet,\r\n  And such _her_ mind, unpractis'd in deceit;\r\n  With artless elegance, unstudied grace,\r\n  Thus did _she_ gain in every heart a place!'\r\n\r\n  \"Then, while the dear remembrance I behold,\r\n  Time shall steal on, nor tell me I am old,\r\n  Till, nature wearied, each fond duty o'er,\r\n  I join my Angel Friend--to part no more!\"\r\n\r\nTo the conduct of Mr. Sheridan, during the last moments of his father, a\r\nfurther testimony has been kindly communicated to me by Mr. Jarvis, a\r\nmedical gentleman of Margate, who attended Mr. Thomas Sheridan on that\r\noccasion, and whose interesting communication I shall here give in his\r\nown words:--\r\n\r\n\"On the 10th of August, 1788, I was first called on to visit Mr.\r\nSheridan, who was then fast declining at his lodgings in this place,\r\nwhere he was in the care of his daughter. On the next day Mr. R. B.\r\nSheridan arrived here from town, having brought with him Dr. Morris, of\r\nParliament street. I was in the bedroom with Mr. Sheridan when the son\r\narrived, and witnessed an interview in which the father showed himself to\r\nbe strongly impressed by his son's attention, saying with considerable\r\nemotion, 'Oh Dick, I give you a great deal of trouble!' and seeming to\r\nimply by his manner, that his son had been less to blame than himself,\r\nfor any previous want of cordiality between them.\r\n\r\n\"On my making my last call for the evening, Mr. R. B. Sheridan, with\r\ndelicacy, but much earnestness, expressed his fear that the nurse in\r\nattendance on his father, might not be so competent as myself to the\r\nrequisite attentions, and his hope that I would consent to remain in the\r\nroom for a few of the first hours of the night; as he himself, having\r\nbeen travelling the preceding night, required some short repose. I\r\ncomplied with his request, and remained at the father's bed-side till\r\nrelieved by the son, about three o'clock in the morning:--he then\r\ninsisted on taking my place. From this time he never quitted the house\r\ntill his father's death; on the day after which he wrote me a letter, now\r\nbefore me, of which the annexed is an exact copy:\r\n\r\n'SIR,\r\n\r\n'_Friday Morning_,\r\n\r\n'I wished to see you this morning before I went, to thank you for your\r\nattention and trouble. You will be so good to give the account to Mr.\r\nThompson, who will settle it; and I must further beg your acceptance of\r\nthe inclosed from myself.\r\n\r\n'I am, Sir,\r\n\r\n'Your obedient Servant,\r\n\r\n'R. B. SHERIDAN.\r\n\r\n'I have explained to Dr. Morris (who has informed me that you will\r\nrecommend a proper person), that it is my desire to have the hearse, and\r\nthe manner of coming to town, as respectful as possible.'\r\n\r\n\"The inclosure, referred to in this letter, was a bank-note of ten\r\npounds,--a most liberal remuneration. Mr. R. B. Sheridan left Margate,\r\nintending that his father should be buried in London; but he there\r\nascertained that it had been his father's expressed wish that he should\r\nbe buried in the parish next to that in which he should happen to die. He\r\nthen, consequently, returned to Margate, accompanied by his\r\nbrother-in-law, Mr. Tickell, with whom and Mr. Thompson and myself, he\r\nfollowed his father's remains to the burial-place, which was not in\r\nMargate church-yard, but in the north aisle of the church of St. Peter's.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jarvis, the writer of the letter from which I have given this\r\nextract, had once, as he informs me, the intention of having a cenotaph\r\nraised, to the memory of Mr. Sheridan's father, in the church of Margate.\r\n[Footnote: Though this idea was relinquished, it appears that a friend of\r\nMr. Jarvis, with a zeal for the memory of talent highly honorable to him,\r\nhas recently caused a monument to Mr. Thomas Sheridan to be raised in the\r\nchurch of St. Peter.] With this view he applied to Dr. Parr for an\r\nInscription, and the following is the tribute to his old friend with\r\nwhich that learned and kind-hearted man supplied him:--\r\n\r\n\"This monument, A. D. 1824, was, by subscription, erected to the memory\r\nof Thomas Sheridan, Esq., who died in the neighboring parish of St. John,\r\nAugust 14, 1788, in the 69th year of his age, and, according to his own\r\nrequest, was there buried. He was grandson to Dr. Thomas Sheridan, the\r\nbrother of Dr. William, a conscientious non-juror, who, in 1691, was\r\ndeprived of the Bishopric of Kilmore. He was the son of Dr. Thomas\r\nSheridan, a profound scholar and eminent schoolmaster, intimately\r\nconnected with Dean Swift and other illustrious writers in the reign of\r\nQueen Anne. He was husband to the ingenious and amiable author of Sidney\r\nBiddulph and several dramatic pieces favorably received. He was father of\r\nthe celebrated orator and dramatist, Richard Brinsley Sheridan. He had\r\nbeen the schoolfellow, and, through life, was the companion, of the\r\namiable Archbishop Markham. He was the friend of the learned Dr. Sumner,\r\nmaster of Harrow School, and the well-known Dr. Parr. He took his first\r\nacademical degree in the University of Dublin, about 1736. He was honored\r\nby the University of Oxford with the degree of A. M. in 1758, and in 1759\r\nhe obtained the same distinction at Cambridge. He, for many years,\r\npresided over the theatre of Dublin; and, at Drury Lane, he in public\r\nestimation stood next to David Garrick. In the literary world he was\r\ndistinguished by numerous and useful writings on the pronunciation of the\r\nEnglish language. Through some of his opinions ran a vein of singularity,\r\nmingled with the rich ore of genius. In his manners there was dignified\r\nease;--in his spirit, invincible firmness;--and in his habits and\r\nprinciples, unsullied integrity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nILLNESS OF THE KING.--REGENCY.--PRIVATE LIFE OF MR. SHERIDAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Sheridan had assuredly no reason to complain of any deficiency of\r\nexcitement in the new career to which he now devoted himself. A\r\nsuccession of great questions, both foreign and domestic, came, one after\r\nthe other, like the waves described by the poet;--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"And one no sooner touched the shore, and died,\r\n  Than a new follower rose, and swell'd as proudly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely had the impulse, which his own genius had given to the\r\nprosecution of Hastings, begun to abate, when the indisposition of the\r\nKing opened another field, not only for the display of all his various\r\npowers, but for the fondest speculations of his interest and ambition.\r\n\r\nThe robust health and temperate habits of the Monarch, while they held\r\nout the temptation of a long lease of power, to those who either enjoyed\r\nor were inclined to speculate in his favor, gave proportionally the grace\r\nof disinterestedness to the followers of an Heir-Apparent, whose means of\r\nrewarding their devotion were, from the same causes, uncertain and\r\nremote. The alarming illness of the Monarch, however, gave a new turn to\r\nthe prospect:--Hope was now seen, like the winged Victory of the\r\nancients, to change sides; and both the expectations of those who looked\r\nforward to the reign of the Prince, as the great and happy millennium of\r\nWhiggism, and the apprehensions of the far greater number, to whom the\r\nmorals of his Royal Highness and his friends were not less formidable\r\nthan their politics, seemed now on the very eve of being realized.\r\n\r\nOn the first meeting of Parliament, after the illness of His Majesty was\r\nknown, it was resolved, from considerations of delicacy, that the House\r\nshould adjourn for a fortnight; at the end of which period it was\r\nexpected that another short adjournment would be proposed by the\r\nMinister. In this interval, the following judicious letter was addressed\r\nto the Prince of Wales by Mr. Sheridan:--\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"Prom the intelligence of to-day we are led to think that Pitt will make\r\nsomething more of a speech, in moving to adjourn on Thursday, than was at\r\nfirst imagined. In this case we presume Your Royal Highness will be of\r\nopinion that we must not be wholly silent. I possessed Payne yesterday\r\nwith my sentiments on the line of conduct which appeared to me best to be\r\nadopted on this occasion, that they might be submitted to Your Royal\r\nHighness's consideration; and I take the liberty of repeating my firm\r\nconviction, that it will greatly advance Your Royal Highness's credit,\r\nand, in case of events, lay the strongest grounds to baffle every attempt\r\nat opposition to Your Royal Highness's just claims and right, that the\r\nlanguage of those who may be, in any sort, suspected of knowing Your\r\nRoyal Highness's wishes and feelings, should be that of great moderation\r\nin disclaiming all party views, and avowing the utmost readiness to\r\nacquiesce in any reasonable delay. At the same time, I am perfectly aware\r\nof the arts which will be practised, and the advantages which some people\r\nwill attempt to gain by time: but I am equally convinced that we should\r\nadvance their evil views by showing the least impatience or suspicion at\r\npresent; and I am also convinced that a third party will soon appear,\r\nwhose efforts may, in the most decisive manner, prevent this sort of\r\nsituation and proceeding from continuing long. Payne will probably have\r\nsubmitted to Your Royal Highness more fully my idea on this subject,\r\ntowards which I have already taken some successful steps. [Footnote: This\r\nmust allude to the negotiation with Lord Thurlow.] Your Royal Highness\r\nwill, I am sure, have the goodness to pardon the freedom with which I\r\ngive my opinion;--after which I have only to add, that whatever Your\r\nRoyal Highness's judgment decides, shall be the guide of my conduct, and\r\nwill undoubtedly be so to others.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain (afterwards Admiral) Payne, of whom mention is made in this\r\nletter, held the situation of Comptroller of the Household of the Prince\r\nof Wales, and was in attendance upon His Royal Highness, during the early\r\npart of the King's illness, at Windsor. The following letters, addressed\r\nby him to Mr. Sheridan at this period, contain some curious particulars,\r\nboth with respect to the Royal patient himself, and the feelings of those\r\nabout him, which, however secret and confidential they were at the time,\r\nmay now, without scruple, be made matters of history:--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SHERIDAN,\r\n\r\n\"_Half past ten at night_.\r\n\r\n\"I arrived here about three quarters of an hour after Pitt had left it. I\r\ninclose you the copy of a letter the Prince has just written to the\r\nChancellor, and sent by express, which will give you the outline of the\r\nconversation with the Prince, as well as the situation of the King's\r\nhealth. I think it an advisable measure, [Footnote: Meaning, the\r\ncommunication to the Chancellor] as it is a sword that cuts both ways,\r\nwithout being unfit to be shown to whom he pleases,--but which he will, I\r\nthink, understand best himself. Pitt desired the longest delay that could\r\nbe granted with propriety, previous to the declaration of the present\r\ncalamity. The Duke of York, who is looking over me, and is just come out\r\nof the King's room, bids me add that His Majesty's situation is every\r\nmoment becoming worse. His pulse is weaker and weaker; and the Doctors\r\nsay it is impossible to survive it long, if his situation does not take\r\nsome _extraordinary_ change in a few hours.\r\n\r\n\"So far I had got when your servant came, meaning to send this by the\r\nexpress that carried the Chancellor's letter; in addition to which, the\r\nPrince has desired Doctor Warren to write an account to him, which he is\r\nnow doing. His letter says, if an amendment does not take place in\r\ntwenty-four hours, it is impossible for the King to support it:--he adds\r\nto me, he will answer for his never living to be declared a lunatic. I\r\nsay all this to you in confidence, (though I will not answer for being\r\nintelligible,) as it goes by your own servant; but I need not add, your\r\nown discretion will remind you how necessary it is that neither my name\r\nnor those I use should be quoted even to many of our best friends, whose\r\nrepetition, without any ill intention, might frustrate views they do not\r\nsee.\r\n\r\n\"With respect to the papers, the Prince thinks you had better leave them\r\nto themselves, as we cannot authorize any report, nor can he contradict\r\nthe worst; a few hours must, every individual says, terminate our\r\nsuspense, and, therefore, all precaution must be needless:--however, do\r\nwhat you think best. His Royal Highness would write to you himself; the\r\nagitation he is in will not permit it. Since this letter was begun, all\r\narticulation even seems to be at an end with the poor King: but for the\r\ntwo hours preceding, he was in a most determined frenzy. In short, I am\r\nmyself in so violent a state of agitation, from participating in the\r\nfeelings of those about me, that if I am intelligible to you, 'tis more\r\nthan I am to myself. Cataplasms are on his Majesty's feet, and strong\r\nfomentations have been used without effect: but let me quit so painful a\r\nsubject. The Prince was much pleased with my conversation with Lord\r\nLoughborough, to whom I do not write, as I conceive 'tis the same,\r\nwriting to you.\r\n\r\n\"The Archbishop has written a very handsome letter, expressive of his\r\nduty and offer of service; but he is not required to come down, it being\r\nthought too late.\r\n\r\n\"Good night.--I will write upon every occasion that information may be\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\n\"Ever yours, most sincerely,\r\n\r\n\"J. W. PAYNE.\r\n\r\n\"I have been much pleased with the _Duke's_ zeal since my return,\r\nespecially in this communication to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SHERIDAN,\r\n\r\n\"_Twelve o'clock, noon._\r\n\r\n\"The King last night about twelve o'clock, being then in a situation he\r\ncould not long have survived, by the effect of James's powder, had a\r\nprofuse stool, after which a strong perspiration appeared, and he fell\r\ninto a profound sleep. We were in hopes this was the crisis of his\r\ndisorder, although the doctors were fearful it was so only with respect\r\nto one part of his disorder. However, these hopes continued not above an\r\nhour, when he awoke, with a well-conditioned skin, no extraordinary\r\ndegree of fever, but with the exact state he was in before, with all the\r\ngestures and ravings of the most confirmed maniac, and a new noise, in\r\nimitation of the howling of a dog; in this situation he was this morning\r\nat one o'clock, when we came to bed. The Duke of York, who has been twice\r\nin my room in the course of the night, immediately from the King's\r\napartment, says there has not been one moment of lucid interval during\r\nthe whole night,--which, I must observe to you, is the concurring, as\r\nwell as _fatal_ testimony of all about him, from the first moment of\r\nHis Majesty's confinement. The doctors have since had their consultation,\r\nand find His Majesty calmer, and his pulse tolerably good and much\r\nreduced, but the most decided symptoms of insanity. His theme has been\r\nall this day on the subject of religion, and of his being inspired, from\r\nwhich his physicians draw the worst consequences, as to any hopes of\r\namendment. In this situation His Majesty remains at the present moment,\r\nwhich I give you at length, to prevent your giving credit to the thousand\r\nridiculous reports that we hear, even upon the spot. Truth is not easily\r\ngot at in palaces, and so I find here; and time only slowly brings it to\r\none's knowledge. One hears a little bit every day from somebody, that has\r\nbeen reserved with great costiveness, or purposely forgotten; and by all\r\nsuch accounts I find that the present distemper has been very palpable\r\nfor some time past, previous to any confinement from sickness; and so\r\napprehensive have the people about him been of giving offence by\r\ninterruption, that the two days (viz. yesterday se'nnight and the Monday\r\nfollowing) that he was five hours each on horseback, he was in a\r\nconfirmed frenzy. On the Monday at his return he burst out into tears to\r\nthe Duke of York, and said, 'He wished to God he might die, I for he was\r\ngoing to be mad;' and the Queen, who sent to Dr. Warren, on his arrival,\r\nprivately communicated her knowledge of his situation for some time past,\r\nand the melancholy event as it stood exposed. I am prolix upon all these\r\ndifferent reports, that you may be completely master of the subject as it\r\nstands, and which I shall continue to advertise you of in all its\r\nvariations. Warren, who is the living principle in this business, (for\r\npoor Baker is half crazed himself,) and who I see every half hour, is\r\nextremely attentive to the King's disorder. The various fluctuations of\r\nhis ravings, as well as general situation of his health, are accurately\r\nwritten down throughout the day, and this we have got signed by the\r\nPhysician every day, and all proper inquiry invited; for I think it\r\nnecessary to do every thing that may prevent their making use hereafter\r\nof any thing like jealousy, suspicion, or mystery, to create public\r\ndistrust; and, therefore, the best and most unequivocal means of\r\nsatisfaction shall be always attended to.\r\n\r\n\"_Five o'clock, P.M._\r\n\r\n\"So far I had proceeded when I was, on some business of importance,\r\nobliged to break off till now; and, on my return, found your letter;--I\r\nneed not, I hope, say your confidence is as safe as if it was returned to\r\nyour own mind, and your advice will always be thankfully adopted. The\r\nevent we looked for last night is postponed, perhaps for a short time, so\r\nthat, at least, we shall have time to consider more maturely. The Doctors\r\ntold Pitt they would beg not to be obliged to make their declaration for\r\na fortnight as to the incurability of the King's mind, and not to be\r\nsurprised if, at the expiration of that time, they should ask more time;\r\nbut that they were perfectly ready to declare now for the furtherance of\r\npublic business, that he is now insane; that it appears to be unconnected\r\nwith any other disease of his body, and that they have tried all their\r\nskill without effect, and that to the _disease they at present see no\r\nend in their contemplation:_--these are their own words, which is all\r\nthat can be implied in an absolute declaration,--for infallibility cannot\r\nbe ascribed to them.\r\n\r\n\"Should not something be done about the public amusements? If it was\r\nrepresented to Pitt, it might embarrass them either way; particularly as\r\nit might call for a public account every day. I think the Chancellor\r\nmight take a good opportunity to break with his colleagues, if they\r\npropose restriction, the Law authority would have great weight with us,\r\nas well as preventing even a design of moving the City;--at all events, I\r\nthink Parliament would not confirm their opinion. If Pitt stirs much, I\r\nthink any attempt to _grasp at power_ might be fatal to his\r\ninterest, at least, well turned against it.\r\n\r\n\"The Prince has sent for me directly, so I'll send this now, and write\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nIn the words, \"I think the Chancellor might take a good opportunity to\r\nbreak with his colleagues,\" the writer alludes to a negotiation which\r\nSheridan had entered into with Lord Thurlow, and by which it was expected\r\nthat the co-operation of that Learned Lord might be secured, in\r\nconsideration of his being allowed to retain the office of Chancellor\r\nunder the Regency.\r\n\r\nLord Thurlow was one of those persons who, being taken by the world at\r\ntheir own estimate of themselves, contrive to pass upon the times in\r\nwhich they live for much more than they are worth. His bluntness gained\r\nhim credit for superior honesty, and the same peculiarity of exterior\r\ngave a weight, not their own, to his talents; the roughness of the\r\ndiamond being, by a very common mistake, made the measure of its value.\r\nThe negotiation for his alliance on this occasion was managed, if not\r\nfirst suggested, by Sheridan; and Mr. Fox, on his arrival from the\r\nContinent, (having been sent for express upon the first announcement of\r\nthe King's illness,) found considerable progress already made in the\r\npreliminaries of this heterogeneous compact.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Admiral Payne, written immediately after the\r\nreturn of Mr. Fox, contains some further allusions to the negotiations\r\nwith the Chancellor:--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SHERIDAN,\r\n\r\n\"I am this moment returned with the Prince from riding, and heard, with\r\ngreat pleasure, of Charles Fox's arrival; on which account, he says, I\r\nmust go to town to-morrow, when I hope to meet you at his house some time\r\nbefore dinner. The Prince is to see the Chancellor to-morrow, and\r\ntherefore he wishes I should be able to carry to town the result of this\r\ninterview, or I would set off immediately. Due deference is had to our\r\n_former opinion_ upon this subject, and no courtship will be\r\npractised; for the chief object in the visit is to show him the King, who\r\nhas been worse the two last days than ever: this morning he made an\r\neffort to jump out of the window, and is now very turbulent and\r\nincoherent. Sir G. Baker went yesterday to give Pitt a little specimen of\r\nhis loquacity, in his discovery of some material state-secrets, at which\r\nhe looked astonished. The Physicians wish him to be removed to Kew; on\r\nwhich we shall proceed as we settled. Have you heard any thing of the\r\nForeign Ministers respecting what the P. said at Bagshot? The Frenchman\r\nhas been here two days running, but has not seen the Prince. He sat with\r\nme half an hour this morning, and seemed much disposed to confer a little\r\nclosely. He was all admiration and friendship for the Prince, and said he\r\nwas sure _every body_ would unite to give vigor to his government.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow you shall hear particulars; in the mean time I can only add I\r\nhave none of the apprehensions contained in Lord L.'s letter. I have had\r\ncorrespondence enough myself on this subject to convince me of the\r\nimpossibility of the Ministry managing the present Parliament by any\r\ncontrivance hostile to the Prince. Dinner is on table; so adieu; and be\r\nassured of the truth and sincerity of\r\n\r\n\"Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n\"_Windsor, Monday, 5 o'clock, P. M._\r\n\r\n\"J. W. P.\r\n\r\n\"I have just got Rodney's proxy sent.\"\r\n\r\nThe situation in which Mr. Fox was placed by the treaty thus commenced,\r\nbefore his arrival, with the Chancellor, was not a little embarrassing.\r\nIn addition to the distaste which he must have felt for such a union, he\r\nhad been already, it appears, in some degree pledged to bestow the Great\r\nSeal, in the event of a change, upon Lord Loughborough. Finding, however,\r\nthe Prince and his party so far committed in the negotiation with Lord\r\nThurlow, he thought it expedient, however contrary to his own wishes, to\r\naccede to their views; and a letter, addressed by him to Mr. Sheridan on\r\nthe occasion, shows the struggle with his own feelings and opinions,\r\nwhich this concession cost him:--\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SHERIDAN,\r\n\r\n\"I have swallowed the pill,--a most bitter one it was,--and have written\r\nto Lord Loughborough, whose answer of course must be consent. What is to\r\nbe done next? Should the Prince himself, you, or I, or Warren, be the\r\nperson to speak to the Chancellor? The objection to the last is, that he\r\nmust probably wait for an opportunity, and that no time is to be lost.\r\nPray tell me what is to be done: I am convinced, after all, the\r\nnegotiation will not succeed, and am not sure that I am sorry for it. I\r\ndo not remember ever feeling so uneasy about any political thing I ever\r\ndid in my life. Call if you can.\r\n\r\n\"Yours ever,\r\n\r\n\"C. J. F.\"\r\n\r\n_Sat. past 12._\r\n\r\nLord Loughborough, in the mean time, with a vigilance quickened by his\r\nown personal views, kept watch on the mysterious movements of the\r\nChancellor; and, as appears by the following letter, not only saw reason\r\nto suspect duplicity himself, but took care that Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan\r\nshould share in his distrust:--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR S.\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid to pursue the conversation on the circumstance of the\r\nInspection committed to the Chancellor, lest the reflections that arise\r\nupon it might have made too strong an impression on some of our neighbors\r\nlast night. It does indeed appear to me full of mischief, and of that\r\nsort most likely to affect the apprehensions of our best friends, (of\r\nLord John for instance,) and to increase their reluctance to take any\r\nactive part.\r\n\r\n\"The Chancellor's object evidently is to make his way by himself, and he\r\nhas managed hitherto as one very well practised in that game. His\r\nconversations, both with you and Mr. Fox, were encouraging, but at the\r\nsame time checked all explanations on his part under a pretence of\r\ndelicacy towards his colleagues. When he let them go to Salthill and\r\ncontrived to dine at Windsor, he certainly took a step that most men\r\nwould have felt not very delicate in its appearance, and unless there was\r\nsome private understanding between him and them, not altogether fair;\r\nespecially if you add to it the sort of conversation he held with regard\r\nto them. I cannot help thinking that the difficulties of managing the\r\npatient have been excited or improved to lead to the proposal of his\r\ninspection, (without the Prince being conscious of it,) for by that\r\nsituation he gains an easy and frequent access to him, and an opportunity\r\nof possessing the confidence of the Queen. I believe this the more from\r\nthe account of the tenderness he showed at his first interview, for I am\r\nsure, it is not in his character to feel any. With a little instruction\r\nfrom Lord Hawksbury, the sort of management that was carried on by means\r\nof the Princess-Dowager, in the early part of the reign, may easily be\r\npractised. In short, I think he will try to find the key of the back\r\nstairs, and, with that in his pocket, take any situation that preserves\r\nhis access, and enables him to hold a line between different parties. In\r\nthe present moment, however, he has taken a position that puts the\r\ncommand of the House of Lords in his hands, for * * * * * * *. [Footnote:\r\nThe remainder of this sentence is effaced by damp]\r\n\r\n\"I wish Mr. Fox and you would give these considerations what weight you\r\nthink they deserve, and try if any means can be taken to remedy this\r\nmischief, if it appears in the same light to you.\r\n\r\n\"Ever yours, &c.\"\r\n\r\nWhat were the motives that induced Lord Thurlow to break off so suddenly\r\nhis negotiation with the Prince's party, and declare himself with such\r\nvehemence on the side of the King and Mr. Pitt, it does not appear very\r\neasy to ascertain. Possibly, from his opportunities of visiting the Royal\r\nPatient, he had been led to conceive sufficient hopes of recovery, to\r\nincline the balance of his speculation that way; or, perhaps, in the\r\ninfluence of Lord Loughborough [Footnote: Lord Loughborough is supposed\r\nto have been the person who instilled into the mind of Mr. Fox the idea\r\nof advancing that claim of right for the Prince, which gave Mr. Pitt, in\r\nprinciple as well as in fact, such an advantage over him.] over Mr. Fox,\r\nhe saw a risk of being supplanted in his views on the Great Seal.\r\nWhatever may have been the motive, it is certain that his negotiation\r\nwith the Whigs had been amicably carried on, till within a few hours of\r\nhis delivery of that speech, from whose enthusiasm the public could\r\nlittle suspect how fresh from the incomplete bargain of defection was the\r\nspeaker, and in the course of which he gave vent to the well-known\r\ndeclaration, that \"his debt of gratitude to His Majesty was ample, for\r\nthe many favors he had graciously conferred upon him, which, when he\r\nforgot, might God forget him!\" [Footnote: \"Forget you!\" said Wildes,\r\n\"he'll see you d---d first.\"]\r\n\r\nAs it is not my desire to imitate those biographers, who swell their\r\npages with details that belong more properly to History, I shall forbear\r\nto enter into a minute or consecutive narrative of the proceedings of\r\nParliament on the important subject of the Regency. A writer of political\r\nbiography has a right, no doubt, like an engineer who constructs a\r\nnavigable canal, to lay every brook and spring in the neighborhood under\r\ncontribution for the supply and enrichment of his work. But, to turn into\r\nit the whole contents of the Annual Register and Parliamentary Debates is\r\na sort of literary engineering, not quite so laudable, which, after the\r\nexample set by a Right Reverend biographer of Mr. Pitt, will hardly again\r\nbe attempted by any one, whose ambition, at least, it is to be read as\r\nwell as bought.\r\n\r\nMr. Fox and Mr. Pitt, it is well known, differed essentially, not only\r\nwith respect to the form of the proceedings, which the latter recommended\r\nin that suspension of the Royal authority, but also with respect to the\r\nabstract constitutional principles, upon which those proceedings of the\r\nMinister were professedly founded. As soon as the nature of the malady,\r\nwith which the King was afflicted, had been ascertained by a regular\r\nexamination of the physicians in attendance on His Majesty, Mr. Pitt\r\nmoved (on the 10th of December), that a \"Committee be appointed to\r\nexamine and report precedents of such proceedings as may have been had,\r\nin case of the personal exercise of the Royal authority being prevented\r\nor interrupted, by infancy, sickness, infirmity, or otherwise, with a\r\nview to provide for the same.\" [Footnote: Mr. Burke and Mr. Sheridan were\r\nboth members of this committee, and the following letter from the former\r\nto Sheridan refers to it:--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"My idea was, that on Fox's declaring that the precedents, neither\r\nindividually nor collectively, do at all apply, our attendance ought to\r\nhave been merely formal. But as you think otherwise, I shall certainly be\r\nat the committee soon after one. I rather think, that they will not\r\nattempt to garble: because, supposing the precedents to apply, the major\r\npart are certainly in their favor. It is not likely that they mean to\r\nsuppress,--but it is good to be on our guard.\r\n\r\n\"Ever most truly yours, &c.\r\n\r\n\"EDMUND BURKE.\"\r\n\r\n_Gerard Street, Thursday Morning_.]\r\n\r\nIt was immediately upon this motion that Mr. Fox advanced that\r\ninconsiderate claim of Right for the Prince of Wales, of which his rival\r\navailed himself so dexterously and triumphantly. Having asserted that\r\nthere existed no precedent whatever that could bear upon the present\r\ncase, Mr. Fox proceeded to say, that \"the circumstance to be provided for\r\ndid not depend upon their deliberations as a House of Parliament,--it\r\nrested elsewhere. There was then a person in the kingdom, different from\r\nany other person that any existing precedents could refer to,--an Heir\r\nApparent, of full age and capacity to exercise the royal power. It\r\nbehoved them, therefore, to waste not a moment unnecessarily, but to\r\nproceed with all becoming speed and diligence to restore the Sovereign\r\npower and the exercise of the Royal Authority. From what he had read of\r\nhistory, from the ideas he had formed of the law, and, what was still\r\nmore precious, of the spirit of the Constitution, from every reasoning\r\nand analogy drawn from those sources, he declared that he had not in his\r\nmind a doubt, and he should think himself culpable if he did not take the\r\nfirst opportunity of declaring it, that, in the present condition of His\r\nMajesty, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales had as clear, as express\r\na Right to exercise the power of Sovereignty, during the continuance of\r\nthe illness and incapacity, with which it had pleased God to afflict His\r\nMajesty, as in the case of His Majesty's having undergone a natural\r\ndemise.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that, during the delivery of this adventurous opinion, the\r\ncountenance of Mr. Pitt was seen to brighten with exultation at the\r\nmistake into which he perceived his adversary was hurrying; and scarcely\r\nhad the sentence, just quoted, been concluded, when, slapping his thigh\r\ntriumphantly, he turned to the person who sat next to him, and said,\r\n\"I'll _un-Whig_ the gentleman for the rest of his life!\"\r\n\r\nEven without this anecdote, which may be depended upon as authentic, we\r\nhave sufficient evidence that such were his feelings in the burst of\r\nanimation and confidence with which he instantly replied to Mr.\r\nFox,--taking his ground, with an almost equal temerity, upon the directly\r\nopposite doctrine, and asserting, not only that \"in the case of the\r\ninterruption of the personal exercise of the Royal Authority, it devolved\r\nupon the other branches of the Legislature to provide a substitute for\r\nthat authority,\" but that \"the Prince of Wales had no more right to\r\nexercise the powers of government than any other person in the realm.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the assertion of a _Right_ was equally erroneous, on\r\nboth sides of the question. The Constitution having provided no legal\r\nremedy for such an exigence as had now occurred, the two Houses of\r\nParliament had as little right (in the strict sense of the word) to\r\nsupply the deficiency of the Royal power, as the Prince had to be the\r\nperson elected or adjudged for that purpose. Constitutional analogy and\r\nexpediency were the only authorities by which the measures necessary in\r\nsuch a conjuncture could be either guided or sanctioned; and if the\r\ndisputants on each side had softened down their tone to this true and\r\npractical view of the case, there would have been no material difference,\r\nin the first stage of the proceedings between them,--Mr. Pitt being\r\nready to allow that the Heir Apparent was the obvious person to whom\r\nexpediency pointed as the depository of the Royal power, and Mr. Fox\r\nhaving granted, in a subsequent explanation of his doctrine, that, strong\r\nas was the right upon which the claim of the Prince was founded, His\r\nRoyal Highness could not assume that right till it had been formally\r\nadjudicated to him by Parliament. The principle, however, having been\r\nimprudently broached, Mr. Pitt was too expert a tactician not to avail\r\nhimself of the advantage it gave him. He was thus, indeed, furnished with\r\nan opportunity, not only of gaining time by an artful protraction of the\r\ndiscussions, but of occupying victoriously the ground of Whiggism, which\r\nMr. Fox had, in his impatience or precipitancy, deserted, and of thus\r\nadding to the character, which he had recently acquired, of a defender of\r\nthe prerogatives of the Crown, the more brilliant reputation of an\r\nassertor of the rights of the people.\r\n\r\nIn the popular view which Mr. Pitt found it convenient to take of this\r\nquestion, he was led, or fell voluntarily into some glaring errors, which\r\npervaded the whole of his reasonings on the subject. In his anxiety to\r\nprove the omnipotence of Parliament, he evidently confounded the Estates\r\nof the realm with the Legislature, [Footnote: Mr. Grattan and the Irish\r\nParliament carried this error still farther, and founded all their\r\nproceedings on the necessity of \"providing for the deficiency of the\r\nThird _Estate_.\"] and attributed to two branches of the latter such\r\npowers as are only legally possessed by the whole three in Parliament\r\nassembled. For the purpose, too, of flattering the people with the notion\r\nthat to them had now reverted the right of choosing their temporary\r\nSovereign, he applied a principle, which ought to be reserved for extreme\r\ncases, to an exigence by no means requiring this ultimate appeal,--the\r\ndefect in the government being such as the still existing Estates of the\r\nrealm, appointed to speak the will of the people, but superseding any\r\ndirect exercise of their power, were fully competent, as in the instance\r\nof the Revolution, to remedy. [Footnote: The most luminous view that has\r\nbeen taken of this Question is to be found in an Article of the Edinburgh\r\nReview, on the Regency of 1811,--written by one of the most learned and\r\nable men of our day, Mr. John Allen.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, the solemn use of such language as Mr. Pitt, in his over-acted\r\nWhiggism, employed upon this occasion,--namely, that the \"right\" of\r\nappointing a substitute for the Royal power was \"to be found in the voice\r\nand the sense of the people,\"--is applicable only to those conjunctures,\r\nbrought on by misrule and oppression, when all forms are lost in the\r\nnecessity of relief, and when the right of the people to change and\r\nchoose their rulers is among the most sacred and inalienable that either\r\nnature or social polity has ordained. But, to apply the language of that\r\nlast resource to the present emergency was to brandish the sword of\r\nGoliath [Footnote: A simile applied by Lord Somers to the power of\r\nImpeachment, which, he said, \"should be like Goliath's sword, kept in the\r\ntemple, and not used but upon great occasions.\"] on an occasion that by\r\nno means called for it.\r\n\r\nThe question of the Prince's claim,--in spite of the efforts of the\r\nPrince himself and of his Royal relatives to avert the agitation of\r\nit,--was, for evident reasons, forced into discussion by the Minister,\r\nand decided by a majority, not only of the two Houses but of the nation,\r\nin his favor. During one of the long debates to which the question gave\r\nrise, Mr. Sheridan allowed himself to be betrayed into some expressions,\r\nwhich, considering the delicate predicament in which the Prince was\r\nplaced by the controversy, were not marked with his usual tact and\r\nsagacity. In alluding to the claim of Right advanced for His Royal\r\nHighness, and deprecating any further agitation of it, he \"reminded the\r\nRight Honorable Gentleman (Mr. Pitt) of the danger of provoking that\r\nclaim to be asserted [a loud cry of hear! hear!], which, he observed, had\r\nnot yet been preferred. [Another cry of hear! hear!]\" This was the very\r\nlanguage that Mr. Pitt most wished his adversaries to assume, and,\r\naccordingly, he turned it to account with all his usual mastery and\r\nhaughtiness. \"He had now,\" he said, \"an additional reason for asserting\r\nthe authority of the House, and defining the boundaries of Right, when\r\nthe deliberative faculties of Parliament were invaded, and an indecent\r\nmenace thrown out to awe and influence their proceedings. In the\r\ndiscussion of the question, the House, he trusted, would do their duty,\r\nin spite of any threat that might be thrown out. Men, who felt their\r\nnative freedom, would not submit to a threat, however high the authority\r\nfrom which it might come.\" [Footnote: _Impartial Report of all the\r\nProceedings on the Subject of the Regency_]\r\n\r\nThe restrictions of the Prerogative with which Mr. Pitt thought proper to\r\nencumber the transfer of the Royal power to the Prince, formed the second\r\ngreat point of discussion between the parties, and brought equally\r\nadverse principles into play. Mr. Fox, still maintaining his position on\r\nthe side of Royalty, defended it with much more tenable weapons than the\r\nquestion of Right had enabled him to wield. So founded, indeed, in the\r\npurest principles of Whiggism did he consider his opposition, on this\r\nmemorable occasion, to any limitation of the Prerogative in the hands of\r\na Regent, that he has, in his History of James II., put those principles\r\ndeliberately upon record, as a fundamental article in the creed of his\r\nparty. The passage to which I allude occurs in his remarks upon the\r\nExclusion Bill; and as it contains, in a condensed form, the spirit of\r\nwhat he urged on the same point in 1789, I cannot do better than lay his\r\nown words before the reader. After expressing his opinion that, at the\r\nperiod of which he writes, the measure of exclusion from the monarchy\r\naltogether would have been preferable to any limitation of its powers, he\r\nproceeds to say:--\"The Whigs, who consider the powers of the Crown as a\r\ntrust for the people, a doctrine which the Tories themselves, when pushed\r\nin argument, will sometimes admit, naturally think it their duty rather\r\nto change the manager of the trust than impair the subject of it; while\r\nothers, who consider them as the right or property of the King, will as\r\nnaturally act as they would do in the case of any other property, and\r\nconsent to the loss or annihilation of any part of it, for the purpose of\r\npreserving the remainder to him, whom they style the rightful owner.\"\r\nFurther on he adds:--\"The Royal Prerogative ought, according to the\r\nWhigs, to be reduced to such powers as are in their exercise beneficial\r\nto the people; and of the benefit of these they will not rashly suffer\r\nthe people to be deprived, whether the executive power be in the hands of\r\nan hereditary or of an elective King, of a Regent, or of any other\r\ndenomination of magistrate; while, on the other hand, they who consider\r\nPrerogative with reference only to Royalty will, with equal readiness,\r\nconsent either to the extension or the suspension of its exercise, as the\r\noccasional interests of the Prince may seem to require.\"\r\n\r\nTaking this as a correct exposition of the doctrines of the two parties,\r\nof which Mr. Fox and Mr. Pitt may be considered to have been the\r\nrepresentatives in the Regency question of 1789, it will strike some\r\nminds that, however the Whig may flatter himself that the principle by\r\nwhich he is guided in such exigencies is favorable to liberty, and\r\nhowever the Tory may, with equal sincerity, believe his suspension of the\r\nPrerogative on these occasions to be advantageous to the Crown, yet that\r\nin both of the principles, so defined, there is an evident tendency to\r\nproduce effects, wholly different from those which the parties professing\r\nthem contemplate.\r\n\r\nOn the one side, to sanction from authority the notion, that there are\r\nsome powers of the Crown which may be safely dispensed with,--to accustom\r\nthe people to an abridged exercise of the Prerogative, with the risk of\r\nsuggesting to their minds that its full efficacy needs not be\r\nresumed,--to set an example, in short, of reducing the Kingly Power,\r\nwhich, by its success, may invite and authorize still further\r\nencroachments,--all these are dangers to which the alleged doctrine of\r\nToryism, whenever brought into practice, exposes its idol; and more\r\nparticularly in enlightened and speculative times, when the minds of men\r\nare in quest of the right and the useful, and when a superfluity of power\r\nis one of those abuses, which they are least likely to overlook or\r\ntolerate. In such seasons, the experiment of the Tory might lead to all\r\nthat he most deprecates, and the branches of the Prerogative, once cut\r\naway, might, like the lopped boughs of the fir-tree, never grow again.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Whig, who asserts that the Royal Prerogative ought\r\nto be reduced to such powers as are beneficial to the people, and yet\r\nstipulates, as an invariable principle, for the transfer of that\r\nPrerogative full and unimpaired, whenever it passes into other hands,\r\nappears, even more perhaps than the Tory, to throw an obstacle in the way\r\nof his own object. Circumstances, it is not denied, may arise when the\r\nincrease of the powers of the Crown, in other ways, may render it\r\nadvisable to control some of its established prerogatives. But, where are\r\nwe to find a fit moment for such a reform,--or what opening will be left\r\nfor it by this fastidious Whig principle, which, in 1680, could see no\r\nmiddle step between a change of the Succession and an undiminished\r\nmaintenance of the Prerogative, and which, in 1789, almost upon the heels\r\nof a Declaration that \"the power of the Crown had increased and ought to\r\nbe diminished,\" protested against even an experimental reduction of it!\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Fox, it is a distinctive characteristic of the Tory, to\r\nattach more importance to the person of the King than to his office. But,\r\nassuredly, the Tory is not singular in this want of political\r\nabstraction; and, in England, (from a defect, Hume thinks, inherent in\r\nall limited monarchies,) the personal qualities and opinions of the\r\nSovereign have considerable influence upon the whole course of public\r\naffairs,--being felt alike in that courtly sphere around them where their\r\nattraction acts, and in that outer circle of opposition where their\r\nrepulsion comes into play. To this influence, then, upon the government\r\nand the community, of which no abstraction can deprive the person of the\r\nmonarch, the Whig principle in question (which seems to consider\r\nentireness of Prerogative as necessary to a King, as the entireness of\r\nhis limbs was held to be among the Athenians,) superadds the vast power,\r\nboth actual and virtual, which would flow from the inviolability of the\r\nRoyal office, and forecloses, so far, the chance which the more pliant\r\nTory doctrine would leave open, of counteracting the effects of the\r\nKing's indirect personal influence, by curtailing or weakening the grasp\r\nof some of his direct regal powers. Ovid represents the Deity of Light\r\n(and on an occasion, too, which may be called a Regency question) as\r\ncrowned with movable rays, which might be put off when too strong or\r\ndazzling. But, according to this principle, the crown of Prerogative must\r\nkeep its rays fixed and immovable, and (as the poet expresses it)\r\n\"_circa caput_ OMNE _micantes_.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, however high the authorities, by which this Whig doctrine\r\nwas enforced in 1789, its manifest tendency, in most cases, to secure a\r\nperpetuity of superfluous powers to the Crown, appears to render it\r\nunfit, at least as an invariable principle, for any party professing to\r\nhave the liberty of the people for their object. The Prince, in his\r\nadmirable Letter upon the subject of the Regency to Mr. Pitt, was made to\r\nexpress the unwillingness which he felt \"that in his person an experiment\r\nshould be made to ascertain with how small a portion of kingly power the\r\nexecutive government of the country might be carried on;\"--but\r\nimagination has not far to go in supposing a case, where the enormous\r\npatronage vested in the Crown, and the consequent increase of a Royal\r\nbias through the community, might give such an undue and unsafe\r\npreponderance to that branch of the Legislature, as would render any safe\r\nopportunity, however acquired, of ascertaining with _how much less\r\npower_ the executive government could be carried on, most acceptable,\r\nin spite of any dogmas to the contrary, to all true lovers as well of the\r\nmonarchy as of the people.\r\n\r\nHaving given thus much consideration to the opinions and principles,\r\nprofessed on both sides of this constitutional question, it is\r\nmortifying, after all, to be obliged to acknowledge, that, in the\r\nrelative situation of the two parties at the moment, may be found perhaps\r\nthe real, and but too natural, source of the decidedly opposite views\r\nwhich they took of the subject. Mr. Pitt, about to surrender the\r\npossession of power to his rival, had a very intelligible interest in\r\nreducing the value of the transfer, and (as a retreating army spike the\r\nguns they leave behind) rendering the engines of Prerogative as useless\r\nas possible to his successor. Mr. Fox, too, had as natural a motive to\r\noppose such a design; and, aware that the chief aim of these restrictive\r\nmeasures was to entail upon the Whig ministry of the Regent a weak\r\nGovernment and strong Opposition, would, of course, eagerly welcome the\r\naid of any abstract principle, that might sanction him in resisting such\r\na mutilation of the Royal power;--well knowing that (as in the case of\r\nthe Peerage Bill in the reign of George I.) the proceedings altogether\r\nwere actuated more by ill-will to the successor in the trust, than by any\r\nsincere zeal for the purity of its exercise.\r\n\r\nHad the situations of the two leaders been reversed, it is more than\r\nprobable that their modes of thinking and acting would have been so\r\nlikewise. Mr. Pitt, with the prospect of power before his eyes, would\r\nhave been still more strenuous, perhaps, for the unbroken transmission of\r\nthe Prerogative--his natural leaning on the side of power being increased\r\nby his own approaching share in it. Mr. Fox, too, if stopped, like his\r\nrival, in a career of successful administration, and obliged to surrender\r\nup the reins of the state to Tory guidance, might have found in his\r\npopular principles a still more plausible pretext, for the abridgment of\r\npower in such unconstitutional hands. He might even too, perhaps, (as his\r\nIndia Bill warrants us in supposing) have been tempted into the same sort\r\nof alienation of the Royal patronage, as that which Mr. Pitt now\r\npractised in the establishment of the Queen, and have taken care to leave\r\nbehind him a stronghold of Whiggism, to facilitate the resumption of his\r\nposition, whenever an opportunity might present itself. Such is human\r\nnature, even in its noblest specimens, and so are the strongest spirits\r\nshaped by the mould in which chance and circumstances have placed them.\r\n\r\nMr. Sheridan spoke frequently in the Debates on this question, but his\r\nmost important agency lay in the less public business connected with it.\r\nHe was the confidential adviser of the Prince throughout, directed every\r\nstep he took, and was the author of most of his correspondence on the\r\nsubject. There is little doubt, I think, that the celebrated and masterly\r\nLetter to Mr. Pitt, which by some persons has been attributed to Burke,\r\nand by others to Sir Gilbert Elliot (afterwards Lord Minto), was\r\nprincipally the production of Mr. Sheridan. For the supposition that it\r\nwas written by Burke there are, besides the merits of the production, but\r\nvery scanty grounds. So little was he at that period in those habits of\r\nconfidence with the Prince, which would entitle him to be selected for\r\nsuch a task in preference to Sheridan, that but eight or ten days before\r\nthe date of this letter (Jan. 2.) he had declared in the House of\r\nCommons, that \"he knew as little of the inside of Carlton House as he did\r\nof Buckingham House.\" Indeed, the violent state of this extraordinary\r\nman's temper, during the whole of the discussions and proceedings on the\r\nRegency, would have rendered him, even had his intimacy with the Prince\r\nbeen closer, an unfit person for the composition of a document, requiring\r\nso much caution, temper, and delicacy.\r\n\r\nThe conjecture that Sir Gilbert Elliot was the author of it is somewhat\r\nmore plausible,--that gentleman being at this period high in the favor of\r\nthe Prince, and possessing talents sufficient to authorize the suspicion\r\n(which was in itself a reputation) that he had been the writer of a\r\ncomposition so admirable. But it seems hardly necessary to go farther, in\r\nquest of its author, than Mr. Sheridan, who, besides being known to have\r\nacted the part of the Prince's adviser through the whole transaction, is\r\nproved by the rough copies found among his papers, to have written\r\nseveral other important documents connected with the Regency.\r\n\r\nI may also add that an eminent statesman of the present day, who was at\r\nthat period, though very young, a distinguished friend of Mr. Sheridan,\r\nand who has shown by the ability of his own State Papers that he has not\r\nforgot the lessons of that school from which this able production\r\nemanated, remembers having heard some passages of the Letter discussed in\r\nBruton-street, as if it were then in the progress of composition, and has\r\nalways, I believe, been under the impression that it was principally the\r\nwork of Mr. Sheridan. [Footnote: To this authority may be added also that\r\nof the Bishop of Winchester, who says,--\"Mr. Sheridan was supposed to\r\nhave been materially concerned in drawing up this admirable composition.\"]\r\n\r\nI had written thus far on the subject of this Letter--and shall leave\r\nwhat I have written as a memorial of the fallacy of such\r\nconjectures--when, having still some doubts of my correctness in\r\nattributing the honor of the composition to Sheridan, I resolved to ask\r\nthe opinion of my friend, Sir James Mackintosh, a person above all others\r\nqualified, by relationship of talent, to recognize and hold parley with\r\nthe mighty spirit of Burke, in whatever shape the \"Royal Dane\" may\r\nappear. The strong impression on his mind--amounting almost to\r\ncertainty--was that no other hand but that of Burke could have written\r\nthe greater part of the letter; [Footnote: It is amusing to observe how\r\ntastes differ;--the following is the opinion entertained of this letter\r\nby a gentleman, who, I understand, and can easily believe, is an old\r\nestablished Reviewer. After mentioning that it was attributed to the pen\r\nof Burke, he adds,--\"The story, however, does not seem entitled to much\r\ncredit, for the internal character of the paper is too vapid and heavy\r\nfor the genius of Burke, whose ardent mind would assuredly have diffused\r\nvigor into the composition, and the correctness of whose judgment would\r\nas certainly have preserved it from the charge of inelegance and\r\ngrammatical deficiency.\"--DR. WATKINS, _Life of Sheridan_. Such, in\r\nnine cases out of ten, are the periodical guides of public taste.] and by\r\na more diligent inquiry, in which his kindness assisted me, it has been\r\nascertained that his opinion was, as it could not fail to be, correct.\r\nThe following extract from a letter written by Lord Minto at the time,\r\nreferring obviously to the surmise that he was, himself, the author of\r\nthe paper, confirms beyond a doubt the fact, that it was written almost\r\nsolely by Burke:--\r\n\r\n\"_January 31st, 1789._\r\n\r\n\"There was not a word of the Prince's letter to Pitt mine. It was\r\noriginally Burke's, altered a little, but not improved, by Sheridan and\r\nother critics. The answer made by the Prince yesterday to the Address of\r\nthe two Houses was entirely mine, and done in a great hurry half an hour\r\nbefore it was to be delivered.\"\r\n\r\nWhile it is with regret I give up the claim of Mr. Sheridan to this fine\r\nspecimen of English composition, it but adds to my intense admiration of\r\nBurke--not on account of the beauty of the writing, for his fame required\r\nno such accession--but from that triumph of mind over temper which it\r\nexhibits--that forgetfulness of _Self_, the true, transmigrating\r\npower of genius, which enabled him thus to pass his spirit into the\r\nstation of Royalty, and to assume all the calm dignity, both of style and\r\nfeeling, that became it.\r\n\r\nIt was to be expected that the conduct of Lord Thurlow at this period\r\nshould draw down upon him all the bitterness of those who were in the\r\nsecret of his ambidextrous policy, and who knew both his disposition to\r\ndesert, and the nature of the motives that prevented him. To Sheridan, in\r\nparticular, such a result of a negotiation, in which he had been the\r\nprincipal mover and mediator, could not be otherwise than deeply\r\nmortifying. Of all the various talents with which he was gifted, his\r\ndexterity in political intrigue and management was that of which he\r\nappears to have been most vain; and this vanity it was that, at a later\r\nperiod of his life, sometimes led him to branch off from the main body of\r\nhis party, upon secret and solitary enterprises of ingenuity, which--as\r\nmay be expected from all such independent movements of a\r\npartisan--generally ended in thwarting his friends and embarrassing\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIn the debate on that clause of the Bill, which restricted the Regent\r\nfrom granting places or pensions in reversion, Mr. Sheridan is\r\nrepresented as having attacked Lord Thurlow in terms of the most\r\nunqualified severity,--speaking of \"the natural ferocity and sturdiness\r\nof his temper,\" and of \"his brutal bluffness.\" But to such abuse,\r\nunseasoned by wit, Mr. Sheridan was not at all likely to have\r\ncondescended, being well aware that, \"as in smooth oil the razor best is\r\nset,\" so satire is whetted to its most perfect keenness by courtesy. His\r\nclumsy reporters have, in this, as in almost all other instances,\r\nmisrepresented him.\r\n\r\nWith equal personality, but more playfulness, Mr. Burke, in exposing that\r\nwretched fiction, by which the Great Seal was converted into the Third\r\nBranch of the Legislature, and the assent of the King forged to a Bill,\r\nin which his incapacity to give either assent or dissent was declared,\r\nthus expressed himself:--\"But what is to be done when the Crown is in a\r\n_deliquium_? It was intended, he had heard, to set up a man with\r\nblack brows and a large wig, a kind of scare-crow to the two Houses, who\r\nwas to give a fictitious assent in the royal name--and this to be binding\r\non the people at large!\" The following remarkable passage, too, in a\r\nsubsequent Speech, is almost too well known to be cited:--\"The other\r\nHouse,\" he said, \"were not yet perhaps recovered from that extraordinary\r\nburst of the pathetic which had been exhibited the other evening; they\r\nhad not yet dried their eyes, or been restored to their former placidity,\r\nand were unqualified to attend, to new business. The tears shed in that\r\nHouse on the occasion to which he alluded, were not the tears of patriots\r\nfor dying laws, but of Lords for their expiring places. The iron tears,\r\nwhich flowed down Pluto's cheek, rather resembled the dismal bubbling of\r\nthe Styx, than the gentle murmuring streams of Aganippe.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Lord Thurlow was thus treated by the party whom he had so nearly\r\njoined, he was but coldly welcomed back by the Minister whom he had so\r\nnearly deserted. His reconciliation, too, with the latter was by no means\r\neither sincere or durable,--the renewal of friendship between\r\npoliticians, on such occasions, being generally like that which the\r\nDiable Boiteux describes, as having taken place between himself and a\r\nbrother sprite,--\"We were reconciled, embraced, and have hated each other\r\nheartily ever since.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Regency, indeed, and the transactions connected with it, may be\r\nfound the source of most of those misunderstandings and enmities, which\r\nbroke out soon after among the eminent men of that day, and were attended\r\nwith consequences so important to themselves and the country. By the\r\ndifference just mentioned, between Mr. Pitt and Lord Thurlow, the\r\nministerial arrangements of 1793 were facilitated, and the learned Lord,\r\nafter all his sturdy pliancy, consigned to a life of ineffectual\r\ndiscontent ever after.\r\n\r\nThe disagreement between Mr. Burke and Mr. Fox, if not actually\r\noriginating now--and its foundation had been, perhaps, laid from the\r\nbeginning, in the total dissimilarity of their dispositions and\r\nsentiments--was, at least, considerably ripened and accelerated by the\r\nevents of this period, and by the discontent that each of them, like\r\npartners in unsuccessful play, was known to feel at the mistakes which\r\nthe other had committed in the game. Mr. Fox had, unquestionably, every\r\nreason to lament as well as blame the violence and virulence by which his\r\nassociate had disgraced the contest. The effect, indeed, produced upon\r\nthe public by the irreverent sallies of Burke, and by the too evident\r\ntriumph, both of hate and hope, with which he regarded the calamitous\r\nsituation of the King, contributed not a little to render still lower the\r\nalready low temperature of popularity at which his party stood throughout\r\nthe country. It seemed as if a long course of ineffectual struggle in\r\npolitics, of frustrated ambition and unrewarded talents, had at length\r\nexasperated his mind to a degree beyond endurance; and the extravagances\r\ninto which he was hurried in his speeches on this question, appear to\r\nhave been but the first workings of that impatience of a losing cause--\r\nthat resentment of failure, and disgust at his partners in it--which\r\nsoon afterwards found such a signal opportunity of exploding.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Burke, upon far less grounds, was equally discontented with his\r\nco-operators in this emergency, may be collected from the following\r\npassage of a letter addressed by him in the summer of this year to Lord\r\nCharlemont, and given by Hardy in his Memoirs of that nobleman:--\r\n\r\n\"Perpetual failure, even though nothing in that failure can be fixed on\r\nthe improper choice of the object or the injudicious choice of means,\r\nwill detract every day more and more from a man's credit, until he ends\r\nwithout success and without reputation. In fact, a constant pursuit even\r\nof the best objects, without adequate instruments, detracts something\r\nfrom the opinion of a man's judgment. This, I think, may be in part the\r\ncause of the inactivity of others of our friends who are in the vigor of\r\nlife and in possession of a great degree of lead and authority. I do not\r\nblame them, though I lament that state of the public mind, in which the\r\npeople can consider the exclusion of such talents and such virtues from\r\ntheir service, as a point gained to them. The only point in which I can\r\nfind any thing to blame in these friends, is their not taking the\r\neffectual means, which they certainly had in their power, of making an\r\nhonorable retreat from their prospect of power into the possession of\r\nreputation, by an effectual defence of themselves. There was an\r\nopportunity which was not made use of for that purpose, and which could\r\nscarcely have failed of turning the tables on their adversaries.\"\r\n\r\nAnother instance of the embittering influence of these transactions may\r\nbe traced in their effects upon Mr. Burke and Mr. Sheridan--between whom\r\nthere had arisen a degree of emulation, amounting to jealousy, which,\r\nthough hitherto chiefly confined to one of the parties, received on this\r\noccasion such an addition of fuel, as spread it equally through the minds\r\nof both, and conduced, in no small degree, to the explosion that\r\nfollowed. Both Irishmen, and both adventurers in a region so much\r\nelevated above their original station, it was but natural that some such\r\nfeeling should kindle between them; and that, as Burke was already\r\nmid-way in his career, when Sheridan was but entering the field, the\r\nstirrings, whether of emulation or envy, should first be felt by the\r\nlatter. It is, indeed, said that in the ceremonial of Hastings's Trial,\r\nthe privileges enjoyed by Burke, as a Privy-councillor, were regarded\r\nwith evident uneasiness by his brother Manager, who could not as yet\r\nboast the distinction of Right Honorable before his name. As soon,\r\nhowever, as the rapid run of Sheridan's success had enabled him to\r\novertake his veteran rival, this feeling of jealousy took possession in\r\nfull force of the latter,--and the close relations of intimacy and\r\nconfidence, to which Sheridan was now admitted both by Mr. Fox and the\r\nPrince, are supposed to have been not the least of those causes of\r\nirritation and disgust, by which Burke was at length driven to break with\r\nthe party altogether, and to show his gigantic strength at parting, by\r\ncarrying away some of the strongest pillars of Whiggism in his grasp.\r\n\r\nLastly, to this painful list of the feuds, whose origin is to be found in\r\nthe times and transactions of which we are speaking, may be added that\r\nslight, but too visible cloud of misunderstanding, which arose between\r\nMr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan, and which, though it never darkened into any\r\nthing serious, continued to pervade their intercourse with each other to\r\nthe last--exhibiting itself, on the part of Mr. Fox, in a degree of\r\ndistrustful reserve not natural to him, and, on the side of Sheridan, in\r\nsome of those counter-workings of influence, which, as I have already\r\nsaid, he was sometimes induced by his love of the diplomacy of politics\r\nto practise.\r\n\r\nAmong the appointments named in contemplation of a Regency, the place of\r\nTreasurer of the Navy was allotted to Mr. Sheridan. He would never,\r\nhowever, admit the idea of certainty in any of the arrangements so\r\nsanguinely calculated upon, but continually impressed upon his impatient\r\nfriends the possibility, if not probability, of the King's recovery. He\r\nhad even refused to look at the plan of the apartments, which he himself\r\nwas to occupy in Somerset House; and had but just agreed that it should\r\nbe sent to him for examination, on the very day when the King was\r\ndeclared convalescent by Dr. Warren. \"He entered his own house (to use\r\nthe words of the relater of the anecdote) at dinner-time with the news.\r\nThere were present,--besides Mrs. Sheridan and his sister,--Tickell, who,\r\non the change of administration, was to have been immediately brought\r\ninto Parliament,--Joseph Richardson, who was to have had Tickell's place\r\nof Commissioner of the Stamp-office,--Mr. Reid, and some others. Not one\r\nof the company but had cherished expectations from the approaching\r\nchange--not one of them, however, had lost so much as Mr. Sheridan. With\r\nhis wonted equanimity he announced the sudden turn affairs had taken, and\r\nlooking round him cheerfully, as he filled a large glass, said,--'Let us\r\nall join in drinking His Majesty's speedy recovery.'\"\r\n\r\nThe measures which the Irish Parliament adopted on this occasion, would\r\nhave been productive of anomalies, both theoretical and practical, had\r\nthe continued illness of the King allowed the projected Regency to take\r\nplace. As it was, the most material consequence that ensued was the\r\ndismissal from their official situations of Mr. Ponsonby and other\r\npowerful individuals, by which the Whig party received such an accession\r\nof strength, as enabled them to work out for their country the few\r\nblessings of liberty that still remain to her. Among the victims to their\r\nvotes on this question was Mr. Charles Sheridan, who, on the recovery of\r\nthe King, was dismissed from his office of Secretary of War, but received\r\ncompensation by a pension of 1200_l_. a year, with the reversion of\r\n300_l_. a year to his wife.\r\n\r\nThe ready and ardent burst of devotion with which Ireland, at this\r\nmoment, like the Pythagoreans at their morning worship, turned to welcome\r\nwith her Harp the Rising Sun, was long remembered by the object of her\r\nhomage with pride and gratitude,--and, let us trust, is not even yet\r\nentirely forgotten. [Footnote: This vain hope was expressed before the\r\nlate decision on the Catholic question had proved to the Irish that,\r\nwhere their rights are concerned, neither public nor private pledges are\r\nregarded.]\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that to Mr. Sheridan, at this period, was\r\nentrusted the task of drawing up several of the State Papers of the\r\nHeir-Apparent. From the rough copies of these papers that have fallen\r\ninto my hands, I shall content myself with selecting two Letters--the\r\nfirst of which was addressed by the Prince to the Queen, immediately\r\nafter the communication to her Majesty of the Resolution of the two\r\nHouses placing the Royal Household under her control.\r\n\r\n\"Before Your Majesty gives an answer to the application for your Royal\r\npermission to place under Your Majesty's separate authority the direction\r\nand appointment of the King's household, and thereby to separate from the\r\ndifficult and arduous situation which I am unfortunately called upon to\r\nfill, the accustomed and necessary support which has ever belonged to it,\r\npermit me, with every sentiment of duty and affection towards Your\r\nMajesty, to entreat your attentive perusal of the papers which I have the\r\nhonor to enclose. They contain a sketch of the plan now proposed to be\r\ncarried into execution as communicated to me by Mr. Pitt, and the\r\nsentiments which I found myself bound in duty to declare in reply to that\r\ncommunication. I take the liberty of lodging these papers in Your\r\nMajesty's hands, confiding that, whenever it shall please Providence to\r\nremove the malady with which the King my father is now unhappily\r\nafflicted, Your Majesty will, in justice to me and to those of the Royal\r\nfamily whose affectionate concurrence and support I have received, take\r\nthe earliest opportunity of submitting them to his Royal perusal, in\r\norder that no interval of time may elapse before he is in possession of\r\nthe true motives and principles upon which I have acted. I here solemnly\r\nrepeat to Your Majesty, that among those principles there is not one\r\nwhich influences my mind so much as the firm persuasion I have, that my\r\nconduct in endeavoring to maintain unimpaired and undivided the just\r\nrights, prerogatives, and dignity of the Crown, in the person of the\r\nKing's representative, is the only line of conduct which would entitle me\r\nto His Majesty's approbation, or enable me to stand with confidence in\r\nhis Royal presence on the happy day of his recovery;--and, on the\r\ncontrary, that those who, under color of respect and attachment to his\r\nRoyal person, have contrived this project for enfeebling and degrading\r\nthe executive authority of the realm, will be considered by him as having\r\nrisked the happiness of his people and the security of the throne itself,\r\nby establishing a fatal precedent which may hereafter be urged against\r\nhis own authority, on as plausible pretences, or revived against the just\r\nrights of his family. In speaking my opinions of the motive of the\r\nprojectors of this scheme, I trust I need not assure Your Majesty that\r\nthe respect, duty, and affection I owe to Your Majesty have never\r\nsuffered me for a single moment to consider you as countenancing, in the\r\nslightest degree, their plan or their purposes. I have the firmest\r\nreliance on Your Majesty's early declaration to me, on the subject of\r\npublic affairs, at the commencement of our common calamity; and, whatever\r\nmay be the efforts of evil or interested advisers, I have the same\r\nconfidence that you will never permit or endure that the influence of\r\nyour respected name shall be profaned to the purpose of distressing the\r\ngovernment and insulting the person of your son. How far those, who are\r\nevidently pursuing both these objects, may be encouraged by Your\r\nMajesty's acceptance of one part of the powers purposed to be lodged in\r\nyour hands, I will not presume to say. [Footnote: In speaking of the\r\nextraordinary _imperium in imperio_, with which the command of so\r\nmuch power and patronage would have invested the Queen, the Annual\r\nRegister (Robinson's) remarks justly, \"It was not the least extraordinary\r\ncircumstance in these transactions, that the Queen could be prevailed\r\nupon to lend her name to a project which would eventually have placed her\r\nin avowed rivalship with her son, and, at a moment when her attention\r\nmight seem to be absorbed by domestic calamity, have established her at\r\nthe head of a political party.\"] The proposition has assumed the shape of\r\na Resolution of Parliament, and therefore I am silent.\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty will do me the honor to weigh the opinions I formed and\r\ndeclared before Parliament had entertained the plan, and, with those\r\nbefore you, your own good judgment will decide. I have only to add that\r\nwhatever that decision may be, nothing will ever alter the interest of\r\ntrue affection and inviolable duty,\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe second Letter that I shall give, from the rough copy of Mr. Sheridan,\r\nwas addressed by the Prince to the King after his recovery, announcing\r\nthe intention of His Royal Highness to submit to His Majesty a Memorial,\r\nin vindication of his own conduct and that of his Royal brother the Duke\r\nof York throughout the whole of the proceedings consequent upon His\r\nMajesty's indisposition.\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"Thinking it probable that I should have been honored with your commands\r\nto attend Your Majesty on Wednesday last, I have unfortunately lost the\r\nopportunity of paying my duty to Your Majesty before your departure from\r\nWeymouth. The account? I have received of Your Majesty's health have\r\ngiven me the greatest satisfaction, and should it be Your Majesty's\r\nintention to return to Weymouth, I trust, Sir, there will be no\r\nimpropriety in my _then_ entreating Your Majesty's gracious\r\nattention to a point of the greatest moment to the peace of my own mind,\r\nand one in which I am convinced Your Majesty's feelings are equally\r\ninterested. Your Majesty's letter to my brother the Duke of Clarence, in\r\nMay last, was the first direct intimation I had ever received that my\r\nconduct, and that of my brother the Duke of York, during Your Majesty's\r\nlate lamented illness, had brought on us the heavy misfortune of Your\r\nMajesty's displeasure. I should be wholly unworthy the return of Your\r\nMajesty's confidence and good opinion, which will ever be the first\r\nobjects of my life, if I could have read the passage I refer to in that\r\nletter without the deepest sorrow and regret for the effect produced on\r\nYour Majesty's mind; though at the same time I felt the firmest\r\npersuasion that Your Majesty's generosity and goodness would never permit\r\nthat effect to _remain_, without affording us an opportunity of\r\nknowing what had been urged against us, of replying to our accusers, and\r\nof justifying ourselves, if the means of justification were in our power.\r\n\r\n\"Great however as my impatience and anxiety were on this subject, I felt\r\nit a superior consideration not to intrude any unpleasing or agitating\r\ndiscussions upon Your Majesty's attention, during an excursion devoted to\r\nthe ease and amusement necessary for the re-establishment of Your\r\nMajesty's health. I determined to sacrifice my own feelings, and to wait\r\nwith resignation till the fortunate opportunity should arrive, when Your\r\nMajesty's own paternal goodness would, I was convinced, lead you even to\r\n_invite_ your sons to that fair hearing, which your justice would\r\nnot deny to the meanest individual of your subjects. In this painful\r\ninterval I have employed myself in drawing up a full statement and\r\naccount of my conduct during the period alluded to, and of the motives\r\nand circumstances which influenced me. When these shall be humbly\r\nsubmitted to Your Majesty's consideration, I may be possibly found to\r\nhave erred in judgment, and to have acted on mistaken principles, but I\r\nhave the most assured conviction that I shall not be found to have been\r\ndeficient in that duteous affection to Your Majesty which nothing shall\r\never diminish. Anxious for every thing that may contribute to the comfort\r\nand satisfaction of Your Majesty's mind, I cannot omit this opportunity\r\nof lamenting those appearances of a less gracious disposition in the\r\nQueen, towards my brothers and myself, than we were accustomed to\r\nexperience; and to assure Your Majesty that if by your affectionate\r\ninterposition these most unpleasant sensations should be happily removed,\r\nit would be an event not less grateful to our minds than satisfactory to\r\nYour Majesty's own benign disposition. I will not longer. &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\"G. P.\"\r\n\r\nThe Statement here announced by His Royal Highness (a copy of which I\r\nhave seen, occupying, with its Appendix, near a hundred folio pages), is\r\nsupposed to have been drawn up by Lord Minto.\r\n\r\nTo descend from documents of such high import to one of a much humbler\r\nnature, the following curious memorial was presented this year to Mr.\r\nSheridan, by a literary gentleman whom the Whig party thought it worth\r\nwhile to employ in their service, and who, as far as industry went,\r\nappears to have been not unworthy of his hire, Simonides is said to be\r\nthe first author that ever wrote for pay, but Simonides little dreamt of\r\nthe perfection to which his craft would one day be brought.\r\n\r\n_Memorial for Dr. W. T.,_ [Footnote: This industrious Scotchman (of\r\nwhose name I have only given the initials) was not without some share of\r\nhumor. On hearing that a certain modern philosopher had carried his\r\nbelief in the perfectibility of all living things so far, as to say that\r\nhe did not despair of seeing the day when tigers themselves might be\r\neducated, Dr. T. exclaimed, \"I should like dearly to see him in a cage\r\nwith _two_ of his pupils!\"]\r\n\r\n_Fitzroy-street, Fitzroy-Chapel._\r\n\r\n\"In May, 1787, Dr. Parr, in the name of his political friends, engaged\r\nDr. T. to embrace those opportunities, which his connections with\r\nbooksellers and periodical publications might afford him, of supporting\r\nthe principles of their party. Mr. Sheridan in August, 1787, gave two\r\nnotes, 50_l_. each, to Dr. T. for the first year's service, which\r\nnotes were paid at different periods--the first by Mr. Sheridan at\r\nBrookes's, in January, 1788, the second by Mr. Windham in May, 1788. Mr.\r\nSheridan, in different conversations, encouraged Dr. T. to go on with the\r\nexpectation of a like sum yearly, or 50_l_. half yearly. Dr. T. with\r\nthis encouragement engaged in different publications for the purpose of\r\nthis agreement. He is charged for the most part with the Political and\r\nHistorical articles in the Analytic Review, and he also occasionally\r\nwrites the Political Appendix to the English Review, of which\r\nparticularly he wrote that for April last, and that for June last. He\r\nalso every week writes an abridgment of Politics for the Whitehall\r\nEvening Post, and a Political Review every month for a Sunday paper\r\nentitled the Review and Sunday Advertiser. In a Romance, entitled\r\n'Mammoth, or Human Nature Displayed, &c.,' Dr. T. has shown how mindful\r\nhe is on all occasions of his engagements to those who confide in him. He\r\nhas also occasionally moved other engines, which it would be tedious and\r\nmight appear too trifling to mention. Dr. T. is not ignorant that\r\nuncommon charges have happened in the course of this last year, that is,\r\nthe year preceding May, 1789. Instead of 100_l_., therefore, he will\r\nbe satisfied with 50_l_ for that year, provided that this abatement\r\nshall not form a precedent against his claim of 100_l_. annually, if\r\nhis further services shall be deemed acceptable. There is one point on\r\nwhich Dr. T. particularly reserved himself, namely, to make no attack on\r\nMr. Hastings, and this will be attested by Dr. Parr, Mr. Sheridan, and,\r\nif the Doctor rightly recollects, by Mr. Windham.\r\n\r\n\"_Fitzroy-street, 21st July, 1789.\"_\r\n\r\nTaking into account all the various circumstances that concurred to\r\nglorify this period of Sheridan's life, we may allow ourselves, I think,\r\nto pause upon it as the apex of the pyramid, and, whether we consider his\r\nfame, his talents, or his happiness, may safely say, \"Here is their\r\nhighest point.\"\r\n\r\nThe new splendor which his recent triumphs in eloquence had added to a\r\nreputation already so illustrious,--the power which he seemed to have\r\nacquired over the future destinies of the country, by his acknowledged\r\ninfluence in the councils of the Heir Apparent, and the tribute paid to\r\nhim, by the avowal both of friends and foes, that he had used this\r\ninfluence in the late trying crisis of the Regency, with a judgment and\r\ndelicacy that proved him worthy of it,--all these advantages, both\r\nbrilliant and solid, which subsequent circumstances but too much tended\r\nto weaken, at this moment surrounded him in their newest lustre and\r\npromise.\r\n\r\nHe was just now, too, in the first enjoyment of a feeling, of which habit\r\nmust have afterwards dulled the zest, namely, the proud consciousness of\r\nhaving surmounted the disadvantages of birth and station, and placed\r\nhimself on a level with the highest and noblest of the land. This footing\r\nin the society of the great he could only have attained by parliamentary\r\neminence;--as a mere writer, with all his genius, he never would have\r\nbeen thus admitted _ad eundem_ among them. Talents, in literature or\r\nscience, unassisted by the advantages of birth, may lead to association\r\nwith the great, but rarely to equality;--it is a passport through the\r\nwell-guarded frontier, but no title to naturalization within. By him, who\r\nhas not been born among them, this can only be achieved by politics. In\r\nthat arena, which they look upon as their own, the Legislature of the\r\nland, let a man of genius, like Sheridan, but assert his supremacy,--at\r\nonce all these barriers of reserve and pride give way, and he takes, by\r\nstorm, a station at their side, which a Shakspeare or a Newton would but\r\nhave enjoyed by courtesy.\r\n\r\nIn fixing upon this period of Sheridan's life, as the most shining aera\r\nof his talents as well as his fame, it is not meant to be denied that in\r\nhis subsequent warfare with the Minister, during the stormy time of the\r\nFrench Revolution, he exhibited a prowess of oratory no less suited to\r\nthat actual service, than his eloquence on the trial of Hastings had been\r\nto such lighter tilts and tournaments of peace. But the effect of his\r\ntalents was far less striking;--the current of feeling through England\r\nwas against him;--and, however greatly this added to the merit of his\r\nefforts, it deprived him of that echo from the public heart, by which the\r\nvoice of the orator is endued with a sort of multiplied life, and, as it\r\nwere, survives itself. In the panic, too, that followed the French\r\nRevolution, all eloquence, but that from the lips of Power, was\r\ndisregarded, and the voice of him at the helm was the only one listened\r\nto in the storm.\r\n\r\nOf his happiness, at the period of which we are speaking, in the midst of\r\nso much success and hope, there can be but little doubt. Though pecuniary\r\nembarrassment, as appears from his papers, had already begun to weave its\r\nfatal net around him, there was as yet little more than sufficed to give\r\nexercise to his ingenuity, and the resources of the Drury-Lane treasury\r\nwere still in full nightly flow. The charms, by which his home was\r\nembellished, were such as few other homes could boast; and, if any thing\r\nmade it less happy than it ought to be, the cause was to be found in the\r\nvery brilliancy of his life and attractions, and in those triumphs out of\r\nthe sphere of domestic love, to which his vanity, perhaps, oftener than\r\nhis feelings, impelled him.\r\n\r\nAmong his own immediate associates, the gaiety of his spirits amounted\r\nalmost to boyishness. He delighted in all sorts of dramatic tricks and\r\ndisguises; and the lively parties, with which his country-house was\r\nalways filled, were kept in momentary expectation of some new device for\r\ntheir mystification or amusement. [Footnote: To give some idea of the\r\nyouthful tone of this society, I shall mention one out of many anecdotes\r\nrelated to me by persons who themselves been ornaments of it. The ladies\r\nhaving one evening received the gentlemen in masquerade dresses, which\r\nwith their obstinate silence, made it impossible to distinguish one from\r\nthe other, the gentlemen, in their turn invited the ladies next evening,\r\nto a similar trial of conjecture on themselves; and notice being given\r\nthat they were ready dressed, Mrs. Sheridan and her companions were\r\nadmitted into the dining room, where they found a party of Turks, sitting\r\nsilent and masked around the table. After a long course of the usual\r\nguesses, examinations, &c, &c., and each lady having taken the arm of the\r\nperson she was most sure of, they heard a burst of laughter through the\r\nhalf open door, and looking there, saw the gentlemen themselves in their\r\nproper person--the masks upon whom they had been lavishing their\r\nsagacity being no other than the maid servants of the house, who had been\r\nthus dressed up to deceive them.] It was not unusual to dispatch a man\r\nand horse seven or eight miles for a piece of crape or a mask, or some\r\nother such trifle for these frolics. His friends Tickell and Richardson,\r\nboth men of wit and humor, and the former possessing the same degree of\r\nlight animal spirits as himself, were the constant companions of all his\r\nsocial hours, and kept up with him that ready rebound of pleasantry,\r\nwithout which the play of wit languishes.\r\n\r\nThere is a letter, written one night by Richardson at Tunbridge\r\n[Footnote: In the year 1790, when Mrs. Sheridan was trying the waters of\r\nTunbridge for her health. In a letter to Sheridan's sister from this\r\nplace, dated September 1790, she says: \"I drink the waters once a day,\r\nand ride and drive all the forenoon, which makes me ravenous when I\r\nreturn. I feel I am in very good health, and I am in high beauty, two\r\ncircumstances which ought and do put me in high good humor.\"] (after\r\nwaiting five long hours for Sheridan,) so full of that mixture of\r\nmelancholy and humor, which chequered the mind of this interesting man,\r\nthat, as illustrative of the character of one of Sheridan's most intimate\r\nfriends, it may be inserted here:--\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SHERIDAN,\r\n\r\n\"_Half-past nine, Mount Ephraim._\r\n\r\n\"After you had been gone an hour or two I got moped damnably. Perhaps\r\nthere is a sympathy between the corporeal and the mind's eye. In the\r\nTemple I can't see far before me, and seldom extend my speculations on\r\nthings to come into any fatiguing sketch of reflection.--From your\r\nwindow, however, there was a tedious scope of black atmosphere, that I\r\nthink won my mind into a sort of fellow-travellership, pacing me again\r\nthrough the cheerless waste of the past, and presenting hardly one little\r\nrarified cloud to give a dim ornament to the future;--not a star to be\r\nseen;--no permanent light to gild my horizon;--only the fading helps to\r\ntransient gaiety in the lamps of Tunbridge;--no Law coffee-house at hand,\r\nor any other house of relief;--no antagonist to bicker one into a control\r\nof one's cares by a successful opposition, [Footnote: Richardson was\r\nremarkable for his love of disputation; and Tickell, when hard pressed by\r\nhim in argument, used often, as a last resource, to assume the voice and\r\nmanner of Mr. Fox, which he had the power of mimicking so exactly, that\r\nRichardson confessed he sometimes stood awed and silenced by the\r\nresemblance.\r\n\r\nThis disputatious humor of Richardson was once turned to account by\r\nSheridan in a very characteristic manner. Having had a hackney-coach in\r\nemploy for five or six hours, and not being provided with the means of\r\npaying it, he happened to espy Richardson in the street, and proposed to\r\ntake him in the coach some part of his way. The offer being accepted,\r\nSheridan lost no time in starting a subject of conversation, on which he\r\nknew his companion was sure to become argumentative and animated. Having,\r\nby well-managed contradiction, brought him to the proper pitch of\r\nexcitement, he affected to grow impatient and angry, himself, and saying\r\nthat \"he could not think of staying in the same coach with a person that\r\nwould use such language,\" pulled the check-string, and desired the\r\ncoachman to let him out. Richardson, wholly occupied with the argument,\r\nand regarding the retreat of his opponent as an acknowledgment of defeat,\r\nstill pressed his point, and even hollowed \"more last words\" through the\r\ncoach-window after Sheridan, who, walking quietly home, left the poor\r\ndisputant responsible for the heavy fare of the coach.] nor a softer\r\nenemy to soothe one into an oblivion of them.\r\n\r\n\"It is damned foolish for ladies to leave their scissors about;--the\r\nfrail thread of a worthless life is soon snipped. I wish to God my fate\r\nhad been true to its first destination, and made a parson of me;--I\r\nshould have made an excellent country Joll. I think I can, with\r\nconfidence, pronounce the character that would have been given of me:--He\r\nwas an indolent good-humored man, civil at all times, and hospitable at\r\nothers, namely, when he was able to be so, which, truth to say, happened\r\nbut seldom. His sermons were better than his preaching, and his doctrine\r\nbetter than his life; though often grave, and sometimes melancholy, he\r\nnevertheless loved a joke,--the more so when overtaken in his cups,\r\nwhich, a regard to the faith of history compels us to subjoin, fell out\r\nnot unfrequently. He had more thought than was generally imputed to him,\r\nthough it must be owned no man alive ever exercised thought to so little\r\npurpose. Rebecca, his wife, the daughter of an opulent farmer in the\r\nneighborhood of his small living, brought him eighteen children; and he\r\nnow rests with those who, being rather _not_ absolutely vicious than\r\nactively good, confide in the bounty of Providence to strike a mild\r\naverage between the contending negations of their life, and to allow them\r\nin their future state, what he ordained them in this earthly pilgrimage,\r\na snug neutrality and a useless repose.--I had written thus far,\r\nabsolutely determined, under an irresistible influence of the megrims, to\r\nset off for London on foot, when, accidentally searching for a\r\ncardialgic, to my great delight, I discovered three fugitive sixpences,\r\nheaded by a vagrant shilling, immerged in the heap in my waistcoat\r\npocket. This discovery gave an immediate elasticity to my mind; and I\r\nhave therefore devised a scheme, worthier the improved state of my\r\nspirits, namely, to swindle your servants out of a horse, under the\r\npretence of a ride upon the heath, and to jog on contentedly homewards.\r\nSo, under the protection of Providence, and the mercy of footpads, I\r\ntrust we shall meet again to-morrow; at all events, there is nothing\r\nhuffish in this; for, whether sad or merry, I am always,\r\n\r\n\"Most affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n\"J. RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\n\"P.S. Your return only confirmed me in my resolution of going; for I had\r\nworked myself, in five hours solitude, into such a state of nervous\r\nmelancholy, that I found I could not help the meanness of crying, even if\r\nany one looked me in the face. I am anxious to avoid a regular conviction\r\nof so disreputable an infirmity;--besides, the night has become quite\r\npleasant.\"\r\n\r\nBetween Tickell and Sheridan there was a never-ending \"skirmish of wit,\"\r\nboth verbal and practical; and the latter kind, in particular, was\r\ncarried on between them with all the waggery, and, not unfrequently, the\r\nmalice of school-boys. [Footnote: On one occasion, Sheridan having\r\ncovered the floor of a dark passage, leading from the drawing room, with\r\nall the plates and dishes of the house, ranged closely together, provoked\r\nhis unconscious play-fellow to pursue him into the midst of them. Having\r\nleft a path for his own escape, he passed through easily, but Tickell,\r\nfalling at full length into the ambuscade, was very much cut in several\r\nplaces. The next day, Lord John Townshend, on paying a visit to the\r\nbed-side of Tickell, found him covered over with patches, and indignantly\r\nvowing vengeance against Sheridan for this unjustifiable trick. In the\r\nmidst of his anger, however, he could not help exclaiming, with the true\r\nfeeling of an amateur of this sort of mischief, \"but how amazingly well\r\ndone it was!\"] Tickell, much less occupied by business than his friend,\r\nhad always some political _jeux d'esprit_ on the anvil; and\r\nsometimes these trifles were produced by them jointly. The following\r\nstring of pasquinades so well known in political circles, and written, as\r\nthe reader will perceive, at different dates, though principally by\r\nSheridan, owes some of its stanzas to Tickel, and a few others, I\r\nbelieve, to Lord John Townshend. I have strung together, without regard\r\nto chronology, the best of these detached lampoons. Time having removed\r\ntheir venom, and with it, in a great degree, their wit, they are now,\r\nlike dried snakes, mere harmless objects of curiosity.\r\n\r\n    \"Johnny W--lks, Johnny W--lks, [1]\r\n    Thou greatest of bilks,\r\n  How chang'd are the notes you now sing!\r\n    Your fam'd Forty-five\r\n    Is Prerogative,\r\n  And your blasphemy, 'God save the King,'\r\n    Johnny W-lks,\r\n  And your blasphemy, 'God save the King.'\"\r\n\r\n    \"Jack Ch--ch--ll, Jack Ch--ch--ll,\r\n    The town sure you search ill,\r\n  Your mob has disgraced all your brags;\r\n    When next you draw out\r\n    Your hospital rout,\r\n  Do, prithee, afford them clean rags,\r\n    Jack Ch--ch--ll,\r\n  Do, prithee, afford them clean rags.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Captain K--th, Captain K--th,\r\n    Keep your tongue 'twixt your teeth,\r\n  Lest bed-chamber tricks you betray;\r\n    And, if teeth you want more,\r\n    Why, my bold Commodore,--\r\n  You may borrow of Lord G--ll--y,\r\n    Captain K--th,\r\n  You may borrow of Lord G--ll--y.\"\r\n\r\n    [2]\"Joe M--wb--y, Joe M--wb--y,\r\n    Your throat sure must raw be,\r\n  In striving to make yourself heard;\r\n    But it pleased not the pigs.\r\n    Nor the Westminster Whigs,\r\n  That your Knighthood should utter one word,\r\n    Joe M--wb--y,\r\n  That your Knighthood should utter one word.\"\r\n\r\n    \"M--ntm--res, M--ntm--res,\r\n    Whom nobody for is,\r\n  And _for_ whom we none of us care;\r\n    From Dublin you came--\r\n    It had much been the same\r\n  If your Lordship had staid where you were,\r\n    M--ntm--res,\r\n  If your Lordship had staid where you were.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Lord O--gl--y, Lord O--gl--y,\r\n    You spoke mighty strongly--\r\n  Who you _are_, tho', all people admire!\r\n    But I'll let you depart,\r\n    For I believe in my heart,\r\n  You had rather they did not inquire,\r\n    Lord O--gl--y,\r\n  You had rather they did not inquire.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Gl--nb--e, Gl--nb--e,\r\n    What's good for the scurvy?\r\n  For ne'er be your old trade forgot--\r\n    In your arms rather quarter\r\n    A pestle and mortar,\r\n  And your crest be a spruce gallipot,\r\n    Gl--nb--e,\r\n  And your crest be a spruce gallipot.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Gl--nb--e, Gl--nb--e,\r\n    The world's topsy-turvy,\r\n  Of this truth you're the fittest attester;\r\n    For, who can deny\r\n    That the Low become High,\r\n  When the King makes a Lord of Silvester,\r\n    Gl--nb--e,\r\n  When the King makes a Lord of Silvester.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. P--l, Mr. P--l,\r\n    In return for your zeal,\r\n  I am told they have dubb'd you Sir Bob;\r\n    Having got wealth enough\r\n    By coarse Manchester stuff,\r\n  For honors you'll now drive a job,\r\n    Mr. P--l,\r\n  For honors you'll now drive a job.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Oh poor B--ks, oh poor B--ks,\r\n    Still condemned to the ranks,\r\n  Nor e'en yet from a private promoted;\r\n    Pitt ne'er will relent,\r\n    Though he knows you repent,\r\n  Having once or twice honestly voted,\r\n    Poor B--ks,\r\n  Having once or twice honestly voted.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Dull H--l--y, dull H--l--y,\r\n    Your audience feel ye\r\n  A speaker of very great weight,\r\n    And they wish you were dumb,\r\n    When, with ponderous hum,\r\n  You lengthened the drowsy debate,\r\n    Dull H--l--y,\r\n  You lengthened the drowsy debate.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In Sheridan's copy of the stanzas written by him in this\r\nmetre at the time of the Union, (beginning \"Zooks, Harry! zooks, Harry!\")\r\nhe entitled them, \"An admirable new ballad, which goes excellently well\r\nto the tune of\r\n\r\n  \"Mrs. Arne, Mrs. Arne,\r\n  It gives me concern,\" &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This stanza and, I rather think, the next were by Lord John\r\nTownshend.]\r\n\r\nThere are about as many more of these stanzas, written at different\r\nintervals, according as new victims, with good names for rhyming,\r\npresented themselves,--the metre being a most tempting medium for such\r\nlampoons. There is, indeed, appended to one of Sheridan's copies of them,\r\na long list (like a Tablet of Proscription), containing about fifteen\r\nother names marked out for the same fate; and it will be seen by the\r\nfollowing specimen that some of them had a very narrow escape:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Will C--rt--s....\"\r\n\r\n  \"V--ns--t--t, V--ns--t--t,--for little thou fit art.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Will D--nd--s, Will D--nd--s,--were you only an ass.\"\r\n\r\n  \"L--ghb--h,--thorough.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Sam H--rsl--y, Sam H--rsl--y, ... coarsely.\"\r\n\r\n  \"P--ttym--n, P--ttym--n,--speak truth, if you can.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was not alone for such lively purposes [Footnote: As I have been\r\nmentioning some instances of Sheridan's love of practical jests, I shall\r\ntake this opportunity of adding one more anecdote, which I believe is\r\npretty well known, but which I have had the advantage of hearing from the\r\nperson on whom the joke was inflicted.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. O'B---- (afterwards Bishop of ----) having arrived to dinner\r\nat Sheridan's country-house, near Osterley, where, as usual, a gay party\r\nwas collected, (consisting of General Burgoyne, Mrs. Crewe, Tickell, &c.)\r\nit was proposed that on the next day (Sunday) the Rev. Gentleman should,\r\non gaining the consent of the resident clergyman, give a specimen of his\r\ntalents as a preacher in the village church. On his objecting that he was\r\nnot provided with a sermon, his host offered to write one for him, if he\r\nwould consent to preach it; and, the offer being accepted, Sheridan left\r\nthe company early, and did not return for the remainder of the evening.\r\nThe following morning Mr. O'B---- found the manuscript by his bed-side,\r\ntied together neatly (as he described it) with riband;--the subject of\r\nthe discourse being the \"Abuse of Riches.\" Having read it over and\r\ncorrected some theological errors, (such as \"it is easier for a camel,\r\n_as Moses says_,\" &c.) he delivered the sermon in his most\r\nimpressive style, much to the delight of his own party, and to the\r\nsatisfaction, as he unsuspectingly flattered himself, of all the rest of\r\nthe congregation, among whom was Mr. Sheridan's wealthy neighbor Mr. C----\r\n\r\nSome months afterwards, however, Mr. O'B---- perceived that the family of\r\nMr. C----, with whom he had previously been intimate, treated him with\r\nmarked coldness; and, on his expressing some innocent wonder at the\r\ncircumstance, was at length informed, to his dismay, by General Burgoyne,\r\nthat the sermon which Sheridan had written for him was, throughout, a\r\npersonal attack upon Mr. C----, who had at that time rendered himself\r\nvery unpopular in the neighborhood by some harsh conduct to the poor, and\r\nto whom every one in the church, except the unconscious preacher, applied\r\nalmost every sentence of the sermon.] that Sheridan and his two friends\r\ndrew upon their joint wits; they had also but too much to do with\r\nsubjects of a far different nature)--with debts, bonds, judgments, writs,\r\nand all those other humiliating matters of fact, that bring Law and Wit\r\nso often and so unnaturally in contact. That they were serviceable to\r\neach other, in their defensive alliance against duns, is fully proved by\r\nvarious documents; and I have now before me articles of agreement, dated\r\nin 1787, by which Tickell, to avert an execution from the Theatre, bound\r\nhimself as security for Sheridan in the sum of 250_l_.,--the\r\narrears of an annuity charged upon Sheridan's moiety of the property. So\r\nsoon did those pecuniary difficulties, by which his peace and character\r\nwere afterwards undermined, begin their operations.\r\n\r\nYet even into transactions of this nature, little as they are akin to\r\nmirth, the following letter of Richardson will show that these brother\r\nwits contrived to infuse a portion of gaiety:\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SHERIDAN,\r\n\r\n\"_Essex-Street, Saturday evening._\r\n\r\n\"I had a terrible long batch with Bobby this morning, after I wrote to\r\nyou by Francois. I have so far succeeded that he has agreed to continue\r\nthe day of trial as _we_ call it (that is, in vulgar, unlearned\r\nlanguage, to put it off) from Tuesday till Saturday. He demands, as\r\npreliminaries, that Wright's bill of 500_l_. should be given up to\r\nhim, as a prosecution had been commenced against him, which, however, he\r\nhas stopped by an injunction from the Court of Chancery. This, if the\r\ntransaction be as he states it, appears reasonable enough. He insists,\r\nbesides, that the bill should undergo the most rigid examination; that\r\nyou should transmit your objections, to which he will send answers, (for\r\nthe point of a personal interview has not been yet carried,) and that the\r\nwhole amount at last, whatever it may be, should have your clear and\r\nsatisfied approbation:--nothing to be done without this--almighty honor!\r\n\r\n\"All these things being done, I desired to know what was to be the result\r\nat last:--'Surely, after having carried so many points, you will think it\r\nonly common decency to relax a little as to the time of payment? You will\r\nnot cut your pound of flesh the nearest from the merchant's heart?' To\r\nthis Bobides, 'I must have 2000_l_. put in a shape of practicable\r\nuse, and payment immediately;--for the rest I will accept security.' This\r\nwas strongly objected to by me, as Jewish in the extreme; but, however,\r\nso we parted. You will think with me, I hope, that something has been\r\ndone, however, by this meeting. It has opened an access to a favorable\r\nadjustment, and time and trust may do much. I am to see him again on\r\nMonday morning at two, so pray don't go out of town to-morrow without my\r\nseeing you. The matter is of immense consequence. I never knew till\r\nto-day that the process had been going on so long. I am convinced he\r\ncould force you to trial next Tuesday with all your infirmities green\r\nupon your head; so pray attend to it.\r\n\r\n\"_R. B. Sheridan, Esq._\r\n\r\n\"Yours ever,\r\n\r\n\"_Lower Grosvenor-Street_.\r\n\r\n\"J. RICHARDSON.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was written in the year 1792, when Sheridan's involvements\r\nhad begun to thicken around him more rapidly. There is another letter,\r\nabout the same date, still more characteristic,--where, after beginning\r\nin evident anger and distress of mind, the writer breaks off, as if\r\nirresistibly, into the old strain of playfulness and good humor.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SHERIDAN,\r\n\r\n\"_Wednesday, Essex-Street, July 30_.\r\n\r\n\"I write to you with more unpleasant feelings than I ever did in my life.\r\nWestly, after having told me for the last three weeks that nothing was\r\nwanting for my accommodation but your consent, having told me so, so late\r\nas Friday, sends me word on Monday that he would not do it at all.

I certainly mean to write\r\nsomething in the course of the summer. As a matter of business and\r\nbargain I _can_ have no higher hope about it than that you won't\r\nsuffer by it. However, if you won't take it somebody else _must_,\r\nfor no human consideration will induce me to leave any means untried,\r\nthat may rescue my family from this impending misfortune.\r\n\r\n\"For the sake of convenience you will probably give me the importance of\r\nconstruing this into an incendiary letter.

BURKE.--HIS BREACH WITH MR.\r\nSHERIDAN.--DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT.--MR. BURKE AND MR. FOX.--RUSSIAN\r\nARMAMENT.--ROYAL SCOTCH BOROUGHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the conduct and opinions of Mr. Sheridan, during\r\nthe measures and discussions consequent upon the French Revolution,--an\r\nevent, by which the minds of men throughout all Europe were thrown into a\r\nstate of such feverish excitement, that a more than usual degree of\r\ntolerance should be exercised towards the errors and extremes into which\r\nall parties were hurried during the paroxysm. There was, indeed, no rank\r\nor class of society, whose interests and passions were not deeply\r\ninvolved in the question. The powerful and the rich, both of State and\r\nChurch, must naturally have regarded with dismay the advance of a\r\npolitical heresy, whose path they saw strewed over with the broken\r\ntalismans of rank and authority. Many, too, with a disinterested\r\nreverence for ancient institutions, trembled to see them thus approached\r\nby rash hands, whose talents for ruin were sufficiently certain, but\r\nwhose powers of reconstruction were yet to be tried. On the other hand,\r\nthe easy triumph of a people over their oppressors was an example which\r\ncould not fail to excite the hopes of the many as actively as the fears\r\nof the few. The great problem of the natural rights of mankind seemed\r\nabout to be solved in a manner most flattering to the majority; the zeal\r\nof the lover of liberty was kindled into enthusiasm, by a conquest\r\nachieved for his cause upon an arena so vast; and many, who before would\r\nhave smiled at the doctrine of human perfectibility, now imagined they\r\nsaw, in what the Revolution performed and promised, almost enough to\r\nsanction the indulgence of that splendid dream. It was natural, too, that\r\nthe greater portion of that unemployed, and, as it were, homeless talent,\r\nwhich, in all great communities, is ever abroad on the wing, uncertain\r\nwhere to settle, should now swarm round the light of the new\r\nprinciples,--while all those obscure but ambitious spirits, who felt\r\ntheir aspirings clogged by the medium in which they were sunk, would as\r\nnaturally welcome such a state of political effervescence, as might\r\nenable them, like enfranchised air, to mount at once to the surface.\r\n\r\nAmidst all these various interests, imaginations, and fears, which were\r\nbrought to life by the dawn of the French Revolution, it is not\r\nsurprising that errors and excesses, both of conduct and opinion, should\r\nbe among the first products of so new and sudden a movement of the whole\r\ncivilized world;--that the friends of popular rights, presuming upon the\r\ntriumph that had been gained, should, in the ardor of pursuit, push on\r\nthe vanguard of their principles, somewhat farther than was consistent\r\nwith prudence and safety; or that, on the other side, Authority and its\r\nsupporters, alarmed by the inroads of the Revolutionary spirit, should\r\nbut the more stubbornly intrench themselves in established abuses, and\r\nmake the dangers they apprehended from liberty a pretext for assailing\r\nits very existence.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before these effects of the French Revolution began to\r\nshow themselves very strikingly in the politics of England; and,\r\nsingularly enough, the two extreme opinions, to which, as I have just\r\nremarked, that disturbing event gave rise, instead of first appearing, as\r\nmight naturally be expected, the one on the side of Government, and the\r\nother on that of the Opposition, both broke out simultaneously in the\r\nvery heart of the latter body.\r\n\r\nOn such an imagination as that of Burke, the scenes now passing in France\r\nwere every way calculated to make a most vivid impression. So susceptible\r\nwas he, indeed, of such impulses, and so much under the control of the\r\nimaginative department of his intellect, that, whatever might have been\r\nthe accidental mood of his mind, at the moment when this astounding event\r\nfirst burst upon him, it would most probably have acted as a sort of\r\nmental catalepsy, and fixed his reason in the very attitude in which it\r\nfound it. He had, however, been prepared for the part which he now took\r\nby much more deep and grounded causes. It was rather from circumstances\r\nthan from choice, or any natural affinity, that Mr. Burke had ever\r\nattached himself to the popular party in politics. There was, in truth,\r\nnothing democratic about him but his origin;--his tastes were all on the\r\nside of the splendid and the arbitrary. The chief recommendation of the\r\ncause of India to his fancy and his feeling was that it involved the fate\r\nof ancient dynasties, and invoked retribution for the downfall of thrones\r\nand princedoms, to which his imagination, always most affected by objects\r\nat a distance, lent a state and splendor that did not, in sober reality,\r\nbelong to them. Though doomed to make Whiggism his habitual haunt, he\r\ntook his perch at all times on its loftiest branches, as far as possible\r\naway from popular contact; and, upon most occasions, adopted a sort of\r\nbaronial view of liberty, as rather a question lying between the Throne\r\nand the Aristocracy, than one in which the people had a right to any\r\nefficient voice or agency. Accordingly, the question of Parliamentary\r\nReform, from the first moment of its agitation, found in him a most\r\ndecided opponent.\r\n\r\nThis inherent repugnance to popular principles became naturally\r\nheightened into impatience and disgust, by the long and fruitless warfare\r\nwhich he had waged under their banner, and the uniform ill success with\r\nwhich they had blasted all his struggles for wealth and power. Nor was he\r\nin any better temper with his associates in the cause,--having found that\r\nthe ascendancy, which he had formerly exercised over them, and which, in\r\nsome degree, consoled him for the want of official dominion, was of late\r\nconsiderably diminished, if not wholly transferred to others. Sheridan,\r\nas has been stated, was the most prominent object of his jealousy;--and\r\nit is curious to remark how much, even in feelings of this description,\r\nthe aristocratical bias of his mind betrayed itself. For, though Mr. Fox,\r\ntoo, had overtaken and even passed him in the race, assuming that station\r\nin politics which he himself had previously held, yet so paramount did\r\nthose claims of birth and connection, by which the new leader came\r\nrecommended, appear in his eyes, that he submitted to be superseded by\r\nhim, not only without a murmur, but cheerfully. To Sheridan, however, who\r\nhad no such hereditary passport to pre-eminence, he could not give way\r\nwithout heart burning and humiliation; and to be supplanted thus by a\r\nrival son of earth seemed no less a shock to his superstitious notions\r\nabout rank, than it was painful to his feelings of self-love and pride.\r\n\r\nSuch, as far as can be ascertained by a distant observer of those times,\r\nwas the temper in which the first events of the Revolution found the mind\r\nof this remarkable man;--and, powerfully as they would, at any time, have\r\nappealed to his imagination and prejudices, the state of irritability to\r\nwhich he had been wrought by the causes already enumerated peculiarly\r\npredisposed him, at this moment, to give way to such impressions without\r\nrestraint, and even to welcome as a timely relief to his pride, the\r\nmighty vent thus afforded to the \"_splendida bilis_\" with which it\r\nwas charged.\r\n\r\nThere was indeed much to animate and give a zest to the new part which he\r\nnow took. He saw those principles, to which he owed a deep grudge, for\r\nthe time and the talents he had wasted in their service, now embodied in\r\na shape so wild and alarming, as seemed to justify him, on grounds of\r\npublic safety, in turning against them the hole powers of his mind, and\r\nthus enabled him, opportunely, to dignify desertion, by throwing the\r\nsemblance of patriotism and conscientiousness round the reality of\r\ndefection and revenge. He saw the party, too, who, from the moment they\r\nhad ceased to be ruled by him, were associated only in his mind with\r\nrecollections of unpopularity and defeat, about to adopt a line of\r\npolitics which his long knowledge of the people of England, and his\r\nsagacious foresight of the consequences of the French Revolution, fully\r\nconvinced him would lead to the same barren and mortifying results. On\r\nthe contrary, the cause to which he proffered his alliance, would, he was\r\nequally sure, by arraying on its side all the rank, riches, and religion\r\nof Europe, enable him at length to feel that sense of power and triumph,\r\nfor which his domineering spirit had so long panted in vain. In this\r\nlatter hope, indeed, of a speedy triumph over Jacobinism, his\r\ntemperament, as was often the case, outran his sagacity; for, while he\r\nforesaw clearly that the dissolution of social order in France would at\r\nlast harden into a military tyranny, he appeared not to be aware that the\r\nviolent measures which he recommended against her would not only hasten\r\nthis formidable result, but bind the whole mass of the people into union\r\nand resistance during the process.\r\n\r\nLastly--To these attractions, of various kinds, with which the cause of\r\nThrones was now encircled in the eyes of Burke, must be added one, which,\r\nhowever it may still further disenchant our views of his conversion,\r\ncannot wholly be omitted among the inducements to his change,--and this\r\nwas the strong claim upon the gratitude of government, which his\r\nseasonable and powerful advocacy in a crisis so difficult established for\r\nhim, and which the narrow and embarrassed state of his circumstances\r\nrendered an object by no means of secondary importance in his views.\r\nUnfortunately,--from a delicate wish, perhaps, that the reward should\r\nnot appear to come in too close coincidence with the service,--the\r\npension bestowed upon him arrived too late to admit of his deriving much\r\nmore from it than the obloquy by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nThe consequence, as is well known, of the new course taken by Burke was\r\nthat the speeches and writings which he henceforward produced, and in\r\nwhich, as usual, his judgment was run away with by his temper, form a\r\ncomplete contrast, in spirit and tendency, to all that he had put on\r\nrecord in the former part of his life. He has, indeed, left behind him\r\ntwo separate and distinct armories of opinion, from which both Whig and\r\nTory may furnish themselves with weapons, the most splendid, if not the\r\nmost highly tempered, that ever Genius and Eloquence have condescended to\r\nbequeath to Party. He has thus too, by his own personal versatility,\r\nattained, in the world of politics, what Shakspeare, by the versatility\r\nof his characters, achieved for the world in general,--namely, such a\r\nuniversality of application to all opinions and purposes, that it would\r\nbe difficult for any statesman of any party to find himself placed in any\r\nsituation, for which he could not select some golden sentence from Burke,\r\neither to strengthen his position by reasoning or illustrate and adorn it\r\nby, fancy. While, therefore, our respect for the man himself is\r\ndiminished by this want of moral identity observable through his life and\r\nwritings, we are but the more disposed to admire that unrivalled genius,\r\nwhich could thus throw itself out in so many various directions with\r\nequal splendor and vigor. In general, political deserters lose their\r\nvalue and power in the very act, and bring little more than their treason\r\nto the new cause which they espouse:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    _\"Fortis in armis\r\n  Caesaris Labienus erat; nunc transfuga vilis.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Burke was mighty in either camp; and it would have taken _two_\r\ngreat men to effect what he, by this division of himself achieved. His\r\nmind, indeed, lies parted asunder in his works, like some vast continent\r\nsevered by a convulsion of nature,--each portion peopled by its own giant\r\nrace of opinions, differing altogether in features and language, and\r\ncommitted in eternal hostility with each other.\r\n\r\nIt was during the discussions on the Army Estimates, at the commencement\r\nof the session of 1790, that the difference between Mr. Burke and his\r\nparty in their views of the French Revolution first manifested itself.\r\nMr. Fox having taken occasion to praise the late conduct of the French\r\nGuards in refusing to obey the dictates of the Court, and having declared\r\nthat he exulted, \"both from feelings and from principles,\" in the\r\npolitical change that had been brought about in that country, Mr. Burke,\r\nin answering him, entered fully, and, it must be owned, most luminously\r\ninto the question,--expressing his apprehension, lest the example of\r\nFrance, which had, at a former period, threatened England with the\r\ncontagion of despotism, should now be the means of introducing among her\r\npeople the no less fatal taint of Democracy and Atheism. After some\r\neloquent tributes of admiration to Mr. Fox, rendered more animated,\r\nperhaps, by the consciousness that they were the last offerings thrown\r\ninto the open grave of their friendship, he proceeded to deprecate the\r\neffects which the language of his Right Honorable Friend might have, in\r\nappearing to countenance the disposition observable among \"some wicked\r\npersons\" to \"recommend an imitation of the French spirit of Reform,\" and\r\nthen added a declaration, equally remarkable for the insidious charge\r\nwhich it implied against his own party, and the notice of his approaching\r\ndesertion which it conveyed to the other,--that \"so strongly opposed was\r\nhe to any the least tendency towards the _means_ of introducing a\r\ndemocracy like that of the French, as well as to the _end_ itself,\r\nthat, much as it would afflict him, if such a thing should be attempted,\r\nand that any friend of his could concur in such measures (he was far,\r\nvery far, from believing they could), he would abandon his best friends,\r\nand join with his worst enemies to oppose either the means or the end.\"\r\n\r\nIt is pretty evident, from these words, that Burke had already made up\r\nhis mind as to the course he should pursue, and but delayed his\r\ndeclaration of a total breach, in order to prepare the minds of the\r\npublic for such an event, and, by waiting to take advantage of some\r\nmoment of provocation, make the intemperance of others responsible for\r\nhis own deliberate schism. The reply of Mr. Fox was not such as could\r\nafford this opportunity;--it was, on the contrary, full of candor and\r\nmoderation, and repelled the implied charge of being a favorer of the new\r\ndoctrines of France in the most decided, but, at the same time, most\r\nconciliatory terms.\r\n\r\n\"Did such a declaration,\" he asked, \"warrant the idea that he was a\r\nfriend to Democracy? He declared himself equally the enemy of all\r\nabsolute forms of government, whether an absolute Monarchy, an absolute\r\nAristocracy, or an absolute Democracy. He was adverse to all extremes,\r\nand a friend only to a mixed government like our own, in which, if the\r\nAristocracy, or indeed either of the three branches of the Constitution,\r\nwere destroyed, the good effect of the whole, and the happiness derived\r\nunder it would, in his mind, be at an end.\"\r\n\r\nIn returning, too, the praises bestowed upon him by his friend, he made\r\nthe following memorable and noble acknowledgment of all that he himself\r\nhad gained by their intercourse:--\r\n\r\n\"Such (he said) was his sense of the judgment of his Right Honorable\r\nFriend, such his knowledge of his principles, such the value which he set\r\nupon them, and such the estimation in which he held his friendship, that\r\nif he were to put all the political information which he had learned from\r\nbooks, all which he had gained from science, and all which any knowledge\r\nof the world and its affairs had taught him, into one scale, and the\r\nimprovement which he had derived from his Right Honorable Friend's\r\ninstruction and conversation were placed in the other, he should be at a\r\nloss to decide to which to give the preference.\"\r\n\r\nThis, from a person so rich in acquirements as Mr. Fox, was the very\r\nhighest praise,--nor, except in what related to the judgment and\r\nprinciples of his friend, was it at all exaggerated. The conversation of\r\nBurke must have been like the procession of a Roman triumph, exhibiting\r\npower and riches at every step--occasionally, perhaps, mingling the low\r\nFescennine jest with the lofty music of its march, but glittering all\r\nover with the spoils of the whole ransacked world.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke, in reply, after reiterating his praises of Mr. Fox, and the\r\nfull confidence which he felt in his moderation and sagacity, professed\r\nhimself perfectly satisfied with the explanations that had been given.\r\nThe conversation would thus have passed off without any explosion, had\r\nnot Sheridan, who was well aware that against him, in particular, the\r\ncharge of a tendency to the adoption of French principles was directed,\r\nrisen immediately after, and by a speech warmly in favor of the\r\nRevolution and of the National Assembly, at once lighted the train in the\r\nmind of Burke, and brought the question, as far as regarded themselves,\r\nto an immediate issue.\r\n\r\n\"He differed,\" he said, \"decidedly, from his Right Honorable Friend in\r\nalmost every word that be had uttered respecting the French Revolution.\r\nHe conceived it to be as just a Revolution as ours, proceeding upon as\r\nsound a principle and as just a provocation. He vehemently defended the\r\ngeneral views and conduct of the National Assembly. He could not even\r\nunderstand what was meant by the charges against them of having\r\noverturned the laws, the justice, and the revenues of their country. What\r\nwere their laws? the arbitrary mandates of capricious despotism. What\r\ntheir justice? the partial adjudications of venal magistrates. What their\r\nrevenues? national bankruptcy. This he thought the fundamental error of\r\nhis Right Honorable Friend's argument, that he accused the National\r\nAssembly of creating the evils, which they had found existing in full\r\ndeformity at the first hour of their meeting. The public creditor had\r\nbeen defrauded; the manufacturer was without employ; trade was\r\nlanguishing; famine clung upon the poor; despair on all. In this\r\nsituation, the wisdom and feelings of the nation were appealed to by the\r\ngovernment; and was it to be wondered at by Englishmen, that a people, so\r\ncircumstanced, should search for the cause and source of all their\r\ncalamities, or that they should find them in the arbitrary constitution\r\nof their government, and in the prodigal and corrupt administration of\r\ntheir revenues? For such an evil when proved, what remedy could be\r\nresorted to, but a radical amendment of the frame and fabric of the\r\nConstitution itself? This change was not the object and wish of the\r\nNational Assembly only; it was the claim and cry of all France, united as\r\none man for one purpose.\"\r\n\r\nAll this is just and unanswerable--as indeed was the greater part of the\r\nsentiments which he uttered. But he seems to have failed, even more\r\nsignally than Mr. Fox, in endeavoring to invalidate the masterly view\r\nwhich Burke had just taken of the Revolution of 1688, as compared, in its\r\nmeans and object, with that of France. There was, in truth, but little\r\nsimilarity between them,--the task of the former being to preserve\r\nliberty, that of the latter to destroy tyranny; the one being a regulated\r\nmovement of the Aristocracy against the Throne for the Nation, the other\r\na tumultuous rising of the whole Nation against both for itself.\r\n\r\nThe reply of Mr. Burke was conclusive and peremptory,--such, in short,\r\nas might be expected from a person who came prepared to take the first\r\nplausible opportunity of a rupture. He declared that \"henceforth, his\r\nHonorable Friend and he were separated in politics,\"--complained that his\r\narguments had been cruelly misrepresented, and that \"the Honorable\r\nGentleman had thought proper to charge him with being the advocate of\r\ndespotism.\" Having endeavored to defend himself from such an imputation,\r\nhe concluded by saying,--\r\n\r\n\"Was that a fair and candid mode of treating his arguments? or was it\r\nwhat he ought to have expected _in the moment of departed\r\nfriendship?_ On the contrary, was it not evident that the Honorable\r\nGentleman had made a sacrifice of his friendship, for the sake of\r\ncatching some momentary popularity? If the fact were such, even greatly\r\nas he should continue to admire the Honorable Gentleman's talents, he\r\nmust tell him that his argument was chiefly an argument _ad\r\ninvidiam_, and all the applause for which he could hope from clubs was\r\nscarcely worth the sacrifice which he had chosen to make for so\r\ninsignificant an acquisition.\"\r\n\r\nI have given the circumstances of this Debate somewhat in detail, not\r\nonly on account of its own interest and of the share which Mr. Sheridan\r\ntook in it, but from its being the first scene of that great political\r\nschism, which in the following year assumed a still more serious aspect,\r\nand by which the policy of Mr. Pitt at length acquired a predominance,\r\nnot speedily to be forgotten in the annals of this country.\r\n\r\nMr. Sheridan was much blamed for the unseasonable stimulant which, it was\r\nthought, his speech on this occasion had administered to the temper of\r\nBurke; nor can it be doubted that he had thereby, in some degree,\r\naccelerated the public burst of that feeling which had so long been\r\ntreasured up against himself But, whether hastened or delayed, such a\r\nbreach was ultimately inevitable; the divergence of the parties once\r\nbegun, it was in vain to think of restoring their parallelism. That some\r\nof their friends, however, had more sanguine hopes appears from an effort\r\nwhich was made, within two days after the occurrence of this remarkable\r\nscene, to effect a reconciliation between Burke and Sheridan. The\r\ninterview that took place on that occasion is thus described by Mr.\r\nDennis O'Brien, one of the persons chiefly instrumental in the\r\narrangements for it:--\r\n\r\n\"It appeared to the author of this pamphlet [Footnote: Entitled \"Utrum\r\nHorum.\"] that the difference between these two great men would be a great\r\nevil to the country and to their own party. Full of this persuasion he\r\nbrought them both together the second night after the original contest in\r\nthe House of Commons; and carried them to Burlington House to Mr. Fox and\r\nthe Duke of Portland, according to a previous arrangement. This\r\ninterview, which can never be forgotten by those who were present, lasted\r\nfrom ten o'clock at night until three in the morning, and afforded a very\r\nremarkable display of the extraordinary talents of the parties.\"\r\n\r\nIt will easily be believed that to the success of this conciliatory\r\neffort the temper on one side would be a greater obstacle than even the\r\nhate on both. Mr. Sheridan, as if anxious to repel from himself the\r\nsuspicion of having contributed to its failure, took an opportunity,\r\nduring his speech upon the Tobacco Act, in the month of April following,\r\nto express himself in the most friendly terms of Mr. Burke, as \"one, for\r\nwhose talents and personal virtue he had the highest esteem, veneration,\r\nand regard, and with whom he might be allowed to differ in opinion upon\r\nthe subject of France, persuaded, as he was, that they never could differ\r\nin principle.\" Of this and some other compliments of a similar nature,\r\nMr. Burke did not deign to take the slightest notice--partly, from an\r\nimplacable feeling towards him who offered them, and partly, perhaps,\r\nfrom a suspicion that they were intended rather for the ears of the\r\npublic than his own, and that, while this tendency to conciliation\r\nappeared on the surface, the under-current of feeling and influence set\r\nall the other way.\r\n\r\nAmong the measures which engaged the attention of Mr. Sheridan during\r\nthis session, the principal was a motion of his own for the repeal of the\r\nExcise Duties on Tobacco, which appears to have called forth a more than\r\nusual portion of his oratory,--his speeches on the subject occupying\r\nnearly forty pages. It is upon topics of this unpromising kind, and from\r\nthe very effort, perhaps, to dignity and enliven them, that the peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of an orator are sometimes most racily brought out. To\r\nthe Cider Tax we are indebted for one of the grandest bursts of the\r\nconstitutional spirit and eloquence of Lord Chatham; and, in these\r\norations of Sheridan upon Tobacco, we find examples of the two extreme\r\nvarieties of his dramatic talent--both of the broad, natural humor of his\r\nfarce, and the pointed, artificial wit of his comedy. For instance, in\r\nrepresenting, as one of the abuses that might arise from the\r\ndiscretionary power of remitting fines to manufacturers, the danger that\r\nthose only should feel the indulgence, who were found to be supporters of\r\nthe existing administration, [Footnote: A case of this kind formed the\r\nsubject of a spirited Speech of Mr. Windham, in 1792. See his Speeches,\r\nvol. i. p. 207.] he says:--\r\n\r\n\"Were a man whose stock had increased or diminished beyond the standard\r\ntable in the Act, to attend the Commissioners and assure them that the\r\nweather alone had caused the increase or decrease of the article, and\r\nthat no fraud whatever had been used on the occasion, the Commissioners\r\nmight say to him, 'Sir, you need not give yourself so much trouble to\r\nprove your innocence;--we see honesty in your orange cape.' But should a\r\nperson of quite a different side in politics attend for the same purpose,\r\nthe Commissioners might say, 'Sir, you are not to be believed; we see\r\nfraud in your blue and buff, and it is impossible that you should not be\r\na smuggler.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in stating the case between the manufacturers and the Minister,\r\nthe former of whom objected to the Bill altogether, while the latter\r\ndetermined to preserve its principle and only alter its form, he says:--\r\n\r\n\"The manufacturers ask the Right Honorable Gentleman, if he will consent\r\nto give up the principle? The Right Honorable Gentleman answers, 'No; the\r\nprinciple must not be abandoned, but do you inform me how I shall alter\r\nthe Bill.' This the manufacturers refused; and they wisely refused it in\r\nhis opinion; for, what was it but the Minister's saying, 'I have a yoke\r\nto put about your necks,--do you help me in fitting it on--only assist\r\nme with your knowledge of the subject, and I'll fit you with the\r\nprettiest pair of fetters that ever were seen in the world.'\"\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of his quaint and far-sought witticisms, the following\r\npassage in the same speech may vie with Trip's \"Post-Obit on the blue and\r\nsilver, &c.\"--Having described the effects of the weather in increasing\r\nor decreasing the weight of the stock, beyond the exact standard\r\nestablished in the Act, he adds,\r\n\r\n\"The Commissioners, before they could, in justice, levy such fines, ought\r\nto ascertain that the weather is always in that precise state of heat or\r\ncold which the Act supposed it would be. They ought to make Christmas\r\ngive security for frost, take a bond for hot weather from August, and\r\noblige damps and fogs to take out permits.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in one of these speeches on the Tobacco Act, that he adverted with\r\nconsiderable warmth to a rumor, which, he complained, had been\r\nmaliciously circulated, of a misunderstanding between himself and the\r\nDuke of Portland, in consequence (as the Report expresses it) of \"a\r\ncertain opposition affirmed to have been made by this Noble Duke, to some\r\nviews or expectations which he (Mr. Sheridan) was said to have\r\nentertained.\" After declaring that \"there was not in these rumors one\r\ngrain of truth,\" he added that--\r\n\r\n\"He would not venture to state to the Committee the opinion that the\r\nNoble Duke was pleased to entertain of him, lest he should be accused of\r\nvanity in publishing what he might deem highly flattering. All that he\r\nwould assert on this occasion was, that if he had it in his power to make\r\nthe man whose good opinion he should most highly prize think flatteringly\r\nof him, he would have that man think of him precisely as the Noble Duke\r\ndid, and then his wish on that subject would be most amply gratified.\"\r\n\r\nAs it is certain, that the feelings which Burke entertained towards\r\nSheridan were now in some degree shared by all those who afterwards\r\nseceded from the party, this boast of the high opinion of the Duke of\r\nPortland must be taken with what, in Heraldry, is called\r\n_Abatement_--that is, a certain degree of diminution of the\r\nemblazonry.\r\n\r\nAmong the papers of Mr. Sheridan, I find a letter addressed to him this\r\nyear by one of his most distinguished friends, relative to the motions\r\nthat had lately been brought forward for the relief of the Dissenters.\r\nThe writer, whose alarm for the interest of the Church had somewhat\r\ndisturbed his sense of liberality and justice, endeavors to impress upon\r\nMr. Sheridan, and through him upon Mr. Fox, how undeserving the\r\nDissenters were, as a political body, of the recent exertions on their\r\nbehalf, and how ungratefully they had more than once requited the\r\nservices which the Whigs had rendered them. For this latter charge there\r\nwas but too much foundation in truth, however ungenerous might be the\r\ndeduction which the writer would draw from it. It is, no doubt, natural\r\nthat large bodies of men, impatiently suffering under the ban of\r\ndisqualification, should avail themselves, without much regard to persons\r\nor party, of every aid they can muster for their cause, and should (to\r\nuse the words of an old Earl of Pembroke) \"lean on both sides of the\r\nstairs to get up.\" But, it is equally natural that the occasional\r\ndesertion and ingratitude, of which, in pursuit of this selfish policy,\r\nthey are but too likely to be guilty towards their best friends, should,\r\nif not wholly indispose the latter to their service, at least\r\nconsiderably moderate their zeal in a cause, where all parties alike seem\r\nto be considered but as instruments, and where neither personal\r\npredilections nor principle are regarded in the choice of means. To the\r\ngreat credit, however, of the Whig party, it must be said, that, though\r\noften set aside and even disowned by their clients, they have rarely\r\nsuffered their high duty, as advocates, to be relaxed or interrupted by\r\nsuch momentary suspensions of confidence. In this respect, the cause of\r\nIreland has more than once been a trial of their constancy. Even Lord\r\nNorth was able, by his reluctant concessions, to supersede them for a\r\ntime in the favor of my too believing countrymen,--whose despair of\r\nfinding justice at any hands has often led them thus to carry their\r\nconfidence to market, and to place it in the hands of the first plausible\r\nbidder. The many vicissitudes of popularity which their own illustrious\r\nWhig, Grattan, had to encounter, would have wearied out the ardor of any\r\nless magnanimous champion. But high minds are as little affected by such\r\nunworthy returns for services, as the sun is by those fogs which the\r\nearth throws up between herself and his light.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Dissenters, they had deserted Mr. Fox in his great\r\nstruggle with the Crown in 1784, and laid their interest and hopes at the\r\nfeet of the new idol of the day. Notwithstanding this, we find him, in\r\nthe year 1787, warmly maintaining, and in opposition to his rival, the\r\ncause of the very persons who had contributed to make that rival\r\ntriumphant,--and showing just so much remembrance of their late defection\r\nas served to render this sacrifice of personal to public feelings more\r\nsignal. \"He was determined,\" he said, \"to let them know that, though they\r\ncould upon some occasions lose sight of their principles of liberty, he\r\nwould not upon any occasion lose sight of his principles of toleration.\"\r\nIn the present session, too, notwithstanding that the great organ of the\r\nDissenters, Dr. Price, had lately in a sermon, published with a view to\r\nthe Test, made a pointed attack on the morals of Mr. Fox and his friends,\r\nthis generous advocate of religious liberty not the less promptly acceded\r\nto the request of the body, that he would himself bring the motion for\r\ntheir relief before the House.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of June the Parliament was dissolved,--and Mr. Sheridan again\r\nsucceeded in being elected for Stafford. The following letters, however,\r\naddressed to him by Mrs. Sheridan during the election, will prove that\r\nthey were not without some apprehensions of a different result. The\r\nletters are still more interesting, as showing how warmly alive to each\r\nother's feelings the hearts of both husband wife could remain, after the\r\nlong lapse of near twenty years, and after trials more fatal to love than\r\neven time itself.\r\n\r\n\"This letter will find you, my dear Dick. I hope, encircled with honors\r\nat Stafford. I take it for granted you entered it triumphantly on Sunday,\r\n--but I am very impatient to hear the particulars, and of the utter\r\ndiscomfiture of S---- and his followers. I received your note from\r\nBirmingham this morning, and am happy to find that you and my dear cub\r\nwere well, so far on your journey. You could not be happier than I should\r\nbe in the proposed alteration for Tom, but we will talk more of this when\r\nwe meet. I sent you Cartwright yesterday, and to-day I pack you off Perry\r\nwith the soldiers. I was obliged to give them four guineas for their\r\nexpenses. I send you, likewise, by Perry, the note from Mrs. Crewe, to\r\nenable you to speak of your qualification if you should be called upon.\r\nSo I think I have executed all your commissions, Sir; and if you want any\r\nof these doubtful votes which I mentioned to you, you will have time\r\nenough to send for them, for I would not let them go till I hear they can\r\nbe of any use.\r\n\r\n\"And, now for my journal, Sir, which I suppose you expect. Saturday, I\r\nwas at home all day busy for you,--kept Mrs. Reid to dinner,--went to the\r\nOpera,--afterwards to Mrs. St. John's, where I lost my money sadly,\r\nSir,--eat strawberries and cream for supper,--sat between Lord Salisbury\r\nand Mr. Meynell, (hope you approve of that, Sir,)--overheard Lord\r\nSalisbury advise Miss Boyle by no means to subscribe to Taylor's Opera,\r\nas O'Reilly's would certainly have the patent,--confess I did not come\r\nhome till past two. Sunday, called on Lady Julia,--father and Mr. Reid to\r\ndinner,--in the evening at Lady Hampden's,--lost my money again, Sir,\r\nand came home by one o'clock. 'Tis now near one o'clock,--my father is\r\nestablished in my boudoir, and, when I have finished this, I am going\r\nwith him to hear Abbé Vogler play on the Stafford organ. I have promised\r\nto dine with Mrs. Crewe, who is to have a female party only,--no\r\nobjection to that, I suppose. Sir? Whatever the party do, I shall do of\r\ncourse,--I suppose it will end in Mrs. Hobart's. Mr. James told me on\r\nSaturday, and I find it is the report of the day, that Bond Hopkins has\r\ngone to Stafford. I am sorry to tell you there is an opposition at York,\r\nMr. Montague opposes Sir Willam Milner. Mr. Beckford has given up at\r\nDover, and Lord ** is so provoked at it, that he has given up too, though\r\nthey say they were both sure. St. Ives is gone for want of a candidate.\r\nMr. Barham is beat at Stockbridge. Charles Lenox has offered for Surry,\r\nand they say Lord Egremont might drive him to the deuce, if he would set\r\nany body up against him. You know, I suppose, Mr. Crewe has likewise an\r\nopponent. I am sorry to tell you all this bad news, and, to complete it,\r\nMr. Adam is sick in bed, and there is nobody to do any good left in town.\r\n\r\n\"I am more than ever convinced we must look to other resources for wealth\r\nand independence, and consider politics merely as an amusement,--and in\r\nthat light 'tis best to be in Opposition, which I am afraid we are likely\r\nto be for some years again.\r\n\r\n\"I see the rumors of war still continue--Stocks continue to fall--is that\r\ngood or bad for the Ministers? The little boys are come home to me\r\nto-day. I could not help showing in my answer to Mr. T's letter, that I\r\nwas hurt at his conduct,--so I have got another flummery letter, and the\r\nboys, who (as he is pretty sure) will be the best peace-makers. God bless\r\nyou, my dear Dick. I am very well, I assure you; pray don't neglect to\r\nwrite to your ever affectionate\r\n\r\n\"E. S.\"\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAREST DICK,\r\n\r\n\"_Wednesday_.\r\n\r\n\"I am full of anxiety and fright about you.--I cannot but think your\r\nletters are very alarming. Deuce take the Corporation! is it impossible\r\nto make them resign their pretensions, and make peace with the Burgesses?\r\nI have sent Thomas after Mr. Cocker. I suppose you have sent for the\r\nout-votes; but, if they are not good, what a terrible expense will that\r\nbe!--however, they are ready. I saw Mr. Cocker yesterday,--he collected\r\nthem together last night, and gave them a treat,--so they are in high\r\ngood humor. I inclose you a letter which B. left here last night,--I\r\ncould not resist opening it. Every thing seems going wrong. I think. I\r\nthought he was not to do anything in your absence.--It strikes me the bad\r\nbusiness he mentions was entirely owing to his own stupidity, and want of\r\na little patience,--is it of much consequence? I don't hear that the\r\nreport is true of Basilico's arrival;--a messenger came to the Spanish\r\nembassy, which gave rise to this tale, I believe.\r\n\r\n\"If you were not so worried, I should scold you for the conclusion of\r\nyour letter of to-day. Might not I as well accuse you of coldness, for\r\nnot filling your letter with professions, at a time when your head must\r\nbe full of business? I think of nothing all day long, but how to do good,\r\nsome how or other, for you. I have given you a regular Journal of my\r\ntime, and all to please you,--so don't, dear Dick, lay so much stress on\r\nwords. I should use them oftener, perhaps, but I feel as if it would look\r\nlike deceit. You know me well enough, to be sure that I can never do what\r\nI'm bid, Sir,--but, pray, don't think I meant to send you a cold letter,\r\nfor indeed nothing was ever farther from my heart.\r\n\r\n\"You will see Mr. Horne Tooke's advertisement to-day in the papers;--what\r\ndo you think of that to complete the thing? Bishop Dixon has just called\r\nfrom the hustings:--he says the late Recorder. Adair, proposed Charles\r\nwith a good speech, and great applause,--Captain Berkeley, Lord Hood,\r\nwith a bad speech, not much applauded; and then Horne Tooke came forward,\r\nand, in the most impudent speech that ever was heard, proposed\r\nhimself,--abused both the candidates, and said he should have been\r\nashamed to have sat and heard such ill-deserved praises given him. But he\r\ntold the crowd that, since so many of these fine virtues and\r\nqualifications had never yet done them the least good, they might as well\r\nnow choose a candidate without them. He said, however, that if they were\r\nsincere in their professions of standing alone, he was sure of coming in,\r\nfor they must all give him their second votes. There was an amazing deal\r\nof laughing and noise in the course of his speech. Charles Fox attempted\r\nto answer him, and so did Lord Hood,--but they would hear neither, and\r\nthey are now polling away.\r\n\r\n\"Do, my dearest love, if you have possibly time, write me a few more\r\nparticulars, for your letters are very unsatisfactory, and I am full of\r\nanxiety. Make Richardson write,--what has he better to do? God bless\r\nthee, my dear, dear Dick,--would it were over and all well! I am afraid,\r\nat any rate, it will be ruinous work.\r\n\r\n\"Ever your true and affectionate\r\n\r\n\"E. S.\r\n\r\n\"_Near five_. I am just come from the hustings;--the state of the\r\npoll when I left it was, Fox, 260; Hood, 75; Home Tooke, 17! But he still\r\npersists in his determination of polling a man an hour for the whole\r\ntime--I saw Mr. Wilkes go up to vote for Tooke and Hood, amidst the\r\nhisses and groans of a multitude,\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor Dick, how you are worried! This is the day.--you will easily\r\nguess how anxious I shall be; but you seem pretty sanguine yourself,\r\nwhich is my only comfort, for Richardson's letter is rather croaking. You\r\nhave never said a word of little Monkton:--has he any chance, or none? I\r\nask questions without considering that, before you receive this, every\r\nthing will be decided--I hope triumphantly for you. What a sad set of\r\nvenal rascals your favorites the Blacks must be, to turn so suddenly from\r\ntheir professions and promises! I am half sorry you have any thing more\r\nto do with them, and more than ever regret you did not stand for\r\nWestminster with Charles, instead of Lord John;--in that case you would\r\nhave come in now, and we should not have been persecuted by this Horne\r\nTooke. However, it is the dullest contested election that ever was\r\nseen--no canvassing, no houses open, no cockades. But I heard that a\r\nreport prevails now, that Horne Tooke polling so few the two or three\r\nfirst days is an artful trick to put the others off their guard, and that\r\nhe means to pour in his votes on the last days, when it will be too late\r\nfor them to repair their neglect. But I don't think it possible, either,\r\nfor such a fellow to beat Charles in Westminster.\r\n\r\n\"I have just had a note from Reid--he is at Canterbury:--the state of the\r\npoll there, Thursday night, was as follows:--Gipps, 220; Lord * *, 211;\r\nSir T. Honeywood, 216; Mr. Warton, 163. We have got two members for\r\nWendover, and two at Ailsbury. Mr. Barham is beat at Stockbridge. Mr.\r\nTierney says he shall be beat, owing to Bate Dudley's manoeuvres, and the\r\nDissenters having all forsaken him,--a set of ungrateful wretches. E.\r\nFawkener has just sent me a state of the poll at Northampton, as it stood\r\nyesterday, when they adjourned to dinner:--Lord Compton, 160; Bouverie,\r\n98; Colonel Manners, 72. They are in hopes Mr. Manners will give up, this\r\nis all my news, Sir.\r\n\r\n\"We had a very pleasant musical party last night at Lord Erskine's, where\r\nI supped. I am asked to dine to-day with Lady Palmerston, at Sheen; but I\r\ncan't go, unless Mrs. Crewe will carry me, as the coach is gone to have\r\nits new lining. I have sent to ask her, for 'tis a fine day, and I should\r\nlike it very well. God thee bless, my dear Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Yours ever, true and affectionate,\r\n\r\n\"E.S.\r\n\r\n\"Duke of Portland has just left me:--he is full of anxiety about you:--\r\nthis is the second time he has called to inquire.\"\r\n\r\nHaving secured his own election, Mr. Sheridan now hastened to lend his\r\naid, where such a lively reinforcement was much wanted, on the hustings\r\nat Westminster. The contest here was protracted to the 2d of July; and it\r\nrequired no little exercise both of wit and temper to encounter the cool\r\npersonalities of Tooke, who had not forgotten the severe remarks of\r\nSheridan upon his pamphlet the preceding year, and who, in addition to\r\nhis strong powers of sarcasm, had all those advantages which, in such a\r\ncontest, contempt for the courtesies and compromises of party warfare\r\ngives. Among other sallies of his splenetic humor it is related, that Mr.\r\nFox having, upon one occasion, retired from the hustings, and left to\r\nSheridan the task of addressing the multitude, Tooke remarked, that such\r\nwas always the practice of quack-doctors, who, whenever they quit the\r\nstage themselves, make it a rule to leave their merry-andrews behind.\r\n[Footnote: Tooke, it is said, upon coming one Monday morning to the\r\nhustings, was thus addressed by a pietism of his opponent, not of a very\r\nreputable character--\"Well, Mr. Tooke, you will have all the blackguards\r\nwith you to day\"--\"I am delighted to hear it, Sir,\" (said Tooke, bowing,)\r\n\"and from such good authority.\"]\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution still continued, by its comet-like course, to\r\ndazzle, alarm, and disturb all Europe. Mr. Burke had published his\r\ncelebrated \"Reflections\" in the month of November, 1790; and never did\r\nany work, with the exception, perhaps, of the Eikon Basilike, produce\r\nsuch a rapid, deep, and general sensation. The Eikon was the book of a\r\nKing, and this might, in another sense, be called the Book of Kings. Not\r\nonly in England, but throughout all Europe,--in every part of which\r\nmonarchy was now trembling for its existence,--this lofty appeal to\r\nloyalty was heard and welcomed. Its effect upon the already tottering\r\nWhig party was like that of \"the Voice,\" in the ruins of Rome,\r\n\"disparting towers.\" The whole fabric of the old Rockingham confederacy\r\nshook to its base. Even some, who afterwards recovered their equilibrium,\r\nat first yielded to the eloquence of this extraordinary book,--which,\r\nlike the aera of chivalry, whose loss it deplores, mixes a grandeur with\r\nerror, and throws a charm round political superstition, that will long\r\nrender its pages a sort of region of Royal romance, to which fancy will\r\nhave recourse for illusions that have lost their last hold on reason.\r\n\r\nThe undisguised freedom with which Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan expressed\r\nevery where their opinions of this work and its principles had, of\r\ncourse, no small influence on the temper of the author, and, while it\r\nconfirmed him in his hatred and jealousy of the one, prepared him for the\r\nbreach which he meditated with the other. This breach was now, indeed,\r\ndaily expected, as a natural sequel to the rupture with Mr. Sheridan in\r\nthe last session; but, by various accidents and interpositions, the\r\ncrisis was delayed till the 6th of May, when the recommitment of the\r\nQuebec Bill,--a question upon which both orators had already taken\r\noccasion to unfold their views of the French Revolution,--furnished Burke\r\nwith an opportunity, of which he impetuously took advantage, to sever the\r\ntie between himself and Mr. Fox forever.\r\n\r\nThis scene, so singular in a public assembly, where the natural\r\naffections are but seldom called out, and where, though bursts of temper\r\nlike that of Burke are common, such tears as those shed by Mr. Fox are\r\nrare phenomena,--has been so often described in various publications,\r\nthat it would be superfluous to enter into the details of it here. The\r\nfollowing are the solemn and stern words in which sentence of death was\r\npronounced upon a friendship, that had now lasted for more than the\r\nfourth part of a century. \"It certainly,\" said Mr. Burke, \"was\r\nindiscretion at any period, but especially at his time of life, to\r\nprovoke enemies, or to give his friends occasion to desert him; yet, if\r\nhis firm and steady adherence to the British Constitution placed him in\r\nsuch a dilemma, he would risk all, and, as public duty and public\r\nprudence taught him, with his last words exclaim, 'Fly from the French\r\nConstitution.'\" [Mr. Fox here whispered, that \"there was no loss of\r\nfriendship.\"] Mr. Burke said, \"Yes, there _was_ a loss of\r\nfriendship;--he knew the price of his conduct;--he had done his duty at\r\nthe price of his friend; their friendship was at an end.\"\r\n\r\nIn rising to reply to the speech of Burke, Mr. Fox was so affected as to\r\nbe for some moments unable to speak:--he wept, it is said, even to\r\nsobbing; and persons who were in the gallery at the time declare, that,\r\nwhile he spoke, there was hardly a dry eye around them.\r\n\r\nHad it been possible for two natures so incapable of disguise--the one\r\nfrom simplicity and frankness, the other from ungovernable temper,--to\r\nhave continued in relations of amity, notwithstanding their disagreement\r\nupon a question which was at that moment setting the world in arms, both\r\nthemselves and the country would have been the better for such a\r\ncompromise between them. Their long habits of mutual deference would have\r\nmingled with and moderated the discussion of their present differences;\r\n--the tendency to one common centre to which their minds had been\r\naccustomed, would have prevented them from flying so very widely asunder;\r\nand both might have been thus saved from those extremes of principle,\r\nwhich Mr. Burke always, and Mr. Fox sometimes, had recourse to in\r\ndefending their respective opinions, and which, by lighting, as it were,\r\nthe torch at both ends, but hastened a conflagration in which Liberty\r\nherself might have been the sufferer. But it was evident that such a\r\ncompromise would have been wholly impossible. Even granting that Mr.\r\nBurke did not welcome the schism as a relief, neither the temper of the\r\nmen nor the spirit of the times, which converted opinions at once into\r\npassions, would have admitted of such a peaceable counterbalance of\r\nprinciples, nor suffered them long to slumber in that hollow truce, which\r\nTacitus has described,--\"_manente in speciem amicitia_\" Mr.\r\nSheridan saw this from the first; and, in hazarding that vehement speech,\r\nby which he provoked the rupture between himself and Burke, neither his\r\njudgment nor his temper were so much off their guard as they who blamed\r\nthat speech seemed inclined to infer. But, perceiving that a separation\r\nwas in the end inevitable, he thought it safer, perhaps, as well as\r\nmanlier, to encounter the extremity at once, than by any temporizing\r\ndelay, or too complaisant suppression of opinion, to involve both himself\r\nand Mr. Fox in the suspicion of either sharing or countenancing that\r\nspirit of defection, which, he saw, was fast spreading among the rest of\r\ntheir associates.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed said, and with every appearance of truth, that Mr. Sheridan\r\nhad felt offended by the censures which some of his political friends had\r\npronounced upon the indiscretion (as it was called) of his speech in the\r\nlast year, and that, having, in consequence, withdrawn from them the aid\r\nof his powerful talents during a great part of the present session, he\r\nbut returned to his post under the express condition, that he should be\r\nallowed to take the earliest opportunity of repeating, fully and\r\nexplicitly, the same avowal of his sentiments.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Dr. Parr to Mrs. Sheridan, written immediately\r\nafter the scene between Burke and Sheridan in the preceding year, is\r\ncurious:--\r\n\r\n\"DEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n\"I am most fixedly and most indignantly on the side of Mr. Sheridan and\r\nMr. Fox against Mr. Burke. It is not merely French politics that produced\r\nthis dispute;--they might have been settled privately. No, no,--there is\r\njealousy lurking underneath;--jealousy of Mr. Sheridan's eloquence;\r\n--jealousy of his popularity;--jealousy of his influence with Mr.\r\nFox;--jealousy, perhaps, of his connection with the Prince.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sheridan was, I think, not too warm; or, at least, I should have\r\nmyself been warmer. Why, Burke accused Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan of acts\r\nleading to rebellion,--and he made Mr. Fox a dupe, and Mr. Sheridan a\r\ntraitor! I think _this_,--and I am sure, yes, positively sure, that\r\nnothing else will allay the ferment of men's minds. Mr. Sheridan ought,\r\npublicly in Parliament, to demand proof, or a retractation, of this\r\nhorrible charge. Pitt's words never did the party half the hurt;--and,\r\njust on the eve of an election, it is worse. As to private bickerings, or\r\nprivate concessions and reconciliations, they are all nothing. In public\r\nall must be again taken up; for, if drowned, the Public will say, and\r\nPitt will insinuate, that the charge is well founded, and that they dare\r\nnot provoke an inquiry.\r\n\r\n\"I know Burke is not addicted to giving up,--and so much the worse for\r\nhim and his party. As to Mr. Fox's yielding, well had it been for all,\r\nall, all the party, if Mr. Fox had, now and then, stood out against Mr.\r\nBurke. The ferment and alarm are universal, and something must be done;\r\nfor it is a conflagration in which they must perish, unless it be\r\nstopped. All the papers are with Burke,--even the Foxite papers, which I\r\nhave seen. I know his violence, and temper, and obstinacy of opinion,\r\nand--but I will not speak out, for, though I think him the greatest man\r\nupon the earth, yet, in politics I think him,--what he has been found, to\r\nthe sorrow of those who act with him. He is uncorrupt, I know; but his\r\npassions are quite headstrong; [Footnote: It was well said, (I believe,\r\nby Mr. Fox,) that it was lucky both for Burke and Windham that they took\r\nthe Royal side on the subject of the French Revolution, as they would\r\nhave got hanged on the other.] and age, and disappointment, and the sight\r\nof other men rising into fame and consequence, sour him. Pray tell me\r\nwhen they are reconciled,--though, as I said, it is nothing to the\r\npurpose without a public explanation.\r\n\r\n\"I am, dear Madam,\r\n\r\n\"Yours truly,\r\n\r\n\"S. PARR.\"\r\n\r\nAnother letter, communicated to me as having been written about this\r\nperiod to Sheridan by a Gentleman, then abroad, who was well acquainted\r\nwith the whole party, contains allusions to the breach, which make its\r\nintroduction here not irrelevant:--\r\n\r\n\"I wish very much to have some account of the state of things with you\r\nthat I can rely on. I wish to know how all my old companions and\r\nfellow-laborers do; if the club yet exists; if you, and Richardson, and\r\nLord John, and Ellis, and Lawrence, and Fitzpatrick, &c., meet, and joke,\r\nand write, as of old. What is become of Becket's, and the\r\nsupper-parties,--the _noctes coenaeque_? Poor Burgoyne! I am sure\r\nyou all mourned him as I did, particularly Richardson:--pray remember me\r\naffectionately to Richardson. It is a shame for you all, and I will say\r\nungrateful in many of you, to have so totally forgotten me, and to leave\r\nme in ignorance of every thing public and private in which I am\r\ninterested. The only creature who writes to me is the Duke of Portland;\r\nbut in the great and weighty occupations that engross his mind, you can\r\neasily conceive that the little details of our Society cannot enter into\r\nHis Grace's correspondence. I have indeed carried on a pretty regular\r\ncorrespondence with young Burke. But that is now at an end. _He_ is\r\nso wrapt up in the importance of his present pursuits, that it is too\r\ngreat an honor for me to continue to correspond with him. His father I\r\never must venerate and ever love; yet I never could admire, even in him,\r\nwhat his son has inherited from him, a tenacity of opinion and a violence\r\nof _principle_, that makes him lose his friendships in his politics,\r\nand quarrel with every one who differs from him. Bitterly have I lamented\r\nthat greatest of these quarrels, and, indeed, the only important one; nor\r\ncan I conceive it to have been less afflicting to my private feelings\r\nthan fatal to the party. The worst of it to me was, that I was obliged to\r\ncondemn the man I loved, and that all the warmth of my affection, and the\r\nzeal of my partiality, could not suggest a single excuse to vindicate him\r\neither to the world or to myself, from the crime (for such it was) of\r\ngiving such a triumph to the common enemy. He failed, too, in what I most\r\nloved him for,--his heart. There it was that _Mr. Fox principally rose\r\nabove him_; nor, amiable as he ever has been, did he ever appear half\r\nso amiable as on that trying occasion.\"\r\n\r\nThe topic upon which Sheridan most distinguished himself during this\r\nSession was the meditated interference of England in the war between\r\nRussia and the Porte,--one of the few measures of Mr. Pitt on which the\r\nsense of the nation was opposed to him. So unpopular, indeed, was the\r\nArmament, proposed to be raised for this object, and so rapidly did the\r\nmajority of the Minister diminish during the discussion of it, that there\r\nappeared for some time a probability that the Whig party would be called\r\ninto power,--an event which, happening at this critical juncture, might,\r\nby altering the policy of England, have changed the destinies of all\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance to which at present this Russian question owes its chief\r\nhold upon English memories is the charge, arising out of it, brought\r\nagainst Mr. Fox of having sent Mr. Adair as his representative to\r\nPetersburg, for the purpose of frustrating the objects for which the\r\nKing's ministers were then actually negotiating. This accusation, though\r\nmore than once obliquely intimated during the discussions upon the\r\nRussian Armament in 1791, first met the public eye, in any tangible form,\r\namong those celebrated Articles of Impeachment against Mr. Fox, which\r\nwere drawn up by Burke's practised hand [Footnote: This was the third\r\ntime that his talent for impeaching was exercised, as he acknowledged\r\nhaving drawn up, during the administration of Lord North, seven distinct\r\nArticles of Impeachment against that nobleman, which, however, the advice\r\nof Lord Rockingham induced him to relinquish] in 1793, and found their\r\nway surreptitiously into print in 1797. The angry and vindictive tone of\r\nthis paper was but little calculated to inspire confidence in its\r\nstatements, and the charge again died away, unsupported and unrefuted,\r\ntill the appearance of the Memoirs of Mr. Pitt by the Bishop of\r\nWinchester; when, upon the authority of documents said to be found among\r\nthe papers of Mr. Pitt, but not produced, the accusation was\r\nrevived,--the Right Reverend biographer calling in aid of his own view of\r\nthe transaction the charitable opinion of the Turks, who, he complacently\r\nassures us, \"expressed great surprise that Mr. Fox had not lost his head\r\nfor such conduct.\" Notwithstanding, however, this _Concordat_\r\nbetween the Right Reverend Prelate and the Turks, something more is still\r\nwanting to give validity to so serious an accusation. Until the\r\nproduction of the alleged proofs (which Mr. Adair has confidently\r\ndemanded) shall have put the public in possession of more recondite\r\nmaterials for judging, they must regard as satisfactory and conclusive\r\nthe refutation of the whole charge, both as regards himself and his\r\nillustrious friend, which Mr. Adair has laid before the world; and for\r\nthe truth of which not only his own high character, but the character of\r\nthe ministries of both parties, who have since employed him in missions\r\nof the first trust and importance, seem to offer the strongest and most\r\nconvincing pledges.\r\n\r\nThe Empress of Russia, in testimony of her admiration of the eloquence of\r\nMr. Fox on this occasion, sent an order to England, through her\r\nambassador, for a bust of that statesman, which it was her intention, she\r\nsaid, to place between those of Demosthenes and Cicero. The following is\r\na literal copy of Her Imperial Majesty's note on the subject: [Footnote:\r\nFound among Mr. Sheridan's papers, with these words, in his own\r\nhand-writing, annexed:--\"N. B. Fox would have lost it, if I had not made\r\nhim look for it, and taken a copy.\"]--\r\n\r\n\"Ecrivés au Cte. Worenzof qu'il me fasse avoir en marbre blanc le Buste\r\nresemblant de Charle Fox. Je veut le mettre sur ma Colonade entre eux de\r\nDemosthene et Ciceron.\r\n\r\n\"Il a delivré par son eloquence sa Patrie et la Russie d'une guerre a la\r\nquelle il n'y avoit ni justice ni raisons.\"\r\n\r\nAnother subject that engaged much of the attention of Mr. Sheridan this\r\nyear was his own motion relative to the constitution of the Royal Scotch\r\nBoroughs. He had been, singularly enough, selected, in the year 1787, by\r\nthe Burgesses of Scotland, in preference to so many others possessing\r\nmore personal knowledge of that country, to present to the House the\r\nPetition of the Convention of Delegates, for a Reform of the internal\r\ngovernment of the Royal Boroughs. How fully satisfied they were with his\r\nexertions in their cause may be judged by the following extract from the\r\nMinutes of Convention, dated 11th August, 1791:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Mills of Perth, after a suitable introductory speech, moved a vote\r\nof thanks to Mr. Sheridan, in the following words:--\r\n\r\n\"The Delegates of the Burgesses of Scotland, associated for the purpose\r\nof Reform, taking into their most serious consideration the important\r\nservices rendered to their cause by the manly and prudent exertions of\r\nRichard Brinsley Sheridan, Esq., the genuine and fixed attachment to it\r\nwhich the whole tenor of his conduct has evinced, and the admirable\r\nmoderation he has all along displayed,\r\n\r\n\"Resolved unanimously, That the most sincere thanks of this meeting be\r\ngiven to the said Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Esq., for his steady,\r\nhonorable, and judicious conduct in bringing the question relative to the\r\nviolated rights of the Scottish Boroughs to its present important and\r\nfavorable crisis; and the Burgesses with firm confidence hope that, from\r\nhis attachment to the cause, which he has shown to be deeply rooted in\r\nprinciple, he will persevere to exert his distinguished, abilities, till\r\nthe objects of it are obtained, with that inflexible firmness, and\r\nconstitutional moderation, which have appeared so conspicuous and\r\nexemplary throughout the whole of his conduct, as to be highly deserving\r\nof the imitation of all good citizens.\r\n\r\n\"JOHN EWEN, Secretary.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a private letter written this year by one of the Scottish Delegates\r\nto a friend of Mr. Sheridan, (a copy of which letter I have found among\r\nthe papers of the latter,) it appears that the disturbing effects of Mr.\r\nBurke's book had already shown themselves so strongly among the Whig\r\nparty as to fill the writer with apprehensions of their defection, even\r\non the safe and moderate question of Scotch Reform. He mentions one\r\ndistinguished member of the party, who afterwards stood conspicuously in\r\nthe very van of the Opposition, but who at that moment, if the authority\r\nof the letter may be depended upon, was, like others, under the spell of\r\nthe great Alarmist, and yielding rapidly to the influence of that\r\nanti-revolutionary terror, which, like the Panic dignified by the\r\nancients with the name of one of their Gods, will be long associated in\r\nthe memories of Englishmen with the mighty name and genius of Burke. A\r\nconsultation was, however, held among this portion of the party, with\r\nrespect to the prudence of lending their assistance to the measure of\r\nScotch Reform; and Sir James Mackintosh, as I have heard him say, was in\r\ncompany with Sheridan, when Dr. Lawrence came direct from the meeting, to\r\ninform him that they had agreed to support his motion.\r\n\r\nThe state of the Scotch Representation is one of those cases where a\r\ndread of the ulterior objects of Reform induces many persons to oppose\r\nits first steps, however beneficial and reasonable they may deem them,\r\nrather than risk a further application of the principle, or open a breach\r\nby which a bolder spirit of innovation may enter. As it is, there is no\r\nsuch thing as popular election in Scotland. We cannot, indeed, more\r\nclearly form to ourselves a notion of the manner in which so important a\r\nportion of the British empire is represented, than by supposing the Lords\r\nof the Manor throughout England to be invested with the power of electing\r\nher representatives,--the manorial rights, too, being, in a much greater\r\nnumber of instances than at present, held independently of the land from\r\nwhich they derive their claim, and thus the natural connection between\r\nproperty and the right of election being, in most cases, wholly\r\nseparated. Such would be, as nearly as possible, a parallel to the system\r\nof representation now existing in Scotland;--a system, which it is the\r\nunderstood duty of all present and future Lord Advocates to defend, and\r\nwhich neither the lively assaults of a Sheridan nor the sounder reasoning\r\nand industry of an Abercrombie have yet been able to shake.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from another of the many letters of Dr. Parr to\r\nSheridan shows still further the feeling entertained towards Burke, even\r\nby some of those who most violently differed with him:--\r\n\r\n\"During the recess of Parliament I hope you will read the mighty work of\r\nmy friend and your friend, and Mr. Fox's friend, Mackintosh: there is\r\nsome obscurity and there are many Scotticisms in it; yet I do pronounce\r\nit the work of a most masculine and comprehensive mind. The arrangement\r\nis far more methodical than Mr. Burke's, the sentiments are more\r\npatriotic, the reasoning is more profound, and even the imagery in some\r\nplaces is scarcely less splendid. I think Mackintosh a better\r\nphilosopher, and a better citizen, and I know him to be a far better\r\nscholar and a far better man, than Payne; in whose book there are great\r\nirradiations of genius, but none of the glowing and generous warmth which\r\nvirtue inspires; that warmth which is often kindled in the bosom of\r\nMackintosh, and which pervades almost every page of Mr. Burke's\r\nbook--though I confess, and with sorrow I confess, that the holy flame\r\nwas quite extinguished in his odious altercation with you and Mr. Fox.\"\r\n\r\nA letter from the Prince of Wales to Sheridan this year furnishes a new\r\nproof of the confidence reposed in him by His Royal Highness. A question\r\nof much delicacy and importance having arisen between that Illustrious\r\nPersonage and the Duke of York, of a nature, as it appears, too urgent to\r\nwait for a reference to Mr. Fox, Sheridan had alone the honor of advising\r\nHis Royal Highness in the correspondence that took place between him and\r\nhis Royal Brother on that occasion. Though the letter affords no\r\nimmediate clue to the subject of these communications, there is little\r\ndoubt that they referred to a very important and embarrassing question,\r\nwhich is known to have been put by the Duke of York to the Heir-Apparent,\r\npreviously to his own marriage this year;--a question which involved\r\nconsiderations connected with the Succession to the Crown, and which the\r\nPrince, with the recollection of what occurred on the same subject in\r\n1787, could only get rid of by an evasive answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF MRS. SHERIDAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1792, after a long illness, which terminated in consumption,\r\nMrs. Sheridan died at Bristol, in the thirty-eighth year of her age.\r\n\r\nThere has seldom, perhaps, existed a finer combination of all those\r\nqualities that attract both eye and heart, than this accomplished and\r\nlovely person exhibited. To judge by what we hear, it was impossible to\r\nsee her without admiration, or know her without love; and a late Bishop\r\nused to say that she \"seemed to him the connecting link between woman and\r\nangel.\" [Footnote: Jackson of Exeter, too, giving a description of her,\r\nin some Memoirs of his own Life that were never published, said that to\r\nsee her, as she stood singing beside him at the piano-forte, was \"like\r\nlooking into the face of an angel.\"] The devotedness of affection, too,\r\nwith which she was regarded, not only by her own father and sisters, but\r\nby all her husband's family, showed that her fascination was of that best\r\nkind which, like charity, \"begins at home;\" and that while her beauty and\r\nmusic enchanted the world, she had charms more intrinsic and lasting for\r\nthose who came nearer to her. We have already seen with what pliant\r\nsympathy she followed her husband through his various pursuits,--\r\nidentifying herself with the politician as warmly and readily\r\nas with the author, and keeping Love still attendant on Genius through\r\nall his transformations. As the wife of the dramatist and manager, we\r\nfind her calculating the receipts of the house, assisting in the\r\nadaptation of her husband's opera, and reading over the plays sent in by\r\ndramatic candidates. As the wife of the senator and orator we see her,\r\nwith no less zeal, making extracts from state-papers, and copying out\r\nponderous pamphlets,--entering with all her heart and soul into the\r\ndetails of elections, and even endeavoring to fathom the mysteries of the\r\nFunds. The affectionate and sensible care with which she watched over,\r\nnot only her own children, but those which her beloved sister, Mrs.\r\nTickell, confided to her, in dying, gives the finish to this picture of\r\ndomestic usefulness. When it is recollected, too, that the person thus\r\nhomelily employed was gifted with every charm that could adorn and\r\ndelight society, it would be difficult, perhaps, to find any where a more\r\nperfect example of that happy mixture of utility and ornament, in which\r\nall that is prized by the husband and the lover combines, and which\r\nrenders woman what the Sacred Fire was to the Parsees,--not only an\r\nobject of adoration on their altars, but a source of warmth and comfort\r\nto their hearths.\r\n\r\nTo say that, with all this, she was not happy, nor escaped the censure of\r\nthe world, is but to assign to her that share of shadow, without which\r\nnothing bright ever existed on this earth. United not only by marriage,\r\nbut by love, to a man who was the object of universal admiration, and\r\nwhose vanity and passions too often led him to yield to the temptations\r\nby which he was surrounded, it was but natural that, in the consciousness\r\nof her own power to charm, she should be now and then piqued into an\r\nappearance of retaliation, and seem to listen with complaisance to some\r\nof those numerous worshippers, who crowd around such beautiful and\r\nunguarded shrines. Not that she was at any time unwatched by\r\nSheridan,--on the contrary, he followed her with a lover's eyes\r\nthroughout; and it was believed of both, by those who knew them best,\r\nthat, even when they seemed most attracted by other objects, they would\r\nwillingly, had they consulted the real wishes of their hearts, have given\r\nup every one in the world for each other. So wantonly do those, who have\r\nhappiness in their grasp, trifle with that rare and delicate treasure,\r\ntill, like the careless hand playing with the rose,\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"In swinging it rudely, too rudely, alas,\r\n       They snap it--it falls to ground.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had, immediately after their marriage, as we have seen, passed some\r\ntime in a little cottage at Eastburnham, and it was a period, of course,\r\nlong remembered by them both for its happiness. I have been told by a\r\nfriend of Sheridan, that he once overheard him exclaiming to himself,\r\nafter looking for some moments at his wife, with a pang, no doubt, of\r\nmelancholy self-reproach,--\"Could anything bring back those first\r\nfeelings?\" then adding with a sigh, \"Yes, perhaps, the cottage at\r\nEastburnham might.\" In this as well as in some other traits of the same\r\nkind, there is assuredly any thing but that common-place indifference,\r\nwhich too often clouds over the evening of married life. On the contrary,\r\nit seems rather the struggle of affection with its own remorse; and, like\r\nthe humorist who mourned over the extinction of his intellect so\r\neloquently as to prove that it was still in full vigor, shows love to be\r\nstill warmly alive in the very act of lamenting its death.\r\n\r\nI have already presented the reader with some letters of Mrs. Sheridan,\r\nin which the feminine character of her mind very interestingly displays\r\nitself. Their chief charm is unaffectedness, and the total absence of\r\nthat literary style, which in the present day infects even the most\r\nfamiliar correspondence. I shall here give a few more of her letters,\r\nwritten at different periods to the elder sister of Sheridan,--it being\r\none of her many merits to have kept alive between her husband and his\r\nfamily, though so far separated, a constant and cordial intercourse,\r\nwhich, unluckily, after her death, from his own indolence and the new\r\nconnections into which he entered, was suffered to die away, almost\r\nentirely. The first letter, from its allusion to the Westminster\r\nScrutiny, must have been written in the year 1784, Mr. Fox having gained\r\nhis great victory over Sir Cecil Wray on the 17th of May, and the\r\nScrutiny having been granted on the same day.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR LISSY,\r\n\r\n\"_London, June 6._\r\n\r\n\"I am happy to find by your last that our apprehensions on Charles's\r\naccount were useless. The many reports that were circulated here of his\r\naccident gave us a good deal of uneasiness; but it is no longer wonderful\r\nthat he should be buried here, when Mr. Jackman has so barbarously\r\nmurdered him with you. I fancy he would risk another broken head, rather\r\nthan give up his title to it as an officer of the Crown. We go on here\r\nwrangling as usual, but I am afraid all to no purpose. Those who are in\r\npossession of power are determined to use it without the least pretence\r\nto justice or consistency. They have ordered a Scrutiny for Westminster,\r\nin defiance of all law or precedent, and without any other hope or\r\nexpectation but that of harassing and tormenting Mr. Fox and his friends,\r\nand obliging them to waste their time and money, which perhaps they think\r\nmight otherwise be employed to a better purpose in another cause. We have\r\nnothing for it but patience and perseverance, which I hope will at last\r\nbe crowned with success, though I fear it will be a much longer trial\r\nthan we at first expected. I hear from every body that your ... are\r\nvastly disliked--but are you not all kept in awe by such beauty? I know\r\nshe flattered herself to subdue all your Volunteers by the fire of her\r\neyes only:--how astonished she must be to find that they have not yet\r\nlaid down their arms! There is nothing would tempt me to trust my sweet\r\nperson upon the water sooner than the thoughts of seeing you; but I fear\r\nmy friendship will hardly ever be put to so hard a trial. Though Sheridan\r\nis not in office, I think he is more engaged by politics than ever.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we shall not leave town till September. We have promised to\r\npay many visits, but I fear we shall be obliged to give up many of our\r\nschemes, for I take it for granted Parliament will meet again as soon as\r\npossible. We are to go to Chatsworth, and to another friend of mine in\r\nthat neighborhood, so that I doubt our being able to pay our annual visit\r\nto Crewe Hall. Mrs. Crewe has been very ill all this winter with your old\r\ncomplaint, the rheumatism--she is gone to Brightelmstone to wash it away\r\nin the sea. Do you ever see Mrs. Greville? I am glad to hear my two\r\nnephews are both in so thriving a way. Are you still a nurse? I should\r\nlike to take a peep at your bantlings. Which is the handsomest? have you\r\ncandor enough to think any thing equal to your own boy? if you have, you\r\nhave more merit than I can claim. Pray remember me kindly to Bess, Mr.\r\nL., &c., and don't forget to kiss the little squaller for me when you\r\nhave nothing better to do. God bless you.\r\n\r\n\"Ever yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"The inclosed came to Dick in one of Charles's franks; he said he should\r\nwrite to you himself with it, but I think it safest not to trust him.\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter, written in the same year, there are some touches both\r\nof sisterly and of conjugal feeling, which seem to bespeak a heart happy\r\nin all its affections.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR LISSY,\r\n\r\n_Putney, August 16._\r\n\r\n\"You will no doubt be surprised to find me still dating from this place,\r\nbut various reasons have detained me here from day to day, to the great\r\ndissatisfaction of my dear Mary, who has been expecting me hourly for the\r\nlast fortnight. I propose going to Hampton-Court tonight, if Dick returns\r\nin any decent time from town.\r\n\r\n\"I got your letter and a half the day before yesterday, and shall be very\r\nwell pleased to have such blunders occur more frequently. You mistake, if\r\nyou suppose I am a friend to your tarrers and featherers:--it is such\r\nwretches that always ruin a good cause. There is no reason on earth why\r\nyou should not have a new Parliament as well as us:--it might not,\r\nperhaps, be quite as convenient to our immaculate Minister, but I\r\nsincerely hope he will not find your Volunteers so accommodating as the\r\npresent India troops in our House of Commons. What! does the Secretary at\r\nWar condescend to reside in any house but his own?--'Tis very odd he\r\nshould turn himself out of doors in his situation. I never could perceive\r\nany economy in dragging furniture from one place to another; but, of\r\ncourse, he has more experience in these matters than I have.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Forbes dined here the other day, and I had a great deal of\r\nconversation with him on various subjects relating to you all. He says,\r\nCharles's manner of talking of his wife, &c. is so ridiculous, that,\r\nwhenever he comes into company, they always cry out,--'Now S----a, we\r\nallow you half an hour to talk of the beauties of Mrs. S.----, half an hour\r\nto your child, and another half hour to your farm,--and then we expect\r\nyou will behave like a reasonable person.'\r\n\r\n\"So Mrs. ---- is not happy: poor thing, I dare say, if the truth were\r\nknown, he teazes her to death. Your _very good_ husbands generally\r\ncontrive to make you sensible of their merit somehow or other.\r\n\r\n\"From a letter Mr. Canning has just got from Dublin, I find you have been\r\nbreaking the heads of some of our English heroes. I have no doubt in the\r\nworld that they deserved it; and if half a score more that I know had\r\nshared the same fate, it might, perhaps become less the fashion among our\r\nyoung men to be such contemptible coxcombs as they certainly are.\r\n\r\n\"My sister desired me to say all sorts of affectionate things to you, in\r\nreturn for your kind remembrance of her in your last. I assure you, you\r\nlost a great deal by not seeing her in her maternal character:--it is the\r\nprettiest sight in the world to see her with her children:--they are both\r\ncharming creatures, but my little namesake is my delight:--'tis\r\nimpossible to say how foolishly fond of her I am. Poor Mary! she is in a\r\nway to have more;--and what will become of them all is sometimes a\r\nconsideration that gives me many a painful hour. But _they_ are\r\nhappy, with _their_ little portion of the goods of this\r\nworld:--then, what are riches good for? For my part, as you know, poor\r\nDick and I have always been struggling against the stream, and shall\r\nprobably continue to do so to the end of our lives,--yet we would not\r\nchange sentiments or sensations with ... for all his estate. By the bye,\r\nI was told t'other day he was going to receive eight thousand pounds as a\r\ncompromise for his uncle's estate, which has been so long in\r\nlitigation;--is it true?--I dare say it is, though, or he would not be so\r\ndiscontented as you say he is. God bless you.--Give my love to Bess, and\r\nreturn a kiss to my nephew for me. Remember me to Mr. L. and believe me\r\n\r\n\"Truly yours.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter appears to have been written in 1785, some months\r\nafter the death of her sister, Miss Maria Linley. Her playful allusions\r\nto the fame of her own beauty might have been answered in the language of\r\nParis to Helen:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_Minor est tua gloria vero\r\n  Famaque de forma pene maligna est_.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Thy beauty far outruns even rumor's tongue,\r\n  And envious fame leaves half thy charms unsung.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR LISSY,\r\n\r\n\"_Delapre Abbey, Dec. 27._\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding your incredulity, I assure you I wrote to you from\r\nHampton-Court, very soon after Bess came to England. My letter was a\r\ndismal one; for my mind was at that time entirely occupied by the\r\naffecting circumstance of my poor sister's death. Perhaps you lost\r\nnothing by not receiving my letter, for it was not much calculated to\r\namuse you.\r\n\r\n\"I am still a recluse, you see, but I am preparing to _launch_ for\r\nthe winter in a few days. Dick was detained in town by a bad fever:--you\r\nmay suppose I was kept in ignorance of his situation, or I should not\r\nhave remained so quietly here. He came last week, and the fatigue of the\r\njourney very nearly occasioned a relapse:--but by the help of a jewel of\r\na doctor that lives in this neighborhood we are both quite stout and well\r\nagain, (for _I_ took it into my head to fall sick again, too,\r\nwithout rhyme or reason.)\r\n\r\n\"We purpose going to town to-morrow or next day. Our own house has been\r\npainting and papering, and the weather has been so unfavorable to the\r\nbusiness, that it is probable it will not be fit for us to go into this\r\nmonth; we have, therefore, accepted a most pressing invitation of General\r\nBurgoyne to take up our abode with him, till our house is ready; so your\r\nnext must be directed to Bruton-Street, under cover to Dick, unless\r\nCharles will frank it again. I don't believe what you say of Charles's\r\nnot being glad to have seen me in Dublin. You are very flattering in the\r\nreasons you give, but I rather think his vanity would have been more\r\ngratified by showing every body how much prettier and younger his wife\r\nwas than the Mrs. Sheridan in whose favor they have been prejudiced by\r\nyour good-natured partiality. If I could have persuaded myself to trust\r\nthe treacherous ocean, the pleasure of seeing you and your nursery would\r\nhave compensated for all the fame I should have lost by a comparison. But\r\nmy guardian sylph, vainer of my beauty, perhaps, than myself, would not\r\nsuffer me to destroy the flattering illusion _you_ have so often\r\ndisplayed to your Irish friends. No,--I shall stay till I am past all\r\npretensions, and then you may excuse your want of taste by saying, 'Oh,\r\nif you had seen her when she was young!'\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad that Bess is satisfied with my attention to her. The\r\nunpleasant situation I was in prevented my seeing her as often as I could\r\nwish. For _her_ sake I assure you I shall be glad to have Dick and\r\nyour father on good terms, without entering into any arguments on the\r\nsubject; but I fear, where _one_ of the parties, at least, has a\r\n_tincture_ of what they call in Latin _damnatus obstinatus\r\nmulio_, the attempt will be difficult, and the success uncertain. God\r\nbless you, and believe me\r\n\r\n\"_Mrs. Lefanu, Great Cuff-Street, Dublin_.\r\n\r\n\"Truly yours.\"\r\n\r\nThe next letter I shall give refers to the illness with which old Mr.\r\nSheridan was attacked in the beginning of the year 1788, and of which he\r\ndied in the month of August following. It is unnecessary to direct the\r\nreader's attention to the passages in which she speaks of her lost\r\nsister, Mrs. Tickell, and her children:--they have too much of the\r\nheart's best feelings in them to be passed over slightly.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR LISSY,\r\n\r\n\"_London, April 5._\r\n\r\n\"Your last letter I hope was written when you were low spirited, and\r\nconsequently inclined to forebode misfortune. I would not show it to\r\nSheridan:--he has lately been much harassed by business, and I could not\r\nbear to give him the pain I know your letter would have occasioned.\r\nPartial as your father has always been to Charles, I am confident\r\n_he_ never has, nor ever will feel half the duty and affections that\r\nDick has always exprest. I know how deeply he will be afflicted, if you\r\nconfirm the melancholy account of his declining health;--but I trust your\r\nnext will remove my apprehensions, and make it unnecessary for me to\r\nwound his affectionate heart by the intelligence. I flatter myself\r\nlikewise, that you have been without reason alarmed about poor Bess. Her\r\nlife, to be sure, must be dreadful;--but I should hope the good nature\r\nand kindness of her disposition will support her, and enable her to\r\ncontinue the painful duty so necessary, probably, to the comfort of your\r\npoor father. If Charles has not or does not do every thing in his power\r\nto contribute to the happiness of the few years which nature can allow\r\nhim, he will have more to answer to his conscience than I trust any of\r\nthose dear to me will have. Mrs. Crewe told us, the other day, she had\r\nheard from Mrs. Greville, that every thing was settled much to your\r\nfather's satisfaction. I _will_ hope, therefore, as I have said\r\nbefore, you were in a gloomy fit when you wrote, and in the mean time I\r\nwill congratulate you on the recovery of your own health and that of your\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\"I have been confined now near two months:--I caught cold almost\r\nimmediately on coming to town, which brought on all those dreadful\r\ncomplaints with which I was afflicted at Crewe-Hall. By constant\r\nattention and strict regimen I am once more got about again; but I never\r\ngo out of my house after the sun is down, and on those terms only can I\r\nenjoy tolerable health. I never knew Dick better. My dear boy is now with\r\nme for his holydays, and a charming creature he is, I assure you, in\r\nevery respect. My sweet little charge, too, promises to reward me for all\r\nmy care and anxiety. The little ones come to me every day, though they do\r\nnot at present live with me. We think of taking a house in the country\r\nthis summer as necessary for my health and convenient to S., who must be\r\noften in town. I shall then have _all_ the children with me, as they\r\nnow constitute a very great part of my happiness. The scenes of sorrow\r\nand sickness I have lately gone through have depressed my spirits, and\r\nmade me incapable of finding pleasure in the amusements which used to\r\noccupy me perhaps too much. My greatest delight is in the reflection that\r\nI am acting according to the wishes of my ever dear and lamented sister,\r\nand that by fulfilling the sacred trust bequeathed me in her last\r\nmoments, I insure my own felicity in the grateful affection of the sweet\r\ncreatures,--whom, though I love for their own sakes, I idolize when I\r\nconsider them as the dearest part of her who was the first and nearest\r\nfriend of my heart! God bless you, my dear Liss:--this is a subject that\r\nalways carries me away. I will therefore bid you adieu,--only entreating\r\nyou as soon as you can to send me a more comfortable letter. My kind love\r\nto Bess, and Mr. L.\r\n\r\n\"Yours, ever affectionately.\"\r\n\r\nI shall give but one more letter; which is perhaps only interesting as\r\nshowing how little her heart went along with the gayeties into which her\r\nhusband's connection with the world of fashion and politics led her.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR LISSY,\r\n\r\n\"_May 23._\r\n\r\n\"I have only time at present to write a few lines at the request of Mrs.\r\nCrewe, who is made very unhappy by an account of Mrs. Greville's illness,\r\nas she thinks it possible Mrs. G. has not confessed the whole of her\r\nsituation. She earnestly wishes you would find out from Dr. Quin what the\r\nnature of her complaint is, with every other particular you can gather on\r\nthe subject, and give me a line as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad to find your father is better. As there has been a recess\r\nlately from the Trial, I thought it best to acquaint Sheridan with his\r\nillness. I hope now, however, there is but little reason to be alarmed\r\nabout him. Mr. Tickell has just received an account from Holland, that\r\npoor Mrs. Berkeley, (whom you know best as Betty Tickell,) was at the\r\npoint of death in a consumption.\r\n\r\n\"I hope in a very short time now to get into the country. The Duke of\r\nNorfolk has lent us a house within twenty miles of London; and I am\r\nimpatient to be once more out of this noisy, dissipated town, where I do\r\nnothing that I really like, and am forced to appear pleased with every\r\nthing odious to me. God bless you. I write in the hurry of dressing for a\r\ngreat ball given by the Duke of York to night, which I had determined not\r\nto go to till late last night, when I was persuaded that it would be very\r\nimproper to refuse a Royal invitation, if I was not absolutely confined\r\nby illness. Adieu. Believe me truly yours.\r\n\r\n\"You must pay for this letter, for Dick has got your last with the\r\ndirection; and any thing in his hands is _irrecoverable_!\"\r\n\r\nThe health of Mrs. Sheridan, as we see by some of her letters, had been\r\nfor some time delicate; but it appears that her last, fatal illness\r\noriginated in a cold, which she had caught in the summer of the preceding\r\nyear. Though she continued from that time to grow gradually worse, her\r\nfriends were flattered with the hope that as soon as her confinement\r\nshould take place, she would be relieved from all that appeared most\r\ndangerous in her complaint. That event, however, produced but a temporary\r\nintermission of the malady, which returned after a few days with such\r\nincreased violence, that it became necessary for her, as a last hope, to\r\ntry the waters of Bristol.\r\n\r\nThe following affectionate letter of Tickell must have been written at\r\nthis period:--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SHERIDAN,\r\n\r\n\"I was but too well prepared for the melancholy intelligence contained in\r\nyour last letter, in answer to which, as Richardson will give you this, I\r\nleave it to his kindness to do me justice in every sincere and\r\naffectionate expression of my grief for your situation, and my entire\r\nreadiness to obey and further your wishes by every possible exertion.\r\n\r\n\"If you have any possible opportunity, let me entreat you to remember me\r\nto the dearest, tenderest friend and sister of my heart. Sustain\r\nyourself, my dear Sheridan,\r\n\r\n\"And believe me yours,\r\n\r\n\"Most affectionately and faithfully,\r\n\r\n\"R. TICKELL.\"\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of her death cannot better be told than in the language\r\nof a lady whose name it would be an honor to mention, who, giving up all\r\nother cares and duties, accompanied her dying friend to Bristol, and\r\ndevoted herself, with a tenderness rarely equalled even among women, to\r\nthe soothing and lightening of her last painful moments. From the letters\r\nwritten by this lady at the time, some extracts have lately been given by\r\nMiss Lefanu [Footnote: The talents of this young lady are another proof\r\nof the sort of _garet kind_ of genius allotted to the whole race of\r\nSheridan. I find her very earliest poetical work, \"The Sylphid Queen,\"\r\nthus spoken of in a letter from the second Mrs. Sheridan to her mother,\r\nMrs. Lefanu--\"I should have acknowledged your very welcome present\r\nimmediately, had not Mr. Sheridan, on my telling him what it was, run off\r\nwith it, and I have been in vain endeavoring to get it from him ever\r\nsince. What little I did read of it, I admired particularly, but it will\r\nbe much more gratifying to you and your daughter to hear that _he_\r\nread it with the greatest attention, and thought it showed a great deal\r\nof imagination.\"] in her interesting Memoirs of her grandmother, Mrs.\r\nFrances Sheridan. But their whole contents are so important to the\r\ncharacters of the persons concerned, and so delicately draw aside the\r\nveil from a scene of which sorrow and affection were the only witnesses,\r\nthat I feel myself justified not only in repeating what has already been\r\nquoted, but in adding a few more valuable particulars, which, by the\r\nkindness of the writer and her correspondent, I am enabled to give from\r\nthe same authentic source. The letters are addressed to Mrs. H. Lefanu,\r\nthe second sister of Mr. Sheridan.\r\n\r\n\"_Bristol, June 1, 1792._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I am happy to have it in my power to give you any information on a\r\nsubject so interesting to you, and to all that have the happiness of\r\nknowing dear Mrs. Sheridan; though I am sorry to add, it cannot be such\r\nas will relieve your anxiety, or abate your fears. The truth is, our poor\r\nfriend is in a most precarious state of health, and quite given over by\r\nthe faculty. Her physician here, who is esteemed very skilful in\r\nconsumptive cases, assured me from the first that it was a _lost\r\ncase_; but as your brother seemed unwilling to know the truth, he was\r\nnot so explicit with him, and only represented her as being in a very\r\ncritical situation. Poor man! he cannot bear to think her in danger\r\nhimself, or that any one else should; though he is as attentive and\r\nwatchful as if he expected every moment to be her last. It is impossible\r\nfor any man to behave with greater tenderness, or to feel more on such an\r\noccasion, than he does.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"At times the dear creature suffers a great deal from weakness, and want\r\nof rest. She is very patient under her sufferings, and perfectly\r\nresigned. She is well aware of her danger, and talks of dying with the\r\ngreatest composure. I am sure it will give you and Mr. Lefanu pleasure to\r\nknow that her mind is well prepared for any change that may happen, and\r\nthat she derives every comfort from religion that a sincere Christian can\r\nlook for.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of the same month Mrs. Sheridan died; and a letter from this\r\nlady, dated July 19th, thus touchingly describes her last moments. As a\r\ncompanion-picture to the close of Sheridan's own life, it completes a\r\nlesson of the transitoriness of this world, which might sadden the hearts\r\nof the beautiful and gifted, even in their most brilliant and triumphant\r\nhours. Far happier, however, in her death than he was, she had not only\r\nhis affectionate voice to soothe her to the last, but she had one devoted\r\nfriend, out of the many whom she had charmed and fascinated, to watch\r\nconsolingly over her last struggle, and satisfy her as to the fate of the\r\nbeloved objects which she left behind.\r\n\r\n\"_July 19, 1792._\r\n\r\n\"Our dear departed friend kept her bed only two days, and seemed to\r\nsuffer less during that interval than for some time before. She was\r\nperfectly in her senses to the last moment, and talked with the greatest\r\ncomposure of her approaching dissolution; assuring us all that she had\r\nthe most perfect confidence in the mercies of an all-powerful and\r\nmerciful Being, from whom alone she could have derived the inward comfort\r\nand support she felt at that awful moment! She said, she had no fear of\r\ndeath, and that all her concern arose from the thoughts of leaving so\r\nmany dear and tender ties, and of what they would suffer from her loss.\r\nHer own family were at Bath, and had spent one day with her, when she was\r\ntolerably well. Your poor brother now thought it proper to send for them,\r\nand to flatter them no longer. They immediately came;--it was the morning\r\nbefore she died. They were introduced one at a time at her bed-side, and\r\nwere prepared as much as possible for this sad scene. The women bore it\r\nvery well, but all our feelings were awakened for her poor father. The\r\ninterview between him and the dear angel was afflicting and\r\nheart-breaking to the greatest degree imaginable. I was afraid she would\r\nhave sunk under the cruel agitation:--she said it was indeed too much for\r\nher. She gave some kind injunction to each of them, and said everything\r\nshe could to comfort them under this severe trial. They then parted, in\r\nthe hope of seeing her again in the evening, but they never saw her more!\r\nMr. Sheridan and I sat up all that night with her:--indeed he had done so\r\nfor several nights before, and never left her one moment that could be\r\navoided. About four o'clock in the morning we perceived an alarming\r\nchange, and sent for her physician. [Footnote: This physician was Dr.\r\nBain, then a very young man, whose friendship with Sheridan began by this\r\nmournful duty to his wife, and only ended with the performance of the\r\nsame melancholy office for himself. As the writer of the above letters\r\nwas not present during the interview which she describes between him and\r\nMrs. Sheridan, there are a few slight errors in her account of what\r\npassed, the particulars of which, as related by Dr. Bain himself, are as\r\nfollows:--On his arrival, she begged of Sheridan and her female friend to\r\nleave the room, and then, desiring him to lock the door after them, said,\r\n\"You have never deceived me:--tell me truly, shall I live over this\r\nnight.\" Dr. Bain immediately felt her pulse, and, finding that she was\r\ndying, answered, \"I recommend you to take some laudanum;\" upon which she\r\nreplied, \"I understand you:--then give it me.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Bain fully concurs with the writer of these letters in bearing\r\ntestimony to the tenderness and affection that Sheridan evinced on this\r\noccasion:--it was, he says, quite \"the devotedness of a lover.\" The\r\nfollowing note, addressed to him after the sad event was over, does honor\r\nalike to the writer and the receiver:--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I must request your acceptance of the inclosed for your professional\r\nattendance. For the kind and friendly attentions, which have accompanied\r\nyour efforts, I must remain your debtor. The recollection of them will\r\nlive in my mind with the memory of the dear lost object, whose sufferings\r\nyou soothed, and whose heart was grateful for it.\r\n\r\n\"Believe me,\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n\"_Friday night_.\r\n\r\n\"R. B. Sheridan.\"] She said to him, 'If you can relieve me, do it\r\nquickly;--if not do not let me struggle, but give me some laudanum.' His\r\nanswer was, 'Then I will give you some laudanum.' She desired to see Tom\r\nand Betty Tickell before she took it, of whom she took a most affecting\r\nleave! Your brother behaved most wonderfully, though his heart was\r\nbreaking; and at times his feelings were so violent, that I feared he\r\nwould have been quite ungovernable at the last. Yet he summoned up\r\ncourage to kneel by the bed-side, till he felt the last pulse of expiring\r\nexcellence, and then withdrew. She died at five o'clock in the morning,\r\n28th of June.\r\n\r\n\"I hope, my dear Mrs. Lefanu, you will excuse my dwelling on this most\r\nagonizing scene. I have a melancholy pleasure in so doing, and fancy it\r\nwill not be disagreeable to you to hear all the particulars of an event\r\nso interesting, so afflicting, to all who knew the beloved creature! For\r\nmy part, I never beheld such a scene--never suffered such a\r\nconflict--much as I have suffered on my own account. While I live, the\r\nremembrance of it and the dear lost object can never be effaced from my\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\"We remained ten days after the event took place at Bristol; and on the\r\n7th instant Mr. Sheridan and Tom, accompanied by all her family (except\r\nMrs. Linley), Mr. and Mrs. Leigh, Betty Tickell and myself, attended the\r\ndear remains [Footnote: The following striking reflection, which I have\r\nfound upon a scrap of paper, in Sheridan's handwriting, was suggested, no\r\ndoubt, by his feelings on this occasion--\r\n\r\n\"The loss of the breath from a beloved object, long suffering in pain and\r\ncertainly to die, is not so great a privation as the last loss of her\r\nbeautiful remains, if they remain so. The victory of the Grave is sharper\r\nthan the Sting of Death.\"] to Wells, where we saw her laid beside her\r\nbeloved sister in the Cathedral. The choir attended; and there was such a\r\nconcourse of people of all sorts assembled on the occasion that we could\r\nhardly move along. Mr. Leigh read the service in a most affecting manner.\r\nIndeed, the whole scene, as you may easily imagine, was awful and\r\naffecting to a very great degree. Though the crowd certainly interrupted\r\nthe solemnity very much, and, perhaps, happily for us abated somewhat of\r\nour feelings, which, had we been less observed, would not have been so\r\neasily kept down.\r\n\r\n\"The day after the sad scene was closed we separated, your brother\r\nchoosing to be left by himself with Tom for a day or two. He afterwards\r\njoined us at Bath, where we spent a few days with our friends, the\r\nLeighs. Last Saturday we took leave of them, and on Sunday we arrived at\r\nIsleworth, where with much regret, I left your brother to his own\r\nmelancholy reflections, with no other companions but his two children, in\r\nwhom he seems at present entirely wrapped up. He suffered a great deal in\r\nreturning the same road, and was most dreadfully agitated on his arrival\r\nat Isleworth. His grief is deep and sincere, and I am sure will be\r\nlasting. He is in very good spirits, and at times is even cheerful, but\r\nthe moment he is left alone he feels all the anguish of sorrow and\r\nregret. The dear little girl is the greatest comfort to him:--he cannot\r\nbear to be a moment without her. She thrives amazingly, and is indeed a\r\ncharming little creature. Tom behaves with constant and tender attention\r\nto his father:--he laments his dear mother sincerely, and at the time was\r\nviolently affected;--but, at his age, the impressions of grief are not\r\nlasting; and his mind is naturally too lively and cheerful to dwell long\r\non melancholy objects. He is in all respects truly amiable and in many\r\nrespects so like his dear, charming mother, that I am sure he will be\r\never dear to my heart. I expect to have the pleasure of seeing Mr.\r\nSheridan again next week, when I hope to find him more composed than when\r\nI took leave of him last Sunday.\"\r\n\r\nTo the mention which is made, in this affecting letter, of the father of\r\nMrs. Sheridan, whose destiny it had been to follow to the grave, within a\r\nfew short years, so many of his accomplished children, [Footnote: In 1778\r\nhis eldest son Thomas was drowned, while amusing himself in a\r\npleasure-boat at the seat of the Duke of Ancaster. The pretty lines of\r\nMrs. Sheridan to his violin are well known. A few years after, Samuel, a\r\nlieutenant in the navy, was carried off by a fever. Miss Maria Linley\r\ndied in 1785, and Mrs. Tickell in 1787.\r\n\r\nI have erroneously stated, in a former part of this work, that Mr.\r\nWilliam Linley is the only surviving branch of this family;--there is\r\nanother brother, Mr. Ozias Linley, still living.] I must add a few\r\nsentences more from another letter of the same lady, which, while they\r\nincrease our interest in this amiable and ingenious man, bear testimony\r\nto Sheridan's attaching powers, and prove how affectionate he must have\r\nbeen to her who was gone, to be thus loved by the father to whom she was\r\nso dear:--\r\n\r\n\"Poor Mr. Linley has been here among us these two months. He is very much\r\nbroke, but is still a very interesting and agreeable companion. I do not\r\nknow any one more to be pitied than he is. It is evident that the\r\nrecollection of past misfortunes preys on his mind, and he has no comfort\r\nin the surviving part of his family, they being all scattered abroad. Mr.\r\nSheridan seems more his child than any one of his own, and I believe he\r\nlikes being near him and his grandchildren.\" [Footnote: In the Memoirs of\r\nMrs. Crouch I find the following anecdote:--\"Poor Mr. Linley after the\r\ndeath of one of his sons, when seated at the harpsichord in Drury-Lane\r\ntheatre, in order to accompany the vocal parts of an interesting little\r\npiece taken from Prior's Henry and Emma, by Mr. Tickell, and excellently\r\nrepresented by Paduer and Miss Farren,--when the tutor of Henry, Mr.\r\nAikin gave an impressive description of a promising young man, in\r\nspeaking of his pupil Henry, the feelings of Mr. Linley could not be\r\nsuppressed. His tears fell fast--nor did he weep alone.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same work Mrs. Crouch is made to say that, after Miss Maria Linley\r\ndied, it was melancholy for her to sing to Mr. Linley, whose tears\r\ncontinually fell on the keys as he accompanied her; and if, in the course\r\nof her profession, she was obliged to practise a song which he had been\r\naccustomed to hear his lost daughter sing, the similarity of their\r\nmanners and their voices, which he had once remarked with pleasure, then\r\naffected him to such a degree, that he was frequently forced to quit the\r\ninstrument and walk about the room to recover his composure.]\r\n\r\nTowards the autumn, (as we learn from another letter of this lady,) Mr.\r\nSheridan endeavored to form a domestic establishment for himself at\r\nWanstead.\r\n\r\n\"_Wanstead, October_ 22, 1792.\r\n\r\n\"Your brother has taken a house in this village very near me, where he\r\nmeans to place his dear little girl to be as much as possible under my\r\nprojection. This was the dying request of my beloved friend; and the last\r\neffort of her mind and pen [Footnote: There are some touching allusions\r\nto these last thoughts of Mrs. Sheridan, in an Elegy, written by her\r\nbrother, Mr. William Linley, soon after the news of the sad event reached\r\nhim in India:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Oh most beloved! my sister and my friend!\r\n  While kindred woes still breathe around thine urn,\r\n  Long with the tear of absence must _I_ blend\r\n  The sigh, that speaks thou never shall return.\r\n       *       *       *       *\r\n  \"'Twas Faith, that, bending o'er the bed of death,\r\n  Shot o'er thy pallid cheek a transient ray,\r\n  With softer effort soothed thy laboring breath,\r\n  Gave grace to anguish, beauty to decay.\r\n  \"Thy friends, thy children, claim'd thy latest care;\r\n  Theirs was the last that to thy bosom clung;\r\n  For them to heaven thou sent'st the expiring prayer,\r\n  The last that falter'd on thy trembling tongue.\"]\r\nwas made the day before she expired, to draw up a solemn promise for\r\nboth of us to sign, to ensure the strict performance of this last awful\r\ninjunction: so anxious was she to commit this dear treasure to my care,\r\nwell knowing how impossible it would be for a father, situated as your\r\nbrother is, to pay that constant attention to her which a daughter so\r\narticularly requires. * * * You may be assured I shall engage in the task\r\nwith the greatest delight and alacrity:--would to God that I were in the\r\nsmallest degree qualified to supply the place of that angelic,\r\nall-accomplished mother, of whose tender care she has been so early\r\n'deprived. All I _can_ do for her I _will_ do; and if I can\r\nsucceed so far as to give her early and steady principles of religion,\r\nand to form her mind to virtue, I shall think my time well employed, and\r\nshall feel myself happy in having fulfilled the first wish of her beloved\r\nmother's heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"To return to your brother, he talks of having his house here immediately\r\nfurnished and made ready for the reception of his nursery. It is a very\r\ngood sort of common house, with an excellent garden, roomy and fit for\r\nthe purpose, but will admit of no show or expense. I understand he has\r\ntaken a house in Jermyn-street, where he may see company, but he does not\r\nintend having any other country-house but this. Isleworth he gives up,\r\nhis time being expired there. I believe he has got a private tutor for\r\nTom--somebody very much to his mind. At one time he talked of sending\r\nhim abroad with this gentleman, but I know not at present what his\r\ndeterminations are. He is too fond of Tom's society to let him go from\r\nhim for any time; but I think it would be more to his advantage if he\r\nwould consent to part with him for two or three years. It is impossible\r\nfor any man to be more devotedly attached to his children than he is and\r\nI hope they will be a comfort and a blessing to him, when the world loses\r\nits charms. The last time I saw him, which was for about five minutes, I\r\nthought he looked remarkably well, and seemed tolerably cheerful. But I\r\nhave observed in general that this affliction has made a wonderful\r\nalteration in the expression of his countenance and in his manners.\r\n[Footnote: I have heard a Noble friend of Sheridan say that, happening\r\nabout this time to sleep in the room next to him, he could plainly hear\r\nhim sobbing throughout the greater part of the night.] The Leighs and my\r\nfamily spent a week with him at Isleworth the beginning of August, where\r\nwe were indeed most affectionately and hospitably entertained. I could\r\nhardly believe him to be the same man. In fact, we never saw him do the\r\nhonors of his house before; _that,_ you know, he always left the\r\ndear, elegant creature, who never failed to please and charm every one\r\nwho came within the sphere of her notice. Nobody could have filled her\r\nplace so well:--he seemed to have pleasure in making much of those whom\r\nshe loved, and who, he knew, sincerely loved her. We all thought he never\r\nappeared to such advantage. He was attentive to every body and every\r\nthing, though grave and thoughtful; and his feelings, poor fellow, often\r\nready to break forth in spite of his efforts to suppress them. He spent\r\nhis evenings mostly by himself. He desired me, when I wrote, to let you\r\nknow that she had by will made a little distribution of what she called\r\n'her own property,' and had left you and your sister rings of\r\nremembrance, and her _fausse montre,_ containing Mr. Sheridan's\r\npicture to you, [Footnote: This bequest is thus announced by Sheridan\r\nhimself in a letter to his sister, dated June 3, 1794:--\"I mean also to\r\nsend by Miss Patrick a picture which has long been your property, by a\r\nbequest from one whose image is not often from my mind, and whose memory,\r\nI am sure, remains in yours.\"]--Mrs. Joseph Lefanu having got hers. She\r\nleft rings also to Mr. and Mrs. Leigh, my sister, daughter, and myself,\r\nand positively forbids any others being given on any pretence, but these\r\nI have specified,--evidently precluding all her _fine friends_ from\r\nthis last mark of her esteem and approbation. She had, poor thing, with\r\nsome justice, turned from them all in disgust, and I observed, during her\r\nillness, never mentioned any of them with regard or kindness.\"\r\n\r\nThe consolation which Sheridan derived from his little daughter was not\r\nlong spared to him. In a letter, without a date, from the same amiable\r\nwriter, the following account of her death is given:--\r\n\r\n\"The circumstances attending this melancholy event were particularly\r\ndistressing. A large party of young people were assembled at your\r\nbrother's to spend a joyous evening in dancing. We were all in the height\r\nof our merriment,--he himself remarkably cheerful, and partaking of the\r\namusement, when the alarm was given that the dear little angel was dying.\r\nIt is impossible to describe the confusion and horror of the scene:--he\r\nwas quite frantic, and I knew not what to do. Happily there were present\r\nseveral kind, good-natured men, who had their recollection, and pointed\r\nout what should be done. We very soon had every possible assistance, and\r\nfor a short time we had some hope that her precious life would have been\r\nspared to us--but that was soon at an end!\r\n\r\n\"The dear babe never throve to my satisfaction:--she was small and\r\ndelicate beyond imagination, and gave very little expectation of long\r\nlife; but she had visibly declined during the last month. * * * Mr.\r\nSheridan made himself very miserable at first, from an apprehension that\r\nshe had been neglected or mismanaged; but I trust he is perfectly\r\nconvinced that this was not the case. He was severely afflicted at first.\r\nThe dear babe's resemblance to her mother after her death was so much\r\nmore striking, that it was impossible to see her without recalling every\r\ncircumstance of that afflicting scene, and he was continually in the room\r\nindulging the sad remembrance. In this manner he indulged his feelings\r\nfor four or five days; then, having indispensable business, he was\r\nobliged to go to London, from whence he returned, on Sunday, apparently\r\nin good spirits and as well as usual. But, however he may assume the\r\nappearance of ease or cheerfulness, his heart is not of a nature to be\r\nquickly reconciled to the loss of any thing he loves. He suffers deeply\r\nand secretly; and I dare say he will long and bitterly lament both mother\r\nand child.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader will, I think, feel with me, after reading the foregoing\r\nletters, as well as those of Mrs. Sheridan, given in the course of this\r\nwork, that the impression which they altogether leave on the mind is in\r\nthe highest degree favorable to the characters both of husband and wife.\r\nThere is, round the whole, an atmosphere of kindly, domestic feeling,\r\nwhich seems to answer for the soundness of the hearts that breathed in\r\nit. The sensibility, too, displayed by Sheridan at this period, was not\r\nthat sort of passionate return to former feelings, which the prospect of\r\nlosing what it once loved might awaken in even the most alienated\r\nheart;--on the contrary, there was a depth and mellowness in his sorrow\r\nwhich could proceed from long habits of affection alone. The idea,\r\nindeed, of seeking solace for the loss of the mother in the endearments\r\nof the children would occur only to one who had been accustomed to find\r\nhappiness in his home, and who therefore clung for comfort to what\r\nremained of the wreck.\r\n\r\nSuch, I have little doubt, were the natural feelings and dispositions of\r\nSheridan; and if the vanity of talent too often turned him aside from\r\ntheir influence, it is but another proof of the danger of that \"light\r\nwhich leads astray,\" and may console those who, safe under the shadow of\r\nmediocrity, are unvisited by such disturbing splendors.\r\n\r\nThe following letters on this occasion, from his eldest sister and her\r\nhusband, are a further proof of the warm attachment which he inspired in\r\nthose connected with him:--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n\"Charles has just informed me that the fatal, the dreaded event has taken\r\nplace. On my knees I implore the Almighty to look down upon you in your\r\naffliction, to strengthen your noble, your feeling heart to bear it. Oh\r\nmy beloved brother, these are sad, sad trials of fortitude. One\r\nconsolation, at least, in mitigation of your sorrow, I am sure you\r\npossess,--the consciousness of having done all you could to preserve the\r\ndear angel you have lost, and to soften the last painful days of her\r\nmortal existence. Mrs. Canning wrote to me that she was in a resigned and\r\nhappy frame of mind: she is assuredly among the blest; and I feel and I\r\nthink she looks down with benignity at my feeble efforts to soothe that\r\nanguish I participate. Let me then conjure you, my dear brother, to\r\nsuffer me to endeavor to be of use to you. Could I have done it, I should\r\nhave been with you from the time of your arrival at Bristol. The\r\nimpossibility of my going has made me miserable, and injured my health,\r\nalready in a very bad state. It would give value to my life, could I be\r\nof that service I think I _might_ be of, if I were near you; and as\r\nI cannot go to you, and as there is every reason for your quitting the\r\nscene and objects before you, perhaps you may let us have the happiness\r\nof having you here, and my dear Tom; I will write to him when my spirits\r\nare quieter. I entreat you, my dear brother, try what change of place can\r\ndo for you: your character and talents are here held in the highest\r\nestimation; and you have here some who love you beyond the affection any\r\nin England can feel for you.\r\n\r\n\"_Cuff-Street, 4th July_.\r\n\r\n\"A. LEFANU.\"\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR GOOD SIR,\r\n\r\n\"_Wednesday, 4th July, 1792._\r\n\r\n\"Permit me to join my entreaties to Lissy's to persuade you to come over\r\nto us. A journey might be of service to you, and change of objects a real\r\nrelief to your mind. We would try every thing to divert your thoughts\r\nfrom too intensely dwelling on certain recollections, which are yet too\r\nkeen and too fresh to be entertained with safety, at least to occupy you\r\ntoo entirely. Having been so long separated from your sister, you can\r\nhardly have an adequate idea of her love for you. I, who on many\r\noccasions have observed its operation, can truly and solemnly assure you\r\nthat it far exceeds any thing I could ever have supposed to have been\r\nfelt by a sister towards a brother. I am convinced you would experience\r\nsuch soothing in her company and conversation as would restore you to\r\nyourself sooner than any thing that could be imagined. Come, then, my\r\ndear Sir, and be satisfied you will add greatly to her comfort, and to\r\nthat of your very affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n\"J. LEFANU.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nDRURY-LANE THEATRE.--SOCIETY OF \"THE FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE.\"--MADAME DE\r\nGENLIS.--WAR WITH FRANCE.--WHIG SECEDERS.--SPEECHES IN PARLIAMENT.--DEATH\r\nOF TICKELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe domestic anxieties of Mr. Sheridan, during this year, left but little\r\nroom in his mind for public cares. Accordingly, we find that, after the\r\nmonth of April, he absented himself from the House of Commons altogether.\r\nIn addition to his apprehensions for the safety of Mrs. Sheridan, he had\r\nbeen for some time harassed by the derangement of his theatrical\r\nproperty, which was now fast falling into a state of arrear and\r\ninvolvement, from which it never after entirely recovered.\r\n\r\nThe Theatre of Drury-Lane having been, in the preceding year, reported by\r\nthe surveyors to be unsafe and incapable of repair, it was determined to\r\nerect an entirely new house upon the same site; for the accomplishment of\r\nwhich purpose a proposal was made, by Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Linley, to\r\nraise the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds, by the means of\r\nthree hundred debentures, of five hundred pounds each. This part of the\r\nscheme succeeded instantly; and I have now before me a list of the\r\nholders of the 300 shares, appended to the proposal of 1791, at the head\r\nof which the names of the three Trustees, on whom the Theatre was\r\nafterwards vested in the year 1793, stand for the following number of\r\nshares:--Albany Wallis, 20; Hammersley, 50; Richard Ford, 20. But, though\r\nthe money was raised without any difficulty, the completion of the new\r\nbuilding was delayed by various negotiations and obstacles, while, in the\r\nmean time, the company were playing, at an enormous expense, first in the\r\nOpera-House, and afterwards at the Haymarket-Theatre, and Mr. Sheridan\r\nand Mr. Linley were paying interest for the first instalment of the loan.\r\n\r\nTo these and other causes of the increasing embarrassments of Sheridan is\r\nto be added the extravagance of his own style of living, which became\r\nmuch more careless and profuse after death had deprived him of her, whose\r\nmaternal thoughtfulness alone would have been a check upon such\r\nimprovident waste. We are enabled to form some idea of his expensive\r\nhabits, by finding, from the letters which have just been quoted, that he\r\nwas, at the same time, maintaining three establishments,--one at\r\nWanstead, where his son resided with his tutor; another at Isleworth,\r\nwhich he still held, (as I learn from letters directed to him there,) in\r\n1793; and the third, his town-house, in Jermyn Street. Rich and ready as\r\nwere the resources which the Treasury of the theatre opened to him, and\r\nfertile as was his own invention in devising new schemes of finance, such\r\nmismanaged expenditure would exhaust even _his_ magic wealth, and\r\nthe lamp must cease to answer to the rubbing at last.\r\n\r\nThe tutor, whom he was lucky enough to obtain for his son at this time,\r\nwas Mr. William Smythe, a gentleman who has since distinguished himself\r\nby his classical attainments and graceful talent for poetry. Young\r\nSheridan had previously been under the care of Dr. Parr, with whom he\r\nresided a considerable time at Hatton; and the friendship of this learned\r\nman for the father could not have been more strongly shown than in the\r\ndisinterestedness with which he devoted himself to the education of the\r\nson. The following letter from him to Mr. Sheridan, in the May of this\r\nyear, proves the kind feeling by which he was actuated towards him:--\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I hope Tom got home safe, and found you in better spirits. He said\r\nsomething about drawing on your banker; but I do not understand the\r\nprocess, and shall not take any step. You will consult your own\r\nconvenience about these things; for my connection with you is that of\r\nfriendship and personal regard. I feel and remember slights from those I\r\nrespect, but acts of kindness I cannot forget; and, though my life has\r\nbeen passed far more in doing than receiving services, yet I know and I\r\nvalue the good dispositions of yourself and a few other friends,--men who\r\nare worthy of that name from me.\r\n\r\n\"If you choose Tom to return, he knows and you know how glad I am always\r\nto see him. If not, pray let him do something, and I will tell you what\r\nhe should do.\r\n\r\n\"Believe me, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n\"S. PARR.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of this year was established the Society of \"The Friends of\r\nthe People,\" for the express purpose of obtaining a Parliamentary Reform.\r\nTo this Association, which, less for its professed object than for the\r\nrepublican tendencies of some of its members, was particularly obnoxious\r\nto the loyalists of the day, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Grey, and many others of\r\nthe leading persons of the Whig party, belonged. Their Address to the\r\nPeople of England, which was put forth in the month of April, contained\r\nan able and temperate exposition of the grounds upon which they sought\r\nfor Reform; and the names of Sheridan, Mackintosh, Whitbread, &c., appear\r\non the list of the Committee by which this paper was drawn up.\r\n\r\nIt is a proof of the little zeal which Mr. Fox felt at this period on the\r\nsubject of Reform, that he withheld the sanction of his name from a\r\nSociety, to which so many of his most intimate political friends\r\nbelonged. Some notice was, indeed, taken in the House of this symptom of\r\nbackwardness in the cause; and Sheridan, in replying to the insinuation,\r\nsaid that \"they wanted not the signature of his Right Honorable friend to\r\nassure them I of his concurrence. They had his bond in the steadiness of\r\nhis political principles and the integrity of his heart.\" Mr. Fox\r\nhimself, however, gave a more definite explanation of the circumstance.\r\n\"He might be asked,\" he said, \"why his name was not on the list of the\r\nSociety for Reform? His reason was, that though he saw great and enormous\r\ngrievances, he did not see the remedy.\" It is to be doubted, indeed,\r\nwhether Mr. Fox ever fully admitted the principle upon which the demand\r\nfor a Reform was founded. When he afterward espoused the question so\r\nwarmly, it seems to have been merely as one of those weapons caught up in\r\nthe heat of a warfare, in which Liberty itself appeared to him too\r\nimminently endangered to admit of the consideration of any abstract\r\nprinciple, except that summary one of the right of resistance to power\r\nabused. From what has been already said, too, of the language held by\r\nSheridan on this subject, it may be concluded that, though far more ready\r\nthan his friend to inscribe Reform upon the banner of the party, he had\r\neven still less made up his mind as to the practicability or expediency\r\nof the measure. Looking upon it as a question, the agitation of which was\r\nuseful to Liberty, and at the same time counting upon the improbability\r\nof its objects being ever accomplished, he adopted at once, as we have\r\nseen, the most speculative of all the plans that had been proposed, and\r\nflattered himself that he thus secured the benefit of the general\r\nprinciple, without risking the inconvenience of any of the practical\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nThe following extract of a letter from Sheridan to one of his female\r\ncorrespondents, at this time, will show that he did not quite approve the\r\npolicy of Mr. Fox in holding aloof from the Reformers:--\r\n\r\n\"I am down here with Mrs. Canning and her family, while all my friends\r\nand party are meeting in town, where I have excused myself, to lay their\r\nwise heads together in this crisis. Again I say there is nothing but what\r\nis unpleasant before my mind. I wish to occupy and fill my thoughts with\r\npublic matters, and to do justice to the times, they afford materials\r\nenough; but nothing is in prospect to make activity pleasant, or to point\r\none's efforts against one common enemy, making all that engage in the\r\nattack cordial, social, and united. On the contrary, every day produces\r\nsome new schism and absurdity. Windham has signed a nonsensical\r\nassociation with Lord Mulgrave; and when I left town yesterday, I was\r\ninformed that the _Divan_, as the meeting at Debrett's is called,\r\nwere furious at an _authentic_ advertisement from the Duke of\r\nPortland against Charles Fox's speech in the Whig Club, which no one\r\nbefore believed to be genuine, but which they now say Dr. Lawrence\r\nbrought from Burlington-House. If this is so, depend on it there will be\r\na direct breach in what has been called the Whig Party. Charles Fox must\r\ncome to the Reformers openly and avowedly; and in a month four-fifths of\r\nthe Whig Club will do the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe motion for the Abolition of the Slave-trade, brought forward this\r\nyear by Mr. Wilberforce, (on whose brows it may be said, with much more\r\ntruth than of the Roman General, \"_Annexuit Africa lauros_,\") was\r\nsignalized by one of the most splendid orations that the lofty eloquence\r\nof Mr. Pitt ever poured forth. [Footnote: It was at the conclusion of\r\nthis speech that, in contemplating the period when Africa would, he\r\nhoped, participate in those blessings of civilization and knowledge which\r\nwere now enjoyed by more fortunate regions, he applied the happy\r\nquotation, rendered still more striking, it is said, by the circumstance\r\nof the rising sun just then shining in through the windows of the House:--\r\n\r\n  \"_Nos ... primus equis Oriens afflavit anhelis,\r\n  Illic sera rubens accendit lumina Vesper_.\"] I mention the Debate,\r\nhowever, for the mere purpose of remarking, as a singularity, that, often\r\nas this great question was discussed in Parliament, and ample as was the\r\nscope which it afforded for the grander appeals of oratory, Mr. Sheridan\r\nwas upon no occasion tempted to utter even a syllabic on the subject,--\r\nexcept once for a few minutes, in the year 1787, upon some point relating\r\nto the attendance of a witness. The two or three sentences, however, which\r\nhe did speak on that occasion were sufficient to prove, (what, as he was\r\nnot a West-India proprietor, no one can doubt,) that the sentiments\r\nentertained by him on this interesting topic were, to the full extent,\r\nthose which actuated not only his own party, but every real lover of\r\njustice and humanity throughout the world. To use a quotation which he\r\nhimself applied to another branch of the question in 1807:--\r\n\r\n  \"I would not have a slave to till my ground,\r\n  To fan me when I sleep, and tremble when\r\n  I wake, for all that human sinews, bought\r\n  And sold, have ever earn'd.\"\r\n\r\nThe National Convention having lately, in the first paroxysm of their\r\nrepublican vanity, conferred the honor of Citizenship upon several\r\ndistinguished Englishmen, and, among others, upon Mr. Wilberforce and Sir\r\nJames Mackintosh, it was intended, as appears by the following letter\r\nfrom Mr. Stone, (a gentleman subsequently brought into notice by the\r\ntrial of his brother for High Treason,) to invest Mr. Fox and Mr.\r\nSheridan with the same distinction, had not the prudent interference of\r\nMr. Stone saved them from this very questionable honor.\r\n\r\nThe following is the letter which this gentleman addressed to Sheridan on\r\nthe occasion.\r\n\r\n\"_Paris, Nov. 18, Year 1, of the French Republic._\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I have taken a liberty with your name, of which I ought to give you\r\nnotice, and offer some apology. The Convention, having lately enlarged\r\ntheir connections in Europe, are ambitious of adding to the number of\r\ntheir friends by bestowing some mark of distinction on those who have\r\nstood forth in support of their cause, when its fate hung doubtful. The\r\nFrench conceive that they owe this obligation very eminently to you and\r\nMr. Fox; and, to show their gratitude, the Committee appointed to make\r\nthe Report has determined to offer to you and Mr. Fox the honor of\r\nCitizenship. Had this honor never been conferred before, had it been\r\nconferred only on worthy members of society, or were you and Mr. Fox only\r\nto be named at this moment, I should not have interfered. But as they\r\nhave given the title to obscure and vulgar men and scoundrels, of which\r\nthey are now very much ashamed themselves, I have presumed to suppose\r\nthat you would think yourself much more honored in the breach than the\r\nobservance, and have therefore caused your nomination to be suspended.\r\nBut I was influenced in this also by other considerations, of which one\r\nwas, that, though the Committee would be more careful in their selection\r\nthan the last had been, yet it was probable you would not like to share\r\nthe honors with such as would be chosen. But another more important one\r\nthat weighed with me was, that this new character would not be a small\r\nembarrassment in the route which you have to take the next Session of\r\nParliament, when the affairs of France must necessarily be often the\r\nsubject of discussion. No one will suspect Mr. Wilberforce of being\r\nseduced, and no one has thought that he did any thing to render him\r\nliable to seduction; as his superstition and devotedness to Mr. Pitt have\r\nkept him perfectly _à l'abri_ from all temptations to err on the\r\nside of liberty, civil or religious. But to you and Mr. Fox the reproach\r\nwill constantly be made, and the blockheads and knaves in the House will\r\nalways have the means of influencing the opinions of those without, by\r\nopposing with success your English character to your French one; and that\r\nwhich is only a mark of gratitude for past services will be construed by\r\nmalignity into a bribe of some sort for services yet to be rendered. You\r\nmay be certain that, in offering the reasons for my conduct, I blush that\r\nI think it necessary to stoop to such prejudices. Of this, however, you\r\nwill be the best judge, and I should esteem it a favor if you would\r\ninform me whether I have done right, or whether I shall suffer your names\r\nto stand as they did before my interference. There will be sufficient\r\ntime for me to receive your answer, as I have prevailed on the Reporter,\r\nM. Brissot, to delay a few days. I have given him my reasons for wishing\r\nthe suspension, to which he has assented. Mr. O'Brien also prompted me to\r\nthis deed, and, if I have done wrong, he must take half the punishment.\r\nMy address is \"Rose, Huissier,\" under cover of the President of the\r\nNational Convention.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to be\r\n\r\n\"Your most obedient\r\n\r\n\"And most humble servant,\r\n\r\n\"J.H. STONE.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in the month of October of this year that the romantic adventure\r\nof Madame de Genlis, (in the contrivance of which the practical humor of\r\nSheridan may, I think, be detected,) occurred on the road between London\r\nand Dartford. This distinguished lady had, at the dose of the year 1791,\r\nwith a view of escaping the turbulent scenes then passing in France, come\r\nover with her illustrious pupil, Mademoiselle d'Orleans, and her adopted\r\ndaughter, Pamela, [Footnote: Married at Tournay in the month of December,\r\n1792, to Lord Edward Fitzgerald. Lord Edward was the only one, among the\r\nnumerous suitors of Mrs. Sheridan, to whom she is supposed to have\r\nlistened with any thing like a return of feeling; and that there should\r\nbe mutual admiration between two such noble specimens of human nature, it\r\nis easy, without injury to either of them, to believe.\r\n\r\nSome months before her death, when Sheridan had been describing to her\r\nand Lord Edward a beautiful French girl whom he had lately seen, and\r\nadded that she put him strongly in mind of what his own wife had been in\r\nthe first bloom of her youth and beauty, Mrs. Sheridan turned to Lord\r\nEdward, and said with a melancholy smile, \"I should like you, when I am\r\ndead, to marry that girl.\" This was Pamela, whom Sheridan had just seen\r\nduring his visit of a few hours to Madame de Genlis, at Bury, in Suffolk,\r\nand Whom Lord Edward married in about a year after.] to England, where\r\nshe received both from Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan, all that attention to\r\nwhich her high character for talent, as well as the embarrassing nature\r\nof her situation at that moment, claimed for her.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from her to Mr. Fox I find inclosed in one from the\r\nlatter to Mr. Sheridan:--\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"You have, by your infinite kindness, given me the right to show you the\r\nutmost confidence. The situation I am in makes me desire to have with me,\r\nduring two days, a person perfectly well instructed in the Laws, and very\r\nsure and honest. I desire such a person that I could offer to him all the\r\nmoney he would have for this trouble. But there is not a moment to be\r\nlost on the occasion. If you could send me directly this person, you\r\nwould render me the most important service. To calm the most cruel\r\nagitation of a sensible and grateful soul shall be your reward.--Oh could\r\nI see you but a minute!--I am uneasy, sick, unhappy; surrounded by the\r\nmost dreadful snares of the fraud and wickedness; I am intrusted with the\r\nmost interesting and sacred charge!--All these are my claims to hope your\r\nadvices, protection and assistance. My friends are absent in that moment;\r\nthere is only two names in which I could place my confidence and my\r\nhopes, Pardon this bad language. As Hypolite I may say,\r\n\r\n    \"'Songez que je vous parle une langue étrangère,'\r\n\r\nbut the feelings it expresses cannot be strangers to your heart.\r\n\r\n\"Sans avoir l'avantage d'être connue de Monsieur Fox, je prens la liberté\r\nde le supplier de comuniquer cette lettre à Mr. Sheridan, et si ce\r\ndernier n'est pas à Londres, j'ose espérer de Monsieur Fox la même bonté\r\nque j'attendois de Mr. Shéridan dans l'embarras où je me trouve. Je\r\nm'adresse aux deux personnes de l'Angleterre que j'admire le plus, et je\r\nserois doublement heureuse d'être tirée de cette perplexité et de leur en\r\navoir l'obligation. Je serai peut être à Londres incessament. Je\r\ndésirerois vivement les y trouver; mais en attendant je souhaite avec\r\nardeur avoir ici le plus promptement possible l'homme de loi, ou\r\nseulement en êtat de donner de bons conseils que je demande. Je\r\nrenouvelle toutes mes excuses de tant d'importunités.\"\r\n\r\nIt was on her departure for France in the present year that the\r\ncelebrated adventure to which I have alluded, occurred; and as it is not\r\noften that the post boys between London and Dartford are promoted into\r\nagents of mystery or romance, I shall give the entire narrative of the\r\nevent in the lady's own words,--premising, (what Mr. Sheridan, no doubt\r\ndiscovered,) that her imagination had been for some time on the watch for\r\nsuch incidents, as she mentions, in another place, her terrors at the\r\nidea of \"crossing the desert plains of Newmarket without an escort.\"\r\n\r\n\"We left London,\" says Madame de Genlis, \"on our return to France the\r\n20th of October, 1792, and a circumstance occurred to us so\r\nextraordinary, that I ought not, I feel, to pass it over in silence. I\r\nshall merely, however, relate the fact, without any attempt to explain\r\nit, or without adding to my recital any of those reflections which the\r\nimpartial reader will easily supply. We set out at ten o'clock in the\r\nmorning in two carriages, one with six horses, and the other, in which\r\nwere our maids, with four. I had, two months before, sent off four of my\r\nservants to Paris, so that we had with us only one French servant, and a\r\nfootman, whom we had hired to attend us as far as Dover. When we were\r\nabout a quarter of a league from London, the French servant, who had\r\nnever made the journey from Dover to London but once before, thought he\r\nperceived that we were not in the right road, and on his making the\r\nremark to me, I perceived it also. The postillions, on being questioned,\r\nsaid that they had only wished to avoid a small hill, and that they would\r\nsoon return into the high road again. After an interval of three quarters\r\nof an hour, seeing that we still continued our way through a country that\r\nwas entirely new to me, I again interrogated both the footman and the\r\npostillions, and they repeated their assurance that we should soon regain\r\nthe usual road.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding this, however, we still pursued our course with extreme\r\nrapidity, in the same unknown route; and as I had remarked that the\r\npost-boys and footman always answered me in a strange sort of laconic\r\nmanner, and appeared as if they were afraid to stop, my companions and I\r\nbegan to look at each other with a mixture of surprise and uneasiness. We\r\nrenewed our inquiries, and at last they answered that it was indeed true\r\nthey had lost their way, but that they had wished to conceal it from us\r\ntill they had found the cross-road to Dartford (our first stage,) and\r\nthat now, having been for an hour and a half in that road, we had but two\r\nmiles to go before we should reach Dartford. It appeared to us very\r\nstrange that people should lose their way between London and Dover, but\r\nthe assurance that we were only half a league from Dartford dispelled the\r\nsort of vague fear that had for a moment agitated us. At last, after\r\nnearly an hour had elapsed, seeing that we still were not arrived at the\r\nend of the stage, our uneasiness increased to a degree which amounted\r\neven to terror. It was with much difficulty that I made the post-boys\r\nstop opposite a small village which lay to our left; in spite of my\r\nshouts they still went on, till at last the French servant, (for the\r\nother did not interfere,) compelled them to stop. I then sent to the\r\nvillage to ask how far we were from Dartford, and my surprise may be\r\nguessed when I received for answer that we were now 22 miles, (more than\r\nseven leagues,) distant from that place. Concealing my suspicions, I took\r\na guide in the village, and declared that it was my wish to return to\r\nLondon, as I found I was now at a less distance from that city than from\r\nDartford. The post-boys made much resistance to my desire, and even\r\nbehaved with an extreme degree of insolence, but our French servant,\r\nbacked by the guide, compelled them to obey.\r\n\r\n\"As we returned at a very slow pace, owing to the sulkiness of the\r\npostboys and the fatigue of the horses, we did not reach London before\r\nnightfall, when I immediately drove to Mr. Sheridan's house. He was\r\nextremely surprised to see me returned, and on my relating to him our\r\nadventure, agreed with us that it could not have been the result of mere\r\nchance. He then sent for a Justice of the Peace to examine the post-boys,\r\nwho were detained till his arrival under the pretence of calculating\r\ntheir account; but in the meantime, the hired footman disappeared and\r\nnever returned. The post-boys being examined by the Justice according to\r\nthe legal form, and in the presence of witnesses, gave their answers in a\r\nvery confused way, but confessed that an unknown gentleman had come in\r\nthe morning to their masters, and carrying them from thence to a\r\npublic-house, had, by giving them something to drink, persuaded them to\r\ntake the road by which we had gone. The examination was continued for a\r\nlong time, but no further confession could be drawn from them. Mr.\r\nSheridan told me, that there was sufficient proof on which to ground an\r\naction against these men, but that it would be a tedious process, and\r\ncost a great deal of money. The post-boys were therefore dismissed, and\r\nwe did not pursue the inquiry any further. As Mr. Sheridan saw the terror\r\nI was in at the very idea of again venturing on the road to Dover, he\r\npromised to accompany us thither himself, but added that, having some\r\nindispensable business on his hands, he could not go for some days. He\r\ntook us then to Isleworth, a country-house which he had near Richmond, on\r\nthe banks of the Thames, and as he was not able to dispatch his business\r\nso quickly as he expected, we remained for a month in that hospitable\r\nretreat, which both gratitude and friendship rendered so agreeable to us.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to read this narrative, with the recollection, at the\r\nsame time, in our minds of the boyish propensity of Sheridan to what are\r\ncalled practical jokes, without strongly suspecting that he was himself\r\nthe contriver of the whole adventure. The ready attendance of the\r\nJustice,--the \"unknown gentleman\" deposed to by the post-boys,--the\r\ndisappearance of the laquais, and the advice given by Sheridan that the\r\naffair should be pursued no further,--all strongly savor of dramatic\r\ncontrivance, and must have afforded a scene not a little trying to the\r\ngravity of him who took the trouble of getting it up. With respect to his\r\nmotive, the agreeable month at his country-house sufficiently explains\r\nit; nor could his conscience have felt much scruples about an imposture,\r\nwhich, so far from being attended with any disagreeable consequences,\r\nfurnished the lady with an incident of romance, of which she was but too\r\nhappy to avail herself, and procured for him the presence of such a\r\ndistinguished party, to grace and enliven the festivities of Isleworth.\r\n[Footnote: In the Memoirs of Madame Genlis, lately published, she\r\nsupplies a still more interesting key to his motives for such a\r\ncontrivance. It appears, from the new recollections of this lady, that\r\n\"he was passionately in love with Pamela,\" and that, before her departure\r\nfrom England, the following scene took place--\"Two days before we set\r\nout, Mr. Sheridan made, in my presence, his dedication of love to Pamela,\r\nwho was affected by his agreeable manner and high character, and accepted\r\nthe offer of his hand with pleasure. In consequence of this, it was\r\nsettled that he was to marry her on our return from France, which was\r\nexpected to take place in a fortnight.\" I suspect this to be but a\r\ncontinuation of the Romance of Dartford.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the month, (adds Madame de Genlis,)\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sheridan having finished his business, we set off together for\r\nDover, himself, his son, and an English friend of his, Mr. Reid, with\r\nwhom I was but a few days acquainted. It was now near the end of the\r\nmonth of November, 1792. The wind being adverse, detained us for five\r\ndays at Dover, during all which time Mr. Sheridan remained with us. At\r\nlast the wind grew less unfavorable, but still blew so violently that\r\nnobody would advise me to embark. I resolved, however, to venture, and\r\nMr. Sheridan attended us into the very packet-boat, where I received his\r\nfarewell with a feeling of sadness which I cannot express. He would have\r\ncrossed with us, but that some indispensable duty, at that moment,\r\nrequired his presence in England. He, however, left us Mr. Reid, who had\r\nthe goodness to accompany us to Paris.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1793 war was declared between England and France. Though hostilities\r\nmight, for a short time longer, have been avoided, by a more\r\naccommodating readiness in listening to the overtures of France, and a\r\nless stately tone on the part of the English negotiator, there could\r\nhardly have existed in dispassionate minds any hope of averting the war\r\nentirely, or even of postponing it for any considerable period. Indeed,\r\nhowever rational at first might have been the expectation, that France,\r\nif left to pass through the ferment of her own Revolution, would have\r\neither settled at last into a less dangerous form of power, or exhausted\r\nherself into a state of harmlessness during the process, this hope had\r\nbeen for some time frustrated by the crusade proclaimed against her\r\nliberties by the confederated Princes of Europe. The conference at\r\nPilnitz and the Manifesto of the Duke of Brunswick had taught the French\r\npeople what they were to expect, if conquered, and had given to that\r\ninundation of energy, under which the Republic herself was sinking, a\r\nvent and direction outwards that transferred all the ruin to her enemies.\r\nIn the wild career of aggression and lawlessness, of conquest without,\r\nand anarchy within, which naturally followed such an outbreak of a whole\r\nmaddened people, it would have been difficult for England, by any\r\nmanagement whatever, to keep herself uninvolved in the general\r\ncombustion,--even had her own population been much less heartily\r\ndisposed than they were then, and ever have been, to strike in with the\r\ngreat discords of the world.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Pitt himself was slow and reluctant to yield to the necessity of\r\nhostile measures against France, appears from the whole course of his\r\nfinancial policy, down to the very close of the session of 1792. The\r\nconfidence, indeed, with which he looked forward to a long continuance of\r\npeace, in the midst of events, that were audibly the first mutterings of\r\nthe earthquake, seemed but little indicative of that philosophic\r\nsagacity, which enables a statesman to see the rudiments of the Future in\r\nthe Present. [Footnote: From the following words in his Speech on the\r\ncommunication from France in 1800, he appears, himself, to have been\r\naware of his want of foresight at the commencement of the war:--\r\n\r\n\"Besides this, the reduction of our Peace Establishment in the year 1791,\r\nand continued to the subsequent year, is a fact, from which the inference\r\nis indisputable; a fact, which, I am afraid, shows not only that we were\r\nnot waiting for the occasion of war, but that, in our partiality for a\r\npacific system, we had indulged ourselves in a fond and credulous\r\nsecurity, which wisdom and discretion would not have dictated.\"] \"It is\r\nnot unreasonable,\" said he on the 21st of February, 1792, \"to expect that\r\nthe peace which we now enjoy should continue at least fifteen years,\r\nsince at no period of the British history, whether we consider the\r\ninternal situation of this kingdom or its relation to foreign powers, has\r\nthe prospect of war been farther removed than at present.\"\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this feeling of security, he, in the course of the\r\nsession of 1791-2, repealed taxes to the amount of 200,000_l_. a\r\nyear, made considerable reductions in the naval and military\r\nestablishments, and allowed the Hessian Subsidy to expire, without any\r\nmovement towards its renewal. He likewise showed his perfect confidence\r\nin the tranquillity of the country, by breaking off a negotiation into\r\nwhich he had entered with the holders of the four per cents, for the\r\nreduction of their stock to three per cent.--saying, in answer to their\r\ndemand of a larger bonus than he thought proper to give, \"Then we will\r\nput off the reduction of this stock till next year.\" The truth is, Mr.\r\nPitt was proud of his financial system;--the abolition of taxes and the\r\nReduction of the National Debt were the two great results to which he\r\nlooked as a proof of its perfection; and while a war, he knew, would\r\nproduce the very reverse of the one, it would leave little more than the\r\nname and semblance of the other.\r\n\r\nThe alarm for the safety of their establishments, which at this time\r\npervaded the great mass of the people of England, earned the proof of its\r\nown needlessness in the wide extent to which it spread, and the very\r\nsmall minority that was thereby left to be the object of apprehension.\r\nThat in this minority, (which was, with few exceptions, confined to the\r\nlower classes,) the elements of sedition and insurrection were actively\r\nat work, cannot be denied. There was not a corner of Europe where the\r\nsame ingredients were not brought into ferment; for the French Revolution\r\nhad not only the violence, but the pervading influence of the Simoom, and\r\nwhile it destroyed where it immediately passed, made itself felt every\r\nwhere. But, surrounded and watched as were the few disaffected in\r\nEngland, by all the rank, property and power of the country,--animated at\r\nthat moment by a more than usual portion of loyalty,--the dangers from\r\nsedition, as yet, were by no means either so deep or extensive, as that a\r\nstrict and vigilant exercise of the laws already in being, would not have\r\nbeen abundantly adequate to all the purposes of their suppression.\r\n\r\nThe admiration, indeed, with which the first dawn of the Revolution was\r\nhailed had considerably abated. The excesses into which the new Republic\r\nbroke loose had alienated the worship of most of its higher class of\r\nvotaries, and in some, as in Mr. Windham, had converted enthusiastic\r\nadmiration into horror;--so that, though a strong sympathy with the\r\ngeneral cause of the Revolution was still felt among the few Whigs that\r\nremained, the profession of its wild, republican theories was chiefly\r\nconfined to two classes of persons, who coincide more frequently than\r\nthey themselves imagine,--the speculative and the ignorant.\r\n\r\nThe Minister, however, gave way to a panic which, there is every reason\r\nto believe, he did not himself participate, and in going out of the\r\nprecincts of the Constitution for new and arbitrary powers, established a\r\nseries of fatal precedents, of which alarmed Authority will be always but\r\ntoo ready to avail itself. By these stretches of power he produced--what\r\nwas far more dangerous than all the ravings of club politicians--that\r\nvehement reaction of feeling on the part of Mr. Fox and his followers,\r\nwhich increased with the increasing rigor of the government, and\r\nsometimes led them to the brink of such modes and principles of\r\nopposition, as aggressions, so wanton, upon liberty alone could have\r\neither provoked or justified.\r\n\r\nThe great promoters of the alarm were Mr. Burke, and those other Whig\r\nSeceders, who had for some time taken part with the administration\r\nagainst their former friends, and, as is usual with such proselytes,\r\noutran those whom they joined, on every point upon which they before most\r\ndiffered from them. To justify their defection, the dangers upon which\r\nthey grounded it, were exaggerated; and the eagerness with which they\r\ncalled for restrictions upon the liberty of the subject was but too\r\nworthy of deserters not only from their post but from their principles.\r\nOne striking difference between these new pupils of Toryism and their\r\nmaster was with respect to the ultimate object of the war.--Mr. Pitt\r\nbeing of opinion that security against the power of France, without any\r\ninterference whatever with her internal affairs, was the sole aim to\r\nwhich hostilities should be directed; while nothing less than the\r\nrestoration of the Bourbons to the power which they possessed before the\r\nassembling of the Etats Genereaux could satisfy Mr. Burke and his fellow\r\nconverts to the cause of Thrones and Hierarchies. The effect of this\r\ndiversity of objects upon the conduct of the war--particularly after Mr.\r\nPitt had added to \"Security for the future,\" the suspicious supplement of\r\n\"Indemnity for the past\"--was no less fatal to the success of operations\r\nabroad than to the unity of councils at home. So separate, indeed, were\r\nthe views of the two parties considered, that the unfortunate expedition,\r\nin aid of the Vendean insurgents in 1795, was known to be peculiarly the\r\nmeasure of the _Burke_ part of the cabinet, and to have been\r\nundertaken on the sole responsibility of their ministerial organ, Mr.\r\nWindham.\r\n\r\nIt must be owned, too, that the obect of the Alarmists in the war,\r\nhowever grossly inconsistent with their former principles, had the merit\r\nof being far more definite than that of Mr. Pitt; and, had it been singly\r\nand consistently pursued from the first, with all the vigor and\r\nconcentration of means so strenuously recommended by Mr. Burke, might\r\nhave justified its quixotism in the end by a more speedy and less ruinous\r\nsuccess. As it was, however, the divisions, jealousies and alarms which\r\nMr. Pitt's views towards a future dismemberment of France excited not\r\nonly among the Continental powers, but among the French themselves,\r\ncompletely defeated every hope and plan for either concert without or co\r\noperation within. At the same time, the distraction of the efforts of\r\nEngland from the heart of French power to its remote extremities, in what\r\nMr. Windham called \"a war upon sugar Islands,\" was a waste of means as\r\nunstatesmanlike as it was calamitous, and fully entitled Mr. Pitt to the\r\nsatire on his policy, conveyed in the remark of a certain distinguished\r\nlady, who said to him, upon hearing of some new acquisition in the West\r\nIndies, \"I protest, Mr. Pitt, if you go on thus, you will soon be master\r\nof every island in the world except just those two little ones, England\r\nand Ireland.\" [Footnote: Mr. Sheridan quoted this anecdote in one of his\r\nspeeches in 1794.]\r\n\r\nThat such was the light in which Mr. Sheridan himself viewed the mode of\r\ncarrying on the war recommended by the Alarmists, in comparison with that\r\nwhich Mr. Pitt in general adopted, appears from the following passage in\r\nhis speech upon Spanish affairs in the year 1808:--\r\n\r\n\"There was hardly a person, except his Right Honorable Friend near him,\r\n(Mr. Windham,) and Mr. Burke, who since the Revolution of France had\r\nformed adequate notions of the necessary steps to be taken. The various\r\ngovernments which this country had seen during that period were always\r\nemployed in filching for a sugar-island, or some other object of\r\ncomparatively trifling moment, while the main and principal purpose was\r\nlost and forgotten,\"\r\n\r\nWhatever were the failures of Mr. Pitt abroad, at home his ascendancy was\r\nfixed and indisputable; and, among all the triumphs of power which he\r\nenjoyed during his career, the tribute now paid to him by the Whig\r\nAristocracy, in taking shelter under his ministry from the dangers of\r\nRevolution, could not have been the least gratifying to his haughty\r\nspirit. The India Bill had ranged on his side the King and the People,\r\nand the Revolution now brought to his banner the flower of the Nobility\r\nof both parties. His own estimate of rank may be fairly collected both\r\nfrom the indifference which he showed to its honors himself, and from the\r\ndepreciating profusion with which he lavished them upon others. It may be\r\ndoubted whether his respect for Aristocracy was much increased, by the\r\nreadiness which he now saw in some of his high-born opponents, to\r\nvolunteer for safety into his already powerful ranks, without even\r\npausing to try the experiment, whether safety might not have been\r\nreconcilable with principle in their own. It is certain that, without the\r\naccession of so much weight and influence, he never could have ventured\r\nupon the violations of the Constitution that followed--nor would the\r\nOpposition, accordingly, have been driven by these excesses of power into\r\nthat reactive violence which was the natural consequence of an effort to\r\nresist them. The prudent apprehensions, therefore, of these Noble Whigs\r\nwould have been much more usefully as well as honorably employed, in\r\nmingling with, and moderating the proceedings of the friends of Liberty,\r\nthan in ministering fresh fuel to the zeal and vindictiveness of her\r\nenemies. [Footnote: The case against these Noble Seceders is thus\r\nspiritedly stated by Lord Moira:--\r\n\r\n\"I cannot ever sit in a cabinet with the Duke of Portland. He appears to\r\nme to have done more injury to the Constitution and to the estimation of\r\nthe higher ranks in this country than any man on the political stage. By\r\nhis union with Mr. Pitt he has given it to be understood by the people,\r\nthat either all the constitutional charges which he and his friends for\r\nso many years urged against Mr. Put were groundless, or that, being\r\nsolid, there was no difficulty in waving them when a convenient partition\r\nof powers and emoluments was proposed. In either case the people must\r\ninfer that the constitutional principle which can be so played with is\r\nunimportant, and that parliamentary professions are no security.\"\r\n--_Letter from the Earl of Moira to Colonel M'Mahon, in 1797.\r\nParliamentary History_.]\r\n\r\nIt may be added, too, that in allowing themselves to be persuaded by\r\nBurke, that the extinction of the ancient Noblesse of France portended\r\nnecessarily any danger to the English Aristocracy, these Noble persons\r\ndid injustice to the strength of their own order, and to the\r\ncharacteristics by which it is proudly distinguished from every other\r\nrace of Nobility in Europe. Placed, as a sort of break-water, between the\r\nPeople and the Throne, in a state of double responsibility to liberty on\r\none side, and authority on the other, the Aristocracy of England hold a\r\nstation which is dignified by its own great duties, and of which the\r\ntitles transmitted by their ancestors form the least important ornament.\r\nUnlike the Nobility of other countries, where the rank and privileges of\r\nthe father are multiplied through his offspring, and equally elevate them\r\nall above the level of the community, the very highest English Nobleman\r\nmust consent to be the father but of commoners. Thus, connected with the\r\nclass below him by private as well as public sympathies, he gives his\r\nchildren to the People as hostages for the sincerity of his zeal in their\r\ncause--while on the other hand, the People, in return for these pledges\r\nof the Aristocracy, sends a portion of its own elements aloft into that\r\nhigher region, to mingle with its glories and assert their claim to a\r\nshare in its power. By this mutual transfusion an equilibrium is\r\npreserved, like that which similar processes maintain in the natural\r\nworld, and while a healthy, popular feeling circulates through the\r\nAristocracy, a sense of their own station in the scale elevates the\r\nPeople.\r\n\r\nTo tremble for the safety of a Nobility so constituted, without much\r\nstronger grounds for alarm than appear to have existed in 1793, was an\r\ninjustice not only to that class itself, but the whole nation. The world\r\nhas never yet afforded an example, where this artificial distinction\r\nbetween mankind has been turned to such beneficial account; and as no\r\nmonarchy can exist without such an order, so, in any other shape than\r\nthis, such an order is a burden and a nuisance. In England, so happy a\r\nconformation of her Aristocracy is one of those fortuitous results which\r\ntime and circumstances have brought out in the long-tried experiment of\r\nher Constitution; and, while there is no chance of its being ever again\r\nattained in the Old World, there is but little, probability of its being\r\nattempted in the New,--where the youthful nations now springing into\r\nlife, will, if they are wise, make the most of the free career before\r\nthem, and unencumbered with the costly trappings of feudalism, adopt,\r\nlike their northern neighbors, that form of government, whose simplicity\r\nand cheapness are the best guarantees for its efficacy and purity.\r\n\r\nIn judging of the policy of Mr. Pitt, during the Revolutionary war, his\r\npartisans, we know, laud it as having been the means of salvation to\r\nEngland, while his opponents assert that it was only prevented by chance\r\nfrom being her ruin--and though the event gives an appearance of triumph\r\nto the former opinion, it by no means removes or even weakens the grounds\r\nof the latter. During the first nine years of his administration, Mr.\r\nPitt was, in every respect, an able and most useful minister, and, \"while\r\nthe sea was calm, showed mastership in floating.\" But the great events\r\nthat happened afterwards took him by surprise. When he came to look\r\nabroad from his cabinet into the storm that was brewing through Europe,\r\nthe clear and enlarged view of the higher order of statesman was wanting.\r\nInstead of elevating himself above the influence of the agitation and\r\nalarm that prevailed, he gave way to it with the crowd of ordinary minds,\r\nand even took counsel from the panic of others. The consequence was a\r\nseries of measures, violent at home and inefficient abroad--far short of\r\nthe mark where vigor was wanting, and beyond it, as often, where vigor\r\nwas mischievous.\r\n\r\nWhen we are told to regard his policy as the salvation of the\r\ncountry--when, (to use a figure of Mr. Dundas,) a _claim of salvage_\r\nis made for him--it may be allowed us to consider a little the nature of\r\nthe measures by which this alleged salvation was achieved. If entering\r\ninto a great war without either consistency of plan, or preparation of\r\nmeans, and with a total ignorance of the financial resources of the enemy\r\n[Footnote: Into his erroneous calculations upon this point he is\r\nsupposed to have been led by Sir Francis D'Ivernois.]--if allowing one\r\npart of the Cabinet to flatter the French Royalists, with the hope of\r\nseeing the Bourbons restored to undiminished power, while the other part\r\nacted, whenever an opportunity offered, upon the plan of dismembering\r\nFrance for the aggrandizement of Austria, and thus, at once, alienated\r\nPrussia at the very moment of subsidizing him, and lost the confidence of\r\nall the Royalist party in France, [Footnote: Among other instances, the\r\nAbbé Maury is reported to have said at Rome in a large company of his\r\ncountrymen--\"Still we have one remedy--let us not allow France to be\r\ndivided--we have seen the partition of Poland we must all turn Jacobins\r\nto preserve our country.\"] except the few who were ruined by English\r\nassistance at Quiberon--if going to war in 1793 for the right of the\r\nDutch to a river, and so managing it that in 1794 the Dutch lost their\r\nwhole Seven Provinces--if lavishing more money upon failures than the\r\nsuccesses of a century had cost, and supporting this profusion by schemes\r\nof finance, either hollow and delusive, like the Sinking Fund, or\r\ndesperately regardless of the future, like the paper issues--if driving\r\nIreland into rebellion by the perfidious recall of Lord Fitzwilliam, and\r\nreducing England to two of the most, fearful trials, that a nation,\r\ndepending upon Credit and a navy, could encounter, the stoppage of her\r\nBank and a mutiny in her fleet--if, finally, floundering on from effort\r\nto effort against France, and then dying upon the ruins of the last\r\nCoalition he could muster against her--if all this betokens a wise and\r\nable minister, then is Mr. Pitt most amply entitled to that name;--then\r\nare the lessons of wisdom to be read, like Hebrew, backward, and waste\r\nand rashness and systematic failure to be held the only true means of\r\nsaving a country.\r\n\r\nHad even success, by one of those anomalous accidents, which sometimes\r\nbaffle the best founded calculations of wisdom, been the immediate result\r\nof this long monotony of error, it could not, except with those to whom\r\nthe event is every thing--\"_Eventus, stultorum magister_\"\r\n[Footnote: A saying of the wise Fabius.]--reflect back merit upon the\r\nmeans by which it was achieved, or, by a retrospective miracle, convert\r\nthat into wisdom, which chance had only saved from the worst consequences\r\nof folly. Just as well might we be called upon to pronounce Alchemy a\r\nwise art, because a perseverance in its failures and reveries had led by\r\naccident to the discoveries of Chemistry. But even this sanction of\r\ngood-luck was wanting to the unredeemed mistakes of Mr. Pitt. During the\r\neight years that intervened between his death and the termination of the\r\ncontest, the adoption of a far wiser policy was forced upon his more\r\ntractable pupils; and the only share that his measures can claim in the\r\nsuccessful issue of the war, is that of having produced the grievance\r\nthat was then abated--of having raised up the power opposed to him to the\r\nportentous and dizzy height, from which it then fell by the giddiness of\r\nits own elevation, [Footnote:\r\n\r\n--\"_summisque negatum\r\nStare din_.\"\r\n\r\nLUCAN.] and by the reaction, not of the Princes, but the People of Europe\r\nagainst its yoke.\r\n\r\nWhat would have been the course of affairs, both foreign and domestic,\r\nhad Mr. Fox--as was, at one time, not improbable--been the Minister\r\nduring this period, must be left to that superhuman knowledge, which the\r\nschoolmen call \"_media scientia_,\" and which consists in knowing all\r\nthat would have happened, had events been otherwise than they have been.\r\nIt is probable that some of the results would not have been so different\r\nas the respective principles of Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox might naturally lead\r\nus, on the first thought, to assert. If left to himself, there is little\r\ndoubt that the latter, from the simple and fearless magnanimity of his\r\nnature, would have consulted for the public safety with that moderation\r\nwhich true courage inspires; and that, even had it been necessary to\r\nsuspend the Constitution for a season, he would have known how to veil\r\nthe statue of Liberty, [Footnote: \"_Il y a des cas ou il faut mettre\r\npour un moment un voile sur la Liberté, comme l'on cache les statues des\r\ndieux_.\"--MONTESQUIEU, liv. xii. chap. 20.] without leaving like his\r\nrival, such marks of mutilation on its limbs. But it is to be recollected\r\nthat he would have had to encounter, in his own ranks, the very same\r\npatrician alarm, which could even to Mr. Pitt give an increase of\r\nmomentum against liberty, and which the possession of power would have\r\nrendered but more sensitive and arbitrary. Accustomed, too, as he had\r\nlong been, to yield to the influence of Burke, it would have required\r\nmore firmness than habitually belonged to Mr. Fox, to withstand the\r\npersevering impetuosity of such a counsellor, or keep the balance of his\r\nmind unshaken by those stupendous powers, which, like the horses of the\r\nSun breaking out of the ecliptic, carried every thing they seized upon,\r\nso splendidly astray:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_quaque impetus egit,\r\n  Hac sine lege ruunt, altoque sub aethere fixis\r\n  Incursant stellis, rapiuntque per avia currum_.\"\r\n\r\n  Where'er the impulse drives, they burst away\r\n  In lawless grandeur;--break into the array\r\n  Of the fix'd stars, and bound and blaze along\r\n  Their devious course, magnificently wrong!\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving hazarded these general observations, upon the views and conduct of\r\nthe respective parties of England, during the Crusade now begun against\r\nthe French people, I shall content myself with briefly and cursorily\r\nnoticing the chief questions upon which Mr. Sheridan distinguished\r\nhimself, in the course of the parliamentary campaigns that followed. The\r\nsort of _guerilla_ warfare, which he and the rest of the small band\r\nattached to Mr. Fox carried on, during this period, against the invaders\r\nof the Constitution, is interesting rather by its general character than\r\nits detail; for in these, as usual, the episodes of party personality are\r\nfound to encroach disproportionately on the main design, and the grandeur\r\nof the cause, as viewed at a distance, becomes diminished to our\r\nimaginations by too near an approach. Englishmen, however, will long look\r\nback to that crisis with interest; and the names of Fox, of Sheridan, and\r\nof Grey will be affectionately remembered, when that sort of false\r\nelevation, which party-feeling now gives to the reputations of some who\r\nwere opposed to them, shall have subsided to its due level, or been\r\nsucceeded by oblivion. They who act against the general sympathies of\r\nmankind, however they may be artificially buoyed up for the moment, have\r\nthe current against them in the long run of fame; while the reputation of\r\nthose, whose talents have been employed upon the popular and generous\r\nside of human feelings, receives, through all time, an accelerating\r\nimpulse from the countless hearts that go with it in its course. Lord\r\nChatham, even now, supersedes his son in fame, and will leave him at an\r\nimmeasurable distance with posterity.\r\n\r\nOf the events of the private life of Mr. Sheridan, during this stormy\r\npart of his political career, there remain but few memorials among his\r\npapers. As an illustration, however, of his love of betting--the only\r\nsort of gambling in which he ever indulged--the following curious list\r\nof his wagers for the year is not unamusing:--\r\n\r\n_\"25th May, 1793._--Mr. Sheridan bets Gen.

Windham represents Norwich at the\r\nnext general election.\"\r\n\r\nAs a sort of moral supplement to this strange list, and one of those\r\ninsights into character and conduct which it is the duty of a biographer\r\nto give, I shall subjoin a letter, connected evidently with one of the\r\nabove speculations:--\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry that I have been so circumstanced as to have been\r\nobliged to disappoint you respecting the payment of the five hundred\r\nguineas: when I gave the draughts on Lord * * I had every reason to be\r\nassured he would accept them, as * * had also. I enclose you, as you will\r\nsee by his desire, the letter in which he excuses his not being able to\r\npay me this part of a larger sum he owes me, and I cannot refuse him any\r\ntime he requires, however inconvenient to me. I also enclose you two\r\ndraughts accepted by a gentleman from whom the money will be due to me,\r\nand on whose punctuality I can rely. I extremely regret that I cannot at\r\nthis juncture command the money.\r\n\r\n\"At the same time that I regret your being put to any inconvenience by\r\nthis delay, I cannot help adverting to the circumstance which perhaps\r\nmisled me into the expectation that you would not unwillingly allow me\r\nany reasonable time I might want for the payment of this bet. The\r\ncircumstance I mean, however discreditable the plea, is the total\r\ninebriety of some of the party, particularly of myself, when I made this\r\npreposterous bet. I doubt not you will remember having yourself observed\r\non this circumstance to a common friend the next day, with an intimation\r\nthat you should not object to being off; and for my part, when I was\r\ninformed that I had made such a bet and for such a sum,--the first, such\r\nfolly on the face of it on my part, and the latter so out of my\r\npractice,--I certainly should have proposed the cancelling it, but that,\r\nfrom the intimation imparted to me, I hoped the proposition might come\r\nfrom you.\r\n\r\n\"I hope I need not for a moment beg you not to imagine that I am now\r\nalluding to these circumstances as the slightest invalidation of your\r\ndue. So much the contrary, that I most perfectly admit that from your not\r\nhaving heard any thing further from me on the subject, and especially\r\nafter I might have heard that if I desired it the bet might be off, you\r\nhad every reason to conclude that I was satisfied with the wager, and\r\nwhether made in wine or not, was desirous of abiding by it. And this was\r\nfurther confirmed by my receiving soon after from you 100_l_, on\r\nanother bet won by me.\r\n\r\n\"Having, I think, put this point very fairly, I again repeat that my only\r\nmotive for alluding to the matter was, as some explanation of my seeming\r\ndilatoriness, which certainly did in part arise from always conceiving\r\nthat, whenever I should state what was my real wish the day after the bet\r\nwas made, you would be the more disposed to allow a little time;--the\r\nsame statement admitting, as it must, the bet to be as clearly and as\r\nfairly won as possible; in short, as if I had insisted on it myself the\r\nnext morning.\r\n\r\n\"I have said more perhaps on the subject than can be necessary; but I\r\nshould regret to appear negligent to an application for a just claim.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to be,\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"_Hertford St. Feb. 26._\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\nOf the public transactions of Sheridan at this time, his speeches are the\r\nbest record. To them, therefore, I shall henceforward principally refer\r\nmy readers,--premising, that though the reports of his latter speeches\r\nare somewhat better, in general, than those of his earlier displays, they\r\nstill do great injustice to his powers, and exhibit little more than the\r\nmere _Torso_ of his eloquence, curtailed of all those accessories\r\nthat lent motion and beauty to its form. The attempts to give the\r\nterseness of his wit particularly fail, and are a strong illustration of\r\nwhat he himself once said to Lord * *. That Nobleman, who among his many\r\nexcellent qualities does not include a very lively sense of humor, having\r\nexclaimed, upon hearing some good anecdote from Sheridan, \"I'll go and\r\ntell that to our friend * *.\" Sheridan called him back instantly and\r\nsaid, with much gravity, \"For God's sake, don't, my dear * *: a joke is\r\nno laughing matter in your mouth.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, singular, that all the eminent English orators--with the\r\nexception of Mr. Burke and Mr. Windham--should have been so little\r\nanxious for the correct transmission of their eloquence to posterity. Had\r\nnot Cicero taken more care of even his extemporaneous effusions, we\r\nshould have lost that masterly burst of the moment, to which the clemency\r\nof Caesar towards Marcellus gave birth. The beautiful fragments we have\r\nof Lord Chatham are rather traditional than recorded;--there are but two,\r\nI believe, of the speeches of Mr. Pitt corrected by himself, those on the\r\nBudget of 1792, and on the Union with Ireland;--Mr. Fox committed to\r\nwriting but one of his, namely, the tribute to the memory of the Duke of\r\nBedford;--and the only speech of Mr. Sheridan, that is known with\r\ncertainty to have passed under his own revision, was that which he made\r\nat the opening of the following session, (1794,) in answer to Lord\r\nMornington.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the present year he took frequent opportunities of\r\nexpressing his disgust at that spirit of ferocity which had so deeply\r\ndisgraced the cause of the Revolution. So earnest was his interest in the\r\nfate of the Royal Family of France, that, as appears from one of his\r\nspeeches, he drew up a paper on the subject, and transmitted it to the\r\nrepublican rulers;--with the view, no doubt, of conveying to them the\r\nfeelings of the English Opposition, and endeavoring to avert, by the\r\ninfluence of his own name and that of Mr. Fox, the catastrophe that\r\nawaited those Royal victims of liberty. Of this interesting document I\r\ncannot discover any traces.\r\n\r\nIn one of his answers to Burke on the subject of the French Revolution,\r\nadverting to the charge of Deism and Atheism brought against the\r\nrepublicans, he says,\r\n\r\n\"As an argument to the feelings and passions of men, the Honorable Member\r\nhad great advantages in dwelling on this topic; because it was a subject\r\nwhich those who disliked everything that had the air of cant and\r\nprofession on the one hand, or of indifference on the other, found it\r\nawkward to meddle with. Establishments, tests, and matters of that\r\nnature, were proper objects of political discussion in that House, but\r\nnot general charges of Atheism and Deism, as pressed upon their\r\nconsideration by the Honorable Gentleman. Thus far, however, he would\r\nsay, and it was an opinion he had never changed or concealed, that,\r\nalthough no man can command his conviction, he had ever considered a\r\ndeliberate disposition to make proselytes in infidelity as an\r\nunaccountable depravity. Whoever attempted to pluck the belief or the\r\nprejudice on this subject, style it which he would, from the bosom of one\r\nman, woman, or child, committed a brutal outrage, the motive for which he\r\nhad never been able to trace or conceive.\"\r\n\r\nI quote these words as creditable to the feeling and good sense of\r\nSheridan. Whatever may be thought of particular faiths and sects, a\r\nbelief in a life beyond this world is the only thing that pierces through\r\nthe walls of our prison-house, and lets hope shine in upon a scene, that\r\nwould be otherwise bewildered and desolate. The proselytism of the\r\nAtheist is, indeed, a dismal mission. That believers, who have each the\r\nsame heaven in prospect, should invite us to join them on their\r\nrespective ways to it, is at least a benevolent officiousness,--but that\r\nhe, who has no prospect or hope himself, should seek for companionship in\r\nhis road to annihilation, can only be explained by that tendency in human\r\ncreatures to count upon each other in their despair, as well as their\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nIn the speech upon his own motion relative to the existence of seditious\r\npractices in the country, there is some lively ridicule, upon the panic\r\nthen prevalent. For instance:--\r\n\r\n\"The alarm had been brought forward in great pomp and form on Saturday\r\nmorning. At night all the mail-coaches were stopped; the Duke of Richmond\r\nstationed himself, among other curiosities, at the Tower; a great\r\nmunicipal officer, too, had made a discovery exceedingly beneficial to\r\nthe people of this country. He meant the Lord Mayor of London, who had\r\nfound out that there was at the King's Arms at Cornhill a Debating\r\nSociety, where principles of the most dangerous tendency were propagated;\r\nwhere people went to buy treason at sixpence a head; where it was\r\nretailed to them by the glimmering of an inch of candle; and five\r\nminutes, to be measured by the glass, were allowed to each traitor to\r\nperform his part in overturning the State.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in the same speech that he gave the well-known and happy turn to\r\nthe motto of the Sun newspaper, which was at that time known to be the\r\norgan of the Alarmists. \"There was one paper,\" he remarked, \"in\r\nparticular, said to be the property of members of that House, and\r\npublished and conducted under their immediate direction, which had for\r\nits motto a garbled part of a beautiful sentence, when it might, with\r\nmuch more propriety, have assumed the whole--\r\n\r\n    \"Solem quis dicere falsum\r\n  Audeat? Ille etiam cacos instare tumultus\r\n  Saepe monet, fraudemque et operta tumescere bella.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the subjects that occupied the greatest share of his attention\r\nduring this Session, was the Memorial of Lord Auckland to the\r\nStates-General,--which document he himself brought under the notice of\r\nParliament as deserving of severe reprobation for the violent and\r\nvindictive tone which it assumed towards the Commissioners of the\r\nNational Convention. It was upon one of the discussions connected with\r\nthis subject that a dispute, as to the correct translation of the word\r\n\"_malheureux_\" was maintained with much earnestness between him and\r\nLord Melville--two persons, the least qualified, perhaps, of any in the\r\nHouse, to volunteer as either interpreters or pronouncers of the French\r\nlanguage. According to Sheridan, \"_ces malheureux_\" was to be\r\ntranslated \"these wretches,\" while Lord Melville contended, to the no\r\nsmall amusement of the House, that \"_mollyroo_\" (as he pronounced\r\nit,) meant no more than \"these unfortunate gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nIn the November of this year Mr. Sheridan lost by a kind of death which\r\nmust have deepened the feeling of the loss, the most intimate of all his\r\ncompanions, Tickell. If congeniality of dispositions and pursuits were\r\nalways a strengthener of affection, the friendship between Tickell and\r\nSheridan ought to have been of the most cordial kind; for they resembled\r\neach other in almost every particular--in their wit, their wants, their\r\ntalent, and their thoughtlessness. It is but too true, however, that\r\nfriendship in general gains far less by such a community of pursuit than\r\nit loses by the competition that naturally springs out of it; and that\r\ntwo wits or two beauties form the last sort of alliance, in which we\r\nought to look for specimens of sincere and cordial friendship. The\r\nintercourse between Tickell and Sheridan was not free from such\r\ncollisions of vanity. They seem to have lived, indeed, in a state of\r\nalternate repulsion and attraction; and, unable to do without the\r\nexcitement of each other's vivacity, seldom parted without trials of\r\ntemper as well as of wit. Being both, too, observers of character, and\r\neach finding in the other rich materials for observation, their love of\r\nridicule could not withstand such a temptation, and they freely\r\ncriticised each other to common friends, who, as is usually the case,\r\nagreed with both. Still, however, there was a whim and sprightliness even\r\nabout their mischief, which made it seem rather an exercise of ingenuity\r\nthan an indulgence of ill nature; and if they had not carried on this\r\nintellectual warfare, neither would have liked the other half so well.\r\n\r\nThe two principal productions of Tickell, the \"Wreath of Fashion\" and\r\n\"Anticipation,\" were both upon temporary subjects, and have accordingly\r\npassed into oblivion. There are, however, some graceful touches of\r\npleasantry in the poem; and the pamphlet, (which procured for him not\r\nonly fame but a place in the Stamp-office,) contains passages of which\r\nthe application and the humor have not yet grown stale. As Sheridan is\r\nthe hero of the Wreath of Fashion, it is but right to quote the verses\r\nthat relate to him; and I do it with the more pleasure, because they also\r\ncontain a well-merited tribute to Mrs. Sheridan. After a description of\r\nthe various poets of the day that deposit their offerings in Lady\r\nMillar's \"Vase of Sentiment,\" the author thus proceeds:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"At Fashion's shrine behold a gentler bard\r\n  Gaze on the mystic vase with fond regard--\r\n  But see, Thalia checks the doubtful thought,\r\n  'Canst thou, (she cries,) with sense, with genius fraught,\r\n  Canst thou to Fashion's tyranny submit,\r\n  Secure in native, independent wit?\r\n  Or yield to Sentiment's insipid rule,\r\n  By Taste, by Fancy, chac'd through Scandal's school?\r\n  Ah no--be Sheridan's the comic page,\r\n  Or let me fly with Garrick from the stage.\r\n  Haste then, my friend, (for let me boast that name,)\r\n  Haste to the opening path of genuine fame;\r\n  Or, if thy muse a gentler theme pursue,\r\n  Ah, 'tis to love and thy Eliza due!\r\n  For, sure, the sweetest lay she well may claim,\r\n  Whose soul breathes harmony o'er all her frame;\r\n  While wedded love, with ray serenely clear,\r\n  Beams from her eye, as from its proper sphere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1781, Tickell brought out at Drury-Lane an opera called \"The\r\nCarnival of Venice,\" on which there is the following remark in Mrs.\r\nCrouch's Memoirs:--\"Many songs in this piece so perfectly resemble in\r\npoetic beauty those which adorn The Duenna, that they declare themselves\r\nto be the offspring of the same muse.\" I know not how far this conjecture\r\nmay be founded, but there are four pretty lines which I remember in this\r\nopera, and which, it may be asserted without hesitation, Sheridan never\r\nwrote. He had no feeling for natural scenery, [Footnote: In corroboration\r\nof this remark, I have been allowed to quote the following passage of a\r\nletter written by a very eminent person, whose name all lovers of the\r\nPicturesque associate with their best enjoyment of its beauties:--\r\n\r\n\"At one time I saw a good deal of Sheridan--he and his first wife passed\r\nsome time here, and he is an instance that a taste for poetry and for\r\nscenery are not always united. Had this house been in the midst of\r\nHounslow Heath, he could not have taken less interest in all around it:\r\nhis delight was in shooting, all and every day, and my game-keeper said\r\nthat of all the gentlemen he had ever been out with he never knew so bad\r\na shot.\"] nor is there a trace of such a sentiment discoverable through\r\nhis poetry. The following, as well as I can recollect, are the lines:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"And while the moon shines on the stream,\r\n    And as soft music breathes around,\r\n  The feathering oar returns the gleam,\r\n    And dips in concert to the sound.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already given a humorous Dedication of the Rivals, written by\r\nTickell on the margin of a copy of that play in my possession. I shall\r\nnow add another piece of still more happy humor, with which he has\r\nfilled, in very neat hand-writing, the three or four first pages of the\r\nsame copy.\r\n\r\n\"The Rivals, a Comedy--one of the best in the English language--written\r\nas long ago as the reign of George the Third. The author's name was\r\nSheridan--he is mentioned by the historians of that age as a man of\r\nuncommon abilities, very little improved by cultivation. His confidence\r\nin the resources of his own genius and his aversion to any sort of labor\r\nwere so great that he could not be prevailed upon to learn either to read\r\nor write. He was, for a short time, Manager of one the play-houses, and\r\nconceived the extraordinary and almost incredible project of composing a\r\nplay extempore, which he was to recite in the Green-room to the actors,\r\nwho were immediately to come on the stage and perform it. The players\r\nrefusing to undertake their parts at so short a notice, and with so\r\nlittle preparation, he threw up the management in disgust.\r\n\r\n\"He was a member of the last Parliaments that were summoned in England,\r\nand signalized himself on many occasions by his wit and eloquence, though\r\nhe seldom came to the House till the debate was nearly concluded, and\r\nnever spoke, unless he was drunk. He lived on a footing of great intimacy\r\nwith the famous Fox, who is said to have concerted with him the audacious\r\nattempt which he made, about the year 1783, to seize the whole property\r\nof the East India Company, amounting at that time to above\r\n12,000,000_l_. sterling, and then to declare himself Lord Protector\r\nof the realm by the title of Carlo Khan. This desperate scheme actually\r\nreceived the consent of the lower House of Parliament, the majority of\r\nwhom were bribed by Fox, or intimidated by his and Sheridan's threats and\r\nviolence: and it is generally believed that the Revolution would have\r\ntaken place, if the Lords of the King's Bedchamber had not in a body\r\nsurrounded the throne and shown the most determined resolution not to\r\nabandon their posts but with their lives. The usurpation being defeated,\r\nParliament was dissolved and loaded with infamy. Sheridan was one of the\r\nfew members of it who were re-elected:--the Burgesses of Stafford, whom\r\nhe had kept in a constant state of intoxication for near three weeks,\r\nchose him again to represent them, which he was well qualified to do.\r\n\r\n\"Fox's Whig party being very much reduced, or rather almost annihilated,\r\nhe and the rest of the conspirators remained quiet for some time; till,\r\nin the year 1788, the French, in conjunction with Tippoo Sultan, having\r\nsuddenly seized and divided between themselves the whole of the British\r\npossessions in India, the East India Company broke, and a national\r\nbankruptcy was apprehended. During this confusion Fox and his partisans\r\nassembled in large bodies, and made a violent attack in Parliament on\r\nPitt, the King's first minister:--Sheridan supported and seconded him.\r\nParliament seemed disposed to inquire into the cause of the calamity: the\r\nnation was almost in a state of actual rebellion; and it is impossible\r\nfor us, at the distance of three hundred years, to form any judgment what\r\ndreadful consequences might have followed, if the King, by the advice of\r\nthe Lords of the Bedchamber, had not dissolved the Parliament, and taken\r\nthe administration of affairs into his own hands, and those of a few\r\nconfidential servants, at the head of whom he was pleased to place one\r\nMr. Atkinson, a merchant, who had acquired a handsome fortune in the\r\nJamaica trade, and passed universally for a man of unblemished integrity.\r\nHis Majesty having now no farther occasion for Pitt, and being desirous\r\nof rewarding him for his past services, and, at the same time, finding an\r\nadequate employment for his great talents, caused him to enter into holy\r\norders, and presented him with the Deanery of Windsor; where he became an\r\nexcellent preacher, and published several volumes of sermons, all of\r\nwhich are now lost.\r\n\r\n\"To return to Sheridan:--on the abrogation of Parliaments, he entered\r\ninto a closer connection than ever with Fox and a few others of lesser\r\nnote, forming together as desperate and profligate a gang as ever\r\ndisgraced a civilized country. They were guilty of every species of\r\nenormity, and went so far as even to commit robberies on the highway,\r\nwith a degree of audacity that could be equalled only by the ingenuity\r\nwith which they escaped conviction. Sheridan, not satisfied with eluding,\r\ndetermined to mock the justice of his country, and composed a Masque\r\ncalled 'The Foresters,' containing a circumstantial account of some of\r\nthe robberies he had committed, and a good deal of sarcasm on the\r\npusillanimity of those whom he had robbed, and the inefficacy of the\r\npenal laws of the kingdom. This piece was acted at Drury-Lane Theatre\r\nwith great applause, to the astonishment of all sober persons, and the\r\nscandal of the nation. His Majesty, who had long wished to curb the\r\nlicentiousness of the press and the theatres, thought this a good\r\nopportunity. He ordered the performers to be enlisted into the army, the\r\nplay-house to be shut up, and all theatrical exhibitions to be forbid on\r\npain of death, Drury-Lane play-house was soon after converted into a\r\nbarrack for soldiers, which it has continued to be ever since. Sheridan\r\nwas arrested, and, it was imagined, would have suffered the rack, if he\r\nhad not escaped from his guard by a stratagem, and gone over to Ireland\r\nin a balloon with which his friend Fox furnished him. Immediately on his\r\narrival in Ireland, he put himself at the head of a party of the most\r\nviolent Reformers, commanded a regiment of Volunteers at the siege of\r\nDublin in 1791, and was supposed to be the person who planned the scheme\r\nfor tarring and feathering Mr. Jenkinson, the Lord Lieutenant, and\r\nforcing him in that condition to sign the capitulation of the Castle. The\r\npersons who were to execute this strange enterprise had actually got into\r\nthe Lord Lieutenant's apartment at midnight, and would probably have\r\nsucceeded in their project, if Sheridan, who was intoxicated with\r\nwhiskey, a strong liquor much in vogue with the Volunteers, had not\r\nattempted to force open the door of Mrs. ----'s bed-chamber, and so given\r\nthe alarm to the garrison, who instantly flew to arms, seized Sheridan\r\nand every one of his party, and confined them in the castle-dungeon.\r\nSheridan was ordered for execution the next day, but had no sooner got\r\nhis legs and arms at liberty, than he began capering, jumping, dancing,\r\nand making all sorts of antics, to the utter amazement of the spectators.\r\nWhen the chaplain endeavored, by serious advice and admonition, to bring\r\nhim to a proper sense of his dreadful situation, he grinned, made faces\r\nat him, tried to tickle him, and played a thousand other pranks with such\r\nastonishing drollery, that the gravest countenances became cheerful, and\r\nthe saddest hearts glad. The soldiers who attended at the gallows were so\r\ndelighted with his merriment, which they deemed magnanimity, that the\r\nsheriffs began to apprehend a rescue, and ordered the hangman instantly\r\nto do his duty. He went off in a loud horse-laugh, and cast a look\r\ntowards the Castle, accompanied with a gesture expressive of no great\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\"Thus ended the life of this singular and unhappy man--a melancholy\r\ninstance of the calamities that attend the misapplication of great and\r\nsplendid ability. He was married to a very beautiful and amiable woman,\r\nfor whom he is said to have entertained an unalterable affection. He had\r\none son, a boy of the most promising hopes, whom he would never suffer to\r\nbe instructed in the first rudiments of literature. He amused himself,\r\nhowever, with teaching the boy to draw portraits with his toes, in which\r\nhe soon became so astonishing a proficient that he seldom failed to take\r\na most exact likeness of every person who sat to him.\r\n\r\n\"There are a few more plays by the same author, all of them excellent.\r\n\r\n\"For further information concerning this strange man, vide 'Macpherson's\r\nMoral History,' Art.

CANNING.--EVIDENCE ON THE TRIAL OF HORNE TOOKE.--THE\r\n\"GLORIOUS FIRST OF JUNE.\"--MARRIAGE OF MR. SHERIDAN.--PAMPHLET OF MR.\r\nREEVES.--DEBTS OF THE PRINCE OF WALES.--SHAKSPEARE MANUSCRIPTS.--TRIAL\r\nOF STONE.--MUTINY AT THE NORE.--SECESSION OF MR. FOX FROM PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1794, the natural consequences of the policy pursued by Mr.\r\nPitt began rapidly to unfold themselves both at home and abroad.\r\n[Footnote: See, for a masterly exposure of the errors of the War, the\r\nSpeech of Lord Lansdowne this year on bringing forward his Motion for\r\nPeace.\r\n\r\nI cannot let the name of this Nobleman pass, without briefly expressing\r\nthe deep gratitude which I feel to him, not only for his own kindness to\r\nme, when introduced, as a boy, to his notice, but for the friendship of\r\nhis truly Noble descendant, which I, in a great degree, owe to him, and\r\nwhich has long been the pride and happiness of my life.] The confederated\r\nPrinces of the Continent, among whom the gold of England was now the sole\r\nbond of union, had succeeded as might be expected from so noble an\r\nincentive, and, powerful only in provoking France, had by every step they\r\ntook but ministered to her aggrandizement. In the mean time, the measures\r\nof the English Minister at home were directed to the two great objects of\r\nhis legislation--the raising of supplies and the suppressing of sedition;\r\nor, in other words, to the double and anomalous task of making the people\r\npay for the failures of their Royal allies, and suffer for their sympathy\r\nwith the success of their republican enemies. It is the opinion of a\r\nlearned Jesuit that it was by _aqua regia_ the Golden Calf of the\r\nIsraelites was dissolved--and the cause of Kings was the Royal solvent,\r\nin which the wealth of Great Britain now melted irrecoverably away. While\r\nthe successes, too, of the French had already lowered the tone of the\r\nMinister from projects of aggression to precautions of defence, the\r\nwounds which in the wantonness of alarm, he had inflicted on the\r\nliberties of the country, were spreading an inflammation around them that\r\nthreatened real danger. The severity of the sentence upon Muir and Palmer\r\nin Scotland, and the daring confidence with which charges of High Treason\r\nwere exhibited against persons who were, at the worst, but indiscreet\r\nreformers, excited the apprehensions of even the least sensitive friends\r\nof freedom. It is, indeed, difficult to say how far the excited temper of\r\nthe Government, seconded by the ever ready subservience of state-lawyers\r\nand bishops, might have proceeded at this moment, had not the acquittal\r\nof Tooke and his associates, and the triumph it diffused through the\r\ncountry, given a lesson to Power such as England is alone capable of\r\ngiving, and which will long be remembered, to the honor of that great\r\npolitical safeguard,--that Life-preserver in stormy times,--the Trial by\r\nJury.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the Session, Mr. Sheridan delivered his admirable\r\nanswer to Lord Mornington, the report of which, as I have already said,\r\nwas corrected for publication by himself. In this fine speech, of which\r\nthe greater part must have been unprepared, there is a natural\r\nearnestness of feeling and argument that is well contrasted with the able\r\nbut artificial harangue that preceded it. In referring to the details\r\nwhich Lord Mornington had entered into of the various atrocities\r\ncommitted in France, he says:--\r\n\r\n\"But what was the sum of all that he had told the House? that great and\r\ndreadful enormities had been committed, at which the heart shuddered, and\r\nwhich not merely wounded every feeling of humanity, but disgusted and\r\nsickened the soul. All this was most true; but what did all this prove?\r\nWhat, but that eternal and unalterable truth which had always presented\r\nitself to his mind, in whatever way he had viewed the subject, namely,\r\nthat a long established despotism so far degraded and debased human\r\nnature, as to render its subjects, on the first recovery of their rights,\r\nunfit for the exercise of them. But never had he, or would he meet but\r\nwith re probation that mode of argument which went, in fact, to\r\nestablish, as an inference from this truth, that those who had been long\r\nslaves, ought therefore to remain so for over! No; the lesson ought to\r\nbe, he would again repeat, a tenfold horror of that despotic form of\r\ngovernment, which had so profaned and changed the nature of civilized\r\nman, and a still more jealous apprehension of any system tending to\r\nwithhold the rights and liberties of our fellow-creatures. Such a form of\r\ngovernment might be considered as twice cursed; while it existed, it was\r\nsolely responsible for the miseries and calamities of its subjects; and\r\nshould a day of retribution come, and the tyranny be destroyed, it was\r\nequally to be charged with all the enormities which the folly or frenzy\r\nof those who overturned it should commit.\r\n\r\n\"But the madness of the French people was not confined to their\r\nproceedings within their own country; we, and all the Powers of Europe,\r\nhad to dread it. True; but was not this also to be accounted for? Wild\r\nand unsettled as their state of mind was, necessarily, upon the events\r\nwhich had thrown such power so suddenly into their hands, the surrounding\r\nStates had goaded them into a still more savage state of madness, fury,\r\nand desperation. We had unsettled their reason, and then reviled their\r\ninsanity; we drove them to the extremities that produced the evils we\r\narraigned; we baited them like wild beasts, until at length we made them\r\nso. The conspiracy of Pilnitz, and the brutal threats of the Royal\r\nabettors of that plot against the rights of nations and of men, had, in\r\ntruth, to answer for all the additional misery, horrors, and iniquity,\r\nwhich had since disgraced and incensed humanity. Such has been your\r\nconduct towards France, that you have created the passions which you\r\npersecute; you mark a nation to be cut off from the world; you covenant\r\nfor their extermination; you swear to hunt them in their inmost recesses;\r\nyou load them with every species of execration; and you now come forth\r\nwith whining declamations on the horror of their turning upon you with\r\nthe fury which you inspired.\"\r\n\r\nHaving alluded to an assertion of Condorcet, quoted by Lord Mornington,\r\nthat \"Revolutions are always the work of the minority,\" he adds\r\nlivelily:--\r\n\r\n\"--If this be true, it certainly is a most ominous thing for the enemies\r\nof Reform in England; for, if it holds true, of necessity, that the\r\nminority still prevails, in national contests, it must be a consequence\r\nthat the smaller the minority the more certain must be the success. In\r\nwhat a dreadful situation then must the Noble Lord be and all the\r\nAlarmists!--for, never surely was a minority so small, so thin in number\r\nas the present. Conscions, however, that M. Condorcet was mistaken in our\r\nobject, I am glad to find that we are terrible in proportion as we are\r\nfew; I rejoice that the liberality of secession which has thinned our\r\nranks has only served to make us more formidable. The Alarmists will hear\r\nthis with new apprehensions; they will no doubt return to us with a view\r\nto diminish our force, and encumber us with their alliance in order to\r\nreduce us to insignificance.\"\r\n\r\nWe have here another instance, in addition to the many that have been\r\ngiven, of the beauties that sprung up under Sheridan's correcting hand.\r\nThis last pointed sentence was originally thus: \"And we shall swell our\r\nnumbers in order to come nearer in a balance of insignificance to the\r\nnumerous host of the majority.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at this time evident that the great Whig Seceders would soon yield\r\nto the invitations of Mr. Pitt and the vehement persuasions of Burke, and\r\ncommit themselves still further with the Administration by accepting of\r\noffice. Though the final arrangements to this effect were not completed\r\ntill the summer, on account of the lingering reluctance of the Duke of\r\nPortland and Mr. Windham, Lord Loughborough and others of the former\r\nOpposition had already put on the official livery of the Minister. It is\r\nto be regretted that, in almost all cases of conversion to the side of\r\npower, the coincidence of some worldly advantage with the change should\r\nmake it difficult to decide upon the sincerity or disinterestedness of\r\nthe convert. That these Noble Whigs were sincere in their alarm there is\r\nno reason to doubt; but the lesson of loyalty they have transmitted would\r\nhave been far more edifying, had the usual corollary of honors and\r\nemoluments not followed, and had they left at least one instance of\r\npolitical conversion on record, where the truth was its own sole reward,\r\nand the proselyte did not subside into the placeman. Mr. Sheridan was\r\nnaturally indignant at these desertions, and his bitterness overflows in\r\nmany passages of the speech before us. Lord Mornington having contrasted\r\nthe privations and sacrifices demanded of the French by their Minister of\r\nFinance with those required of the English nation, he says in answer:--\r\n\r\n\"The Noble Lord need not remind us, that there is no great danger of our\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer making any such experiment. I can more easily\r\nfancy another sort of speech for our prudent Minister. I can more easily\r\nconceive him modestly comparing himself and his own measures with the\r\ncharacter and conduct of his rival, and saying,--'Do I demand of you,\r\nwealthy citizens, to lend your hoards to Government without interest? On\r\nthe contrary, when I shall come to propose a loan, there is not a man of\r\nyou to whom I shall not hold out at least a job in every part of the\r\nsubscription, and an usurious profit upon every pound you devote to the\r\nnecessities of your country. Do I demand of you, my fellow-placemen and\r\nbrother-pensioners, that you should sacrifice any part of your stipends\r\nto the public exigency? On the contrary; am I not daily increasing your\r\nemoluments and your numbers in proportion as the country becomes unable\r\nto provide for you? Do I require of you, my latest and most zealous\r\nproselytes, of you who have come over to me for the special purpose of\r\nsupporting the war--a war, on the success of which you solemnly protest,\r\nthat the salvation of Britain, and of civil society itself, depend--do I\r\nrequire of you, that you should make a temporary sacrifice, in the cause\r\nof human nature, of the greater part of your private incomes? No,\r\ngentlemen, I scorn to take advantage of the eagerness of your zeal; and\r\nto prove that I think the sincerity of your attachment to me needs no\r\nsuch test, I will make your interest co-operate with your principle: I\r\nwill quarter many of you on the public supply, instead of calling on you\r\nto contribute to it; and, while their whole thoughts are absorbed in\r\npatriotic apprehensions for their country, I will dexterously force upon\r\nothers the favorite objects of the vanity or ambition of their lives.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Good God, Sir, that he should have thought it prudent to have forced\r\nthis contrast upon our attention; that he should triumphantly remind us\r\nof everything that shame should have withheld, and caution would have\r\nburied in oblivion! Will those who stood forth with a parade of\r\ndisinterested patriotism, and vaunted of the _sacrifices_ they had\r\nmade, and the _exposed situation_ they had chosen, in order the\r\nbetter to oppose the friends of Brissot in England--will they thank the\r\nNoble Lord for reminding us how soon these lofty professions dwindled\r\ninto little jobbing pursuits for followers and dependents, as unfit to\r\nfill the offices procured for them, as the offices themselves were unfit\r\nto be created?--Will the train of newly titled alarmists, of\r\nsupernumerary negotiators, of pensioned paymasters, agents and\r\ncommissaries, thank him for remarking to us how profitable their panic\r\nhas been to themselves, and how expensive to their country? What a\r\ncontrast, indeed, do we exhibit!--What! in such an hour as this, at a\r\nmoment pregnant with the national fate, when, pressing as the exigency\r\nmay be, the hard task of squeezing the money from the pockets of an\r\nimpoverished people, from the toil, the drudgery of the shivering poor,\r\nmust make the most practised collector's heart ache while he tears it\r\nfrom them--can it be that people of high rank, and professing high\r\nprinciples, that _they_ or _their families_ should seek to\r\nthrive on the spoils of misery and fatten on the meals wrested from\r\nindustrious poverty? Can it be that that should be the case with the very\r\npersons, who state the _unprecedented peril of the country_ as the\r\n_sole_ cause of their being found in the ministerial ranks? The\r\nConstitution is in danger, religion is in danger, the very existence of\r\nthe nation itself is endangered; all personal and party considerations\r\nought to vanish; the war must be supported by every possible exertion,\r\nand by every possible sacrifice; the people must not murmur at their\r\nburdens, it is for their salvation, their all is at stake. The time is\r\ncome, when all honest and disinterested men should rally round the Throne\r\nas round a standard;--for what? ye honest and disinterested men, to\r\nreceive, for your own private emolument, a portion of those very taxes\r\nwrung from the people on the pretence of saving them from the poverty and\r\ndistress which you say the enemy would inflict, but which you take care\r\nno enemy shall be able to aggravate. Oh! shame! shame! is this a time for\r\nselfish intrigues, and the little dirty traffic for lucre and emolument?\r\nDoes it suit the honor of a gentleman to ask at such a moment? Does it\r\nbecome the honesty of a Minister to grant? Is it intended to confirm the\r\npernicious doctrine, so industriously propagated by many, that all public\r\nmen are impostors, and that every politician has his price? Or even where\r\nthere is no principle in the bosom, why does not prudence hint to the\r\nmercenary and the vain to abstain a while at least, and wait the fitting\r\nof the times? Improvident impatience! Nay, even from those who seem to\r\nhave no direct object of office or profit, what is the language which\r\ntheir actions speak? The Throne is in danger!--'we will support the\r\nThrone; but let us share the smiles of Royalty;'--the order of Nobility\r\nis in danger!--'I will fight for Nobility,' says the Viscount, 'but my\r\nzeal would be much greater if I were made an Earl.' 'Rouse all the\r\nMarquis within me,' exclaims the Earl, 'and the peerage never turned\r\nforth a more undaunted champion in its cause than I shall prove.' 'Stain\r\nmy green riband blue,' cries out the illustrious Knight, 'and the\r\nfountain of honor will have a fast and faithful servant.' What are the\r\npeople to think of our sincerity?--What credit are they to give to our\r\nprofessions?--Is this system to be persevered in? Is there nothing that\r\nwhispers to that Right Honorable Gentleman that the crisis is too big,\r\nthat the times are too gigantic, to be ruled by the little hackneyed and\r\nevery-day means of ordinary corruption?\"\r\n\r\nThe discussions, indeed, during the whole of this Session, were marked by\r\na degree of personal acrimony, which in the present more sensitive times\r\nwould hardly be borne. Mr. Pitt and Mr. Sheridan came, most of all, into\r\ncollision; and the retorts of the Minister not unfrequently proved with\r\nwhat weight the haughty sarcasms of Power may descend even upon the\r\ntempered buckler of Wit.\r\n\r\nIt was in this Session, and on the question of the Treaty with the King\r\nof Sardinia, that Mr. Canning made his first appearance, as an orator, in\r\nthe House. He brought with him a fame, already full of promise, and has\r\nbeen one of the brightest ornaments of the senate and the country ever\r\nsince. From the political faith in which he had been educated, under the\r\nvery eyes of Mr. Sheridan, who had long been the friend of his family,\r\nand at whose house he generally passed his college vacations, the line\r\nthat he was to take in the House of Commons seemed already, according to\r\nthe usual course of events, marked out for him. Mr. Sheridan had, indeed,\r\nwith an eagerness which, however premature, showed the value which he and\r\nothers set upon the alliance, taken occasion in the course of a laudatory\r\ntribute to Mr. Jenkinson, [Footnote: Now Lord Liverpool] on the success\r\nof his first effort in the House, to announce the accession which his own\r\nparty was about to receive, in the talents of another gentleman,--the\r\ncompanion and friend of the young orator who had now distinguished\r\nhimself. Whether this and other friendships, formed by Mr. Canning at the\r\nUniversity, had any share in alienating him from a political creed, which\r\nhe had hitherto, perhaps, adopted rather from habit and authority than\r\nchoice--or, whether he was startled at the idea of appearing for the\r\nfirst time in the world, as the announced pupil and friend of a person\r\nwho, both by the vehemence of his politics and the irregularities of his\r\nlife, had put himself, in some degree, under the ban of public\r\nopinion--or whether, lastly, he saw the difficulties which even genius\r\nlike his would experience, in rising to the full growth of its ambition,\r\nunder the shadowing branches of the Whig aristocracy, and that\r\nsuperseding influence of birth and connections, which had contributed to\r\nkeep even such men as Burke and Sheridan out of the Cabinet--_which_\r\nof these motives it was that now decided the choice of the young\r\npolitical Hercules, between the two paths that equally wooed his\r\nfootsteps, none, perhaps, but himself can fully determine. His decision,\r\nwe know, was in favor of the Minister and Toryism; and, after a friendly\r\nand candid explanation to Sheridan of the reasons and feelings that urged\r\nhim to this step, he entered into terms with Mr. Pitt, and was by him\r\nimmediately brought into Parliament.\r\n\r\nHowever dangerous it might be to exalt such an example into a precedent,\r\nit is questionable whether, in thus resolving to join the ascendant side,\r\nMr. Canning has not conferred a greater benefit on the country than he\r\never would have been able to effect in the ranks of his original friends.\r\nThat Party, which has now so long been the sole depository of the power\r\nof the State, had, in addition to the original narrowness of its\r\nprinciples, contracted all that proud obstinacy, in antiquated error,\r\nwhich is the invariable characteristic of such monopolies; and which,\r\nhowever consonant with its vocation, as the chosen instrument of the\r\nCrown, should have long since _invalided_ it in the service of a\r\nfree and enlightened people. Some infusion of the spirit of the times\r\ninto this body had become necessary, even for its own preservation,--in\r\nthe same manner as the inhalement of youthful breath has been\r\nrecommended, by some physicians, to the infirm and superannuated. This\r\nrenovating inspiration the genius of Mr. Canning has supplied. His first\r\npolitical lessons were derived from sources too sacred to his young\r\nadmiration to be forgotten. He has carried the spirit of these lessons\r\nwith him into the councils which he joined, and by the vigor of the\r\ngraft, which already, indeed, shows itself in the fruits, bids fair to\r\nchange altogether the nature of Toryism.\r\n\r\nAmong the eminent persons summoned as witnesses on the Trial of Horne\r\nTooke, which took place in November of this year, was Mr. Sheridan; and,\r\nas his evidence contains some curious particulars, both with regard to\r\nhimself and the state of political feeling in the year 1790, I shall here\r\ntranscribe a part of it:--\r\n\r\n\"He, (Mr. Sheridan,) said he recollects a meeting to celebrate the\r\nestablishment of liberty in France in the year 1790. Upon that occasion\r\nhe moved a Resolution drawn up the day before by the Whig club. Mr. Horne\r\nTooke, he says, made no objection to his motion, but proposed an\r\namendment. Mr. Tooke stated that an unqualified approbation of the French\r\nRevolution, in the terms moved, might produce an ill effect out of doors,\r\na disposition to a revolution in this country, or, at least, be\r\nmisrepresented to have that object; he adverted to the circumstance of\r\ntheir having all of them national cockades in their hats; he proposed to\r\nadd some qualifying expression to the approbation of the French\r\nRevolution, a declaration of attachment to the principles of our own\r\nConstitution; he said Mr. Tooke spoke in a figurative manner of the\r\nformer Government of France; he described it as a vessel so foul and\r\ndecayed, that no repair could save it from destruction, that in\r\ncontrasting our state with that, he said, thank God, the main timbers of\r\nour Constitution are sound; he had before observed, however, that some\r\nreforms might be necessary; he said that sentiment was received with\r\ngreat disapprobation, and with very rude interruption, insomuch that Lord\r\nStanhope, who was in the chair, interfered; he said it had happened to\r\nhim, in many public meetings, to differ with and oppose the prisoner, and\r\nthat he has frequently seen him received with very considerable marks of\r\ndisapprobation, but he never saw them affect him much; he said that he\r\nhimself objected to Mr. Tooke's amendment; he thinks he withdrew his\r\namendment, and moved it as a separate motion; he said it was then carried\r\nas unanimously as his own motion had been; that original motion and\r\nseparate motion are in these words:--'That this meeting does most\r\ncordially rejoice in the establishment and confirmation of liberty in\r\nFrance; and it beholds with peculiar satisfaction the sentiments of amity\r\nand good will which appear to pervade the people of that country towards\r\nthis kingdom, especially at a time when it is the manifest interest of\r\nboth states that nothing should interrupt the harmony which at present\r\nsubsists between them, and which is so essentially necessary to the\r\nfreedom and happiness, not only of the French nation, but of all mankind.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Tooke wished to add to his motion some qualifying clause, to guard\r\nagainst misunderstanding and misrepresentation:--that there was a wide\r\ndifference between England and France; that in France the vessel was so\r\nfoul and decayed, that no repair could save it from destruction, whereas,\r\nin England, we had a noble and stately vessel, sailing proudly on the\r\nbosom of the ocean; that her main timbers were sound, though it was true,\r\nafter so long a course of years, she might want some repairs. Mr. Tooke's\r\nmotion was,--'That we feel equal satisfaction that the subjects of\r\nEngland, by the virtuous exertions of their ancestors, have not so\r\narduous a task to perform as the French have had, but have only to\r\nmaintain and improve the Constitution which their ancestors have\r\ntransmitted to them.'--This was carried unanimously.\"\r\n\r\nThe trial of Warren Hastings still \"dragged its slow length along,\" and\r\nin the May of this year Mr. Sheridan was called upon for his Reply on the\r\nBegum Charge. It was usual, on these occasions, for the Manager who spoke\r\nto be assisted by one of his brother Managers, whose task it was to carry\r\nthe bag that contained his papers, and to read out whatever Minutes might\r\nbe referred to in the course of the argument. Mr. Michael Angelo Taylor\r\nwas the person who undertook this office for Sheridan; but, on the\r\nmorning of the speech, upon his asking for the bag that he was to carry,\r\nhe was told by Sheridan that there was none--neither bag nor papers.\r\nThey must manage, he said, as well as they could without them;--and when\r\nthe papers were called for, his friend must only put the best countenance\r\nhe could upon it. As for himself \"he would abuse Ned Law--ridicule\r\nPlumer's long orations--make the Court laugh--please the women, and, in\r\nshort, with Taylor's aid would get triumphantly through his task.\" His\r\nopening of the case was listened to with the profoundest attention; but\r\nwhen he came to contrast the evidence of the Commons with that adduced by\r\nHastings, it was not long before the Chancellor interrupted him, with a\r\nrequest that the printed Minutes to which he referred should be read.\r\nSheridan answered that his friend Mr. Taylor would read them; and Mr.\r\nTaylor affected to send for the bag, while the orator begged leave, in\r\nthe meantime, to proceed. Again, however, his statements rendered a\r\nreference to the Minutes necessary, and again he was interrupted by the\r\nChancellor, while an outcry after Mr. Sheridan's bag was raised in all\r\ndirections. At first the blame was laid on the solicitor's clerk--then a\r\nmessenger was dispatched to Mr. Sheridan's house. In the meantime, the\r\norator was proceeding brilliantly and successfully in his argument; and,\r\non some further interruption and expostulation from the Chancellor,\r\nraised his voice and said, in a dignified tone, \"On the part of the\r\nCommons, and as a Manager of this Impeachment, I shall conduct my case as\r\nI think proper. I mean to be correct, and Your Lordships, having the\r\nprinted Minutes before you, will afterwards see whether I am right or\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the bustle produced by the inquiries after the bag, Mr. Fox,\r\nalarmed at the inconvenience which, he feared, the want of it might\r\noccasion Sheridan, ran up from the Managers' room, and demanded eagerly\r\nthe cause of this mistake from Mr. Taylor; who, hiding his mouth with his\r\nhand, whispered him, (in a tone of which they alone, who have heard this\r\ngentleman relate the anecdote, can feel the full humor,) \"The man has no\r\nbag!\"\r\n\r\nThe whole of this characteristic contrivance was evidently intended by\r\nSheridan to raise that sort of surprise at the readiness of his\r\nresources, which it was the favorite triumph of his vanity to create. I\r\nhave it on the authority of Mr. William Smythe, that, previously to the\r\ndelivery of this speech, he passed two or three days alone at Wanstead,\r\nso occupied from morning till night in writing and reading of papers, as\r\nto complain in the evenings that he \"had motes before his eyes.\" This\r\nmixture of real labor with apparent carelessness was, indeed, one of the\r\nmost curious features of his life and character.\r\n\r\nTogether with the political contests of this stormy year, he had also on\r\nhis mind the cares of his new Theatre, which opened on the 21st of April,\r\nwith a prologue, not by himself, as might have been expected, but by his\r\nfriend General Fitzpatrick. He found time, however, to assist in the\r\nrapid manufacture of a little piece called \"The Glorious First of June,\"\r\nwhich was acted immediately after Lord Howe's victory, and of which I\r\nhave found some sketches [Footnote: One of these is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"SCENE I.--Miss _Leake_--Miss _Decamp--Walsh_.\r\n\r\n\"Short dialogue--Nancy persuading Susan to go to the Fair, where there is\r\nan entertainment to be given by the Lord of the Manor--Susan melancholy\r\nbecause Henry, her lover, is at sea with the British Admiral--_Song_\r\n--Her old mother scolds from the cottage--her little brother (_Walsh_)\r\ncomes from the house, with a message--laughs at his sister's fears and\r\nsings--_Trio_.\r\n\r\n\"SCENE II.--_The Fair_\r\n\r\n\"Puppet show--dancing bear--bells--hurdy-gurdy--recruiting party--song\r\nand chorus.\r\n\r\n\"_Ballet_--D'Egville.\r\n\r\n\"Susan says she has no pleasure, and will go and take a solitary walk.\r\n\r\n\"SCENE III.--_Dark Wood._\r\n\r\n\"Susan--gipsy--tells her fortune--recitative and ditty.\r\n\r\n\"SCENE IV.\r\n\r\n\"SEA-FIGHT--hell and the devil!\r\n\r\n\"Henry and Susan meet--Chorus introducing burden,\r\n\r\n\"Rule Britannia.\"\r\n\r\nAmong other occasional trifles of this kind, to which Sheridan\r\ncondescended for the advantage of the theatre, was the pantomime of\r\nRobinson Crusoe, brought out, I believe, in 1781, of which he is\r\nunderstood to have been the author. There was a practical joke in this\r\npantomime, (where, in pulling off a man's boot, the leg was pulled off\r\nwith it,) which the famous Delpini laid claim to as his own, and publicly\r\ncomplained of Sheridan's having stolen it from him. The punsters of the\r\nday said it was claimed as literary property--being \"in usum\r\n_Delpini_.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of these inglorious tasks of the author of The School for\r\nScandal, was the furnishing of the first outline or _Programme_ of\r\n\"The Forty Thieves.\" His brother in law, Ward, supplied the dialogue, and\r\nMr. Colman was employed to season it with an infusion of jokes. The\r\nfollowing is Sheridan's sketch of one of the scenes--\r\n\r\n\"ALI BABA.\r\n\r\n\"Bannister called out of the cavern boldly by his son--comes out and\r\nfalls on the ground a long time, not knowing him--says he would only have\r\ntaken a little gold to Keep off misery and save his son, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Afterwards, when he loads his asses, his son reminds him to be\r\nmoderate--but it was a promise made to thieves--'it gets nearer the\r\nowner, if taken from the stealer'--the son disputes this morality--'they\r\nstole it, _ergo_, they have no right to it; and we steal it from the\r\nstealer, _ergo_, our title is twice as bad as theirs.'\"] in\r\nSheridan's hand-writing,--though the dialogue was, no doubt, supplied (as\r\nMr. Boaden says,) \"by Cobb, or some other such _pedissequus_ of the\r\nDramatic Muse. This piece was written, rehearsed, and acted within three\r\ndays. The first operation of Mr. Sheridan towards it was to order the\r\nmechanist of the theatre to get ready two fleets. It was in vain that\r\nobjections were started to the possibility of equipping these pasteboard\r\narmaments in so short an interval--Lord Chatham's famous order to Lord\r\nAnson was not more peremptory. [Footnote: For the expedition to the coast\r\nof France, after the Convention of Closter seven. When he ordered the\r\nfleet to be equipped, and appointed the time and place of its rendezvous,\r\nLord Anson said it would be impossible to have it prepared so soon. \"It\r\nmay,\" said Mr. Pitt, \"be done, and if the ships are not ready at the time\r\nspecified, I shall signify Your Lordship's neglect to the King, and\r\nimpeach you in the House of Commons.\" This intimation produced the\r\ndesired effect--the ships were ready. See Anecdotes of Lord Chatham,\r\nvol. i] The two fleets were accordingly ready at the time, and the Duke\r\nof Clarence attended the rehearsal of their evolutions. This mixture of\r\nthe cares of the Statesman and the Manager is one of those whimsical\r\npeculiarities that made Sheridan's own life so dramatic, and formed a\r\ncompound altogether too singular ever to occur again.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the following year, (1795,) we find Mr. Sheridan paying\r\nthat sort of tribute to the happiness of a first marriage which is\r\nimplied by the step of entering into a second. The lady to whom he now\r\nunited himself was Miss Esther Jane Ogle, daughter of the Dean of\r\nWinchester, and grand-daughter, by the mother's side, of the former\r\nBishop of Winchester. We have here another proof of the ready mine of\r\nwealth which the theatre opened,--as in gratitude it ought,--to him who\r\nhad endowed, it with such imperishable treasures. The fortune of the lady\r\nbeing five thousand pounds, he added to it fifteen thousand more, which\r\nhe contrived to raise by the sale of Drury-Lane shares; and the whole of\r\nthe sum was subsequently laid out in the purchase from Sir W. Geary of\r\nthe estate of Polesden, in Surrey, near Leatherhead. The Trustees of this\r\nsettlement were Mr. Grey, (now Lord Grey,) and Mr. Whitbread.\r\n\r\nTo a man at the time of life which Sheridan had now attained--four years\r\nbeyond that period, at which Petrarch thought it decorous to leave off\r\nwriting love-verses [Footnote: See his Epistle, \"ad Posteritatem,\" where,\r\nafter lamenting the many years which he had devoted to love, he adds:\r\n\"Mox vero ad _quadragesimum annum_ appropinquans, dum adhuc et\r\ncaloris satis esset,\" &c.]--a union with a young and accomplished girl,\r\nardently devoted to him, must have been like a renewal of his own youth;\r\nand it is, indeed, said by those who were in habits of intimacy with him\r\nat this period, that they had seldom seen his spirits in a state of more\r\nbuoyant vivacity. He passed much of his time at the house of his\r\nfather-in-law near Southampton;--and in sailing about with his lively\r\nbride on the Southampton river, (in a small cutter called the Phaedria,\r\nafter the magic boat in the \"Fairy Queen,\") forgot for a while his debts,\r\nhis theatre, and his politics. It was on one of these occasions that my\r\nfriend Mr. Bowles, who was a frequent companion of his parties,\r\n[Footnote: Among other distinguished persons present at these excursions\r\nwere Mr. Joseph Richardson, Dr. Howley, now Bishop of London, and Mrs.\r\nWilmot, now Lady Dacre, a lady, whose various talents,--not the less\r\ndelightful for being so feminine,--like the group of the Graces, reflect\r\nbeauty on each other.] wrote the following verses, which were much\r\nadmired, as they well deserved to be, by Sheridan, for the sweetness of\r\ntheir thoughts, and the perfect music of their rhythm:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Smooth went our boat upon the summer seas,\r\n     Leaving, (for so it seem'd.) the world behind,\r\n     Its cares, its sounds, its shadows: we reclin'd\r\n   Upon the sunny deck, heard but the breeze\r\n   That o'er us whispering pass'd or idly play'd\r\n     With the lithe flag aloft.--A woodland scene\r\n     On either side drew its slope line of green,\r\n   And hung the water's shining edge with shade.\r\n   Above the woods, Netley! thy ruins pale\r\n     Peer'd, as we pass'd; and Vecta's [1] azure hue\r\n     Beyond the misty castle [2] met the view;\r\n   Where in mid channel hung the scarce-seen sail.\r\n     So all was calm and sunshine as we went\r\n     Cheerily o'er the briny element.\r\n   Oh! were this little boat to us the world,\r\n     As thus we wander'd far from sounds of care,\r\n     Circled with friends and gentle maidens fair,\r\n   Whilst morning airs the waving pendant curl'd,\r\n     How sweet were life's long voyage, till in peace\r\n     We gain'd that haven still, where all things cease!\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Isle of Wight]\r\n[Footnote 2: Kelshot Castle]\r\n\r\nThe events of this year but added fresh impetus to that reaction upon\r\neach other of the Government and the People, which such a system of\r\nmisrule is always sure to produce. Among the worst effects, as I have\r\nalready remarked, of the rigorous policy adopted by the Minister, was the\r\nextremity to which it drove the principles and language of Opposition,\r\nand that sanction which the vehement rebound against oppression of such\r\ninfluencing spirits as Fox and Sheridan seemed to hold out to the\r\nobscurer and more practical assertors of freedom. This was at no time\r\nmore remarkable than in the present Session, during the discussion of\r\nthose arbitrary measures, the Treason and Sedition Bills, when sparks\r\nwere struck out, in the collision of the two principles, which the\r\ncombustible state of public feeling at the moment rendered not a little\r\nperilous. On the motion that the House should resolve itself into a\r\nCommittee upon the Treason Bill, Mr. Fox said, that \"if Ministers were\r\ndetermined, by means of the corrupt influence they already possessed in\r\nthe two Houses of Parliament, to pass these Bills, in violent opposition\r\nto the declared sense of the great majority of the nation, and they\r\nshould be put in force with all their rigorous provisions,--if his\r\nopinion were asked by the people as to their obedience, he should tell\r\nthem, that it was no longer a question of moral obligation and duty, but\r\nof prudence.\" Mr. Sheridan followed in the bold footsteps of his friend,\r\nand said, that \"if a degraded and oppressed majority of the people\r\napplied to him, he would advise them to acquiesce in those bills only as\r\nlong as resistance was imprudent.\" This language was, of course, visited\r\nwith the heavy reprobation of the Ministry;--but their own partisans had\r\nalready gone as great lengths on the side of absolute power, and it is\r\nthe nature of such extremes to generate each other. Bishop Horsley had\r\npreached the doctrine of passive obedience in the House of Lords,\r\nasserting that \"man's abuse of his delegated authority is to be borne\r\nwith resignation, like any other of God's judgments; and that the\r\nopposition of the individual to the sovereign power is an opposition to\r\nGod's providential arrangements.\" The promotion of the Right Reverend\r\nPrelate that followed, was not likely to abate his zeal in the cause of\r\npower; and, accordingly, we find him in the present session declaring, in\r\nhis place in the House of Lords, that \"the people have nothing to do with\r\nthe laws but to obey them.\"\r\n\r\nThe government, too, had lately given countenance to writers, the absurd\r\nslavishness of whose doctrines would have sunk below contempt, but for\r\nsuch patronage. Among the ablest of them was Arthur Young,--one of those\r\nrenegades from the cause of freedom, who, like the incendiary that set\r\nfire to the Temple with the flame he had stolen from its altar, turn the\r\nfame and the energies which they have acquired in _defence_ of\r\nliberty _against_ her. This gentleman, to whom his situation as\r\nSecretary to the Board of Agriculture afforded facilities for the\r\ncirculation of his political heresies, did not scruple, in one of his\r\npamphlets, roundly to assert, that unequal representation, rotten\r\nboroughs, long parliaments, extravagant courts, selfish Ministers, and\r\ncorrupt majorities, are not only intimately interwoven with the practical\r\nfreedom of England, but, in a great degree, the causes of it.\r\n\r\nBut the most active and notorious of these patronized advocates of the\r\nCourt was Mr. John Reeves,--a person who, in his capacity of President of\r\nthe Association against Republicans and Levellers, had acted as a sort of\r\nSub-minister of Alarm to Mr. Burke. In a pamphlet, entitled \"Thoughts on\r\nthe English Government,\" which Mr. Sheridan brought under the notice of\r\nthe House, as a libel on the Constitution, this pupil of the school of\r\nFilmer advanced the startling doctrine that the Lords and Commons of\r\nEngland derive their existence and authority from the King, and that the\r\nKingly government could go on, in all its functions, without them. This\r\npitiful paradox found an apologist in Mr. Windham, whose chivalry in the\r\nnew cause he had espoused left Mr. Pitt himself at a wondering distance\r\nbehind. His speeches in defence of Reeves, (which are among the proofs\r\nthat remain of that want of equipoise observable in his fine, rather than\r\nsolid, understanding,) have been with a judicious charity towards his\r\nmemory, omitted in the authentic collection by Mr. Amyot.\r\n\r\nWhen such libels against the Constitution were not only promulgated, but\r\nacted upon, on one side, it was to be expected, and hardly, perhaps, to\r\nbe regretted, that the repercussion should be heard loudly and warningly\r\nfrom the other. Mr. Fox, by a subsequent explanation, softened down all\r\nthat was most menacing in his language; and, though the word\r\n\"Resistance,\" at full length, should, like the hand-writing on the wall,\r\nbe reserved for the last intoxication of the Belshazzars of this world, a\r\nletter or two of it may, now and then, glare out upon their eyes, without\r\nproducing any thing worse than a salutary alarm amid their revels. At all\r\nevents, the high and constitutional grounds on which Mr. Fox defended the\r\nexpressions he had hazarded, may well reconcile us to any risk incurred\r\nby their utterance. The tribute to the house of Russell, in the grand and\r\nsimple passage beginning, \"Dear to this country are the descendants of\r\nthe illustrious Russell,\" is as applicable to that Noble family now as it\r\nwas then; and will continue to be so, I trust, as long as a single\r\nvestige of a race, so pledged to the cause of liberty, remains.\r\n\r\nIn one of Mr. Sheridan's speeches on the subject of Reeves's libel, there\r\nare some remarks on the character of the people of England, not only\r\ncandid and just, but, as applied to them at that trying crisis,\r\ninteresting:--\r\n\r\n\"Never was there,\" he said, \"any country in which there was so much\r\nabsence of public principle, and at the same time so many instances of\r\nprivate worth. Never was there so much charity and humanity towards the\r\npoor and the distressed; any act of cruelty or oppression never failed to\r\nexcite a sentiment of general indignation against its authors. It was a\r\ncircumstance peculiarly strange, that though luxury had arrived to such a\r\npitch, it had so little effect in depraving the hearts and destroying the\r\nmorals of people in private life; and almost every day produced some\r\nfresh example of generous feelings and noble exertions of benevolence.\r\nYet amidst these phenomena of private virtue, it was to be remarked, that\r\nthere was an almost total want of public spirit, and a most deplorable\r\ncontempt of public principle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"When Great Britain fell, the case would not be with her as with Rome in\r\nformer times. When Rome fell, she fell by the weight of her own vices.\r\nThe inhabitants were so corrupted and degraded, as to be unworthy of a\r\ncontinuance of prosperity, and incapable to enjoy the blessings of\r\nliberty; their minds were bent to the state in which a reverse of fortune\r\nplaced them. But when Great Britain falls, she will fall with a people\r\nfull of private worth and virtue; she will be ruined by the profligacy of\r\nthe governors, and the security of her inhabitants,--the consequence of\r\nthose pernicious doctrines which have taught her to place a false\r\nconfidence in her strength and freedom, and not to look with distrust and\r\napprehension to the misconduct and corruption of those to whom she has\r\ntrusted the management of her resources.\"\r\n\r\nTo this might have been added, that when Great Britain falls, it will not\r\nbe from either ignorance of her rights, or insensibility to their value,\r\nbut from that want of energy to assert them which a high state of\r\ncivilization produces. The love of ease that luxury brings along with\r\nit,--the selfish and compromising spirit, in which the members of a\r\npolished society countenance each other, and which reverses the principle\r\nof patriotism, by sacrificing public interests to private ones,--the\r\nsubstitution of intellectual for moral excitement, and the repression of\r\nenthusiasm by fastidiousness and ridicule,--these are among the causes\r\nthat undermine a people,--that corrupt in the very act of enlightening\r\nthem; till they become, what a French writer calls \"_esprits exigeans\r\net caracteres complaisans_,\" and the period in which their rights are\r\nbest understood may be that in which they most easily surrender them. It\r\nis, indeed, with the advanced age of free States, as with that of\r\nindividuals,--they improve in the theory of their existence as they grow\r\nunfit for the practice of it; till, at last, deceiving themselves with\r\nthe semblance of rights gone by, and refining upon the forms of their\r\ninstitutions after they have lost the substance, they smoothly sink into\r\nslavery, with the lessons of liberty on their lips.\r\n\r\nBesides the Treason and Sedition Bills, the Suspension of the Habeas\r\nCorpus Act was another of the momentous questions which, in this as well\r\nas the preceding Session, were chosen as points of assault by Mr.\r\nSheridan, and contested with a vigor and reiteration of attack, which,\r\nthough unavailing against the massy majorities of the Minister, yet told\r\nupon public opinion so as to turn even defeats to account.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of the Prince of Wales to the Princess Caroline of Brunswick\r\nhaving taken place in the spring of this year, it was proposed by His\r\nMajesty to Parliament, not only to provide an establishment for their\r\nRoyal Highnesses, but to decide on the best manner of liquidating the\r\ndebts of the Prince, which were calculated at 630,000_l_. On the\r\nsecession of the leading Whigs, in 1792, His Royal Highness had also\r\nseparated himself from Mr. Fox, and held no further intercourse either\r\nwith him or any of his party,--except, occasionally, Mr. Sheridan,--till\r\nso late, I believe, as the year 1798. The effects of this estrangement\r\nare sufficiently observable in the tone of the Opposition throughout the\r\ndebates on the Message of the King. Mr. Grey said, that he would not\r\noppose the granting of an establishment to the Prince equal to that of\r\nhis ancestors; but neither would he consent to the payment of his debts\r\nby Parliament. A refusal, he added, to liberate His Royal Highness from\r\nhis embarrassments would certainly prove a mortification; but it would,\r\nat the same time, awaken a just sense of his imprudence. Mr. Fox asked,\r\n\"Was the Prince well advised in applying to that House on the subject of\r\nhis debts, after the promise made in 1787?\"--and Mr. Sheridan, while he\r\nagreed with his friends that the application should not have been made to\r\nParliament, still gave it as his \"positive opinion that the debts ought\r\nto be paid immediately, for the dignity of the country and the situation\r\nof the Prince, who ought not to be seen rolling about the streets, in his\r\nstate-coach, as an insolvent prodigal.\" With respect to the promise given\r\nin 1787, and now violated, that the Prince would not again apply to\r\nParliament for the payment of his debts, Mr. Sheridan, with a\r\ncommunicativeness that seemed hardly prudent, put the House in possession\r\nof some details of the transaction, which, as giving an insight into\r\nRoyal character, are worthy of being extracted.\r\n\r\n\"In 1787, a pledge was given to the House that no more debts should be\r\ncontracted. By that pledge the Prince was bound as much as if he had\r\ngiven it knowingly and voluntarily. To attempt any explanation of it now\r\nwould be unworthy of his honor,--as if he had suffered it to be wrung\r\nfrom him, with a view of afterwards pleading that it was against his\r\nbetter judgment, in order to get rid of it. He then advised the Prince\r\nnot to make any such promise, because it was not to be expected that he\r\ncould himself enforce the details of a system of economy; and, although\r\nhe had men of honor and abilities about him, he was totally unprovided\r\nwith men of business, adequate to such a task. The Prince said he could\r\nnot give such a pledge, and agree at the same time to take back his\r\nestablishment. He (Mr. Sheridan) drew up a plan of retrenchment, which\r\nwas approved of by the Prince, and afterwards by His Majesty; and the\r\nPrince told him that the promise was not to be insisted upon. In the\r\nKing's Message, however, the promise was inserted,--by whose advice he\r\nknew not. He heard it read with surprise, and, on being asked next day by\r\nthe Prince to contradict it in his place, he inquired whether the Prince\r\nhad seen the Message before it was brought down. Being told that it had\r\nbeen read to him, but that he did not understand it as containing a\r\npromise, he declined contradicting it, and told the Prince that he must\r\nabide by it in whatever way it might have been obtained. By the plan\r\nthen settled, Ministers had a check upon the Prince's expenditure, which\r\nthey never exerted, nor enforced adherence to the plan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"While Ministers never interfered to check expenses, of which they could\r\nnot pretend ignorance, the Prince had recourse to means for relieving\r\nhimself from his embarrassments, which ultimately tended to increase\r\nthem. It was attempted to raise a loan for him in foreign countries, a\r\nmeasure which he thought unconstitutional, and put a stop to; and, after\r\na consultation with Lord Loughborough, all the bonds were burnt, although\r\nwith a considerable loss to the Prince. After that, another plan of\r\nretrenchment was proposed, upon which he had frequent consultations with\r\nLord Thurlow, who gave the Prince fair, open, and manly advice. That\r\nNoble Lord told the Prince, that, after the promise he had made, he must\r\nnot think of applying to Parliament;--that he must avoid being of any\r\nparty in politics, but, above all, exposing himself to the suspicion of\r\nbeing influenced in political opinion by his embarrassments;--that the\r\nonly course he could pursue with honor, was to retire from public life\r\nfor a time, and appropriate the greater part of his income to the\r\nliquidation of his debts. This plan was agreed upon in the autum of 1792.\r\nWhy, it might be asked, was it not carried into effect? About that period\r\nhis Royal Highness began to receive unsolicited advice from another\r\nquarter. He was told by Lord Loughborough, both in words and in writing,\r\nthat the plan savored too much of the advice given to M. Egalité, and he\r\ncould guess from what quarter it came. For his own part, he was then of\r\nopinion, that to have avoided meddling in the great political questions\r\nwhich were then coming to be discussed, and to have put his affairs in a\r\ntrain of adjustment, would have better become his high station, and\r\ntended more to secure public respect to it, than the pageantry of\r\nstate-liveries.\"\r\n\r\nThe few occasions on which the name of Mr. Sheridan was again connected\r\nwith literature, after the final investment of his genius in political\r\nspeculations, were such as his fame might have easily dispensed\r\nwith;--and one of them, the forgery of the Shakspeare papers, occurred in\r\nthe course of the present year. Whether it was that he looked over these\r\nmanuscripts with the eye more of a manager than of a critic, and\r\nconsidered rather to what account the belief in their authenticity might\r\nbe turned, than how far it was founded upon internal evidence;--or\r\nwhether, as Mr. Ireland asserts, the standard at which he rated the\r\ngenius of Shakspeare was not so high as to inspire him with a very\r\nwatchful fastidiousness of judgment; certain it is that he was, in some\r\ndegree, the dupe of this remarkable imposture, which, as a lesson to the\r\nself-confidence of criticism, and an exposure of the fallibility of\r\ntaste, ought never to be forgotten in literary history.\r\n\r\nThe immediate payment of 300_l_. and a moiety of the profits for the\r\nfirst sixty nights, were the terms upon which Mr. Sheridan purchased the\r\nplay of Vortigern from the Irelands. The latter part of the conditions\r\nwas voided the first night; and, though it is more than probable that a\r\ngenuine tragedy of Shakspeare, if presented under similar circumstances,\r\nwould have shared the same fate, the public enjoyed the credit of\r\ndetecting and condemning a counterfeit, which had passed current through\r\nsome of the most learned and tasteful hands of the day. It is but\r\njustice, however, to Mr. Sheridan to add, that, according to the account\r\nof Ireland himself, he was not altogether without misgivings during his\r\nperusal of the manuscripts, and that his name does not appear among the\r\nsignatures to that attestation of their authenticity which his friend Dr.\r\nParr drew up, and was himself the first to sign. The curious statement of\r\nMr. Ireland, with respect to Sheridan's want of enthusiasm for\r\nShakspeare, receives some confirmation from the testimony of Mr. Boaden,\r\nthe biographer of Kemble, who tells us that \"Kemble frequently expressed\r\nto him his wonder that Sheridan should trouble himself _so little_\r\nabout Shakspeare.\" This peculiarity of taste,--if it really existed to\r\nthe degree that these two authorities would lead us to infer,--affords a\r\nremarkable coincidence with the opinions of another illustrious genius,\r\nlately lost to the world, whose admiration of the great Demiurge of the\r\nDrama was leavened with the same sort of heresy.\r\n\r\nIn the January of this year, Mr. William Stone--the brother of the\r\ngentleman whose letter from Paris has been given in a preceding\r\nChapter--was tried upon a charge of High Treason, and Mr. Sheridan was\r\namong the witnesses summoned for the prosecution. He had already in the\r\nyear 1794, in consequence of a reference from Mr. Stone himself, been\r\nexamined before the Privy Council, relative to a conversation which he\r\nhad held with that gentleman, and, on the day after his examination, had,\r\nat the request of Mr. Dundas, transmited to that Minister in writing the\r\nparticulars of his testimony before the Council. There is among his\r\npapers a rough draft of this Statement, in comparing which with his\r\nevidence upon the trial in the present year, I find rather a curious\r\nproof of the faithlessness of even the best memories. The object of the\r\nconversation which he had held with Mr. Stone in 1794--and which\r\nconstituted the whole of their intercourse with each other--was a\r\nproposal on the part of the latter, submitted also to Lord Lauderdale and\r\nothers, to exert his influence in France, through those channels which\r\nhis brother's residence there opened to him, for the purpose of averting\r\nthe threatened invasion of England, by representing to the French rulers\r\nthe utter hopelessness of such an attempt. Mr. Sheridan, on the trial,\r\nafter an ineffectual request to be allowed to refer to his written\r\nStatement, gave the following as part of his recollections of the\r\nconversation:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stone stated that, in order to effect this purpose, he had\r\nendeavored to collect the opinions of several gentlemen, political\r\ncharacters in this country, whose opinions he thought would be of\r\nauthority sufficient to advance his object; that for this purpose he had\r\nhad interviews with different gentlemen; he named Mr. Smith and, I think,\r\none or two more, whose names I do not now recollect. He named some\r\ngentlemen connected with Administration--if the Counsel will remind me of\r\nthe name--\"\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Law, the examining Counsel, remarked, that \"upon the\r\ncross-examination, if the gentlemen knew the circumstance, they would\r\nmention it.\" The cross-examination of Sheridan by Sergeant Adair was as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"You stated in the course of your examination that Mr. Stone said there\r\nwas a gentleman connected with Government, to whom he had made a similar\r\ncommunication, should you recollect the name of that person if you were\r\nreminded of it?--I certainly should.--Was it General Murray?--General\r\nMurray certainly.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, however, it appears from the written Statement in\r\nmy possession, drawn up soon after the conversation in question, that\r\nthis \"gentleman connected with Government,\" so difficult to be\r\nremembered, was no other than the Prime Minister, Mr. Pitt himself. So\r\nlittle is the memory to be relied upon in evidence, particularly when\r\nabsolved from responsibility by the commission of its deposit to writing.\r\nThe conduct of Mr. Sheridan throughout this transaction appears to have\r\nbeen sensible and cautious. That he was satisfied with it himself may be\r\ncollected from the conclusion of his letter to Mr. Dundas:--\"Under the\r\ncircumstances in which the application, (from Mr. Dundas,) has been made\r\nto me, I have thought it equally a matter of respect to that application\r\nand of respect to myself, as well as of justice to the person under\r\nsuspicion, to give this relation more in detail than at first perhaps\r\nmight appear necessary. My own conduct in the matter not being in\r\nquestion, I can only say that were a similar case to occur, I think I\r\nshould act in every circumstance precisely in the manner I did on this\r\noccasion.\"\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary exertions of Mr. Sheridan this year, though various and\r\nactive, were chiefly upon subordinate questions; and, except in the\r\ninstance of Mr. Fox's Motion of Censure upon Ministers for advancing\r\nmoney to the Emperor without the consent of Parliament, were not\r\ndistinguished by any signal or sustained displays of eloquence. The grand\r\nquestions, indeed, connected with the liberty of the subject, had been so\r\nhotly contested, that but few new grounds were left on which to renew the\r\nconflict. Events, however,--the only teachers of the great mass of\r\nmankind,--were beginning to effect what eloquence had in vain attempted.\r\nThe people of England, though generally eager for war, are seldom long in\r\ndiscovering that \"the cup but sparkles near the brim;\" and in the\r\noccurrences of the following year they were made to taste the full\r\nbitterness of the draught. An alarm for the solvency of the Bank, an\r\nimpending invasion, a mutiny in the fleet, and an organized rebellion in\r\nIreland,--such were the fruits of four years' warfare, and they were\r\nenough to startle even the most sanguine and precipitate into reflection.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Mr. Sheridan on the breaking out of the Mutiny at the Nore\r\nis too well known and appreciated to require any illustration here. It is\r\nplaced to his credit on the page of history, and was one of the happiest\r\nimpulses of good feeling and good sense combined, that ever public man\r\nacted upon in a situation demanding so much of both. The patriotic\r\npromptitude of his interference was even more striking than it appears in\r\nthe record of his parliamentary labors; for, as I have heard at but one\r\nremove from his own authority, while the Ministry were yet hesitating as\r\nto the steps they should take, he went to Mr. Dundas and said.--\"My\r\nadvice is that you cut the buoys on the river--send Sir Charles Grey down\r\nto the coast, and set a price on Parker's head. If the Administration\r\ntake this advice instantly, they ill save the country--if not, they will\r\nlose it; and, on their refusal, I will impeach them in the House of\r\nCommons this very evening.\"\r\n\r\nWithout dwelling on the contrast which is so often drawn--less with a\r\nview to elevate Sheridan than to depreciate his party--between the\r\nconduct of himself and his friends at this fearful crisis, it is\r\nimpossible not to concede that, on the scale of public spirit, he rose as\r\nfar superior to them as the great claims of the general safety transcend\r\nall personal considerations and all party ties. It was, indeed, a rare\r\ntriumph of temper and sagacity. With less temper, he would have seen in\r\nthis awful peril but an occasion of triumph over the Minister whom he had\r\nso long been struggling to overturn--and, with less sagacity, he would\r\nhave thrown away the golden opportunity of establishing himself for ever\r\nin the affections and the memories of Englishmen, as one whose heart was\r\nin the common-weal, whatever might be his opinions, and who, in the\r\nmoment of peril, could sink the partisan in the patriot.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had performed this exemplary duty, he joined Mr. Fox and\r\nthe rest of his friends who had seceded from Parliament about a week\r\nbefore, on the very day after the rejection of Mr. Grey's motion for a\r\nreform. This step, which was intended to create a strong sensation, by\r\nhoisting, as it were, the signal of despair to the country, was followed\r\nby no such striking effects, and left little behind but a question as to\r\nits prudence and patriotism. The public saw, however, with pleasure, that\r\nthere were still a few champions of the constitution, who did not \"leave\r\nher fair side all unguarded\" in this extremity. Mr. Tierney, among\r\nothers, remained at his post, encountering Mr. Pitt on financial\r\nquestions with a vigor and address to which the latter had been hitherto\r\nunaccustomed, and perfecting by practice that shrewd power of analysis,\r\nwhich has made him so formidable a sifter of ministerial sophistries ever\r\nsince. Sir Francis Burdett, too, was just then entering into his noble\r\ncareer of patriotism; and, like the youthful servant of the temple in\r\nEuripides, was aiming his first shafts at those unclean birds, that\r\nsettle within the sanctuary of the Constitution and sully its treasures:--\r\n\r\n[Greek:\r\n\"ptaenon t'agalas\r\nA blaptusae\r\nSemn' anathaemata\"]\r\n\r\nBy a letter from the Earl of Moira to Col. M'Mahon in the summer of this\r\nyear it appears, that in consequence of the calamitous state of the\r\ncountry, a plan had been in agitation among some members of the House of\r\nCommons, who had hitherto supported the measures of the Minister, to form\r\nan entirely new Administration, of which the Noble Earl was to be the\r\nhead, and from which both Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox, as equally obnoxious to\r\nthe public, were to be excluded. The only materials that appear to have\r\nbeen forthcoming for this new Cabinet were Lord Moira himself, Lord\r\nThurlow, and Sir William Pulteney--the last of whom it was intended to\r\nmake Chancellor of the Exchequer. Such a tottering balance of parties,\r\nhowever, could not have been long maintained; and its relapse, after a\r\nshort interval, into Toryism, would but have added to the triumph of Mr.\r\nPitt, and increased his power. Accordingly Lord Moira, who saw from the\r\nbeginning the delicacy and difficulty of the task, wisely abandoned it.\r\nThe share that Mr. Sheridan had in this transaction is too honorable to\r\nhim not to be recorded, and the particulars cannot be better given than\r\nin Lord Moira's own words:--\r\n\r\n\"You say that Mr. Sheridan has been traduced, as wishing to abandon Mr.\r\nFox, and to promote a new Administration. I had accidentally a\r\nconversation with that gentleman at the House of Lords. I remonstrated\r\nstrongly with him against a principle which I heard Mr. Fox's friends\r\nintended to lay down, namely, that they would support a new\r\nAdministration, but that not any of them would take part in it. I\r\nsolemnly declare, upon my honor, that I could not shake Mr. Sheridan's\r\nconviction of the propriety of that determination. He said that he and\r\nMr. Fox's other friends, as well as Mr. Fox himself, would give the most\r\nenergetic support to such an Administration as was in contemplation; but\r\nthat their acceptance of office would appear an acquiescence under the\r\ninjustice of the interdict supposed to be fixed upon Mr. Fox. I did not\r\nand never can admit the fairness of that argument. But I gained nothing\r\nupon Mr. Sheridan, to whose uprightness in that respect I can therefore\r\nbear the most decisive testimony. Indeed I am ashamed of offering\r\ntestimony, where suspicion ought not to have been conceived.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPLAY OF \"THE STRANGER\"--SPEECHES IN PARLIAMENT.--PIZARRO.--MINISTRY OF\r\nMR. ADDINGTON.--FRENCH INSTITUTE.--NEGOTIATION WITH MR. KEMBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theatrical season of 1798 introduced to the public the German drama\r\nof \"The Stranger,\" translated by Mr. Thompson, and (as we are told by\r\nthis gentleman in his preface) altered and improved by Sheridan. There is\r\nreason, however, to believe that the contributions of the latter to the\r\ndialogue were much more considerable than he was perhaps willing to let\r\nthe translator acknowledge. My friend Mr. Rogers has heard him, on two\r\ndifferent occasions, declare that he had written every word of the\r\nStranger from beginning to end; and, as his vanity could not be much\r\ninterested in such a claim, it is possible that there was at least some\r\nvirtual foundation for it.\r\n\r\nThe song introduced in this play, \"I have a silent sorrow here,\" was\r\navowedly written by Sheridan, as the music of it was by the Duchess of\r\nDevonshire--two such names, so brilliant in their respective spheres, as\r\nthe Muses of Song and Verse have seldom had the luck to bring together.\r\nThe originality of these lines has been disputed; and that expedient of\r\nborrowing which their author _ought_ to have been independent of in\r\nevery way, is supposed to have been resorted to by his indolence on this\r\noccasion. Some verses by Tickell are mentioned as having supplied one of\r\nthe best stanzas; but I am inclined to think, from the following\r\ncircumstances, that this theft of Sheridan was of that venial and\r\ndomestic kind--from himself. A writer, who brings forward the accusation\r\nin the Gentleman's Magazine, (vol. lxxi. p. 904,) thus states his\r\ngrounds:--\r\n\r\n\"In a song which I purchased at Bland's music-shop in Holborn in the year\r\n1794, intitled, 'Think not, my love' and professing to be set to music by\r\nThomas Wright. (I conjecture, Organist of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and\r\ncomposer of the pretty Opera called Rusticity.) are the following words:--\r\n\r\n\"The song to which the writer alludes, \"Think not, my love,\" was given to\r\nme, as a genuine production of Mr. Sheridan, by a gentleman nearly\r\nconnected with his family; and I have little doubt of its being one of\r\nthose early love-strains which, in his _tempo de' dolci sospiri_, he\r\naddressed to Miss Linley. As, therefore, it was but \"a feather of his\r\nown\" that the eagle made free with, he may be forgiven. The following is\r\nthe whole of the song:--\r\n\r\n  \"This treasured grief, this loved despair,\r\n    My lot forever be;\r\n  But, dearest, may the pangs I bear\r\n    Be never known to thee!'\r\n\r\n\"Now, without insisting that the opening thought in Mr. Sheridan's famous\r\nsong has been borrowed from that of 'Think not, my love,' the second\r\nverse is manifestly such a theft of the lines I have quoted as entirely\r\noverturns Mr. Sheridan's claim to originality in the matter, unless\r\n'Think not, my love,' has been written by him, and he can be proved to\r\nhave only stolen from himself.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Think not, my love, when secret grief\r\n  Preys on my saddened heart,\r\n  Think not I wish a mean relief.\r\n  Or would from sorrow part.\r\n\r\n  \"Dearly I prize the sighs sincere,\r\n  That my true fondness prove.\r\n  Nor would I wish to check the tear,\r\n  That flows from hapless love!\r\n\r\n  \"Alas! tho' doom'd to hope in vain\r\n  The joys that love requite,\r\n  Yet will I cherish all its pain,\r\n  With sad, but dear delight.\r\n\r\n  \"This treasured grief, this lov'd despair,\r\n  My lot for ever be;\r\n  But, dearest, may the pangs I bear\r\n  Be never known to thee!\"\r\n\r\nAmong the political events of this year, the rebellion of Ireland holds a\r\nmemorable and fearful preeminence. The only redeeming stipulation which\r\nthe Duke of Portland and his brother Alarmists had annexed to their\r\nill-judged Coalition with Mr. Pitt was, that a system of conciliation and\r\njustice should, at last, be adopted towards Ireland. Had they but carried\r\nthus much wisdom into the ministerial ranks with them, their defection\r\nmight have been pardoned for the good it achieved, and, in one respect at\r\nleast, would have resembled the policy of those Missionaries, who join in\r\nthe ceremonies of the Heathen for the purpose of winning him over to the\r\ntruth. On the contrary, however, the usual consequence of such coalitions\r\nwith Power ensued,--the good was absorbed in the evil principle, and, by\r\nthe false hope which it created, but increased the mischief. Lord\r\nFitzwilliam was not only deceived himself, but, still worse to a noble\r\nand benevolent nature like his, was made the instrument of deception and\r\nmockery to millions. His recall, in 1795, assisted by the measures of his\r\nsuccessor, drove Ireland into the rebellion which raged during the\r\npresent year, and of which the causes have been so little removed from\r\nthat hour to this, that if the people have become too wise to look back\r\nto it, as an example, it is assuredly not because their rulers have much\r\nprofited by it as a lesson.\r\n\r\nI am aware that, on the subject of Ireland and her wrongs, I can ill\r\ntrust myself with the task of expressing what I feel, or preserve that\r\nmoderate, historical tone, which it has been my wish to maintain through\r\nthe political opinions of this work. On every other point, my homage to\r\nthe high character of England, and of her institutions, is prompt and\r\ncordial;--on this topic alone, my feelings towards her have been taught\r\nto wear \"the badge of bitterness.\" As a citizen of the world, I would\r\npoint to England as its brightest ornament,--but, as a disfranchised\r\nIrishman, I blush to belong to her. Instead, therefore, of hazarding any\r\nfarther reflections of my own on the causes and character of the\r\nRebellion of 1798, I shall content myself with giving an extract from a\r\nSpeech which Mr. Sheridan delivered on the subject, in the June of that\r\nyear:--\r\n\r\n\"What! when conciliation was held out to the people of Ireland, was there\r\nany discontent? When the government of Ireland was agreeable to the\r\npeople, was there any discontent? After the prospect of that conciliation\r\nwas taken away,--after Lord Fitzwilliam was recalled,--after the hopes\r\nwhich had been raised were blasted,--when the spirit of the people was\r\nbeaten down, insulted, despised, I will ask any gentleman to point out a\r\nsingle act of conciliation which has emanated from the Government of\r\nIreland? On the contrary; has not that country exhibited one continual\r\nscene of the most grievous oppression, of the most vexatious proceedings;\r\narbitrary punishments inflicted; torture declared necessary by the\r\nhighest authority in the sister-kingdom next to that of the legislature?\r\nAnd do gentlemen say that the indignant spirit which is roused by such\r\nexercise of government is unprovoked? Is this conciliation? Is this\r\nlenity? Has everything been done to avert the evils of rebellion? It is\r\nthe fashion to say, and the Address holds the same language, that the\r\nrebellion which now rages in the sister-kingdom has been owing to the\r\nmachinations of 'wicked men.' Agreeing to the amendment proposed, it was\r\nmy first intention to move that these words should be omitted. But, Sir,\r\nthe fact they assert is true. It is, indeed, to the measures of wicked\r\nmen that the deplorable state of Ireland is to be imputed. It is to those\r\nwicked Ministers who have broken the promises they held out, who betrayed\r\nthe party they seduced into their views, to be the instruments of the\r\nfoulest treachery that ever was practised against any people. It is to\r\nthose wicked Ministers who have given up that devoted country to\r\nplunder,--resigned it a prey to this faction, by which it has so long\r\nbeen trampled upon, and abandoned it to every species of insult and\r\noppression by which a country was ever overwhelmed, or the spirit of a\r\npeople insulted, that we owe the miseries into which Ireland is plunged,\r\nand the dangers by which England is threatened. These evils are the\r\ndoings of wicked Ministers, and applied to them, the language of the\r\nAddress records a fatal and melancholy truth.\"\r\n\r\nThe popularity which the conduct of Mr. Sheridan, on the occasion of the\r\nMutiny, had acquired for him,--everywhere but among his own immediate\r\nparty,--seems to have produced a sort of thaw in the rigor of his\r\nopposition to Government; and the language which he now began to hold,\r\nwith respect to the power and principles of France, was such as procured\r\nfor him, more than once in the course of the present Session, the\r\nunaccustomed tribute of compliments from the Treasury-bench. Without, in\r\nthe least degree, questioning his sincerity in this change of tone, it\r\nmay be remarked, that the most watchful observer of the tide of public\r\nopinion could not have taken it at the turn more seasonably or skilfully.\r\nThere was, indeed, just at this time a sensible change in the feeling of\r\nthe country. The dangers to which it had been reduced were great, but the\r\ncrisis seemed over. The new wings lent to Credit by the paper-currency,\r\n--the return of the navy to discipline and victory,--the disenchantment\r\nthat had taken place with respect to French principles, and the growing\r\npersuasion, since strengthened into conviction, that the world has never\r\ncommitted a more gross mistake than in looking to the French as teachers\r\nof liberty,--the insulting reception of the late pacific overtures at\r\nLisle, and that never-failing appeal to the pride and spirit of\r\nEnglishmen, which a threat of invading their sacred shore brings with\r\nit,--all these causes concurred, at this moment, to rally the people of\r\nEngland round the Government, and enabled the Minister to extract from\r\nthe very mischiefs which himself had created the spirit of all others\r\nmost competent to bear and surmount them. Such is the elasticity of a\r\nfree country, however, for the moment, misgoverned,--and the only glory\r\ndue to the Minister under whom such a people, in spite of misgovernment,\r\nflourishes, is that of having proved, by the experiment, how difficult it\r\nis to ruin them.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Sheridan took these popular opportunities of occasionally\r\nappearing before the public, Mr. Fox persevered, with but little\r\ninterruption, in his plan of secession from Parliament altogether. From\r\nthe beginning of the Session of this year, when, at the instance of his\r\nconstituents, he appeared in his place to oppose the Assessed Taxes Bill,\r\ntill the month of February, 1800, he raised his voice in the House but\r\nupon two questions,--each \"dignus vindice,\"--the Abolition of the\r\nSlave-Trade, and a Change of System in Ireland. He had thrown into his\r\nopposition too much real feeling and earnestness to be able, like\r\nSheridan, to soften it down, or shape it to the passing temper of the\r\ntimes. In the harbor of private life alone could that swell subside; and,\r\nhowever the country missed his warning eloquence, there is little doubt\r\nthat his own mind and heart were gainers by a retirement, in which he had\r\nleisure to \"prune the ruffled wings\" of his benevolent spirit,--to\r\nexchange the ambition of being great for that of being useful, and to\r\nlisten, in the stillness of retreat, to the lessons of a mild wisdom, of\r\nwhich, had his life been prolonged, his country would have felt the full\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nFrom one of Sheridan's speeches at this time we find that the change\r\nwhich had lately taken place in his public conduct had given rise to some\r\nunworthy imputations upon his motives. There are few things less politic\r\nin an eminent public man than a too great readiness to answer accusations\r\nagainst his character. For, as he is, in general, more extensively read\r\nor heard than his accusers, the first intimation, in most cases, that the\r\npublic receives of any charge against him will be from his own answer to\r\nit. Neither does the evil rest here;--for the calumny remains embalmed in\r\nthe defence, long after its own ephemeral life is gone. To this unlucky\r\nsort of sensitiveness Mr. Sheridan was but too much disposed to give way,\r\nand accordingly has been himself the chronicler of many charges against\r\nhim, of which we should have been otherwise wholly ignorant. Of this\r\nnature were the imputations founded on his alleged misunderstanding with\r\nthe Duke of Portland, in 1789, to which I have already made some\r\nallusion, and of which we should have known nothing but for his own\r\nnotice of it. His vindication of himself, in 1795, from the suspicion of\r\nbeing actuated by self-interest, in his connection with the Prince, or of\r\nhaving received from him, (to use his own expressions,) \"so much as the\r\npresent of a horse or a picture,\" is another instance of the same kind,\r\nwhere he has given substance and perpetuity to rumor, and marked out the\r\ntrack of an obscure calumny, which would otherwise have been forgotten.\r\nAt the period immediately under our consideration he has equally enabled\r\nus to collect, from his gratuitous defence of himself, that the line\r\nlately taken by him in Parliament, on the great questions of the Mutiny\r\nand Invasion, had given rise to suspicions of his political steadiness,\r\nand to rumors of his approaching separation from Mr. Fox.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry,\" he said, on one occasion, \"that it is hardly possible for\r\nany man to speak in this House, and to obtain credit for speaking from a\r\nprinciple of public spirit; that no man can oppose a Minister without\r\nbeing accused of faction, and none, who usually opposed, can support a\r\nMinister, or lend him assistance in anything, without being accused of\r\ndoing so from interested motives. I am not such a coxcomb as to say, that\r\nit is of much importance what part I may take; or that it is essential\r\nthat I should divide a little popularity, or some emolument, with the\r\nministers of the Crown; nor am I so vain as to imagine, that my services\r\nmight be solicited. Certainly they have not. That might have arisen from\r\nwant of importance in myself, or from others, whom I have been in the\r\ngeneral habit of opposing, conceiving that I was not likely either to\r\ngive up my general sentiments, or my personal attachments. However that\r\nmay be, certain it is, they never have made any attempt to apply to me\r\nfor my assistance.\"\r\n\r\nIn reviewing his parliamentary exertions during this year, it would be\r\ninjustice to pass over his speech on the Assessed Taxes Bill, in which,\r\namong other fine passages, the following vehement burst of eloquence\r\noccurs:\r\n\r\n\"But we have gained, forsooth, several ships by the victory of the First\r\nof June,--by the capture of Toulon,--by the acquisition of those\r\ncharnel-houses in the West Indies, in which 50,000 men have been lost to\r\nthis country. Consider the price which has been paid for these successes.\r\nFor these boasted successes, I will say, give me back the blood of\r\nEnglishmen which has been shed in this fatal Contest.--give me back the\r\n250 millions of debt which it has occasioned.--give me back the honor of\r\nthe country which has been tarnished,--give me back the credit of the\r\ncountry, which has been destroyed,--give me back the solidity of the Bank\r\nof England, which has been overthrown; the attachment of the people to\r\ntheir ancient Constitution, which has been shaken by acts of oppression\r\nand tyrannical laws,--give me back the kingdom of Ireland, the connection\r\nof which is endangered by a cruel and outrageous system of military\r\ncoercion,--give me back that pledge of eternal war, which must be\r\nattended with inevitable ruin !\"\r\n\r\nThe great success which had attended The Stranger, and the still\r\nincreasing taste for the German Drama, induced Mr. Sheridan, in the\r\npresent year, to embark his fame even still more responsibly in a venture\r\nto the same romantic shores. The play of Pizarro was brought out on the\r\n24th of May, 1799. The heroic interest of the plot, the splendor of the\r\npageantry, and some skilful appeals to public feeling in the dialogue,\r\nobtained for it at once a popularity which has seldom been equalled. As\r\nfar, indeed, as multiplied representations and editions are a proof of\r\nsuccess, the legitimate issue of his Muse might well have been jealous of\r\nthe fame and fortune of their spurious German relative. When the author\r\nof the Critic made Puff say, \"Now for my magnificence,--my noise and my\r\nprocession!\" he little anticipated the illustration which, in twenty\r\nyears afterwards, his own example would afford to that ridicule. Not that\r\nin pageantry, when tastefully and subordinately introduced, there is any\r\nthing to which criticism can fairly object:--it is the dialogue of this\r\nplay that is unworthy of its author, and ought never, from either motives\r\nof profit or the vanity of success, to have been coupled with his name.\r\nThe style in which it is written belongs neither to verse nor prose, but\r\nis a sort of amphibious native of both,--neither gliding gracefully\r\nthrough the former element, nor walking steadily on the other. In order\r\nto give pomp to the language, inversion is substituted for metre; and one\r\nof the worst faults of poetry, a superfluity of epithet, is adopted,\r\nwithout that harmony which alone makes it venial or tolerable.\r\n\r\nIt is some relief however, to discover, from the manuscripts in my\r\npossession, that Mr. Sheridan's responsibility for the defects of Pizarro\r\nis not very much greater than his claim to a share in its merits. In the\r\nplot, and the arrangement of the scenes, it is well known, there is but\r\nlittle alteration from the German original. The omission of the comic\r\nscene of Diego, which Kotzebue himself intended to omit,--the judicious\r\nsuppression of Elvira's love for Alonzo,--the introduction, so striking\r\nin representation, of Rolla's passage across the bridge, and the\r\nre-appearance of Elvira in the habit of a nun, form, I believe, the only\r\nimportant points in which the play of Mr. Sheridan deviates from the\r\nstructure of the original drama. With respect to the dialogue, his share\r\nin its composition is reducible to a compass not much more considerable.\r\nA few speeches, and a few short scenes, re-written, constitute almost the\r\nwhole of the contribution he has furnished to it. The manuscript-\r\ntranslation, or rather imitation, of the \"Spaniards in Pern,\"\r\nwhich he used as the ground-work of Pizarro, has been preserved among his\r\npapers:--and, so convenient was it to his indolence to take the style as\r\nhe found it, that, except, as I have said, in a few speeches and scenes,\r\nwhich might be easily enumerated, he adopted, with scarcely any\r\nalteration, the exact words of the translator, whose taste, therefore,\r\n(whoever he may have been,) is answerable for the spirit and style of\r\nthree-fourths of the dialogue. Even that scene where Cora describes the\r\n\"white buds\" and \"crimson blossoms\" of her infant's teeth, which I have\r\noften heard cited as a specimen of Sheridan's false ornament, is indebted\r\nto this unknown paraphrast for the whole of its embroidery.\r\n\r\nBut though he is found to be innocent of much of the contraband matter,\r\nwith which his co-partner in this work had already vitiated it, his own\r\ncontributions to the dialogue are not of a much higher or purer order. He\r\nseems to have written down, to the model before him, and to have been\r\ninspired by nothing but an emulation of its faults. His style,\r\naccordingly, is kept hovering in the same sort of limbo, between blank\r\nverse and prose,--while his thoughts and images, however shining and\r\neffective on the stage, are like the diamonds of theatrical royalty, and\r\nwill not bear inspection off it. The scene between Alonzo and Pizarro, in\r\nthe third act, is one of those almost entirely rewritten by Sheridan; and\r\nthe following medley group of personifications affords a specimen of the\r\nstyle to which his taste could descend:--\r\n\r\n\"Then would I point out to him where now, in clustered villages, they\r\nlive like brethren, social and confiding, while through the burning day\r\nContent sits basking on the cheek of Toil, till laughing Pastime leads\r\nthem to the hour of rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe celebrated harangue of Rolla to the Peruvians, into which Kemble used\r\nto infuse such heroic dignity, is an amplification of the following\r\nsentences of the original, as I find them given in Lewis's manuscript\r\ntranslation of the play:--\r\n\r\n\"_Rolla_. You Spaniards fight for gold; we for our country.\r\n\r\n\"_Alonzo_. They follow an adventurer to the field; we a monarch whom\r\nwe love.\r\n\r\n\"_Atalib_. And a god whom we adore!\"\r\n\r\nThis speech, to whose popular sentiments the play owed much of its\r\nsuccess, was chiefly made up by Sheridan of loans from his own oratory.\r\nThe image of the Vulture and the Lamb was taken, as I have already\r\nremarked, from a passage in his speech on the trial of Hastings;--and he\r\nhad, on the subject of Invasion, in the preceding year, (1798,) delivered\r\nmore than once the substance of those patriotic sentiments, which were\r\nnow so spirit-stirring in the mouth of Rolla. For instance, on the King's\r\nMessage relative to preparation for Invasion:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Directory may instruct their guards to make the fairest professions\r\nof how their army is to act; but of these professions surely not one can\r\nbe believed. The victorious Buonaparte may say that he comes like a\r\nminister of grace, with no other purpose than to give peace to the\r\ncottager, to restore citizens to their rights, to establish real freedom,\r\nand a liberal and humane government. But can there be an Englishman so\r\nstupid, so besotted, so befooled, as to give a moment's credit to such\r\nridiculous professions? ... What, then, is their object? They come for\r\nwhat they really want: they come for ships, for commerce, for credit, and\r\nfor capital. Yes; they come for the sinews, the bones--for the marrow and\r\nthe very heart's blood of Great Britain. But let us examine what we are\r\nto purchase at this price. Liberty, it appears, is now their staple\r\ncommodity: but attend, I say, and examine how little of real liberty they\r\nthemselves enjoy, who are so forward and prodigal in bestowing it on\r\nothers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe speech of Rolla in the prison-scene is also an interpolation of his\r\nown,--Kotzebue having, far more judiciously, (considering the unfitness\r\nof the moment for a _tirade_,) condensed the reflections of Rolla\r\ninto the short exclamation, \"Oh, sacred Nature! thou art still true to\r\nthyself,\" and then made him hurry into the prison to his friend.\r\n\r\nOf the translation of this play by Lewis, which has been found among the\r\npapers, Mr. Sheridan does not appear to have made any use;--except in so\r\nfar as it may have suggested to him the idea of writing a song for Cora,\r\nof which that gentleman had set him an example in a ballad, beginning\r\n\r\n  \"Soft are thy slumbers, soft and sweet,\r\n   Hush thee, hush thee, hush thee, boy.\"\r\n\r\nThe song of Mr. Lewis, however, is introduced, with somewhat less\r\nviolence to probability, at the beginning of the Third Act, where the\r\nwomen are waiting for the tidings of the battle, and when the intrusion\r\nof a ballad from the heroine, though sufficiently unnatural, is not quite\r\nso monstrous as in the situation which Sheridan has chosen for it.\r\n\r\nThe following stanza formed a part of the song, as it was originally\r\nwritten:--\r\n\r\n  'Those eyes that beam'd this morn the light of youth,\r\n  This morn I saw their gentle rays impart\r\n  The day-spring sweet of hope, of love, of truth,\r\n  The pure Aurora of my lover's heart.\r\n  Yet wilt thou rise, oh Sun, and waste thy light,\r\n  While my Alonzo's beams are quench'd in night.'\r\n\r\nThe only question upon which he spoke this year was the important measure\r\nof the Union, which he strenuously and at great length opposed. Like\r\nevery other measure, professing to be for the benefit of Ireland, the\r\nUnion has been left incomplete in the one essential point, without which\r\nthere is no hope of peace or prosperity for that country. As long as\r\nreligious disqualification is left to \"lie like lees at the bottom of\r\nmen's hearts,\" [Footnote: \"It lay like lees at the bottom of men's\r\nhearts; and, if the vessel was but stirred, it would come up.\"--BACON,\r\nHenry VII.] in vain doth the voice of Parliament pronounce the word\r\n\"Union\" to the two Islands--a feeling, deep as the sea that breaks\r\nbetween them, answers back, sullenly, \"Separation.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the remainder of Mr. Sheridan's political career it is my\r\nintention, for many reasons, to proceed with a more rapid step; and\r\nmerely to give the particulars of his public conduct, together with such\r\ndocuments as I can bring to illustrate it, without entering into much\r\ndiscussion or comment on either.\r\n\r\nOf his speeches in 1800,--during which year, on account, perhaps, of the\r\nabsence of Mr. Fox from the House, he was particularly industrious,--I\r\nshall select a few brief specimens for the reader. On the question of the\r\nGrant to the Emperor of Germany, he said:--\r\n\r\n\"I do think, Sir, Jacobin principles never existed much in this country;\r\nand even admitting they had, I say they have been found so hostile to\r\ntrue liberty, that, in proportion as we love it, (and, whatever may be\r\nsaid, I must still consider liberty an inestimable blessing,) we must\r\nhate and detest these principles. But more,--I do not think they even\r\nexist in France. They have there died the best of deaths; a death I am\r\nmore pleased to see than if it had been effected by foreign force,--they\r\nhave stung themselves to death, and died by their own poison.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is a concise and just summary of the causes and effects of\r\nthe French Revolutionary war:--\r\n\r\n\"France, in the beginning of the Revolution, had conceived many romantic\r\nnotions; she was to put an end to war, and produce, by a pure form of\r\ngovernment, a perfectibility of mind which before had never been\r\nrealized. The Monarchs of Europe, seeing the prevalence of these new\r\nprinciples, trembled for their thrones. France, also, perceiving the\r\nhostility of Kings to her projects, supposed she could not be a Republic\r\nwithout the overthrow of thrones. Such has been the regular progress of\r\ncause and effect; but who was the first aggressor, with whom the jealousy\r\nfirst arose, need not now be a matter of discussion. Both the Republic\r\nand the Monarchs who opposed her acted on the same principles;--the\r\nlatter said they must exterminate Jacobins, and the former that they must\r\ndestroy monarchs. From this source have all the calamities of Europe\r\nflowed; and it is now a waste of time and argument to inquire further\r\ninto the subject.\"\r\n\r\nAdverting, in his Speech on the Negotiation with France, to the overtures\r\nthat had been made for a Maritime Truce, he says, with that national\r\nfeeling, which rendered him at this time so popular,--\r\n\r\n\"No consideration for our ally, no hope of advantage to be derived from\r\njoint negotiation, should have induced the English Government to think\r\nfor a moment of interrupting the course of our naval triumphs. This\r\nmeasure, Sir, would have broken the heart of the navy, and would have\r\ndamped all its future exertions. How would our gallant sailors have felt,\r\nwhen, chained to their decks like galley-slaves, they saw the enemy's\r\nvessels sailing under their bows in security, and proceeding, without a\r\npossibility of being molested, to revictual those places which had been\r\nso long blockaded by their astonishing skill, perseverance, and valor? We\r\nnever stood more in need of their services, and their feelings at no time\r\ndeserved to be more studiously consulted. The north of Europe presents to\r\nEngland a most awful and threatening aspect. Without giving an opinion as\r\nto the origin of these hostile dispositions, or pronouncing decidedly\r\nwhether they are wholly ill-founded, I hesitate not to say, that if they\r\nhave been excited because we have insisted upon enforcing the old\r\nestablished Maritime Law of Europe,--because we stood boldly forth in\r\ndefence of indisputable privileges,--because we have refused to abandon\r\nthe source of our prosperity, the pledge of our security, and the\r\nfoundation of our naval greatness,--they ought to be disregarded or set\r\nat defiance. If we are threatened to be deprived of that which is the\r\ncharter of our existence, which has procured us the commerce of the\r\nworld, and been the means of spreading our glory over every land,--if the\r\nrights and honors of our flag are to be called in question, every risk\r\nshould be run, and every danger braved. Then we should have a legitimate\r\ncause of war;--then the heart of every Briton would burn with\r\nindignation, and his hand be stretched forth in defence of his country.\r\nIf our flag is to be insulted, let us nail it to the top-mast of the\r\nnation; there let it fly while we shed the last drop of our blood in\r\nprotecting it, and let it be degraded only when the nation itself is\r\noverwhelmed.\"\r\n\r\nHe thus ridicules, in the same speech, the etiquette that had been\r\nobserved in the selection of the ministers who were to confer with M.\r\nOtto:--\r\n\r\n\"This stiff-necked policy shows insincerity. I see Mr. Napean and Mr.\r\nHammond also appointed to confer with M. Otto, because they are of the\r\nsame rank. Is not this as absurd as if Lord Whitworth were to be sent to\r\nPetersburgh, and told that he was not to treat but with some gentleman of\r\nsix feet high, and as handsome as himself? Sir, I repeat, that this is a\r\nstiff-necked policy, when the lives of thousands are at stake.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following year Mr. Pitt was succeeded, as Prime Minister, by Mr.\r\nAddington. The cause assigned for this unexpected change was the\r\ndifference of opinion that existed between the King and Mr. Pitt, with\r\nrespect to the further enfranchisement of the Catholics of Ireland. To\r\nthis measure the Minister and some of his colleagues considered\r\nthemselves to have been pledged by the Act of Union; but, on finding that\r\nthey could not carry it, against the scruples of their Royal Master,\r\nresigned.\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Pitt so far availed himself of this alleged motive of his\r\nabdication as to found on it rather an indecorous appeal to the\r\nCatholics, in which he courted popularity for himself at the expense of\r\nthat of the King, it was suspected that he had other and less\r\ndisinterested reasons for his conduct. Indeed, while he took merit to\r\nhimself for thus resigning his supremacy, he well knew that he still\r\ncommanded it with \"a falconer's voice,\" and, whenever he pleased, \"could\r\nlure the tassel-gentle back again.\" The facility with which he afterwards\r\nreturned to power, without making any stipulation for the measure now\r\nheld to be essential, proves either that the motive now assigned for his\r\nresignation was false, or that, having sacrificed power to principle in\r\n1801, he took revenge by making principle, in its turn, give way to power\r\nin 1804.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the new Administration, Mr. Sheridan appears to\r\nhave rested on his arms,--having spoken so rarely and briefly throughout\r\nthe Session as not to have furnished to the collector of his speeches a\r\nsingle specimen of oratory worth recording. It is not till the discussion\r\nof the Definitive Treaty, in May, 1802, that he is represented as having\r\nprofessed himself friendly to the existing Ministry:--\"Certainly,\" he\r\nsaid, \"I have in several respects given my testimony in favor of the\r\npresent Ministry,--in nothing more than for making the best peace,\r\nperhaps, they could, after their predecessors had left them in such a\r\ndeplorable situation.\" It was on this occasion, however, that, in\r\nridiculing the understanding supposed to exist between the Ex-minister\r\nand his successor, he left such marks of his wit on the latter as all his\r\nsubsequent friendship could not efface. Among other remarks, full of\r\nhumor, he said,--\r\n\r\n\"I should like to support the present Minister on fair ground; but what\r\nis he? a sort of _outside passenger_,--or rather a man leading the\r\nhorses round a corner, while reins, whip, and all, are in the hands of\r\nthe coachman on the _box_! (_looking at Mr. Pitt's elevated seat,\r\nthree or four benches above that of the Treasury_.) Why not have an\r\nunion of the two Ministers, or, at least, some intelligible connection?\r\nWhen the Ex-minister quitted office, almost all the _subordinate_\r\nMinisters kept their places. How was it that the whole family did not\r\nmove together? Had he only one _covered waggon_ to carry _friends\r\nand goods_? or has he left directions behind him that they may know\r\nwhere to call? I remember a fable of _Aristophanes's_, which is\r\ntranslated from Greek into decent English. I mention this for the country\r\ngentlemen. It is of a man that sat so long on a seat, (about as long,\r\nperhaps, as the Ex-minister did on the Treasury-bench,) that he grew to\r\nit. When Hercules pulled him off, he left all the sitting part of the man\r\nbehind him. The House can make the allusion.\" [Footnote: The following is\r\nanother highly humorous passage from this speech:--\"But let France have\r\ncolonies! Oh, yes! let her have a good trade, that she may be afraid of\r\nwar, says the Learned Member,--that's the way to make Buonaparte love\r\npeace. He has had, to be sure, a sort of military education. He has been\r\nabroad, and is rather _rough company_; but if you put him behind the\r\n_counter_ a little, he will mend exceedingly. When I was reading the\r\nTreaty, I thought all the names of foreign places, viz. Poindicherry,\r\nChandenenagore, Cochin, Martinico, &c, all _cessions_. Not\r\nthey--they are all so many _traps_ and _holes_ to catch this\r\nsilly fellow in, and make a _merchant_ of him! I really think the\r\nbest way upon this principle would be this:--let the merchants of London\r\nopen a _public subscription_, and set him up at once. I hear a great\r\ndeal respecting a certain _statue_ about to be erected to the Right\r\nHonorable Gentleman, (Mr. Pitt,) now in my eye, at a great expense. Send\r\nall that money over to the First Consul, and give him, what you talk of\r\nso much, _Capital_, to begin trade with. I hope the Right Honorable\r\nGentleman over the way will, like the First Consul, refuse a statue for\r\nthe present, and postpone it as a work to posterity. There is no harm,\r\nhowever, in marking out the place. The Right Honorable Gentleman is\r\nmusing, perhaps, on what square, or place, he will choose for its\r\nerection. I recommend the _Bank of England_. Now for the material.\r\nNot gold: no, no!--he has not left enough of it. I should, however,\r\npropose _papier mache_ and old banknotes.\"]\r\n\r\nWe have here an instance, in addition to the many which I have remarked,\r\nof his adroitness, not only in laying claim to all _waifs_ of wit,\r\n\"_ubi non apparebat dominus,_\" but in stealing the wit himself,\r\nwherever he could find it. This happy application of the fable of\r\nHercules and Theseus to the Ministry had been first made by Gilbert\r\nWakefield, in a Letter to Mr. Fox, which the latter read to Sheridan a\r\nfew days before the Debate; and the only remark that Sheridan made, on\r\nhearing it, was, \"What an odd pedantic fancy!\" But the wit knew well the\r\nvalue of the jewel that the pedant had raked up, and lost no time in\r\nturning it to account with all his accustomed skill. The Letter of\r\nWakefield, in which the application of the fable occurs, has been\r\nomitted, I know not why, in his published Correspondence with Mr. Fox:\r\nbut a Letter of Mr. Fox in the same collection, thus alludes to\r\nit:--\"Your story of Theseus is excellent, as applicable to our present\r\nrulers; if you could point out to me where I could find it, I should be\r\nmuch obliged to you. The Scholiast on Aristophanes is too wide a\r\ndescription.\" Mr. Wakefield in answer, says,--\"My Aristophanes, with the\r\nScholia, is not here. If I am right in my recollection, the story\r\nprobably occurs in the Scholia on the Frogs, and would soon be found by\r\nreference to the name of Theseus in Kuster's Index.\"\r\n\r\nAnother instance of this propensity in Sheridan, (which made him a sort\r\nof Catiline in wit, \"covetous of another's wealth, and profuse of his\r\nown,\") occurred during the preceding Session. As he was walking down to\r\nthe House with Sir Philip Francis and another friend, on the day when the\r\nAddress of Thanks on the Peace as moved, Sir Philip Francis pithily\r\nremarked, that \"it was a Peace which every one would be glad of, but no\r\none would be proud of.\" Sheridan, who was in a hurry to get to the House,\r\ndid not appear to attend to the observation;--but, before he had been\r\nmany minutes in his seat, he rose, and, in the course of a short speech,\r\n(evidently made for the purpose of passing his stolen coin as soon as\r\npossible,) said, \"This, Sir, is a peace which every one will be glad of,\r\nbut no one can be proud of.\" [Footnote: A similar theft was his\r\nobservation, that \"half the Debt of England had been incurred in pulling\r\ndown the Bourbons, and the other half in setting them up\"--which pointed\r\nremark he had heard, in conversation, from Sir Arthur Pigott.]\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Dr. Parr to Sheridan, this year, records an\r\ninstance of delicate kindness which renders it well worthy of\r\npreservation:--\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I believe that you and my old pupil Tom feel a lively interest in my\r\nhappiness, and, therefore, I am eager to inform you that, without any\r\nsolicitation, and in the most handsome manner, Sir Francis Burdett has\r\noffered me the rectory of Graffham in Huntingdonshire; that the yearly\r\nvalue of it now amounts to 200_l_., and is capable of considerable\r\nimprovement; that the preferment is tenable with my Northamptonshire\r\nrectory; that the situation is pleasant; and that, by making it my place\r\nof residence, I shall be nearer to my respectable scholar and friend,\r\nEdward Maltby, to the University of Cambridge, and to those Norfolk\r\nconnections which I value most highly.\r\n\r\n\"I am not much skilled in ecclesiastical negotiations; and all my efforts\r\nto avail myself of the very obliging kindness conditionally intended for\r\nme by the Duke of Norfolk completely failed. But the noble friendship of\r\nSir Francis Burdett has set everything right. I cannot refuse myself the\r\ngreat satisfaction of laying before you the concluding passage in Sir\r\nFrancis's letter:--\r\n\r\n\"'I acknowledge that a great additional motive with me to the offer I now\r\nmake Dr. Parr, is, that I believe I cannot do any thing more pleading to\r\nhis friends, Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, and Mr. Knight; and I desire you,\r\nSir, to consider yourself as obliged to them only.'\r\n\r\n\"You will readily conceive, that I was highly gratified with this\r\nstriking and important passage, and that I wish for an early opportunity\r\nof communicating with yourself, and Mr. Fox, and Mr. Knight.\r\n\r\n\"I beg my best compliments to Mrs. Sheridan and Tom; and I have the honor\r\nto be, Dear Sir, your very faithful well-wisher, and respectful, obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\n\"_September 27, Buckden_.\r\n\r\n\"S. PARR.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir Francis sent his own servant to my house at Hilton with the letter;\r\nand my wife, on reading it, desired the servant to bring it to me at\r\nBuckden, near Huntingdon, where I yesterday received it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the Primary Electors of the National\r\nInstitute of France having proposed Haydn, the great composer, and Mr.\r\nSheridan, as candidates for the class of Literature and the Fine Arts,\r\nthe Institute, with a choice not altogether indefensible, elected Haydn.\r\nSome French epigrams on this occurrence, which appeared in the Courier,\r\nseem to have suggested to Sheridan the idea of writing a few English\r\n_jeux-d'esprit_ on the same subject, which were intended for the\r\nnewspapers, but I rather think never appeared. These verses show that he\r\nwas not a little piqued by the decision of the Institute; and the manner\r\nin which he avails himself of his anonymous character to speak of his own\r\nclaims to the distinction, is, it must be owned, less remarkable for\r\nmodesty than for truth. But Vanity, thus in masquerade, may be allowed\r\nsome little license. The following is a specimen:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"The wise decision all admire;\r\n    'Twas just, beyond dispute--\r\n  Sound taste! which, to Apollo's lyre\r\n    Preferred--a German flute!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Kemble, who had been for some time Manager of Drury-Lane Theatre,\r\nwas, in the course of the year 1800-1, tempted, notwithstanding the\r\nknowledge which his situation must have given him of the embarrassed\r\nstate of the concern, to enter into negotiation with Sheridan for the\r\npurchase of a share in the property. How much anxiety the latter felt to\r\nsecure such an associate in the establishment appears strongly from the\r\nfollowing paper, drawn up by him, to accompany the documents submitted to\r\nKemble during the negotiation, and containing some particulars of the\r\nproperty of Drury-Lane, which will be found not uninteresting:--\r\n\r\n\"Outline of the Terms on which it is proposed that Mr. Kemble shall\r\npurchase a Quarter in the Property of Drury-Lane Theatre.\r\n\r\n\"I really think there cannot be a negotiation, in matter of purchase and\r\nsale, so evidently for the advantage of both parties, if brought to a\r\nsatisfactory conclusion.\r\n\r\n\"I am decided that the management of the theatre cannot be respected, or\r\nsuccessful, but in the hands of an actual proprietor; and still the\r\nbetter, if he is himself in the profession, and at the head of it. I am\r\ndesirous, therefore, that Mr. Kemble should be a proprietor and manager.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Kemble is the person, of all others, who must naturally be desirous\r\nof both situations. He is at the head of his profession, without a rival;\r\nhe is attached to it, and desirous of elevating its character. He may be\r\nassured of proper respect, &c., while I have the theatre; but I do not\r\nthink he could brook his situation were the property to pass into vulgar\r\nand illiberal hands,--an event which he knows contingencies might\r\nproduce. Laying aside then all affectation of indifference, so common in\r\nmaking bargains, let us set out with acknowledging that it is mutually\r\nour interest to agree, if we can. At the same time, let it be avowed,\r\nthat I must be considered as trying to get as good a price as I can, and\r\nMr. Kemble to buy as cheap as he can. In parting with theatrical\r\nproperty, there is no standard, or measure, to direct the price: the\r\nwhole question is, what are the probable profits, and what is such a\r\nproportion of them worth?\r\n\r\n\"I bought of Mr. Garrick at the rate of 70,000_l_. for the whole\r\ntheatre. I bought of Mr. Lacey at the rate of 94,000_l_. ditto. I\r\nbought of Dr. Ford at the rate of 86,OOO_l_. ditto. In all these\r\ncases there was a perishable patent, and an expiring lease, each having\r\nto run, at the different periods of the purchases, from ten to twenty\r\nyears only.\r\n\r\n\"All these purchases have undoubtedly answered well; but in the chance of\r\na Third Theatre consisted the risk; and the want of size and\r\naccommodation must have produced it, had the theatres continued as they\r\nwere. But the _great_ and _important feature_ in the present\r\nproperty, and which is never for a moment to be lost sight of, is, that\r\nthe Monopoly is, morally speaking, established for ever, at least as well\r\nas the Monarchy, Constitution, Public Funds, &c.,--as appears by No. 1.\r\nbeing the copy of' The Final Arrangement' signed by the Lord Chamberlain,\r\nby authority of His Majesty, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Bedford,\r\n&c.; and the dormant patent of Covent-Garden, that former terror of\r\nDrury-Lane, is perpetually annexed to the latter. So that the value of\r\nDrury-Lane at present, and in the former sales, is out of all\r\ncomparison,--independently of the new building, superior size, raised\r\nprices, &c., &c. But the incumbrances on the theatre, whose annual charge\r\nmust be paid before there can be any surplus profit, are much greater\r\nthan in Mr. Garrick's time, or on the old theatre afterwards. Undoubtedly\r\nthey are, and very considerably greater; but what is the proportion of\r\nthe receipts? Mr. Garrick realized and left a fortune, of\r\n140,OOO_l_. (having lived, certainly, at no mean expense,) acquired\r\nin ---- years, on an average annual receipt of 25,000_l_. (qu. this?)\r\nOur receipts cannot be stated at less than 60,000_l_. per ann.; and\r\nit is demonstrable that preventing the most palpable frauds and abuses,\r\nwith even a tolerable system of exertion in the management, must bring\r\nit, at the least, to 75,000_l_.; and this estimate does not include\r\nthe advantages to be derived from the new tavern, passages, Chinese hall,\r\n&c.,--an aid to the receipt, respecting the amount of which I am very\r\nsanguine. What then, is the probable profit, and what is a quarter of it\r\nworth? No. 3. is the amount of three seasons' receipts, the only ones on\r\nwhich an attempt at an average could be justifiable. No. 4. is the future\r\nestimate, on a system of exertion and good management. No. 5. the actual\r\nannual incumbrauces. No. 6. the nightly expenses. No. 7. the estimated\r\nprofits. Calculating on which, I demand for a quarter of the property, *\r\n* * *, reserving to myself the existing private boxes, but no more to be\r\ncreated, and the fruit-offices and houses not part of the theatre.\r\n\r\n\"I assume that Mr. Kemble and I agree as to the price, annexing the\r\nfollowing conditions to our agreement:--Mr. Kemble shall have his\r\nengagement as an actor for any rational time he pleases. Mr. Kemble shall\r\nbe manager, with a clear salary of 500 guineas per annum, and * * per\r\ncent. on the clear profits. Mr. Sheridan engages to procure from Messrs.\r\nHammersleys a loan to Mr. Kemble of ten thousand pounds, part of the\r\npurchase-money for four years, for which loan he is content to become\r\ncollateral security, and also to leave his other securities, now in their\r\nhands, in mortgage for the same. And for the payment of the rest of the\r\nmoney, Mr. Sheridan is ready to give Mr. Kemble every facility his\r\ncircumstances will admit of. It is not to be overlooked, that if a\r\nprivate box is also made over to Mr. Kemble, for the whole term of the\r\ntheatre lease, its value cannot be stated at less than 3,500_l_.\r\nIndeed, it might at any time produce to Mr. Kemble, or his assigns,\r\n300_l_ per annum. Vide No. 8. This is a material deduction from the\r\npurchase-money to be paid.\r\n\r\n\"Supposing all this arrangement made, I conceive Mr. Kemble's income\r\nwould stand thus:\r\n\r\n                              £     s.  d.\r\nSalary as an actor,          1050   0   0\r\nIn lieu of benefit,           315   0   0\r\nAs manager,                   525   0   0\r\nPercentage on clear profit,   300   0   0\r\nDividend on quarter-share, [Footnote: \"I put this on the very lowest\r\nspeculation\"]                2500   0   0\r\n                           ______________\r\n\r\n                            £4690   0   0\r\n                           ______________\r\n\r\n\r\nI need not say how soon this would clear the whole of the purchase. With\r\nregard to the title, &c. Mr. Crews and Mr. Pigott are to decide. As to\r\ndebts, the share must be made over to Mr. Kemble free from a claim even;\r\nand for this purpose all demands shall be called in, by public\r\nadvertisement, to be sent to Mr. Kemble's own solicitor. In short, Mr.\r\nCrews shall be satisfied that there does not exist an unsatisfied demand\r\non the theatre, or a possibility of Mr. Kemble being involved in the risk\r\nof a shilling. Mr. Hammersley, or such person as Mr. Kemble and Mr.\r\nSheridan shall agree on, to be Treasurer, and receive and account for the\r\nwhole receipts, pay the charges, trusts, &c.; and, at the close of the\r\nseason, the surplus profits to the proprietors. A clause in case of\r\ndeath, or sale, to give the refusal to each other.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Sheridan to Kemble in answer, as it appears, to\r\nsome complaint or remonstrance from the latter, in his capacity of\r\nManager, is too curiously characteristic of the writer to be omitted:--\r\n\r\n\"DEAR KEMBLE,\r\n\r\n\"If I had not a real good opinion of your principles and intentions upon\r\nall subjects, and a very bad opinion of your nerves and philosophy upon\r\nsome, I should take very ill indeed, the letter I received from you this\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\"That the management of the theatre is a situation capable of becoming\r\n_troublesome_ is information which I do not want, and a discovery\r\nwhich I thought you had made long since.\r\n\r\n\"I should be sorry to write to you gravely on your offer, because I must\r\nconsider it as a nervous flight, which it would be as unfriendly in me to\r\nnotice seriously as it would be in you seriously to have made it.\r\n\r\n\"What I _am_ most serious in is a determination that, while the\r\ntheatre is indebted, and others, for it and for me, are so involved and\r\npressed as they are, I will exert myself, and give every attention and\r\njudgment in my power to the establishment of its interests. In you I\r\nhoped, and do hope, to find an assistant, on principles of liberal and\r\nfriendly confidence,--I mean confidence that should be above touchiness\r\nand reserve, and that should trust to me to estimate the value of that\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n\"If there is any thing amiss in your mind, not arising from the\r\n_troublesomeness_ of your situation, it is childish and unmanly not\r\nto disclose it to me. The frankness with which I have always dealt\r\ntowards you entitles me to expect that you should have done so.\r\n\r\n\"But I have no reason to believe this to be the case; and, attributing\r\nyour letter to a disorder which I know ought not to be indulged, I\r\nprescribe that you shall keep your appointment at the Piazza\r\nCoffee-house, to-morrow at five, and, taking four bottles of claret\r\ninstead of three, to which in sound health you might stint yourself,\r\nforget that you ever wrote the letter, as I shall that I ever received it.\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSTATE OF PARTIES.--OFFER OF A PLACE TO MR. T. SHERIDAN.--RECEIVERSHIP OF\r\nTHE DUCHY OF CORNWALL BESTOWED UPON MR. SHERIDAN.--RETURN OF MR. PITT TO\r\nPOWER.--CATHOLIC QUESTION.--ADMINISTRATION OF LORD GRENVILLE AND MR.\r\nFOX.--DEATH OF MR. FOX.--REPRESENTATION OF WESTMINSTER.--DISMISSION OF\r\nTHE MINISTRY.--THEATRICAL NEGOTIATION.--SPANISH QUESTION.--LETTER TO THE\r\nPRINCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the short interval of peace into which the country was now\r\nlulled,--like a ship becalmed for a moment in the valley between two vast\r\nwaves,--such a change took place in the relative positions and bearings\r\nof the parties that had been so long arrayed against each other, and such\r\nnew boundaries and divisions of opinion were formed, as considerably\r\naltered the map of the political world. While Mr. Pitt lent his sanction\r\nto the new Administration, they, who had made common cause with him in\r\nresigning, violently opposed it; and, while the Ministers were thus\r\nthwarted by those who had hitherto always agreed with them, they were\r\nsupported by those Whigs with whom they had before most vehemently\r\ndiffered. Among this latter class of their friends was, as I have already\r\nremarked, Mr. Sheridan,--who, convinced that the only chance of excluding\r\nMr. Pitt from power lay in strengthening the hands of those who were in\r\npossession, not only gave them the aid of his own name and eloquence, but\r\nendeavored to impress the same views upon Mr. Fox, and exerted his\r\ninfluence also to procure the sanction of Carlton-House in their favor.\r\n\r\nIt cannot, indeed, he doubted that Sheridan, at this time, though still\r\nthe friend of Mr. Fox, had ceased, in a great degree, to be his follower.\r\nTheir views with respect to the renewal of the war were wholly different.\r\nWhile Sheridan joined in the popular feeling against France, and showed\r\nhis knowledge of that great instrument, the Public Mind, by approaching\r\nit only with such themes as suited the martial mood to which it was\r\ntuned, the too confiding spirit of Fox breathed nothing but forbearance\r\nand peace;--and he who, in 1786, had proclaimed the \"natural enmity\" of\r\nEngland and France, as an argument against their commercial intercourse,\r\nnow asked, with the softened tone which time and retirement had taught\r\nhim, \"whether France was for ever to be considered our rival?\" [Footnote:\r\nSpeech on the Address of Thanks in 1803.]\r\n\r\nThe following characteristic note, written by him previously to the\r\ndebate on the Army Estimates, (December 8, 1802,) shows a consciousness\r\nthat the hold which he had once had upon his friend was loosened:--\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SHERIDAN,\r\n\r\n\"I mean to be in town for Monday,--that is, for the Army. As for\r\nto-morrow, it is no matter;--I am _for_ a largish fleet, though\r\nperhaps not quite so large as they mean. Pray, do not be absent Monday,\r\nand let me have a quarter of an hour's conversation before the business\r\nbegins. Remember, I do not wish you to be inconsistent, at any rate.\r\nPitt's opinion by Proxy is ridiculous beyond conception, and I hope you\r\nwill show it in that light. I am very much against your abusing\r\nBonaparte, because I am sure it is impolitic both for the country and\r\nourselves. But, as you please;--only, for God's sake, Peace. [Footnote:\r\nThese last words are an interesting illustration of the line in Mr.\r\nRogers's Verses on this statesman:--\"'Peace,' when he spoke, was ever on\r\nhis tongue\"]\r\n\r\n\"Yours ever\r\n\r\n\"_Tuesday night._\r\n\r\n\"C. J. Fox.\"\r\n\r\nIt was about this period that the writer of these pages had, for the\r\nfirst time, the gratification of meeting Mr. Sheridan, at Donington-Park,\r\nthe seat of the present Marquis of Hastings;--a circumstance which he\r\nrecalls, not only with those lively impressions, that our first\r\nadmiration of genius leaves behind, but with many other dreams of youth\r\nand hope, that still endear to him the mansion where that meeting took\r\nplace, and among which gratitude to its noble owner is the only one,\r\nperhaps, that has not faded. Mr. Sheridan, I remember, was just then\r\nfurnishing a new house, and talked of a plan he had of levying\r\ncontributions on his friends for a library. A set of books from each\r\nwould, he calculated, amply accomplish it, and already the intimation of\r\nhis design had begun to \"breathe a soul into the silent walls.\"\r\n[Footnote: Rogers.] The splendid and well-chosen library of Donington\r\nwas, of course, not slow in furnishing its contingent; and little was it\r\nforeseen into what badges of penury these gifts of friendship would be\r\nconverted at last.\r\n\r\nAs some acknowledgment of the services which Sheridan had rendered to the\r\nMinistry, (though professedly as a tribute to his public character in\r\ngeneral,) Lord St. Vincent, about this time, made an offer to his son,\r\nMr. Thomas Sheridan, of the place of Registrar of the Vice-Admiralty\r\nCourt of Malta,--an office which, during a period of war, is supposed to\r\nbe of considerable emolument. The first impulse of Sheridan, when\r\nconsulted on the proposal, was, as I have heard, not unfavorable to his\r\nson's acceptance of it. But, on considering the new position which he\r\nhad, himself, lately taken in politics, and the inference that might be\r\ndrawn against the independence of his motives, if he submitted to an\r\nobligation which was but too liable to be interpreted, as less a return\r\nfor past services than a _lien_ upon him for future ones, he thought\r\nit safest for his character to sacrifice the advantage, and, desirable as\r\nwas the provision for his son, obliged him to decline it.\r\n\r\nThe following passages of a letter to him from Mrs. Sheridan on this\r\nsubject do the highest honor to her generosity, spirit, and good sense.\r\nThey also confirm what has generally been understood, that the King,\r\nabout this time, sent a most gracious message to Sheridan, expressive of\r\nthe approbation with which he regarded his public conduct, and of the\r\npleasure he should feel in conferring upon him some mark of his Royal\r\nfavor:--\r\n\r\n\"I am more anxious than I can express about Tom's welfare. It is, indeed,\r\nunfortunate that you have been obliged to refuse these things for him,\r\nbut surely there could not be two opinions; yet why will you neglect to\r\nobserve those attentions that honor does not compel you to refuse? Don't\r\nyou know that when once the King takes offence, he was never known to\r\nforgive? I suppose it would be impossible to have your motives explained\r\nto him, because it would touch his weak side, yet any thing is better\r\nthan his attributing your refusal to contempt and indifference. Would to\r\nGod I could bear these necessary losses instead of Tom, particularly as I\r\nso entirely approve of your conduct.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust you will be able to do something positive for Tom about money. I\r\nam willing to make any sacrifice in the world for that purpose, and to\r\nlive in any way whatever. Whatever he has _now ought_ to be certain,\r\nor how will he know how to regulate his expenses?\"\r\n\r\nThe fate, indeed, of young Sheridan was peculiarly tantalizing. Born and\r\nbrought up in the midst of those bright hopes, which so long encircled\r\nhis father's path, he saw them all die away as he became old enough to\r\nprofit by them, leaving difficulty and disappointment, his only\r\ninheritance, behind. Unprovided with any profession by which he could\r\nsecure his own independence, and shut out, as in this instance, from\r\nthose means of advancement, which, it was feared, might compromise the\r\nindependence of his father, he was made the victim even of the\r\ndistinction of his situation, and paid dearly for the glory of being the\r\nson of Sheridan. In the expression of his face, he resembled much his\r\nbeautiful mother, and derived from her also the fatal complaint of which\r\nhe died. His popularity in society was unexampled,--but he knew how to\r\nattach as well as amuse; and, though living chiefly with that class of\r\npersons, who pass over the surface of life, like Camilla over the corn,\r\nwithout leaving any impression of themselves behind, he had manly and\r\nintelligent qualities, that deserved a far better destiny. There are,\r\nindeed, few individuals, whose lives have been so gay and thoughtless,\r\nwhom so many remember with cordiality and interest: and, among the\r\nnumerous instances of discriminating good nature, by which the private\r\nconduct of His Royal Highness the Duke of  York is distinguished, there\r\nare, none that do him more honor than his prompt and efficient kindness\r\nto the interesting family that the son of Sheridan has left behind him.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Declaration of War against France, when an immediate\r\ninvasion was threatened by the enemy, the Heir Apparent, with the true\r\nspirit of an English Prince, came forward to make an offer of his\r\npersonal service to the country. A correspondence upon the subject, it is\r\nwell known, ensued, in the course of which His Royal Highness addressed\r\nletters to Mr. Addington, to the Duke of York, and the King. It has been\r\nsometimes stated that these letters were from the pen of Mr. Sheridan;\r\nbut the first of the series was written by Sir Robert Wilson, and the\r\nremainder by Lord Hutchinson.\r\n\r\nThe death of Joseph Richardson, which took place this year, was felt as\r\nstrongly by Sheridan as any thing _can_ be felt, by those who, in\r\nthe whirl of worldly pursuits, revolve too rapidly round Self, to let any\r\nthing rest long upon their surface. With a fidelity to his old habits of\r\nunpunctuality, at which the shade of Richardson might have smiled, he\r\narrived too late at Bagshot for the funeral of his friend, but succeeded\r\nin persuading the good-natured clergyman  to perform the ceremony over\r\nagain. Mr. John Taylor, a gentleman, whose love of good-fellowship and\r\nwit has made him the welcome associate of some of the brightest men of\r\nhis day, was one of the assistants at this singular scene, and also\r\njoined in the party at the inn at Bedfont afterwards, where Sheridan, it\r\nis said, drained the \"Cup of Memory\" to his friend, till he found\r\noblivion at the bottom.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the session of 1803, that strange diversity of opinions,\r\ninto which the two leading parties were decomposed by the resignation of\r\nMr. Pitt, had given way to new varieties, both of cohesion and\r\nseparation, quite as little to be expected from the natural affinities of\r\nthe ingredients concerned in them. Mr. Pitt, upon perceiving, in those to\r\nwhom he had delegated his power, an inclination to surround themselves\r\nwith such strength from the adverse ranks as would enable them to contest\r\nhis resumption of the trust, had gradually withdrawn the sanction which\r\nhe at first afforded them, and taken his station by the side of the other\r\ntwo parties in opposition, without, however, encumbering himself, in his\r\nviews upon office, with either. By a similar movement, though upon\r\ndifferent principles, Mr. Fox and the Whigs, who had begun by supporting\r\nthe Ministry against the strong War-party of which Lord Grenville and Mr.\r\nWindham were the leaders, now entered into close co-operation with this\r\nnew Opposition, and seemed inclined to forget, both recent and ancient\r\ndifferences in a combined assault upon the tottering Administration of\r\nMr. Addington.\r\n\r\nThe only parties, perhaps, that acted with consistency through these\r\ntransactions, were Mr. Sheridan and the few who followed him on one side,\r\nand Lord Grenville and his friends on the other. The support which the\r\nformer had given to the Ministry,--from a conviction that such was the\r\ntrue policy of his party,--he persevered in, notwithstanding the\r\nsuspicion it drew down upon him, to the last; and, to the last,\r\ndeprecated the connection with the Grenvilles, as entangling his friends\r\nin the same sort of hollow partnership, out of which they had come\r\nbankrupts in character and confidence before. [Footnote: In a letter\r\nwritten this year by Mr. Thomas Sheridan to his father, there is the\r\nfollowing passage--\"I am glad you intended wrong to Lord ----, he is\r\n_quite right_ about politics--reprobates the idea most strongly of\r\nany union with the Granvilles, &c which, he says he sees as Fox's\r\nleaning. 'I agreed with your father perfectly on the subject, when I left\r\nhim in town, but when I saw Charles at St. Ann's Hill, I perceived he was\r\nwrong and obstinate.'\"] In like manner, it must be owned the Opposition,\r\nof which Lord Grenville was the head, held a course direct and\r\nundeviating from beginning to end. Unfettered by those reservations in\r\nfavor of Addington, which so long embarrassed the movements of their\r\nformer leader, they at once started in opposition to the Peace and the\r\nMinistry, and, with not only Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox, but the whole people\r\nof England against them, persevered till they had ranged all these\r\nseveral parties on their side:--nor was it altogether without reason that\r\nthis party afterwards boasted that, if any abandonment of principle had\r\noccurred in the connection between them and the Whigs, the surrender was\r\nassuredly not from their side.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1804, on the death of Lord Elliot, the office of\r\nReceiver of the Duchy of Cornwall, which had been held by that nobleman,\r\nwas bestowed by the Prince of Wales upon Mr. Sheridan, \"as a trifling\r\nproof of that sincere friendship His Royal Highness had always professed\r\nand felt for him through a long series of years.\" His Royal Highness also\r\nadded, in the same communication, the very cordial words, \"I wish to God\r\nit was better worth your acceptance.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Sheridan to Mr. Addington, communicating the\r\nintelligence of this appointment, shows pretty plainly the terms on which\r\nhe not only now stood, but was well inclined to continue, with that\r\nMinister:--\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"_George-Street, Tuesday evening._\r\n\r\n\"Convinced as I am of the sincerity of your good will towards me, I do\r\nnot regard it as an impertinent intrusion to inform you that the Prince\r\nhas, in the most gracious manner, and wholly unsolicited, been pleased to\r\nappoint me to the late Lord Elliot's situation in the Duchy of Cornwall.\r\nI feel a desire to communicate this to you myself, because I feel a\r\nconfidence that you will be glad of it. It has been my pride and pleasure\r\nto have exerted my humble efforts to serve the Prince without ever\r\naccepting the slightest obligation from him; but, in the present case,\r\nand under the present circumstances, I think it would have been really\r\nfalse pride and apparently mischievous affectation to have declined this\r\nmark of His Royal Highness's confidence and favor. I will not disguise\r\nthat, at this peculiar crisis, I am greatly gratified at this event. Had\r\nit been the result of a mean and subservient devotion to the Prince's\r\nevery wish and object, I could neither have respected the gift, the\r\ngiver, nor myself; but when I consider how recently it was my misfortune\r\nto find myself compelled by a sense of duty, stronger than my attachment\r\nto him, wholly to risk the situation I held in his confidence and favor,\r\nand that upon a subject [Footnote: The offer made by the Prince of his\r\npersonal services in 1803,--on which occasion Sheridan coincided with the\r\nviews of Mr. Addington somewhat more than was agreeable to His Royal\r\nHighness.] on which his feelings were so eager and irritable, I cannot\r\nbut regard the increased attention, with which he has since honored me,\r\nas a most gratifying demonstration that he has clearness of judgment and\r\nfirmness of spirit to distinguish the real friends to his true glory and\r\ninterests from the mean and mercenary sycophants, who fear and abhor that\r\nsuch friends should be near him. It is satisfactory to me, also, that\r\nthis appointment gives me the title and opportunity of seeing the Prince,\r\non trying occasions, openly and in the face of day, and puts aside the\r\nmask of mystery and concealment. I trust I need not add, that whatever\r\nsmall portion of fair influence I may at any time possess with the\r\nPrince, it shall be uniformly exerted to promote those feelings of duty\r\nand affection towards their Majesties, which, though seemingly\r\ninterrupted by adverse circumstances, I am sure are in his heart warm and\r\nunalterable--and, as far as I may presume, that general concord\r\nthroughout his illustrious family, which must be looked to by every\r\nhonest subject, as an essential part of the public strength at this\r\nmomentous period. I have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem,\r\n\r\n\"Your obedient Servant,\r\n\r\n\"_Right Hon. Henry Addington_.\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\nThe same views that influenced Mr. Sheridan, Lord Moira, and others, in\r\nsupporting an administration which, with all its defects, they considered\r\npreferable to a relapse into the hands of Mr. Pitt, had led Mr. Tierney,\r\nat the close of the last Session, to confer upon it a still more\r\nefficient sanction, by enrolling himself in its ranks as Treasurer of the\r\nNavy. In the early part of the present year, another ornament of the Whig\r\nparty, Mr. Erskine, was on the point of following in the same footsteps,\r\nby accepting, from Mr. Addington, the office of Attorney-General. He had,\r\nindeed, proceeded so far in his intention as to submit the overtures of\r\nthe Minister to the consideration of the Prince, in a letter which was\r\ntransmitted to his Royal Highness by Sheridan. The answer of the Prince,\r\nconveyed also through Sheridan, while it expressed the most friendly\r\nfeelings towards Erskine, declined, at the same time, giving any opinion\r\nas to either his acceptance or refusal of the office of Attorney-General,\r\nif offered to him under the present circumstances. His Royal Highness\r\nalso added the expression of his sincere regret, that a proposal of this\r\nnature should have been submitted to his consideration by one, of whose\r\nattachment and fidelity to himself he was well convinced, but who ought\r\nto have felt, from the line of conduct adopted and persevered in by his\r\nRoyal Highness, that he was the very last person that should have been\r\napplied to for either his opinion or countenance respecting the political\r\nconduct or connection of any public character,--especially of one so\r\nintimately connected with him, and belonging to his family.\r\n\r\nIf, at any time, Sheridan had entertained the idea of associating\r\nhimself, by office, with the Ministry of Mr. Addington, (and proposals to\r\nthis effect were, it is certain, made to him,) his knowledge of the\r\nexistence of such feelings as prompted this answer to Mr. Erskine would,\r\nof course, have been sufficient to divert him from the intention.\r\n\r\nThe following document, which I have found, in his own handwriting, and\r\nwhich was intended, apparently, for publication in the newspapers,\r\ncontains some particulars with respect to the proceedings of his party at\r\nthis time, which, coming from such a source, may be considered as\r\nauthentic:--\r\n\r\n\"STATE OF PARTIES.\r\n\r\n\"Among the various rumors of Coalitions, or attempted Coalitions, we have\r\nalready expressed our disbelief in that reported to have taken place\r\nbetween the Grenville-Windhamites and Mr. Fox. At least, if it was ever\r\nin negotiation, we have reason to think it received an early check,\r\narising from a strong party of the _Old Opposition_ protesting\r\nagainst it. The account of this transaction, as whispered in the\r\npolitical circles, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"In consequence of some of the most respectable members of the Old\r\nOpposition being sounded on the subject, a meeting was held at\r\nNorfolk-House; when it was determined, with very few dissentient voices,\r\nto present a friendly remonstrance on the subject to Mr. Fox, stating the\r\nmanifold reasons which obviously presented themselves against such a\r\nprocedure, both as affecting Character and Party. it was urged that the\r\npresent Ministers had, on the score of innovation on the Constitution,\r\ngiven the Whigs no pretence for complaint whatever; and, as to their\r\nalleged incapacity, it remained to be proved that they were capable of\r\ncommitting errors and producing miscarriages, equal to those which had\r\nmarked the councils of their predecessors, whom the measure in question\r\nwas expressly calculated to replace in power. At such a momentous crisis,\r\ntherefore, waving all considerations of past political provocation, to\r\nattempt, by the strength and combination of party, to expel the Ministers\r\nof His Majesty's choice, and to force into his closet those whom the\r\nWhigs ought to be the first to rejoice that he had excluded from it, was\r\nstated to be a proceeding which would assuredly revolt the public\r\nfeeling, degrade the character of Parliament, and produce possibly\r\nincalculable mischief to the country.\r\n\r\n\"We understand that Mr. Fox's reply was, that he would never take any\r\npolitical step against the wishes and advice of the majority of his old\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\"The paper is said to have been drawn up by Mr. Erskine, and to have been\r\npresented to Mr. Fox by his Grace of Norfolk, on the day His Majesty was\r\npronounced to be recovered from his first illness. Rumor places among the\r\nsupporters of this measure the written authority of the Duke of\r\nNorthumberland and the Earl of Moira, with the signatures of Messrs.\r\nErskine, Sheridan, Shum, Curwen, Western, Brogden, and a long _et\r\ncaetera_. It is said also that the Prince's sanction had been\r\npreviously given to the Duke,--His Royal Highness deprecating all party\r\nstruggle, at a moment when the defence of all that is dear to Britons\r\nought to be the single sentiment that should fill the public mind.\r\n\r\n\"We do not vouch for the above being strictly accurate; but we are\r\nconfident that it is not far from the truth.\"\r\n\r\nThe illness of the King, referred to in this paper, had been first\r\npublicly announced in the month of February, and was for some time\r\nconsidered of so serious a nature, that arrangements were actually in\r\nprogress for the establishment of a Regency. Mr. Sheridan, who now formed\r\na sort of connecting link between Carlton-House and the Minister, took,\r\nof course, a leading part in the negotiations preparatory to such a\r\nmeasure. It appears, from a letter of Mr. Fox on the subject, that the\r\nPrince and another person, whom it is unnecessary to name, were at one\r\nmoment not a little alarmed by a rumor of an intention to associate the\r\nDuke of York and the Queen in the Regency. Mr. Fox, however, begs of\r\nSheridan to tranquillize their minds on this point:--the intentions, (he\r\nadds,) of \"the Doctor,\" [Footnote: To the infliction of this nickname on\r\nhis friend, Mr. Addington, Sheridan was, in no small degree, accessory,\r\nby applying to those who disapproved of his administration, and yet gave\r\nno reasons for their disapprobation, the well-known lines,--\r\n\r\n  \"I do not love thee, Doctor Fell,\r\n  And why I cannot tell;\r\n  But this I know full well,\r\n  I do not love thee, Doctor Fell.\"] though bad enough in all reason, do\r\nnot go to such lengths; and a proposal of this nature, from any other\r\nquarter, could be easily defeated.\r\n\r\nWithin about two months from the date of the Remonstrance, which,\r\naccording to a statement already given, was presented to Mr. Fox by his\r\nbrother Whigs, one of the consequences which it prognosticated from the\r\nconnection of their party with the Grenvilles took place, in the\r\nresignation of Mr. Addington and the return of Mr. Pitt to power.\r\n\r\nThe confidence of Mr. Pitt, in thus taking upon himself, almost\r\nsingle-handed, the government of the country at such an awful crisis,\r\nwas, he soon perceived, not shared by the public. A general expectation\r\nhad prevailed that the three great Parties, which had lately been\r\nencamped together on the field of opposition, would have each sent its\r\nChiefs into the public councils, and thus formed such a Congress of power\r\nand talent as the difficulties of the empire, in that trying moment,\r\ndemanded. This hope had been frustrated by the repugnance of the King to\r\nMr. Fox, and the too ready facility with which Mr. Pitt had given way to\r\nit. Not only, indeed, in his undignified eagerness for office, did he\r\nsacrifice without stipulation the important question, which, but two\r\nyears before, had been made the _sine-qua non_ of his services, but,\r\nin yielding so readily to the Royal prejudices against his rival, he gave\r\na sanction to that unconstitutional principle of exclusion, [Footnote:\r\n\"This principle of personal exclusion, (said Lord Grenville,) is one of\r\nwhich I never can approve, because, independently of its operation to\r\nprevent Parliament and the people from enjoying the Administration they\r\ndesired, and which it was their particular interest to have, it tends to\r\nestablish a dangerous precedent, that would afford too much opportunity\r\nof private pique against the public interest. I, for one, therefore,\r\nrefused to connect myself with any one argument that should sanction that\r\nprinciple; and, in my opinion, every man who accepted office under that\r\nAdministration is, according to the letter and spirit of the\r\nconstitution, responsible for its character and construction, and the\r\nprinciple upon which it is founded.\"--_Speech of Lord Grenville on the\r\nmotion of Lord Darnley for the repeal of the Additional Force Bill, Feb.\r\n15, 1805._] which, if thus acted upon by the party-feelings of the\r\nMonarch, would soon narrow the Throne into the mere nucleus of a favored\r\nfaction. In allowing, too, his friends and partisans to throw the whole\r\nblame of this exclusive Ministry on the King, he but repeated the\r\nindecorum of which he had been guilty in 1802. For, having at that time\r\nmade use of the religious prejudices of the Monarch, as a pretext for his\r\nmanner of quitting office, he now employed the political prejudices of\r\nthe same personage, as an equally convenient excuse for his manner of\r\nreturning to it.\r\n\r\nA few extracts from the speech of Mr. Sheridan upon the Additional Force\r\nBill,--the only occasion on which he seems to have spoken during the\r\npresent year,--will show that the rarity of his displays was not owing to\r\nany failure of power, but rather, perhaps, to the increasing involvement\r\nof his circumstances, which left no time for the thought and preparation\r\nthat all his public efforts required.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt had, at the commencement of this year, condescended to call to\r\nhis aid the co-operation of Mr. Addington, Lord Buckinghamshire, and\r\nother members of that Administration, which had withered away, but a few\r\nmonths before, under the blight of his sarcasm and scorn. In alluding to\r\nthis Coalition, Sheridan says--\r\n\r\n\"The Right Honorable Gentleman went into office alone;--but, lest the\r\ngovernment should become too full of vigor from his support, he thought\r\nproper to beckon back some of the weakness of the former administration.\r\nHe, I suppose, thought that the Ministry became, from his support, like\r\nspirits above proof, and required to be diluted; that, like gold refined\r\nto a certain degree, it would be unfit for use without a certain mixture\r\nof alloy; that the administration would be too brilliant, and dazzle the\r\nHouse, unless he called back a certain part of the mist and fog of the\r\nlast administration to render it tolerable to the eye. As to the great\r\nchange made in the Ministry by the introduction of the Right Honorable\r\nGentleman himself, I would ask, does he imagine that he came back to\r\noffice with the same estimation that he left it? I am sure he is much\r\nmistaken if he fancies that he did. The Right Honorable Gentleman retired\r\nfrom office because, as was stated, he could not carry an important\r\nquestion, which he deemed necessary to satisfy the just claims of the\r\nCatholics; and in going out he did not hesitate to tear off the sacred\r\nveil of Majesty, describing his Sovereign as the only person that stood\r\nin the way of this desirable object. After the Right Honorable\r\nGentleman's retirement, he advised the Catholics to look to no one but\r\nhim for the attainment of their rights, and cautiously to abstain from\r\nforming a connection with any other person. But how does it appear, now\r\nthat the Right Honorable Gentleman is returned to office? He declines to\r\nperform his promise; and has received, as his colleagues in office, those\r\nwho are pledged to resist the measure. Does not the Right Honorable\r\nGentleman then feel that he comes back to office with a character\r\ndegraded by the violation of a solemn pledge, given to a great and\r\nrespectable body of the people, upon a particular and momentous occasion?\r\nDoes the Right Honorable Gentleman imagine either that he returns to\r\noffice with the same character for political wisdom, after the\r\ndescription which he gave of the talents and capacity of his\r\npredecessors, and after having shown, by his own actions, that his\r\ndescription was totally unfounded?\"\r\n\r\nIn alluding to Lord Melville's appointment to the Admiralty; he says,--\r\n\r\n\"But then, I am told, there is the First Lord of the Admiralty,--'Do you\r\nforget the leader of the grand Catamaran project? Are you not aware of\r\nthe important change in that department, and the advantage the country is\r\nlikely to derive from that change?' Why, I answer, that I do not know of\r\nany peculiar qualifications the Noble Lord has to preside over the\r\nAdmiralty; but I do know, that if I were to judge of him from the kind of\r\ncapacity he evinced while Minister of War, I should entertain little\r\nhopes of him. If, however, the Right Honorable Gentleman should say to\r\nme, 'Where else would you put that Noble Lord, would you have him\r\nappointed War-Minister again?' I should say, Oh no, by no means,--I\r\nremember too well the expeditions to Toulon, to Quiberon, to Corsica, and\r\nto Holland, the responsibility for each of which the Noble Lord took on\r\nhimself, entirely releasing from any responsibility the Commander in\r\nChief and the Secretary at War. I also remember that, which, although so\r\nglorious to our arms in the result, I still shall call a most\r\nunwarrantable project.--the expedition to Egypt. It may be said, that as\r\nthe Noble Lord was so unfit for the military department, the naval was\r\nthe proper place for him. Perhaps there wore people who would adopt this\r\nwhimsical reasoning. I remember a story told respecting Mr. Garrick, who\r\nwas once applied to by an eccentric Scotchman, to introduce a production\r\nof his on the stage. This Scotchman was such a good-humored fellow, that\r\nhe was called 'Honest Johnny M'Cree.' Johnny wrote four acts of a\r\ntragedy, which he showed to Mr. Garrick, who dissuaded him from finishing\r\nit; telling him that his talent did not lie that way; so Johnny abandoned\r\nthe tragedy, and set about writing a comedy. When this was finished, he\r\nshowed it to Mr. Garrick, who found it to be still more exceptionable\r\nthan the tragedy, and of course could not be persuaded to bring it\r\nforward on the stage. This surprised poor Johnny, and he remonstrated.\r\n'Nay, now, David, (said Johnny,) did you not tell me my talents did not\r\nlie in tragedy?'--'Yes, (replied Garrick,) but I did not tell you that\r\nthey lay in comedy.'--'Then, (exclaimed Johnny,) gin they dinna lie\r\nthere, where the de'il dittha lie, mon?' Unless the Noble Lord at the\r\nhead of the Admiralty has the same reasoning in his mind as Johnny\r\nM'Cree, he cannot possibly suppose that his incapacity for the direction\r\nof the War-department necessarily qualifies him for the Presidency of the\r\nNaval. Perhaps, if the Noble Lord be told that he has no talents for the\r\nlatter, His Lordship may exclaim with honest Johnny M'Cree, 'Gin they\r\ndinna lie there, where the de'il dittha lie, mon?'\"\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of May, the claims of the Roman Catholics of Ireland, were,\r\nfor the first time, brought under the notice of the Imperial Parliament,\r\nby Lord Grenville in the House of Lords, and by Mr. Fox in the House of\r\nCommons. A few days before the debate, as appears, by the following\r\nremarkable letter, Mr. Sheridan was made the medium of a communication\r\nfrom Carlton House, the object of which was to prevent Mr. Fox from\r\npresenting the Petition.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SHERIDAN,\r\n\r\n\"I did not receive your letter till last night.\r\n\r\n\"I did, on Thursday, consent to be the presenter of the Catholic\r\nPetition, at the request of the Delegates, and had further conversation\r\non the subject with them at Lord Grenville's yesterday morning. Lord\r\nGrenville also consented to present the Petition to the House of Lords.\r\nNow, therefore, any discussion on this part of the subject would be too\r\nlate; but I will fairly own, that, if it were not, I could not be\r\ndissuaded from doing the public act, which, of all others, it will give\r\nme the greatest satisfaction and pride to perform. No past event in my\r\npolitical life ever did, and no future one ever can, give me such\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure you know how painful it would be to me to disobey any command\r\nof His Royal Highness's, or even to act in any manner that might be in\r\nthe slightest degree contrary to his wishes, and therefore I am not sorry\r\nthat your intimation came too late. I shall endeavor to see the Prince\r\ntoday; but, if I should fail, pray take care that he knows how things\r\nstand before we meet at dinner, lest any conversation there should appear\r\nto come upon him by surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yours ever,\r\n\r\n_\"Arlington Street, Sunday,_\r\n\r\n\"C. J. F.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be rash, without some further insight into the circumstances of\r\nthis singular interference, to enter into any speculations with respect\r\nto its nature or motives, or to pronounce how far Mr. Sheridan was\r\njustified in being the instrument of it. But on the share of Mr. Fox in\r\nthe transaction, such suspension of opinion is unnecessary. We have here\r\nhis simple and honest words before us,--and they breathe a spirit of\r\nsincerity from which even Princes might take a lesson with advantage.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt was not long in discovering that place does not always imply\r\nPower, and that in separating himself from the other able men of the day,\r\nhe had but created an Opposition as much too strong for the Government,\r\nas the Government itself was too weak for the country. The humiliating\r\nresource to which he was driven, in trying, as a tonic, the reluctant\r\nalliance of Lord Sidmouth,--the abortiveness of his efforts to avert the\r\nfull of his old friend, Lord Melville, and the fatality of ill luck that\r\nstill attended his exertions against France,--all concurred to render this\r\nreign of the once powerful Minister a series of humiliations, shifts, and\r\ndisasters, unlike his former proud period in every thing but ill success.\r\nThe powerful Coalition opposed to him already had a prospect of carrying\r\nby storm the post which he occupied, when, by his death, it was\r\nsurrendered, without parley, into their hands.\r\n\r\nThe Administration that succeeded, under the auspices of Lord Greville\r\nand Mr. Fox, bore a resemblance to the celebrated Brass of Corinth, more,\r\nperhaps, in the variety of the metals brought together, than in the\r\nperfection of the compound that resulted from their fusion. [Footnote:\r\nSee in the Annual Register of 1806, some able remarks upon Coalitions in\r\ngeneral, as well as a temperate defence of this Coalition in\r\nparticular,--for which that work is, I suspect, indebted to a hand such as\r\nhas not often, since the time of Burke, enriched its pages.] There were\r\ncomprised in it, indeed, not only the two great parties of the leading\r\nchiefs, but those Whigs who differed with them both under the Addington\r\nMinistry, and the Addingtons that differed with them all on the subject\r\nof the Catholic claims. With this last anomalous addition to the\r\nmiscellany the influence of Sheridan is mainly chargeable. Having, for\r\nsome time past, exerted all his powers of management to bring about a\r\ncoalition between Carlton-House and Lord Sidmouth, he had been at length\r\nso successful, that upon the formation of the present Ministry, it was\r\nthe express desire of the Prince that Lord Sidmouth should constitute a\r\npart of it. To the same unlucky influence, too, is to be traced the very\r\nquestionable measure, (notwithstanding the great learning and ability\r\nwith which it was defended,) of introducing the Chief Justice, Lord\r\nEllenborough, into the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nAs to Sheridan's own share in the arrangements, it was, no doubt,\r\nexpected by him that he should now be included among the members of the\r\nCabinet; and it is probable that Mr. Fox, at the head of a purely Whig\r\nministry, would have so far considered the services of his ancient ally,\r\nand the popularity still attached to his name through the country, as to\r\nconfer upon him this mark of distinction and confidence. But there were\r\nother interests to be consulted;--and the undisguised earnestness with\r\nwhich Sheridan had opposed the union of his party with the Grenvilles,\r\nleft him but little supererogation of services to expect in that quarter.\r\nSome of his nearest friends, and particularly Mrs. Sheridan, entreated,\r\nas I understand, in the most anxious manner, that he would not accept any\r\nsuch office as that of Treasurer of the Navy, for the responsibility and\r\nbusiness of which they knew his habits so wholly unfitted him,--but that,\r\nif excluded by his colleagues from the distinction of a seat in the\r\nCabinet, he should decline all office whatsoever, and take his chance in\r\na friendly independence of them. But the time was now past when he could\r\nafford to adopt this policy,--the emoluments of a place were too\r\nnecessary to him to be rejected;--and, in accepting the same office that\r\nhad been allotted to him in the Regency--arrangements of 1789, he must\r\nhave felt, with no small degree of mortification, how stationary all his\r\nefforts since then had left him, and what a blank was thus made of all\r\nhis services in the interval.\r\n\r\nThe period of this Ministry, connected with the name of Mr. Fox, though\r\nbrief, and in some respects, far from laudable, was distinguished by two\r\nmeasures,--the Plan of Limited Service, and the Resolution for the\r\nAbolition of the Slave-Trade,--which will long be remembered to the honor\r\nof those concerned in them. The motion of Mr. Fox against the Slave-Trade\r\nwas the last he ever made in Parliament;--and the same sort of melancholy\r\nadmiration that Pliny expressed, in speaking of a beautiful picture, the\r\npainter of which had died in finishing it,--\"dolor manas dum id ageret,\r\nabreptae\"--comes naturally over our hearts in thinking of the last,\r\nglorious work, to which this illustrious statesman, in dying, set his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThough it is not true, as has been asserted, that Mr. Fox refused to see\r\nSheridan in his last illness, it is but too certain that those\r\nappearances of alienation or reserve, which had been for some time past\r\nobservable in the former, continued to throw a restraint over their\r\nintercourse with each other to the last. It is a proof, however, of the\r\nabsence of any serious grounds for this distrust, that Sheridan as the\r\nperson selected by the relatives of Mr. Fox to preside over and direct\r\nthe arrangements of the funeral, and that he put the last, solemn seal to\r\ntheir long intimacy, by following his friend, as mourner, to the grave.\r\n\r\nThe honor of representing the city of Westminster in Parliament had been,\r\nfor some time, one of the dreams of Sheridan's ambition. It was\r\nsuspected, indeed,--I know not with what justice,--that in advising Mr.\r\nFox, as he is said to have done, about the year 1800, to secede from\r\npublic life altogether, he was actuated by a wish to succeed him in the\r\nrepresentation of Westminster, and had even already set on foot some\r\nprivate negotiations towards that object. Whatever grounds there may have\r\nbeen for this suspicion, the strong wish that he felt on the subject had\r\nlong been sufficiently known to his colleagues; and on the death of Mr.\r\nFox, it appeared, not only to himself, but the public, that he was the\r\nperson naturally pointed out as most fit to be his parliamentary\r\nsuccessor. It was, therefore, with no slight degree of disappointment he\r\ndiscovered, that the ascendancy of Aristocratic influence was, as usual,\r\nto prevail, and that the young son of the Duke of Northumberland would be\r\nsupported by the Government in preference to him, It is but right,\r\nhowever, in justice to the Ministry, to state, that the neglect with\r\nwhich they appear to have treated him on this occasion,--particularly in\r\nnot apprising him of their decision in favor of Lord Percy, sufficiently\r\nearly to save him from the humiliation of a fruitless attempt,--is\r\nproved, by the following letters, to have originated in a double\r\nmisapprehension, by which, while Sheridan, on one side, was led to\r\nbelieve that the Ministers would favor his pretensions, the Ministers, on\r\nthe other, were induced to think that he had given up all intentions of\r\nbeing a candidate.\r\n\r\nThe first letter is addressed to the gentleman, (one of Sheridan's\r\nintimate friends,) who seems to have been, unintentionally, the cause of\r\nthe mistake on both sides.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR ----,\r\n\r\n\"_Somerset-Place, September 14._\r\n\r\n\"You must have seen by my manner, yesterday, how much I was surprised and\r\nhurt at learning, for the first time, that Lord Grenville had, many days\r\nprevious to Mr. Fox's death, decided to support Lord Percy on the\r\nexpected vacancy for Westminster, and that you had since been the active\r\nagent in the canvass actually commenced. I do not like to think I have\r\ngrounds to complain or change my opinion of any friend, without being\r\nvery explicit, and opening my mind, without reserve, on such a subject. I\r\nmust frankly declare, that I think you have brought yourself and me into\r\na very unpleasant dilemma. You seemed to say, last night, that you had\r\nnot been apprised of my intention to offer for Westminster on the\r\napprehended vacancy. I am confident you have acted under that impression;\r\nbut I must impute to you either great inattention to what fell from me in\r\nour last conversation on the subject, or great inaccuracy of\r\nrecollection; for I solemnly protest I considered you as the individual\r\nmost distinctly apprised, that at this moment to succeed that great man\r\nand revered friend in Westminster, should the fatal event take place,\r\nwould be the highest object of my ambition; for, in that conversation I\r\nthanked you expressly for informing me that Lord Grenville had said to\r\nyourself, upon Lord Percy being suggested to him, that he, Lord\r\nGrenville, '_would decide on nothing until Mr. Sheridan had been spoken\r\nto, and his intentions known_' or words precisely to that effect. I\r\nexpressed my grateful sense of Lord Grenville's attention, and said, that\r\nit would confirm me in my intention of making no application, however\r\nhopeless myself respecting Mr. Fox, while life remained with him,--and\r\nthese words of Lord Grenville you allowed last night to have been so\r\nstated to me, though not as a message from His Lordship. Since that time\r\nI think we have not happened to meet; at least sure I am, we have had no\r\nconversation on the subject. Having the highest opinion of Lord\r\nGrenville's honor and sincerity, I must be confident that he must have\r\nhad another impression made on his mind respecting my wishes before I was\r\nentirely passed by. I do not mean to say that my offering myself was\r\nimmediately to entitle me to the support of Government, but I do mean to\r\nsay, that my pretensions were entitled to consideration before that\r\nsupport was offered to another without the slightest notice taken of\r\nme,--the more especially as the words of Lord Grenville, reported by you\r\nto me, had been stated by me to many friends as my reliance and\r\njustification in not following their advice by making a direct\r\napplication to Government. I pledged myself to them that Lord Grenville\r\nwould not promise the support of Government till my intentions had been\r\nasked, and I quoted your authority for doing so: I never heard a syllable\r\nof that support being promised to Lord Percy until from you on the\r\nevening of Mr. Fox's death. Did I ever authorize you to inform Lord\r\nGrenville that I had abandoned the idea of offering myself? These are\r\npoints which it is necessary, for the honor of all parties, should be\r\namicably explained. I therefore propose, as the shortest way of effecting\r\nit,--wishing you not to consider this letter as in any degree\r\nconfidential,--that my statements in this letter may be submitted to any\r\ntwo common friends, or to the Lord Chancellor alone, and let it be\r\nascertained where the error has arisen, for error is all I complain of;\r\nand, with regard to Lord Grenville, I desire distinctly to say, that I\r\nfeel myself indebted for the fairness and kindness of his intentions\r\ntowards me. My disappointment of the protection of Government may be a\r\nsufficient excuse to the friends I am pledged to, should I retire; but I\r\nmust have it understood whether or not I deceived them, when I led them\r\nto expect that I should have that support.\r\n\r\n\"I hope to remain ever yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\r\n\r\n\"The sooner the reference I propose the better.\"\r\n\r\nThe second letter, which is still further explanatory of the\r\nmisconception, was addressed by Sheridan to Lord Grenville:\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n\"Since I had the honor of Your Lordship's letter, I have received one\r\nfrom Mr. ----, in which, I am sorry to observe he is silent as to my offer\r\nof meeting, in the presence of a third person, in order to ascertain\r\nwhether he did or not so report a conversation with Your Lordship as to\r\nimpress on my mind a belief that my pretensions would be considered,\r\nbefore the support of Government should be pledged elsewhere. Instead of\r\nthis, he not only does not admit the precise words quoted by me, but does\r\nnot state what he allows he did say. If he denies that he ever gave me\r\nreason to adopt the belief I have stated, be it so; but the only\r\nstipulation I have made is that we should come to an explicit\r\nunderstanding on this subject,--not with a view to quoting words or\r\nrepeating names, but that the misapprehension, whatever it was, may be so\r\nadmitted as not to leave me under an unmerited degree of discredit and\r\ndisgrace. Mr. ---- certainly never encouraged me to stand for Westminster,\r\nbut, on the contrary, advised me to support Lord Percy, which made me the\r\nmore mark at the time the fairness with which I thought he apprised me of\r\nthe preference my pretensions were likely to receive in Your Lordship's\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\"Unquestionably Your Lordship's recollection of what passed between\r\nMr. ---- and yourself must be just; and were it no more than what you said\r\non the same subject to Lord Howick, I consider it as a mark of attention;\r\nbut what has astonished me is, that Mr. ---- should ever have informed\r\nYour Lordship, as he admits he did, that I had no intention of offering\r\nmyself. This naturally must have put from your mind whatever degree of\r\ndisposition was there to have made a preferable application to me; and\r\nLord Howick's answer to your question, on which I have ventured to make a\r\nfriendly remonstrance, must have confirmed Mr. ----'s report. But allow me\r\nto suppose that I had myself seen Your Lordship, and that you had\r\nexplicitly promised me the support of Government, and had afterwards sent\r\nfor me and informed me that it was at all an object to you that I should\r\ngive way to Lord Percy, I assure you, with the utmost sincerity, that I\r\nshould cheerfully have withdrawn myself, and applied every interest I\r\npossessed as your Lordship should have directed.\r\n\r\n\"All I request is, that what passed between me and Mr. ---- may take an\r\nintelligible shape before any common friend, or before Your Lordship.\r\nThis I conceive to be a preliminary due to my own honor, and what he\r\nought not to evade.\"\r\n\r\nThe Address which he delivered, at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, in\r\ndeclining the offer of support which many of the electors still pressed\r\nupon him, contains some of those touches of personal feeling which a\r\nbiographer is more particularly bound to preserve. In speaking of Mr.\r\nFox, he said,--\r\n\r\n\"It is true there have been occasions upon which I have differed with him\r\n--painful recollections of the most painful moments of my political life!\r\nNor were there wanting those who endeavored to represent these\r\ndifferences as a departure from the homage which his superior mind,\r\nthough unclaimed by him, was entitled to, and from the allegiance of\r\nfriendship which our hearts all swore to him. But never was the genuine\r\nand confiding texture of his soul more manifest than on such occasions;\r\nhe knew that nothing on earth could detach me from him; and he resented\r\ninsinuations against the sincerity and integrity of a friend, which he\r\nwould not have noticed had they been pointed against himself. With such a\r\nman to have battled in the cause of genuine liberty,--with such a man to\r\nhave struggled against the inroads of oppression and corruption,--with\r\nsuch an example before me, to have to boast that I never in my life gave\r\none vote in Parliament that was not on the side of freedom, is the\r\ncongratulation that attends the retrospect of my public life. His\r\nfriendship was the pride and honor of my days. I never, for one moment,\r\nregretted to share with him the difficulties, the calumnies, and\r\nsometimes even the dangers, that attended an honorable course. And now,\r\nreviewing my past political life, were the option possible that I should\r\nretread the path. I solemnly and deliberately declare that I would prefer\r\nto pursue the same course; to bear up under the same pressure; to abide\r\nby the same principles; and remain by his side an exile from power,\r\ndistinction, and emolument, rather than be at this moment a splendid\r\nexample of successful servility or prosperous apostacy, though clothed\r\nwith power, honor, titles, gorged with sinecures, and lord of hoards\r\nobtained from the plunder of the people.\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of his Address he thus alludes, with evidently a deep\r\nfeeling of discontent, to the circumstances that had obliged him to\r\ndecline the honor now proposed to him:--\r\n\r\n\"Illiberal warnings have been held out, most unauthoritatively I know,\r\nthat by persevering in the present contest I may risk my official\r\nsituation, and if I retire, I am aware, that minds, as coarse and\r\nilliberal, may assign the dread of that as my motive. To such\r\ninsinuations I shall scorn to make any other reply than a reference to\r\nthe whole of my past political career. I consider it as no boast to say,\r\nthat any one who has struggled through such a portion of life as I have,\r\nwithout obtaining an office, is not likely to I abandon his principles to\r\nretain one when acquired. If riches do not give independence, the\r\nnext-best thing to being very rich is to have been used to be very poor.\r\nBut independence is not allied to wealth, to birth, to rank, to power, to\r\ntitles, or to honor. Independence is in the mind of a man, or it is no\r\nwhere. On this ground were I to decline the contest, should scorn the\r\nimputation that should bring the purity of my purpose into doubt. No\r\nMinister can expect to find in me a servile vassal. No Minister can\r\nexpect from me the abandonment of any principle I have avowed, or any\r\npledge I have given. I know not that I have hitherto shrunk in place from\r\nopinions I have maintained while in opposition. Did there exist a\r\nMinister of a different cast from any I know in being, were he to attempt\r\nto exact from me a different conduct, my office should be at his service\r\ntomorrow. Such a Minister might strip me of my situation, in some\r\nrespects of considerable emolument, but he could not strip me of the\r\nproud conviction that I was right; he could not strip me of my own\r\nself-esteem; he could not strip me, I think, of some portion of the\r\nconfidence and good opinion of the people. But I am noticing the\r\ncalumnious threat I allude to more than it deserves. There can be no\r\nperil, I venture to assert, under the present Government, in the free\r\nexercise of discretion, such as belongs to the present question. I\r\ntherefore disclaim the merit of putting anything to hazard. If I have\r\nmissed the opportunity of obtaining all the support I might, perhaps,\r\nhave had on the present occasion, from a very scrupulous delicacy, which\r\nI think became and was incumbent upon me, but which I by no means\r\nconceive to have been a fit rule for others, I cannot repent it. While\r\nthe slightest aspiration of breath passed those lips, now closed for\r\never,--while one drop of life's blood beat in that heart, now cold for\r\never,--I could not, I ought not, to have acted otherwise than I did.--I\r\nnow come with a very embarrassed feeling to that declaration which I yet\r\nthink you must have expected from me, but which I make with reluctance,\r\nbecause, from the marked approbation I have experienced from you, I fear\r\nthat with reluctance you will receive it.--I feel myself under the\r\nnecessity of retiring from this contest.\"\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks after, ensued the Dissolution of Parliament,--a\r\nmeasure attended with considerable unpopularity to the Ministry, and\r\noriginating as much in the enmity of one of its members to Lord Sidmouth,\r\nas the introduction of that noble Lord among them, at all, was owing to\r\nthe friendship of another. In consequence of this event, Lord Percy\r\nhaving declined offering himself again, Mr. Sheridan became a candidate\r\nfor Westminster, and after a most riotous contest with a demagogue of the\r\nmoment, named Paul, was, together with Sir Samuel Hood, declared duly\r\nelected.\r\n\r\nThe moderate measure in favor of the Roman Catholics, which the Ministry\r\nnow thought it due to the expectations of that body to bring forward,\r\nwas, as might be expected, taken advantage of by the King to rid himself\r\nof their counsels, and produced one of those bursts of bigotry, by which\r\nthe people of England have so often disgraced themselves. It is sometimes\r\na misfortune to men of wit, that they put their opinions in a form to be\r\nremembered. We might, perhaps, have been ignorant of the keen, but\r\nworldly view which Mr. Sheridan, on this occasion, took of the hardihood\r\nof his colleagues, if he had not himself expressed it in a form so\r\nportable to the memory. \"He had often,\" he said, \"heard of people\r\nknocking out their brains against a wall, but never before knew of any\r\none building a wall expressly for the purpose.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be owned, indeed, that, though far too sagacious and liberal not\r\nto be deeply impressed with the justice of the claims advanced by the\r\nCatholics, he was not altogether disposed to go those generous lengths in\r\ntheir favor, of which Mr. Fox and a few others of their less calculating\r\nfriends were capable. It was his avowed opinion, that, though the\r\nmeasure, whenever brought forward, should be supported and enforced by\r\nthe whole weight of the party, they ought never so far to identify or\r\nencumber themselves with it, as to make its adoption a sine-qua-non of\r\ntheir acceptance or retention of office. His support, too, of the\r\nMinistry of Mr. Addington, which was as virtually pledged against the\r\nCatholics as that which now succeeded to power, sufficiently shows the\r\nsecondary station that this great question occupied in his mind; nor can\r\nsuch a deviation from the usual tone of his political feelings be\r\notherwise accounted for, than by supposing that he was aware of the\r\nexistence of a strong indisposition to the measure in that quarter, by\r\nwhose views and wishes his public conduct was, in most cases, regulated.\r\n\r\nOn the general question, however, of the misgovernment of Ireland, and\r\nthe disabilities of the Catholics, as forming its most prominent feature,\r\nhis zeal was always forthcoming and ardent,--and never more so than\r\nduring the present Session, when, on the question of the Irish Arms Bill,\r\nand his own motion upon the State of Ireland, he distinguished himself by\r\nan animation and vigor worthy of the best period of his eloquence.\r\n\r\nMr. Grattan, in supporting the coercive measures now adopted against his\r\ncountry, had shown himself, for once, alarmed into a concurrence with the\r\nwretched system of governing by Insurrection Acts, and, for once, lent\r\nhis sanction to the principle upon which all such measures are founded,\r\nnamely, that of enabling Power to defend itself against the consequences\r\nof its own tyranny and injustice. In alluding to some expressions used by\r\nthis great man, Sheridan said:--\r\n\r\n\"He now happened to recollect what was said by a Right Honorable\r\nGentleman, to whose opinions they all deferred, (Mr. Grattan,) that\r\nnotwithstanding he voted for the present measure, with all its defects,\r\nrather than lose it altogether, yet that gentleman said, that he hoped to\r\nsecure the revisionary interest of the Constitution to Ireland. But when\r\nhe saw that the Constitution was suspended from the year 1796 to the\r\npresent period, and that it was now likely to be continued for three\r\nyears longer, the danger was that we might lose the interest\r\naltogether;--when we were mortgaged for such a length of time, at last a\r\nforeclosure might take place.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is an instance of that happy power of applying old stories,\r\nfor which Mr. Windham, no less than Sheridan, was remarkable, and which,\r\nby promoting anecdote into the service of argument and wit, ennobles it,\r\nwhen trivial, and gives new youth to it, when old.\r\n\r\n\"When they and others complain of the discontents of the Irish, they\r\nnever appear to consider the cause. When they express their surprise that\r\nthe Irish are not contented, while according to their observation, that\r\npeople have so much reason to be happy, they betray a total ignorance of\r\ntheir actual circumstances. The fact is, that the tyranny practised upon\r\nthe Irish has been throughout unremitting. There has been no change but\r\nin the manner of inflicting it. They have had nothing but variety in\r\noppression, extending to all ranks and degrees of a certain description\r\nof the people. If you would know what this varied oppression consisted\r\nin, I refer you to the Penal Statutes you have repealed, and to some of\r\nthose which still exist. There you will see the high and the low equally\r\nsubjected to the lash of persecution; and yet still some persons affect\r\nto be astonished at the discontents of the Irish. But with all my\r\nreluctance to introduce any thing ludicrous upon so serious an occasion,\r\nI cannot help referring to a little story which those very astonished\r\npersons call to my mind. It was with respect to an Irish drummer, who was\r\nemployed to inflict punishment upon a soldier. When the boy struck high,\r\nthe poor soldier exclaimed, 'Lower, bless you,' with which the boy\r\ncomplied. But soon after the soldier exclaimed, 'Higher if you please,'\r\nBut again he called out, 'A little lower:' upon which the accommodating\r\nboy addressed him--'Now, upon my conscience, I see you are a discontented\r\nman; for, strike where I may, there's no pleasing you.' Now your\r\ncomplaint of the discontents of the Irish appears to me quite as\r\nrational, while you continue to strike, only altering the place of\r\nattack.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this speech, which may be considered as the _bouquet_, or last\r\nparting blaze of his eloquence, he appears to have bestowed considerable\r\ncare and thought. The concluding sentences of the following passage,\r\nthough in his very worst taste, were as anxiously labored by him, and put\r\nthrough as many rehearsals on paper, as any of the most highly finished\r\nwitticisms in The School for Scandal.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot think patiently of such petty squabbles, while Bonaparte is\r\ngrasping the nations; while he is surrounding France, not with that iron\r\nfrontier, for which the wish and childish ambition of Louis XIV. was so\r\neager, but with kingdoms of his own creation; securing the gratitude of\r\nhigher minds as the hostage, and the fears of others as pledges for his\r\nsafety. His are no ordinary fortifications. His martello towers are\r\nthrones; sceptres tipt with crowns are the palisadoes of his\r\nentrenchments, and Kings are his sentinels.\"\r\n\r\nThe Reporter here, by \"tipping\" the sceptres \"with crowns,\" has improved,\r\nrather unnecessarily, upon the finery of the original. The following are\r\nspecimens of the various trials of this passage which I find scribbled\r\nover detached scraps of paper:--\r\n\r\n\"Contrast the different attitudes and occupations of the two\r\ngovernments:--B. eighteen months from his capital,--head-quarters in the\r\nvillages,--neither Berlin nor Warsaw,--dethroning and creating thrones,--\r\nthe works he raises are monarchies,--sceptres his palisadoes, thrones his\r\nmartello towers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Commissioning kings,--erecting thrones,--martello towers,--Cambaceres\r\ncount noses,--Austrians, fine dressed, like Pompey's troops.\"\r\n\r\n\"B. fences with sceptres,--his martello towers are thrones,--he alone is,\r\nFrance.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Dissolution of Parliament having taken place this year, he again\r\nbecame a candidate for the city of Westminster. But, after a violent\r\ncontest, during which he stood the coarse abuse of the mob with the\r\nutmost good humor and playfulness, the election ended in favor of Sir\r\nFrancis Burdett and Lord Cochrane, and Sheridan was returned, with his\r\nfriend Mr. Michael Angelo Taylor, for the borough of Ilchester.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1807 he had conceived some idea of leasing the property\r\nof Drury-Lane Theatre, and with that view had set on foot, through Mr.\r\nMichael Kelly, who was then in Ireland, a negotiation with Mr. Frederick\r\nJones, the proprietor of the Dublin Theatre. In explaining his object to\r\nMr. Kelly, in a letter dated August 30, 1807, he describes it as \"a plan\r\nby which the property may be leased to those who have the skill and the\r\nindustry to manage it as it should be for their own advantage, upon terms\r\nwhich would render any risk to them almost impossible;--the profit to\r\nthem, (he adds,) would probably be beyond what I could now venture to\r\nstate, and yet upon terms which would be much better for the real\r\nproprietors than any thing that can arise from the careless and ignorant\r\nmanner in which the undertaking is now misconducted by those who, my son\r\nexcepted, have no interest in its success, and who lose nothing by its\r\nfailure.\"\r\n\r\nThe negotiation with Mr. Jones was continued into the following year;\r\nand, according to a draft of agreement, which this gentleman has been\r\nkind enough to show me, in Sheridan's handwriting, it was intended that\r\nMr. Jones should, on becoming proprietor of one quarter-share of the\r\nproperty, \"undertake the management of the Theatre in conjunction with\r\nMr. T. Sheridan, and be entitled to the same remuneration, namely, 1000£.\r\nper annum certain income, and a certain per centage on the net profits\r\narising from the office-receipts, as should be agreed upon,\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe following memorandum of a bet connected with this transaction, is of\r\nsomewhat a higher class of wagers than the One Tun Tavern has often had\r\nthe honor of recording among its archives:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_One Tun, St. James's Market, May 26, 1808._\"\r\n\r\n\"In the presence of Messrs.

Had his political associates but\r\nlearned from his example thus to place themselves in advance of the\r\nprocession of events, they would not have had the triumphal wheels pass\r\nby them and over them so frequently. Immediately on the arrival of the\r\nDeputies from Spain, he called the attention of the House to the affairs\r\nof that country; and his speech on the subject, though short and\r\nunstudied, had not only the merit of falling in with the popular feeling\r\nat the moment, but, from the views which it pointed out through the\r\nbright opening now made by Spain, was every way calculated to be useful\r\nboth at home and abroad.\r\n\r\n\"Let Spain,\" he said, \"see, that we were not inclined to stint the\r\nservices we had it in our power to render her; that we were not actuated\r\nby the desire of any petty advantage to ourselves; but that our exertions\r\nwere to be solely directed to the attainment of the grand and general\r\nobject, the emancipation of the world. If the flame were once fairly\r\ncaught, our success was certain. France would then find, that she had\r\nhitherto been contending only against principalities, powers, and\r\nauthorities, but that she had now to contend against a people.\"\r\n\r\nThe death of Lord Lake this year removed those difficulties which had,\r\never since the appointment of Sheridan to the receivership of the Duchy\r\nof Cornwall, stood in the way of his reaping the full advantages of that\r\noffice. Previously to the departure of General Lake for India, the Prince\r\nhad granted to him the reversion of this situation which was then filled\r\nby Lord Elliot. It was afterwards, however, discovered that, according to\r\nthe terms of the Grant, the place could not be legally held or deputed by\r\nany one who had not been actually sworn into it before the Prince's\r\nCouncil. On the death of Lord Elliot, therefore, His Royal Highness\r\nthought himself authorized, as we have seen, in conferring the\r\nappointment upon Mr. Sheridan. This step, however, was considered by the\r\nfriends of General Lake as not only a breach of promise, but a violation\r\nof right; and it would seem from one of the documents which I am about to\r\ngive, that measures were even in train for enforcing the claim by law.\r\nThe first is a Letter on the subject from Sheridan to Colonel M'Mahon:--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR M'MAHON,\r\n\r\n\"_Thursday evening_.\r\n\r\n\"I have thoroughly considered and reconsidered the subject we talked upon\r\ntoday. Nothing on earth shall make me risk the possibility of the\r\nPrince's goodness to me furnishing an opportunity for a single scurrilous\r\nfool's presuming to hint even that he had, in the slightest manner,\r\ndeparted from the slightest engagement. The Prince's right, in point of\r\nlaw and justice, on the present occasion to recall the appointment given,\r\nI hold to be incontestible; but, believe me, I am right in the\r\nproposition I took the liberty of submitting to His Royal Highness, and\r\nwhich (so far is he from wishing to hurt General Lake,) he graciously\r\napproved. But understand me,--my meaning is to give I up the emoluments\r\nof the situation to General Lake, holding the situation at the Prince's\r\npleasure, and abiding by an arbitrated estimate of General Lake's claim,\r\nsupposing His Royal Highness had appointed him; in other words, to value\r\nhis interest in the appointment as if he had it, and to pay him for it or\r\nresign to him.\r\n\r\n\"With the Prince's permission I should be glad to meet Mr. Warwick Lake,\r\nand I am confident that no two men of common sense and good intentions\r\ncan fail, in ten minutes, to arrange it so as to meet the Prince's\r\nwishes, and not to leave the shadow of a pretence for envious malignity\r\nto whisper a word against his decision.\r\n\r\n\"Yours ever,\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\r\n\r\n\"I write in great haste--going to A----.\"\r\n\r\nThe other Paper that I shall give, as throwing light on the transaction,\r\nis a rough and unfinished sketch by Sheridan of a statement, intended to\r\nbe transmitted to General Lake, containing the particulars of both\r\nGrants, and the documents connected with them:--\r\n\r\n\"DEAR GENERAL,\r\n\r\n\"I am commanded by the Prince of Wales to transmit to you a correct\r\nStatement of a transaction in which your name is so much implicated, and\r\nin which his feelings have been greatly wounded from a quarter, I am\r\ncommanded to say, whence he did not expect such conduct.\r\n\r\n\"As I am directed to communicate the particulars in the most authentic\r\nform, you will, I am sure, excuse on this occasion my not adopting the\r\nmode of a familiar letter.\r\n\r\n\"Authentic Statement respecting the Appointment by His Royal Highness the\r\nPrince of Wales to the Receivership of the Duchy of Cornwall, in the Year\r\n1804, to be transmitted by His Royal Highness's Command, to\r\nLieutenant-General Lake, Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in India.\r\n\r\n\"The circumstances attending the original reversionary Grant to General\r\nLake are stated in the brief for Counsel on this occasion by Mr. Bignell,\r\nthe Prince's solicitor, to be as follow: (No. I.) It was afterwards\r\nunderstood by the Prince that the service he had wished to render General\r\nLake, by this Grant, had been defeated by the terms of it; and so clearly\r\nhad it been shown that there were essential duties attached to the\r\noffice, which no Deputy was competent to execute, and that a Deputy, even\r\nfor the collection of the rents, could not be appointed but by a\r\nprincipal actually in possession of the office, (by having been sworn\r\ninto it before his Council,) that upon General appointment to the command\r\nin India, the Prince could have no conception that General Lake, could\r\nhave left the country under an impression or expectation that the Prince\r\nwould appoint him, in case of a vacancy, to the place in question.\r\nAccordingly, His Royal Highness, on the very day he heard of the death of\r\nLord Elliot, unsolicited, and of his own gracious suggestion, appointed\r\nMr. Sheridan. Mr. Sheridan returned, the next day, in a letter to the\r\nPrince, such an answer and acknowledgment as might be expected from him;\r\nand, accordingly, directions were given to make out his patent. On the\r\nensuing ---- His Royal Highness was greatly surprised at receiving the\r\nfollowing letter from Mr. Warwick Lake. (No. II.)\r\n\r\n\"His Royal Highness immediately directed Mr. Sheridan to see Mr. W. Lake,\r\nand to state his situation, and how the office was circumstanced; and for\r\nfurther distinctness to make a minute in writing * * * *.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the circumstances that had, at first, embarrassed his enjoyment\r\nof this office; but, on the death of Lord Lake, all difficulties were\r\nremoved, and the appointment was confirmed to Sheridan for his life.\r\n\r\nIn order to afford some insight into the nature of that friendship, which\r\nexisted so long between the Heir Apparent and Sheridan,--though unable,\r\nof course, to produce any of the numerous letters, on the Royal side of\r\nthe correspondence, that have been found among the papers in my\r\npossession,--I shall here give, from a rough copy in Sheridan's\r\nhand-writing, a letter which he addressed about this time to the Prince:--\r\n\r\n\"It is matter of surprise to myself, as well as of deep regret, that I\r\nshould have incurred the appearance of ungrateful neglect and disrespect\r\ntowards the person to whom I am most obliged on earth, to whom I feel the\r\nmost ardent, dutiful, and affectionate attachment, and in whose service I\r\nwould readily sacrifice my life. Yet so it is, and to nothing but a\r\nperverse combination of circumstances, which would form no excuse were I\r\nto recapitulate them, can I attribute a conduct so strange on my part;\r\nand from nothing but Your Royal Highness's kindness and benignity alone\r\ncan I expect an indulgent allowance and oblivion of that conduct: nor\r\ncould I even hope for this were I not conscious of the unabated and\r\nunalterable devotion towards Your Royal Highness which lives in my heart,\r\nand will ever continue to be its pride and boast.\r\n\r\n\"But I should ill deserve the indulgence I request did I not frankly\r\nstate what has passed in my mind, which, though it cannot justify, may,\r\nin some degree, extenuate what must have appeared so strange to Your\r\nRoyal Highness, previous to Your Royal Highness's having actually\r\nrestored me to the office I had resigned.\r\n\r\n\"I was mortified and hurt in the keenest manner by having repeated to me\r\nfrom an authority which _I then trusted,_ some expressions of Your\r\nRoyal Highness respecting me, which it was impossible I could have\r\ndeserved. Though I was most solemnly pledged never to reveal the source\r\nfrom which the communication came, I for some time intended to unburthen\r\nmy mind to my sincere friend and Your Royal Highness's most attached and\r\nexcellent servant, M'Mahon--but I suddenly discovered, beyond a doubt,\r\nthat I had been grossly deceived, and that there had not existed the\r\nslightest foundation for the tale that had been imposed on me; and I do\r\nhumbly ask Your Royal Highness's pardon for having for a moment credited\r\na fiction suggested by mischief and I malice. Yet, extraordinary as it\r\nmust seem, I had so long, under this false impression, neglected the\r\ncourse which duty and gratitude required from me, that I felt an\r\nunaccountable shyness and reserve in repairing my error, and to this\r\nprocrastination other unlucky circumstances contributed. One day when I\r\nhad the honor of meeting Your Royal Highness on horseback in\r\nOxford-Street, though your manner was as usual gracious and kind to me,\r\nyou said that I had deserted you privately and _politically_. I had\r\nlong before that been assured, though falsely I am convinced, that Your\r\nRoyal Highness had promised to make a point that I should neither speak\r\nnor vote on Lord Wellesly's business. My view of this topic, and my\r\nknowledge of the delicate situation in which Your Royal Highness stood in\r\nrespect to the Catholic question, though weak and inadequate motives, I\r\nconfess, yet encouraged the continuance of that reserve which my original\r\nerror had commenced. These subjects being passed by,--and sure I am Your\r\nRoyal Highness would never deliberately ask me to adopt a course of\r\ndebasing inconsistency,--it was my hope fully and frankly to have\r\nexplained myself and repaired my fault, when I was informed that a\r\ncircumstance that happened at Burlington-House, and which must have been\r\nheinously misrepresented, had greatly offended you; and soon after it was\r\nstated to me, by an authority which I have no objection to disclose, that\r\nYour Royal Highness had quoted, with marked disapprobation, words\r\nsupposed to have been spoken by me on the Spanish question, and of which\r\nwords, as there is a God in heaven, I never uttered one syllable.\r\n\r\n\"Most justly may Your Royal Highness answer to all this, why have I not\r\nsooner stated these circumstances, and confided in that uniform\r\nfriendship and protection which I have so long experienced at your hands.\r\nI can only plead a nervous, procrastinating nature, abetted, perhaps, by\r\nsensations of, I trust, no false pride, which, however I may blame\r\nmyself, impel me involuntarily to fly from the risk of even a cold look\r\nfrom the quarter to which I owe so much, and by whom to be esteemed is\r\nthe glory and consolation of my private and public life.\r\n\r\n\"One point only remains for me to intrude upon Your Royal Highness's\r\nconsideration, but it is of a nature fit only for personal communication.\r\nI therefore conclude, with again entreating Your Royal Highness to\r\ncontinue and extend the indulgence which the imperfections in my\r\ncharacter have so often received from you, and yet to be assured that\r\nthere never did exist to Monarch, Prince, or man, a firmer or purer\r\nattachment than I feel, and to my death shall feel, to you, my gracious\r\nPrince and Master.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF THE THEATRE OF DRURY-LANE BY FIRE.--MR. WHITBREAD.--PLAN\r\nFOR A THIRD THEATRE.--ILLNESS OF THE KING.--REGENCY. LORD OBEY AND LORD\r\nGRENVILLE.--CONDUCT OF MR. SHERIDAN.--HIS VINDICATION OF HIMSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the details of the embarrassments of Drury-Lane Theatre, I have\r\nendeavored, as little as possible, to encumber the attention of the\r\nreader. This part of my subject would, indeed, require a volume to\r\nitself. The successive partnerships entered into with Mr. Grubb and Mr.\r\nRichardson,--the different Trust-deeds for the general and individual\r\nproperty,--the various creations of shares,--the controversies between\r\nthe Trustees and Proprietors, as to the obligations of the Deed of 1793,\r\nwhich ended in a Chancery-suit in 1799,--the perpetual entanglements of\r\nthe property which Sheridan's private debts occasioned, and which even\r\nthe friendship and skill of Mr. Adam were wearied out in endeavoring to\r\nrectify,--all this would lead to such a mass of details and\r\ncorrespondence as, though I have waded through it myself, it is by no\r\nmeans necessary to inflict upon others.\r\n\r\nThe great source of the involvements, both of Sheridan himself and of the\r\nconcern, is to be found in the enormous excess of the expense of\r\nrebuilding the Theatre in 1793, over the amount stated by the architect\r\nin his estimate. This amount was 75,000_l_.; and the sum of\r\n150,000£. then raised by subscription, would, it was calculated, in\r\naddition to defraying this charge, pay off also the mortgage-debts with\r\nwhich the Theatre was encumbered. It was soon found, however, that the\r\nexpense of building the House alone would exceed the whole amount raised\r\nby subscription; and, notwithstanding the advance of a considerable sum\r\nbeyond the estimate, the Theatre was delivered in n very unfinished state\r\ninto the hands of the proprietors,--only part of the mortgage-debts was\r\npaid off, and, altogether a debt of 70,000£ was left upon the property.\r\nThis debt Mr. Sheridan and the other proprietors took, voluntarily, and,\r\nas it has been thought, inconsiderately, upon themselves,--the builders,\r\nby their contracts, having no legal claim upon them,--and the payment of\r\nit being at various times enforced, not only against the theatre, but\r\nagainst the private property of Mr. Sheridan, involved both in a degree\r\nof embarrassment from which there appeared no hope of extricating them.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of this luckless property,--and it would have been\r\ndifficult to imagine any change for the worse that could befall\r\nit,--when, early in the present year, an event occurred, that seemed to\r\nfill up at once the measure of its ruin. On the night of the 24th of\r\nFebruary, while the House of Commons was occupied with Mr. Ponsonby's\r\nmotion on the Conduct of the War in Spain, and Mr. Sheridan was in\r\nattendance, with the intention, no doubt, of speaking, the House was\r\nsuddenly illuminated by a blaze of light; and, the Debate being\r\ninterrupted, it was ascertained that the Theatre of Drury-Lane was on\r\nfire. A motion was made to adjourn; but Mr. Sheridan said with much\r\ncalmness, that \"whatever might be the extent of the private calamity, he\r\nhoped it would not interfere with the public business of the country.\" He\r\nthen left the House; and, proceeding to Drury-Lane, witnessed, with a\r\nfortitude which strongly interested all who observed him, the entire\r\ndestruction of his property. [Footnote: It is said that, as he sat at the\r\nPiazza Coffee-house, during the fire, taking some refreshment, a friend\r\nof his having remarked on the philosophic calmness with which he bore his\r\nmisfortune, Sheridan answered, \"A man may surely be allowed to take a\r\nglass of wine _by his own fire-side._\"\r\n\r\nWithout vouching for the authenticity or novelty of this anecdote, (which\r\nmay have been, for aught I know, like the wandering Jew, a regular\r\nattendant upon all fires, since the time of Hierocles,) I give it as I\r\nheard it.]\r\n\r\nAmong his losses on the occasion there was one which, from being\r\nassociated with feelings of other times, may have affected him, perhaps,\r\nmore deeply than many that were far more serious. A harpsichord, that had\r\nbelonged to his first wife, and had long survived her sweet voice in\r\nsilent widowhood, was, with other articles of furniture that had been\r\nmoved from Somerset-House to the Theatre, lost in the flames.\r\n\r\nThe ruin thus brought upon this immense property seemed, for a time,\r\nbeyond all hope of retrieval. The embarrassments of the concern were\r\nknown to have been so great, and such a swarm of litigious claims lay\r\nslumbering under those ashes, that it is not surprising the public should\r\nhave been slow and unwilling to touch them. Nothing, indeed, short of the\r\nintrepid zeal of Mr. Whitbread could have ventured upon the task of\r\nremedying so complex a calamity; nor could any industry less persevering\r\nhave compassed the miracle of rebuilding and re-animating that edifice,\r\namong the many-tongued claims that beset and perplexed his enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the following interesting letter to him from Sheridan, we trace the\r\nfirst steps of his friendly interference on the occasion:--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR WHITHBREAD,\r\n\r\n\"Procrastination is always the consequence of an indolent man's resolving\r\nto write a long detailed letter, upon any subject, however important to\r\nhimself, or whatever may be the confidence he has in the friend he\r\nproposes to write to. To this must be attributed your having escaped the\r\nstatement I threatened you with in my last letter, and the brevity with\r\nwhich I now propose to call your attention to the serious, and, to me,\r\nmost important request, contained in this,--reserving all I meant to have\r\nwritten for personal communication.\r\n\r\n\"I pay you no compliment when I say that, without comparison, you are the\r\nman living, in my estimation, the most disposed and the most competent to\r\nbestow a portion of your time and ability to assist the call of\r\nfriendship,--on the condition that that call shall be proved to be made\r\nin a cause just and honorable, and in every respect entitled to your\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\"On this ground alone I make my application to you. You said, some time\r\nsince, in my house, but in a careless conversation only, that you would\r\nbe a Member of a Committee for rebuilding Drury-Lane Theatre, if it would\r\nserve me; and, indeed, you very kindly suggested, yourself, that these\r\nwere more persons disposed to assist that object than I might be aware\r\nof. I most thankfully accept the offer of your interference, and am\r\nconvinced of the benefits your friendly exertions are competent to\r\nproduce. I have worked the whole subject in my own mind, and see a clear\r\nway to retrieve a great property, at least to my son and his family, if\r\nmy plan meets the support I hope it will appear to merit.\r\n\r\n\"Writing thus to you in the sincerity of private friendship, and the\r\nreliance I place on my opinion of your character, I need not ask of you,\r\nthough eager and active in politics as you are, not to be severe in\r\ncriticising my palpable neglect of all parliamentary duty. It would not\r\nbe easy to explain to you, or even to make you comprehend, or any one in\r\nprosperous and affluent plight, the private difficulties I have to\r\nstruggle with. My mind, and the resolute independence belonging to it,\r\nhas not been in the least subdued by the late calamity; but the\r\nconsequences arising from it have more engaged and embarrassed me than,\r\nperhaps, I have been willing to allow. It has been a principle of my\r\nlife, persevered in through great difficulties, never to borrow money of\r\na private friend and this resolution I would starve rather than violate.\r\nOf course, I except the political aid of election-subscription. When I\r\nask you to take a part in the settlement of my shattered affairs, I ask\r\nyou only to do so after a previous investigation of every part of the\r\npast circumstances which relate to the trust I wish you to accept, in\r\nconjunction with those who wish to serve me, and to whom I think you\r\ncould not object. I may be again seized with an illness as alarming as\r\nthat I lately experienced. Assist me in relieving my mind from the\r\ngreatest affliction that such a situation can again produce,--the fear of\r\nothers suffering by my death.\r\n\r\n\"To effect this little more is necessary than some resolution on my part,\r\nand the active superintending advice of a mind like yours.\r\n\r\n\"Thus far on paper. I will see you next ----, and therefore will not\r\ntrouble you for a written reply.\"\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the opening which the destruction of Drury-Lane seemed to\r\noffer to free adventure in theatrical property, a project was set on foot\r\nfor the establishment of a Third Great Theatre, which, being backed by\r\nmuch of the influence and wealth of the city of London, for some time\r\nthreatened destruction to the monopoly that had existed so long. But, by\r\nthe exertions of Mr. Sheridan and his friends, this scheme was defeated,\r\nand a Bill for the erection of Drury-Lane Theatre by subscription, and\r\nfor the incorporation of the subscribers, was passed through Parliament.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Sheridan himself would have had no objection to a Third Theatre,\r\nif held by a Joint Grant to the Proprietors of the other two, appears not\r\nonly from his speeches and petitions on the subject at this time, but\r\nfrom the following Plan for such an establishment, drawn up by him, some\r\nyears before, and intended to be submitted to the consideration of the\r\nProprietors of both Houses:--\r\n\r\n\"GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n\"According to your desire, the plan of the proposed Assistant Theatre, is\r\nhere explained in writing for your further consideration.\r\n\r\n\"From our situations in the Theatres Royal of Drury-Lane and\r\nCovent-Garden we have had opportunities of observing many circumstances\r\nrelative to our general property, which must have escaped those who do\r\nnot materially interfere in the management of that property. One point in\r\nparticular has lately weighed extremely in our opinions, which is, an\r\napprehension of a new Theatre being erected for some species or other of\r\ndramatic entertainment. Were this event to take place on an opposing\r\ninterest, our property would sink in value one-half, and in all\r\nprobability, the contest that would ensue would speedily end in the\r\nabsolute ruin of one of the present established Theatres. We have reason,\r\nit is true, from His Majesty's gracious patronage to the present Houses,\r\nto hope, that a Third patent for a winter Theatre is not easily to be\r\nobtained; but the motives which appear to call for one are so many, (and\r\nthose of such a nature, as to increase every day,) that we cannot, on the\r\nmaturest consideration of the subject, divest ourselves of the dread that\r\nsuch an event may not be very remote. With this apprehension before us,\r\nwe have naturally fallen into a joint consideration of the means of\r\npreventing so fatal a blow to the present Theatres, or of deriving a\r\ngeneral advantage from a circumstance which might otherwise be our ruin.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the leading motives for the establishment of a Third Theatre are\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n\"1st. The great extent of the town and increased residence of a higher\r\nclass of people, who, on account of many circumstances, seldom frequent\r\nthe Theatre.\r\n\r\n\"2d. The distant situation of the Theatres from the politer streets, and\r\nthe difficulty with which ladies reach their carriages or chairs.\r\n\r\n\"3d. The small number of side-boxes, where only, by the uncontrollable\r\ninfluence of fashion, ladies of any rank can be induced to sit.\r\n\r\n\"4th. The earliness of the hour, which renders it absolutely impossible\r\nfor those who attend on Parliament, live at any distance, or, indeed, for\r\nany person who dines at the prevailing hour, to reach the Theatre before\r\nthe performance is half over.\r\n\r\n\"These considerations have lately been strongly urged to me by many\r\nleading persons of rank. There has also prevailed, as appears by the\r\nnumber of private plays at gentlemen's seats, an unusual fashion for\r\ntheatrical entertainments among the politer class of people; and it is\r\nnot to be wondered at that they, feeling themselves, (from the causes\r\nabove enumerated,) in a manner, excluded from our Theatres, should\r\npersevere in an endeavor to establish some plan of similar entertainment,\r\non principles of superior elegance and accommodation.\r\n\r\n\"In proof of this disposition, and the effects to be apprehended from it,\r\nwe need but instance one fact, among many, which might be produced, and\r\nthat is the well-known circumstance of a subscription having actually\r\nbeen begun last winter, with very powerful patronage, for the importation\r\nof a French company of comedians, a scheme which, though it might not\r\nhave answered to the undertaking, would certainly have been the\r\nfoundation of other entertainments, whose opposition we should speedily\r\nhave experienced. The question, then, upon a full view of our situation,\r\nappears to be, whether the Proprietors of the present Theatres will\r\ncontentedly wait till some other person takes advantage of the prevailing\r\nwish for a Third Theatre, or, having the remedy in their power, profit by\r\na turn of fashion which they cannot control.\r\n\r\n\"A full conviction that the latter is the only line of conduct which can\r\ngive security to the Patents of Drury-Lane and Covent-Garden Theatres,\r\nand yield a probability of future advantage in the exercise of them, has\r\nprompted us to endeavor at modelling this plan, on which we conceive\r\nthose Theatres may unite in the support of a Third, to the general and\r\nmutual advantage of all the Proprietors.\r\n\r\n\"PROPOSALS.\r\n\r\n\"The Proprietors of the Theatre-Royal in Covent-Garden appear to be\r\npossessed of two Patents, for the privilege of acting plays, &c., under\r\none of which the above-mentioned Theatre is opened,--the other lying\r\ndormant and useless;--it is proposed that this dormant Patent shall be\r\nexercised, (with His Majesty's approbation,) in order to license the\r\ndramatic performance of the new Theatre to be erected.\r\n\r\n\"It is proposed that the performances of this new Theatre shall be\r\nsupported from the united establishments of the two present Theatres, so\r\nthat the unemployed part of each company may exert themselves for the\r\nadvantage of the whole.\r\n\r\n\"As the object of this Assistant Theatre will be to reimburse the\r\nProprietors of the other two, at the full season, for the expensive\r\nestablishment they are obliged to maintain when the town is almost empty,\r\nit is proposed, that the scheme of business to be adopted in the new\r\nTheatre shall differ as much as possible from that of the other two, and\r\nthat the performances at the new house shall be exhibited at a superior\r\nprice, and shall commence at a later hour.\r\n\r\n\"The Proposers will undertake to provide a Theatre for the purpose, in a\r\nproper situation, and on the following terms:--If they engage a Theatre\r\nto be built, being the property of the builder or builders, it must be\r\nfor an agreed on rent, with security for a term of years. In this case\r\nthe Proprietors of the two present Theatres shall jointly and severally\r\nengage in the whole of the risk; and the Proposers are ready, on\r\nequitable terms, to undertake the management of it. But, if the Proposers\r\nfind themselves enabled, either on their own credit, or by the assistance\r\nof their friends, or on a plan of subscription, the mode being devised,\r\nand the security given by themselves, to become the builders of the\r\nTheatre, the interest in the building will, in that case, be the property\r\nof the Proposers, and they will undertake to demand no rent for the\r\nperformances therein to be exhibited for the mutual advantage of the two\r\npresent Theatres.\r\n\r\n\"The Proposers will, in this case, conducting the business under the\r\ndormant Patent above mentioned, bind themselves, that no theatrical\r\nentertainments, as plays, farces, pantomimes, or English operas, shall at\r\nany time be exhibited in this Theatre but for the general advantage of\r\nthe Proprietors of the two other Theatres; the Proposers reserving to\r\nthemselves any profit they can make of their building, converted to\r\npurposes distinct from the business of the Theatres.\r\n\r\n\"The Proposers, undertaking the management of the new Theatre, shall be\r\nentitled to a sum to be settled by the Proprietors at large, or by an\r\nequitable arbitration.\r\n\r\n\"It is proposed, that all the Proprietors of the two present Theatres\r\nRoyal of Drury-Lane and Covent-Garden shall share all profits from the\r\ndramatic entertainments exhibited at the new Theatre; that is, each shall\r\nbe entitled to receive a dividend in proportion to the shares he or she\r\npossesses of the present Theatres: first only deducting a certain nightly\r\nsum to be paid to the Proprietors of Covent-Garden Theatre, as a\r\nconsideration for the license furnished by the exercise of their present\r\ndormant Patent.\r\n\r\n\"'Fore Heaven! the Plan's a good Plan! I shall add a little Epilogue\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\n\"R. B. S.\"\r\n\r\n  \"'Tis now too late, and I've a letter to write\r\n  Before I go to bed,--and then, Good Night.\"\r\n\r\nIn the month of July, this year, the Installation of Lord Grenville, as\r\nChancellor of Oxford, took place, and Mr. Sheridan was among the\r\ndistinguished persons that attended the ceremony. As a number of honorary\r\ndegrees were to be conferred on the occasion, it was expected, as a\r\nmatter of course, that his name would be among those selected for that\r\ndistinction; and, to the honor of the University, it was the general wish\r\namong its leading members that such a tribute should be paid to his high\r\npolitical character. On the proposal of his name, however, (in a private\r\nmeeting, I believe, held previously to the Convocation.) the words\r\n_\"Non placet\"_ were heard from two scholars, one of whom, it is\r\nsaid, had no nobler motive for his opposition than that Sheridan did not\r\npay his father's tithes very regularly. Several efforts were made to win\r\nover these dissentients; and the Rev. Mr. Ingram delivered an able and\r\nliberal Latin speech, in which he indignantly represented the shame that\r\nit would bring on the University, if such a name as that of Sheridan\r\nshould be _\"clam subductum\"_ from the list. The two scholars,\r\nhowever, were immovable; and nothing remained but to give Sheridan\r\nintimation of their intended opposition, so as to enable him to decline\r\nthe honor of having his name proposed. On his appearance, afterwards, in\r\nthe Theatre, a burst of acclamation broke forth, with a general cry of\r\n\"Mr. Sheridan among the Doctors,--Sheridan among the Doctors;\" in\r\ncompliance with which he was passed to the seat occupied by the Honorary\r\nGraduates, and sat, in unrobed distinction, among them, during the whole\r\nof the ceremonial. Few occurrences, of a public nature, ever gave him\r\nmore pleasure than this reception.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year 1810, the malady, with which the king had been\r\nthrice before afflicted, returned; and, after the usual adjournments of\r\nParliament, it was found necessary to establish a Regency. On the\r\nquestion of the second adjournment, Mr. Sheridan took a line directly\r\nopposed to that of his party, and voted with the majority. That in this\r\nstep he did not act from any previous concert with the Prince, appears\r\nfrom the following letter, addressed by him to His Royal Highness on the\r\nsubject, and containing particulars which will prepare the mind of the\r\nreader to judge more clearly of the events that followed:--\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I felt infinite satisfaction when I was apprised that Your Royal\r\nHighness had been far from disapproving the line of conduct I had\r\npresumed to pursue, on the last question of adjournment in the House of\r\nCommons. Indeed, I never had a moment's doubt but that Your Royal\r\nHighness would give me credit that I was actuated on that, as I shall on\r\nevery other occasion through my existence, by no possible motive but the\r\nmost sincere and unmixed desire to look to Your Royal Highness's honor\r\nand true interest, as the objects of my political life,--directed, as I\r\nam sure your efforts will ever be, to the essential interests of the\r\nCountry and the Constitution. To this line of conduct I am prompted by\r\nevery motive of personal gratitude, and confirmed by every opportunity,\r\nwhich peculiar circumstances and long experience have afforded me, of\r\njudging of your heart and understanding,--to the superior excellence of\r\nwhich, (beyond all, I believe, that ever stood in your rank and high\r\nrelation to society,) I fear not to advance my humble testimony, because\r\nI scruple not to say for myself, that I am no flatterer, and that I never\r\nfound that to _become_ one was the road to your real regard.\r\n\r\n\"I state thus much because it has been under the influence of these\r\nfeelings that I have not felt myself warranted, (without any previous\r\ncommunication with Your Royal Highness,) to follow implicitly the\r\ndictates of others, in whom, however they may be my superiors in many\r\nqualities, I can subscribe to no superiority as to devoted attachment and\r\nduteous affection to Your Royal Highness, or in that practical knowledge\r\nof the public mind and character, upon which alone must be built that\r\npopular and personal estimation of Your Royal Highness, so necessary to\r\nyour future happiness and glory, and to the prosperity of the nation you\r\nare destined to rule over.\r\n\r\n\"On these grounds, I saw no policy or consistency in unnecessarily giving\r\na general sanction to the examination of the physicians before the\r\nCouncil, and then attempting, on the question of adjournment, to hold\r\nthat examination as naught. On these grounds, I have ventured to doubt\r\nthe wisdom or propriety of any endeavor, (if any such endeavor has been\r\nmade,) to induce Your Royal Highness, during so critical a moment, to\r\nstir an inch from the strong reserved post you have chosen, or give the\r\nslightest public demonstration of any future intended political\r\npreferences;--convinced as I was that the rule of conduct you had\r\nprescribed to yourself was precisely that which was gaining you the\r\ngeneral heart, and rendering it impracticable for any quarter to succeed\r\nin annexing unworthy conditions to that most difficult situation, which\r\nyou were probably so soon to be called on to accept.\r\n\r\n\"I may, Sir, have been guilty of error of judgment in both these\r\nrespects, differing, as I fear I have done, from those whom I am bound so\r\nhighly to respect; but, at the same time, I deem it no presumption to say\r\nthat, until better instructed, I feel a strong confidence in the justness\r\nof my own view of the subject; and simply because of this--I am sure that\r\nthe decisions of that judgment, be they sound or mistaken, have not, at\r\nleast, been rashly taken up, but were founded on deliberate zeal for your\r\nservice and glory, unmixed, I will confidently say, with any one selfish\r\nobject or political purpose of my own.\"\r\n\r\nThe same limitations and restrictions that Mr. Pitt proposed in 1789,\r\nwere, upon the same principles, adopted by the present Minister: nor did\r\nthe Opposition differ otherwise from their former line of argument, than\r\nby omitting altogether that claim of Right for the Prince, which Mr. Fox\r\nhad, in the proceedings of 1789, asserted. The event that ensued is\r\nsufficiently well known. To the surprise of the public, (who expected,\r\nperhaps, rather than wished, that the Coalesced Party of which Lord Grey\r\nand Lord Grenville were the chiefs, should now succeed to power,) Mr.\r\nPerceval and his colleagues were informed by the Regent that it was the\r\nintention of His Royal Highness to continue them still in office.\r\n\r\nThe share taken by Mr. Sheridan in the transactions that led to this\r\ndecision, is one of those passages of his political life upon which the\r\ncriticism of his own party has been most severely exercised, and into the\r\ndetails of which I feel most difficulty in entering:--because, however\r\ncurious it may be to penetrate into these _\"postscenia\"_ of public\r\nlife, it seems hardly delicate, while so many of the chief actors are\r\nstill upon the stage. As there exists, however, a Paper drawn up by Mr.\r\nSheridan, containing what he considered a satisfactory defence of his\r\nconduct on this occasion, I should ill discharge my duty towards his\r\nmemory, were I, from any scruples or predilections of my own, to deprive\r\nhim of the advantage of a, statement, on which he appears to have relied\r\nso confidently for his vindication.\r\n\r\nBut, first,--in order fully to understand the whole course of feelings\r\nand circumstances, by which not only Sheridan, but his Royal Master, (for\r\ntheir cause is, in a great degree, identified,) were for some time past,\r\npredisposed towards the line of conduct which they now pursued,--it will\r\nbe necessary to recur to a few antecedent events.\r\n\r\nBy the death of Mr. Fox the chief personal tie that connected the\r\nHeir-Apparent with the party of that statesman was broken. The political\r\nidentity of the party itself had, even before that event, been, in a\r\ngreat degree, disturbed by a coalition against which Sheridan had always\r\nmost strongly protested, and to which the Prince, there is every reason\r\nto believe, was by no means friendly. Immediately after the death of Mr.\r\nFox, His Royal Highness made known his intentions of withdrawing from all\r\npersonal interference in politics; and, though still continuing his\r\nsanction to the remaining Ministry, expressed himself as no longer\r\ndesirous of being considered \"a party man.\" [Footnote: This is the phrase\r\nused by the Prince himself, in a Letter addressed to a Noble Lord,(not\r\nlong after the dismissal of the Grenville Ministry,) for the purpose of\r\nvindicating his own character from some imputations cast upon it, in\r\nconsequence of an interview which he had lately had with the King. This\r\nimportant exposition of the feelings of His Royal Highness, which, more\r\nthan any thing, throws light upon his subsequent conduct, was drawn up by\r\nSheridan; and I had hoped that I should have been able to lay it before\r\nthe reader:--but the liberty of perusing the Letter is all that has been\r\nallowed me.] During the short time that these Ministers continued in\r\noffice, the understanding between them and the Prince was by no means of\r\nthat cordial and confidential kind, which had been invariably maintained\r\nduring the life-time of Mr. Fox. On the contrary, the impression on the\r\nmind, of His Royal Highness, us well as on those of his immediate friends\r\nin the Ministry, Lord Moira and Mr. Sheridan, was, that a cold neglect\r\nhad succeeded to the confidence with which they had hitherto been\r\ntreated; and that, neither in their opinions nor feelings, were they any\r\nlonger sufficiently consulted or considered. The very measure, by which\r\nthe Ministers ultimately lost their places, was, it appears, one of those\r\nwhich the Illustrious Personage in question neither conceived himself to\r\nhave been sufficiently consulted upon before its adoption, nor approved\r\nof afterwards.\r\n\r\nSuch were the gradual loosenings of a bond, which at no time had promised\r\nmuch permanence; and such the train of feelings and circumstances which,\r\n(combining with certain prejudices in the Royal mind against one of the\r\nchief leaders of the party,) prepared the way for that result by which\r\nthe Public was surprised in 1811, and the private details of which I\r\nshall now, as briefly as possible, relate.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Bill for regulating the office of Regent had passed the\r\ntwo Houses, the Prince, who, till then, had maintained a strict reserve\r\nwith respect to his intentions, signified, through Mr. Adam, his pleasure\r\nthat Lord Grenville should wait upon him. He then, in the most gracious\r\nmanner, expressed to that Noble Lord his wish that he should, in\r\nconjunction with Lord Grey, prepare the Answer which his Royal Highness\r\nwas, in a few days, to return to the Address of the Houses. The same\r\nconfidential task was entrusted also to Lord Moira, with an expressed\r\ndesire that he should consult with Lord Grey and Lord Grenville on the\r\nsubject. But this co-operation, as I understand, the two Noble Lords\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nOne of the embarrassing consequences of Coalitions now appeared. The\r\nrecorded opinions of Lord Grenville on the Regency Question differed\r\nwholly and in principle not only from those of his coadjutor in this\r\ntask, but from those of the Royal person himself, whose sentiments he was\r\ncalled upon to interpret. In this difficulty, the only alternative that\r\nremained was so to neutralize the terms of the Answer upon the great\r\npoint of difference, as to preserve the consistency of the Royal speaker,\r\nwithout at the same time compromising that of his Noble adviser. It\r\nrequired, of course, no small art and delicacy thus to throw into the\r\nshade that distinctive opinion of Whigism, which Burke had clothed in his\r\nimperishable language in 1789, and which Fox had solemnly bequeathed to\r\nthe Party, when\r\n\r\n    \"in his upward flight\r\n  He left his mantle there.\"\r\n[Footnote: Joanna Baithe]\r\n\r\nThe Answer, drawn up by the Noble Lords, did not, it must be confessed,\r\nsurmount this difficulty very skilfully. The assertion of the Prince's\r\nconsistency was confined to two meagre sentences, in the first of which\r\nHis Royal Highness was made to say:--\"With respect to the proposed\r\nlimitation of the authority to be entrusted to me, I retain my former\r\nopinion:\"--and in the other, the expression of any decided opinion upon\r\nthe Constitutional point is thus evaded:--\"For such a purpose no\r\nrestraint can be necessary to be imposed upon me.\" Somewhat less vague\r\nand evasive, however, was the justification of the opinion opposed to\r\nthat of the Prince, in the following sentence:--\"That day when I may\r\nrestore to the King those powers, which _as belonging only to him_,\r\n[Footnote: The words which I have put in italics in these quotations,\r\nare, in the same manner, underlined in Sheridan's copy of the\r\nPaper,--doubtless, from a similar view of their import to that which I\r\nhave taken.] are in his name and in his behalf,\" &c. &c. This, it will be\r\nrecollected, is precisely the doctrine which, on the great question of\r\nlimiting the Prerogative, Mr. Fox attributed to the Tories. In another\r\npassage, the Whig opinion of the Prince was thus tamely\r\nsurrendered:--\"Conscious that, whatever _degree_ of confidence you\r\nmay _think fit_ to repose in me,\" &c. [Footnote: On the back of\r\nSheridan's own copy of this Answer, I find, written by him, the following\r\nwords \"Grenville's and Grey's proposed Answer from the Prince to the\r\nAddress of the two Houses,--very flimsy, and attempting to cover\r\nGrenville's conduct and consistency in supporting the present\r\nRestrictions at the expense of the Prince.\"] The Answer, thus\r\nconstructed, was, by the two Noble Lords, transmitted through Mr. Adam,\r\nto the Prince, who, \"strongly objecting, (as we are told), to almost\r\nevery part of it,\" acceded to the suggestion of Sheridan, whom he\r\nconsulted on the subject, that a new form of Answer should be immediately\r\nsketched out, and submitted to the consideration of Lord Grey and Lord\r\nGrenville. There was no time to be lost, as the Address of the Houses was\r\nto be received the following day. Accordingly, Mr. Adam and Mr. Sheridan\r\nproceeded that night, with the new draft of the Answer to Holland-House,\r\nwhere, after a warm discussion upon the subject with Lord Grey, which\r\nended unsatisfactorily to both parties, the final result was that the\r\nAnswer drawn up by the Prince and Sheridan was adopted.--Such is the bare\r\noutline of this transaction, the circumstances of which will be found\r\nfully detailed in the Statement that shall presently be given.\r\n\r\nThe accusation against Sheridan is, that chiefly to his undermining\r\ninfluence the view taken by the Prince of the Paper of these Noble Lords\r\nis to be attributed; and that not only was he censurable in a\r\nconstitutional point of view, for thus interfering between the Sovereign\r\nand his responsible advisers, but that he had been also guilty of an act\r\nof private perfidy, in endeavoring to represent the Answer drawn up by\r\nthese Noble Lords, as an attempt to sacrifice the consistency and dignity\r\nof their Royal Master to the compromise of opinions and principles which\r\nthey had entered into themselves.\r\n\r\nUnder the impression that such were the nature and motives of his\r\ninterference, Lord Grey and Lord Grenville, on the 11th of January, (the\r\nday on which the Answer substituted for their own was delivered),\r\npresented a joint Representation to the Regent, in which they stated that\r\n\"the circumstances which had occurred, respecting His Royal Highness's\r\nAnswer to the two Houses, had induced them, most humbly, to solicit\r\npermission to submit to His Royal Highness the following considerations,\r\nwith the undisguised sincerity which the occasion seemed to require, but,\r\nwith every expression that could best convey their respectful duty and\r\ninviolable attachment. When His Royal Highness, (they continued), did\r\nLord Grenville the honor, through Mr. Adam, to command his attendance, it\r\nwas distinctly expressed to him, that His Royal Highness had condescended\r\nto select him, in conjunction with Lord Grey, to be consulted with, as\r\nthe public and responsible advisers of that Answer; and Lord Grenville\r\ncould never forget the gracious terms in which His Royal Highness had the\r\ngoodness to lay these his orders upon him. It was also on the same\r\ngrounds of public and responsible advice, that  Lord Grey, honored in\r\nlike manner by the most gracious expression of His Royal Highness's\r\nconfidence on this subject, applied himself to the consideration of it\r\nconjointly with Lord Grenville. They could not but feel the difficulty of\r\nthe undertaking, which required them to reconcile two objects essentially\r\ndifferent,--to uphold and distinctly to manifest that unshaken adherence\r\nto His Royal Highness's past and present opinion, which consistency and\r\nhonor required, but to conciliate, at the same time, the feelings of the\r\ntwo Houses, by expressions of confidence and affection, and to lay the\r\nfoundation of that good understanding between His Royal Highness and the\r\nParliament, the establishment of which must be the first wish of every\r\nman who is truly attached to His Royal Highness, and who knows the value\r\nof the Constitution of his country. Lord Grey and Lord Grenville were far\r\nfrom the presumption of believing that their humble endeavors for the\r\nexecution of so difficult a task might not be susceptible of many and\r\ngreat amendments.\r\n\r\n\"The draft, (their Lordships said), which they humbly submitted to His\r\nRoyal Highness was considered by them as open to every remark which might\r\noccur to His Royal Highness's better judgment. On every occasion, but\r\nmore especially in the preparation of His Royal Highness's first act of\r\ngovernment, it would have been no less their desire than their duty to\r\nhave profited by all such objections, and to have labored to accomplish,\r\nin the best manner they were able, every command which His Royal Highness\r\nmight have been pleased to lay upon them. Upon the objects to be obtained\r\nthere could be no difference of sentiment. These, such as above\r\ndescribed, were, they confidently believed, not less important in His\r\nRoyal Highness's view of the subject than in that which they themselves\r\nhad ventured to express. But they would be wanting in that sincerity and\r\nopenness by which they could alone hope, however imperfectly, to make any\r\nreturn to that gracious confidence with which His Royal Highness had\r\ncondescended to honor them, if they suppressed the expression of their\r\ndeep concern, in finding that their humble endeavors in His Royal\r\nHighness's service had been submitted to the judgment of another person,\r\nby whose advice His Royal Highness had been guided in his final decision,\r\non a matter on which they alone had, however unworthily, been honored\r\nwith His Royal Highness's commands. It was their most sincere and ardent\r\nwish that, in the arduous station which His Royal Highness was about to\r\nfill, he might have the benefit of the public advice and responsible\r\nservices of those men, whoever they might be, by whom His Royal\r\nHighness's glory and the interests of the country could best be promoted.\r\nIt would be with unfeigned distrust of their own means of discharging\r\nsuch duties that they could, in any case, venture to undertake them; and,\r\nin this humble but respectful representation which they had presumed to\r\nmake of their feelings on this occasion, they were conscious of being\r\nactuated not less by their dutiful and grateful attachment to His Royal\r\nHighness, than by those principles of constitutional responsibility, the\r\nmaintenance of which they deemed essential to any hope of a successful\r\nadministration of the public interests.\"\r\n\r\nOn receiving this Representation, in which, it must be confessed, there\r\nwas more of high spirit and dignity than of worldly wisdom, [Footnote: To\r\nthe pure and dignified character of the Noble Whig associated in this\r\nRemonstrance, it is unnecessary for me to say how heartily I bear\r\ntestimony. The only fault, indeed, of this distinguished person is, that\r\nknowing but one high course of conduct for himself, he impatiently\r\nresents any sinking from that pitch in others. Then, only, in his true\r\nstation, when placed between the People and the Crown, as one of those\r\nfortresses that ornament and defend the frontier of Democracy, he has\r\nshown that he can but ill suit the dimensions of his spirit to the narrow\r\navenues of a Court, or, like that Pope who stooped to look for the keys\r\nof St. Peter, accommodate his natural elevation to the pursuit of\r\nofficial power. All the pliancy of his nature is, indeed, reserved for\r\nprivate life, where the repose of the valley succeeds to the grandeur of\r\nthe mountain, and where the lofty statesman gracefully subsides into the\r\ngentle husband and father, and the frank, social friend. The eloquence of\r\nLord Grey, more than that of any other person, brings to mind what\r\nQuintilian says of the great and noble orator, Messala:--\"_Quodammodo\r\nprae se ferens in dicendo nobilitatem suam_.\"] His Royal Highness lost\r\nno time in communicating it to Sheridan, who, proud of the influence\r\nattributed to him by the Noble writers, and now more than ever stimulated\r\nto make them feel its weight, employed the whole force of his shrewdness\r\nand ridicule [Footnote: He called rhymes also to his aid, as appears by\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n  \"_An Address to the Prince_, 1811.\r\n\r\n  \"In all humility we crave\r\n  Our Regent may become our slave,\r\n  And being so, we trust that HE\r\n  Will thank us for our loyalty.\r\n  Then, if he'll help us to pull down\r\n  His Father's dignity and Crown,\r\n  We'll make him, in some time to come,\r\n  The greatest Prince in Christendom.\"] in exposing the stately tone of\r\ndictation which, according to his view, was assumed throughout this Paper,\r\nand in picturing to the Prince the state of tutelage he might expect under\r\nMinisters who began thus early with their lectures. Such suggestions, even\r\nif less ably urged, were but too sure of a willing audience in the ears to\r\nwhich they were adressed. Shortly after, His Royal Highness paid a visit\r\nto Windsor, where the Queen and another Royal Personage completed what had\r\nbeen so skilfully begun; and the important resolution was forthwith taken\r\nto retain Mr. Perceval and his colleagues in the Ministry.\r\n\r\nI shall now give the Statement of the whole transaction, which Mr.\r\nSheridan thought it necessary to address, in his own defence, to Lord\r\nHolland, and of which a rough and a fair copy have been found carefully\r\npreserved among his papers:--\r\n\r\n_Queen-Street, January_ 15, 1811.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR HOLLAND,\r\n\r\n\"As you have been already apprised by His Royal Highness the Prince that\r\nhe thought it becoming the frankness of his character, and consistent\r\nwith the fairness and openness of proceeding due to any of his servants\r\nwhose conduct appears to have incurred the disapprobation of Lord Grey\r\nand Lord Grenville, to communicate their representations on the subject\r\nto the person so censured, I am confident you will give me credit for the\r\npain I must have felt, to find myself an object of suspicion, or likely,\r\nin the slightest degree, to become the cause of any temporary\r\nmisunderstanding between His Royal Highness amid those distinguished\r\ncharacters, whom His Royal Highness appears to destine to those\r\nresponsible situations, which must in all public matters entitle them to\r\nhis exclusive confidence.\r\n\r\n\"I shall as briefly as I can state the circumstances of the fact, so\r\ndistinctly referred to in the following passage of the Noble Lord's\r\nRepresentation:--\r\n\r\n\"'But they would be wanting in that sincerity and openness by which they\r\ncan alone hope, however imperfectly, to make any return to that gracious\r\nconfidence with which Your Royal Highness has condescended to honor them,\r\nif they suppressed the expression of their deep concern in finding that\r\ntheir humble endeavors in Your Royal Highness's service have been\r\nsubmitted to the judgment of another person, _by whose advice_ Your\r\nRoyal Highness has been guided in your final decision on a matter in\r\nwhich they alone had, however unworthily, been honored with Your Royal\r\nHighness's commands.'\r\n\r\n\"I must premise, that from my first intercourse with the Prince during\r\nthe present distressing emergency, such conversations as he may have\r\nhonored me with have been communications of resolutions already formed on\r\nhis part, and not of matter referred to consultation or submitted to\r\n_advice_. I know that my declining to vote for the further\r\nadjournment of the Privy Council's examination of the physicians gave\r\noffence to some, and was considered as a difference from the party I as\r\nrightly esteemed to belong to. The intentions of the leaders of the party\r\nupon that question were in no way distinctly known to me; my secession\r\nwas entirely my own act, and not only unauthorized, but perhaps\r\nunexpected by the Prince. My motives for it I took the liberty of\r\ncommunicating to His Royal Highness by letter, [Footnote: This Letter has\r\nbeen given in page 268.] the next day, and, previously to that, I had not\r\neven seen His Royal Highness since the confirmation of His Majesty's\r\nmalady.\r\n\r\n\"If I differed from those who, equally attached to His Royal Highness's\r\ninterest and honor, thought that His Royal Highness should have taken the\r\nstep which, in my humble opinion, he has since, precisely at the proper\r\nperiod, taken of sending to Lord Grenville and Lord Grey, I may certainly\r\nhave erred in forming an imperfect judgment on the occasion, but, in\r\ndoing so, I meant no disrespect to those who had taken a different view\r\nof the subject. But, with all deference, I cannot avoid adding, that\r\nexperience of the impression made on the public mind by the reserved and\r\nretired conduct which the Prince thought proper to adopt, has not shaken\r\nmy opinion of the wisdom which prompted him to that determination. But\r\nhere, again, I declare, that I must reject the presumption that any\r\nsuggestion of mine led to the rule which the Prince had prescribed to\r\nhimself. My knowledge of it being, as I before said, the communication of\r\na resolution formed on the part of His Royal Highness, and not of a\r\nproposition awaiting the advice, countenance, or corroboration, of any\r\nother person. Having thought it necessary to premise thus much, as I wish\r\nto write to you without reserve or concealment of any sort, I shall as\r\nbriefly as I can relate the facts which attended the composing the Answer\r\nitself, as far as I was concerned.\r\n\r\n\"On Sunday, or on Monday the 7th instant, I mentioned to Lord Moira, or\r\nto Adam, that the Address of the two Houses would come very quickly upon\r\nthe Prince, and that he should be prepared with his Answer, without\r\nentertaining the least idea of meddling with the subject myself, having\r\nreceived no authority from His Royal Highness to do so. Either Lord Moira\r\nor Adam informed me, before I left Carlton-House, that His Royal Highness\r\nhad directed Lord Moira to sketch an outline of the Answer proposed, and\r\nI left town. On Tuesday evening it occurred to me to try at a sketch also\r\nof the intended reply. On Wednesday morning I read it, at Carlton-House,\r\nvery hastily to Adam, before I saw the Prince. And here I must pause to\r\ndeclare, that I have entirely withdrawn from my mind any doubt, if for a\r\nmoment I ever entertained any, of the perfect propriety of Adam's conduct\r\nat that hurried interview; being also long convinced, as well from\r\nintercourse with him at Carlton-House as in every transaction I have\r\nwitnessed, that it is impossible for him to act otherwise than with the\r\nmost entire sincerity and honor towards all he deals with. I then read\r\nthe Paper I had put together to the Prince,--the most essential part of\r\nit literally consisting of sentiments and expressions, which had fallen\r\nfrom the Prince himself in different conversations; and I read it to him\r\nwithout _having once heard Lord Grenville's name_ even mentioned as\r\nin any way connected with the Answer proposed to be submitted to the\r\nPrince. On the contrary, indeed, I was under an impression that the\r\nframing this Answer was considered as the single act which it would be an\r\nunfair and embarrassing task to require the performance of from Lord\r\nGrenville. The Prince approved the Paper I read to him, objecting,\r\nhowever, to some additional paragraphs of my own, and altering others. In\r\nthe course of his observations, he cursorily mentioned that Lord\r\nGrenville had undertaken to sketch out his idea of a proper Answer, and\r\nthat Lord Moira had done the same,--evidently expressing himself, to my\r\napprehension, as not considering the framing of this Answer as a matter\r\nof official responsibility any where, but that it was his intention to\r\ntake the choice and decision respecting it on himself. If, however, I had\r\nknown, before I entered the Prince's apartment, that Lord Grenville and\r\nLord Grey had in any way undertaken to frame the Answer, and had thought\r\nthemselves authorized to do so, I protest the Prince would never even\r\nhave heard of the draft which I had prepared, though containing, as I\r\nbefore said, the Prince's own ideas.\r\n\r\n\"His Royal Highness having laid his commands on Adam and me to dine with\r\nhim alone on the next day, Thursday, I then, for the first time, learnt\r\nthat Lord Grey and Lord Grenville had transmitted, through Adam, a formal\r\ndraft of an Answer to be submitted to the Prince.\r\n\r\n\"Under these circumstances I thought it became me humbly to request the\r\nPrince not to refer to me, in any respect, the Paper of the Noble Lords,\r\nor to insist even on my hearing its contents; but that I might be\r\npermitted to put the draft he had received from me into the fire. The\r\nPrince, however, who had read the Noble Lords' Paper, declining to hear\r\nof this, proceeded to state, how strongly he objected to almost every\r\npart of it. The draft delivered by Adam he took a copy of himself, as Mr.\r\nAdam read it, affixing shortly, but warmly, his comments to each\r\nparagraph. Finding His Royal Highness's objections to the whole radical\r\nand insuperable, and seeing no means myself by which the Noble Lords\r\ncould change their draft, so as to meet the Prince's ideas, I ventured to\r\npropose, as the only expedient of which the time allowed, that both the\r\nPapers should be laid aside, and that a very short Answer, indeed,\r\nkeeping clear of all topics liable to disagreement, should be immediately\r\nsketched out and be submitted that night to the judgment of Lord Grey and\r\nLord Grenville. The lateness of the hour prevented any but very hasty\r\ndiscussion, and Adam and myself proceeded, by His Royal Highness's\r\norders, to your house to relate what had passed to Lord Grey. I do not\r\nmean to disguise, however, that when I found myself bound to give my\r\nopinion, I did fully assent to the force and justice of the Prince's\r\nobjections, and made other observations of my own, which I thought it my\r\nduty to do, conceiving, as I freely said, that the Paper could not have\r\nbeen drawn up but under the pressure of embarrassing difficulties, and,\r\nas I conceived also, in considerable haste.\r\n\r\n\"Before we left Carlton-House, it was agreed between Adam and myself that\r\nwe were not so strictly enjoined by the Prince, as to make it necessary\r\nfor us to communicate to the Noble Lords the marginal comments of the\r\nPrince, and we determined to withhold them. But at the meeting with Lord\r\nGrey, at your house, he appeared to me, erroneously perhaps, to decline\r\nconsidering the objections as coming from the Prince, but as originating\r\nin my suggestions. Upon this, I certainly called on Adam to produce the\r\nPrince's copy, with his notes, in His Royal Highness's own hand-writing.\r\n\r\n\"Afterwards, finding myself considerably hurt at an expression of Lord\r\nGrey's, which could only be pointed at me, and which expressed his\r\nopinion that the whole of the Paper, which he assumed me to be\r\nresponsible for, was 'drawn up in an invidious spirit,' I certainly did,\r\nwith more warmth than was, perhaps, discreet, comment on the Paper\r\nproposed to be substituted; and there ended, with no good effect, our\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\n\"Adam and I saw the Prince again that night, when His Royal Highness was\r\ngraciously pleased to meet our joint and earnest request, by striking out\r\nfrom the draft of the Answer, to which he still resolved to adhere, every\r\npassage which we conceived to be most liable to objection on the part of\r\nLord Grey and Lord Grenville.\r\n\r\n\"On the next morning, Friday,--a short time before he was to receive the\r\nAddress,--when Adam returned from the Noble Lords, with their expressed\r\ndisclaimer of the preferred Answer, altered as it was, His Royal Highness\r\nstill persevered to eradicate every remaining word which he thought might\r\nyet appear exceptionable to them, and made further alterations, although\r\nthe fair copy of the paper had been made out.\r\n\r\n\"Thus the Answer, nearly reduced to the expression of the Prince's own\r\nsuggestions, and without an opportunity of farther meeting the wishes of\r\nthe Noble Lords, was delivered by His Royal Highness, and presented by\r\nthe Deputation of the two Houses.\r\n\r\n\"I am ashamed to have been thus prolix and circumstantial, upon a matter\r\nwhich may appear to have admitted of much shorter explanation; but when\r\nmisconception has produced distrust among those, I hope, not willingly\r\ndisposed to differ, and, who can have, I equally trust, but one common\r\nobject in view in their different stations, I know no better way than by\r\nminuteness and accuracy of detail to remove whatever may have appeared\r\ndoubtful in conduct, while unexplained, or inconsistent in principle not\r\nclearly re-asserted.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my dear Lord, I have only shortly to express my own personal\r\nmortification, I will use no other word, that I should have been\r\nconsidered by any persons however high in rank, or justly entitled to\r\nhigh political pretensions, as one so little 'attached to His Royal\r\nHighness,' or so ignorant of the value 'of the Constitution of his\r\ncountry,' as to be held out to HIM, whose fairly-earned esteem I regard\r\nas the first honor and the sole reward of my political life, in the\r\ncharacter of an interested contriver of a double government, and, in some\r\nmeasure, as an apostate from all my former principles,--which have taught\r\nme, as well as the Noble Lords, that 'the maintenance of constitutional\r\nresponsibility in the ministers of the Crown is essential to any hope of\r\nsuccess in the administration of the public interest.'\r\n\r\n\"At the same time, I am most ready to admit that it could not be their\r\n_intention_ so to characterize me; but it is the direct inference\r\nwhich others must gather from the first paragraph I have quoted from\r\ntheir Representation, and an inference which, I understand, has already\r\nbeen raised in public opinion. A departure, my dear Lord, on my part,\r\nfrom upholding the principle declared by the Noble Lords, much more a\r\npresumptuous and certainly ineffectual attempt to inculcate a contrary\r\ndoctrine on the mind of the Prince of Wales, would, I am confident, lose\r\nme every particle of his favor and confidence at once and for ever. But I\r\nam yet to learn what part of my past public life,--and I challenge\r\nobservation on every part of my present proceedings,--has warranted the\r\nadoption of any such suspicion of me, or the expression of any such\r\nimputation against me. But I will dwell no longer on this point, as it\r\nrelates only to my own feelings and character; which, however, I am the\r\nmore bound to consider, as others, in my humble judgment, have so hastily\r\ndisregarded both. At the same time, I do sincerely declare, that no\r\npersonal disappointment in my own mind interferes with the respect and\r\nesteem I entertain for Lord Grenville, or in addition to those\r\nsentiments, the friendly regard I owe to Lord Grey. To Lord Grenville I\r\nhave the honor to be but very little personally known. From Lord Grey,\r\nintimately acquainted as he was with every circumstance of my conduct and\r\nprinciples in the years 1788-9, I confess I should have expected a very\r\ntardy and reluctant interpretation of any circumstance to my\r\ndisadvantage. What the nature of my endeavors were at that time, I have\r\nthe written testimonies of Mr. Fox and the Duke of Portland. To you I\r\nknow those testimonies are not necessary, and perhaps it has been my\r\nrecollection of what passed in those times that may have led me too\r\nsecurely to conceive myself above the reach even of a suspicion that I\r\ncould adopt different principles now. Such as they were they remain\r\nuntouched and unaltered. I conclude with sincerely declaring, that to see\r\nthe Prince meeting the reward which his own honorable nature, his kind\r\nand generous disposition, and his genuine devotion to the true objects of\r\nour free Constitution so well entitle him to, by being surrounded and\r\nsupported by an Administration affectionate to his person, and ambitious\r\nof gaining and meriting his entire esteem, (yet tenacious, above all\r\nthings, of the constitutional principle, that exclusive confidence must\r\nattach to the responsibility of those whom he selects to be his public\r\nservants,) I would with heartfelt satisfaction rather be a looker on of\r\nsuch a Government, giving it such humble support as might be in my power,\r\nthan be the possessor of any possible situation either of profit or\r\nambition, to be obtained by any indirectness, or by the slightest\r\ndeparture from the principles I have always professed, and which I have\r\nnow felt myself in a manner called upon to re-assert.\r\n\r\n\"I have only to add, that my respect for the Prince, and my sense of the\r\nfrankness he has shown towards me on this occasion, decide me, with all\r\nduty, to submit this letter to his perusal, before I place it in your\r\nhands; meaning it undoubtedly to be by you shown to those to whom your\r\njudgment may deem it of any consequence to communicate it.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to be, &c.\r\n\r\n\"_To Lord Holland_.\r\n\r\n(Signed)\r\n\r\n\"R. B. Sheridan\r\n\r\n\"Read and approved by the Prince, January 20, 1811.\r\n\r\n\"R.B.S.\"\r\n\r\nThough this Statement, it must be recollected, exhibits but one side of\r\nthe question, and is silent as to the part that Sheridan took after the\r\ndelivery of the Remonstrance of the two noble Lords, yet, combined with\r\npreceding events and with the insight into motives which they afford, it\r\nmay sufficiently enable the reader to form his own judgment, with respect\r\nto the conduct of the different persons concerned in the transaction.\r\nWith the better and more ostensible motives of Sheridan, there was, no\r\ndoubt, some mixture of, what the Platonists call, \"the material alluvion\"\r\nof our nature. His political repugnance to the Coalesced Leaders would\r\nhave been less strong but for the personal feelings that mingled with it;\r\nand his anxiety that the Prince should not be dictated to by others was\r\nat least equalled by his vanity in showing that he could govern him\r\nhimself. But, whatever were the precise views that impelled him to this\r\ntrial of strength, the victory which he gained in it was far more\r\nextensive than he himself had either foreseen or wished. He had meant the\r\nparty to _feel_ his power,--not to sink under it. Though privately\r\nalienated from them, on personal as well as political grounds, he knew\r\nthat, publicly he was too much identified with their ranks, ever to\r\nserve, with credit or consistency, in any other. He had, therefore, in\r\nthe ardor of undermining, carried the ground from beneath his own feet.\r\nIn helping to disband his party, he had cashiered himself; and there\r\nremained to him now, for the residue of his days, but that frailest of\r\nall sublunary treasures, a Prince's friendship.\r\n\r\nWith this conviction, (which, in spite of all the sanguineness of his\r\ndisposition, could hardly have failed to force itself on his mind,) it\r\nwas not, we should think, with very self-gratulatory feelings that he\r\nundertook the task, a few weeks after, of inditing, for the Regent, that\r\nmemorable Letter to Mr. Perceval, which sealed the fate at once both of\r\nhis party and himself, and whatever false signs of re-animation may\r\nafterwards have appeared, severed the last life-lock by which the\r\n\"struggling spirit\" [Footnote: _Lavtans anima_] of this friendship\r\nbetween Royalty and Whiggism still held:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    --\"_dextra crinem secat, omnis et una\r\n  Dilapsus calor, atque in ventos vita recessit_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to the chief Personage connected with these transactions, it\r\nis a proof of the tendency of knowledge, to produce a spirit of\r\ntolerance, that they who, judging merely from the surface of events, have\r\nbeen most forward in reprobating his separation from the Whigs, as a\r\nrupture of political ties and an abandonment of private friendships,\r\nmust, on becoming more thoroughly acquainted with all the circumstances\r\nthat led to this crisis, learn to soften down considerably their angry\r\nfeelings; and to see, indeed, in the whole history of the\r\nconnection,--from its first formation, in the hey-day of youth and party,\r\nto its faint survival after the death of Mr. Fox,--but a natural and\r\ndestined gradation towards the result at which it at last arrived, after\r\nas much fluctuation of political principle, on one side, as there was of\r\nindifference, perhaps, to all political principle on the other.\r\n\r\nAmong the arrangements that had been made, in contemplation of a new\r\nMinistry, at this time, it was intended that Lord Moira should go, as\r\nLord Lieutenant, to Ireland, and that Mr. Sheridan should accompany him,\r\nas Chief Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nAFFAIRS OF THE NEW THEATRE.--MR. WHITBREAD.--NEGOTIATIONS WITH LORD GREY\r\nAND LORD GRENVILLE.--CONDUCT OF MR. SHERIDAN RELATIVE TO THE\r\nHOUSEHOLD.--HIS LAST WORDS IN PARLIAMENT.--FAILURE AT STAFFORD.\r\n--CORRESPONDENCE WITH MR. WHITBREAD.--LORD BYRON.--DISTRESSES OF\r\nSHERIDAN.--ILLNESS.--DEATH AND FUNERAL.--GENERAL REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not till the close of this year that the Reports of the Committee\r\nappointed under the Act for rebuilding the Theatre of Drury-Lane, were\r\nlaid before the public. By these it appeared that Sheridan was to\r\nreceive, for his moiety of the property, 24,000_l_., out of which\r\nsum the claims of the Linley family and others were to be\r\nsatisfied;--that a further sum of 4000_l_. was to be paid to him for\r\nthe property of the Fruit Offices and Reversion of Boxes and Shares;--and\r\nthat his son, Mr. Thomas Sheridan, was to receive, for his quarter of the\r\nPatent Property, 12,000_l_.\r\n\r\nThe gratitude that Sheridan felt to Mr. Whitbread at first, for the\r\nkindness with which he undertook this most arduous task, did not long\r\nremain unembittered when they entered into practical details. It would be\r\ndifficult indeed to find two persons less likely to agree in a\r\ntransaction of this nature,--the one, in affairs of business, approaching\r\nalmost as near to the extreme of rigor as the other to that of laxity.\r\nWhile Sheridan, too,--like those painters, who endeavor to disguise their\r\nignorance of anatomy by an indistinct and _furzy_ outline,--had an\r\nimposing method of generalizing his accounts and statements, which, to\r\nmost eyes, concealed the negligence and fallacy of the details, Mr.\r\nWhitbread, on the contrary, with an unrelenting accuracy, laid open the\r\nminutiae of every transaction, and made evasion as impossible to others,\r\nas it was alien and inconceivable to himself. He was, perhaps, the only\r\nperson, whom Sheridan had ever found proof against his powers of\r\npersuasion,--and this rigidity naturally mortified his pride full as much\r\nas it thwarted and disconcerted his views.\r\n\r\nAmong the conditions to which he agreed, in order to facilitate the\r\narrangements of the Committee, the most painful to him was that which\r\nstipulated that he, himself, should \"have no concern or connection, of\r\nany kind whatever, with the new undertaking.\" This concession, however,\r\nhe, at first, regarded as a mere matter of form--feeling confident that,\r\neven without any effort of his own, the necessity under which the new\r\nCommittee would find themselves of recurring to his advice and\r\nassistance, would, ere long, reinstate him in all his former influence.\r\nBut in this hope he was disappointed--his exclusion from all concern in\r\nthe new Theatre, (which, it is said, was made a _sine-qua-non_ by\r\nall who embarked in it,) was inexorably enforced by Whitbread; and the\r\nfollowing letter addressed by him to the latter will show the state of\r\ntheir respective feelings on this point:--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR WHITBREAD,\r\n\r\n\"I am not going to write you a controversial or even an argumentative\r\nletter, but simply to put down the heads of a few matters which I wish\r\nshortly to converse with you upon, in the most amicable and temperate\r\nmanner, deprecating the impatience which may sometimes have mixed in our\r\ndiscussions, and not contending who has been the aggressor.\r\n\r\n\"The main point you seem to have had so much at heart you have carried,\r\nso there is an end of that; and I shall as fairly and cordially endeavor\r\nto advise and assist Mr. Benjamin Wyatt in the improving and perfecting\r\nhis plan as if it had been my own preferable selection, assuming, as I\r\nmust do, that there cannot exist an individual in England so presumptuous\r\nor so void of common sense as not sincerely to solicit the aid of my\r\npractical experience on this occasion, even were I not, in justice to the\r\nSubscribers, bound spontaneously to offer it.\r\n\r\n\"But it would be unmanly dissimulation in me to retain the sentiments I\r\ndo with respect to _your_ doctrine on this subject, and not express\r\nwhat I so strongly feel. That doctrine was, to my utter astonishment, to\r\nsay no more, first promulgated to me in a letter from you, written in\r\ntown, in the following terms. Speaking of building and plans, you say to\r\nme, '_You are in no, way answerable if a bad Theatre is built: it is\r\nnot_ YOU _who built it; and if we come to the_ STRICT RIGHT _of\r\nthe thing, you have_ NO BUSINESS TO INTERFERE;' and further on you\r\nsay, '_Will_ YOU _but_ STAND ALOOF, _and every thing will go\r\nsmooth_, and a good Theatre shall be built;' and in conversation you\r\nput, as a similar case, that, '_if a man sold another a piece of land,\r\nit was nothing to the seller whether the purchaser built himself a good\r\nor a bad house upon it._' Now I declare before God I never felt more\r\namazement than that a man of your powerful intellect, just view of all\r\nsubjects, and knowledge of the world, should hold such language or resort\r\nto such arguments; and I must be convinced, that, although in an\r\nimpatient moment this opinion may have fallen from you, upon the least\r\nreflection or the slightest attention to the reason of the case, you\r\nwould, 'albeit unused to the retracting mood,' confess the erroneous view\r\nyou had taken of the subject. Otherwise, I must think, and with the\r\ndeepest regret would it be, that although you originally engaged in this\r\nbusiness from motives of the purest and kindest regard for me and my\r\nfamily, your ardor and zealous eagerness to accomplish the difficult task\r\nyou had undertaken have led you, in this instance, to overlook what is\r\ndue to my feelings, to my honor, and my just interests. For, supposing I\r\nwere to '_stand aloof_,' totally unconcerned, provided I were paid\r\nfor my share, whether the new Theatre were excellent or execrable, and\r\nthat the result should be that the Subscribers, instead of profit, could\r\nnot, through the misconstruction of the house, obtain one per cent. for\r\ntheir money, do you seriously believe you could find a single man, woman,\r\nor child, in the kingdom, out of the Committee, who would believe that I\r\nwas wholly guiltless of the failure, having been so stultified and\r\nproscribed by the Committee, (a Committee of _my own nomination)_ as\r\nto have been compelled to admit, as the condition of my being paid for my\r\nshare, that 'it was nothing to me whether the Theatre was good or bad'\r\nor, on the contrary? can it be denied that the reproaches of\r\ndisappointment, through the great body of the Subscribers, would be\r\ndirected against me and me alone?\r\n\r\n\"So much as to _character_:--now as to my feelings on the subject;--I\r\nmust say that in friendship, at least, if not in '_strict right_,'\r\nthey ought to be consulted, even though the Committee could either prove\r\nthat I had not to apprehend any share in the discredit and discontent\r\nwhich might follow the ill success of their plan, or that I was entitled\r\nto brave whatever malice or ignorance might direct against me. Next, and\r\nlastly, as to my just interest in the property I am to part with, a\r\nconsideration to which, however careless I might be were I alone\r\nconcerned, I am bound to attend in justice to my own private creditors,\r\nobserve how the matter stands:--I agree to wave my own '_strict\r\nright_' to be paid before the funds can be applied to the building,\r\nand this in the confidence and on the continued understanding, that my\r\nadvice should be so far respected, that, even should the subscription not\r\nfill, I should at least see a Theatre capable of being charged with and\r\nultimately of discharging what should remain justly due to the\r\nproprietors. To illustrate this I refer to the size of the pit, the\r\nnumber of private boxes, and the annexation of a tavern; but in what a\r\nsituation would the doctrine of your Committee leave me and my son? 'It\r\nis nothing to us how the Theatre is built, or whether it prospers or\r\nnot.' These are two circumstances we have nothing to do with; only,\r\nunfortunately, upon them may depend our best chance of receiving any\r\npayment for the property we part with. It is nothing to us how the ship\r\nis refitted or manned, only we must leave all we are worth on board her,\r\nand abide the chance of her success. Now I am confident your justice will\r\nsee, that in order that the Committee should, in '_strict right_,'\r\nbecome entitled to deal thus with us, and bid us _stand aloof_, they\r\nshould buy us out, and make good the payment. But the reverse of this has\r\nbeen my own proposal, and I neither repent nor wish to make any change in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"I have totally departed from my intention, when I first began this\r\nletter, for which I ought to apologize to you; but it may save much\r\nfuture talk: other less important matters will do in conversation. You\r\nwill allow that I have placed in you the most implicit confidence--have\r\nthe reasonable trust in me that, in any communication I may have with B.\r\nWyatt, my object will not be to _obstruct_, as you have hastily\r\nexpressed it, but _bonâ fide_ to assist him to render his Theatre as\r\nperfect as possible, as well with a view to the public accommodation as\r\nto profit to the Subscribers; neither of which can be obtained without\r\nestablishing a reputation for him which must be the basis of his future\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\n\"And now, after all this statement, you will perhaps be surprised to find\r\nhow little I require;--simply some Resolution of the Committee to the\r\neffect of that I enclose.\r\n\r\n\"I conclude with heartily thanking you for the declaration you made\r\nrespecting me, and reported to me by Peter Moore, at the close of the\r\nlast meeting of the Committee. I am convinced of your sincerity; but as I\r\nhave before described the character of the gratitude I feel towards you\r\nin a letter written likewise in this house, I have only to say, that\r\nevery sentiment in that letter remains unabated and unalterable.\r\n\r\n\"Ever, my dear Whitbread,\r\n\r\n\"Yours, faithfully.\r\n\r\n\"P.S. The discussion we had yesterday respecting some investigation of\r\nthe _past_, which I deem so essential to my character and to my\r\npeace of mind, and your present concurrence with me on that subject, have\r\nrelieved my mind from great anxiety, though I cannot but still think the\r\nbetter opportunity has been passed by. One word more, and I release you.\r\nTom informed me that you had hinted to him that any demands, not\r\npracticable to be settled by the Committee, must fall on the proprietors.\r\nMy resolution is to take all such on myself, and to leave Tom's share\r\nuntouched.\"\r\n\r\nAnother concession, which Sheridan himself had volunteered, namely, the\r\npostponement of his right of being paid the amount of his claim, till\r\nafter the Theatre should be built, was also a subject of much acrimonious\r\ndiscussion between the two friends,--Sheridan applying to this condition\r\nthat sort of lax interpretation, which would have left him the credit of\r\nthe sacrifice without its inconvenience, and Whitbread, with a firmness\r\nof grasp, to which, unluckily, the other had been unaccustomed in\r\nbusiness, holding him to the strict letter of his voluntary agreement\r\nwith the Subscribers. Never, indeed, was there a more melancholy example\r\nthan Sheridan exhibited, at this moment, of the last, hard struggle of\r\npride and delicacy against the most deadly foe of both, pecuniary\r\ninvolvement,--which thus gathers round its victims, fold after fold, till\r\nthey are at length crushed in its inextricable clasp.\r\n\r\nThe mere likelihood of a sum of money being placed at his disposal was\r\nsufficient--like the \"bright day that brings forth the adder\"--to call\r\ninto life the activity of all his duns; and how liberally he made the\r\nfund available among them, appears from the following letter of\r\nWhitbread, addressed, not to Sheridan himself, but, apparently, (for the\r\ndirection is wanting,) to some man of business connected with him:--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I had determined not to give any written answer to the note you put into\r\nmy hands yesterday morning; but a further perusal of it leads me to think\r\nit better to make a statement in writing, why I, for one, cannot comply\r\nwith the request it contains, and to repel the impression which appears\r\nto have existed in Mr. Sheridan's mind at the time that note was written.\r\nHe insinuates that to some postponement of his interests, by the\r\nCommittee, is owing the distressed situation in which he is unfortunately\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever postponement of the interests of the Proprietors may ultimately\r\nbe resorted to, as matter of indispensable necessity from the state of\r\nthe Subscription Fund, will originate in the written suggestion of Mr.\r\nSheridan himself; and, in certain circumstances, unless such latitude\r\nwere allowed on his part, the execution of the Act could not have been\r\nattempted.\r\n\r\n\"At present there is no postponement of his interests,--but there is an\r\nutter impossibility of touching the Subscription Fund at all, except for\r\nvery trifling specified articles, until a supplementary Act of Parliament\r\nshall have been obtained.\r\n\r\n\"By the present Act, even if the Subscription were full, and no\r\nimpediments existed to the use of the money, the Act itself, and the\r\nincidental expenses of plans, surveys, &c., are first to be paid\r\nfor,--then the portion of Killegrew's Patent,--then the claimants,--and\r\n_then_ the Proprietors. Now the Act is not paid for: White and\r\nMartindale are not paid; and not one single claimant is paid, nor can any\r\none of them _be_ paid, until we have fresh powers and additional\r\nsubscriptions.\r\n\r\n\"How then can Mr. Sheridan attribute to any postponement of his\r\ninterests, actually made by the Committee, the present condition of his\r\naffairs? and why are we driven to these observations and explanations?\r\n\r\n\"We cannot but all deeply lament his distress, but the palliation he\r\nproposes it is not in our power to give.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot guarantee Mr. Hammersley upon the fund coming eventually to\r\nMr. Sheridan. He alludes to the claims he has already created upon that\r\nfund. He must, besides, recollect the list of names he sent to me some\r\ntime ago, of persons to whom he felt himself in honor bound to\r\nappropriate to each his share of that fund, in common with others for\r\nwhose names he left a blank, and who, he says in the same letter, have\r\nwritten engagements from him. Besides, he has communicated both to Mr.\r\nTaylor and to Mr. Shaw, through me, offers to impound the whole of the\r\nsum to answer the issue of the unsettled demands made upon him by those\r\ngentlemen respectively.\r\n\r\n\"How then can we guarantee Mr. Hammersley in the payment of any sum out\r\nof this fund, so circumstanced? Mr. Hammersley's possible profits are\r\nprospective, and the prospect remote. I know the positive losses he\r\nsustains, and the sacrifices he is obliged to make to procure the chance\r\nof the compromise he is willing to accept.\r\n\r\n\"Add to all this, that we are still struggling with difficulties which we\r\nmay or may not overcome; that those difficulties are greatly increased by\r\nthe persons whose interest and duty should equally lead them to give us\r\nevery facility and assistance in the labors we have disinterestedly\r\nundertaken, and are determined faithfully to discharge. If we fail at\r\nlast, from whatever cause, the whole vanishes.\r\n\r\n\"You know, my dear Sir, that I grieve for the sad state of Mr. Sheridan's\r\naffairs. I would contribute my mite to their temporary relief, if it\r\nwould be acceptable; but as one of the Committee, intrusted with a public\r\nfund, I can do nothing. I cannot be a party to any claim upon Mr.\r\nHammersley; and I utterly deny that, individually, or as part of the\r\nCommittee, any step taken by me, or with my concurrence, has pressed upon\r\nthe circumstances of Mr. Sheridan.\r\n\r\n\"I am,\r\n\r\n\"My dear Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n\"_Southill, Dec. 19, 1811.\"_\r\n\r\n\"SAMUEL WHITBREAD.\"\r\n\r\nA Dissolution of Parliament being expected to take place, Mr. Sheridan\r\nagain turned his eyes to Stafford; and, in spite of the estrangement to\r\nwhich his infidelities at Westminster had given rise, saw enough, he\r\nthought, of the \"_veteris vestigia flammae_\" to encourage him to\r\nhope for a renewal of the connection. The following letter to Sir Oswald\r\nMoseley explains his views and expectations on the subject:--\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR OSWALD,\r\n\r\n\"_Cavendish-Square, Nov. 29, 1811._\r\n\r\n\"Being apprised that you have decided to decline offering yourself a\r\ncandidate for Stafford, when a future election may arrive,--a place where\r\nyou are highly esteemed, and where every humble service in my power, as I\r\nhave before declared to you, should have been at your command,--I have\r\ndetermined to accept the very cordial invitations I have received from\r\n_old friends_ in that quarter, and, (though entirely secure of my\r\nseat at Ilchester, and, indeed, even of the second seat for my son,\r\nthrough the liberality of Sir W. Manners), to return to the old goal from\r\nwhence I started thirty-one years since! You will easily see that\r\narrangements at Ilchester may be made towards assisting me, in point of\r\nexpense, to meet _any opposition_, and, _in that respect,_\r\nnothing will be _wanting._ It will, I confess, be very gratifying to\r\nme to be again elected _by the sons of those_ who chose me in the\r\nyear _eighty_, and adhered to me so stoutly and so long. I think I\r\nwas returned for Stafford seven, if not eight, times, including two most\r\ntough and expensive contests; and, in taking a temporary leave of them I\r\nam sure my credit must stand well, for not a shilling did I leave unpaid.\r\nI have written to the Jerninghams, who, in the handsomest manner, have\r\never given me their warmest support; and, as no political object\r\ninterests my mind so much as the Catholic cause, I have no doubt that\r\nindependent of their personal friendship, I shall receive a continuation\r\nof their honorable support. I feel it to be no presumption to add, that\r\nother respectable interests in the neighborhood will be with me.\r\n\r\n\"I need scarcely add my sanguine hope, that whatever interest rests with\r\nyou, (which ought to be much), will also be in my favor.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to be,\r\n\r\n\"With great esteem and regard,\r\n\r\n\"Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean to be in Stafford, from Lord G. Levison's, in about a fortnight.\"\r\n\r\nAmong a number of notes addressed to his former constituents at this\r\ntime, (which I find written in his neatest hand, as if _intended_ to\r\nbe sent), is this curious one:--\r\n\r\n\"DEAR KING JOHN,\r\n\r\n\"_Cavendish-Square, Sunday night_,\r\n\r\n\"I shall be in Stafford in the course of next week, and if Your Majesty\r\ndoes not renew our old alliance I shall never again have faith in any\r\npotentate on earth.\r\n\r\n\"Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n\"_Mr. John K_.\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\nThe two attempts that were made in the course of the year 1812--the one,\r\non the cessation of the Regency Restrictions, and the other after the\r\nassassination of Mr. Perceval,--to bring the Whigs into official\r\nrelations with the Court, were, it is evident, but little inspired on\r\neither side, with the feelings likely to lead to such a result. It\r\nrequires but a perusal of the published correspondence in both cases to\r\nconvince us that, at the bottom of all these evolutions of negotiation,\r\nthere was anything but a sincere wish that the object to which they\r\nrelated should be accomplished. The Maréchal Bassompiere was not more\r\nafraid of succeeding in his warfare, when he said, _\"Je crois que nous\r\nserons assez fous pour prendre la Rochelle_,\" than was one of the\r\nparties, at least, in these negotiations, of any favorable turn that\r\nmight inflict success upon its overtures. Even where the Court, as in the\r\ncontested point of the Household, professed its readiness to accede to\r\nthe surrender so injudiciously demanded of it, those who acted as its\r\ndiscretionary organs knew too well the real wishes in that quarter, and\r\nhad been too long and faithfully zealous in their devotion to those\r\nwishes to leave any fear that advantage would be taken of the concession.\r\nBut, however high and chivalrous was the feeling with which Lord Moira,\r\non this occasion, threw himself into the breach for his Royal Master, the\r\nservice of Sheridan, though flowing partly from the same zeal, was not, I\r\ngrieve to say, of the same clear and honorable character.\r\n\r\nLord Yarmouth, it is well known, stated in the House of Commons that he\r\nhad communicated to Mr. Sheridan the intention of the Household to\r\nresign, with the view of having that intention conveyed to Lord Grey and\r\nLord Grenville, and thus removing the sole ground upon which these Noble\r\nLords objected to the acceptance of office. Not only, however, did\r\nSheridan endeavor to dissuade the Noble Vice-Chamberlain from resigning,\r\nbut with an unfairness of dealing which admits, I own, of no vindication,\r\nhe withheld from the two leaders of Opposition the intelligence thus\r\nmeant to be conveyed to them; and, when questioned by Mr. Tierney as to\r\nthe rumored intentions of the Household to resign, offered to bet five\r\nhundred guineas that there was no such step in contemplation.\r\n\r\nIn this conduct, which he made but a feeble attempt to explain, and which\r\nI consider as the only indefensible part of his whole public life, he\r\nwas, in some degree, no doubt, influenced by personal feelings against\r\nthe two Noble Lords, whom his want of fairness on the occasion was so\r\nwell calculated to thwart and embarrass. But the main motive of the whole\r\nproceeding is to be found in his devoted deference to what he knew to be\r\nthe wishes and feelings of that Personage, who had become now, more than\r\never, the mainspring of all his movements,--whose spell over him, in this\r\ninstance, was too strong for even his sense of character; and to whom he\r\nmight well have applied the words of one of his own beautiful songs--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Friends, fortune, _fame itself_ I'd lose,\r\n  To gain one smile from thee!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSo fatal, too often, are Royal friendships, whose attraction, like the\r\nloadstone-rock in Eastern fable, that drew the nails out of the luckless\r\nship that came near it, steals gradually away the strength by which\r\ncharacter is held together, till, at last, it loosens at all points, and\r\nfalls to pieces, a wreck!\r\n\r\nIn proof of the fettering influence under which he acted on this\r\noccasion, we find him in one of his evasive attempts at vindication,\r\nsuppressing, from delicacy to his Royal Master, a circumstance which, if\r\nmentioned, would have redounded considerably to his own credit. After\r\nmentioning that the Regent had \"asked his opinion with respect to the\r\nnegotiations that were going on,\" he adds, \"I gave him my opinion, and I\r\nmost devoutly wish that that opinion could be published to the world,\r\nthat it might serve to shame those who now belie me.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is the fact to which these expressions allude. When the\r\nPrince-Regent, on the death of Mr. Perceval, entrusted to Lord Wellesley\r\nthe task of forming an Administration, it appears that His Royal Highness\r\nhad signified either his intention or wish to exclude a certain Noble\r\nEarl from the arrangements to be made under that commission. On learning\r\nthis, Sheridan not only expressed strongly his opinion against such a\r\nstep, but having, afterwards, reason to fear that the freedom with which\r\nhe spoke on the subject had been displeasing to the Regent, he addressed\r\na letter to that Illustrious Person, (a copy of which I have in my\r\npossession,) in which, after praising the \"wisdom and magnanimity\"\r\ndisplayed by His Royal Highness, in confiding to Lord Wellesley the\r\npowers that had just been entrusted to him, he repeated his opinion that\r\nany \"proscription\" of the Noble Earl in question, would be \"a proceeding\r\nequally derogatory to the estimation of His Royal Highness's personal\r\ndignity and the security of his political power;\"--adding, that the\r\nadvice, which he took the liberty of giving against such a step, did not\r\nproceed \"from any peculiar partiality to the Noble Earl or to many of\r\nthose with whom he was allied; but was founded on what he considered to\r\nbe best for His Royal Highness's honor and interest, and for the general\r\ninterests of the country.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter (in alluding to the displeasure which he feared he had\r\nincurred by venturing this opinion) concludes thus:--\r\n\r\n\"Junius said in a public letter of his, addressed to Your Royal Father,\r\n'the fate that made you a King forbad your having a friend.' I deny his\r\nproposition as a general maxim--I am confident that Your Royal Highness\r\npossesses qualities to win and secure to you the attachment and devotion\r\nof private friendship, in spite of your being a Sovereign. At least I\r\nfeel that I am entitled to make this declaration as far as relates to\r\nmyself--and I do it under the assured conviction that you will never\r\nrequire from me any proof of that attachment and devotion inconsistent\r\nwith the clear and honorable independence of mind and conduct, which\r\nconstitute my sole value as a public man, and which have hitherto been my\r\nbest recommendation to your gracious favor, confidence, and protection.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that while by this wise advice he helped to save\r\nHis Royal Master from the invidious _appearance_ of acting upon a\r\nprinciple of exclusion, he should, by his private management afterwards,\r\nhave but too well contrived to secure to him all the advantage of that\r\nprinciple in _reality_.\r\n\r\nThe political career of Sheridan was now drawing fast to a close. He\r\nspoke but upon two or three other occasions during the Session; and among\r\nthe last sentences uttered by him in the House were the\r\nfollowing;--which, as calculated to leave a sweeter flavor on the memory,\r\nat parting, than those questionable transactions that have just been\r\nrelated, I have great pleasure in citing:--\r\n\r\n\"My objection to the present Ministry, is that they are avowedly arrayed\r\nand embodied against a principle,--that of concession to the Catholics of\r\nIreland,--which I think, and must always think, essential to the safety\r\nof this empire. I will never give my vote to any Administration that\r\nopposes the question of Catholic Emancipation. I will not consent to\r\nreceive a furlough upon that particular question, even though a Ministry\r\nwere carrying every other that I wished. In fine, I think the situation\r\nof Ireland a paramount consideration. If they were to be the last words I\r\nshould ever utter in this House, I should say, 'Be just to Ireland, as\r\nyou value your own honor,--be just to Ireland, as you value your own\r\npeace.'\"\r\n\r\nHis very last words in Parliament, on his own motion relative to the\r\nOvertures of Peace from France, were as follow:--\r\n\r\n\"Yet after the general subjugation and ruin of Europe, should there ever\r\nexist an independent historian to record the awful events that produced\r\nthis universal calamity, let that historian have to say,--'Great Britain\r\nfell, and with her fell all the best securities for the charities of\r\nhuman life, for the power and honor, the fame, the glory, and the\r\nliberties, not only of herself, but of the whole civilized world.'\" In\r\nthe month of September following, Parliament was dissolved; and,\r\npresuming upon the encouragement which he had received from some of his\r\nStafford friends, he again tried his chance of election for that borough,\r\nbut without success. This failure he, himself, imputed, as will be seen\r\nby the following letter, to the refusal of Mr. Whitbread to advance him\r\n2000_l._ out of the sum due to him by the Committee for his share of\r\nthe property:--\r\n\r\n\"DEAR WHITBREAD,\r\n\r\n\"_Cook's Hotel, Nov._ 1, 1812.\r\n\r\n\"I was misled to expect you in town the beginning of last week, but being\r\npositively assured that you will arrive to-morrow, I have declined\r\naccompanying Hester into Hampshire as I intended, and she has gone to-day\r\nwithout me; but I must leave town to join her _as soon as I can_. We\r\nmust have some serious but yet, I hope, friendly conversation respecting\r\nmy unsettled claims on the Drury-Lane Theatre Corporation. A concluding\r\nparagraph, in one of your last letters to Burgess, which he thought\r\nhimself justified in showing me, leads me to believe that it is not your\r\nobject to distress or destroy me. On the subject of your refusing to\r\nadvance to me the 2000_l._. I applied for to take with me to\r\nStafford, out of the large sum confessedly due to me, (unless I signed\r\nsome paper containing I know not what, and which you presented to my\r\nbreast like a cocked pistol on the last day I saw you,) I will not dwell.\r\n_This, and this alone, lost me my election._ You deceive yourself if\r\nyou give credit to any other causes, which the pride of my friends chose\r\nto attribute our failure to, rather than confess our poverty. I do not\r\nmean now to expostulate with you, much less to reproach you, but sure I\r\nam that when you contemplate the positive injustice of refusing me the\r\naccommodation I required, and the irreparable injury that refusal has\r\ncast on me, overturning, probably, all the honor and independence of what\r\nremains of my political life, you will deeply reproach yourself.\r\n\r\n\"I shall make an application to the Committee, when I hear you have\r\nappointed one, for the assistance which most pressing circumstances now\r\ncompel me to call for; and all I desire is, through a sincere wish that\r\nour friendship may not be interrupted, that the answer to that\r\napplication may proceed from a _bonâ fide Committee, with their\r\nsignatures_, testifying their decision.\r\n\r\n\"I am, yet,\r\n\r\n\"Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n\"_S. Whitbread, Esq._\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the angry feeling which is expressed in this letter, and\r\nwhich the state of poor Sheridan's mind, goaded as he was now by distress\r\nand disappointment, may well excuse, it will be seen by the following\r\nletter from Whitbread, written on the very eve of the elections in\r\nSeptember, that there was no want of inclination, on the part of this\r\nhonorable and excellent man, to afford assistance to his friend,--but\r\nthat the duties of the perplexing trust which he had undertaken rendered\r\nsuch irregular advances as Sheridan required impossible:--\r\n\r\n'MY DEAR SHERIDAN,\r\n\r\n\"We will not enter into details, although you are quite mistaken in them.\r\nYou know how happy I shall be to propose to the Committee to agree to\r\nanything practicable; and you may make all practicable, if you will have\r\nresolution to look at the state of the account between you and the\r\nCommittee, and agree to the mode of its liquidation.\r\n\r\n\"You will recollect the 5000_l_. pledged to Peter Moore to answer\r\ndemands; the certificates given to Giblet, Ker, Ironmonger, Cross, and\r\nHirdle, five each at your request; the engagements given to Ellis and\r\nmyself, and the arrears to the Linley family. All this taken into\r\nconsideration will leave a large balance still payable to you. Still\r\nthere are upon that balance the claims upon you by Shaw, Taylor, and\r\nGrubb, for all of which you have offered to leave the whole of your\r\ncompensation in my hands, to abide the issue of arbitration.\r\n\r\n\"This may be managed by your agreeing to take a considerable portion of\r\nyour balance in bonds, leaving those bonds in trust to answer the events.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be in town on Monday to the Committee, and will be prepared with\r\na sketch of the state of your account with the Committee, and with the\r\nmode in which I think it would be prudent for you and them to adjust it;\r\nwhich if you will agree to, and direct the conveyance to be made\r\nforthwith, I will undertake to propose the advance of money you wish. But\r\nwithout a clear arrangement, as a justification, nothing can be done.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be in Dover-Street at nine o'clock, and be there and in\r\nDrury-Lane all day. The Queen comes, but the day is not fixed. The\r\nelection will occupy me after Monday. After that is over, I hope we shall\r\nsee you.\r\n\r\n\"Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n\"_Southill, Sept. 25, 1812._\r\n\r\n\"S. WHITBREAD.\"\r\n\r\nThe feeling entertained by Sheridan towards the Committee had already\r\nbeen strongly manifested this year by the manner in which Mrs. Sheridan\r\nreceived the Resolution passed by them, offering her the use of a box in\r\nthe new Theatre. The notes of Whitbread to Mrs. Sheridan on this subject,\r\nprove how anxious he was to conciliate the wounded feelings of his\r\nfriend:--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR ESTHER,\r\n\r\n\"I have delayed sending the enclosed Resolution of the Drury-Lane\r\nCommittee to you, because I had hoped to have found a moment to have\r\ncalled upon you, and to have delivered it into your hands. But I see no\r\nchance of that, and therefore literally obey my instructions in writing\r\nto you.\r\n\r\n\"I had great pleasure in proposing the Resolution, which was cordially\r\nand unanimously adopted. I had it always in contemplation,--but to have\r\nproposed it earlier would have been improper. I hope you will derive much\r\namusement from your visits to the Theatre, and that you and all of your\r\nname will ultimately be pleased with what has been done. I have just had\r\na most satisfactory letter from Tom Sheridan.\r\n\r\n\"I am,\r\n\r\n\"My dear Esther,\r\n\r\n\"Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n\"_Dover-Street, July 4, 1812._\r\n\r\n\"SAMUEL WHITBREAD.\"\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR ESTHER,\r\n\r\n\"It has been a great mortification and disappointment to me, to have met\r\nthe Committee twice, since the offer of the use of a box at the new\r\nTheatre was made to you, and that I have not had to report the slightest\r\nacknowledgment from you in return.\r\n\r\n\"The Committee meet again tomorrow, and after that there will be no\r\nmeeting for some time. If I shall be compelled to return the same blank\r\nanswer I have hitherto done, the inference drawn will naturally be, that\r\nwhat was designed by himself, who moved it, and by those who voted it, as\r\na gratifying mark of attention to Sheridan through you, (as the most\r\ngratifying mode of conveying it,) has, for some unaccountable reason,\r\nbeen mistaken and is declined.\r\n\r\n\"But I shall be glad to know before to-morrow, what is your determination\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\n\"I am, dear Esther,\r\n\r\n\"Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n\"_Dover-Street, July_ 12, 1812.\"\r\n\r\n\"S. WHITBREAD.\r\n\r\nThe failure of Sheridan at Stafford completed his ruin. He was now\r\nexcluded both from the Theatre and from Parliament:--the two anchors by\r\nwhich he held in life were gone, and he was left a lonely and helpless\r\nwreck upon the waters. The Prince Regent offered to bring him into\r\nParliament; but the thought of returning to that scene of his triumphs\r\nand his freedom, with the Royal owner's mark, as it were, upon him, was\r\nmore than he could bear--and he declined the offer. Indeed, miserable and\r\ninsecure as his life was now, when we consider the public humiliations to\r\nwhich he would have been exposed, between his ancient pledge to Whiggism\r\nand his attachment and gratitude to Royalty, it is not wonderful that he\r\nshould have preferred even the alternative of arrests and imprisonments\r\nto the risk of bringing upon his political name any further tarnish in\r\nsuch a struggle. Neither could his talents have much longer continued to\r\ndo themselves justice, amid the pressure of such cares, and the increased\r\nindulgence of habits, which, as is usual, gained upon him, as all other\r\nindulgences vanished. The ancients, we are told, by a significant device,\r\ninscribed on the wreaths they wore at banquets the name of Minerva.\r\nUnfortunately, from the festal wreath of Sheridan this name was now but\r\ntoo often effaced; and the same charm, that once had served to give a\r\nquicker flow to thought, was now employed to muddy the stream, as it\r\nbecame painful to contemplate what was at the bottom of it. By his\r\nexclusion, therefore, from Parliament, he was, perhaps, seasonably saved\r\nfrom affording to that \"Folly, which loves the martyrdom of Fame,\"\r\n[Footnote: \"And Folly loves the martyrdom of Fame.\"\r\n\r\nThis fine line is in Lord Byron's Monody to his memory. There is another\r\nline, equally true and touching, where, alluding to the irregularities of\r\nthe latter part of Sheridan's life, he says--\r\n\r\n\"And what to them seem'd vice might be but woe.\"] the spectacle of a\r\ngreat mind, not only surviving itself, but, like the champion in Berni,\r\ncontinuing the combat after life is gone:--\r\n\r\n_\"Andava combattendo, ed era morto.\"_\r\n\r\nIn private society, however, he could, even now, (before the Rubicon of\r\nthe cup was passed,) fully justify his high reputation for agreeableness\r\nand wit; and a day which it was my good fortune to spend with him, at the\r\ntable of Mr. Rogers, has too many mournful, as well as pleasant,\r\nassociations connected with it, to be easily forgotten by the survivors\r\nof the party. The company consisted but of Mr. Rogers himself, Lord\r\nByron, Mr. Sheridan, and the writer of this Memoir. Sheridan knew the\r\nadmiration his audience felt for him; the presence of the young poet, in\r\nparticular, seemed to bring back his own youth and wit; and the details\r\nhe gave of his early life were not less interesting and animating to\r\nhimself than delightful to us. It was in the course of this evening that,\r\ndescribing to us the poem which Mr. Whitbread had written and sent in,\r\namong the other Addresses, for the opening of Drury-Lane, and which, like\r\nthe rest, turned chiefly on allusions to the Phenix, he said,--\"But\r\nWhitbread made more of this bird than any of them:--he entered into\r\nparticulars, and described its wings, beak, tail, &c.; in short, it was a\r\n_Poulterer's_ description of a Phenix!\"\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a Diary in my possession, kept by Lord Byron\r\nduring six months of his residence in London, 1812-13, will show the\r\nadmiration which this great and generous spirit felt for Sheridan:--\r\n\r\n\"_Saturday, December 18, 1813._\r\n\r\n\"Lord Holland told me a curious piece of _sentimentality_ in\r\nSheridan. The other night we were all delivering our respective and\r\nvarious opinions on him and other '_hommes marquans,_' and mine was\r\nthis:--'Whatever Sheridan has done or chosen to do has been _par\r\nexcellence_, always the _best_ of its kind. He has written the\r\n_best_ comedy, (School for Scandal,) the _best_ opera, (The\r\nDuenna--in my mind far before that St. Giles's lampoon, The Beggar's\r\nOpera,) the _best_ farce, (The Critic--it is only too good for an\r\nafter-piece,) and the _best_ Address, (Monologue on Garrick,)--and\r\nto crown all, delivered the very _best_ oration, (the famous Begum\r\nSpeech,) ever conceived or heard in this country.' Somebody told Sheridan\r\nthis the next day, and on hearing it, he burst into tears!--Poor\r\nBrinsley! If they were tears of pleasure, I would rather have said those\r\nfew, but sincere, words, than have written the Iliad, or made his own\r\ncelebrated Philippic. Nay, his own comedy never gratified me more than to\r\nhear that he had derived a moment's gratification from any praise of mine\r\n--humble as it must appear to 'my elders and my betters.'\"\r\n\r\nThe distresses of Sheridan now increased every day, and through the short\r\nremainder of his life it is a melancholy task to follow him. The sum\r\narising from the sale of his theatrical property was soon exhausted by\r\nthe various claims upon it, and he was driven to part with all that he\r\nmost valued, to satisfy further demands and provide for the subsistence\r\nof the day. Those books which, as I have already mentioned, were\r\npresented to him by various friends, now stood in their splendid\r\nbindings, [Footnote: In most of them, too, were the names of the givers.\r\nThe delicacy with which Mr. Harrison of Wardour-Street, (the pawnbroker\r\nwith whom the books and the cup were deposited,) behaved, after the death\r\nof Mr. Sheridan, deserves to be mentioned with praise. Instead of\r\navailing himself of the public feeling at that moment, by submitting\r\nthese precious relics to the competition of a sale, he privately\r\ncommunicated to the family and one or two friends of Sheridan the\r\ncircumstance of his having such articles in his hands, and demanded\r\nnothing more than the sum regularly due on them. The Stafford cup is in\r\nthe possession of Mr. Charles Sheridan.] on the shelves of the\r\npawnbroker. The handsome cup, given him by the electors of Stafford,\r\nshared the same fate. Three or four fine pictures by Gainsborough, and\r\none by Morland, were sold for little more than five hundred pounds;\r\n[Footnote: In the following extract from a note to his solicitor, he\r\nrefers to these pictures:\r\n\r\n\"DEAR BURGESS,\r\n\r\n\"I am perfectly satisfied with your account;--nothing can be more clear\r\nor fair, or more disinterested on your part;--but I must grieve to think\r\nthat five or six hundred pounds for my poor pictures are added to the\r\nexpenditure. However, we shall come through!\"] and even the precious\r\nportrait of his first wife, [Footnote: As Saint Cecilia. The portrait of\r\nMrs. Sheridan at Knowle, though less ideal than that of Sir Joshua, is,\r\n(for this very reason, perhaps, as bearing a closer resemblance to the\r\noriginal,) still more beautiful.] by Reynolds, though not actually sold\r\nduring his life, vanished away from his eyes into other hands.\r\n\r\nOne of the most humiliating trials of his pride was yet to come. In the\r\nspring of this year he was arrested and carried to a spunging-house,\r\nwhere he remained two or three days. This abode, from which the following\r\npainful letter to Whitbread was written, formed a sad contrast to those\r\nPrincely halls, of which he had so lately been the most brilliant and\r\nfavored guest, and which were possibly, at that very moment, lighted up\r\nand crowded with gay company, unmindful of him within those prison\r\nwalls:--\r\n\r\n\"_Tooke's Court, Cursitor-Street, Thursday, past two._\r\n\r\n\"I have done everything in my power with the solicitors, White and\r\nFounes, to obtain my release, by substituting a better security for them\r\nthan their detaining me--but in vain.\r\n\r\n\"Whitbread, putting all false professions of friendship and feeling out\r\nof the question, you have no right to keep me here!--for it is in truth\r\n_your_ act--if you had not forcibly withheld from me the _twelve\r\nthousand pounds_, in consequence of a threatening letter from a\r\nmiserable swindler, whose claim YOU in particular knew to _be a\r\nlie_, I should at least have been out of the reach of _this_\r\nstate of miserable insult--for that, and that only, lost me my seat in\r\nParliament. And I assert that you cannot find a lawyer in the land, that\r\nis not either a natural-born fool or a corrupted scoundrel, who will not\r\ndeclare that your conduct in this respect was neither warrantable nor\r\nlegal--but let that pass _for the present_.\r\n\r\n\"Independently of the 1000_l_. ignorantly withheld from me on the\r\nday of considering my last claim.

My word ought to be taken on this subject; and you may\r\nproduce to them this document, if one, among them could think that, under\r\nall the circumstances, your conduct required a justification. O God! with\r\nwhat mad confidence have I trusted _your word_,--I ask\r\n_justice_ from you, and _no boon_. I enclosed you yesterday\r\nthree different securities, which had you been disposed to have acted\r\neven as a private friend, would have made it _certain_ that you\r\nmight have done so _without the smallest risk_. These you discreetly\r\noffered to put into the fire, when you found the object of your humane\r\nvisit satisfied by seeing me safe in prison.\r\n\r\n\"I shall only add, that, I think, if I know myself, had our lots been\r\nreversed, and I had seen you in my situation, and had left Lady E. in\r\nthat of my wife, I would have risked 600_l_. rather than have left\r\nyou so--although I had been in no way accessory in bringing you into that\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\"_S. Whitbread. Esq._\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\"\r\n\r\nEven in this situation the sanguineness of his disposition did not desert\r\nhim; for he was found by Mr. Whitbread, on his visit to the\r\nspunging-house, confidently calculating on the representation for\r\nWestminster, in which the proceedings relative to Lord Cochrane at that\r\nmoment promised a vacancy. On his return home, however, to Mrs. Sheridan,\r\n(some arrangements having been made by Whitbread for his release,) all\r\nhis fortitude forsook him, and he burst into a long and passionate fit of\r\nweeping at the profanation, as he termed it, which his person had\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nHe had for some months had a feeling that his life was near its close;\r\nand I find the following touching passage in a letter from him to Mrs.\r\nSheridan, after one of those differences which will sometimes occur\r\nbetween the most affectionate companions, and which, possibly, a\r\nremonstrance on his irregularities and want of care of himself\r\noccasioned:--\"Never again let one harsh word pass between us, during the\r\nperiod, which may not perhaps be long, that we are in this world\r\ntogether, and life, however clouded to me, is mutually spared to us. I\r\nhave expressed this same sentiment to my son, in a letter I wrote to him\r\na few days since, and I had his answer--a most affecting one, and, I am\r\nsure, very sincere--and have since cordially embraced him. Don't imagine\r\nthat I am expressing an interesting apprehension about myself, which I do\r\nnot feel.\"\r\n\r\nThough the new Theatre of Drury-Lane had now been three years built, his\r\nfeelings had never allowed him to set his foot within its walls. About\r\nthis time, however, he was persuaded by his friend, Lord Essex, to dine\r\nwith him and go in the evening to His Lordship's box, to see Kean. Once\r\nthere, the \"_genius loci_\" seems to have regained its influence over\r\nhim; for, on missing him from the box, between the Acts, Lord Essex, who\r\nfeared that he had left the House, hastened out to inquire, and, to his\r\ngreat satisfaction, found him installed in the Green-room, with all the\r\nactors around him, welcoming him back to the old region of his glory,\r\nwith a sort of filial cordiality. Wine was immediately ordered, and a\r\nbumper to the health of Mr. Sheridan was drank by all present, with the\r\nexpression of many a hearty wish that he would often, very often,\r\nre-appear among them. This scene, as was natural, exhilarated his\r\nspirits, and, on parting with Lord Essex that night, at his own door, in\r\nSaville-Row, he said triumphantly that the world would soon hear of him,\r\nfor the Duke of Norfolk was about to bring him into Parliament. This, it\r\nappears, was actually the case; but Death stood near as he spoke. In a\r\nfew days after his last fatal illness began.\r\n\r\nAmid all the distresses of these latter years of his life, he appears but\r\nrarely to have had recourse to pecuniary assistance from friends. Mr.\r\nPeter Moore, Mr. Ironmonger, and one or two others, who did more for the\r\ncomfort of his decline than any of his high and noble associates, concur\r\nin stating that, except for such an occasional trifle as his coach-hire,\r\nhe was by no means, as has been sometimes asserted, in the habit of\r\nborrowing. One instance, however, where he laid himself under this sort\r\nof obligation, deserves to be mentioned. Soon after the return of Mr.\r\nCanning from Lisbon, a letter was put into his hands, in the House of\r\nCommons, which proved to be a request from his old friend Sheridan, then\r\nlying ill in bed, that he would oblige him with the loan of a hundred\r\npounds. It is unnecessary to say that the request was promptly and\r\nfeelingly complied with; and if the pupil has ever regretted leaving the\r\npolitics of his master, it was not at _that_ moment, at least, such\r\na feeling was likely to present itself.\r\n\r\nThere are, in the possession of a friend of Sheridan, copies of a\r\ncorrespondence in which he was engaged this year with two noble Lords and\r\nthe confidential agent of an illustrious Personage, upon a subject, as it\r\nappears, of the utmost delicacy and importance. The letters of Sheridan,\r\nit is said, (for I have not seen them,) though of too secret and\r\nconfidential a nature to meet the public eye, not only prove the great\r\nconfidence reposed in him by the parties concerned, but show the\r\nclearness and manliness of mind which he could still command, under the\r\npressure of all that was most trying to human intellect.\r\n\r\nThe disorder, with which he was now attacked, arose from a diseased state\r\nof the stomach, brought on partly by irregular living, and partly by the\r\nharassing anxieties that had, for so many years, without intermission,\r\nbeset him. His powers of digestion grew every day worse, till he was at\r\nlength unable to retain any sustenance. Notwithstanding this, however,\r\nhis strength seemed to be but little broken, and his pulse remained, for\r\nsome time, strong and regular. Had he taken, indeed, but ordinary care of\r\nhimself through life, the robust conformation of his frame, and\r\nparticularly, as I have heard his physician remark, the peculiar width\r\nand capaciousness of his chest, seemed to mark him out for a long course\r\nof healthy existence. In general Nature appears to have a prodigal\r\ndelight in enclosing her costliest essences in the most frail and\r\nperishable vessels:--but Sheridan was a signal exception to this remark;\r\nfor, with a spirit so \"finely touched,\" he combined all the robustness of\r\nthe most uninspired clay.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sheridan was, at first, not aware of his danger; but Dr. Bain--whose\r\nskill was now, as it ever had been, disinterestedly at the service of his\r\nfriend, [Footnote: A letter from Sheridan to this amiable man, (of which\r\nI know not the date,) written in reference to a caution which he had\r\ngiven Mrs. Sheridan, against sleeping in the same bed with a lady who was\r\nconsumptive, expresses feelings creditable alike to the writer and his\r\nphysician:--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"_July 31._\r\n\r\n\"The caution you recommend proceeds from that attentive kindness which\r\nHester always receives from you, and upon which I place the greatest\r\nreliance for her safety. I so entirely agree with your apprehensions on\r\nthe subject, that I think it was very giddy in me not to have been struck\r\nwith them when she first mentioned having slept with her friend. Nothing\r\ncan abate my love for her; and the manner in which you apply the interest\r\nyou take in her happiness, and direct the influence you possess in her\r\nmind, render you, beyond comparison, the person I feel most obliged to\r\nupon earth. I take this opportunity of saying this upon paper, because it\r\nis a subject on which I always find it difficult to speak.\r\n\r\n\"With respect to that part of your note in which you express such\r\nfriendly partiality, as to my parliamentary conduct, I need not add that\r\nthere is no man whose good opinion can be more flattering to me.\r\n\r\n\"I am ever, my dear Bain,\r\n\r\n\"Your sincere and obliged\r\n\r\n\"R. B. SHERIDAN.\"]--thought it right to communicate to her the\r\napprehensions that he felt. From that moment, her attentions to the\r\nsufferer never ceased day or night; and, though drooping herself with an\r\nillness that did not leave her long behind him, she watched over his\r\nevery word and wish, with unremitting anxiety, to the last.\r\n\r\nConnected, no doubt, with the disorganization of his stomach, was an\r\nabscess, from which, though distressingly situated, he does not appear to\r\nhave suffered much pain. In the spring of this year, however, he was\r\nobliged to confine himself, almost entirely, to his bed. Being expected\r\nto attend the St. Patrick's Dinner, on the 17th of March, he wrote a\r\nletter to the Duke of Kent, who was President, alleging severe\r\nindisposition as the cause of his absence. The contents of this letter\r\nwere communicated to the company, and produced, as appears by the\r\nfollowing note from the Duke of Kent, a strong sensation:--\r\n\r\n_Kensington Palace, March_ 27, 1816.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SHERIDAN,\r\n\r\n\"I have been so hurried ever since St. Patrick's day, as to be unable\r\nearlier to thank you for your kind letter, which I received while\r\npresiding at the festive board; but I can assure you, I was not unmindful\r\nof it _then_, but announced the afflicting cause of your absence to\r\nthe company, who expressed, in a manner that could not be\r\n_misunderstood_, their continued affection for the writer of it. It\r\nnow only remains for me to assure you, that I appreciate as I ought the\r\nsentiments of attachment it contains for me, and which will ever be most\r\ncordially returned by him, who is with the most friendly regard, my dear\r\nSheridan,\r\n\r\n\"Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\"_The Right Hon. R. B. Sheridan_.\r\n\r\n\"EDWARD.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter to him at this time from his elder sister will be\r\nread with interest:--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n\"_Dublin, May 9, 1816._\r\n\r\n\"I am very, very sorry you are ill; but I trust in God your naturally\r\nstrong constitution will retrieve all, and that I shall soon have the\r\nsatisfaction of hearing that you are in a fair way of recovery. I well\r\nknow the nature of your complaint, that it is extremely painful, but if\r\nproperly treated, and no doubt you have the best advice, not dangerous. I\r\nknow a lady now past seventy four, who many years since was attacked with\r\na similar complaint, and is now as well as most persons of her time of\r\nlife. Where poulticing is necessary, I have known oatmeal used with the\r\nbest effect. Forgive, dear brother, this officious zeal. Your son Thomas\r\ntold me he felt obliged to me for not prescribing for him. I did not,\r\nbecause in his case I thought it would be ineffectual; in yours I have\r\nreason to hope the contrary. I am very glad to hear of the good effect\r\nchange of climate has made in him;--I took a great liking to him; there\r\nwas something kind in his manner that won upon my affections. Of your son\r\nCharles I hear the most delightful accounts:--that he has an excellent\r\nand cultivated understanding, and a heart as good. May he be a blessing\r\nto you, and a compensation for much you have endured! That I do not know\r\nhim, that I have not seen you, (so early and so long the object of my\r\naffection,) for so many years, has not been my fault; but I have ever\r\nconsidered it as a drawback upon a situation not otherwise unfortunate;\r\nfor, to use the words of Goldsmith, I have endeavored to 'draw upon\r\ncontent for the deficiencies of fortune;' and truly I have had some\r\nemployment in that way, for considerable have been our worldly\r\ndisappointments. But those are not the worst evils of life, and we have\r\ngood children, which is its first blessing. I have often told you my son\r\nTom bore a strong resemblance to you, when I loved you preferably to any\r\nthing the world contained. This, which was the case with him in childhood\r\nand early youth, is still so in mature years. In character of mind, too,\r\nhe is very like you, though education and situation have made a great\r\ndifference. At that period of existence, when the temper, morals, and\r\npropensities are formed, Tom had a mother who watched over his health,\r\nhis well-being, and every part of education in which a female could be\r\nuseful. _You_ had lost a mother who would have cherished you, whose\r\ntalents you inherited, who would have softened the asperity of our\r\nfather's temper, and probably have prevented his unaccountable\r\npartialities. You have always shown a noble independence of spirit, that\r\nthe pecuniary difficulties you often had to encounter could not induce\r\nyou to forego. As a public man, you have been, like the motto of the\r\nLefanu family, '_Sine macula_,' and I am persuaded had you not too\r\nearly been thrown upon the world, and alienated from your family, you\r\nwould have been equally good as a private character. My son is eminently\r\nso. * * *\r\n\r\n\"Do, dear brother, send me one line to tell me you are better, and\r\nbelieve me, most affectionately,\r\n\r\n\"Yours,\r\n\r\n\"ALICIA LEEANU.\"\r\n\r\nWhile death was thus gaining fast on Sheridan, the miseries of his life\r\nwere thickening around him also; nor did the last corner, in which he now\r\nlay down to die, afford him any asylum from the clamors of his legal\r\npursuers. Writs and executions came in rapid succession, and bailiffs at\r\nlength gained possession of his house. It was about the beginning of May\r\nthat Lord Holland, on being informed by Mr. Rogers, (who was one of the\r\nvery few that watched the going out of this great light with interest,)\r\nof the dreary situation in which his old friend was lying, paid him a\r\nvisit one evening, in company with Mr. Rogers, and by the cordiality,\r\nsuavity, and cheerfulness of his conversation, shed a charm round that\r\nchamber of sickness, which, perhaps, no other voice but his own could\r\nhave imparted.\r\n\r\nSheridan was, I believe, sincerely attached to Lord Holland, in whom he\r\nsaw transmitted the same fine qualities, both of mind and heart, which,\r\nnotwithstanding occasional appearances to the contrary, he had never\r\nceased to love and admire in his great relative;--the same ardor for\r\nRight and impatience of Wrong--the same mixture of wisdom and simplicity,\r\nso tempering each other, as to make the simplicity refined and the wisdom\r\nunaffected--the same gentle magnanimity of spirit, intolerant only of\r\ntyranny and injustice--and, in addition to all this, a range and vivacity\r\nof conversation, entirely his own, which leaves no subject untouched or\r\nunadorned, but is, (to borrow a fancy of Dryden,) \"as the Morning of the\r\nMind,\" bringing new objects and images successively into view, and\r\nscattering its own fresh light over all. Such a visit, therefore, could\r\nnot fail to be soothing and gratifying to Sheridan; and, on parting, both\r\nLord Holland and Mr. Rogers comforted him with the assurance that some\r\nsteps should be taken to ward off the immediate evils that he dreaded.\r\n\r\nAn evening or two after, (Wednesday, May 15,) I was with Mr. Rogers,\r\nwhen, on returning home, he found the following afflicting note upon his\r\ntable:--\r\n\r\n\"_Saville-Row_.\r\n\r\n\"I find things settled so that 150_l_. will remove all difficulty. I\r\nam absolutely undone and broken-hearted. I shall negotiate for the Plays\r\nsuccessfully in the course of a week, when all shall be returned. I have\r\ndesired Fairbrother to get back the Guarantee for thirty.\r\n\r\n\"They are going to put the carpets out of window, and break into Mrs.\r\nS.'s room and _take me_--for God's sake let me see you.\r\n\r\n\"R. B. S.\"\r\n\r\nIt was too late to do any thing when this note was received, being then\r\nbetween twelve and one at night; but Mr. Rogers and I walked down to\r\nSaville-Row together to assure ourselves that the threatened arrest had\r\nnot yet been put in execution. A servant spoke to us out of the area, and\r\nsaid that all was safe for the night, but that it was intended, in\r\npursuance of this new proceeding, to paste bills over the front of the\r\nhouse next day.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning I was early with Mr. Rogers, and willingly\r\nundertook to be the bearer of a draft for 150_l_. [Footnote: Lord\r\nHolland afterwards insisted upon paying the half of this sum,--which was\r\nnot the first of the same amount that my liberal friend, Mr. Rogers, had\r\nadvanced for Sheridan.] to Saville-Row. I found Mr. Sheridan good-natured\r\nand cordial as ever; and though he was then within a few weeks of his\r\ndeath, his voice had not lost its fulness or strength, nor was that\r\nlustre, for which his eyes were so remarkable, diminished. He showed,\r\ntoo, his usual sanguineness of disposition in speaking of the price that\r\nhe expected for his Dramatic Works, and of the certainty he felt of being\r\nable to arrange all his affairs, if his complaint would but suffer him to\r\nleave his bed. In the following month, his powers began rapidly to fail\r\nhim;--his stomach was completely worn out, and could no longer bear any\r\nkind of sustenance. During the whole of this time, as far as I can learn,\r\nit does not appear that, (with the exceptions I have mentioned,) any one\r\nof his Noble or Royal friends ever called at his door, or even sent to\r\ninquire after him!\r\n\r\nAbout this period Doctor Bain received the following note from Mr.\r\nVaughan:--\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"An apology in a case of humanity is scarcely necessary, besides I have\r\nthe honor of a slight acquaintance with you. A friend of mine, hearing of\r\n_our friend_ Sheridan's forlorn situation, and that he has neither\r\nmoney nor credit for a few comforts, has employed me to convey a small\r\nsum for his use, through such channel as I think right. I can devise none\r\nbetter than through you. If I had had the good fortune to have seen you,\r\nI should have left for this purpose a draft for 50_l_. Perhaps as\r\nmuch more might be had if it will be conducive to a good end--of course\r\nyou must feel it is not for the purpose of satisfying troublesome people.\r\nI will say more to you if you will do me the honor of a call in your way\r\nto Saville-Street to-morrow. I am a mere agent.\r\n\r\n\"I am,\r\n\r\n\"My dear Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Most truly yours,\r\n\r\n\"23, _Grafton-Street_.\r\n\r\n\"JOHN TAYLOR VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\n\"If I should not see you before twelve, I will come through the passage\r\nto you.\"\r\n\r\nIn his interview with Dr. Bain, Mr. Vaughan stated, that the sum thus\r\nplaced at his disposal was, in all, 200_l_.; [Footnote: Mr. Vaughan\r\ndid not give Doctor Bain to understand that he was authorized to go\r\nbeyond the 200_l_.; but, in a conversation which I had with him a\r\nyear or two after, in contemplation of this Memoir, he told me that a\r\nfurther supply was intended.] and the proposition being submitted to Mrs.\r\nSheridan, that lady, after consulting with some of her relatives,\r\nreturned for answer that, as there was a sufficiency of means to provide\r\nall that was necessary for her husband's comfort, as well as her own, she\r\nbegged leave to decline the offer.\r\n\r\nMr. Vaughan always said, that the donation, thus meant to be doled out,\r\ncame from a Royal hand;--but this is hardly credible. It would be safer,\r\nperhaps, to let the suspicion rest upon that gentleman's memory, of\r\nhaving indulged his own benevolent disposition in this disguise, than to\r\nsuppose it possible that so scanty and reluctant a benefaction was the\r\nsole mark of attention accorded by a \"gracious Prince and Master\"\r\n[Footnote: See Sheridan's Letter, page 268.] to the last, death-bed wants\r\nof one of the most accomplished and faithful servants, that Royalty ever\r\nyet raised or ruined by its smiles. When the philosopher Anaxagoras lay\r\ndying for want of sustenance, his great pupil, Pericles, sent him a sum\r\nof money. \"Take it back,\" said Anaxagoras--\"if he wished to keep the lamp\r\nalive, he ought to have administered the oil before!\"\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the clamors and incursions of creditors increased. A\r\nsheriff's officer at length arrested the dying man in his bed, and was\r\nabout to carry him off, in his blankets, to a spunging-house, when Doctor\r\nBain interfered--and, by threatening the officer with the responsibility\r\nhe must incur, if, as was but too probable, his prisoner should expire on\r\nthe way, averted this outrage.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of June, the attention and sympathy of the Public were,\r\nfor the first time, awakened to the desolate situation of Sheridan, by an\r\narticle that appeared in the Morning Post,--written, as I understand, by\r\na gentleman, who, though on no very cordial terms with him, forgot every\r\nother feeling in a generous pity for his fate, and in honest indignation\r\nagainst those who now deserted him. \"Oh delay not,\" said the writer,\r\nwithout naming the person to whom he alluded--\"delay not to draw aside\r\nthe curtain within which that proud spirit hides its sufferings.\" He then\r\nadds, with a striking anticipation of what afterwards happened:--\"Prefer\r\nministering in the chamber of sickness to mustering at\r\n\r\n  'The splendid sorrows that adorn the hearse;'\r\n\r\nI say, _Life_ and _Succor_ against Westminster-Abbey and a\r\nFuneral!\"\r\n\r\nThis article produced a strong and general sensation, and was reprinted\r\nin the same paper the following day. Its effect, too, was soon visible in\r\nthe calls made at Sheridan's door, and in the appearance of such names as\r\nthe Duke of York, the Duke of Argyle, &c. among the visitors. But it was\r\nnow too late;--the spirit, that these unavailing tributes might once have\r\ncomforted, was now fast losing the consciousness of every thing earthly,\r\nbut pain. After a succession of shivering fits, he fell into a state of\r\nexhaustion, in which he continued, with but few more signs of suffering,\r\ntill his death. A day or two before that event, the Bishop of London read\r\nprayers by his bed-side; and on Sunday, the seventh of July, in the\r\nsixty-fifth year of his age, he died.\r\n\r\nOn the following Saturday the Funeral took place;--his remains having\r\nbeen previously removed from Saville-Row to the house of his friend, Mr.\r\nPeter Moore, in Great George-Street, Westminster. From thence, at one\r\no'clock, the procession moved on foot to the Abbey, where, in the only\r\nspot in Poet's Corner that remained unoccupied, the body was interred;\r\nand the following simple inscription marks its resting-place:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN,\r\n\r\nBORN, 1751,\r\n\r\nDIED, 7th JULY, 1816.\r\n\r\nTHIS MARBLE IS THE TRIBUTE OF AN ATTACHED\r\n\r\nFRIEND,\r\n\r\nPETER MOORE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSeldom has there been seen such an array of rank as graced this Funeral.\r\n[Footnote: It was well remarked by a French Journal, in contrasting the\r\npenury of Sheridan's latter years with the splendor of his Funeral, that\r\n\"France is the place for a man of letters to live in, and England the\r\nplace for him to die in.\"] The Pall-bearers were the Duke of Bedford, the\r\nEarl of Lauderdale, Earl Mulgrave, the Lord Bishop of London, Lord\r\nHolland, and Lord Spencer. Among the mourners were His Royal Highness the\r\nDuke of York, His Royal Highness the Duke of Sussex, the Duke of Argyle,\r\nthe Marquisses of Anglesea and Tavistock; the Earls of Thanet, Jersey,\r\nHarrington, Besborough, Mexborough, Rosslyn, and Yarmouth; Lords George\r\nCavendish and Robert Spencer; Viscounts Sidmouth, Granville, and\r\nDuncannon; Lords Rivers, Erskine, and Lynedoch; the Lord Mayor; Right\r\nHon. G. Canning and W. W. Pole, &c., &c. [Footnote: In the train of all\r\nthis phalanx of Dukes, Marquisses, Earls, Viscounts, Barons, Honorables,\r\nand Right Honorables, Princes of the Blood Royal, and First Officers of\r\nthe State, it was not a little interesting to see, walking humbly, side\r\nby side, the only two men whose friendship had not waited for the call of\r\nvanity to display itself--Dr. Bain and Mr. Rogers.]\r\n\r\nWhere were they all, these Royal and Noble persons, who now crowded to\r\n\"partake the gale\" of Sheridan's glory--where were they all while any\r\nlife remained in him? Where were they all, but a few weeks before, when\r\ntheir interposition might have saved his heart from breaking,--or when\r\nthe zeal, now wasted on the grave, might have soothed and comforted the\r\ndeath-bed? This is a subject on which it is difficult to speak with\r\npatience. If the man was unworthy of the commonest offices of humanity\r\nwhile he lived, why all this parade of regret and homage over his tomb?\r\n\r\nThere appeared some verses at the time, which, however intemperate in\r\ntheir satire and careless in their style, came, evidently, warm from the\r\nheart of the writer, and contained sentiments to which, even in his\r\ncooler moments, he needs not hesitate to subscribe:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Oh it sickens the heart to see bosoms so hollow,\r\n    And friendships so false in the great and high-born;--\r\n  To think what a long line of Titles may follow\r\n    The relics of him who died, friendless and lorn!\r\n\r\n  \"How proud they can press to the funeral array\r\n    Of him whom they shunn'd, in his sickness and sorrow--\r\n  How bailiffs may seize his last blanket to-day,\r\n    Whose pall shall be held up by Nobles to-morrow!\"\r\n\r\nThe anonymous writer thus characterizes the talents of Sheridan:--\r\n\r\n  \"Was this, then, the fate of that high-gifted man,\r\n    The pride of the palace, the bower, and the hall--\r\n  The orator, dramatist, minstrel,--who ran\r\n    Through each mode of the lyre, and was master of all.\r\n\r\n  \"Whose mind was an essence, compounded, with art,\r\n    From the finest and best of all other men's powers;--\r\n  Who rul'd, like a wizard, the world of the heart,\r\n    And could call up its sunshine, or draw down its showers;--\r\n\r\n  \"Whose humor, as gay as the fire-fly's light,\r\n    Play'd round every subject, and shone, as it play'd;--\r\n  Whose wit, in the combat as gentle as bright,\r\n    Ne'er carried a heart-stain away on its blade;--\r\n\r\n  \"Whose eloquence brightened whatever it tried,\r\n    Whether reason or fancy, the gay or the grave,\r\n  Was as rapid, as deep, and as brilliant a tide,\r\n    As ever bore Freedom aloft on its wave!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough a perusal of the foregoing pages has, I trust, sufficiently\r\nfurnished the reader with materials out of which to form his own estimate\r\nof the character of Sheridan, a few general remarks may, at parting, be\r\nallowed me--rather with a view to convey the impressions left upon\r\nmyself, than with any presumptuous hope of influencing the deductions of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIn considering the intellectual powers of this extraordinary man, the\r\ncircumstance that first strikes us is the very scanty foundation of\r\ninstruction, upon which he contrived to raise himself to such eminence\r\nboth as a writer and a politician. It is true, in the line of authorship\r\nhe pursued, erudition was not so much wanting; and his wit, like the\r\nlaurel of Caesar, was leafy enough to hide any bareness in this respect.\r\nIn politics, too, he had the advantage of entering upon his career, at a\r\ntime when habits of business and a knowledge of details were less looked\r\nfor in public men than they are at present, and when the House of Commons\r\nwas, for various reasons, a more open play-ground for eloquence and wit.\r\nThe great increase of public business, since then, has necessarily made a\r\nconsiderable change in this respect. Not only has the time of the\r\nLegislature become too precious to be wasted upon the mere gymnastics of\r\nrhetoric, but even those graces, with which true Oratory surrounds her\r\nstatements, are but impatiently borne, where the statement itself is the\r\nprimary and pressing object of the hearer. [Footnote: The new light that\r\nas been thrown on Political Science may also, perhaps, be assigned as a\r\nreason for this evident revolution in Parliamentary taste. \"Truth.\" says\r\nLord Bacon, \"is a naked and open daylight, that doth not show the\r\nmasques, and mummeries, and triumphs of the present world half so stately\r\nand daintily as candle-lights;\"--and there can be little doubt that the\r\nclearer and important truths are made, the less controversy they will\r\nexcite among fair and rational men, and the less passion and fancy\r\naccordingly can eloquence infuse into the discussion of them. Mathematics\r\nhave produced no quarrels among mankind--it is by the mysterious and the\r\nvague, that temper as well as imagination is most roused. In proof of\r\nthis while the acknowledged clearness almost to truism, which the leading\r\nprinciples of Political Science have attained, has tended to simplify and\r\ntame down the activities of eloquence on that subject. There is still\r\nanother arena left, in the science of the Law, where the same\r\nillumination of truth has not yet penetrated, and where Oratory will\r\nstill continue to work her perplexing spells, till Common Sense and the\r\nplain principles of Utility shall find their way there also to weaken\r\nthem.] Burke, we know, was, even for his own time, too much addicted to\r\nwhat falconers would call _raking_, or flying wide of his game; but\r\nthere was hardly, perhaps, one among his great contemporaries, who, if\r\nbeginning his career at present, would not find it, in some degree,\r\nnecessary to conform his style to the taste for business and\r\nmatter-of-fact that is prevalent. Mr. Pitt would be compelled to curtail\r\nthe march of his sentences--Mr. Fox would learn to repeat himself less\r\nlavishly--nor would Mr. Sheridan venture to enliven a question of\r\nevidence by a long and pathetic appeal to Filial Piety.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this change in the character and taste of the House of\r\nCommons, which, while it has lowered the value of some of the\r\nqualifications possessed by Sheridan, has created a demand for others of\r\na more useful but less splendid kind, which his education and habits of\r\nlife would have rendered less easily attainable by him, we must take also\r\ninto account the prodigious difference produced by the general movement,\r\nat present, of the whole civilized world towards knowledge;--a movement,\r\nwhich no public man, however great his natural talents, could now lag\r\nbehind with impunity, and which requires nothing less than the versatile\r\nand _encyclopaedic_ powers of a Brougham to keep pace with it.\r\n\r\nAnother striking characteristic of Sheridan, as an orator and a writer,\r\nwas the great degree of labor and preparation which his productions in\r\nboth lines cost him. Of this the reader has seen some curious proofs in\r\nthe preceding pages. Though the papers left behind by him have added\r\nnothing to the stock of his _chef-d'oeuvres_, they have given us an\r\ninsight into his manner of producing his great works, which is, perhaps,\r\nthe next most interesting thing to the works themselves. Though no new\r\nstar has been discovered, the history of the formation of those we\r\nalready possess, and of the gradual process by which they were brought\r\n\"firm to retain their gathered beams,\" has, as in the instance of The\r\nSchool for Scandal, been most interestingly unfolded to us.\r\n\r\nThe same marks of labor are discoverable throughout the whole of his\r\nParliamentary career. He never made a speech of any moment, of which the\r\nsketch, more or less detailed, has not been found among his papers--with\r\nthe showier passages generally written two or three times over, (often\r\nwithout any material change in their form,) upon small detached pieces of\r\npaper, or on cards. To such minutiae of effect did he attend, that I have\r\nfound, in more than one instance, a memorandum made of the precise place\r\nin which the words \"Good God, Mr. Speaker,\" were to be introduced. These\r\npreparatory sketches are continued down to his latest displays; and it is\r\nobservable that when from the increased derangement of his affairs, he\r\nhad no longer leisure or collectedness enough to prepare, he ceased to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nThe only time he could have found for this pre-arrangement of his\r\nthoughts, (of which few, from the apparent idleness of his life,\r\nsuspected him,) must have been during the many hours of the day that he\r\nremained in bed,--when, frequently, while the world gave him credit for\r\nbeing asleep, he was employed in laying the frame-work of his wit and\r\neloquence for the evening.\r\n\r\nThat this habit of premeditation was not altogether owing to a want of\r\nquickness, appears from the power and liveliness of his replies in\r\nParliament, and the vivacity of some of his retorts in conversation.\r\n[Footnote: His best _bon mots_ are in the memory of every one. Among\r\nthose less known, perhaps, is his answer to General T----, relative to\r\nsome difference of opinion between them on the War in Spain:--\"Well,\r\nT----, are you still on your high horse?\"--\"If I was on a horse before, I\r\nam upon an elephant now.\" \"No, T----, you were upon an _ass_ before,\r\nnow you are upon a _mule_.\"\r\n\r\nSome mention having been made in his presence of a Tax upon Milestones.\r\nSheridan said, \"such a tax would be unconstitutional,--as they were a\r\nrace that could not meet to remonstrate.\"\r\n\r\nAs an instance of his humor, I have been told that, in some country-house\r\nwhere he was on a visit, an elderly maiden lady having set her heart on\r\nbeing his companion in a walk, he excused himself at first on account of\r\nthe badness of the weather. Soon afterwards, however, the lady\r\nintercepted him in an attempt to escape without her:--\"Well,\" she said,\r\n\"it has cleared up, I see.\" \"Why, yes,\" he answered, \"it has cleared up\r\nenough for _one_, but not for _two_.\"] The labor, indeed, which\r\nhe found necessary for his public displays, was, in a great degree, the\r\ncombined effect of his ignorance and his taste;--the one rendering him\r\nfearful of committing himself on the _matter_ of his task, and the\r\nother making him fastidious and hesitating as to the _manner_ of it.\r\nI cannot help thinking, however, that there must have been, also, a\r\ndegree of natural slowness in the first movements of his mind upon any\r\ntopic; and, that, like those animals which remain gazing upon their prey\r\nbefore they seize it, he found it necessary to look intently at his\r\nsubject for some time, before he was able to make the last, quick spring\r\nthat mastered it.\r\n\r\nAmong the proofs of this dependence of his fancy upon time and thought\r\nfor its development, may be mentioned his familiar letters, as far as\r\ntheir fewness enables us to judge. Had his wit been a \"fruit, that would\r\nfall without shaking,\" we should, in these communications at least, find\r\nsome casual windfalls of it. But, from the want of sufficient time to\r\nsearch and cull, he seems to have given up, in despair, all thoughts of\r\nbeing lively in his letters; and accordingly, as the reader must have\r\nobserved in the specimens that have been given, his compositions in this\r\nway are not only unenlivened by any excursions beyond the bounds of mere\r\nmatter of fact, but, from the habit or necessity of taking a certain\r\nportion of time for correction, are singularly confused, disjointed, and\r\ninelegant in their style.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that even his _bon-mots_ in society were not always to\r\nbe set down to the credit of the occasion; but that frequently, like\r\nskilful priests, he prepared the miracle of the moment before-hand.\r\nNothing, indeed, could be more remarkable than the patience and tact,\r\nwith which he would wait through a whole evening for the exact moment,\r\nwhen the shaft which he had ready feathered, might be let fly with\r\neffect. There was no effort, either obvious or disguised, to lead to the\r\nsubject--no \"question detached, (as he himself expresses it,) to draw you\r\ninto the ambuscade of his ready-made joke\"--and, when the lucky moment\r\ndid arrive, the natural and accidental manner in which he would let this\r\ntreasured sentence fall from his lips, considerably added to the\r\nastonishment and the charm. So bright a thing, produced so easily, seemed\r\nlike the delivery of Wieland's [Footnote: See Sotheby's admirable\r\nTranslation of Oberon, Canto 9.] Amanda in a dream;--and his own apparent\r\nunconsciousness of the value of what he said might have deceived dull\r\npeople into the idea that there was really nothing in it.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this practice of waiting for the moment of effect was,\r\n(as all, who have been much in his society, must have observed,) that he\r\nwould remain inert in conversation, and even taciturn, for hours, and\r\nthen suddenly come out with some brilliant sally, which threw a light\r\nover the whole evening, and was carried away in the memories of all\r\npresent. Nor must it be supposed that in the intervals, either before or\r\nafter these flashes, he ceased to be agreeable; on the contrary, he had a\r\ngrace and good nature in his manner, which gave a charm to even his most\r\nordinary sayings,--and there was, besides, that ever-speaking lustre in\r\nhis eye, which made it impossible, even when he was silent, to forget who\r\nhe was.\r\n\r\nA curious instance of the care with which he treasured up the felicities\r\nof his wit, appears in the use he made of one of those epigrammatic\r\npassages, which the reader may remember among the memorandums for his\r\nComedy of Affectation, and which, in its first form, ran thus:--\"He\r\ncertainly has a great deal of fancy, and a very good memory; but, with a\r\nperverse ingenuity, he employs these qualities as no other person\r\ndoes--for he employs his fancy in his narratives, and keeps his\r\nrecollection for his wit:--when he makes his jokes, you applaud the\r\naccuracy of his memory, and 'tis only when he states his facts that you\r\nadmire the flights of his imagination.\" After many efforts to express\r\nthis thought more concisely, and to reduce the language of it to that\r\ncondensed and elastic state, in which alone it gives force to the\r\nprojectiles of wit, he kept the passage by him patiently some\r\nyears,--till at length he found an opportunity of turning it to account,\r\nin a reply, I believe, to Mr. Dundas, in the House of Commons, when, with\r\nthe most extemporaneous air, he brought it forth, in the following\r\ncompact and pointed form:--\"The Right Honorable Gentleman is indebted to\r\nhis memory for his jests, and to his imagination for his facts.\"\r\n\r\nHis Political Character stands out so fully in these pages, that it is\r\nneedless, by any comments, to attempt to raise it into stronger relief.\r\nIf to watch over the Rights of the Subject, and guard them against the\r\nencroachments of Power, be, even in safe and ordinary times, a task full\r\nof usefulness and honor, how much more glorious to have stood sentinel\r\nover the same sacred trust, through a period so trying as that with which\r\nSheridan had to struggle--when Liberty itself had become suspected and\r\nunpopular--when Authority had succeeded in identifying patriotism with\r\ntreason, and when the few remaining and deserted friends of Freedom were\r\nreduced to take their stand on a narrowing isthmus, between Anarchy on\r\none side, and the angry incursions of Power on the other. How manfully he\r\nmaintained his ground in a position so critical, the annals of England\r\nand of the Champions of her Constitution will long testify. The truly\r\nnational spirit, too, with which, when that struggle was past, and the\r\ndangers to liberty from without seemed greater than any from within, he\r\nforgot all past differences, in the one common cause of Englishmen, and,\r\nwhile others \"gave but the _left_ hand to the Country,\" [Footnote:\r\nHis own words] proffered her _both_ of his, stamped a seal of\r\nsincerity on his public conduct, which, in the eyes of all England,\r\nauthenticated it as genuine patriotism.\r\n\r\nTo his own party, it is true, his conduct presented a very different\r\nphasis; and if implicit partisanship were the sole merit of a public man,\r\nhis movements, at this and other junctures, were far too independent and\r\nunharnessed to lay claim to it. But, however useful may be the bond of\r\nParty, there are occasions that supersede it; and, in all such deviations\r\nfrom the fidelity which it enjoins, the two questions to be asked\r\nare--were they, as regarded the Public, right? were they, as regarded the\r\nindividual himself, unpurchased? To the former question, in the instance\r\nof Sheridan, the whole country responded in the affirmative; and to the\r\nlatter, his account with the Treasury, from first to last, is a\r\nsufficient answer.\r\n\r\nEven, however, on the score of fidelity to Party, when we recollect that\r\nhe more than once submitted to some of the worst martyrdoms which it\r\nimposes--that of sharing in the responsibility of opinions from which he\r\ndissented, and suffering by the ill consequences of measures against\r\nwhich he had protested;--when we call to mind, too, that during the\r\nAdministration of Mr. Addington, though agreeing wholly with the Ministry\r\nand differing with the Whigs, he even then refused to profit by a\r\nposition so favorable to his interests, and submitted, like certain\r\nreligionists, from a point of honor, to suffer for a faith in which he\r\ndid not believe--it seems impossible not to concede that even to the\r\nobligations of Party he was as faithful as could be expected from a\r\nspirit that so far outgrew its limits, and, in paying the tax of fidelity\r\nwhile he asserted the freedom of dissent, showed that he could sacrifice\r\nevery thing to it, except his opinion. Through all these occasional\r\nvariations, too, he remained a genuine Whig to the last; and, as I have\r\nheard one of his own party happily express it, was \"like pure gold, that\r\nchanges color in the fire, but comes out unaltered.\"\r\n\r\nThe transaction in 1812, relative to the Household, was, as I have\r\nalready said, the least defensible part of his public life. But it should\r\nbe recollected hove broken he was, both in mind and body, at that\r\nperiod;--his resources from the Theatre at an end,--the shelter of\r\nParliament about to be taken from over his head also,--and old age and\r\nsickness coming on, as every hope and comfort vanished. In that wreck of\r\nall around him, the friendship of Carlton-House was the last asylum left\r\nto his pride and his hope; and that even character itself should, in a\r\ntoo zealous moment, have been one of the sacrifices offered up at the\r\nshrine that protected him, is a subject more of deep regret than of\r\nwonder. The poet Cowley, in speaking of the unproductiveness of those\r\npursuits connected with Wit and Fancy, says beautifully--\r\n\r\n  \"Where such fairies once have danc'd, no grass will ever grow;\"\r\n\r\nbut, unfortunately, thorns _will_ grow there;--and he who walks\r\nunsteadily among such thorns as now beset the once enchanted path of\r\nSheridan, ought not, after all, to be very severely criticised.\r\n\r\nHis social qualities were, unluckily for himself but too attractive. In\r\naddition to his powers of conversation, there was a well-bred good-nature\r\nin his manner, as well as a deference to the remarks and opinions of\r\nothers, the want of which very often, in distinguished wits, offends the\r\nself-love of their hearers, and makes even the dues of admiration that\r\nthey levy a sort of \"_Droit de Seigneur_,\" paid with unwillingness\r\nand distaste.\r\n\r\nNo one was so ready and cheerful in promoting the amusements of a\r\ncountry-house; and on a rural excursion he was always the soul of the\r\nparty. His talent at dressing a little dish was often put in requisition\r\non such occasions, and an Irish stew was that on which he particularly\r\nplumed himself. Some friends of his recall with delight a day of this\r\nkind which they passed with him, when he made the whole party act over\r\nthe Battle of the Pyramids on Marsden Moor, and ordered \"Captain\" Creevey\r\nand others upon various services, against the cows and donkeys entrenched\r\nin the ditches. Being of so playful a disposition himself, it was not\r\nwonderful that he should take such pleasure in the society of children. I\r\nhave been told, as doubly characteristic of him, that he has often, at\r\nMr. Monckton's, kept a chaise and four waiting half the day for him at\r\nthe door, while he romped with the children.\r\n\r\nIn what are called _Ver de Sociétié_, or drawing-room verses, he\r\ntook great delight; and there remain among his papers several sketches of\r\nthese trifles. I once heard him repeat in a ballroom, some verses which\r\nhe had lately written on Waltzing, and of which I remember the following:\r\n\r\n  \"With tranquil step, and timid, downcast glance,\r\n  Behold the well-pair'd couple now advance.\r\n  In such sweet posture our first Parents mov'd,\r\n  While, hand in hand, through Eden's bowers they rov'd;\r\n  Ere yet the Devil, with promise foul and false,\r\n  Turn'd their poor heads and taught them how to _Walse_.\r\n  One hand grasps hers, the other holds her hip--\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n  For so the Law's laid down by Baron Trip.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote: This gentleman, whose name suits so aptly as legal authority\r\non the subject of Waltzing, was at the time these verses were written,\r\nwell known in the dancing circles.]\r\n\r\nHe had a sort of hereditary fancy for difficult trifling in\r\npoetry;--particularly for that sort, which consists in rhyming to the\r\nsame word through a long string of couplets, till every rhyme that the\r\nlanguage supplies for it is exhausted, [Footnote: Some verses by General\r\nFitzpatrick on Lord Holland's father are the best specimen that I know of\r\nthis sort of _Scherzo_.] The following are specimens from a poem of\r\nthis kind, which he wrote on the loss of a lady's trunk:--\r\n\r\n\"MY TRUNK!\r\n\r\n\"(_To Anne_.)\r\n\r\n  \"Have you heard, my deer Anne, how my spirits are sunk?\r\n  Have you heard of the cause? Oh, the loss of my _Trunk_!\r\n  From exertion or firmness I've never yet slunk;\r\n  But my fortitude's gone with the loss of my _Trunk_!\r\n  Stout Lucy, my maid, is a damsel of spunk;\r\n  Yet she weeps night and day for the loss of my _Trunk_!\r\n  I'd better turn nun, and coquet with a monk;\r\n  For with whom can I flirt without aid from my _Trunk_!\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n  Accurs'd be the thief, the old rascally hunks;\r\n  Who rifles the fair, and lays hands on their _Trunks_!\r\n  He, who robs the King's stores of the least bit of junk,\r\n  Is hang'd--while he's safe, who has plunder'd my _Trunk_!\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n  There's a phrase amongst lawyers, when _nune's_ put for _tune_;\r\n  But, tune and nune both, must I grieve for my _Trunk_!\r\n  Huge leaves of that great commentator, old Brunck,\r\n  Perhaps was the paper that lin'd my poor _Trunk_!\r\n  But my rhymes are all out;--for I dare not use st--k; [1]\r\n  'Twould shock Sheridan more than the loss of my _Trunk_!\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: He had a particular horror of this word.]\r\n\r\nFrom another of these trifles, (which, no doubt, produced much gaiety at\r\nthe breakfast-table,) the following extracts will be sufficient:--\r\n\r\n  \"Muse, assist me to complain,\r\n  While I grieve for Lady _Jane_.\r\n  I ne'er was in so sad a vein,\r\n  Deserted now by Lady _Jane_.\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n  Lord Petre's house was built by Payne--\r\n  No mortal architect made _Jane_.\r\n  If hearts had windows, through the pane\r\n  Of mine you'd see sweet Lady _Jane_.\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n  At breakfast I could scarce refrain\r\n  From tears at missing lovely _Jane_,\r\n  Nine rolls I eat, in hopes to gain\r\n  The roll that might have fall'n to _Jane_,\" &c.\r\n\r\nAnother written on a Mr. _Bigg_, contains some ludicrous couplets:--\r\n\r\n  \"I own he's not fam'd for a reel or a jig,\r\n  Tom Sheridan there surpasses Tom _Bigg_.--\r\n  For lam'd in one thigh, he is obliged to go zig-\r\n  Zag, like a crab--for no dancer is _Bigg_.\r\n  Those who think him a coxcomb, or call him a prig,\r\n  How little they know of the mind of my _Bigg_!\r\n  Tho' he ne'er can be mine, Hope will catch a twig--\r\n  Two Deaths--and I yet may become Mrs. _Bigg_.\r\n  Oh give me, with him, but a cottage and pig,\r\n  And content I would live on Beans, Bacon, and _Bigg_.\"\r\n\r\nA few more of these light productions remain among his papers, but their\r\nwit is gone with those for whom they were written;--the wings of Time\r\n\"eripuere _jocos_.\"\r\n\r\nOf a very different description are the following striking and spirited\r\nfragments, (which ought to have been mentioned in a former part of this\r\nwork,) written by him, apparently, about the year 1794, and addressed to\r\nthe Naval heroes of that period, to console them for the neglect they\r\nexperienced from the Government, while ribands and titles were lavished\r\non the Whig Seceders:--\r\n\r\n  \"Never mind them, brave black Dick,\r\n  Though they've played thee such a trick--\r\n  Damn their ribands and their garters,\r\n  Get you to your post and quarters.\r\n  Look upon the azure sea,\r\n  There's a Sailor's Taffety!\r\n  Mark the Zodiac's radiant bow,\r\n  That's a collar fit for HOWE!--\r\n  And, then P--tl--d's brighter far,\r\n  The Pole shall furnish you a Star!

'tis blue,'\r\n  And, like him--stain your honor too?\r\n  Damn their ribands and their garters,\r\n  Get you to your post and quarters.\r\n  On the foes of Britain close,\r\n  While B----k garters his Dutch hose,\r\n  And cons, with spectacles on nose,\r\n  (While to battle _you_ advance,)\r\n  His '_Honi soit qui mal y pense_.'\"\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n[Footnote 1: This reminds me of a happy application which he made, upon a\r\nsubsequent occasion, of two lines of Dryden:--\r\n\r\n  \"When men like Erskine go astray,\r\n  The stars are more in fault than they.\"]\r\n\r\nIt has been seen, by a letter of his sister already given, that, when\r\nyoung, he was generally accounted handsome; but, in later years, his eyes\r\nwere the only testimonials of beauty that remained to him. It was,\r\nindeed, in the upper part of his face that the Spirit of the man chiefly\r\nreigned;--the dominion of the world and the Senses being rather strongly\r\nmarked out in the lower. In his person, he was above the middle size, and\r\nhis general make was, as I have already said, robust and well\r\nproportioned. It is remarkable that his arms, though of powerful\r\nstrength, were thin, and appeared by no means muscular. His hands were\r\nsmall and delicate; and the following couplet, written on a cast from one\r\nof them, very livelily enumerates both its physical and moral qualities:--\r\n\r\n  \"Good at a Fight, but better at a Play,\r\n  Godlike in giving, but--the Devil to Pay!\"\r\n\r\nAmong his habits, it may not be uninteresting to know that his hours of\r\ncomposition, as long as he continued to be an author, were at night, and\r\nthat he required a profusion of lights around him while he wrote. Wine,\r\ntoo, was one of his favorite helps to inspiration;--\"If the thought, (he\r\nwould say,) is slow to come, a glass of good wine encourages it, and,\r\nwhen it _does_ come, a glass of good wine rewards it.\"\r\n\r\nHaving taken a cursory view of his Literary, Political, and Social\r\nqualities, it remains for me to say a few words upon that most important\r\npoint of all, his Moral character.\r\n\r\nThere are few persons, as we have seen, to whose kind and affectionate\r\nconduct, in some of the most interesting relations of domestic life, so\r\nmany strong and honorable testimonies remain. The pains he took to win\r\nback the estranged feelings of his father, and the filial tenderness with\r\nwhich he repaid long years of parental caprice, show a heart that had, at\r\nleast, set out by the right road, however, in after years, it may have\r\nmissed the way. The enthusiastic love which his sister bore him, and\r\nretained unblighted by distance or neglect, is another proof of the\r\ninfluence of his amiable feelings, at that period of life when he was as\r\nyet unspoiled by the world. We have seen the romantic fondness which he\r\npreserved towards the first Mrs. Sheridan, even while doing his utmost,\r\nand in vain, to extinguish the same feeling in her. With the second wife,\r\na course, nearly similar, was run;--the same \"scatterings and eclipses\"\r\nof affection, from the irregularities and vanities, in which he continued\r\nto indulge, but the same hold kept of each other's hearts to the last.\r\nHer early letters to him breathe a passion little short of idolatry, and\r\nher devoted attentions beside his death-bed showed that the essential\r\npart of the feeling still remained.\r\n\r\nTo claim an exemption for frailties and irregularities on the score of\r\ngenius, while there are such names as Milton and Newton on record, were\r\nto be blind to the example which these and other great men have left, of\r\nthe grandest intellectual powers combined with the most virtuous lives.\r\nBut, for the bias given early to the mind by education and circumstances,\r\neven the least charitable may be inclined to make large allowances. We\r\nhave seen how idly the young days of Sheridan were wasted--how soon he\r\nwas left, (in the words of the Prophet,) \"to dwell carelessly ,\" and with\r\nwhat an undisciplined temperament he was thrown upon the world, to meet\r\nat every step that never-failing spring of temptation, which, like the\r\nfatal fountain in the Garden of Armida, sparkles up for ever in the\r\npathway of such a man:--\r\n\r\n  \"Un fonte sorge in lei, che vaghe e monde\r\n   Ha l'acque si, che i riguardanti asseta,\r\n   Ma dentro ai freddi suoi cristalli asconde\r\n   Di tosco estran malvagita secreta.\"\r\n\r\nEven marriage, which is among the sedatives of other men's lives, but\r\nformed a part of the romance of his. The very attractions of his wife\r\nincreased his danger, by doubling, as it were the power of the world over\r\nhim, and leading him astray by her light as well as by his own. Had his\r\ntalents, even then, been subjected to the _manège_ of a profession,\r\nthere was still a chance that business, and the round of regularity which\r\nit requires, might have infused some spirit of order into his life. But\r\nthe Stage--his glory and his ruin--opened upon him; and the property of\r\nwhich it made him master was exactly of that treacherous kind which not\r\nonly deceives a man himself, but enables him to deceive others, and thus\r\ncombined all that a person of his carelessness and ambition had most to\r\ndread. An uncertain income, which, by eluding calculation, gives an\r\nexcuse for improvidence, [Footnote: How feelingly aware he was of this\r\ngreat source of all his misfortunes appears from a passage in the able\r\nspeech which he delivered before the Chancellor, as Counsel in his own\r\ncase, in the year 1799 or 1800:--\r\n\r\n\"It is a great disadvantage, relatively speaking, to any man, and\r\nespecially to a very careless, and a very sanguine man, to have possessed\r\nan uncertain and fluctuating income. That disadvantage is greatly\r\nincreased, if the person so circumstanced has conceived himself to be in\r\nsome degree entitled to presume that, by the exertion of his own talents,\r\nhe may at pleasure increase that income--thereby becoming induced to make\r\npromises to himself which he may afterwards fail to fulfil.\r\n\r\n\"Occasional excess and frequent unpunctuality will be the natural\r\nconsequences of such a situation. But, my Lord, to exceed an ascertained\r\nand limited income, I hold to be a very different matter. In that\r\nsituation I have placed myself, (not since the present unexpected\r\ncontention arose, for since then I would have adopted no arrangements,)\r\nbut months since, by my Deed of Trust to Mr. Adam, and in that situation\r\nI shall remain until every debt on earth, in which the Theatre or I am\r\nconcerned, shall be fully and fairly discharged. Till then I will live on\r\nwhat remains to me--preserving that spirit of undaunted independence,\r\nwhich, both as a public and a private man, I trust, I have hitherto\r\nmaintained.\"] and, still more fatal, a facility of raising money, by\r\nwhich the lesson, that the pressure of distress brings with it, is evaded\r\ntill it comes too late to be of use--such was the dangerous power put\r\ninto his hands, in his six-and-twentieth year, and amidst the\r\nintoxication of as deep and quick draughts of fame as ever young author\r\nquaffed. Scarcely had the zest of this excitement begun to wear off, when\r\nhe was suddenly transported into another sphere, where successes still\r\nmore flattering to his vanity awaited him. Without any increase of means,\r\nhe became the companion and friend of the first Nobles and Princes, and\r\npaid the usual tax of such unequal friendships, by, in the end, losing\r\nthem and ruining himself. The vicissitudes of a political life, and those\r\ndeceitful vistas into office that were for ever opening on his party,\r\nmade his hopes as fluctuating and uncertain as his means, and encouraged\r\nthe same delusive calculations on both. He seemed, at every new turn of\r\naffairs, to be on the point of redeeming himself; and the confidence of\r\nothers in his resources was no less fatal to him than his own, as it but\r\nincreased the facilities of ruin that surrounded him.\r\n\r\nSuch a career as this--so shaped towards wrong, so inevitably devious--it\r\nis impossible to regard otherwise than with the most charitable\r\nallowances. It was one long paroxysm of excitement--no pause for\r\nthought--no inducements to prudence--the attractions all drawing the\r\nwrong way, and a Voice, like that which Bossuet describes, crying\r\ninexorably from behind him \"On, on!\" [Footnote: \"La loi est prononcee; il\r\nfaut avancer toujours. Je voudrois retourner sur mes pas; 'Marche,\r\nMarche!' Un poids invincible nous entraine; il faut sans cesse avancer\r\nvers le precipice. On se console pourtant, parce que de tems en tems on\r\nrencontre des objets qui nous divertissent, des eaux courantes, des\r\nfleurs qui passent. On voudroit arreter; 'Marche, Marche!'\"--_Sermon\r\nsur la Resurrection_.] Instead of wondering at the wreck that followed\r\nall this, our only surprise should be, that so much remained uninjured\r\nthrough the trial,--that his natural good feelings should have struggled\r\nto the last with his habits, and his sense of all that was right in\r\nconduct so long survived his ability to practise it.\r\n\r\nNumerous, however, as were the causes that concurred to disorganize his\r\nmoral character, in his pecuniary embarrassment lay the source of those\r\nblemishes, that discredited him most in the eyes of the world. He might\r\nhave indulged his vanity and his passions, like others, with but little\r\nloss of reputation, if the consequence of these indulgences had not been\r\nobtruded upon observation in the forbidding form of debts and distresses.\r\nSo much did his friend Richardson, who thoroughly knew him, consider his\r\nwhole character to have been influenced by the straitened circumstances\r\nin which he was placed, that he used often to say, \"If an enchanter\r\ncould, by the touch of his wand, endow Sheridan suddenly with fortune, he\r\nwould instantly transform him into a most honorable and moral man.\" As\r\nsome corroboration of this opinion, I must say that, in the course of the\r\ninquiries which my task of biographer imposed upon me, I have found all\r\nwho were ever engaged in pecuniary dealings with him, not excepting those\r\nwho suffered most severely by his irregularities, (among which class I\r\nmay cite the respected name of Mr. Hammersley,) unanimous in expressing\r\ntheir conviction that he always _meant_ fairly and honorably; and\r\nthat to the inevitable pressure of circumstances alone, any failure that\r\noccurred in his engagements was to be imputed.\r\n\r\nThere cannot, indeed, be a stronger exemplification of the truth, that a\r\nwant of regularity [Footnote: His improvidence in every thing connected\r\nwith money was most remarkable. He would frequently be obliged to stop on\r\nhis journies, for want of the means of getting on, and to remain living\r\nexpensively at an inn, till a remittance could reach him. His letters to\r\nthe treasurer of the theatre on these occasions were generally headed\r\nwith the words \"Money-bound.\" A friend of his told me, that one morning,\r\nwhile waiting for him in his study, he cast his eyes over the heap of\r\nunopened letters that lay upon the table, and, seeing one or two with\r\ncoronets on the seals, said to Mr. Westley, the treasurer, who was\r\npresent, \"I see we are all treated alike.\" Mr. Westley then informed him\r\nthat he had once found, on looking over this table, a letter which he had\r\nhimself sent, a few weeks before, to Mr. Sheridan, enclosing a ten-pound\r\nnote, to release him from some inn, but which Sheridan, having raised the\r\nsupplies in some other way, had never thought of opening. The prudent\r\ntreasurer took away the letter, and reserved the enclosure for some\r\nfuture exigence.\r\n\r\nAmong instances of his inattention to letters, the following is\r\nmentioned. Going one day to the banking-house, where he was accustomed to\r\nreceive his salary, as Receiver of Cornwall, and where they sometimes\r\naccommodated him with small sums before the regular time of payment, he\r\nasked, with all due humility, whether they could oblige him with the loan\r\nof twenty pounds. \"Certainly, Sir,\" said the clerk,--\"would you like any\r\nmore--fifty, or a hundred?\" Sheridan, all smiles and gratitude, answered\r\nthat a hundred pounds would be of the greatest convenience to him.\r\n\"Perhaps you would like to take two hundred, or three?\" said the clerk.\r\nAt every increase of the sum, the surprise of the borrower increased.\r\n\"Have not you then received our letter?\" said the clerk;--on which it\r\nturned out that, in consequence of the falling in of some fine, a sum of\r\ntwelve hundred pounds had been lately placed to the credit of the\r\nReceiver-General, and that, from not having opened the letter written to\r\napprise him, he had been left in ignorance of his good luck.] becomes,\r\nitself, a vice, from the manifold evils to which it leads, than the whole\r\nhistory of Mr. Sheridan's pecuniary transactions. So far from never\r\npaying his debts, as is often asserted of him, he was, in fact, always\r\npaying;--but in such a careless and indiscriminate manner, and with so\r\nlittle justice to himself or others, as often to leave the respectable\r\ncreditor to suffer for his patience, while the fraudulent dun was paid\r\ntwo or three times over. Never examining accounts nor referring to\r\nreceipts, he seemed as if, (in imitation of his own Charles, preferring\r\ngenerosity to justice,) he wished to make paying as like as possible to\r\ngiving. Interest, too, with its usual, silent accumulation, swelled every\r\ndebt; and I have found several instances among his accounts where the\r\ninterest upon a small sum had been suffered to increase till it outgrew\r\nthe principal;--\"_minima pars ipsa puella sui_.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, however, his debts were by no means so\r\nconsiderable as has been supposed. In the year 1808, he empowered Sir R.\r\nBerkely, Mr. Peter Moore, and Mr. Frederick Homan, by power of attorney,\r\nto examine into his pecuniary affairs and take measures for the discharge\r\nof all claims upon him. These gentlemen, on examination, found that his\r\n_bona fide_ debts were about ten thousand pounds, while his apparent\r\ndebts amounted to five or six times as much. Whether from\r\nconscientiousness or from pride, however, he would not suffer any of the\r\nclaims to be contested, but said that the demands were all fair, and must\r\nbe paid just as they were stated;--though it was well known that many of\r\nthem had been satisfied more than once. These gentlemen, accordingly,\r\ndeclined to proceed any further with their commission.\r\n\r\nOn the same false feeling he acted in 1813-14, when the balance due on\r\nthe sale of his theatrical property was paid him, in a certain number of\r\nShares. When applied to by any creditor, he would give him one of these\r\nShares, and allowing his claim entirely on his own showing, leave him to\r\npay himself out of it, and refund the balance. Thus irregular at all\r\ntimes, even when most wishing to be right, he deprived honesty itself of\r\nits merit and advantages; and, where he happened to be just, left it\r\ndoubtful, (as Locke says of those religious people, who believe right by\r\nchance, without examination,) \"whether even the luckiness of the accident\r\nexcused the irregularity of the proceeding.\" [Footnote: Chapter on Reason]\r\n\r\nThe consequence, however, of this continual paying was that the number of\r\nhis creditors gradually diminished, and that ultimately the amount of his\r\ndebts was, taking all circumstances into account, by no means\r\nconsiderable. Two years after his death it appeared by a list made up by\r\nhis Solicitor from claims sent in to him, in consequence of an\r\nadvertisement in the newspapers, that the _bonâ fide_ debts amounted\r\nto about five thousand five hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we consider his pecuniary irregularities in reference to\r\nthe injury that they inflicted upon others, the quantum of evil for which\r\nhe is responsible becomes, after all, not so great. There are many\r\npersons in the enjoyment of fair characters in the world, who would be\r\nhappy to have no deeper encroachment upon the property of others to\r\nanswer for; and who may well wonder by what unlucky management Sheridan\r\ncould contrive to found so extensive a reputation for bad pay upon so\r\nsmall an amount of debt.\r\n\r\nLet it never, too, be forgotten, in estimating this part of his\r\ncharacter, that had he been less consistent and disinterested in his\r\npublic conduct, he might have commanded the means of being independent\r\nand respectable in private. He might have died a rich apostate, instead\r\nof closing a life of patriotism in beggary. He might, (to use a fine\r\nexpression of his own,) have 'hid his head in a coronet,' instead of\r\nearning for it but the barren wreath of public gratitude. While,\r\ntherefore, we admire the great sacrifice that he made, let us be tolerant\r\nto the errors and imprudences which it entailed upon him; and,\r\nrecollecting how vain it is to look for any thing unalloyed in this\r\nworld, rest satisfied with the Martyr, without requiring, also, the Saint.\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
