Christopher Gore.--Admission to the Bar of\r\n  Suffolk, Massachusetts.--Commencement of Practice at Boscawen,\r\n  New Hampshire.--Removal to Portsmouth.--Contemporaries in the\r\n  Profession.--Increasing Practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first collection of Mr. Webster's speeches in the Congress of the\r\nUnited States and on various public occasions was published in Boston,\r\nin one volume octavo, in 1830. This volume was more than once reprinted,\r\nand in 1835 a second volume was published, containing the speeches made\r\nup to that time, and not included in the first collection. Several\r\nimpressions of these two volumes were called for by the public. In 1843\r\na third volume was prepared, containing a selection from the speeches of\r\nMr. Webster from the year 1835 till his entrance into the cabinet of\r\nGeneral Harrison. In the year 1848 appeared a fourth volume of\r\ndiplomatic papers, containing a portion of Mr. Webster's official\r\ncorrespondence as Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThe great favor with which these volumes have been received throughout\r\nthe country, and the importance of the subjects discussed in the Senate\r\nof the United States after Mr. Webster's return to that body in 1845,\r\nhave led his friends to think that a valuable service would be rendered\r\nto the community by bringing together his speeches of a later date than\r\nthose contained in the third volume of the former collection, and on\r\npolitical subjects arising since that time. Few periods of our history\r\nwill be entitled to be remembered by events of greater moment, such as\r\nthe admission of Texas to the Union, the settlement of the Oregon\r\ncontroversy, the Mexican war, the acquisition of California and other\r\nMexican provinces, and the exciting questions which have grown out of\r\nthe sudden extension of the territory of the United States. Rarely have\r\npublic discussions been carried on with greater earnestness, with more\r\nimportant consequences visibly at stake, or with greater ability. The\r\nspeeches made by Mr. Webster in the Senate, and on public occasions of\r\nvarious kinds, during the progress of these controversies, are more than\r\nsufficient to fill two new volumes. The opportunity of their collection\r\nhas been taken by the enterprising publishers, in compliance with\r\nopinions often expressed by the most respectable individuals, and with a\r\nmanifest public demand, to bring out a new edition of Mr. Webster's\r\nspeeches in uniform style. Such is the object of the present\r\npublication. The first two volumes contain the speeches delivered by him\r\non a great variety of public occasions, commencing with his discourse at\r\nPlymouth in December, 1820. Three succeeding volumes embrace the greater\r\npart of the speeches delivered in the Massachusetts Convention and in\r\nthe two houses of Congress, beginning with the speech on the Bank of the\r\nUnited States in 1816. The sixth and last volume contains the legal\r\narguments and addresses to the jury, the diplomatic papers, and letters\r\naddressed to various persons on important political questions.\r\n\r\nThe collection does not embrace the entire series of Mr. Webster's\r\nwritings. Such a series would have required a larger number of volumes\r\nthan was deemed advisable with reference to the general circulation of\r\nthe work. A few juvenile performances have accordingly been omitted, as\r\nnot of sufficient importance or maturity to be included in the\r\ncollection. Of the earlier speeches in Congress, some were either not\r\nreported at all, or in a manner too imperfect to be preserved without\r\ndoing injustice to the author. No attempt has been made to collect from\r\nthe contemporaneous newspapers or Congressional registers the short\r\nconversational speeches and remarks made by Mr. Webster, as by other\r\nprominent members of Congress, in the progress of debate, and sometimes\r\nexercising greater influence on the result than the set speeches. Of the\r\naddresses to public meetings it has been found impossible to embrace\r\nmore than a selection, without swelling the work to an unreasonable\r\nsize. It is believed, however, that the contents of these volumes\r\nfurnish a fair specimen of Mr. Webster's opinions and sentiments on all\r\nthe subjects treated, and of his manner of discussing them. The\r\nresponsibility of deciding what should be omitted and what included has\r\nbeen left by Mr. Webster to the friends having the charge of the\r\npublication, and his own opinion on details of this kind has rarely been\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nIn addition to such introductory notices as were deemed expedient\r\nrelative to the occasions and subjects of the various speeches, it has\r\nbeen thought advisable that the collection should be accompanied with a\r\nBiographical Memoir, presenting a condensed view of Mr. Webster's public\r\ncareer, with a few observations by way of commentary on the principal\r\nspeeches. Many things which might otherwise fitly be said in such an\r\nessay must, it is true, be excluded by that delicacy which qualifies the\r\neulogy to be awarded even to the most eminent living worth. Much may be\r\nsafely omitted, as too well known to need repetition in this community,\r\nthough otherwise pertaining to a full survey of Mr. Webster's career. In\r\npreparing the following notice, free use has been made by the writer of\r\nthe biographical sketches already before the public. Justice, however,\r\nrequires that a specific acknowledgment should be made to an article in\r\nthe American Quarterly Review for June, 1831, written, with equal\r\naccuracy and elegance, by Mr. George Ticknor, and containing a\r\ndiscriminating estimate of the speeches embraced in the first\r\ncollection; and also to the highly spirited and vigorous work entitled\r\n\"Reminiscences of Congress,\" by Mr. Charles W. March. To this work the\r\npresent sketch is largely indebted for the account of the parentage and\r\nearly life of Mr. Webster; as well as for a very graphic description of\r\nthe debate on Foot's resolution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe family of Daniel Webster has been established in America from a very\r\nearly period. It was of Scottish origin, but passed some time in England\r\nbefore the final emigration. Thomas Webster, the remotest ancestor who\r\ncan be traced, was settled at Hampton, on the coast of New Hampshire, as\r\nearly as 1636, sixteen years after the landing at Plymouth, and six\r\nyears from the arrival of Governor Winthrop in Massachusetts Bay. The\r\ndescent from Thomas Webster to Daniel can be traced in the church and\r\ntown records of Hampton, Kingston (now East Kingston), and Salisbury.\r\nThese records and the mouldering headstones of village grave-yards are\r\nthe herald's office of the fathers of New England. Noah Webster, the\r\nlearned author of the American Dictionary of the English Language, was\r\nof a collateral branch of the family.\r\n\r\nEbenezer Webster, the father of Daniel, is still recollected in Kingston\r\nand Salisbury. His personal appearance was striking. He was erect, of\r\nathletic stature, six feet high, broad and full in the chest. Long\r\nservice in the wars had given him a military air and carriage. He\r\nbelonged to that intrepid border race, which lined the whole frontier of\r\nthe Anglo-American colonies, by turns farmers, huntsmen, and soldiers,\r\nand passing their lives in one long struggle with the hardships of an\r\ninfant settlement, on the skirts of a primeval forest. Ebenezer Webster\r\nenlisted early in life as a common soldier, in one of those formidable\r\ncompanies of rangers, which rendered such important services under Sir\r\nJeffrey Amherst and Wolfe in the Seven Years' War. He followed the\r\nformer distinguished leader in the invasion of Canada, attracted the\r\nattention and gained the good-will of his superior officers by his brave\r\nand faithful conduct, and rose to the rank of a captain before the end\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\nFor the first half of the last century the settlements of New Hampshire\r\nhad made but little progress into the interior. Every war between France\r\nand Great Britain in Europe was the signal of an irruption of the\r\nCanadian French and their Indian allies into New England. As late as\r\n1755 they sacked villages on the Connecticut River, and John Stark,\r\nwhile hunting on Baker's River, three years before, was taken a prisoner\r\nand sold as a slave into Canada. One can scarcely believe that it is not\r\nyet a hundred years since occurrences like these took place. The cession\r\nof Canada to England by the treaty of 1763 entirely changed this state\r\nof things. It opened the pathways of the forest and the gates of the\r\nWestern hills. The royal governor of New Hampshire, Benning Wentworth,\r\nbegan to make grants of land in the central parts of the State. Colonel\r\nStevens of Kingston, with some of his neighbors, mostly retired officers\r\nand soldiers, obtained a grant of the town of Salisbury, which was at\r\nfirst called Stevenstown, from the principal grantee. This town is\r\nsituated exactly at the point where the Merrimack River is formed by the\r\nconfluence of the Pemigewasset and Winnipiseogee. Captain Webster was\r\none of the settlers of the newly granted township, and received an\r\nallotment in its northerly portion. More adventurous than others of the\r\ncompany, he cut his way deeper into the wilderness, and made the path he\r\ncould not find. At this time his nearest civilized neighbors on the\r\nnorthwest were at Montreal.\r\n\r\nThe following allusion of Mr. Webster to his birthplace will be read\r\nwith interest. It is from a speech delivered before a great public\r\nassembly at Saratoga, in the year 1840.\r\n\r\n  \"It did not happen to me to be born in a log cabin; but my elder\r\n  brothers and sisters were born in a log cabin, raised amid the\r\n  snowdrifts of New Hampshire, at a period so early that, when the\r\n  smoke first rose from its rude chimney, and curled over the frozen\r\n  hills, there was no similar evidence of a white man's habitation\r\n  between it and the settlements on the rivers of Canada. Its remains\r\n  still exist. I make to it an annual visit. I carry my children to it\r\n  to teach them the hardships endured by the generations which have\r\n  gone before them. I love to dwell on the tender recollections, the\r\n  kindred ties, the early affections, and the touching narratives and\r\n  incidents, which mingle with all I know of this primitive family\r\n  abode. I weep to think that none of those who inhabited it are now\r\n  among the living; and if ever I am ashamed of it, or if I ever fail\r\n  in affectionate veneration for HIM who reared and defended it\r\n  against savage violence and destruction, cherished all the domestic\r\n  virtues beneath its roof, and, through the fire and blood of seven\r\n  years' revolutionary war, shrunk from no danger, no toil, no\r\n  sacrifice, to serve his country, and to raise his children to a\r\n  condition better than his own, may my name and the name of my\r\n  posterity be blotted for ever from the memory of mankind!\"\r\n\r\nSoon after his settlement in Salisbury, the first wife of Ebenezer\r\nWebster having deceased, he married Abigail Eastman, who became the\r\nmother of Ezekiel and Daniel Webster, the only sons of the second\r\nmarriage. Like the mothers of so many men of eminence, she was a\r\nwoman of more than ordinary intellect, and possessed a force of\r\ncharacter which was felt throughout the humble circle in which she\r\nmoved. She was proud of her sons and ambitious that they should excel.\r\nHer anticipations went beyond the narrow sphere in which their lot\r\nseemed to be cast, and the distinction attained by both, and especially\r\nby the younger, may well be traced in part to her early promptings\r\nand judicious guidance.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of his second marriage, Captain Ebenezer Webster erected\r\na frame house hard by the log cabin. He dug a well near it and planted\r\nan elm sapling. In this house Daniel Webster was born. It has long since\r\ndisappeared, but the spot where it stood is well known, and is covered\r\nby a house since built. The cellar of the log cabin is still visible,\r\nthough partly filled with the accumulations of seventy years. \"The well\r\nstill remains,\" says Mr. March, \"with water as pure, as cool, and as\r\nlimpid as when first brought to light, and will remain in all\r\nprobability for ages, to refresh hereafter the votaries of genius who\r\nmake their pilgrimage hither, to visit the cradle of one of her greatest\r\nsons. The elm that shaded the boy still flourishes in vigorous leaf, and\r\nmay have an existence beyond its perishable nature. Like\r\n\r\n  'The witch-elm that guards St. Fillan's spring,'\r\n\r\nit may live in story long after leaf, and branch, and root have\r\ndisappeared for ever.\"\r\n\r\nThe interval between the peace of 1763 and the breaking out of the war\r\nof the Revolution was one of excitement and anxiety throughout the\r\nColonies. The great political questions of the day were not only\r\ndiscussed in the towns and cities, but in the villages and hamlets.\r\nCaptain Webster took a deep interest in those discussions. Like so many\r\nof the officers and soldiers of the former war, he obeyed the first call\r\nto arms in the new struggle. He commanded a company, chiefly composed of\r\nhis own townspeople, friends, and kindred, who followed him through the\r\ngreater portion of the war. He was at the battle of White Plains, and\r\nwas at West Point when the treason of Arnold was discovered. He acted as\r\na Major under Stark at Bennington, and contributed his share to the\r\nsuccess of that eventful day.\r\n\r\nIn the last year of the Revolutionary war, on the 18th of January, 1782,\r\nDaniel Webster was born, in the home which his father had established\r\non the outskirts of civilization. If the character and situation of\r\nthe place, and the circumstances under which he passed the first years\r\nof his life, might seem adverse to the early cultivation of his\r\nextraordinary talent, it still cannot be doubted that they possessed\r\ninfluences favorable to elevation and strength of character. The\r\nhardships of an infant settlement and border life, the traditions of\r\na long series of Indian wars, and of two mighty national contests, in\r\nwhich an honored parent had borne his part, the anecdotes of Fort\r\nWilliam Henry, of Quebec, of Bennington, of West Point, of Wolfe and\r\nStark and Washington, the great Iliad and Odyssey of American\r\nIndependence,--this was the fireside entertainment of the long winter\r\nevenings of the secluded village home. Abroad, the uninviting\r\nlandscape, the harsh and craggy outline of the hills broken and relieved\r\nonly by the funereal hemlock and the \"cloud seeking\" pine, the\r\nlowlands traversed in every direction by unbridged streams, the tall,\r\ncharred trunks in the cornfields, that told how stern had been the\r\nstruggle with the boundless woods, and, at the close of the year, the\r\ndismal scene which presents itself in high latitudes in a thinly\r\nsettled region, when\r\n\r\n          \"the snows descend; and, foul and fierce,\r\n  All winter drives along the darkened air\";--\r\n\r\nthese are circumstances to leave an abiding impression on the mind of a\r\nthoughtful child, and induce an early maturity of character.\r\n\r\nMr. March has described an incident of Mr. Webster's earliest youth in a\r\nmanner so graphical, that we are tempted to repeat it in his own\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n  \"In Mr. Webster's earliest youth an occurrence of such a nature took\r\n  place, which affected him deeply at the time, and has dwelt in his\r\n  memory ever since. There was a sudden and extraordinary rise in the\r\n  Merrimack River, in a spring thaw. A deluge of rain for two whole\r\n  days poured down upon the houses. A mass of mingled water and snow\r\n  rushed madly from the hills, inundating the fields far and wide. The\r\n  highways were broken up, and rendered undistinguishable. There was\r\n  no way for neighbors to interchange visits of condolence or\r\n  necessity, save by boats, which came up to the very door-steps of\r\n  the houses.\r\n\r\n  \"Many things of value were swept away, even things of bulk. A large\r\n  barn, full fifty feet by twenty, crowded with hay and grain, sheep,\r\n  chickens, and turkeys, sailed majestically down the river, before\r\n  the eyes of the astonished inhabitants; who, no little frightened,\r\n  got ready to fly to the mountains, or construct another ark.\r\n\r\n  \"The roar of waters, as they rushed over precipices, casting the\r\n  foam and spray far above, the crashing of the forest-trees as the\r\n  storm broke through them, the immense sea everywhere in range of the\r\n  eye, the sublimity, even danger, of the scene, made an indelible\r\n  impression upon the mind of the youthful observer.\r\n\r\n  \"Occurrences and scenes like these excite the imaginative faculty,\r\n  furnish material for proper thought, call into existence new\r\n  emotions, give decision to character, and a purpose to action.\"--pp.\r\n  7, 8.\r\n\r\nIt may well be supposed that Mr. Webster's early opportunities for\r\neducation were very scanty. It is indeed correctly remarked by Mr.\r\nTicknor, in reference to this point, that \"in New England, ever since\r\nthe first free school was established amidst the woods that covered the\r\npeninsula of Boston in 1636, the schoolmaster has been found on the\r\nborder line between savage and civilized life, often indeed with an axe\r\nto open his own path, but always looked up to with respect, and always\r\ncarrying with him a valuable and preponderating influence.\" Still,\r\nhowever, compared with any thing that would be called a good school in\r\nthis region and at the present time, the schools which existed on the\r\nfrontier sixty years ago were sadly defective. Many of our district\r\nschools even now are below their reputation. The Swedish Chancellor's\r\nexclamation of wonder at the little wisdom with which the world is\r\ngoverned, might well be repeated at the little learning and skill with\r\nwhich the scholastic world in too many parts of our country is still\r\ntaught. In Mr. Webster's boyhood it was much worse. Something that was\r\ncalled a school was kept for two or three months in the winter,\r\nfrequently by an itinerant, too often a pretender, claiming only to\r\nteach a little reading, writing, and ciphering, and wholly incompetent\r\nto give any valuable assistance to a clever youth in learning either.\r\n\r\nSuch as the village school was, Mr. Webster enjoyed its advantages, if\r\nthey could be called by that name. It was, however, of a migratory\r\ncharacter. When it was near his father's residence it was easy to\r\nattend; but it was sometimes in a distant part of the town, and\r\nsometimes in another town. While he was quite young, he was daily sent\r\ntwo miles and a half or three miles to school in mid-winter and on\r\nfoot. If the school-house lay in the same direction with the miller or\r\nthe blacksmith, an occasional ride might be hoped for. If the school was\r\nremoved to a still greater distance, he was boarded at a neighbor's.\r\nPoor as these opportunities of education were, they were bestowed on Mr.\r\nWebster more liberally than on his brothers. He showed a greater\r\neagerness for learning; and he was thought of too frail a constitution\r\nfor any robust pursuit. An older half-brother good-humoredly said, that\r\n\"Dan was sent to school that he might get to know as much as the other\r\nboys.\" It is probable that the best part of his education was derived\r\nfrom the judicious and experienced father, and the strong-minded,\r\naffectionate, and ambitious mother.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster's first master was Thomas Chase. He could read tolerably\r\nwell, and wrote a fair hand; but spelling was not his _forte_. His\r\nsecond master was James Tappan, now living at an advanced age in\r\nGloucester, Massachusetts. His qualifications as a teacher far exceeded\r\nthose of Master Chase. The worthy veteran, now dignified with the title\r\nof Colonel, feels a pride, it may well be supposed, in the fame of his\r\nquondam pupil. He lately addressed a letter to him, recounting some of\r\nthe incidents of his own life since he taught school at Salisbury. This\r\nunexpected communication from his aged teacher drew from Mr. Webster the\r\nfollowing answer, in which a handsome gratuity was inclosed, more,\r\nprobably, than the old gentleman ever received for a winter's teaching\r\nat \"New Salisbury.\"[1]\r\n\r\n  \"_Washington, February 26, 1851._\r\n\r\n  \"MASTER TAPPAN,--I thank you for your letter, and am rejoiced to\r\n  know that you are among the living. I remember you perfectly well as\r\n  a teacher of my infant years. I suppose my mother must have taught\r\n  me to read very early, as I have never been able to recollect the\r\n  time when I could not read the Bible. I think Master Chase was my\r\n  earliest schoolmaster, probably when I was three or four years old.\r\n  Then came Master Tappan. You boarded at our house, and sometimes, I\r\n  think, in the family of Mr. Benjamin Sanborn, our neighbor, the lame\r\n  man. Most of those whom you knew in 'New Salisbury' have gone to\r\n  their graves. Mr. John Sanborn, the son of Benjamin, is yet living,\r\n  and is about your age. Mr. John Colby, who married my oldest\r\n  sister, Susannah, is also living. On the 'North Road' is Mr.\r\n  Benjamin Hunton, and on the 'South Road' is Mr. Benjamin Pettengil.\r\n  I think of none else among the living whom you would probably\r\n  remember.\r\n\r\n  \"You have indeed lived a checkered life. I hope you have been able\r\n  to bear prosperity with meekness, and adversity with patience. These\r\n  things are all ordered for us far better than we could order them\r\n  for ourselves. We may pray for our daily bread; we may pray for the\r\n  forgiveness of sins; we may pray to be kept from temptation, and\r\n  that the kingdom of God may come, in us, and in all men, and his\r\n  will everywhere be done. Beyond this, we hardly know for what good\r\n  to supplicate the Divine Mercy. Our Heavenly Father knoweth what we\r\n  have need of better than we know ourselves, and we are sure that his\r\n  eye and his loving-kindness are upon us and around us every moment.\r\n\r\n  \"I thank you again my good old schoolmaster, for your kind letter,\r\n  which has awakened many sleeping recollections; and, with all good\r\n  wishes, I remain your friend and pupil,\r\n\r\n  \"DANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n  To \"MR. JAMES TAPPAN.\"\r\n\r\nHe derived, also, no small benefit from the little social library,\r\nwhich, chiefly by the exertions of Mr. Thompson (the intelligent lawyer\r\nof the place), the clergyman, and Mr. Webster's father, had been founded\r\nin Salisbury. The attention of the people of New Hampshire had been\r\ncalled to this mode of promoting general and popular education by Dr.\r\nBelknap. In the patriotic address to the people of New Hampshire, at the\r\nclose of his excellent History, he says:--\r\n\r\n  \"This (the establishment of social libraries) is the easiest, the\r\n  cheapest, and the most effectual mode of diffusing knowledge among\r\n  the people. For the sum of six or eight dollars at once, and a small\r\n  annual payment besides, a man may be supplied with the means of\r\n  literary improvement during his life, and his children may inherit\r\n  the blessing.\"[2]\r\n\r\nFrom the village library at Salisbury, founded on recommendations like\r\nthese, Mr. Webster was able to obtain a moderate supply of good reading.\r\nIt is quite worth noticing, that his attention, like that of Franklin,\r\nwas in early boyhood attracted to the Spectator. Franklin, as is well\r\nknown, studiously formed his style on that of Addison;--and a\r\nconsiderable resemblance may be traced between them. There is no such\r\nresemblance between Mr. Webster's style and that of Addison, unless it\r\nbe the negative merit of freedom from balanced sentences, hard words,\r\nand inversions. It may, no doubt, have been partly owing to his early\r\nfamiliarity with the Spectator, that he escaped in youth from the\r\nturgidity and pomp of the Johnsonian school, and grew up to the mastery\r\nof that direct and forcible, but not harsh and affected sententiousness,\r\nthat masculine simplicity, with which his speeches and writings are so\r\nstrongly marked.\r\n\r\nThe year before Mr. Webster was born was rendered memorable in New\r\nHampshire by the foundation of the Academy at Exeter, through the\r\nmunificence of the Honorable John Phillips. His original endowment is\r\nestimated by Dr. Belknap at nearly ten thousand pounds, which, in the\r\ncomparative scarcity of money in 1781, cannot be considered as less than\r\nthree times that amount at the present day. Few events are more likely\r\nto be regarded as eras in the history of that State. In the year 1788,\r\nDr. Benjamin Abbot, soon afterwards its principal, became connected with\r\nthe Academy as an instructor, and from that time it assumed the rank\r\nwhich it still maintains among the schools of the country. To this\r\nAcademy Mr. Webster was taken by his father in May, 1796. He enjoyed the\r\nadvantage of only a few months' instruction in this excellent school;\r\nbut, short as the period was, his mind appears to have received an\r\nimpulse of a most genial and quickening character. Nothing could be more\r\ngraceful or honorable to both parties than the tribute paid by Mr.\r\nWebster to his ancient instructor, at the festival at Exeter, in 1838,\r\nin honor of Dr. Abbot's jubilee. While at the Academy, his studies were\r\naided and his efforts encouraged by a pupil younger than himself, but\r\nwho, having enjoyed better advantages of education in boyhood, was now\r\nin the senior class at Exeter, the early celebrated and lamented Joseph\r\nStevens Buckminster. The following anecdote from Mr. March's work will\r\nnot be thought out of place in this connection:--\r\n\r\n  \"It may appear somewhat singular that the greatest orator of modern\r\n  times should have evinced in his boyhood the strongest antipathy to\r\n  public declamation. This fact, however, is established by his own\r\n  words, which have recently appeared in print. 'I believe,' says Mr.\r\n  Webster, 'I made tolerable progress in most branches which I\r\n  attended to while in this school; but there was one thing I could\r\n  not do. I could not make a declamation. I could not speak before the\r\n  school. The kind and excellent Buckminster sought especially to\r\n  persuade me to perform the exercise of declamation, like other boys,\r\n  but I could not do it. Many a piece did I commit to memory, and\r\n  recite and rehearse in my own room, over and over again; yet when\r\n  the day came, when the school collected to hear declamations, when\r\n  my name was called, and I saw all eyes turned to my seat, I could\r\n  not raise myself from it. Sometimes the instructors frowned,\r\n  sometimes they smiled. Mr. Buckminster always pressed and entreated,\r\n  most winningly, that I would venture. But I never could command\r\n  sufficient resolution.' Such diffidence of its own powers may be\r\n  natural to genius, nervously fearful of being unable to reach that\r\n  ideal which it proposes as the only full consummation of its wishes.\r\n  It is fortunate, however, for the age, fortunate for all ages, that\r\n  Mr. Webster by determined will and frequent trial overcame this\r\n  moral incapacity, as his great prototype, the Grecian orator,\r\n  subdued his physical defect.\"--pp. 12, 13.\r\n\r\nThe effect produced, even at that early period of Mr. Webster's life, on\r\nthe mind of a close observer of his mental powers, is strikingly\r\nillustrated by the following anecdote. Mr. Nicholas Emery, afterwards a\r\ndistinguished lawyer and judge, and now living in Portland, was\r\ntemporarily employed, at that time, as an usher in the Academy. On\r\nentering the Academy, Mr. Webster was placed in the lowest class, which\r\nconsisted of half a dozen boys, of no remarkable brightness of\r\nintellect. Mr. Emery was the instructor of this class, among others. At\r\nthe end of a month, after morning recitations, \"Webster,\" said Mr.\r\nEmery, \"you will pass into the other room and join a higher class\"; and\r\nadded, \"Boys, you will take your final leave of Webster, you will never\r\nsee him again.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a few months well spent at Exeter, Mr. Webster returned home, and\r\nin February, 1797, was placed by his father under the Rev. Samuel Wood,\r\nthe minister of the neighboring town of Boscawen. He lived in Mr. Wood's\r\nfamily, and for board and instruction the entire charge was one dollar\r\nper week.\r\n\r\nOn their way to Mr. Wood's, Mr. Webster's father first opened to his\r\nson, now fifteen years old, the design of sending him to college, the\r\nthought of which had never before entered his mind. The advantages of a\r\ncollege education were a privilege to which he had never aspired in\r\nhis most ambitious dreams. \"I remember,\" says Mr. Webster, in an\r\nautobiographical memorandum of his boyhood, \"the very hill which we\r\nwere ascending, through deep snows, in a New England sleigh, when my\r\nfather made known this purpose to me. I could not speak. How could he,\r\nI thought, with so large a family and in such narrow circumstances,\r\nthink of incurring so great an expense for me. A warm glow ran all\r\nover me, and I laid my head on my father's shoulder and wept.\"\r\n\r\nIn truth, a college education was a far different affair fifty years ago\r\nfrom what it has since become, by the multiplication of collegiate\r\ninstitutions, and the establishment of public funds in aid of those who\r\nneed assistance. It constituted a person at once a member of an\r\nintellectual aristocracy. In many cases it really conferred\r\nqualifications, and in all was supposed to do so, without which\r\nprofessional and public life could not be entered upon with any hope of\r\nsuccess. In New England, at that time, it was not a common occurrence\r\nthat any one attained a respectable position in either of the\r\nprofessions without this advantage. In selecting the member of the\r\nfamily who should enjoy this privilege, the choice not unfrequently fell\r\nupon the son whose slender frame and early indications of disease\r\nunfitted him for the laborious life of our New England yeomanry.\r\n\r\nFrom February till August, 1797, Mr. Webster remained under the\r\ninstruction of Mr. Wood, at Boscawen, and completed his preparation for\r\ncollege. It is hardly necessary to say, that the preparation was\r\nimperfect. There is probably no period in the history of the country at\r\nwhich the standard of classical literature stood lower than it did at\r\nthe close of the last century. The knowledge of Greek and Latin brought\r\nby our forefathers from England had almost run out in the lapse of\r\nnearly two centuries, and the signal revival which has taken place\r\nwithin the last thirty years had not yet begun. Still, however, when we\r\nhear of a youth of fifteen preparing himself for college by a year's\r\nstudy of Greek and Latin, we must recollect that the attainments which\r\nmay be made in that time by a young man of distinguished talent, at the\r\nperiod of life when the faculties develop themselves with the greatest\r\nenergy, studying night and day, summer and winter, under the master\r\ninfluence of hope, ambition, and necessity, are not to be measured by\r\nthe tardy progress of the thoughtless or languid children of prosperity,\r\nsent to school from the time they are able to go alone, and carried\r\nalong by routine and discipline from year to year, in the majority of\r\ncases without strong personal motives to diligence. Besides this, it is\r\nto be considered that the studies which occupy this usually prolonged\r\nnovitiate are those which are required for the acquisition of\r\ngrammatical and metrical niceties, the elegancies and the luxuries of\r\nscholarship. Short as was his period of preparation, it enabled Mr.\r\nWebster to lay the foundation of a knowledge of the classical writers,\r\nespecially the Latin, which was greatly increased in college, and which\r\nhas been kept up by constant recurrence to the great models of\r\nantiquity, during the busiest periods of active life. The happiness of\r\nMr. Webster's occasional citations from the Latin classics is a striking\r\nfeature of his oratory.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster entered college in 1797, and passed the four academic years\r\nin assiduous study. He was not only distinguished for his attention to\r\nthe prescribed studies, but devoted himself to general reading,\r\nespecially to English history and literature. He took part in the\r\npublication of a little weekly newspaper, furnishing selections from\r\nbooks and magazines, with an occasional article from his own pen. He\r\ndelivered addresses, also, before the college societies, some of which\r\nwere published. The winter vacations brought no relaxation. Like those\r\nof so many of the meritorious students at our places of education, they\r\nwere employed in teaching school, for the purpose of eking out his own\r\nfrugal means and aiding his brother to prepare himself for college. The\r\nattachment between the two brothers was of the most affectionate kind,\r\nand it was by the persuasion of Daniel that the father had been induced\r\nto extend to Ezekiel also the benefits of a college education.\r\n\r\nThe genial and companionable spirit of Mr. Webster is still remembered\r\nby his classmates, and by the close of his first college year he had\r\ngiven proof of powers and aspirations which placed him far above rivalry\r\namong his associates. \"It is known,\" says Mr. Ticknor, \"in many ways,\r\nthat, by those who were acquainted with him at this period of life, he\r\nwas already regarded as a marked man, and that to the more sagacious of\r\nthem the honors of his subsequent career have not been unexpected.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Webster completed his college course in August, 1801, and\r\nimmediately entered the office of Mr. Thompson, the next-door neighbor\r\nof his father, as a student of law. Mr. Thompson was a gentleman of\r\neducation and intelligence, and, at a later period, a respectable\r\nmember, successively, of the House of Representatives and Senate of the\r\nUnited States. He maintained a high character till his death. Mr.\r\nWebster remained in his office as a student till, in the words of Mr.\r\nMarch, \"he felt it necessary to go somewhere and do something to earn a\r\nlittle money.\" In this emergency, application was made to him to take\r\ncharge of an academy at Fryeburg in Maine, upon a salary of about one\r\ndollar _per diem_, being what is now paid for the coarsest kind of\r\nunskilled manual labor. As he was able, besides, to earn enough to pay\r\nfor his board and to defray his other expenses by acting as assistant to\r\nthe register of deeds for the county, his salary was all saved,--a fund\r\nfor his own professional education and to help his brother through\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster's son and one of his friends have lately visited Fryeburg\r\nand examined these records of deeds. They are still preserved in two\r\nhuge folio volumes, in Mr. Webster's handwriting, exciting wonder how so\r\nmuch work could be done in the evening, after days of close confinement\r\nto the business of the school. They looked also at the records of the\r\ntrustees of the academy and found in them a most respectful and\r\naffectionate vote of thanks and good-will to Mr. Webster when he took\r\nleave of the employment.[3]\r\n\r\nThese humble details need no apology. They relate to trials, hardships,\r\nand efforts which constitute no small part of the discipline by which a\r\ngreat character is formed. During his residence at Fryeburg, Mr. Webster\r\nborrowed (he was too poor to buy) Blackstone's Commentaries, and read\r\nthem for the first time. \"Among other mental exercises,\" says Mr. March,\r\n\"he committed to memory Mr. Ames's celebrated speech on the British\r\ntreaty.\" In after life he has been heard to say, that few things moved\r\nhim more than the perusal and reperusal of this celebrated speech.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1802, Mr. Webster returned to Salisbury, and resumed his\r\nstudies under Mr. Thompson, in whose office he remained for eighteen\r\nmonths. Mr. Thompson, though, as we have said, a person of excellent\r\ncharacter and a good lawyer, yet seems not to have kept pace in his\r\nprofession with the progress of improvement. Although Blackstone's\r\nCommentaries had been known in this country for a full generation, Mr.\r\nThompson still directed the reading of his pupils on the principle of\r\nthe hardest book first. Coke's Littleton was still the work with which\r\nhis students were broken into the study of the profession. Mr. Webster\r\nhas condemned this practice. \"A boy of twenty,\" says he, \"with no\r\nprevious knowledge of such subjects, cannot understand Coke. It is folly\r\nto set him upon such an author. There are propositions in Coke so\r\nabstract, and distinctions so nice, and doctrines embracing so many\r\ndistinctions and qualifications, that it requires an effort not only of\r\na mature mind, but of a mind both strong and mature, to understand him.\r\nWhy disgust and discourage a young man by telling him he must break into\r\nhis profession through such a wall as this?\" Acting upon these views,\r\neven in his youth, Mr. Webster gave his attention to more intelligible\r\nauthors, and to titles of law of greater importance in this country than\r\nthe curious learning of tenures, many of which are antiquated, even in\r\nEngland. He also gave a good deal of time to general reading, and\r\nespecially the study of the Latin classics, English history, and the\r\nvolumes of Shakespeare. In order to obtain a wider compass of knowledge,\r\nand to learn something of the language not to be gained from the\r\nclassics, he read through attentively Puffendorff's Latin History of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1804, he took up his residence in Boston. Before entering upon\r\nthe practice of his profession, he enjoyed the advantage of pursuing his\r\nlegal studies for six or eight months in the office of the Hon.\r\nChristopher Gore. This was a fortunate event for Mr. Webster. Mr. Gore,\r\nafterwards Governor of Massachusetts, was a lawyer of eminence, a\r\nstatesman and a civilian, a gentleman of the old school of manners, and\r\na rare example of distinguished intellectual qualities, united with\r\npractical good sense and judgment. He had passed several years in\r\nEngland as a commissioner, under Jay's treaty, for liquidating the\r\nclaims of citizens of the United States for seizures by British cruisers\r\nin the early wars of the French Revolution. His library, amply\r\nfurnished with works of professional and general literature, his large\r\nexperience of men and things at home and abroad, and his uncommon\r\namenity of temper, combined to make the period passed by Mr. Webster in\r\nhis office one of the pleasantest in his life. These advantages, it\r\nhardly need be said, were not thrown away. He diligently attended the\r\nsessions of the courts and reported their decisions. He read with care\r\nthe leading elementary works of the common and municipal law, with the\r\nbest authors on the law of nations, some of them for a second and third\r\ntime; diversifying these professional studies with a great amount and\r\nvariety of general reading. His chief study, however, was the common\r\nlaw, and more especially that part of it which relates to the now\r\nunfashionable science of special pleading. He regarded this, not only as\r\na most refined and ingenious, but a highly instructive and useful branch\r\nof the law. Besides mastering all that could be derived from more\r\nobvious sources, he waded through Saunders's Reports in the original\r\nedition, and abstracted and translated into English from the Latin and\r\nNorman French all the pleadings contained in the two folio volumes. This\r\nmanuscript still remains.\r\n\r\nJust as he was about to be admitted to practise in the Suffolk Court of\r\nCommon Pleas in Massachusetts, an incident occurred which came near\r\naffecting his career for life. The place of clerk in the Court of Common\r\nPleas for the county of Hillsborough, in New Hampshire, became vacant.\r\nOf this court Mr. Webster's father had been made one of the judges, in\r\nconformity with a very common practice at that time, of placing on the\r\nside bench of the lower courts men of intelligence and respectability,\r\nthough not lawyers. From regard to Judge Webster, the vacant clerkship\r\nwas offered by his colleagues to his son. It was what the father had for\r\nsome time looked forward to and desired. The fees of the office were\r\nabout fifteen hundred dollars _per annum_, which in those days and in\r\nthat region was not so much a competence as a fortune. Mr. Webster\r\nhimself was disposed to accept the office. It promised an immediate\r\nprovision in lieu of a distant and doubtful prospect. It enabled him at\r\nonce to bring comfort into his father's family, while to refuse it was\r\nto condemn himself and them to an uncertain and probably harassing\r\nfuture. He was willing to sacrifice his hopes of professional eminence\r\nto the welfare of those whom he held most dear. But the earnest\r\ndissuasions of Mr. Gore, who saw in this step the certain postponement,\r\nperhaps the final defeat, of all hopes of professional advancement,\r\nprevented his accepting the office. His aged father was, in a personal\r\ninterview with his son, if not reconciled to the refusal, at least\r\ninduced to bury his regrets in his own bosom. The subject was never\r\nmentioned by him again. In the spring of the same year (1805), Mr.\r\nWebster was admitted to the practice of the law in the Court of Common\r\nPleas for Suffolk county, Boston. According to the custom of that day,\r\nMr. Gore accompanied the motion for his admission with a brief speech in\r\nrecommendation of the candidate. The remarks of Mr. Gore on this\r\noccasion are well remembered by those present. He dwelt with emphasis on\r\nthe remarkable attainments and uncommon promise of his pupil, and closed\r\nwith a prediction of his future eminence.\r\n\r\nImmediately on his admission to the bar, Mr. Webster went to Amherst, in\r\nNew Hampshire, where his father's court was in session; from that place\r\nhe went home with his father. He had intended to establish himself at\r\nPortsmouth, which, as the largest town and the seat of the foreign\r\ncommerce of the State, opened the widest field for practice. But filial\r\nduty kept him nearer home. His father was now infirm from the advance of\r\nyears, and had no other son at home. Under these circumstances Mr.\r\nWebster opened an office at Boscawen, not far from his father's\r\nresidence, and commenced the practice of the law in this retired spot.\r\nJudge Webster lived but a year after his son's entrance upon the\r\npractice of his profession; long enough, however, to hear his first\r\nargument in court, and to be gratified with the confident predictions of\r\nhis future success.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1807, Mr. Webster was admitted as an attorney and counsellor of\r\nthe Superior Court in New Hampshire, and in September of that year,\r\nrelinquishing his office in Boscawen to his brother Ezekiel, he removed\r\nto Portsmouth, in conformity with his original intention. Here he\r\nremained in the practice of his profession for nine successive years.\r\nThey were years of assiduous labor, and of unremitted devotion to the\r\nstudy and practice of the law. He was associated with several persons\r\nof great eminence, citizens of New Hampshire or of Massachusetts\r\noccasionally practising at the Portsmouth bar. Among the latter were\r\nSamuel Dexter and Joseph Story; of the residents of New Hampshire,\r\nJeremiah Mason was the most distinguished. Often opposed to each other\r\nas lawyers, a strong personal friendship grew up between them, which\r\nended only with the death of Mr. Mason. Mr. Webster's eulogy on Mr.\r\nMason will be found in one of the volumes of this collection, and will\r\ndescend to posterity an enduring monument of both. Had a more active\r\ntemperament led Mr. Mason to embark earlier and continue longer in\r\npublic life, he would have achieved a distinction shared by few of his\r\ncontemporaries. Mr. Webster, in the lapse of time, was called to perform\r\nthe same melancholy office for Judge Story.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of Mr. Webster's practice of the law in New\r\nHampshire, Jeremiah Smith was Chief Justice of the State, a learned and\r\nexcellent judge, whose biography has been written by the Rev. John H.\r\nMorison, and will well repay perusal. Judge Smith was an early and warm\r\nfriend of Judge Webster, and this friendship descended to the son, and\r\nglowed in his breast with fervor till he went to his grave.\r\n\r\nAlthough dividing with Mr. Mason the best of the business of Portsmouth,\r\nand indeed of all the eastern portion of the State, Mr. Webster's\r\npractice was mostly on the circuit. He followed the Superior Court\r\nthrough the principal counties of the State, and was retained in nearly\r\nevery important cause. It is mentioned by Mr. March, as a somewhat\r\nsingular fact in his professional life, that, with the exception of the\r\noccasions on which he has been associated with the Attorney-General of\r\nthe United States for the time being, he has hardly appeared ten times\r\nas junior counsel. Within the sphere in which he was placed, he may be\r\nsaid to have risen at once to the head of his profession; not, however,\r\nlike Erskine and some other celebrated British lawyers, by one and the\r\nsame bound, at once to fame and fortune. The American bar holds forth no\r\nsuch golden prizes, certainly not in the smaller States. Mr. Webster's\r\npractice in New Hampshire, though probably as good as that of any of his\r\ncontemporaries, was never lucrative. Clients were not very rich, nor the\r\nconcerns litigated such as would carry heavy fees. Although exclusively\r\ndevoted to his profession, it afforded him no more than a bare\r\nlivelihood.\r\n\r\nBut the time for which he practised at the New Hampshire bar was\r\nprobably not lost with reference to his future professional and\r\npolitical eminence. His own standard of legal attainment was high. He\r\nwas associated with professional brethren fully competent to put his\r\npowers to their best proof, and to prevent him from settling down in\r\nearly life into an easy routine of ordinary professional practice. It\r\nwas no disadvantage, under these circumstances, (except in reference to\r\nimmediate pecuniary benefit,) to enjoy some portion of that leisure for\r\ngeneral reading, which is almost wholly denied to the lawyer of\r\ncommanding talents, who steps immediately into full practice in a large\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n    [1] Fifty dollars. The knowledge of this fact is derived from the\r\n        \"Gloucester News,\" to which it was no doubt communicated by\r\n        Master Tappan.\r\n\r\n    [2] Belknap's History of New Hampshire, Vol. III. p. 328.\r\n\r\n    [3] The old school-house was burned down many years ago.

In fact, at the time to which the preceding narrative refers,\r\nthe politics of the country were in such a state, that there was scarce\r\nany course which could be pursued with entire satisfaction by a\r\npatriotic young man sagacious enough to penetrate behind mere party\r\nnames, and to view public questions in their true light. Party spirit\r\nran high; errors had been committed by ardent men on both sides; and\r\nextreme opinions had been advanced on most questions, which no wise and\r\nwell-informed person at the present day would probably be willing to\r\nespouse. The United States, although not actually drawn to any great\r\ndepth into the vortex of the French Revolution, were powerfully affected\r\nby it. The deadly struggle of the two great European belligerents, in\r\nwhich the neutral rights of this country were grossly violated by both,\r\ngave a complexion to our domestic politics. A change of administration,\r\nmainly resulting from difference of opinion in respect to our foreign\r\nrelations, had taken place in 1801. If we may consider President\r\nJefferson's inaugural address as the indication of the principles on\r\nwhich he intended to conduct his administration, it was his purpose to\r\ntake a new departure, and to disregard the former party divisions. \"We\r\nhave,\" said he, in that eloquent state paper, \"called by different names\r\nbrethren of the same principle. We are all republicans, we are all\r\nfederalists.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time these significant expressions were uttered, Mr. Webster, at\r\nthe age of nineteen, was just leaving college and preparing to embark on\r\nthe voyage of life. A sentiment so liberal was not only in accordance\r\nwith the generous temper of youth, but highly congenial with the spirit\r\nof enlarged patriotism which has ever guided his public course. There is\r\ncertainly no individual who has filled a prominent place in our\r\npolitical history who has shown himself more devoted to principle and\r\nless to party. While no man has clung with greater tenacity to the\r\nfriendships which spring from agreement in political opinion (the _idem\r\nsentire de republica_), no man has been less disposed to find in these\r\nassociations an instrument of monopoly or exclusion in favor of\r\nindividuals, interests, or sections of the country.\r\n\r\nBut however catholic may have been the intentions and wishes of Mr.\r\nJefferson, events both at home and abroad were too strong for him, and\r\ndefeated that policy of blending the great parties into one, which has\r\nalways been a favorite, perhaps we must add, a visionary project, with\r\nstatesmen of elevated and generous characters. The aggressions of the\r\nbelligerents on our neutral commerce still continued, and, by the joint\r\neffect of the Berlin and Milan Decrees and the Orders in Council, it was\r\nall but swept from the ocean. In this state of things two courses were\r\nopen to the United States, as a growing neutral power: one, that of\r\nprompt resistance to the aggressive policy of the belligerents; the\r\nother, that which was called \"the restrictive system,\" which consisted\r\nin an embargo on our own vessels, with a view to withdraw them from the\r\ngrasp of foreign cruisers, and in laws inhibiting commercial intercourse\r\nwith England and France. There was a division of opinion in the cabinet\r\nof Mr. Jefferson and in the country at large. The latter policy was\r\nfinally adopted. It fell in with the general views of Mr. Jefferson\r\nagainst committing the country to the risks of foreign war. His\r\nadministration was also strongly pledged to retrenchment and economy, in\r\nthe pursuit of which a portion of our little navy had been brought to\r\nthe hammer, and a species of shore defence substituted, which can now be\r\nthought of only with mortification and astonishment.\r\n\r\nAlthough the discipline of party was sufficiently strong to cause this\r\nsystem of measures to be adopted and pursued for years, it was never\r\ncordially approved by the people of the United States of any party.\r\nLeading Republicans both at the South and at the North denounced it.\r\nWith Mr. Jefferson's retirement from office it fell rapidly into\r\ndisrepute. It continued, however, to form the basis of our party\r\ndivisions till the war of 1812. In these divisions, as has been\r\nintimated, both parties were in a false position; the one supporting and\r\nforcing upon the country a system of measures not cordially approved,\r\neven by themselves; the other, a powerless minority, zealously opposing\r\nthose measures, but liable for that reason to be thought backward in\r\nasserting the neutral rights of the country. A few men of well-balanced\r\nminds, true patriotism, and sound statesmanship, in all sections of the\r\ncountry, were able to unite fidelity to their party associations with a\r\ncomprehensive view to the good of the country. Among these, mature\r\nbeyond his years, was Mr. Webster. As early as 1806 he had, in a public\r\noration, presented an impartial view of the foreign relations of the\r\ncountry in reference to both belligerents, of the importance of our\r\ncommercial interests and the duty of protecting them. \"Nothing is\r\nplainer,\" said he, \"than this: if we will have commerce, we must protect\r\nit. This country is commercial as well as agricultural. Indissoluble\r\nbonds connect him who ploughs the land with him who ploughs the sea.\r\nNature has placed us in a situation favorable to commercial pursuits,\r\nand no government can alter the destination. Habits confirmed by two\r\ncenturies are not to be changed. An immense portion of our property is\r\non the waves. Sixty or eighty thousand of our most useful citizens are\r\nthere, and are entitled to such protection from the government as their\r\ncase requires.\"\r\n\r\nAt length the foreign belligerents themselves perceived the folly and\r\ninjustice of their measures. In the strife which should inflict the\r\ngreatest injury on the other, they had paralyzed the commerce of the\r\nworld and embittered the minds of all the neutral powers. The Berlin and\r\nMilan Decrees were revoked, but in a manner so unsatisfactory as in a\r\ngreat degree to impair the pacific tendency of the measure. The Orders\r\nin Council were also rescinded in the summer of 1812. War, however,\r\njustly provoked by each and both of the parties, had meantime been\r\ndeclared by Congress against England, and active hostilities had been\r\ncommenced on the frontier. At the elections next ensuing, Mr. Webster\r\nwas brought forward as a candidate for Congress of the Federal party of\r\nthat day, and, having been chosen in the month of November, 1812, he\r\ntook his seat at the first session of the Thirteenth Congress, which was\r\nan extra session called in May, 1813. Although his course of life\r\nhitherto had been in what may be called a provincial sphere, and he had\r\nnever been a member even of the legislature of his native State, a\r\npresentiment of his ability seems to have gone before him to Washington.\r\nHe was, in the organization of the House, placed by Mr. Clay, its\r\nSpeaker, upon the Committee of Foreign Affairs, a select committee at\r\nthat time, and of necessity the leading committee in a state of war.\r\n\r\nThere were many men of uncommon ability in the Thirteenth Congress.\r\nRarely has so much talent been found at any one time in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. It contained Clay, Calhoun, Lowndes, Pickering, Gaston,\r\nForsyth, in the front rank; Macon, Benson, J. W. Taylor, Oakley,\r\nGrundy, Grosvenor, W. R. King, Kent of Maryland, C. J. Ingersoll of\r\nPennsylvania, Pitkin of Connecticut, and others of scarcely inferior\r\nnote. Although among the youngest and least experienced members of the\r\nbody, Mr. Webster rose, from the first, to a position of undisputed\r\nequality with the most distinguished. The times were critical. The\r\nimmediate business to be attended to was the financial and military\r\nconduct of the war, a subject of difficulty and importance. The\r\nposition of Mr. Webster was not such as to require or permit him to take\r\na lead; but it was his steady aim, without the sacrifice of his\r\nprinciples, to pursue such a course as would tend most effectually to\r\nextricate the country from the embarrassments of her present position,\r\nand to lead to peace upon honorable terms.\r\n\r\nAs the repeal of the Orders in Council was nearly simultaneous with the\r\ndeclaration of war, the delay of a few weeks might have led to an\r\namicable adjustment. Whatever regret on the score of humanity this\r\ncircumstance may now inspire, the war must be looked upon, in reviewing\r\nthe past, as a great chapter in the progress of the country, which could\r\nnot be passed over. When we reflect on the influence of the conflict, in\r\nits general results, upon the national character; its importance as a\r\ndemonstration to the belligerent powers of the world that the rights of\r\nneutrals must be respected; and more especially, when we consider the\r\nposition among the nations of the earth which the United States have\r\nbeen enabled to take, in consequence of the capacity for naval\r\nachievement which the war displayed, we shall readily acknowledge it to\r\nbe a part of that great training, by which the country was prepared to\r\ntake the station which she now occupies.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster was not a member of Congress when war was declared, nor in\r\nany other public station. He was too deeply read in the law of nations,\r\nand regarded that august code with too much respect, not to contemplate\r\nwith indignation its infraction by both the belligerents. With respect\r\nto the Orders in Council, the highest judicial magistrate in England\r\n(Lord Chief Justice Campbell) has lately admitted that they were\r\ncontrary to the law of nations.[4] As little doubt can exist that the\r\nFrench decrees were equally at variance with the public law. But however\r\nstrong his convictions of this truth, Mr. Webster's sagacity and\r\npractical sense pointed out the inadequacy, and what may be called the\r\npolitical irrelevancy, of the restrictive system, as a measure of\r\ndefence or retaliation. He could not but feel that it was a policy which\r\ntended at once to cripple the national resources, and abase the public\r\nsentiment, with an effect upon the foreign powers doubtful and at best\r\nindirect. In the state of the military resources of the country at that\r\ntime, he discerned, in common with many independent men of all parties,\r\nthat less was to be hoped from the attempted conquest of foreign\r\nterritory, than from a gallant assault upon the fancied supremacy of the\r\nenemy at sea. It is unnecessary to state, that the whole course of the\r\nwar confirmed the justice of these views. They furnish the key to Mr.\r\nWebster's course in the Thirteenth Congress.\r\n\r\nEarly in the session, he moved a series of resolutions of inquiry,\r\nrelative to the repeal of the Berlin and Milan Decrees. The object of\r\nthese resolutions was to elicit a communication on this subject from the\r\nexecutive, which would unfold the proximate causes of the war, as far as\r\nthey were to be sought in those famous Decrees, and in the Orders in\r\nCouncil. On the 10th of June, 1813, Mr. Webster delivered his maiden\r\nspeech on these resolutions. No full report of this speech has been\r\npreserved. It is known only from extremely imperfect sketches, contained\r\nin the contemporaneous newspaper accounts of the proceedings of\r\nCongress, from the recollection of those who heard it, and from general\r\ntradition. It was a calm and statesmanlike exposition of the objects of\r\nthe resolutions; and was listened to with profound attention by the\r\nHouse. It was marked by all the characteristics of Mr. Webster's\r\nmaturest parliamentary efforts,--moderation of tone, precision of\r\nstatement, force of reasoning, absence of ambitious rhetoric and\r\nhigh-flown language, occasional bursts of true eloquence, and, pervading\r\nthe whole, a genuine and fervid patriotism. We have reason to believe\r\nthat its effect upon the House is accurately described in the following\r\nextract from Mr. March's work.\r\n\r\n  \"The speech took the House by surprise, not so much from its\r\n  eloquence as from the vast amount of historical knowledge and\r\n  illustrative ability displayed in it. How a person, untrained to\r\n  forensic contests and unused to public affairs, could exhibit so\r\n  much parliamentary tact, such nice appreciation of the difficulties\r\n  of a difficult question, and such quiet facility in surmounting\r\n  them, puzzled the mind. The age and inexperience of the speaker had\r\n  prepared the House for no such display, and astonishment for a time\r\n  subdued the expression of its admiration.\r\n\r\n  \"'No member before,' says a person then in the House, 'ever riveted\r\n  the attention of the House so closely, in his first speech. Members\r\n  left their seats, where they could not see the speaker face to face,\r\n  and sat down, or stood on the floor, fronting him. All listened\r\n  attentively and silently, during the whole speech; and when it was\r\n  over, many went up and warmly congratulated the orator; among whom\r\n  were some, not the most niggard of their compliments, who most\r\n  dissented from the views he had expressed.'\r\n\r\n  \"Chief Justice Marshall, writing to a friend some time after this\r\n  speech, says: 'At the time when this speech was delivered, I did not\r\n  know Mr. Webster, but I was so much struck with it, that I did not\r\n  hesitate then to state, that Mr. Webster was a very able man, and\r\n  would become one of the very first statesmen in America, and perhaps\r\n  the very first.'\"--pp. 35, 36.[5]\r\n\r\nThe resolutions moved by Mr. Webster prevailed by a large majority, and\r\ndrew forth from Mr. Monroe, then Secretary of State, an elaborate and\r\ninstructive report upon the subject to which they referred.\r\n\r\nWe have already observed, that, as early as 1806, Mr. Webster had\r\nexpressed himself in favor of the protection of our commerce against the\r\naggressions of both the belligerents. Some years later, before the war\r\nwas declared, but when it was visibly impending, he had put forth some\r\nvigorous articles to the same effect. In an oration delivered in 1812,\r\nhe had said: \"A navy sufficient for the defence of our coasts and\r\nharbors, for the convoy of important branches of our trade, and\r\nsufficient also to give our enemies to understand, when they injure us,\r\nthat they too are vulnerable, and that we have the power of retaliation\r\nas well as of defence, seems to be the plain, necessary, indispensable\r\npolicy of the nation. It is the dictate of nature and common sense, that\r\nmeans of defence shall have relation to the danger.\" In accordance with\r\nthese views, first announced by Mr. Webster a considerable time before\r\nHull, Decatur, and Bainbridge had broken the spell of British naval\r\nsupremacy, he used the following language in his speech on encouraging\r\nenlistments in 1814:--\r\n\r\n  \"The humble aid which it would be in my power to render to measures\r\n  of government shall be given cheerfully, if government will pursue\r\n  measures which I can conscientiously support. If even now, failing\r\n  in an honest and sincere attempt to procure an honorable peace, it\r\n  will return to measures of defence and protection, such as reason\r\n  and common sense and the public opinion all call for, my vote shall\r\n  not be withholden from the means. Give up your futile projects of\r\n  invasion. Extinguish the fires which blaze on your inland frontiers.\r\n  Establish perfect safety and defence there by adequate force. Let\r\n  every man that sleeps on your soil sleep in security. Stop the blood\r\n  that flows from the veins of unarmed yeomanry, and women and\r\n  children. Give to the living time to bury and lament their dead, in\r\n  the quietness of private sorrow. Having performed this work of\r\n  beneficence and mercy on your inland border, turn and look with the\r\n  eye of justice and compassion on your vast population along the\r\n  coast. Unclench the iron grasp of your embargo. Take measures for\r\n  that end before another sun sets upon you. With all the war of the\r\n  enemy on your commerce, if you would cease to make war upon it\r\n  yourselves, you would still have some commerce. That commerce would\r\n  give you some revenue. Apply that revenue to the augmentation of\r\n  your navy. That navy in turn will protect your commerce. Let it no\r\n  longer be said, that not one ship of force, built by your hands\r\n  since the war, yet floats upon the ocean. Turn the current of your\r\n  efforts into the channel which national sentiment has already worn\r\n  broad and deep to receive it. A naval force competent to defend your\r\n  coasts against considerable armaments, to convoy your trade, and\r\n  perhaps raise the blockade of your rivers, is not a chimera. It may\r\n  be realized. If then the war must continue, go to the ocean. If you\r\n  are seriously contending for maritime rights, go to the theatre\r\n  where alone those rights can be defended. Thither every indication\r\n  of your fortune points you. There the united wishes and exertions of\r\n  the nation will go with you. Even our party divisions, acrimonious\r\n  as they are, cease at the water's edge. They are lost in attachment\r\n  to the national character, on the element where that character is\r\n  made respectable. In protecting naval interests by naval means, you\r\n  will arm yourselves with the whole power of national sentiment, and\r\n  may command the whole abundance of the national resources. In time\r\n  you may be able to redress injuries in the place where they may be\r\n  offered; and, if need be, to accompany your own flag throughout the\r\n  world with the protection of your own cannon.\"\r\n\r\nThe principal subjects on which Mr. Webster addressed the House during\r\nthe Thirteenth Congress were his own resolutions, the increase of the\r\nnavy, the repeal of the embargo, and an appeal from the decision of the\r\nchair on a motion for the previous question. His speeches on those\r\nquestions raised him to the front rank of debaters. He manifested upon\r\nhis entrance into public life that variety of knowledge, familiarity\r\nwith the history and traditions of the government, and self-possession\r\non the floor, which in most cases are acquired by time and long\r\nexperience. They gained for him the reputation indicated by the\r\nwell-known remark of Mr. Lowndes, that \"the North had not his equal, nor\r\nthe South his superior.\" It was not the least conspicuous of the\r\nstrongly marked qualities of his character as a public man, disclosed at\r\nthis early period, and uniformly preserved throughout his career, that,\r\nat a time when party spirit went to great lengths, he never permitted\r\nhimself to be infected with its contagion. His opinions were firmly\r\nmaintained and boldly expressed; but without bitterness toward those who\r\ndiffered from him. He cultivated friendly relations on both sides of the\r\nHouse, and gained the personal respect even of those with whom he most\r\ndiffered.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1814, Mr. Webster was reelected to Congress. The treaty\r\nof Ghent, as is well known, was signed in December, 1814, and the\r\nprospect of peace, universally welcomed by the country, opened on\r\nthe Thirteenth Congress toward the close of its third session.\r\nEarlier in the season a project for a Bank of the United States was\r\nintroduced into the House of Representatives on the recommendation of\r\nMr. Dallas, Secretary of the Treasury. The charter of the first\r\nincorporated bank of the United States had expired in 1811. No general\r\ncomplaints of mismanagement or abuse had been raised against this\r\ninstitution; but the opinions entertained by what has been called the\r\n\"Virginia School\" of politicians, against the constitutionality of a\r\nnational bank, prevented the renewal of the charter. The want of\r\nsuch an institution was severely felt in the war of 1812, although it\r\nis probable that the amount of assistance which it could have afforded\r\nthe financial operations of the government was greatly overrated. Be\r\nthis as it may, both the Treasury Department and Congress were now\r\nstrongly disposed to create a bank. Its capital was to consist of\r\nforty-five millions of the public stocks and five millions of specie,\r\nand it was to be under obligation to lend the government thirty\r\nmillions of dollars on demand. To enable it to exist under these\r\nconditions, it was relieved from the necessity of redeeming its notes\r\nin specie. In other words, it was an arrangement for the issue of an\r\nirredeemable paper currency. It was opposed mainly on this ground by\r\nMr. Calhoun, Mr. Webster, Mr. Lowndes, and others of the ablest men on\r\nboth sides of the House, as a project not only unsound in its\r\nprinciples, but sure to increase the derangement of the currency already\r\nexisting. The speech of Mr. Webster against the bill will be found in\r\none of these volumes, and it will be generally admitted to display a\r\nmastery of the somewhat difficult subjects of banking and finance,\r\nrarely to be found in the debates in Congress. The project was\r\nsupported as an administration measure, but the leading members from\r\nSouth Carolina and their friends united with the regular opposition\r\nagainst it, and it was lost by the casting vote of the Speaker, Mr.\r\nCheves. It was revived by reconsideration, on motion of Mr. Webster,\r\nand such amendments introduced that it passed the House by a large\r\nmajority. It was carried through the Senate in this amended form\r\nwith difficulty, but it was negatived by Mr. Madison, being one of\r\nthe two cases in which he exercised the veto power during his eight\r\nyears' administration.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of January of the year 1815, the victory at New Orleans was\r\ngained by General Jackson. No occurrence on land, in the course of the\r\nwar, was of equal immediate interest, or destined to have so abiding an\r\ninfluence on the future. Besides averting the indescribable calamity of\r\nthe sack of a populous and flourishing city, it showed the immense\r\nmilitary power of the volunteer force of the country, when commanded\r\nwith energy and skill. The praises of General Jackson were on every\r\ntongue throughout the land, and Congress responded to the grateful\r\nfeelings of the country. A vote of thanks was unanimously passed by the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nIn the interval between the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Congresses\r\n(March-December, 1815), Mr. Webster was busily engaged at home in the\r\npractice of the law. He had begun at this time to consider the\r\nexpediency of removing his residence to a wider professional field.\r\nThough receiving a full share of the best business of New Hampshire, it\r\nceased to yield an adequate support for his increasing family, and still\r\nmore failed to afford any thing like the just reward of his legal\r\nattainment and labors. The destruction of his house, furniture, library,\r\nand many important manuscript collections, in \"the great fire\" at\r\nPortsmouth, in December, 1813, had entailed upon him the loss of the\r\nentire fruits of his professional industry up to that time, and made it\r\nnecessary for him to look around him for the means of a considerably\r\nincreased income. He hesitated between Albany and Boston; and, in\r\nconsequence of this indecision, the execution of his purpose was for the\r\npresent postponed.\r\n\r\nThe Fourteenth Congress assembled in December, 1815. An order of things\r\nin a great degree new presented itself. After a momentary pause, the\r\ncountry rose with an elastic bound from the pressure of the war. Old\r\nparty dissensions had lost much of their interest. The condition of\r\nEurope had undergone a great change. The power of the French emperor was\r\nannihilated; and with the return of general peace, all occasions for\r\nbelligerent encroachments on neutral rights had ceased. Two thirds of\r\nour domestic feuds had turned on foreign questions, and there was a\r\nspontaneous feeling throughout the country in favor of healing the\r\nwounds which these feuds had inflicted upon its social and political\r\nharmony. Nor was this all. New relations and interests had arisen. The\r\npublic debt had been swelled by the war expenditure to a large amount,\r\nand its interest was to be paid. Domestic manufactures had, in some of\r\nthe States, grown up into importance through the operation of the\r\nrestrictive system and the war, and asked for protection. The West began\r\nto fill up with unexampled rapidity, and required new facilities of\r\ncommunication with the Atlantic coast. The navy had fought itself into\r\nfavor, and the war with Algiers, in 1816, forbade its reduction below\r\nthe recent war establishment. The necessity of a system of coast\r\ndefences had made itself felt. With all these loud calls for increased\r\nexpenditure, the public finances were embarrassed and the currency was\r\nin extreme disorder. In a word, there were new and great wants and\r\ninterests at home and abroad, throwing former topics of dissension into\r\nthe shade, and calling for the highest efforts of statesmanship and a\r\npatriotism embracing the whole country.\r\n\r\nAmong those who responded with the greatest cordiality and promptness to\r\nthe new demand were the distinguished statesmen of the preceding\r\nCongress, and conspicuous among them Clay, Calhoun, Webster, Lowndes,\r\nand Cheves. It will excite some surprise at the present day, in\r\nconsideration of the political history of the last thirty years, to find\r\nhow little difference as to leading measures existed in 1816 between\r\nthese distinguished statesmen. No line of general party difference\r\nseparated the members of the first Congress after the peace. The great\r\nmeasures brought forward were a national bank, internal improvement, and\r\na protective tariff. On these various subjects members divided, not in\r\naccordance with any party organization, but from individual convictions,\r\nsupposed sectional interests, and general public grounds. On the two\r\nfirst-named subjects no systematic difference of views disclosed itself\r\nbetween the great Northern and Southern leaders; on the third alone\r\nthere was diversity of opinion. In the Northern States considerable\r\nadvances had been made in manufacturing industry, in different places,\r\nespecially at Waltham (Mass.); but a great manufacturing interest had\r\nnot yet grown up. The strength of this interest as yet lay mainly in\r\nPennsylvania. Navigation and foreign trade were the leading pursuits of\r\nthe North; and these interests, it was feared, would suffer from the\r\nattempt to build up manufactures by a protective tariff. It is\r\naccordingly a well-known fact, which may teach all to entertain\r\nopinions on public questions with some distrust of their own judgment,\r\nthat the tariff of 1816, containing the _minimum_ duty on coarse cotton\r\nfabrics, the corner-stone of the protective system, was supported by Mr.\r\nCalhoun and a few other Southern members, and carried by their influence\r\nagainst the opposition of the New England members generally, including\r\nMr. Webster. It has been stated, that, during the pendency of this law\r\nbefore Congress, he denied the constitutionality of a tariff for\r\nprotection. This statement is inaccurate; although, had it been true, it\r\nwould have placed him only in the same relation to the question with Mr.\r\nCalhoun and other Southern members, who at that time admitted the\r\nprinciple of protection, but lived to reject it as the grossest and most\r\npernicious constitutional heresy. It would have shown only that, in a\r\nlong political career, he had, on the first discussion of a new\r\nquestion, expressed an opinion which, in the lapse of time and under a\r\nchange of circumstances, he had seen occasion to alter. This is no\r\nground of just reproach. It has happened to every public man in every\r\nfree country, who has been of importance enough to have his early\r\nopinions remembered. It has happened to a large portion of the prominent\r\nmen at the South, in reference to almost every great question agitated\r\nwithin the last generation. The bank, internal improvements, a navy, the\r\nColonization Society, the annexation of Texas, the power of Congress\r\nover the territories, this very question of the tariff, the doctrine of\r\nState rights generally, are subjects on which many prominent statesmen\r\nof the South, living or recently deceased, have in the course of their\r\ncareer entertained opposite views.\r\n\r\nBut it is not true that Mr. Webster in 1816 denied the constitutionality\r\nof a tariff for protection. In 1820, in discussing the subject in\r\nFaneuil Hall, he argued that, if the right of laying duties for\r\nprotection were derived from the revenue power, it was of necessity\r\nincidental; and on that assumption, as the incident cannot go beyond\r\nthat to which it is incidental, duties avowedly for protection, and not\r\nhaving any reference to revenue, could not be constitutionally laid. The\r\nhypothetical form of the statement shows a degree of indecision; while\r\nthe proposition itself is not to be gainsaid. At a later period, and\r\nafter it had been confidently stated, and satisfactorily shown by Mr.\r\nMadison, that the Federal Convention intended, under the provision for\r\nregulating commerce, to clothe Congress with the power of laying duties\r\nfor the protection of manufactures; and after Congress had, by repeated\r\nlaws, passed against the wishes of the navigating and strictly\r\ncommercial interests, practically settled this constitutional question,\r\nand turned a vast amount of the capital of the country into the channel\r\nof manufactures; Mr. Webster considered a moderate degree of protection\r\n(such as would keep the home market steady under the occasional gluts in\r\nthe foreign market, and shield the domestic manufacturer from the\r\nwholesale frauds of foreign importation) as the established policy of\r\nthe United States; and he accordingly supported it. It is unnecessary to\r\nstate, that this course has been pursued with the approbation of his\r\nconstituents, and to the manifest good of the country. No change has\r\ntaken place in Mr. Webster's opinions on the subject of protection which\r\nhas not been generally shared and sanctioned by the intelligence of the\r\nmanufacturing States. There are strong indications, even, that in the\r\nSouthern States the superiority of the home market over the foreign is\r\nbeginning to be felt.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster took an active and efficient part, at the first session of\r\nthe Fourteenth Congress, in the debates on the charter of the Bank of\r\nthe United States, which passed Congress in April, 1816. While the bill\r\nwas before the House, he moved and carried several amendments similar to\r\nthose which he had caused to be introduced into the bill of the former\r\nyear. He exerted himself in vain, however, against the participation of\r\nthe government in its management, and, in common with several\r\nindependent members usually supporting the administration, he voted\r\nagainst it on its passage. Among the amendments to the bill, of which\r\nMr. Webster procured the adoption, was one which required _deposits_, as\r\nwell as the _notes_ of the bank, to be paid on demand in specie.\r\n\r\nBut the great service rendered by Mr. Webster to the currency of the\r\ncountry in the Fourteenth Congress was in procuring the adoption of the\r\nspecie resolution, in virtue of which, from and after the 20th of\r\nFebruary, 1817, all debts due to the treasury were required to be paid\r\nin the legal currency of the country (gold or silver), in treasury\r\nnotes, or the notes of the Bank of the United States, or in notes of\r\nbanks which are payable and paid on demand in the same legal currency.\r\nThis service can hardly be appreciated at the present day by those too\r\nyoung to recollect the state of things existing in this respect during\r\nthe war and after its close. This resolution passed the two houses, and\r\nwas approved by the President on the 30th of April, 1816. It completely\r\naccomplished its object; and that object was to restore to a sound basis\r\nthe currency of the country, and to give the people a uniform\r\ncirculating medium. Of this they were destitute at the close of the war.\r\nAll the banks, except those of the New England States, had suspended\r\nspecie payments; but their depreciated bills were permitted by general\r\nconsent, and within certain limits, to circulate as money. They were\r\nreceived of each other by the different banks; they passed from hand to\r\nhand; and even the public revenue was collected at par in this degraded\r\npaper. The rate of depreciation was different in different States, and\r\nwith different banks in the same States, according as greater or less\r\nadvantage had been taken of the suspension of the specie obligation.\r\n\r\nWhat was not less harassing than this diversity was the uncertainty\r\neverywhere prevailing, how far the reputed rate of depreciation in any\r\nparticular case might represent justly the real condition of a bank or\r\nset of banks. In other words, men were obliged to make and receive\r\npayments in a currency of which, at the time, the value was not\r\ncertainly known to them, and which might vary as it was passing\r\nthrough their hands. The enormous injustice suffered by the citizens\r\nof different States, in being obliged to pay their dues at the\r\ncustom-houses in as many different currencies as there were States,\r\nvarying at least twenty-five per cent. between Boston and Richmond,\r\nneed not be pointed out. For all these mischiefs the resolution of Mr.\r\nWebster afforded a remedy as efficient as simple; and what chiefly\r\nmoves our astonishment at the present day is, that a measure of this\r\nkind, demanded by the first principles of finance, overlooked by the\r\nexecutive and its leading friends in Congress, should be left to be\r\nbrought forward by one of its youngest members, and he not belonging to\r\nthe supporters of the administration. But commanding talent and\r\nprofound knowledge of the subjects to be treated vindicate to\r\nthemselves a position in public bodies, which official relations can\r\nneither confer nor take away. It would not be easy to name a political\r\nmeasure, in the history of the government, which has accomplished its\r\ndesign with greater simplicity and directness; and that design one of\r\nparamount importance to the country, and coming home to the business\r\nof every individual.\r\n\r\nIn all the other public measures brought forward in this Congress for\r\nmeeting the new conditions of the country, Mr. Webster bore an active\r\npart, but they furnish no topic requiring illustration. At the close of\r\nthe first session, in August, 1816, he executed the project to which we\r\nhave already alluded of removing to a wider professional field. After\r\nsome hesitation he decided on Boston, in which and its vicinity he has\r\never since made his home. He had established friendly relations here at\r\nan early period of life. In no part of the Union was his national\r\nreputation more cordially recognized than in the metropolis of New\r\nEngland. He took at once the place in his profession which belonged to\r\nhis commanding talent and legal eminence, and was welcomed into every\r\ncircle of social life.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n    [4] Lives of the Chancellors, Vol. VII. p. 218; see also p. 301.\r\n\r\n    [5] The friend to whom the letter referred to by Mr. March was\r\n        written, was Mr. Justice Story, who adds: \"Such praise from such\r\n        a man ought to be very gratifying.

It was accordingly within this period that his\r\nreputation as a lawyer was fixed and established. The promise of his\r\nyouth, and the expectations of those who had known him as a student,\r\nwere more than fulfilled. He took a position as a counsellor and an\r\nadvocate, above which no one has ever risen in the country. A large\r\nshare of the best business of New England passed into his hands; and the\r\nveterans of the Boston bar admitted him to an entire equality of\r\nstanding, repute, and influence.\r\n\r\nBesides the reputation which he acquired in the ordinary routine of\r\npractice, Mr. Webster, shortly after his removal to Boston, took the\r\nlead in establishing what might almost be called a new school of\r\nconstitutional law. It fell to his lot to perform a prominent part in\r\nunfolding a most important class of constitutional doctrines, which,\r\neither because occasion had not drawn them forth, or the jurists of a\r\nformer period had failed to deduce and apply them, had not yet grown\r\ninto a system. It was reserved for Mr. Webster to distinguish himself\r\nbefore most, if not all, of his contemporaries, in this branch of his\r\nprofession. It may be mentioned as a somewhat curious coincidence, that\r\nthe case in which he made his first great effort in this direction arose\r\nin his native State, and concerned the College in which he had been\r\neducated.\r\n\r\nIn the months of June and December, 1816, the legislature of New\r\nHampshire passed acts altering the charter of Dartmouth College (of\r\nwhich the name was changed to Dartmouth University), enlarging the\r\nnumber of the trustees, and generally reorganizing the corporation.\r\nThese acts, although passed without the consent and against the protest\r\nof the Trustees of the College, went into operation. The newly created\r\nbody took possession of the corporate property, and assumed the\r\nadministration of the institution. The old board were all named as\r\nmembers of the new corporation, but declined acting as such, and brought\r\nan action against the treasurer of the new board for the books of\r\nrecord, the original charter, the common seal, and other corporate\r\nproperty of the College.\r\n\r\nThe action was commenced in the Court of Common Pleas for Grafton\r\nCounty, in February, 1817, and carried immediately to the Superior\r\nCourt, in May of the same year. The general issue was pleaded by the\r\ndefendants and joined by the plaintiffs. The case turned upon the point,\r\nwhether the acts of the legislature above referred to were binding upon\r\nthe corporation without their assent, and not repugnant to the\r\nConstitution of the United States. It was first argued by Messrs.\r\nJeremiah Mason and Jeremiah Smith for the plaintiffs, and by the\r\nAttorney-General of New Hampshire for the defendants; and subsequently\r\nby Messrs. Mason, Smith, and Webster for the plaintiffs, and the\r\nAttorney-General and Mr. L Bartlett for the defendants. At the November\r\nterm it was decided by the Superior Court of New Hampshire, in an\r\nopinion delivered by Chief Justice Richardson, that the acts of the New\r\nHampshire legislature were valid and constitutional. In giving his\r\nopinion on the case, the Chief Justice said: \"The cause has been argued\r\non both sides with uncommon learning and ability, and we have witnessed\r\na display of talents and eloquence upon this occasion in the highest\r\ndegree honorable to the profession of the law in this State.\"[6]\r\n\r\nThe case thus decided in the Superior Court of New Hampshire in favor of\r\nthe validity of the State laws, was carried by writ of error to the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, where, on the 10th of March, 1818,\r\nit came on for argument before all the judges, Mr. Webster and Mr.\r\n(afterwards Judge) Hopkinson for the plaintiffs, and Mr. J. Holmes of\r\nMaine and the Attorney-General, Wirt, for the defendants in error. This\r\nwas perhaps the first occasion in this country on which a question\r\nprecisely of this kind had come up, and it is stated that, when one of\r\nthe court had run his eye cursorily over the record, he said that he did\r\nnot see how any thing important could be urged by the plaintiffs in\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nIt devolved upon Mr. Webster, as junior counsel, to open the case, and\r\nit is scarcely necessary to say to any one who has read the report of\r\nhis argument, that, if such an impression as that just alluded to\r\nexisted in the mind of any of the court, it must have been immediately\r\ndispelled. The ground was broadly taken, that the acts in question were\r\nnot only against common right and the constitution of New Hampshire, but\r\nalso, and this was the leading principle, against the provision of the\r\nConstitution of the United States which forbids the individual States\r\nfrom passing laws that impair the obligation of contracts. Under the\r\nfirst head, the entire English law relative to educational foundations\r\nwas unfolded by Mr. Webster, and it was shown that colleges, unless\r\notherwise specifically constituted by their charters, were private\r\neleemosynary corporations, over whose property, members, and franchises\r\nthe crown has no control, except by due process of law, for acts\r\ninconsistent with their charters. The whole learning of the subject was\r\nbrought to bear with overwhelming weight on this point.\r\n\r\nThe second main point required to be less elaborately argued; namely,\r\nthat such a charter is a contract which it is not competent for a State\r\nto annul. The argument throughout was pursued with a closeness and vigor\r\nwhich have been rarely witnessed in our courts. The topics were beyond\r\nthe usual range of forensic investigation in this country. The\r\nconstitutional principles sought to be applied were of commanding\r\nimportance. Great public expectation was awakened by the novelty and\r\nmagnitude of the case. The personal connection of Mr. Webster with\r\nDartmouth College as the place of his education gave a fervor to his\r\nmanner, which added, no doubt, to the effect of the reasoning. On this\r\npoint Mr. Ticknor expresses himself as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. Webster's argument is given in this volume [the first\r\n  collection of his works], that is, we have there the technical\r\n  outline; the dry skeleton of it. But those who heard him when it was\r\n  originally delivered still wonder how such dry bones could ever\r\n  have lived with the power they there witnessed and felt. He\r\n  opened his cause, as he always does, with perfect simplicity in\r\n  the general statement of its facts, and then went on to unfold\r\n  the topics of his argument in a lucid order, which made each\r\n  position sustain every other. The logic and the law were rendered\r\n  irresistible. But as he advanced, his heart warmed to the subject\r\n  and the occasion. Thoughts and feelings that had grown old with\r\n  his best affections rose unbidden to his lips. He remembered that\r\n  the institution he was defending was the one where his own youth\r\n  had been nurtured; and the moral tenderness and beauty this gave to\r\n  the grandeur of his thoughts, the sort of religious sensibility\r\n  it imparted to his urgent appeals and demands for the stern\r\n  fulfilment of what law and justice required, wrought up the whole\r\n  audience to an extraordinary state of excitement. Many betrayed\r\n  strong agitation, many were dissolved in tears. Prominent among them\r\n  was that eminent lawyer and statesman, Robert Goodloe Harper, who\r\n  came to him when he resumed his seat, evincing emotions of the\r\n  highest gratification. When he ceased to speak, there was a\r\n  perceptible interval before any one was willing to break the\r\n  silence; and when that vast crowd separated, not one person of the\r\n  whole number doubted that the man who had that day so moved,\r\n  astonished, and controlled them, had vindicated for himself a\r\n  place at the side of the first jurists of the country.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the court, unanimous; with the exception of Justice\r\nDuvall, was pronounced by Chief Justice Marshall in the term for\r\n1819, declaring the acts of the legislature of New Hampshire to be\r\nunconstitutional and invalid, and reversing the opinion of the court\r\nbelow. By this opinion the law of the land in reference to collegiate\r\ncharters was firmly established. Henceforward our colleges and\r\nuniversities and their trustees, unless provision to the contrary is\r\nmade in their acts of incorporation, stand upon the broad basis of\r\ncommon right and justice; holding in like manner as individuals their\r\nproperty and franchises by a firm legal tenure, and not subject to\r\ncontrol or interference on the part of the local legislatures on the\r\nvague ground that public institutions are at the mercy of the\r\ngovernment. That such is the recognized law of the land is owing in\r\nno small degree to the ability with which the Dartmouth College case\r\nwas argued by Mr. Webster. The battle fought and the victory gained in\r\nthis case were sought and gained for every college and university, for\r\nevery academy and school, in the United States, endowed with property\r\nor possessed of chartered rights. It ought to be mentioned, to the\r\ncredit of the State of New Hampshire, that she readily acquiesced in the\r\ndecision of the Supreme Court of the United States, and made no attempt\r\nto sustain her recent legislation.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated cause, argued with such success before the highest\r\ntribunal in the country, established Mr. Webster's position in the\r\nprofession. It placed him at once with Emmett and Pinkney and Wirt, in\r\nthe front rank of the American bar, and, though considerably the\r\nyoungest of this illustrious group, on an equality with the most\r\ndistinguished of them. He was henceforward retained in almost every\r\nconsiderable cause argued at Washington. No counsel in the United States\r\nhas probably been engaged in a larger portion of the business brought\r\nbefore that tribunal. While Mr. Webster as a politician and a statesman\r\nhas performed an amount of intellectual labor, as is abundantly shown in\r\nthese volumes, sufficient to form the sole occupation of an active life,\r\nthere is no doubt that his arguments to the court and his addresses to\r\nthe jury in important suits at law would, if they had been reported like\r\nhis political speeches, have filled a much greater space.\r\n\r\nIt would exceed the limits of this sketch to allude in detail to all\r\nthe cases argued by Mr. Webster in the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates; still less would it be practicable to trace him through his\r\nlabors in the State courts. We can barely mention a few of the more\r\nconsiderable causes. The case of Gibbons and Ogden, in 1824, is one of\r\ngreat celebrity. In this case the grant by the State of New York to\r\nthe assignees of Fulton, of an exclusive right to navigate the\r\nrivers, harbors, and bays of New York by steam, was called in question,\r\nand was decided to be unconstitutional, after having been maintained by\r\nall the tribunals of that great and respectable State. The decision of\r\nthis great case turned upon the principle, that the grant of such a\r\nmonopoly of the right to enter a portion of the navigable waters of\r\nthe Union was an encroachment, by the State, upon the power \"to\r\nregulate commerce,\"----a power reserved by the Constitution to Congress,\r\nand in its nature exclusive. The cause was argued by Messrs. Webster\r\nand Wirt for the plaintiffs, and by Messrs. Oakley and Emmett for the\r\ndefendants in error,--an array of talent worthy the magnitude of the\r\ninterests at stake. The decision of the court was against the monopoly.\r\nFew cases in the annals of federal jurisprudence are of equal\r\nimportance; none, perhaps, was ever argued with greater ability. In the\r\ncourse of his discussion, Mr. Webster said, with great felicity of\r\nillustration, that, by the establishment of the Constitution, the\r\ncommerce of this whole country had become a _unit_, a form of\r\nexpression used with approbation by Chief Justice Marshall in\r\ndelivering the opinion of the court.\r\n\r\nA very distinguished compliment was paid to Mr. Webster's argument in\r\nthis case, a quarter of a century after its delivery, by Mr. Justice\r\nWayne of the Supreme Court of the United States. On the occasion of Mr.\r\nWebster's visit to the South, in the spring of 1847, he was received\r\nwith public honors, among other places, at Savannah. He was there\r\naddressed by Judge Wayne on behalf of his fellow-citizens. In the course\r\nof his remarks on that occasion, Judge Wayne alluded to Mr. Webster's\r\nline of argument in this case in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n  \"From one of your constitutional suggestions, every man in the land\r\n  has been more or less benefited. We allude to it with the greater\r\n  pleasure, because it was in a controversy begun by a Georgian in\r\n  behalf of the constitutional rights of the citizen. When the late\r\n  Mr. Thomas Gibbons determined to put to hazard a large part of his\r\n  fortune in testing the constitutionality of the laws of New York\r\n  limiting the navigation of the waters of that State to steamers\r\n  belonging to a company, his own interest was not so much concerned\r\n  as the right of every citizen to use a coasting license upon the\r\n  waters of the United States, in whatever way their vessels might be\r\n  propelled. It was a sound view of the law, but not broad enough for\r\n  the occasion. It is not unlikely that the case would have been\r\n  decided upon it, if you had not insisted that it should be put upon\r\n  the broader constitutional ground of commerce and navigation. The\r\n  court felt the application and force of your reasoning, and it made\r\n  a decision releasing every creek, and river, lake, bay, and harbor\r\n  in our country from the interference of monopolies, which had\r\n  already provoked unfriendly legislation between some of the States,\r\n  and which would have been as little favorable to the interest of\r\n  Fulton, as they were unworthy his genius.\"\r\n\r\nThe case of Ogden and Saunders, in 1827, brought in question the\r\nright of a State to pass an insolvent law. It was of course a case\r\nof high constitutional law, belonging to the same general class with\r\nthose just mentioned, and relating to the limit of the powers of the\r\nseveral States, in reference to matters confided by the Constitution to\r\nthe general government. This cause was argued by Mr. Clay and Mr. David\r\nB. Ogden of New York for the plaintiffs, and by Mr. Webster and Mr.\r\nHenry Wheaton for the defendants in error. In his argument in this\r\ncase, Mr. Webster maintained the entire unconstitutionality of State\r\nbankrupt laws. This was a step in advance of the doctrines laid down\r\nby the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Sturges and\r\nCrowninshield, nor did the court on the present occasion incline to go\r\nfurther than they had done in that case. They were divided in opinion,\r\nbut a majority of the judges held, that, although it was not competent\r\nto a State to pass a law discharging a debtor from the obligation of\r\npayment, they might pass a law to discharge him from imprisonment on\r\npersonal execution. The Chief Justice and Judge Story were the\r\nminority of the court, and the opinion of the Chief Justice sustained\r\nthe principle of Mr. Webster's argument, which is, in fact, usually\r\nregarded as not falling below his most successful forensic efforts. The\r\nmanner in which he meets the argument in favor of a prospective State\r\ninsolvent law, namely, that such a law cannot impair the obligation of a\r\ncontract because it is a part of the contract, may be quoted as a\r\nspecimen of the acutest dialectics brought in aid of the broadest views\r\nof constitutional law.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1836, Mr. Webster argued at Washington the great cause of\r\nthe proprietors of Charles River Bridge. This well-remembered case was a\r\nsuit in chancery commenced in the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, where\r\nthe bill was dismissed by a decree _pro forma_, the members of that\r\ncourt being equally divided in opinion. A writ of error was taken to the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, on the ground that the rights of the\r\nproprietors of Charles River Bridge under their charter had been\r\nviolated by the legislature, in authorizing the erection of Warren\r\nBridge. The cause was argued at Washington, in 1836, and, having been\r\nthen held under advisement by the court for a year, was, upon difference\r\nof opinion among the judges, ordered to be again argued, which was done\r\nin 1837. This was another of the great constitutional cases argued by\r\nMr. Webster before the Supreme Court of the United States. The abstract\r\nprinciples of the case were perhaps as clear as in those to which we\r\nhave alluded; but there were practical difficulties, no doubt, in their\r\napplication to restrain the right of a legislature to grant an act of\r\nincorporation, in the usual form, for the construction of a new bridge,\r\non the ground of interference with some prior similar franchise. The\r\nopinion of the court, adverse to the complainants, was delivered by\r\nChief Justice Taney. Mr. Justice McLean was clearly of opinion that the\r\nmerits of the case were with the complainants, but that the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States had no jurisdiction over it. Mr. Justice\r\nStory dissented from the majority, and sustained the doctrines advanced\r\nby Mr. Webster in a very learned and powerfully reasoned opinion.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 the constitutional rights of the Bank of the United States (so\r\ncalled), which was incorporated by the State of Pennsylvania after the\r\ntermination of the Congressional charter, were drawn in question by a\r\ncase from the State of Alabama, in which the right of a corporation or a\r\ncitizen in one State to perform any legal act in another was asserted by\r\nMr. Webster, and his argument was sustained by the court. Not long\r\nafterwards the controversy between Massachusetts and Rhode Island\r\nrelative to their boundary, a controversy running back to the earliest\r\nperiods of their colonial history, was brought before the Supreme Court,\r\nat Washington, and argued by Mr. Webster for the Commonwealth of\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 the important case relative to the validity of Mr. Girard's\r\nbequest of the greater part of his estate to the city of Philadelphia,\r\nfor the foundation of a college for orphans, was argued by Mr. Webster\r\nbefore the Supreme Court, at Washington, for the heirs at law. One of\r\nthe grounds on which the bequest was impeached by them was, the\r\nexclusion by the will of all ecclesiastics, missionaries, or ministers,\r\nof whatever sect, from all offices in the college, and even from\r\nadmission within the premises as visitors. So impressive was Mr.\r\nWebster's argument upon the importance of making provision for religious\r\ninstruction in all institutions for education, that a meeting of the\r\ncitizens of Washington belonging to different religious denominations\r\nwas held, at which a resolution was passed expressing the opinion\r\nentertained by the meeting of the great value of Mr. Webster's argument,\r\n\"in demonstrating the vital importance of Christianity to the success of\r\nour free institutions, and that the general diffusion of that argument\r\namong the people of the United States is a matter of deep public\r\ninterest.\" A committee of eight gentlemen of the different denominations\r\nof Christians in the city was appointed to wait upon Mr. Webster, and\r\nrequest him to prepare for the press the report of that portion of his\r\nargument in which this important topic is treated.\r\n\r\nIn the month of January, 1848, the great Rhode Island case was brought\r\nbefore the Supreme Court of the United States, and argued by Mr.\r\nWebster for the chartered government of the State, and against the\r\ninsurrectionary government, to which an abortive attempt had been\r\nmade to give the form of a constitution, by a pretended act of the\r\npopular will. The true principles of popular and constitutional\r\ngovernment are explored with unsurpassed sagacity in this argument. Some\r\ncopies of the report of it in a pamphlet form reached Europe during\r\nthe memorable year of 1848, when the Continent was convulsed with\r\nrevolutionary struggles from one end to the other. It was there\r\nregarded as a most seasonable and instructive commentary on the nature\r\nof constitutional obligations, and of the rights of the people to modify\r\ntheir institutions of government.\r\n\r\nA large portion of the causes argued by Mr. Webster belong to the\r\nprovince of constitutional law, and have their origin in that partition\r\nof powers which exists between the State governments and the government\r\nof the United States, each clothed with sovereignty in its appropriate\r\nsphere, each subject to limitations resulting from its relations to the\r\nother, each possessing its legislative bodies, its judicial tribunals,\r\nits executive authorities, and consequently armed with the means of\r\nasserting its rights, and both combined into one great political system.\r\nIn such a system it cannot but happen that questions of conflicting\r\njurisdiction should arise. When we consider that the powers of these two\r\norders of government are defined in written constitutions of recent\r\ndate, and that all the direct precedents of administration must of\r\nnecessity, at the oldest, be still more recent, we cannot but wonder at\r\nthe small number of disputed cases which have arisen, and at the\r\nsagacity, forethought, and practical wisdom of the founders of our\r\ngovernment, who made such admirable provision for the harmonious\r\noperation of the system.\r\n\r\nStill, however, it was impossible that the class of cases provided for\r\nby the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States\r\nshould not present themselves, and no small portion of Mr. Webster's\r\nforensic life has been devoted to their investigation. It is unnecessary\r\nto state that they are questions of an elevated character. They often\r\ninvolve the validity of the legislative acts and judicial decisions of\r\ngovernments substantially independent, as they may in fact the\r\nconstitutionality of the acts of Congress itself. No court in England\r\nwill allow any thing, not even a treaty with a foreign government, or\r\nthe most undoubted principles of the law of nations, to be pleaded\r\nagainst an act of Parliament. The Supreme Court of the United States\r\nentertains the question not only of the constitutionality of the acts of\r\nthe legislatures of States possessing most of the attributes of\r\nsovereignty, but also of the constitutionality of the acts of the\r\nnational legislature, which possesses those attributes of sovereignty\r\nwhich are denied to the States. These circumstances give great dignity\r\nto its deliberations, and tend materially to elevate the character of a\r\nconstitutional lawyer in the United States.[8] Professional training in\r\nEngland has not been deemed the best school of statesmanship; but it\r\nwill be readily perceived, that in this country a great class of\r\nquestions, and those of the highest importance, belong alike to the\r\nsenate and the court. Every one must feel that, in the case of Mr.\r\nWebster, the lawyer and the statesman have contributed materially to\r\nform each other.\r\n\r\nBefore quite quitting this subject, it may be proper to allude to Mr.\r\nWebster's professional labors of another class, in the ordinary State\r\ntribunals. Employed as counsel in all the most important cases during a\r\nlong professional life, it is hardly necessary to say, that his\r\ninvestigations have extended to every department of the law, and that\r\nhis speeches to the jury and arguments to the court have evinced a\r\nmastery of the learning and a control of the logic belonging to it,\r\nwhich are in most cases to be attained only by the exclusive study and\r\npractice of a life. The jurist and the advocate are so mingled in Mr.\r\nWebster's professional character, that it is not easy to say which\r\npredominates. His fervid spirit and glowing imagination place at his\r\ncontrol all the resources of an overwhelming rhetoric, and make him\r\nall-powerful with a jury; while the ablest court is guided by his severe\r\nlogic, and instructed by the choice which he lays before them of the\r\nmost appropriate learning of the cases which he argues. It happens,\r\nunfortunately, that forensic efforts of this kind are rarely reported at\r\nlength. A brief sketch of an important law argument finds a place in the\r\nhistory of the case, but distinguished counsel rarely have time or\r\nbestow the labor required to reproduce in writing an elaborate address\r\neither to court or jury. There is probably no species of intellectual\r\nlabor of the highest order, which perishes for want of a contemporary\r\nrecord to the same extent as that which is daily exerted in the courts\r\nof law.\r\n\r\nThe present collection contains two speeches addressed to the jury by\r\nMr. Webster in criminal trials. One was delivered in the case of\r\nGoodridge, and in defence of the persons whom he accused of having\r\nrobbed him on the highway. This cause was tried in 1817, shortly after\r\nthe establishment of Mr. Webster at Boston. Rarely has a case, in itself\r\nof no greater importance, produced a stronger impression of the ability\r\nof the counsel. The cross-examination of Goodridge, who pretended to\r\nhave been robbed, and who had previously been considered a person of\r\nsome degree of respectability, is still remembered at the bar of\r\nMassachusetts as terrific beyond example, and the speech to the jury in\r\nwhich his artfully contrived tale was stripped of its disguises may be\r\nstudied as a model of this species of exposition.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster's speech to the jury in the memorable case of John F. Knapp\r\nis of a higher interest. The great importance of this case, as well on\r\naccount of the legal principles involved, as of the depth of the tragedy\r\nin real life with which it was connected, has given it a painful\r\ncelebrity. A detailed history of the case and of the trial, from the pen\r\nof the late ingenious and learned Mr. Merrill, will be found prefixed to\r\nMr. Webster's speech, as contained in the fifth volume of this\r\ncollection. The record of the _causes celebres_ of no country or age\r\nwill furnish either a more thrilling narrative, or a forensic effort of\r\ngreater ability. A passage on the power of conscience will arrest the\r\nattention of the reader. There is nothing in the language superior to\r\nit. It was unquestionably owing to the legal skill and moral courage\r\nwith which the case was conducted by Mr. Webster, that one of the\r\nfoulest crimes ever committed was brought to condign punishment; and the\r\nnicest refinements of the law of evidence were made the means of working\r\nout the most important practical results. But it is time to return to\r\nthe chronological series of events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n    [6] 1 New Hampshire Reports, p. 113.\r\n\r\n    [7] American Review, Vol. IX. p. 434.\r\n\r\n    [8] \"Crescit enim cum amplitudine rerum vis ingenii, nec quisquam\r\n        claram et inlustrem orationem efficere potest, nisi qui causam\r\n        parem invenit.\" The dialogue _De Oratoribus_, Sec. 37, usually\r\n        printed with the works of Tacitus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  The Convention to revise the Constitution of Massachusetts.--John\r\n  Adams a Delegate.--Mr. Webster's Share in its Proceedings.--Speeches\r\n  on Oaths of Office, Basis of Senatorial Representation, and\r\n  Independence of the Judiciary.--Centennial Anniversary at Plymouth\r\n  on the 22d of December, 1820.--Discourse delivered by Mr.\r\n  Webster.--Bunker Hill Monument, and Address by Mr. Webster on the\r\n  Laying of the Corner-Stone, 17th of June, 1825.--Discourse on the\r\n  Completion of the Monument, 17th of June, 1843.--Simultaneous\r\n  Decease of Adams and Jefferson on the 4th of July, 1826.--Eulogy by\r\n  Mr. Webster in Faneuil Hall.--Address at the Laying of the\r\n  Corner-Stone of the New Wing of the Capitol.--Remarks on the\r\n  Patriotic Discourses of Mr. Webster, and on the Character of his\r\n  Eloquence in Efforts of this Class.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1820, on the separation of Maine, a convention became necessary in\r\nMassachusetts to readjust the Senate; and the occasion was deemed a\r\nfavorable one for a general revision of the constitution. The various\r\ntowns in the Commonwealth were authorized by law to choose as many\r\ndelegates as they were entitled to elect members to the House of\r\nRepresentatives; and a body was constituted containing much of the\r\ntalent, political experience, and weight of character of the State. Mr.\r\nWebster was chosen one of the delegates from Boston; and, with the\r\nexception of a few days' service, two or three years afterwards, in the\r\nMassachusetts House of Representatives;[9] this is the only occasion on\r\nwhich he ever filled any political office under the State government\r\neither of Massachusetts or New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nThe venerable John Adams, second President of the United States, was a\r\ndelegate to this convention from Quincy. He was the author of the\r\noriginal draft of the State constitution in 1780, and although his\r\nadvanced age (he was now eighty-six years old) made it impossible for\r\nhim to take an active part in the proceedings of the convention, he\r\nreceived the honor of a unanimous election as president. He declined the\r\nappointment; and Chief Justice Parker was chosen in his place.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1820 was no doubt as respectable a political body as\r\never assembled in Massachusetts; and it is no more than justice to Mr.\r\nWebster to say, that, although he had been but a few years a citizen of\r\nthe Commonwealth, and was personally a stranger to most of his\r\nassociates, he was among the most efficient members of the body. He was\r\nnamed chairman of the committee to whom the important subject of oaths\r\nand qualifications for office was referred, and of the special committee\r\non that chapter of the constitution which relates to the \"University at\r\nCambridge.\" Besides taking a leading part in the discussion of most of\r\nthe important subjects which were agitated in the convention, he was the\r\nauthority most deferred to on questions of order, and in that way\r\nexercised a steady and powerful influence over the general course of its\r\nproceedings. It is believed that on this occasion the practice of\r\nconsidering business in committee of the whole body was for the first\r\ntime adopted in Massachusetts; that mode of procedure never having\r\nobtained in the legislature of the State. The dignified and efficient\r\nmanner in which the duties of the chair were performed by Mr. Webster,\r\nwhenever he was called to occupy it, was matter of general remark. It\r\nhas often been a subject of regret with those who witnessed the uncommon\r\naptitude evinced by him on these, as on similar occasions at Washington,\r\nfor the discharge of the duties of presiding officer of a deliberative\r\nassembly, that he was never, during his Congressional career, called to\r\nthe important office of Speaker of the House of Representatives.\r\nConsidering the relation of the House to the political condition of the\r\ncountry, there is no position under the government which bears more\r\ndirectly upon the general character of the public counsels. The place\r\nhas occasionally, both in former times and recently, been filled with\r\ngreat ability; but it has more frequently happened that speakers have\r\nbeen chosen from considerations of political expediency, and without\r\nregard to personal qualifications and fitness for the office. The\r\neffect has been highly prejudicial to the tone of the House, and its\r\nconsequent estimation in the country. It has frequently happened that\r\nthe decisions of the Speaker, as such, have commanded no respect. An\r\nappeal has been taken from them almost as a matter of course. The state\r\nof things is very different in the body most nearly resembling the\r\nhouses of Congress. Such a thing as an appeal from the decision of the\r\nSpeaker on a point of order is hardly known in the British House of\r\nCommons, and the disposition of all parties to acquiesce in, if not to\r\nsupport, the decisions of the chair, is one of the characteristic\r\nfeatures of that assembly.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the Massachusetts convention were ably reported, from\r\nday to day, in the Boston Daily Advertiser; but a contemporary report\r\nusually implies much abridgment of the speeches. Much that was said by\r\nMr. Webster, as by other prominent speakers, appeared but in a condensed\r\nform; and it is believed, that, even when reported at greatest length\r\nand with most care, it was without the advantage of personal revision by\r\nthe speakers. The third volume of the present collection contains Mr.\r\nWebster's remarks on those provisions of the constitution which related\r\nto oaths of office and formed a kind of religious test, which Mr.\r\nWebster was disposed to abolish; a speech upon the basis of senatorial\r\nrepresentation; and another upon the independence of the judiciary.\r\n\r\nIn the speech on the basis of the Senate, Mr. Webster defended the\r\nprinciple, which was incorporated into the original constitution, and\r\nis recognized by the liberal writers of greatest authority on\r\ngovernment, that due regard should be had to property in establishing\r\na basis of representation. He showed the connection between the\r\nsecurity of republican liberty and this principle. He first called\r\nattention in this country to the fact, that this important principle was\r\noriginally developed in Harrington's Oceana, a work much studied by\r\nour Revolutionary fathers. The practical consequence which Mr. Webster\r\ndeduced from the principle was, that constitutional and legal\r\nprovision ought to be made to produce the utmost possible diffusion\r\nand equality of property.\r\n\r\nIt is a melancholy instance of the injustice of party, that these views\r\nof Mr. Webster, which contain the philosophy of constitutional\r\nrepublicanism as distinct from a mere democracy of numbers, have, even\r\ndown to the present day, served as the basis of a charge against him of\r\nanti-popular principles. Having observed in the speech referred to,\r\n\"that it would seem to be the part of political wisdom to found\r\ngovernment on property, and to establish such a distribution of property\r\nby the laws which regulate its transmission and alienation, as to\r\ninterest the great majority of society in the protection of the\r\ngovernment,\" the former part of this sentence has often been quoted as a\r\nsubstantive rule in favor of a moneyed aristocracy, and the latter\r\nuncandidly suppressed. It is hardly necessary to observe, that the point\r\nat issue was the constitution of the senatorial districts on the basis\r\nof the valuation; and that it was never proposed by Mr. Webster, or by\r\nany body else, to apply the principle to individuals. The poor man in\r\nthe rich senatorial district possessed as much political power as his\r\nwealthy neighbor. The principle, in fact, is but another form of that\r\nwhich gave the first impulse to the American Revolution, namely, that\r\nrepresentation and taxation ought to go hand in hand.\r\n\r\nWhile the Massachusetts convention was in session, Mr. Webster appeared\r\nbefore the public in another department of intellectual effort, and with\r\nthe most distinguished success. It is hazardous for a person of great\r\nprofessional eminence to venture out of his sphere; perhaps the\r\nexperiment has never before been so triumphantly made. In 1820, Mr.\r\nWebster was invited by the Pilgrim Society at Plymouth to deliver a\r\ndiscourse on the great anniversary of New England, the ever-memorable\r\n22d of December. Several circumstances contributed on this occasion to\r\nthe interest of the day. The peaceful surrender by Massachusetts of a\r\nportion of her territory, greatly exceeding in magnitude that which she\r\nretained, in order to form the new State of Maine, was a pleasing\r\nexemplification of that prosperous multiplication of independent\r\ncommonwealths within the limits of the Union, which forms one of the\r\nmost distinctive features in our history. It was as much an alienation\r\nof territory from the local jurisdiction of Massachusetts, as if it had\r\nbeen ceded to Great Britain, and yet the alienation was cordially made.\r\nAt this very time a controversy existed between the United States and\r\nEngland, relative to the conflicting title of the two governments to a\r\nvery small portion, and that the least valuable part, of the same\r\nterritory, which, after the aggravations and irritations of forty years\r\nof controversy, was in 1842 adjusted by Mr. Webster and Lord Ashburton,\r\nat a moment when war seemed all but inevitable. In any other country or\r\nage of the world, Maine could have been severed from Massachusetts only\r\nby a bloody revolution. Their amicable separation by mutual consent,\r\nalthough neither the first nor the second similar event in the United\r\nStates, was still an occurrence which carried back the reflections of\r\nthoughtful men to the cradle of New England.\r\n\r\nThese reflections gathered interest from the convention then in session.\r\nIt was impossible not to feel with unusual force the contrast between\r\nthe circumstances under which the first simple compact of government,\r\nthe germ of the American constitutions, was drawn up on board the\r\nMayflower, and those under which the assembled experience, wisdom, and\r\npatriotism of the State were now engaged in reorganizing the government.\r\nSeveral of the topics which presented themselves to Mr. Webster's mind,\r\nand were discussed by him at Plymouth, had entered into the debates of\r\nthe convention a few days before. Still more, the close of the second\r\ncentury from the landing of the Fathers, with all its mighty series of\r\nevents in the social, political, and moral world, gave the highest\r\ninterest to the occasion. Six New England generations were to pass in\r\nreview. It was an anniversary which could be celebrated nowhere else as\r\nit could be at Plymouth. It was such an anniversary, with its store of\r\ntraditions, comparisons, and anticipations, as none then living could\r\nwitness again. The Pilgrim Society gave utterance to the unanimous\r\nfeeling of the community, in calling upon Mr. Webster to speak for the\r\nwhole people of New England, at home and abroad, on this great\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThe discourse delivered by him in pursuance of their invitation, in some\r\nrespects the most remarkable of his performances, begins the series of\r\nhis works contained in the present collection. The felicity and spirit\r\nwith which its descriptive portions are executed; the affecting tribute\r\nwhich it pays to the memory of the Pilgrims; the moving picture of their\r\nsufferings on both sides of the water; the masterly exposition and\r\nanalysis of those institutions to which the prosperity of New England\r\nunder Providence is owing; the eloquent inculcation of those great\r\nprinciples of republicanism on which our American commonwealths are\r\nfounded; the instructive survey of the past, the sublime anticipations\r\nof the future of America,--have long since given this discourse a\r\nclassical celebrity. Several of its soul-stirring passages have become\r\nas household words throughout the country. They are among the most\r\nfavorite of the extracts contained in the school-books. An entire\r\ngeneration of young men have derived from this noble performance some of\r\ntheir first lessons in the true principles of American republicanism. It\r\nobtained at once a wide circulation throughout the country, and gave to\r\nMr. Webster a position among the popular writers and speakers of the\r\nUnited States scarcely below that which he had already attained as a\r\nlawyer and a statesman. It is doubtful whether any extra-professional\r\nliterary effort by a public man has attained equal celebrity.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few years, when the corner-stone of the Bunker Hill\r\nMonument was to be laid, on the fiftieth anniversary of the battle, the\r\ngeneral expectation again pointed to Mr. Webster as the orator of the\r\nday. This, too, was a great national and patriotic anniversary. For the\r\nfirst time, and after the lapse of a half-century, the commencement of\r\nthe war of the American Revolution was to be publicly celebrated under\r\nnovel, significant, and highly affecting circumstances. Fifty years had\r\nextinguished all the unkindly associations of the day, and raised it\r\nfrom the narrow sphere of local history to a high place in the annals of\r\nthe world. A great confederacy had sprung from the blood of Bunker Hill.\r\nThis was too important an event in the history of the world to be\r\nsurrendered to hostile and party feeling. No friend of representative\r\ngovernment in England had reason to deplore the foundation of the\r\nAmerican republics. No one can doubt that the development of the\r\nrepresentative principle in this country has contributed greatly to\r\npromote the cause of Parliamentary reform in Great Britain. Other\r\nconsiderations gave great interest to the festival of the 17th of June,\r\n1825. Fifty years of national life, fortune, and experience, not\r\nexhibiting in their detail an unvarying series of prosperity, (for it\r\nwas fifty years in the history, not of angels, but of men,) but\r\nassuredly not surpassed in the grand aggregate by any half-century in\r\nthe annals of the world, were now brought to a close. Vast as the\r\ncontrast was in the condition of the country at the beginning and close\r\nof the period, there were still living venerable men who had acted\r\nprominent and efficient parts in the opening scenes of the drama. Men\r\nwho had shared the perils of 1775 shared the triumph of the jubilee.\r\nMore than a hundred of the heroes of the battle were among the joyous\r\nparticipators in this great festival. Not the least affecting incident\r\nof the celebration was the presence of Lafayette, who had hastened from\r\nhis more than royal progress through the Union to take a part in the\r\nceremonial.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say, that on such an occasion, with all these\r\ncircumstances addressed to the imaginations and the thoughts of men, in\r\nthe presence of a vast multitude of the intelligent population of\r\nMassachusetts and the other New England States, with no inconsiderable\r\nattendance of kindred and descendants from every part of the Union, an\r\naddress from such an orator as Mr. Webster, on such a platform, on such\r\na theme, in the flower of his age and the maturity of his faculties,\r\ndiscoursing upon an occasion of transcendent interest, and kindling with\r\nthe enthusiasm of the day and the spot, may well be regarded as an\r\nintellectual treat of the highest order. Happy the eyes that saw that\r\nmost glorious gathering! Happy the ears that heard the heart-stirring\r\nstrain!\r\n\r\nScarcely inferior in interest was the anniversary celebration, when the\r\nBunker Hill Monument was finally completed, in 1843, and Mr. Webster\r\nagain consented to address the immense multitude which the ceremonial\r\ncould not fail to bring together. In addition to all the other sources\r\nof public interest belonging to the occasion, the completion itself of\r\nthe structure was one to which the community attached great importance.\r\nIt had been an object steadily pursued, under circumstances of\r\nconsiderable discouragement, by a large number of liberal and patriotic\r\nindividuals, for nearly a quarter of a century. The great work was now\r\nfinished; and the most important event in the history of New England was\r\nhenceforward commemorated by a monument destined, in all human\r\nprobability, to last as long as any work erected by the hands of man.\r\nThe thrill of admiration which ran through the assembled thousands,\r\nwhen, at the commencement of his discourse on that occasion, Mr. Webster\r\napostrophized the monument itself as the mute orator of the day, has\r\nbeen spoken of by those who had the good fortune to be present as an\r\nemotion beyond the power of language to describe. The gesture, the look,\r\nthe tone of the speaker, as he turned to the majestic shaft, seemed to\r\ninvest it with a mysterious life; and men held their breath as if a\r\nsolemn voice was about to come down from its towering summit. This\r\naddress does not appear to have had the advantage possessed by those of\r\nPlymouth in 1820, and of Bunker Hill in 1825, in having been written out\r\nfor the press by Mr. Webster. It seems to have been prepared for\r\npublication from the reporter's notes, with some hasty revision,\r\nperhaps, by the author.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July, 1826, occurred the extraordinary coincidence of the\r\ndeaths of Adams and Jefferson, within a few hours of each other, on the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence; an event with\r\nwhich they were both so closely connected, as members of the committee\r\nby which the ever-memorable state paper was prepared and brought into\r\nthe Continental Congress. The public mind was already predisposed for\r\npatriotic emotions and sentiments of every kind by many conspiring\r\ncauses. The recency of the Revolutionary contest, sufficiently\r\nillustrated by the fact that many of those engaged in it were still\r\nalive and had been the subjects of liberal provision by Congress; the\r\ncomplete, though temporary, fusion of parties, producing for a few years\r\na political lull, never witnessed to the same extent before or since;\r\nthe close of the half-century from the commencement of the Revolutionary\r\nWar, and the commemoration of its early conflicts on many of the spots\r\nwhere they occurred; the foundation of the Bunker Hill Monument, and of\r\na similar work on a smaller scale at Concord; the visit of Lafayette;\r\nabroad, the varying scenes of the Greek revolution and the popular\r\nmovement in many other parts of Europe,--united in exciting the public\r\nmind in this country. They kindled to new fervor the susceptible and\r\nimpulsive American temperament. The simultaneous decease of the\r\nillustrious patriarchs of the Revolution, under these circumstances of\r\ncoincidence, fell upon a community already prepared to be deeply\r\naffected. It touched a tender chord, which vibrated from one end of the\r\nUnion to the other. The affecting event was noticed throughout the\r\ncountry. Cities and States vied with each other in demonstrations of\r\nrespect for the memory of the departed. The heart of the country poured\r\nitself forth in one general utterance of reverential feeling. Nowhere\r\nwas the wonderful event noticed with greater earnestness and solemnity\r\nof public sentiment than in Boston. Faneuil Hall was shrouded in black.\r\nPerhaps for the first time since its erection an organ was placed in the\r\ngallery, and a sublime funeral service was performed. It is unnecessary\r\nto dwell upon the effect of preparations like these upon an intelligent\r\naudience, assembled under highly wrought feeling. They produced a tone\r\nof mind in unison with the magnificent effort of thought which was to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nIt has, perhaps, never been the fortune of an orator to treat a subject\r\nin all respects so extraordinary as that which called forth the eulogy\r\non Adams and Jefferson; a subject in which the characters commemorated,\r\nthe field of action, the magnitude of the events, and the peculiar\r\npersonal relations, were so important and unusual. Certainly it is not\r\nextravagant to add, that no similar effort of oratory was ever more\r\ncompletely successful. The speech ascribed to John Adams in the\r\nContinental Congress, on the subject of declaring the independence of\r\nthe Colonies,--a speech of which the topics of course present themselves\r\non the most superficial consideration of the subject, but of which a few\r\nhints only of what was actually said are supplied by the letters and\r\ndiaries of Mr. Adams,--is not excelled by any thing of the kind in our\r\nlanguage. Few things have taken so strong a hold of the public mind. It\r\nthrills and delights alike the student of history, who recognizes it at\r\nonce as the creation of the orator, and the common reader, who takes it\r\nto be the composition, not of Mr. Webster, but of Mr. Adams. From the\r\ntime the eulogy was delivered to the present day, the inquiry has been\r\noften made and repeated, sometimes even in letters addressed to Mr.\r\nWebster himself, whether this exquisite appeal is his or Mr. Adams's. An\r\nanswer to a letter of this kind will be found appended to the eulogy in\r\nthe present edition.\r\n\r\nThese discourses, with the exception of the second Bunker Hill\r\nAddress, were delivered within about five years of each other; the\r\nfirst on the 22d of December, 1820, the last on the 2d of August, 1826.\r\nWith the exception named, Mr. Webster has excused himself from the\r\ndelivery of public addresses of this class, though continually invited\r\nfrom almost every part of the country and upon occasions of every kind.\r\nWithin the last twelvemonth, however, he has yielded himself to the\r\npeculiar and urgent condition of public affairs, and has addressed his\r\nfellow-citizens on several occasions not immediately connected with\r\nsenatorial or professional duty, and with the power and felicity\r\nwhich mark his earlier efforts. The most remarkable of these recent\r\naddresses is his speech delivered at Washington on the 4th of July,\r\n1851, at the ceremonial of the laying of the corner-stone of the\r\naddition to the Capitol. This ceremonial, itself of no ordinary\r\ninterest, and the aspect of public affairs under which it was performed,\r\ngave a peculiar fervor and solemnity to Mr. Webster's treatment of the\r\nsubject. Never, perhaps, were the principles to which the great day is\r\nconsecrated unfolded in a few paragraphs with greater precision and\r\ncomprehensiveness; or the auspicious influence of these principles on\r\nthe progress of the country more happily set forth. The contrast\r\nbetween the United States of 1793, when the corner-stone of the original\r\nCapitol was laid by President Washington, and the United States of 1851,\r\nwhen this enlargement became necessary, is brought out with great skill\r\nand discrimination. The appeal to the Southern States, whether the\r\ngovernment under which the Union has grown and prospered is a\r\nblessing or a curse to the country, is a burst of the highest\r\neloquence. The allusion and apostrophe to Washington will be rehearsed\r\nby the generous youth of America as long as the English language is\r\nspoken on this side of the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nThis great oration, perhaps not premeditated so carefully, as far as the\r\nmere language is concerned, as those of an earlier date with which we\r\nhave classed it, is not inferior to either of them in the essentials of\r\npatriotic eloquence. It belongs, in common with them, to a species of\r\noratory neither forensic, nor parliamentary, nor academical; and which\r\nmight perhaps conveniently enough be described by the epithet which we\r\nhave just applied to it,--the patriotic. These addresses are strongly\r\ndiscriminated from the forensic and the parliamentary class of speeches,\r\nin being from the nature of the case more elaborately prepared. The\r\npublic taste in a highly cultivated community would not admit, in a\r\nperformance of this kind, those marks of extemporaneous execution,\r\nwhich it not only tolerates, but admires, in the unpremeditated efforts\r\nof the senate and the bar. The latter shines to greatest advantage in\r\nhappy impromptu strokes, whether of illustration or argument; the former\r\nadmits, and therefore demands, the graceful finish of a mature\r\npreparation.[10]\r\n\r\nIt is not, indeed, to be supposed, that an orator like Mr. Webster is\r\nslavishly tied down, on any occasion, to his manuscript notes, or to a\r\n_memoriter_ repetition of their contents. It may be presumed that in\r\nmany cases the noblest and the boldest flights, the last and warmest\r\ntints thrown upon the canvas, in discourses of this kind, were the\r\nunpremeditated inspiration of the moment of delivery. The opposite view\r\nwould be absurd, because it would imply that the mind, under the high\r\nexcitement of delivery, was less fertile and creative than in the repose\r\nof the closet. A speaker could not, if he attempted it, anticipate in\r\nhis study the earnestness and fervor of spirit induced by actual contact\r\nwith the audience; he could not by any possibility forestall the\r\nsympathetic influence upon his imagination and intellect of the\r\nlistening and applauding throng. However severe the method required by\r\nthe nature of the occasion, or dictated by his own taste, a speaker like\r\nMr. Webster will not often confine himself \"to pouring out fervors a\r\nweek old.\"\r\n\r\nThe orator who would do justice to a great theme or a great occasion\r\nmust thoroughly study and understand the subject; he must accurately,\r\nand if possible minutely, digest in writing beforehand the substance,\r\nand even the form, of his address; otherwise, though he may speak ably,\r\nhe will be apt not to make in all respects an able speech. He must\r\nentirely possess himself beforehand of the main things which he wishes\r\nto say, and then throw himself upon the excitement of the moment and the\r\nsympathy of the audience. In those portions of his discourse which are\r\ndidactic or narrative, he will not be likely to wander, in any\r\ndirection, far from his notes; although even in those portions new\r\nfacts, illustrations, and suggestions will be apt to spring up before\r\nhim as he proceeds. But when the topic rises, when the mind kindles from\r\nwithin, and the strain becomes loftier, or bolder, or more pathetic,\r\nwhen the sacred fountain of tears is ready to overflow, and audience and\r\nspeaker are moved by one kindred sympathetic passion, then the\r\nthick-coming fancies cannot be kept down, the storehouse of the memory\r\nis unlocked, images start up from the slumber of years, and all that the\r\norator has seen, read, heard, or felt returns in distinct shape and\r\nvivid colors. The cold and premeditated text will no longer suffice for\r\nthe glowing thought. The stately, balanced phrase gives place to some\r\nabrupt, graphic expression, that rushes unbidden to his lips. The\r\nunforeseen incident or locality furnishes an apt and speaking image; and\r\nthe discourse instinctively transposes itself into a higher key.\r\n\r\nMany illustrations of these remarks may be found in the following\r\nvolumes. We may refer particularly to the address to the survivors of\r\nthe Revolution and the apostrophe to Warren in the first discourse on\r\nBunker Hill. These were topics too obvious and essential, in an address\r\non laying the corner-stone of the monument, to have been omitted in the\r\norator's notes prepared beforehand. But no one will think that the\r\nentire apostrophe to Warren, as it stands in the reported speech, was\r\nelaborated in the closet and committed to memory. In fact there is a\r\nslight grammatical inaccuracy, caused by passing from the third person\r\nto the second in the same sentence, which is at once the natural\r\nconsequence and the proof of an unpremeditated expansion or elevation of\r\nthe preconceived idea. We see the process. When the sentence commenced,\r\n\"But, ah! him!\" it was evidently in the mind of the orator to close it\r\nby saying, \"How shall I speak of him?\" But in the progress of the\r\nsentence, forgetful, unconscious, of the grammatical form, but melting\r\nwith the thought, beholding, as he stood upon the spot where the hero\r\nfell, his beloved and beautiful image rising from the ground, he can no\r\nlonger speak of him. Willing subject of his own witchery, he clothes his\r\nconception with sensible forms, and speaks _to_ the glorious being whom\r\nhe has called back to life. He no longer attempts to discourse of Warren\r\nto the audience, but passing, after a few intervening clauses, from the\r\nthird person to the second, he exclaims, \"How shall I struggle with the\r\nemotions that stifle the utterance of _thy_ name! Our poor work may\r\nperish, but thine shall endure! This monument may moulder away; the\r\nsolid ground it rests upon may sink down to a level with the sea; but\r\nthy memory shall not fail!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n    [9] Mr. Webster makes the following playful allusion to this\r\n        circumstance in a speech at a public dinner in Syracuse (New\r\n        York), in the month of May of the present year:--\r\n\r\n        \"It has so happened that all the public services which I have\r\n        rendered in the world, in my day and generation, have been\r\n        connected with the general government. I think I ought to make\r\n        an exception. I was ten days a member of the Massachusetts\r\n        legislature, and I turned my thoughts to the search for some\r\n        good object in which I could be useful in that position; and,\r\n        after much reflection, I introduced a bill which, with the\r\n        general consent of both houses of the Massachusetts legislature,\r\n        passed into a law, and is now a law of the State, which enacts\r\n        that no man in the State shall catch trout in any other manner\r\n        than in the old way, with an ordinary hook and line.\"\r\n\r\n   [10] The leading ideas in this and the following paragraph may be found\r\n        in a review of Mr. Webster's Speeches, in the North American\r\n        Review, Vol. XLI. p. 241, written by the author of this Memoir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  Election to Congress from Boston.--State of Parties.--Meeting of the\r\n  Eighteenth Congress.--Mr. Webster's Resolution and Speech in favor\r\n  of the Greeks.--Argument in the Supreme Court in the Case of Gibbons\r\n  and Ogden.--Circumstances under which it was made.--Speech on the\r\n  Tariff Law of 1824.--A complete Revision of the Law for the\r\n  Punishment of Crimes against the United States reported by Mr.\r\n  Webster, and enacted.--The Election of Mr. Adams as President of the\r\n  United States.--Meeting of the Nineteenth Congress, and State of\r\n  Parties.--Congress of Panama, and Mr. Webster's Speech on that\r\n  Subject.--Election as a Senator of the United States.--Revision of\r\n  the Tariff Law by the Twentieth Congress.--Embarrassments of the\r\n  Question.--Mr. Webster's Course and Speech on this Subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1822, Mr. Webster consented to be a candidate for\r\nCongress for the city (then town) of Boston, and was chosen by a very\r\nlarge majority over his opponent, Mr. Jesse Putnam. The former party\r\ndistinctions, as has been already observed, had nearly lost their\r\nsignificance in Massachusetts, as in some other parts of the country.\r\nAs a necessary, or at least a natural consequence of this state of\r\nthings, four candidates had already been brought forward for the\r\nPresidential election of November, 1824; namely, Mr. John Quincy Adams\r\nof Massachusetts, Mr. Clay of Kentucky, General Jackson of Tennessee,\r\nand Mr. Crawford of Georgia. Mr. Calhoun of South Carolina and Mr.\r\nLowndes of the same State had also both been nominated by their\r\nfriends at an early period of the canvass; but the latter was soon\r\nremoved by death, and Mr. Calhoun withdrew his pretensions in favor of\r\nGeneral Jackson. All the candidates named had either originally belonged\r\nto the old Democratic party (or Republican party as it was then more\r\nusually called), or had for many years attached themselves to it; but\r\nno one of them was supported on that ground. Mr. Crawford alone had\r\nattempted to avail himself of the ancient party machinery, so far as to\r\naccept a nomination by a Congressional caucus of his friends. They\r\nformed, however, but a minority of the Republican members of Congress,\r\nand the signal failure of the nomination contributed to the final\r\nabandonment of that mode of procedure. No Presidential candidate has\r\nsince been nominated by a Congressional caucus. In the canvass of\r\n1824, it was the main effort of the friends of all the candidates, by\r\nholding out the prospect of a liberal basis of administration, to draw\r\nto themselves as many as possible of the old Federal party. In\r\nMassachusetts, and generally in New England, the fusion of parties was\r\ncomplete, and Mr. Adams received their united support. In the Middle\r\nStates the union was less perfect, and the votes of a large proportion\r\nof the old Federal party were given to General Jackson and Mr.\r\nCrawford.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional elections in Massachusetts are held a year in advance.\r\nIt was not till December, 1823, that Mr. Webster took his seat as a\r\nmember of the Eighteenth Congress. It has rarely happened to an\r\nindividual, by engaging in public life, to make an equal sacrifice of\r\npersonal interest. Born to an inheritance of poverty, struggling through\r\nyouth and early manhood against all the difficulties of straitened means\r\nand a narrow sphere, he had risen above them all, and was now in an\r\nadvantageous position, at the height of his reputation, receiving as\r\ngreat a professional income as any lawyer in the United States, and\r\nrapidly laying the foundation of an ample independence. All this was to\r\nbe put at risk for the hazardous uncertainties, and the scarcely less\r\nhazardous certainties, of public life. It was not till after repeated\r\nrefusals of a nomination to both houses of Congress, that Mr. Webster\r\nwas at last called upon, in a manner which seemed to him imperative, to\r\nmake the great sacrifice. In fact, it may truly be said, that, to an\r\nindividual of his commanding talent and familiarity with political\r\naffairs, and consequent ability to take a lead in the public business,\r\nthe question whether he shall do so is hardly submitted to his option.\r\nIt is one of the great privileges of second-rate men, that they are\r\npermitted in some degree to follow the bent of their inclinations. It\r\nwas the main inducement of Mr. Webster in returning to political life,\r\nthat the cessation of the coarse conflicts of party warfare seemed to\r\nhold out some hope that statesmanship of a higher order, an impartial\r\nstudy of the great interests of the country, and a policy aiming to\r\npromote the development of its vast natural resources, might be called\r\ninto action.\r\n\r\nAlthough the domestic politics of the United States were in a condition\r\nof repose, the politics of Europe at this time were disturbed and\r\nanxious. Revolutions had within a few years broken out in Naples,\r\nPiedmont, and Spain; while in Greece a highly interesting struggle was\r\nin progress, between the Christian population of that country and the\r\ngovernment of their Ottoman oppressors. At an early period of this\r\ncontest, it had attracted much notice in the United States. A\r\ncorrespondence had been opened between an accredited committee of the\r\nGrecian patriots sitting at Paris, with the celebrated Koray at their\r\nhead, and friends of the cause of Greece in this country;[11] and a\r\nformal appeal had been made to the people of the United States, by the\r\nMessenian Senate of Kalamata, the first revolutionary congress which\r\nassembled in Greece. President Monroe, both in his annual message of\r\nDecember, 1822, and in that of 1823, had expressed respect and sympathy\r\nfor their cause. The attention of Congress being thus called to the\r\nsubject, Mr. Webster thought it a favorable opportunity to speak an\r\nemphatic word, from a quarter whence it would be respected, in favor of\r\nthose principles of rational liberty and enlightened progress which were\r\nseeking to extend themselves in Europe. As the great strength of the\r\nGrecian patriots was to be derived, not from the aid of the governments\r\nof Christendom, but from the public opinion and the sympathy of the\r\ncivilized world, he felt that they had a peculiar right to expect some\r\ndemonstration of friendly feeling from the only powerful republican\r\nstate. He was also evidently willing to embrace the opportunity of\r\nentering an American protest against the doctrines which had been\r\npromulgated in the manifestoes of the recent congresses of the European\r\nsovereigns.\r\n\r\nTill the administration of Mr. Jefferson, it had been the custom of\r\nthe two houses to return answers to the annual messages of the\r\nPresident. These answers furnished Congress with the means of\r\nresponding to the executive suggestions. As much time was often\r\nconsumed in debating these answers, (a consumption of time not\r\ndirectly leading to any legislative result,) and as differences in\r\nopinion between Congress and the executive, if they existed, were thus\r\nprematurely developed, it was thought a matter of convenience, when Mr.\r\nJefferson came into power, to depart from the usage. But though\r\nattended with evils, it had its advantages. The opportunity of general\r\npolitical debate, under a government like ours, if not furnished,\r\nwill be taken. The constituencies look to their representatives to\r\ndiscuss public questions. It will perhaps be found, on comparing\r\nthe proceedings of Congress at the present day with what they were\r\nfifty years ago, that, although the general debate on the answer to\r\nthe President's message has been retrenched, there is in the course\r\nof the session quite as much discussion of topics incidentally\r\nbrought in, and often to the serious obstruction of the public\r\nbusiness, at the advanced stages of the session.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of this as a general principle, President\r\nMonroe, as we have seen, having in two successive annual messages called\r\nthe attention of Congress to this subject, Mr. Webster, by way of\r\nresponse to these allusions, at an early period of the session offered\r\nthe following resolution in the House of Representatives:--\r\n\r\n  \"_Resolved_, That provision ought to be made by law for defraying\r\n  the expense incident to the appointment of an agent or commissioner\r\n  to Greece, whenever the President shall deem it expedient to make\r\n  such appointment.\"\r\n\r\nHis speech in support of this resolution was delivered on the 19th of\r\nJanuary, 1824, in the presence of an immense audience, brought together\r\nby the interesting nature of the subject and by the fame of the speaker,\r\nnow returned, after six years' absence, to the field where he had\r\ngathered early laurels, and to which he had now come back with greatly\r\naugmented reputation. The public expectation was highly excited; and it\r\nis but little to say, that it was entirely fulfilled. The speech was\r\nconceived and executed with rare felicity; and was as remarkable for\r\nwhat it did not, as for what it did contain. To a subject on which it\r\nwas almost impossible to avoid a certain strain of classical sentiment,\r\nMr. Webster brought a chastened taste and a severe logic. He indulged in\r\nno _ad captandum_ reference to the topics which lay most obviously in\r\nhis way. A single allusion to Greece, as the mistress of the world in\r\nletters and arts, found an appropriate place in the exordium. But he\r\nneither rhapsodized about the ancients, nor denounced the Turks, nor\r\noverflowed with Americanism. He treated, in a statesmanlike manner, what\r\nhe justly called \"the great political question of the age,\" the question\r\n\"between absolute and regulated governments,\" and the duty of the United\r\nStates on fitting occasions to let their voice be heard on this\r\nquestion. He concisely reviewed the doctrines of the Continental\r\nsovereigns, as set forth in what has been called \"the Holy Alliance,\"\r\nand in the manifestoes of several successive congresses. He pointed out\r\nthe inconsistency of these principles with those of self-government and\r\nnational independence, and the duty of the United States to declare\r\ntheir sentiments in support of the latter. He showed that such a\r\ndeclaration was inconsistent with no principle of public law, and\r\nforbidden by no prudential consideration. He briefly sketched the\r\nhistory of the Greek revolution; and having shown that his proposal was\r\na pacific measure, both as regards the Turkish government and the\r\nEuropean allies, he took leave of the subject with a few manly words of\r\nsympathy for the Greeks.\r\n\r\nHe was supported by several leading members of the House,--by Mr. Clay,\r\nMr. Stevenson of Virginia, afterwards Speaker of the House and Minister\r\nto England, and by General Houston of Tennessee; but the subject lay too\r\nfar beyond the ordinary range of legislation; it gained no strength from\r\nthe calculations of any of the Presidential candidates; it enlisted none\r\nof the great local interests of the country; and it was not of a nature\r\nto be pushed against opposition or indifference. It was probably with\r\nlittle or no expectation of carrying it, that the resolution was moved\r\nby Mr. Webster. His object was gained in the opportunity of expressing\r\nhimself upon the great political question of the day. His words of\r\nencouragement were soon read in every capital and at every court of\r\nEurope, and in every Continental language; they were received with\r\ngrateful emotion in Greece. At home the speech fully sustained Mr.\r\nWebster's reputation, not merely for parliamentary talent, but for an\r\nacquaintance with general politics, which few public men in the United\r\nStates give themselves the trouble to acquire,--even among those who are\r\nselected to represent the country abroad. In a letter from Mr. Jeremiah\r\nMason, a person whose judgment on a matter of this kind was entitled to\r\nas much respect as that of any man in the community, this speech is\r\npronounced \"the best sample of parliamentary eloquence and statesmanlike\r\nreasoning which our country can show.\"\r\n\r\nIt was during this session, that Mr. Webster made his great argument\r\nin the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Gibbons and\r\nOgden, to which we have already alluded. It must increase the\r\nadmiration with which this great constitutional effort is read, to\r\nknow that the case came on in court a week or ten days earlier than Mr.\r\nWebster expected, and that it was late in the afternoon, after a\r\nsevere debate in the House of Representatives on some of the details\r\nof the tariff bill, that he received the intimation that he must be\r\nready to go into court and argue the cause the next morning. At this\r\ntime his brief was not drawn out; and the statement of the argument,\r\nthe selecting of the authorities, and the final digest of his\r\nmaterials, whether of reasoning or fact, were to be the work of the\r\nfew intervening hours. It is superfluous to say that there was no long\r\nspace for rest or sleep; though it seems hardly credible that the only\r\nspecific premeditation of such an argument before such a tribunal\r\nshould have been in the stolen watches of one night.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this session Mr. Webster, besides taking a leading\r\npart in the discussion of the details of the tariff law of 1824, made\r\na carefully prepared speech, in reply to Mr. Clay, on some of the\r\nprinciples upon which he had supported it. His exposition of the\r\npopular errors on the subject of the balance of trade may be referred\r\nto as a very happy specimen of philosophical reasoning applied to\r\ncommercial questions. Mr. Webster did not contest the constitutional\r\nright of Congress to lay duties for the protection of manufactures.\r\nHe opposed the bill on grounds of expediency, drawn from the condition\r\nof the country at the time, and from the unfriendly bearing of some of\r\nits provisions on the navigating interests. He was the representative\r\nof the principal commercial city of New England. The great majority of\r\nhis constituents were opposed to the bill; one member only from\r\nMassachusetts voted in its favor. The last sentence of the speech\r\nshows the general view which he took of the provisions of the act as a\r\nwhole: \"There are some parts of this bill which I highly approve; there\r\nare others in which I should acquiesce; but those to which I have now\r\nstated my objections appear to me so destitute of all justice, so\r\nburdensome and so dangerous to that interest which has steadily\r\nenriched, gallantly defended, and proudly distinguished us, that nothing\r\ncan prevail upon me to give it my support.\" This sentence sufficiently\r\nshows with how little justice it was asserted, in 1828, that Mr.\r\nWebster had, in 1824, declared an uncompromising hostility to all\r\nlegislative provision for the encouragement and protection of\r\nmanufactures.\r\n\r\nNo subject of great popular interest came up for debate in the second\r\nsession of the Eighteenth Congress, but the attention of Mr. Webster, as\r\nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, was assiduously devoted to a\r\nsubject of great practical importance; brought forward entirely without\r\nostentation or display, but inferior in interest to scarce any act of\r\nlegislation since the first organization of the government. We refer to\r\nthe act of the 3d of March, 1825, \"more effectually to provide for the\r\npunishment of certain crimes against the United States, and for other\r\npurposes.\" This chapter in the legislation of the United States had been\r\ncomparatively overlooked. The original act of the 30th of April, 1790,\r\n\"for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States,\"\r\ndeserves, in common with much of the legislation of the First Congress,\r\nthe praise of great sagacity and foresight in anticipating the wants and\r\nthe operation of the new system of government. Still, however, there was\r\na class of cases, arising out of the complex nature of our system, and\r\nthe twofold jurisdiction existing in the United States, which, being\r\nentirely novel in the history of other governments, was scarcely to be\r\nprovided for in advance. The analysis of the English constitution here\r\nfailed the able men upon whom it devolved to put the new system of\r\ngovernment in operation. It is to be wondered at, not that some things\r\nwere overlooked, but that so many were provided for.\r\n\r\nOf the cases left thus unprovided for, more perhaps were to be found in\r\nthe judiciary department than in any other. Many crimes committed on\r\nshipboard, beyond the jurisdiction of any State, or in places within the\r\nUnion excepted from State jurisdiction, were unprovided for. Statutes\r\nhad been enacted from time to time to supply these deficiencies; but the\r\nsubject does not appear at any time to have attracted the special\r\nattention of any one whose professional knowledge and weight of\r\ncharacter qualified him to propose a remedy. It was at length taken up\r\nby Mr. Webster, in the second session of the Eighteenth Congress. It\r\nfell appropriately within the sphere of the Committee on the Judiciary,\r\nof which he was chairman; and his own extensive practice in the courts\r\nboth of the United States and of the separate States had made him well\r\nacquainted with the defects of the existing laws. He accordingly drew\r\nup what finally passed the two houses, as the sixty-fifth chapter of the\r\nlaws of the second session of the Eighteenth Congress, and procured the\r\nassent of the Committee on the Judiciary to report it to the House. Some\r\namendments of no great moment were made to it on its passage, partly on\r\nthe motion of Mr. Webster himself; and partly on the suggestion of other\r\nmembers of the House. As it finally passed, in twenty-six sections, it\r\ncovered all the cases which had occurred in the thirty-five years which\r\nhad elapsed since the law of 1790 was enacted; and it amounted to a\r\nbrief, but comprehensive, code of the criminal jurisprudence of the\r\nUnited States, as distinct from that of the separate States.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Webster's object in this statute, not to enact theoretical\r\nreforms, but to remedy practical evils; to make provision for crimes\r\nwhich, for want of jurisdiction, had hitherto gone unpunished. It was\r\nobjected to the bill, on its passage through the House, that it created\r\na considerable number of capital offences. But these were already, in\r\nevery case, capital offences either at common law or by the criminal law\r\nof the States, whenever the State tribunals were competent to take\r\ncognizance of them. It was the effect of Mr. Webster's act, not to\r\ncreate new offences, but to bring within the reach of a proper tribunal\r\ncrimes recognized as such by all the codes of law, but which had\r\nhitherto escaped with impunity between separate jurisdictions. The bill\r\nwas received with great favor by the House. Mr. Buchanan said that he\r\nhighly approved its general features. \"It was a disgrace,\" he added, \"to\r\nour system of laws, that no provision had ever been made for the\r\npunishment of the crimes which it embraced, when committed in places\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States.\" An eloquent argument was\r\nmade by Mr. Livingston of Louisiana in favor of substituting lower\r\npenalties for capital punishment, but he failed to satisfy the House of\r\nthe expediency of so great a revolution in our criminal jurisprudence.\r\nSome slight modifications of the bill were conceded to the sensitiveness\r\nof those who apprehended encroachment on State jurisdiction; but it\r\npassed substantially in the form in which it was reported by Mr.\r\nWebster. Twenty-seven years' experience have shown it to be one of the\r\nmost valuable laws in the statute-book.\r\n\r\nAt this session of Congress the election of a President of the United\r\nStates devolved upon the House of Representatives, in default of a\r\npopular choice. The votes of the electoral colleges were ninety-nine for\r\nGeneral Jackson, eighty-four for Mr. Adams, forty-one for Mr. Crawford,\r\nand thirty-seven for Mr. Clay. This was the second time since the\r\nadoption of the Constitution, in 1789, that such an event had occurred.\r\nThe other case was in 1801, and under the Constitution in its original\r\nform, which required the electoral colleges to vote for two persons,\r\nwithout designating which of the two was to be President, and which\r\nVice-President, the choice between the two to be decided by plurality.\r\nThe Republican candidates, Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, having\r\nreceived each an equal number of votes, it devolved upon the House of\r\nRepresentatives to designate one of them as President. The Constitution\r\nwas immediately amended so as to require the candidates for the two\r\noffices to be designated as such in the electoral colleges; so that\r\nprecisely such a case as that of 1801 can never recur. In 1824, however,\r\nno person having received a majority of all the votes, it became\r\nnecessary for the House to choose a President from among the three\r\ncandidates having the highest number. On these occasions the House\r\nvotes, not _per capita_, but by States, the delegation of each State\r\nchoosing its teller. Mr. Webster was appointed teller for the\r\nMassachusetts delegation. The number of States was twenty-four, and the\r\ntellers were seated in parties of twelve at two tables. Mr. Webster was\r\nappointed by the tellers at one of the tables to announce the result of\r\nthe balloting; Mr. Randolph was appointed to the same service at the\r\nother table. The result was declared to be, for Mr. Adams thirteen\r\nvotes, for General Jackson seven, and for Mr. Crawford four. The votes\r\nof most of the States were matters of confident calculation beforehand;\r\nthose of Maryland and New York were in some degree doubtful. The former\r\nwas supposed to depend upon the decision of Mr. Warfield; the latter on\r\nthat of General Van Rensselaer. Mr. Webster possessed the political\r\nconfidence of both these gentlemen; and is believed to have exerted a\r\ndecisive influence in leading them to vote for Mr. Adams.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster had been elected to the Nineteenth Congress in the\r\nautumn of 1824, by a vote of four thousand nine hundred and ninety out\r\nof five thousand votes cast, the nearest approach to unanimity in a\r\nCongressional election, perhaps, that ever took place. The session\r\nwhich began in December, 1825, was of course the first session under\r\nMr. Adams's administration. The brief armistice in party warfare\r\nwhich existed under Mr. Monroe was over. The friends of General Jackson\r\n_en masse_, most of the friends of Mr. Crawford, and a portion of those\r\nof Mr. Clay, joined in a violent opposition to the new administration.\r\nIt would be impossible in this place to unfold the griefs, the\r\ninterests, the projects, the jealousies, and the mutual struggles, of\r\nthe leaders and the factions, who, with no community of political\r\nprinciple, entered into this warfare. The absence of any well-defined\r\ndivision of parties, like that which had formerly existed, gave wide\r\nscope to personal intrigue and sectional preference. Although,\r\nestimated in reference to individual suffrages, Mr. Adams had\r\nreceived a popular majority; and although he was selected from the\r\nthree highest candidates by an absolute majority of the States\r\nvoting in the House of Representatives, and by a very large plurality\r\nover both his competitors, yet, as General Jackson had received a\r\nsmall plurality of votes in the electoral colleges (but a little\r\nmore, however, than a third part of the entire electoral vote), he\r\nstood before the masses as a candidate wrongfully deprived of the place\r\nto which he was designated by the popular choice. Great sensibility\r\nwas evinced at this defeat of the \"Will of the People\"; and none\r\nseemed to feel the wrong more than a portion of the friends of that\r\none of the three candidates who had received the smallest vote, but\r\nwhom there had been, nevertheless, a confident hope of electing in the\r\nHouse. The prejudice against Mr. Adams arising from this source\r\nderived strength from the widely circulated calumny of a corrupt\r\nunderstanding between him and Mr. Clay. The bare suspicion of an\r\narrangement between party leaders to help each other into office,\r\nhowever groundless in point of fact, and however disproved by all the\r\ntestimony which could be brought to bear on a negative proposition, was\r\nsufficient seriously to affect the popularity of both parties.\r\n\r\nGreat talent, the amplest civil experience, and the purest patriotism\r\nare an inadequate basis of strength for an administration. If the\r\ncapricious and ill-defined element of what is called popularity is\r\nwanting, all else is of little avail. Mr. Adams's administration was\r\nconducted with the highest ability; it was incorruptible; it was\r\nfrugal; it was tolerant of opponents to its own injury. With the\r\nexception of half a dozen editors of newspapers warmly opposed to the\r\nadministration, from whom the trifling privilege of printing the\r\nlaws was withdrawn, no one was removed from office for political\r\nopinion. But the administration was unpopular, and was doomed from its\r\nformation. It was supported by very able men in both houses of\r\nCongress, and of these Mr. Webster was by all acknowledgment the chief.\r\nBut it failed to command the confidence of a numerical majority of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe leading measure of the first session of the Nineteenth Congress was\r\nthe Congress of Panama. Mr. Adams had announced in his message at the\r\ncommencement of the session, that an invitation to the congress had been\r\naccepted, and that \"ministers on the part of the United States would be\r\ncommissioned to attend its deliberations.\" In announcing this purpose,\r\nit is probable that the President regarded himself as within the\r\nordinary limits of executive discretion. The power of nominating\r\nambassadors and other public ministers is given by the Constitution to\r\nthe President alone. No laws for the establishment of any particular\r\nmissions have ever been passed, nor has any control been exercised over\r\nthem by Congress beyond determining the salaries of the ministers of\r\ndifferent ranks, and making the annual appropriations for their payment.\r\nThe executive is manifestly the sole depositary of the knowledge of the\r\nforeign relations of the country which is necessary to determine what\r\nmissions ought to be established. Notwithstanding these obvious\r\nconsiderations and constitutional principles, the novel and anomalous\r\ncharacter of the proposed Congress afforded a temptation to the\r\nopposition too strong to be resisted. The President's announcement\r\nformed the great point of attack during the first session of the new\r\nCongress. The confirmation of the ministers was vigorously resisted in\r\nthe Senate, and the resolution declaring the expediency of making the\r\nrequisite appropriations as strenuously opposed in the House. The\r\nmischiefs likely to result from the public discussion of the measure\r\nshowed the wisdom of those constitutional provisions on which the\r\nPresident had acted. The opposition, in denying that the executive\r\ncontrol of foreign relations is exclusive, showed at any rate that it\r\nought to be, at least as far as it is made so by the Constitution. After\r\na lapse of twenty-six years, we can scarcely believe that any doubt\r\nshould have existed, on the part of men of judgment and discretion, that\r\nsound policy required that the United States should be present at such a\r\ngeneral conference of the American powers; if for no other reason, to\r\nobserve their movements. But all the motives for such a course could not\r\nbe avowed, and of those that could, a part of the force was weakened by\r\nthe avowal. The influence of the United States was impaired in order\r\nthat the administration might be distressed.\r\n\r\nThe subject was discussed with great ability in both houses. The greater\r\nportion of the senatorial debate was with closed doors. Mr. Webster's\r\nspeech in the House is far the ablest of those published. It raised the\r\nquestion from the wretched level of party politics to the elevation of\r\nreal statesmanship. It discussed the constitutional question with a\r\nclearness and power which make us wonder that it was ever raised; and it\r\nunfolded the true nature of the proposed congress, as viewed in the\r\nlight of the public law. A very important topic of the speech was an\r\nexplanation of the declaration of President Monroe, in his annual\r\nmessage of 1823, against the interposition of the governments of Europe\r\nfor the purpose of enabling Spain to resubjugate her former colonial\r\npossessions on this continent. Mr. Webster pointed out the circumstances\r\nwhich warranted at the time the opinion that such interposition might be\r\nattempted; and he stated the important fact, not before known, that the\r\npurpose on the part of the United States to resist it was deliberately\r\nand unanimously formed by Mr. Monroe's cabinet, consisting at that time\r\nof Messrs. Adams, Crawford, Calhoun, Southard, and Wirt. The principles\r\nassumed in the debate on the Panama mission by the friends of Messrs.\r\nCrawford and Calhoun were greatly at variance with the spirit and\r\ntendency of the declaration, as they were with what has more recently\r\nbeen regarded as the true Democratic doctrine in reference to the\r\nrelations of the United States to her sister republics on this\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nThe speech on the Panama question was the most considerable effort made\r\nby Mr. Webster in the Nineteenth Congress. In the interval of the two\r\nsessions, in November, 1826, he was reelected with but a show of\r\nopposition. The eulogy upon Adams and Jefferson, of which we have\r\nalready spoken, was delivered in the month of August of this year. In\r\nthe month of June, 1827, Mr. Webster was elected to the Senate of the\r\nUnited States by a large majority of the votes of the two houses of the\r\nlegislature of Massachusetts, the Hon. Mr. Mills of Northampton, who had\r\nfilled that station with great ability, having declined being a\r\ncandidate for reelection in consequence of ill health.\r\n\r\nThe principal measure which occupied the attention of the two houses\r\nduring the first session of the Twentieth Congress was the revision of\r\nthe tariff. This measure had its origin in the distressed condition of\r\nthe woollen interest, which found itself deprived (partly by the effect\r\nof the repeal of the duty on wool imported into Great Britain) of that\r\nmeasure of protection which the tariff law of 1824 was designed to\r\nafford. An unsuccessful attempt had been made at the last session of\r\nCongress, to pass a law exclusively for the relief of the woollen\r\nmanufacturers; but no law having in view the protection of any one great\r\ninterest is likely to be enacted by Congress, however called for by the\r\nparticular circumstances of the case. At the present session an entire\r\nrevision of the tariff was attempted. Political considerations\r\nunfortunately could not be excluded from the arrangements of the bill. A\r\nmajority of the two houses was in favor of protection; but in a country\r\nso extensive as the United States, and embracing such a variety of\r\ninterests, there were different views among the friends of the policy as\r\nto the articles to be protected and the amount of protection. This\r\ndiversity of opinions and supposed diversity of interests enabled those\r\nwholly opposed to the principle and policy of protection, by uniting\r\ntheir votes on questions of detail with members who represented local\r\ninterests, to render the bill objectionable in many parts to several of\r\nits friends, and to reduce them to the alternative of either voting\r\nagainst it, or tolerating more or less which they deemed inexpedient,\r\nand even highly injurious. Hence it received the name of the \"Bill of\r\nAbominations.\"\r\n\r\nThe political motives alluded to caused the bill to be made as\r\nacceptable as possible to Pennsylvania and the other Middle States, and\r\nas unfavorable as possible to the leading interests of New England. The\r\ndepression of the woollen manufactures had originally caused the\r\nrevision of the tariff at this session. A heavy duty on the raw material\r\nwas one of the features of the bill. But this was represented as due to\r\nthe agricultural interest. The East, although it had now become\r\neminently a manufacturing region, was still the seat of an active\r\ncommerce, and largely concerned in the fisheries. The duty on molasses,\r\na great article of consumption with the mariners and fishermen of the\r\nEast, both in its natural form and that of cheap spirits, was doubled;\r\nbut this, it was said, was required for the benefit of the grain-growers\r\nof the Middle States. Other provisions of this kind were introduced into\r\nthe bill, in all cases with the assistance of the votes of its\r\nopponents, given in such a way as to render the bill as unpalatable as\r\npossible to the Northeastern manufacturers. Mr. Webster addressed the\r\nSenate, while the bill was before that body, exposing the objectionable\r\nfeatures to which we have alluded. Believing, however, that the great\r\narticle of woollens required the protection given it by the bill, and\r\nregarding the general system of protection as the established policy of\r\nthe country and of the government, and feeling that the capital which\r\nhad been invited into manufactures by former acts of legislation was now\r\nentitled to be sustained against the glut of foreign markets, fraudulent\r\ninvoices, and the competition of foreign labor working at starvation\r\nwages, he gave his vote for the bill, and has ever since supported the\r\npolicy of moderate protection. He has been accused of inconsistency in\r\nthis respect; and by none more earnestly than by the friends of Mr.\r\nCalhoun, who was one of those influential statesmen of the South by\r\nwhom, in the Fourteenth Congress, the foundation of a protective tariff\r\nwas laid on the corner-stone of the square-yard duty on domestic cotton\r\nfabrics. But he has been sustained by the great majority of his\r\nconstituents and of the people of the Northern, Middle, and Northwestern\r\nStates; and should the prospects of success be fulfilled with which\r\nmanufactures have been attempted at the South, there is little doubt\r\nthat she will at length perceive that her own interest would be promoted\r\nby upholding the same policy.\r\n\r\nWhen the speech of Mr. Webster of 1824, in which he assigned his reasons\r\nfor voting against the tariff law of that year, is carefully compared\r\nwith his speech of 1828, just referred to, it will be found that there\r\nis no other diversity than that which was induced by the change in the\r\nstate of the country itself in reference to its manufacturing interests,\r\nand by the course pursued in reference to the details of the bill by\r\nthose opposed to protection _in toto_. It is the best proof of this,\r\nthat, in the former edition of Mr. Webster's works, the two speeches\r\nwere, for more easy comparison, placed side by side.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [11] See North American Review, Vol. XVII. p. 414.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  Election of General Jackson.--Debate on Foot's Resolution.--Subject\r\n  of the Resolution, and Objects of its Mover.--Mr. Hayne's First\r\n  Speech.--Mr. Webster's original Participation in the Debate\r\n  unpremeditated.--His First Speech.--Reply of Mr. Hayne with\r\n  increased Asperity.--Mr. Webster's Great Speech.--Its Threefold\r\n  Object.--Description of the Manner of Mr. Webster in the Delivery\r\n  of this Speech, from Mr. March's \"Reminiscences of\r\n  Congress.\"--Reception of his Speech throughout the Country.--The\r\n  Dinner at New York.--Chancellor Kent's Remarks.--Final Disposal\r\n  of Foot's Resolution.--Report of Mr. Webster's Speech.--Mr.\r\n  Healey's Painting.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the interval between the two sessions of the Twentieth Congress, the\r\nPresidential election was decided. Mr. Adams and General Jackson were\r\nthe opposing candidates; and the latter was chosen by a large popular\r\nmajority. This result was brought about by the active cooeperation with\r\nGeneral Jackson's original supporters of the friends of Mr. Calhoun, and\r\nmany of the friends of the other candidates of 1824. This cooeperation\r\nimplied the combination of the most discordant materials, which did not,\r\nhowever, prevent its members during the canvass from heaping the\r\nbitterest reproaches upon Mr. Adams's administration for receiving the\r\nsupport of Mr. Clay. That there was no cordiality among the component\r\nelements of the party by which General Jackson was elevated to the chair\r\nwas soon quite apparent.\r\n\r\nThe first session of the Twenty-first Congress, that of 1829-30, is\r\nrendered memorable in the history of Mr. Webster, as well as in the\r\nparliamentary history of the country, by what has been called the debate\r\non Foot's resolution, in which Mr. Webster delivered the speech which is\r\nusually regarded as his ablest, and which may probably with truth be\r\npronounced the most celebrated speech ever delivered in Congress. The\r\ngreat importance of this effort will no doubt be considered as a\r\nsufficient reason for relating somewhat in detail the circumstances\r\nunder which it was made.\r\n\r\nThe debate arose in the following manner.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of December, 1829, Mr. Foot, one of the Senators from\r\nConnecticut, moved the following resolution:--\r\n\r\n  \"_Resolved_, That the Committee on Public Lands be instructed to\r\n  inquire and report the quantity of public lands remaining unsold\r\n  within each State and Territory, and whether it be expedient to\r\n  limit for a certain period the sales of the public lands to such\r\n  lands only as have heretofore been offered for sale, and are now\r\n  subject to entry at the _minimum_ price. And, also, whether the\r\n  office of Surveyor-General, and some of the land offices, may not be\r\n  abolished without detriment to the public interest.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to believe that, in bringing forward this resolution,\r\nMr. Foot acted in concert with any other member of the Senate. When it\r\ncame up for consideration the next day, the mover stated that he had\r\nbeen induced to offer the resolution from having at the last session\r\nexamined the report of the Commissioner of the Land Office, from which\r\nit appeared that the quantity of land remaining unsold at the _minimum_\r\nprice of one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre exceeded seventy-two\r\nmillions of acres; while it appeared from the commissioner's report at\r\nthis session, that the annual demand was not likely to exceed a million\r\nof acres at present, although of course it might be expected somewhat to\r\nincrease with the growth of the population.\r\n\r\nThis resolution, though one of inquiry only, was resisted. It was\r\nrepresented by Mr. Benton of Missouri as a resolution to inquire into\r\nthe expediency of committing a great injury upon the new States of the\r\nWest. Mr. Holmes of Maine supported the resolution, as one of inquiry\r\ninto an important subject. Mr. Foot disclaimed every purpose unfriendly\r\nto the West, and at the close of the conversation (in which Mr. Webster\r\ntook no part), it was agreed that the consideration of the resolution\r\nshould be postponed to the 11th of January, and made the special order\r\nof the day for that day. In this manner, it often happens that a\r\nresolution of inquiry on a business question of no urgent importance,\r\nintended to have no political bearing, and brought forward without\r\nconcert with others by an individual, becomes by delay the theme of\r\nimpassioned debates for weeks and months, to the serious obstruction of\r\nthe real business of Congress. In the present case, it must be admitted\r\nthat the loss of the public time thus occasioned was amply made up, by\r\nthe importance of the speech which has given celebrity to the debate.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of Mr. Foot's resolution was not resumed till\r\nWednesday, the 13th of January, when it was opposed by several Western\r\ngentlemen. It was next taken up on Monday, the 18th, when Mr. Benton of\r\nMissouri spoke at length against it. On Tuesday, the 19th, Mr. Holmes of\r\nMaine replied at no great length to Mr. Benton. Other members took some\r\npart in the debate, and then Mr. Hayne of South Carolina commenced a\r\nspeech, which occupied the rest of the day. Mr. Hayne was one of the\r\nyounger members of the Senate. He came forward in his native State in\r\n1814, when hardly of age, with great _eclat_, filled in rapid succession\r\nresponsible offices, and came to the Senate of the United States in\r\n1823, with a reputation already brilliant, and rapidly increasing. He\r\nwas active and diligent in business, fluent, graceful, and persuasive as\r\na debater; of a sanguine and self-relying temper; shrinking from no\r\nantagonist, and disposed to take the part of a champion.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster, up to this time, had not participated in the debate, which\r\nhad in fact been rather a pointless affair, and was dragging its slow\r\nlength through the Senate, no one knew exactly to what purpose. It had\r\nas yet assumed no character in which it invited or required his\r\nattention. He was much engaged at the time in the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States. The important case of John Jacob Astor and the State of\r\nNew York, in which he was of counsel, was to come on for argument on the\r\n20th of January; and on that day the argument of the case was in fact\r\ncommenced.[12] Leaving the court-room when the court adjourned on\r\nTuesday, the 19th, Mr. Webster came into the Senate in season to hear\r\nthe greater part of Mr. Hayne's speech; and it was suggested to him by\r\nseveral friends, and among others by Mr. Bell of New Hampshire, Mr.\r\nChambers of Maryland, and his colleague, Mr. Silsbee, that an immediate\r\nanswer to Mr. Hayne was due from him. The line of discussion pursued by\r\nthe Senator from South Carolina was such as to require, if not to\r\nprovoke, an immediate answer from the North. Mr. Webster accordingly\r\nrose when Mr. Hayne took his seat, but gave way to a motion for\r\nadjournment from Mr. Benton. These circumstances will sufficiently show\r\nhow entirely without premeditation, and with what preoccupation by other\r\ntrains of thought, Mr. Webster was led into this great intellectual\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nHe appeared in the Senate the next morning, Wednesday, January 20th,\r\nand Mr. Foot's resolution, being called up, was modified, on the\r\nsuggestion of Messrs. Sprague of Maine and Woodbury of New Hampshire, by\r\nadding the following clause:--\r\n\r\n  \"Or whether it be expedient to adopt measures to hasten the sales\r\n  and extend more rapidly the surveys of the public lands.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Webster immediately proceeded with the debate. No elaborate\r\npreparation, of course, could have been made by him, as the speech\r\nof Mr. Hayne, to which his reply was mainly directed, was delivered\r\nthe day before. He vindicated the government, under its successive\r\nadministrations, from the general charge of having managed the public\r\nlands in a spirit of hostility to the Western States. He particularly\r\ndefended New England against the accusation of hostility to the West.\r\nA passage in this part of his speech, contrasting Ohio as she was in\r\n1794 with the Ohio of 1830, will compare advantageously with any thing\r\nin these volumes. In speaking of the settlement of the West, Mr. Webster\r\nintroduced with just commendation the honored name of Nathan Dane, as\r\nthe author of the Ordinance of 1787, for the organization and\r\ngovernment of the territory northwest of the Ohio. He maintained that\r\nevery measure of legislation beneficial to the West had been carried\r\nin Congress by the aid of New England votes, and he closed by an\r\nallusion to his own course as uniformly friendly to that part of the\r\nUnion. Mr. Benton followed Mr. Webster, and commenced a speech in\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Thursday, the 21st, the subject again came up, and it was\r\nnow evident that the debate had put on a new character. Its real\r\ninterest and importance were felt to be commencing. Mr. Chambers\r\nexpressed the hope that the Senate would consent to postpone the further\r\nconsideration of the resolution till the next Monday, as Mr. Webster,\r\nwho had engaged in the discussion and wished to be present when it\r\nshould be resumed, had pressing engagements out of the house, and could\r\nnot conveniently give his attendance in the Senate before Monday.[13]\r\nMr. Hayne said \"he saw the gentleman from Massachusetts in his seat, and\r\npresumed he could make an arrangement which would enable him to be\r\npresent here, during the discussion to-day. He was unwilling that this\r\nsubject should be postponed before he had an opportunity of replying to\r\nsome of the observations which had fallen from that gentleman yesterday.\r\nHe would not deny that some things had fallen from him which rankled[14]\r\nhere (touching his breast), from which he would desire at once to\r\nrelieve himself. The gentleman had discharged his fire in the presence\r\nof the Senate. He hoped he would now afford him an opportunity of\r\nreturning the shot.\"\r\n\r\nThe manner in which this was said was not such as to soften the\r\nharshness of the sentiment. It will be difficult, in reverting to Mr.\r\nWebster's speech, to find either in its substance or spirit any adequate\r\ngrounds for the feeling manifested by Mr. Hayne. Nor would it probably\r\nbe easy in the history of Congress to find another case in which a\r\nsimilar act of accommodation in the way of postponing a subject has been\r\nrefused, at least on such a ground. Mr. Webster, in reply to Mr. Hayne's\r\nremark, that he wished without delay to return his shot, said, \"Let the\r\ndiscussion proceed; I am ready now to receive the gentleman's fire.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Benton then addressed the Senate for about an hour, in conclusion of\r\nthe speech which he had commenced the day before. At the close of Mr.\r\nBenton's argument, Mr. Bell of New Hampshire moved that the further\r\nconsideration of the subject should be postponed till Monday, but the\r\nmotion was negatived. Mr. Hayne then took the floor, and spoke for about\r\nan hour in reply to Mr. Webster's remarks of the preceding day. Before\r\nhe had concluded his argument, the Senate adjourned till Monday. On that\r\nday, January the 25th, he spoke for two hours and a half, and completed\r\nhis speech. Mr. Webster immediately rose to reply, but the day was far\r\nadvanced, and he yielded to a motion for adjournment.\r\n\r\nThe second speech of Mr. Hayne, to which Mr. Webster was now called\r\nupon to reply, was still more strongly characterized than the first\r\nwith severity, not to say bitterness, towards the Eastern States. The\r\ntone toward Mr. Webster personally was not courteous. It bordered on\r\nthe offensive. It was difficult not to find in both of the speeches of\r\nthe Senator from South Carolina the indication of a preconceived\r\npurpose to hold up New England, and Mr. Webster as her most\r\ndistinguished representative, to public odium. In his second speech, Mr.\r\nHayne reaffirmed and urged those constitutional opinions which are\r\nusually known as the doctrines of Nullification; that is to say, the\r\nassumed right of a State, when she deems herself oppressed by an\r\nunconstitutional act of Congress, to declare by State ordinance the\r\nact of Congress null and void, and discharge the citizens of the State\r\nfrom the duty of obedience.\r\n\r\nSuch being the character of Mr. Hayne's speech, Mr. Webster had three\r\nobjects to accomplish in his answer. The first was to repel the\r\npersonalities toward himself, which formed one of the most prominent\r\nfeatures of Mr. Hayne's speech. This object was accomplished by a few\r\nretaliatory strokes, in which the severest sarcasm was so mingled with\r\nunaffected good humor and manly expostulation, as to carry captive the\r\nsympathy of the audience. The vindication of the Eastern States\r\ngenerally, and of Massachusetts in particular, was the second object,\r\nand was pursued in a still higher strain. When it was finished, no one\r\nprobably regretted more keenly than the accomplished antagonist the easy\r\ncredence which he had lent to the purveyors of forgotten scandal, some\r\nof whom were present, and felt grateful for their obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe third and far the more important object with Mr. Webster was the\r\nconstitutional argument, in which he asserted the character of our\r\npolitical system as a government established by the people of the United\r\nStates, in contradistinction to a compact between the separate States;\r\nand exposed the fallacy of attempting to turn the natural right of\r\nrevolution against the government into a right reserved under the\r\nConstitution to overturn the government itself.\r\n\r\nSeveral chapters of the interesting work of Mr. March, already referred\r\nto,[15] are devoted to the subject of this debate; and we have thought\r\nthat we could in no way convey to the reader so just and distinct an\r\nimpression of the effect of Mr. Webster's speech at the time of its\r\ndelivery, as by borrowing largely from his animated pages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"It was on Tuesday, January the 26th, 1830,--a day to be hereafter for\r\never memorable in Senatorial annals,--that the Senate resumed the\r\nconsideration of Foot's resolution. There never was before, in the city,\r\nan occasion of so much excitement. To witness this great intellectual\r\ncontest, multitudes of strangers had for two or three days previous been\r\nrushing into the city, and the hotels overflowed. As early as 9 o'clock\r\nof this morning, crowds poured into the Capitol, in hot haste; at 12\r\no'clock, the hour of meeting, the Senate-chamber--its galleries, floor,\r\nand even lobbies--was filled to its utmost capacity. The very stairways\r\nwere dark with men, who clung to one another, like bees in a swarm.\r\n\r\n\"The House of Representatives was early deserted. An adjournment would\r\nhave hardly made it emptier. The Speaker, it is true, retained his\r\nchair, but no business of moment was, or could be, attended to. Members\r\nall rushed in to hear Mr. Webster, and no call of the House or other\r\nparliamentary proceedings could compel them back. The floor of the\r\nSenate was so densely crowded, that persons once in could not get out,\r\nnor change their position; in the rear of the Vice-Presidential\r\nchair, the crowd was particularly intense. Dixon H. Lewis, then a\r\nRepresentative from Alabama, became wedged in here. From his enormous\r\nsize, it was impossible for him to move without displacing a vast\r\nportion of the multitude. Unfortunately, too, for him, he was jammed\r\nin directly behind the chair of the Vice-President, where he could\r\nnot see, and hardly hear, the speaker. By slow and laborious effort,\r\npausing occasionally to breathe, he gained one of the windows, which,\r\nconstructed of painted glass, flank the chair of the Vice-President on\r\neither side. Here he paused, unable to make more headway. But\r\ndetermined to see Mr. Webster as he spoke, with his knife he made a\r\nlarge hole in one of the panes of the glass; which is still visible as\r\nhe made it. Many were so placed as not to be able to see the speaker\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\"The courtesy of Senators accorded to the fairer sex room on the\r\nfloor--the most gallant of them, their own seats. The gay bonnets and\r\nbrilliant dresses threw a varied and picturesque beauty over the scene,\r\nsoftening and embellishing it.\r\n\r\n\"Seldom, if ever, has speaker in this or any other country had more\r\npowerful incentives to exertion; a subject, the determination of which\r\ninvolved the most important interests, and even duration, of the\r\nrepublic; competitors, unequalled in reputation, ability, or position; a\r\nname to make still more glorious, or lose for ever; and an audience,\r\ncomprising not only persons of this country most eminent in intellectual\r\ngreatness, but representatives of other nations, where the art of\r\neloquence had flourished for ages. All the soldier seeks in opportunity\r\nwas here.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Webster perceived, and felt equal to, the destinies of the moment.\r\nThe very greatness of the hazard exhilarated him. His spirits rose with\r\nthe occasion. He awaited the time of onset with a stern and impatient\r\njoy. He felt like the war-horse of the Scriptures, who 'paweth in the\r\nvalley, and rejoiceth in his strength: who goeth on to meet the armed\r\nmen,--who saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha! and who smelleth the battle\r\nafar off, the thunder of the captains and the shouting.'\r\n\r\n\"A confidence in his own resources, springing from no vain estimate of\r\nhis power, but the legitimate offspring of previous severe mental\r\ndiscipline, sustained and excited him. He had gauged his opponents, his\r\nsubject, and _himself_.\r\n\r\n\"He was, too, at this period, in the very prime of manhood. He had\r\nreached middle age,--an era in the life of man when the faculties,\r\nphysical or intellectual, may be supposed to attain their fullest\r\norganization and most perfect development. Whatever there was in him of\r\nintellectual energy and vitality, the occasion, his full life, and high\r\nambition might well bring forth.\r\n\r\n\"He never rose on an ordinary occasion to address an ordinary audience\r\nmore self-possessed. There was no tremulousness in his voice nor manner;\r\nnothing hurried, nothing simulated. The calmness of superior strength\r\nwas visible everywhere; in countenance, voice, and bearing. A\r\ndeep-seated conviction of the extraordinary character of the emergency,\r\nand of his ability to control it, seemed to possess him wholly. If an\r\nobserver, more than ordinarily keen-sighted, detected at times something\r\nlike exultation in his eye, he presumed it sprang from the excitement of\r\nthe moment, and the anticipation of victory.\r\n\r\n\"The anxiety to hear the speech was so intense, irrepressible, and\r\nuniversal, that no sooner had the Vice-President assumed the chair, than\r\na motion was made, and unanimously carried, to postpone the ordinary\r\npreliminaries of Senatorial action, and to take up immediately the\r\nconsideration of the resolution.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Webster rose and addressed the Senate. His exordium is known by\r\nheart everywhere: 'Mr. President, when the mariner has been tossed, for\r\nmany days, in thick weather, and on an unknown sea, he naturally avails\r\nhimself of the first pause in the storm, the earliest glance of the sun,\r\nto take his latitude, and ascertain how far the elements have driven him\r\nfrom his true course. Let us imitate this prudence, and, before we float\r\nfarther on the waves of this debate, refer to the point from which we\r\ndeparted, that we may at least be able to conjecture where we now are. I\r\nask for the reading of the resolution before the Senate.'\r\n\r\n\"There wanted no more to enchain the attention. There was a spontaneous,\r\nthough silent, expression of eager approbation, as the orator concluded\r\nthese opening remarks. And while the clerk read the resolution, many\r\nattempted the impossibility of getting nearer the speaker. Every head\r\nwas inclined closer towards him, every ear turned in the direction of\r\nhis voice, and that deep, sudden, mysterious silence followed, which\r\nalways attends fulness of emotion. From the sea of upturned faces before\r\nhim, the orator beheld his thoughts reflected as from a mirror. The\r\nvarying countenance, the suffused eye, the earnest smile, the\r\never-attentive look, assured him of his audience's entire sympathy. If\r\namong his hearers there were those who affected at first an indifference\r\nto his glowing thoughts and fervent periods, the difficult mask was soon\r\nlaid aside, and profound, undisguised, devoted attention followed. In\r\nthe earlier part of his speech, one of his principal opponents seemed\r\ndeeply engrossed in the careful perusal of a newspaper he held before\r\nhis face; but this, on nearer approach, proved to be _upside down_. In\r\ntruth, all, sooner or later, voluntarily, or in spite of themselves,\r\nwere wholly carried away by the eloquence of the orator.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Those who had doubted Mr. Webster's ability to cope with and overcome\r\nhis opponents were fully satisfied of their error before he had\r\nproceeded far in his speech. Their fears soon took another direction.\r\nWhen they heard his sentences of powerful thought, towering in\r\naccumulative grandeur, one above the other, as if the orator strove,\r\nTitan-like, to reach the very heavens themselves, they were giddy with\r\nan apprehension that he would break down in his flight. They dared not\r\nbelieve that genius, learning, and intellectual endowment however\r\nuncommon, that was simply mortal, could sustain itself long in a career\r\nseemingly so perilous. They feared an Icarian fall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"What New England heart was there but throbbed with vehement,\r\ntumultuous, irrepressible emotion, as he dwelt upon New England\r\nsufferings, New England struggles, and New England triumphs during the\r\nwar of the Revolution? There was scarcely a dry eye in the Senate; all\r\nhearts were overcome; grave judges and men grown old in dignified life\r\nturned aside their heads, to conceal the evidences of their emotion.\r\n\r\n\"In one corner of the gallery was clustered a group of Massachusetts\r\nmen. They had hung from the first moment upon the words of the speaker,\r\nwith feelings variously but always warmly excited, deepening in\r\nintensity as he proceeded. At first, while the orator was going through\r\nhis exordium, they held their breath and hid their faces, mindful of the\r\nsavage attack upon him and New England, and the fearful odds against\r\nhim, her champion;--as he went deeper into his speech, they felt easier;\r\nwhen he turned Hayne's flank on Banquo's ghost, they breathed freer and\r\ndeeper. But now, as he alluded to Massachusetts, their feelings were\r\nstrained to the highest tension; and when the orator, concluding his\r\nencomium of the land of their birth, turned, intentionally or otherwise,\r\nhis burning eye full upon them, _they shed tears like girls_!\r\n\r\n\"No one who was not present can understand the excitement of the scene.\r\nNo one who was, can give an adequate description of it. No word-painting\r\ncan convey the deep, intense enthusiasm, the reverential attention, of\r\nthat vast assembly, nor limner transfer to canvas their earnest, eager,\r\nawe-struck countenances. Though language were as subtile and flexible as\r\nthought, it still would be impossible to represent the full idea of the\r\nscene. There is something intangible in an emotion, which cannot be\r\ntransferred. The nicer shades of feeling elude pursuit. Every\r\ndescription, therefore, of the occasion, seems to the narrator himself\r\nmost tame, spiritless, unjust.\r\n\r\n\"Much of the instantaneous effect of the speech arose, of course, from\r\nthe orator's delivery,--the tones of his voice, his countenance, and\r\nmanner. These die mostly with the occasion that calls them forth; the\r\nimpression is lost in the attempt at transmission from one mind to\r\nanother. They can only be described in general terms. 'Of the\r\neffectiveness of Mr. Webster's manner in many parts,' says Mr. Everett,\r\n'it would be in vain to attempt to give any one not present the faintest\r\nidea. It has been my fortune to hear some of the ablest speeches of the\r\ngreatest living orators on both sides of the water, but I must confess I\r\nnever heard any thing which so completely realized my conception of what\r\nDemosthenes was when he delivered the Oration for the Crown.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The variety of incident during the speech, and the rapid fluctuation of\r\npassions, kept the audience in continual expectation and ceaseless\r\nagitation. There was no chord of the heart the orator did not strike, as\r\nwith a master-hand. The speech was a complete drama of comic and\r\npathetic scenes; one varied excitement; laughter and tears gaining\r\nalternate victory.\r\n\r\n\"A great portion of the speech is strictly argumentative; an exposition\r\nof constitutional law. But grave as such portion necessarily is,\r\nseverely logical, abounding in no fancy or episode, it engrossed\r\nthroughout the undivided attention of every intelligent hearer.\r\nAbstractions, under the glowing genius of the orator, acquired a beauty,\r\na vitality, a power to thrill the blood and enkindle the affections,\r\nawakening into earnest activity many a dormant faculty. His ponderous\r\nsyllables had an energy, a vehemence of meaning in them, that\r\nfascinated, while they startled. His thoughts in their statuesque beauty\r\nmerely would have gained all critical judgment; but he realized the\r\nantique fable, and warmed the marble into life. There was a sense of\r\npower in his language,--of power withheld and suggestive of still\r\ngreater power,--that subdued, as by a spell of mystery, the hearts of\r\nall. For power, whether intellectual or physical, produces in its\r\nearnest development a feeling closely allied to awe. It was never more\r\nfelt than on this occasion. It had entire mastery. The sex which is\r\nsaid to love it best, and abuse it most, seemed as much or more carried\r\naway than the sterner one. Many who had entered the hall with light, gay\r\nthoughts, anticipating at most a pleasurable excitement, soon became\r\ndeeply interested in the speaker and his subject; surrendered him their\r\nentire heart; and when the speech was over, and they left the hall, it\r\nwas with sadder, perhaps, but surely with far more elevated and\r\nennobling emotions.\r\n\r\n\"The exulting rush of feeling with which he went through the peroration\r\nthrew a glow over his countenance, like inspiration. Eye, brow, each\r\nfeature, every line of the face, seemed touched, as with a celestial\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\"The swell and roll of his voice struck upon the ears of the spellbound\r\naudience, in deep and melodious cadence, as waves upon the shore of the\r\n'far-resounding' sea. The Miltonic grandeur of his words was the fit\r\nexpression of his thought, and raised his hearers up to his theme.\r\nHis voice, exerted to its utmost power, penetrated every recess or\r\ncorner of the Senate,--penetrated even the ante-rooms and stairways, as\r\nhe pronounced in deepest tones of pathos these words of solemn\r\nsignificance: 'When my eyes shall be turned to behold, for the last\r\ntime, the sun in heaven, may I not see him shining on the broken and\r\ndishonored fragments of a once glorious Union; on States dissevered,\r\ndiscordant, belligerent; on a land rent with civil feuds, or drenched,\r\nit may be, in fraternal blood! Let their last feeble and lingering\r\nglance rather behold the gorgeous ensign of the republic, now known\r\nand honored throughout the earth, still full high advanced, its arms\r\nand trophies streaming in their original lustre, not a stripe erased or\r\npolluted, nor a single star obscured, bearing for its motto, no such\r\nmiserable interrogatory as, \"What is all this worth?\" nor those other\r\nwords of delusion and folly, \"Liberty first and Union afterwards\";\r\nbut everywhere, spread all over in characters of living light, blazing\r\non all its ample folds, as they float over the sea and over the land,\r\nand in every wind under the whole heavens, that other sentiment, dear\r\nto every American heart,--LIBERTY AND UNION, NOW AND FOR EVER, ONE\r\nAND INSEPARABLE!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The speech was over, but the tones of the orator still lingered upon\r\nthe ear, and the audience, unconscious of the close, retained their\r\npositions. The agitated countenance, the heaving breast, the suffused\r\neye, attested the continued influence of the spell upon them. Hands\r\nthat, in the excitement of the moment, had sought each other, still\r\nremained closed in an unconscious grasp. Eye still turned to eye, to\r\nreceive and repay mutual sympathy; and everywhere around seemed\r\nforgetfulness of all but the orator's presence and words.\"--pp.\r\n132-148.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter having spoken about three hours on the 26th of January, Mr.\r\nWebster gave way for an adjournment. He resumed and concluded the speech\r\non the following day. During most of the time that he was speaking, Mr.\r\nHayne occupied himself in taking notes, and rose to reply at the\r\nconclusion of Mr. Webster's argument. An adjournment was proposed by one\r\nof Mr. Hayne's friends, but he wisely determined to terminate all that\r\nhe intended to say on the subject upon the spot. He accordingly\r\naddressed the Senate for about half an hour upon the constitutional\r\nquestion which formed the most important portion of Mr. Webster's\r\nspeech. These remarks of Mr. Hayne were, in the newspaper report,\r\nexpanded into an elaborate argument, which occupies nineteen pages in\r\nthe register of Congressional debates. When Mr. Hayne sat down, Mr.\r\nWebster, in turn, rose to make a brief rejoinder. \"The gentleman,\" said\r\nhe, \"has in vain attempted to reconstruct his shattered argument\"; and\r\nthis formidable exordium was followed up by a brief restatement of his\r\nown argument, which, for condensation, precision, and force, may be\r\nreferred to as a specimen of parliamentary logic never surpassed. The\r\nart of reasoning on moral questions can go no further.\r\n\r\nThus terminated the day's great work. In the evening the Senatorial\r\nchampions met at a friend's house, and exchanged those courteous\r\nsalutations which mitigate the asperity of political collision, and\r\nprevent the conflicts of party from embittering social life.\r\n\r\nThe sensation produced by the great debate on those who heard it was but\r\nthe earnest of its effect on the country at large. The length of Mr.\r\nWebster's speech did not prevent its being copied into the leading\r\nnewspapers throughout the country. It was the universal theme of\r\nconversation. Letters of acknowledgment and congratulation from the most\r\ndistinguished individuals, from politicians retired from active life,\r\nfrom entire strangers, from persons not sympathizing with all Mr.\r\nWebster's views, from distant parts of the Union, were addressed to him\r\nby every mail. Immense editions of the speech in a pamphlet form were\r\ncalled for. A proposal was made to the friends of Mr. Hayne to unite in\r\nthe publication of a joint edition of the two speeches for general\r\ncirculation throughout the country, but this offer was declined. Mr.\r\nWebster's friends in Boston published a pamphlet edition of the\r\nspeeches of Mr. Hayne and Mr. Webster. It is no exaggeration to say,\r\nthat throughout the country Mr. Webster's speech was regarded, not only\r\nas a brilliant and successful personal defence and a triumphant\r\nvindication of New England, but as a complete overthrow of the dangerous\r\nconstitutional heresies which had menaced the stability of the Union.\r\n\r\nIn this light it was looked upon by a large number of the most\r\ndistinguished citizens of New York, who took occasion to offer Mr.\r\nWebster the compliment of a public dinner the following winter.\r\nCircumstances delayed the execution of their purpose till some time had\r\nelapsed from the delivery of the speech, but the recollection of it was\r\nvivid, and it was referred to by Chancellor Kent, the president of the\r\nday, as the service especially demanding the grateful recognition of the\r\ncountry. After alluding to the debate on Foot's resolution and to the\r\ncharacter of Mr. Webster's speech, the venerable Chancellor added:--\r\n\r\n  \"The consequences of that discussion have been extremely beneficial.\r\n  It turned the attention of the public to the great doctrines of\r\n  national rights and national union. Constitutional law ceased to\r\n  remain wrapped up in the breasts, and taught only by the responses,\r\n  of the living oracles of the law. Socrates was said to have drawn\r\n  down philosophy from the skies, and scattered it among the schools.\r\n  It may with equal truth be said that constitutional law, by means of\r\n  those senatorial discussions and the master genius that guided them,\r\n  was rescued from the archives of our tribunals and the libraries of\r\n  our lawyers, and placed under the eye and submitted to the judgment\r\n  of the American people. _Their verdict is with us, and from it there\r\n  lies no appeal._\"[16]\r\n\r\nWith respect to Mr. Foot's resolution it may be observed, that it\r\ncontinued before the Senate a long time, a standing subject of\r\ndiscussion. One half at least of the members of the Senate took part in\r\nthe debate, which daily assumed a wider range and wandered farther from\r\nthe starting-point. Many speeches were made which, under other\r\ncircumstances, would have attracted notice, but the interest of the\r\ncontroversy expired with the great effort of the 26th and 27th of\r\nJanuary. At length, on the 21st of May, a motion for indefinite\r\npostponement, submitted by Mr. Webster at the close of his first\r\nspeech, prevailed, and thus the whole discussion ended.\r\n\r\nIt may be worthy of remark, that Mr. Webster's speech was taken in\r\nshort-hand by Mr. Gales, the veteran editor of the National\r\nIntelligencer, a stenographer of great experience and skill. It was\r\nwritten out in common hand by a member of his family, and sent to Mr.\r\nWebster for correction. It remained in his hands for that purpose a part\r\nof one day, and then went to the press.\r\n\r\nA young and gifted American artist,[17] whose talents had been largely\r\nput in requisition by King Louis Philippe to adorn the walls of\r\nVersailles, conceived a few years ago the happy idea of a grand\r\nhistorical picture of this debate. On a canvas of the largest size he\r\nhas nobly delineated the person of the principal individual in the act\r\nof replying to Mr. Hayne, with those of his colleagues in the Senate.\r\nThe passages and galleries of the Senate-Chamber are filled with\r\nattentive listeners of both sexes. Above a hundred accurate studies from\r\nlife give authenticity to a work in which posterity will find the\r\nsensible presentment of this great intellectual effort.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [12] This case is known as that of Carver's Lessees against John Jacob\r\n        Astor, and is reported in 4 Peters, I.\r\n\r\n   [13] Mr. Chambers referred to the case in court just mentioned, in\r\n        which Mr. Webster was engaged, and in which the argument had\r\n        already begun.\r\n\r\n   [14] Mr. Hayne subsequently disclaimed having used this word.\r\n\r\n   [15] Reminiscences of Congress.\r\n\r\n   [16] Chancellor Kent's remarks are given entire in the introduction to\r\n        Mr. Webster's Speech at the New York Dinner, Vol. I. p. 194.\r\n\r\n   [17] Mr. Geo.

In this interval the\r\ngovernment was administered for two successive terms by General Jackson,\r\nand for a single term by Mr. Van Buren. It was a period filled with\r\nincidents of great importance in various departments of the government,\r\noften of a startling character at the time, and not less frequently\r\nexerting a permanent influence on the condition of the country. It may\r\nbe stated as the general characteristic of the political tendencies of\r\nthis period, that there was a decided weakening of respect for\r\nconstitutional restraint. Vague ideas of executive discretion prevailed\r\non the one hand in the interpretation of the Constitution, and of\r\npopular sovereignty on the other, as represented by a President elevated\r\nto office by overwhelming majorities of the people. The expulsion of the\r\nIndian tribes from the Southern States, in violation of the faith of\r\ntreaties and in open disregard of the opinion of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States as to their obligation; the claim of a right on the\r\npart of a State to nullify an act of the general government; the\r\nviolation of the charter of the bank, and the Presidential veto of the\r\nact of Congress rechartering it; the deposit of the public money in the\r\nselected State banks with a view to its safe keeping and for the greater\r\nencouragement of trade by the loan of the public funds; the explosion\r\nof this system, and the adoption of one directly opposed to it, which\r\nrejected wholly the aid of the banks and denied the right of the\r\ngovernment to employ the public funds for any but fiscal purposes; the\r\nexecutive menaces of war against France; the unsuccessful attempt of Mr.\r\nVan Buren's administration to carry on the government upon General\r\nJackson's system; the panic of 1837, succeeded by the general uprising\r\nof the country and the universal demand for a change of men and\r\nmeasures,--these are the leading incidents in the chronicle of the\r\nperiod in question. Most of the events referred to are discussed in the\r\nfollowing volumes. On some of them Mr. Webster put forth all his power.\r\nThe questions pertaining to the construction of the Constitution, to the\r\nbank, to the veto power, to the currency, to the constitutionality of\r\nthe tariff, to the right of removal from office, and to the finances,\r\nwere discussed in almost every conceivable form, and with every variety\r\nof argument and illustration.\r\n\r\nIt has already been observed, that General Jackson was brought into\r\npower by a somewhat ill-compacted alliance between his original friends\r\nand a portion of the friends of the other candidates of 1824. As far as\r\nMr. Calhoun and his followers were concerned, the cordiality of the\r\nunion was gone before the inauguration of the new President. There was\r\nnot only on the list of the cabinet to be appointed no adequate\r\nrepresentative of the Vice-President, but his rival candidate for the\r\nsuccession (Mr. Van Buren) was placed at the head of the administration.\r\nThere is reason to suppose that General Jackson, who, though his policy\r\ntended greatly to impair the strength of the Union, was in feeling a\r\nwarm Unionist, witnessed with no dissatisfaction the result of the great\r\nconstitutional debate and its influence upon the country.\r\n\r\nBut the effect of this debate on the friendly relations of Mr.\r\nWebster with the administration was in some degree neutralized by the\r\nincidents of the second session of the Twenty-first Congress. Mr. Van\r\nBuren had retreated before the embarrassments of the position in which\r\nhe found himself in the Department of State, and had accepted the\r\nmission to England. The instructions which he had given to Mr.\r\nMcLane in 1829, in reference to the adjustment of the question\r\nrelative to the colonial trade, were deemed highly objectionable by a\r\nmajority of the Senate, as bringing the relations of our domestic\r\nparties to the notice of a foreign government, and founding upon a\r\nchange of administration an argument for the concession of what was\r\ndeemed and called \"a boon\" by the British government. In order to\r\nmark the spirit of these instructions with the disapprobation of the\r\nSenate, the nomination of Mr. Van Buren as Minister to England was\r\nnegatived by a majority of that body. While the subject was under\r\ndiscussion, Mr. Clay, Mr. Webster, and Mr. Calhoun took the same view\r\nof this delicate question. It will be found treated in the speech of Mr.\r\nWebster of the 24th of January, 1832, with all the gravity, temper, and\r\nmoderation which its importance demanded.\r\n\r\nIn the Twenty-second Congress (the second of General Jackson's\r\nadministration) the bank question became prominent. General Jackson had\r\nin his first message called the attention of Congress to the subject of\r\nthe bank. No doubt of its constitutionality was then intimated by him.\r\nIn the course of a year or two an attempt was made, on the part of the\r\nexecutive, to control the appointment of the officers of one of the\r\nEastern branches. This attempt was resisted by the bank, and from that\r\ntime forward a state of warfare, at first partially disguised, but\r\nfinally open and flagrant, existed between the government and the\r\ndirectors of the institution. In the first session of the Twenty-second\r\nCongress (1831-32), a bill was introduced by Mr. Dallas, and passed the\r\ntwo houses, to renew the charter of the bank. This measure was supported\r\nby Mr. Webster, on the ground of the importance of a national bank to\r\nthe fiscal operations of the government, and to the currency, exchange,\r\nand general business of the country. No specific complaints of\r\nmismanagement had then been made, nor were any abuses alleged to exist.\r\nThe bank was, almost without exception, popular at that time with the\r\nbusiness interests of the country, and particularly at the South and\r\nWest. Its credit in England was solid; its bills and drafts on London\r\ntook the place of specie for remittances to India and China. Its\r\nconvenience and usefulness were recognized in the report of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury (Mr. McLane), at the same time that its\r\nconstitutionality was questioned and its existence threatened by the\r\nPresident. So completely, however, was the policy of General Jackson's\r\nadministration the impulse of his own feelings and individual\r\nimpressions, and so imperfectly had these been disclosed on the present\r\noccasion, that the fate of the bill for rechartering the bank was a\r\nmatter of uncertainty on the part both of adherents and opponents. Many\r\npersons on both sides of the two houses were taken by surprise by the\r\nveto. When the same question was to be decided by General Washington, he\r\ntook the opinion in writing of every member of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nBut events of a different complexion soon occurred, and gave a new\r\ndirection to the thoughts of men throughout the country. The opposition\r\nof South Carolina to the protective policy had been pushed to a point of\r\nexcitement at which it was beyond the control of party leaders.\r\nAlthough, as we have seen, that policy had in 1816 been established by\r\nthe aid of distinguished statesmen of South Carolina, who saw in the\r\nsuccess of American cotton manufactures a new market for the staple of\r\nthe South, in which it would take the place of the cotton of India, the\r\nprotective policy at a later period had come to be generally considered\r\nunconstitutional at the South. A change of opinion somewhat similar had\r\ntaken place in New England, which had been originally opposed to this\r\npolicy, as adverse to the commercial and navigating interests.\r\nExperience gradually showed that such was not the case. The enactment of\r\nthe law of 1824 was considered as establishing the general principle of\r\nprotection as the policy of the country. It was known to be the policy\r\nof the great central States. The capital of the North was to some extent\r\nforced into new channels. Some branches of manufactures flourished, as\r\nskill was acquired and improvements in machinery made. The coarse cotton\r\nfabrics which had enjoyed the protection of the _minimum_ duty\r\nprospered, manufacturing villages grew up, the price of the fabric fell,\r\nand as competition increased the tariff did little more than protect the\r\ndomestic manufacturer from fraudulent invoices and the fluctuation of\r\nforeign markets. Thus all parties were benefited, not excepting the\r\nSouth, which gained a new customer for her staple. These changes in the\r\ncondition of things led Mr. Webster, as we have remarked in a former\r\nchapter, to modify his course on the tariff question.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no manufactures had been established at the South. The\r\nvast quantities of new and fertile land opened in the west of Georgia,\r\nin Alabama, and Mississippi, injured the value of the old and partly\r\nexhausted lands of the Atlantic States. Labor was drawn off to found\r\nplantations in the new States, and the injurious consequences were\r\nascribed to the tariff. Considerations of a political nature had\r\nentirely changed the tolerant feeling which, up to a certain period, had\r\nbeen shown by one class of Southern politicians toward the protective\r\npolicy. With the exception of Louisiana, and one or two votes in\r\nVirginia, the whole South was united against the tariff. South Carolina\r\nhad suffered most by the inability of her worn lands to sustain the\r\ncompetition with the lands of the Yazoo and the Red River, and to her\r\nthe most active opposition, under the lead of Mr. Calhoun, was confined.\r\nThe modern doctrine of nullification was broached by her accomplished\r\nstatesmen, and an unsuccessful attempt made to deduce it from the\r\nVirginia resolutions of 1798. Mr. Madison, in a letter addressed to the\r\nwriter of these pages,[18] in August, 1830, firmly resisted this\r\nattempt; and, as a theory, the whole doctrine of nullification was\r\noverthrown by Mr. Webster, in his speech of the 26th of January, 1830.\r\nBut public sentiment had gone too far in South Carolina to be checked;\r\nparty leaders were too deeply committed to retreat; and at the close of\r\n1832 the ordinance of nullification was adopted by a State convention.\r\n\r\nThis decisive act roused the hero of New Orleans from the vigilant\r\nrepose with which he had watched the coming storm. Confidential orders\r\nto hold themselves in readiness for active service were sent in every\r\ndirection to the officers of the army and the navy. Prudent and resolute\r\nmen were quietly stationed at the proper posts. Arms and munitions in\r\nabundance were held in readiness, and a chain of expresses in advance of\r\nthe mail was established from the Capitol to Charleston. These\r\npreparations made, the Presidential proclamation of the 11th of\r\nDecember, 1832, was issued. It was written by Mr. Edward Livingston,\r\nthen Secretary of State, from notes furnished by General Jackson\r\nhimself; but there is not an idea of importance in it which may not be\r\nfound in Mr. Webster's speech on Foot's resolution.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation of the President was met by the counter-proclamation of\r\nGovernor Hayne; and the State of South Carolina proceeded to pass laws\r\nfor carrying the ordinance of nullification into effect, and for putting\r\nthe State into a condition to carry on war with the general government.\r\nIn this posture of affairs the President of the United States laid the\r\nmatter before Congress, in his message of the 16th of January, 1833, and\r\nthe bill \"further to provide for the collection of duties on imports\"\r\nwas introduced into the Senate, in pursuance of his recommendations. Mr.\r\nCalhoun was at this time a member of that body, having been chosen to\r\nsucceed Governor Hayne, and having of course resigned the office of\r\nVice-President. Thus called, for the first time, to sustain in person\r\nbefore the Senate and the country the policy of nullification, which had\r\nbeen adopted by South Carolina mainly under his influence, and which was\r\nnow threatening the Union, it hardly need be said that he exerted all\r\nhis ability, and put forth all his resources, in defence of the doctrine\r\nwhich had brought his State to the verge of revolution. It is but\r\njustice to add, that he met the occasion with equal courage and vigor.\r\nThe bill \"to make further provision for the collection of the revenue,\"\r\nor \"Force Bill,\" as it was called, was reported by Mr. Wilkins from the\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary on the 21st of January, and on the following\r\nday Mr. Calhoun moved a series of resolutions, affirming the right of a\r\nState to annul, as far as her citizens are concerned, any act of\r\nCongress which she may deem oppressive and unconstitutional. On the 15th\r\nand 16th of February, he spoke at length in opposition to the bill, and\r\nin development and support of his resolutions. On this occasion the\r\ndoctrine of nullification was sustained by him with far greater ability\r\nthan it had been by General Hayne, and in a speech which we believe is\r\nregarded as Mr. Calhoun's most powerful effort. In closing his speech,\r\nMr. Calhoun challenged the opponents of his doctrines to disprove them,\r\nand warned them, in the concluding sentence, that the principles they\r\nmight advance would be subjected to the revision of posterity.[19]\r\n\r\nMr. Webster, before Mr. Calhoun had resumed his seat, or he had risen\r\nfrom his own, accepted the challenge, and commenced his reply. He began\r\nto speak as he was rising, and continued to address the Senate with\r\ngreat force and effect, for about two hours. The Senate then took a\r\nrecess, and after it came together Mr. Webster spoke again, from five\r\no'clock till eight in the evening. The speech was more purely a\r\nconstitutional argument than that of the 26th of January, 1830. It was\r\nmainly devoted to an examination of Mr. Calhoun's resolutions; to a\r\nreview of the adoption and ratification of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, by way of elucidating the question whether the system\r\nprovided by the Constitution is a government of the people or a compact\r\nbetween the States; and to a discussion of the constitutionality of the\r\ntariff. It was less various and discursive in its matter than the speech\r\non Foot's resolution, but more condensed and systematic. Inferior,\r\nperhaps, in interest for a mixed audience, from the absence of personal\r\nallusions, which at all times give the greatest piquancy to debate, a\r\nsevere judgment might pronounce it a finer piece of parliamentary logic.\r\nNor must it be inferred from this description that it was destitute of\r\npresent interest. The Senate-chamber was thronged to its utmost\r\ncapacity, both before and after the recess, although the streets of\r\nWashington, owing to the state of the weather at the time, were nearly\r\nimpassable.\r\n\r\nThe opinion entertained of this speech by the individual who, of all the\r\npeople of America, was the best qualified to estimate its value, may be\r\nseen from the following letter of Mr. Madison, which has never before\r\nbeen published.\r\n\r\n  \"_Montpellier, March 15th, 1833._\r\n\r\n  \"MY DEAR SIR:--I return my thanks for the copy of your late very\r\n  powerful speech in the Senate of the United States. It crushes\r\n  'nullification,' and must hasten an abandonment of 'secession.' But\r\n  this dodges the blow, by confounding the claim to secede at will\r\n  with the right of seceding from intolerable oppression. The former\r\n  answers itself, being a violation without cause of a faith solemnly\r\n  pledged. The latter is another name only for revolution, about which\r\n  there is no theoretic controversy. Its double aspect, nevertheless,\r\n  with the countenance received from certain quarters, is giving it a\r\n  popular currency here, which may influence the approaching elections\r\n  both for Congress and for the State legislature. It has gained some\r\n  advantage also by mixing itself with the question, whether the\r\n  Constitution of the United States was formed by the people or by the\r\n  States, now under a theoretic discussion by animated partisans.\r\n\r\n  \"It is fortunate when disputed theories can be decided by\r\n  undisputed facts, and here the undisputed fact is, that the\r\n  Constitution was made by the people, but as embodied into the\r\n  several States who were parties to it, and therefore made by the\r\n  States in their highest authoritative capacity. They might, by the\r\n  same authority and by the same process, have converted the\r\n  confederacy into a mere league or treaty, or continued it with\r\n  enlarged or abridged powers; or have embodied the people of their\r\n  respective States into one people, nation, or sovereignty; or, as\r\n  they did, by a mixed form, make them one people, nation, or\r\n  sovereignty for certain purposes, and not so for others.\r\n\r\n  \"The Constitution of the United States, being established by a\r\n  competent authority, by that of the sovereign people of the several\r\n  States who were parties to it, it remains only to inquire what the\r\n  Constitution is; and here it speaks for itself. It organizes a\r\n  government into the usual legislative, executive, and judiciary\r\n  departments; invests it with specified powers, leaving others to the\r\n  parties to the Constitution. It makes the government like other\r\n  governments to operate directly on the people; places at its command\r\n  the needful physical means of executing its powers; and finally\r\n  proclaims its supremacy, and that of the laws made in pursuance of\r\n  it, over the constitutions and laws of the States, the powers of the\r\n  government being exercised, as in other elective and responsible\r\n  governments, under the control of its constituents, the people and\r\n  the legislatures of the States, and subject to the revolutionary\r\n  rights of the people, in extreme cases.\r\n\r\n  \"Such is the Constitution of the United States _de jure_ and _de\r\n  facto_, and the name, whatever it be, that may be given to it can\r\n  make it nothing more or less than what it is.\r\n\r\n  \"Pardon this hasty effusion, which, whether precisely according or\r\n  not with your ideas, presents, I am aware, none that will be new to\r\n  you.\r\n\r\n  \"With great esteem and cordial salutations,\r\n\r\n  \"JAMES MADISON.\"\r\n\r\n  To \"MR. WEBSTER.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be observed, in reference to the closing remark in the above\r\nimportant letter, that the view which it presents of the nature of the\r\ngovernment established by the Constitution is precisely that taken by\r\nMr. Webster in the various speeches in which the subject is discussed by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States felt the importance of Mr. Webster's\r\naid in the great constitutional struggle of the session. There were\r\nmen of great ability enlisted in support of his administration,\r\nMessrs Forsyth, Grundy, Dallas, Rives, and others, but no one competent\r\nto assume the post of antagonist to the great Southern leader. The\r\ngeneral political position of Mr. Webster made it in no degree his duty\r\nto sustain the administration in any party measure, but the reverse.\r\nBut his whole course as a public man, and all his principles,\r\nforbade him to act from party motives in a great crisis of the\r\ncountry's fortunes. The administration was now engaged in a fearful\r\nstruggle for the preservation of the Union, and the integrity of the\r\nConstitution. The doctrines of the proclamation were the doctrines of\r\nhis speech on Foot's resolution almost to the words. He would have been\r\nunjust to his most cherished principles and his views of public duty\r\nhad he not come to the rescue, not of the administration, but of the\r\ncountry, in this hour of her peril. His aid was personally solicited\r\nin the great debate on the \"Force Bill\" by a member of the Cabinet, but\r\nit was not granted till the bill had undergone important amendments\r\nsuggested by him, when it was given cordially, without stint and\r\nwithout condition.[20]\r\n\r\nIn the recess of Congress in the year 1833, Mr. Webster made a short\r\njourney to the Middle States and the West. He was everywhere the object\r\nof the most distinguished and respectful attentions. Public receptions\r\ntook place at Buffalo and Pittsburg, where, under the auspices of\r\ncommittees of the highest respectability, he addressed immense\r\nassemblages convened without distinction of party. Invitations to\r\nsimilar meetings reached him from many quarters, which he was obliged by\r\nwant of leisure to decline.\r\n\r\nThe friendly relations into which Mr. Webster had been drawn with the\r\nPresident, and the enthusiastic welcome given to the President on his\r\ntour to the East, in the summer of 1833, awakened jealousy in certain\r\nquarters. It was believed at the time, by well-informed persons, that\r\namong the motives which actuated some persons in General Jackson's\r\nconfidence, in fanning his hostility to the Bank of the United States,\r\nwas that of bringing forward a question of great interest both to the\r\npublic and the President, on which he would be sure to encounter Mr.\r\nWebster's opposition.\r\n\r\nSuch a subject was the removal of the deposits of the public moneys from\r\nthe Bank of the United States, a measure productive of more immediate\r\ndistress to the community and a larger train of evil consequences than\r\nperhaps any similar measure in our political history. It was finally\r\ndetermined upon while the President was on his Northern tour, in the\r\nsummer of 1833, receiving in every part of New England those warm\r\ndemonstrations of respect which his patriotic course in the great\r\nnullification struggle had inspired. It is proper to state, that up to\r\nthis period, in the judgment of more than one committee of Congress\r\nappointed to investigate its affairs, in the opinion of both houses of\r\nCongress, who in 1832 had passed a bill to renew the charter, and of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, which had resolved that the deposits were safe\r\nin its custody, the affairs of the bank had been conducted with\r\nprudence, integrity, and remarkable skill. It was not the least evil\r\nconsequence of the warfare waged upon the bank, that it was finally\r\ndrawn into a position (though not till its Congressional charter\r\nexpired, and it accepted very unwisely a charter as a State institution)\r\nin which, in its desperate struggle to sustain itself, it finally\r\nforfeited the confidence of its friends and the public, and made a\r\ndeplorable and shameful shipwreck at once of its interests and honor,\r\ninvolving hundreds, at home and abroad, in its own deserved ruin.\r\n\r\nThe second administration of General Jackson, which commenced in March,\r\n1833, was principally employed in carrying on this war against the bank,\r\nand in the effort to build up the league of the associated banks into an\r\nefficient fiscal agent of the government. The dangerous crisis of\r\naffairs in South Carolina had, for the time, passed. The passage of the\r\n\"Force Bill\" had vindicated the authority of the Constitution as the\r\nsupreme law of the land, and had armed the President with the needed\r\npowers to maintain it. On the other hand, the Compromise Bill of Mr.\r\nClay, providing for the gradual reduction of all duties to one uniform\r\nrate of twenty per cent., was accepted by Mr. Calhoun and his friends as\r\na practical concession, and furnished them the opportunity of making\r\nwhat they deemed a not discreditable retreat from the attitude of\r\nmilitary resistance in which they had placed the State. Regarding this\r\nbill in the light of a concession to unconstitutional menace, as tending\r\nto the eventual prostration of all the interests which had grown up\r\nunder the system so long pursued by the government, Mr. Webster felt\r\nhimself compelled to withhold from it his support. He rejoiced, however,\r\nin the concurrence of events which had averted the dread appeal to arms\r\nthat seemed at one time unavoidable.\r\n\r\nIt would occupy an unreasonable space to dwell upon every public measure\r\nbefore Congress at this session; but there is one which cannot with\r\npropriety be passed over, as it drew forth from Mr. Webster an argument\r\nnot inferior to his speech on the \"Force Bill.\" A resolution, originally\r\nmoved by Mr. Clay, expressing disapprobation of the removal of the\r\ndeposits from the bank, was, after material amendments, adopted by the\r\nSenate. This resolution led to a formal protest from the President,\r\ncommunicated to the Senate on the 15th of April, 1834. Looking upon the\r\nresolution referred to as one of expediency, it is probable that Mr.\r\nWebster did not warmly favor, though, with Mr. Calhoun, he concurred in,\r\nits passage. The protest of the President, however, placed the subject\r\non new ground. Mr. Webster considered it as an encroachment on the\r\nconstitutional rights of the Senate, and as a denial to that body of the\r\nfreedom of action which the executive claimed so earnestly for itself.\r\nHe accordingly addressed the Senate on the 7th of May, in a speech of\r\nthe highest ability, in which the doctrines of the protest were\r\nsubjected to the severest scrutiny, and the constitutional rights and\r\nduties of the Senate asserted with a force and spirit worthy of the\r\nimportant position occupied by that body in the frame of the government.\r\nThis speech will be ever memorable for that sublime passage on the\r\nextent of the power of England, which will be quoted with admiration\r\nwherever our language is spoken and while England retains her place in\r\nthe family of nations.\r\n\r\nThis speech was received throughout the country with the highest favor;\r\nby the most distinguished jurists and statesmen as well as by the mass\r\nof the people. Chancellor Kent's language of praise passes the limits of\r\nmoderation. \"You never,\" said he, \"equalled this effort. It surpasses\r\nevery thing in logic, in simplicity and beauty and energy of diction, in\r\nclearness, in rebuke, in sarcasm, in patriotic and glowing feeling, in\r\njust and profound constitutional views, in critical severity, and\r\nmatchless strength. It is worth millions to our liberties.\" Not less\r\ndecided was the approbation of a gentleman of great sagacity and\r\nexperience as a statesman, Governor Tazewell of Virginia. In writing to\r\nMr. Tyler he uses this language: \"Tell Webster from me that I have read\r\nhis speech in the National Intelligencer with more pleasure than any I\r\nhave lately seen. If the approbation of one who has not been used to\r\ncoincide with him in opinion can be grateful to him, he has mine _in\r\nextenso_. I agree with him perfectly, and thank him cordially for his\r\nmany excellent illustrations of what I always thought. If it is\r\npublished in a pamphlet form, beg him to send me one. I will have it\r\nbound in good Russia leather, and leave it as a special legacy to my\r\nchildren.\"[21]\r\n\r\nAt the same session of Congress, Mr. Webster spoke frequently on the\r\npresentation of memorials, which were poured in upon him from every part\r\nof the country, in reference to the existing distress. These speeches\r\nwere of necessity made, in almost every case, with little or no\r\npreparation, but many of them contain expositions of the operation of\r\nthe financial experiment instituted by General Jackson, which will\r\nretain a permanent value in our political history. Some of them are\r\nmarked by bursts of the highest eloquence. The entire subject of the\r\ncurrency was also treated with great ability by Mr. Webster, in a report\r\nmade at this session of Congress from the committee of the Senate on\r\nfinance, of which he was chairman. Few documents more skilfully digested\r\nor powerfully reasoned have proceeded from his pen.\r\n\r\nThe same topics substantially occupied the attention of the Senate at\r\nthe Twenty-fourth as at the Twenty-third Congress. The principal\r\nsubjects discussed pertained to the currency. The specie circular and\r\nthe distribution of the surplus revenue were among the prominent\r\nmeasures. A motion made in the Senate to expunge from its records\r\nthe resolution of March, 1834, by which the Senate expressed its\r\ndisapprobation of the removal of the deposits, drew forth from Mr.\r\nWebster, on behalf of himself and his colleague, a protest against\r\nthat measure, of singular earnestness and power. Committed to writing,\r\nand read with unusual solemnity, it produced upon the Senate an effect\r\nwhich is still remembered and spoken of. Every word in it is weighed\r\nas in a balance.\r\n\r\nThe administration of General Jackson was drawing to a close; Mr. Van\r\nBuren had been chosen to succeed him in November, 1836. In the month of\r\nFebruary following, upon an invitation from a large committee of\r\nmerchants, professional men, and citizens generally of New York, given\r\nsome months previous, Mr. Webster attended one of those great public\r\nmeetings which he has been so often called to address. His speech on\r\nthis occasion, delivered in Niblo's Saloon on the 15th of March, 1837,\r\nis one of the most important in this collection. It embraced a\r\ncomprehensive review of the entire course of General Jackson's policy,\r\nand closed with a prediction of the impending catastrophe. After the\r\nadjournment of Congress, Mr. Webster made a hasty tour to the West, in\r\nthe course of which he addressed large public meetings at Wheeling in\r\nVirginia, at Madison in Indiana, and at other places. The coincidence of\r\npassing events with all his anticipations of the certain effects of the\r\nadministration policy gave peculiar force to these addresses. It is to\r\nbe regretted that these speeches appear from inadequate reports; of some\r\nof the speeches made by him on this tour, no notes were taken.\r\n\r\nSuch was the financial embarrassment induced by the explosion of the\r\nsystem of the late administration, that President Van Buren's first\r\nofficial act was a proclamation for an extra session of Congress, to be\r\nheld in September, 1837. At this session the new government plan of\r\nfinance, usually called \"the Sub-treasury system,\" was brought forward.\r\nIt was the opinion of Mr. Webster, that the rigid enforcement by the\r\ngovernment of a system of specie payments in all its public receipts and\r\nexpenditures was an actual impossibility, in the present state of things\r\nin this country and the other commercial countries of the civilized\r\nworld. The attempt to reject altogether the aid of convertible paper, of\r\nbills of exchange, of drafts, and other substitutes for the use and\r\ntransportation of the precious metals, must fail in practice in a\r\ncommercial country, where the great mass of the business affairs of the\r\ncommunity are transacted with their aid. If the attempt could be forced\r\nthrough, it would be like an attempt on the part of the government to\r\nmake use of the ancient modes of travel and conveyance, while every\r\ncitizen in his private affairs enjoyed the benefit of steam navigation\r\nand railways. Mr. Webster accordingly opposed the sub-treasury project\r\nfrom its inception; and it failed to become a law at the extra session\r\nof Congress in 1837.\r\n\r\nSomewhat to the surprise of the country generally, it received the\r\nsupport of Mr. Calhoun. In common with most of his friends, he had\r\nsustained the Bank of the United States, and denounced the financial\r\npolicy of General Jackson at every stage. But at the extra session of\r\nCongress he expressed opinions favorable to the sub-treasury, and\r\nfollowed them up in a remarkable letter to his constituents, published\r\nafter the adjournment. At the winter session of 1837-38 he defended the\r\ngovernment plan in an elaborate speech. This speech drew from Mr.\r\nWebster a very able reply. He had, earlier in the session, delivered his\r\nsentiments in opposition to the government measure, and Mr. Calhoun, in\r\nhis speech of the 15th of February, 1838, had animadverted upon them,\r\nand represented the sub-treasury system as little more than an attempt\r\nto carry out the joint resolution of the 30th of April, 1816, which, as\r\nwe have seen above, was introduced by Mr. Webster, and was the immediate\r\nmeans of restoring specie payments after the war.\r\n\r\nThis reference, as well as the whole tenor of Mr. Calhoun's remarks,\r\ncalled upon Mr. Webster for a rejoinder, which was made by him on the\r\n12th of March. It is the most elaborate and effective of Mr. Webster's\r\nspeeches on the subject of the currency.[22] The constitutional right of\r\nthe general government to employ a convertible paper in its fiscal\r\ntransactions, and to make use of banks in the custody and transmission\r\nof its funds, is argued in this speech with much ability, from the\r\nnecessity of the case, from the contemporaneous expositions of the\r\nConstitution, from the practice of the government under every\r\nadministration, from the expressed views and opinions of every President\r\nof the United States, including General Jackson, and from the\r\noften-declared opinions of all the leading statesmen of the country, not\r\nexcepting Mr. Calhoun himself, whose course in this respect was reviewed\r\nby Mr. Webster somewhat at length, and in such a way as unavoidably to\r\nsuggest the idea of inconsistency, although no such charge was made.\r\n\r\nTo some portions of this speech Mr. Calhoun replied a few weeks\r\nafterwards, and sought to ward off the comments upon his own course in\r\nreference to this class of questions, by some severe strictures on that\r\nof Mr. Webster. This drew from him a prompt and spirited rejoinder. The\r\nfollowing passage may be extracted as a specimen:--\r\n\r\n  \"But, Sir, before attempting that, he [Mr. Calhoun] has something\r\n  else to say. He had prepared, it seems, to draw comparisons himself.\r\n  He had intended to say something, if time had allowed, upon our\r\n  respective opinions and conduct in regard to the war. If time had\r\n  allowed! Sir, time does allow, time must allow. A general remark of\r\n  that kind ought not to be, cannot be, left to produce its effect,\r\n  when that effect is obviously intended to be unfavorable. Why did\r\n  the gentleman allude to my votes or my opinions respecting the war\r\n  at all, unless he had something to say? Does he wish to leave an\r\n  undefined impression that something was done, or something said, by\r\n  me, not now capable of defence or justification? something not\r\n  reconcilable with true patriotism? He means that, or nothing. And\r\n  now, Sir, let him bring the matter forth; let him take the\r\n  responsibility of the accusation; let him state his facts. I am here\r\n  to answer; I am here, this day, to answer. Now is the time, and now\r\n  the hour. I think we read, Sir, that one of the good spirits would\r\n  not bring against the Arch-enemy of mankind a railing accusation;\r\n  and what is railing but general reproach, an imputation without\r\n  fact, time, or circumstance? Sir, I call for particulars. The\r\n  gentleman knows my whole conduct well; indeed, the journals show it\r\n  all, from the moment I came into Congress till the peace. If I have\r\n  done, then, Sir, any thing unpatriotic, any thing which, as far as\r\n  love to country goes, will not bear comparison with his or any man's\r\n  conduct, let it now be stated. Give me the fact, the time, the\r\n  manner. He speaks of the war; that which we call the late war,\r\n  though it is now twenty-five years since it terminated. He would\r\n  leave an impression that I opposed it. How? I was not in Congress\r\n  when war was declared, nor in public life anywhere. I was pursuing\r\n  my profession, keeping company with judges and jurors, and\r\n  plaintiffs and defendants. If I had been in Congress, and had\r\n  enjoyed the benefit of hearing the honorable gentleman's speeches,\r\n  for aught I can say, I might have concurred with him. But I was not\r\n  in public life. I never had been for a single hour; and was in no\r\n  situation, therefore, to oppose or to support the declaration of\r\n  war. I am speaking to the fact, Sir; and if the gentleman has any\r\n  fact, let us know it.\r\n\r\n  \"Well, Sir, I came into Congress during the war. I found it waged,\r\n  and raging. And what did I do here to oppose it? Look to the\r\n  journals. Let the honorable gentleman tax his memory. Bring up any\r\n  thing, if there be any thing to bring up, not showing error of\r\n  opinion, but showing want of loyalty or fidelity to the country. I\r\n  did not agree to all that was proposed, nor did the honorable\r\n  member. I did not approve of every measure, nor did he. The war had\r\n  been preceded by the restrictive system and the embargo. As a\r\n  private individual, I certainly did not think well of these\r\n  measures. It appeared to me that the embargo annoyed ourselves as\r\n  much as our enemies, while it destroyed the business and cramped the\r\n  spirits of the people. In this opinion I may have been right or\r\n  wrong, but the gentleman was himself of the same opinion. He told us\r\n  the other day, as a proof of his independence of party on great\r\n  questions, that he differed with his friends on the subject of the\r\n  embargo. He was decidedly and unalterably opposed to it. It\r\n  furnishes in his judgment, therefore, no imputation either on my\r\n  patriotism, or on the soundness of my political opinions, that I was\r\n  opposed to it also. I mean opposed in opinion; for I was not in\r\n  Congress, and had nothing to do with the act creating the embargo.\r\n  And as to opposition to measures for carrying on the war, after I\r\n  came into Congress, I again say, let the gentleman specify; let him\r\n  lay his finger on any thing calling for an answer, and he shall have\r\n  an answer.\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. President, you were yourself in the House during a considerable\r\n  part of this time. The honorable gentleman may make a witness of\r\n  you. He may make a witness of any body else. He may be his own\r\n  witness. Give us but some fact, some charge, something capable in\r\n  itself either of being proved or disproved. Prove any thing, state\r\n  any thing, not consistent with honorable and patriotic conduct, and\r\n  I am ready to answer it. Sir, I am glad this subject has been\r\n  alluded to in a manner which justifies me in taking public notice of\r\n  it; because I am well aware that, for ten years past, infinite pains\r\n  has been taken to find something, in the range of these topics,\r\n  which might create prejudice against me in the country. The journals\r\n  have all been pored over, and the reports ransacked, and scraps of\r\n  paragraphs and half-sentences have been collected, fraudulently put\r\n  together, and then made to flare out as if there had been some\r\n  discovery. But all this failed. The next resort was to supposed\r\n  correspondence. My letters were sought for, to learn if, in the\r\n  confidence of private friendship, I had ever said any thing which an\r\n  enemy could make use of. With this view, the vicinity of my former\r\n  residence has been searched, as with a lighted candle. New Hampshire\r\n  has been explored from the mouth of the Merrimack to the White\r\n  Hills. In one instance, a gentleman had left the State, gone five\r\n  hundred miles off, and died. His papers were examined; a letter was\r\n  found, and, I have understood, it was brought to Washington; a\r\n  conclave was held to consider it, and the result was, that, if there\r\n  was nothing else against Mr. Webster, the matter had better be let\r\n  alone. Sir, I hope to make every body of that opinion who brings\r\n  against me a charge of want of patriotism. Errors of opinion can be\r\n  found, doubtless, on many subjects; but as conduct flows from the\r\n  feelings which animate the heart, I know that no act of my life has\r\n  had its origin in the want of ardent love of country.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the only occasion during the long political lives of these\r\ndistinguished statesmen, begun nearly at the same time, and continued\r\nthrough a Congressional career which brought them of necessity much in\r\ncontact with each other, in which there was any approach to personality\r\nin their keen encounters. In fact, of all the highly eminent public men\r\nof the day, they are the individuals who have made the least use of the\r\nfavorite weapon of ordinary politicians, personality toward opponents.\r\nOn the decease of Mr. Calhoun at Washington, in the spring of 1850,\r\ntheir uninterrupted friendly relations were alluded to by Mr. Webster in\r\ncordial and affecting terms. He regarded Mr. Calhoun as decidedly the\r\nablest of the public men to whom he had been opposed in the course of\r\nhis political life.\r\n\r\nThese kindly feelings on Mr. Webster's part were fully reciprocated by\r\nMr. Calhoun. He is known to have declared on his death-bed, that, of all\r\nthe public men of the day, there was no one whose political course had\r\nbeen more strongly marked by a strict regard to truth and honor than Mr.\r\nWebster's.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1839, Mr. Webster crossed the Atlantic for the first\r\ntime in his life, making a hasty tour through England, Scotland, and\r\nFrance. His attention was particularly drawn to the agriculture of\r\nEngland and Scotland; to the great subjects of currency and exchange; to\r\nthe condition of the laboring classes; and to the practical effect on\r\nthe politics of Europe of the system of the Continental alliance. No\r\ntraveller from this country has probably ever been received with equal\r\nattention in the highest quarters in England. Courtesies usually paid\r\nonly to ambassadors and foreign ministers were extended to him. His\r\ntable was covered with invitations to the seats of the nobility and\r\ngentry; and his company was eagerly sought at the public entertainments\r\nwhich took place while he was in the country. Among the distinguished\r\nindividuals with whom he contracted intimate relations of friendship,\r\nthe late Lord Ashburton may be particularly mentioned. A mutual regard\r\nof more than usual warmth arose between them. This circumstance was well\r\nunderstood in the higher circles of English society, and when, two years\r\nlater, a change of administration in both countries brought the parties\r\nto which they were respectively attached into power, the friendly\r\nrelations well known to exist between them were no doubt among the\r\nmotives which led to the appointment of Lord Ashburton as special\r\nminister to the United States.\r\n\r\nToward that great political change which was consummated in 1840, by\r\nwhich General Harrison was raised to the Presidency, no individual\r\nprobably in the country had contributed more largely than Mr. Webster;\r\nand this by powerful appeals to the reason of the people. His speeches\r\nhad been for years a public armory, from which weapons both of attack\r\nand defence were furnished to his political friends throughout the\r\nUnion. The financial policy of the two preceding administrations was the\r\nchief cause of the general discontent which prevailed; and it is doing\r\nno injustice to the other eminent leaders of opposition in the several\r\nStates to say, that by none of them had the vices of this system from\r\nthe first been so laboriously and effectively exposed as by Mr. Webster.\r\nDuring the canvass of 1840, the most strenuous ever witnessed in the\r\nUnited States, he gave himself up for months to what may literally be\r\ncalled the arduous labor of the field. These volumes exhibit the proof,\r\nthat not only in Massachusetts, but in distant places, from Albany to\r\nRichmond, his voice of encouragement and exhortation was heard.\r\n\r\nThe event corresponded to the effort, and General Harrison was\r\ntriumphantly elected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [18] North American Review, Vol. XXXI. p. 537.\r\n\r\n   [19] This passage does not appear in the report preserved in the volume\r\n        containing his Select Speeches.\r\n\r\n   [20] It is not wholly unworthy of remark in this place, as illustrating\r\n        the dependence on Mr. Webster's aid which was felt at the White\r\n        House, that, on the day of his reply to Mr. Calhoun, the\r\n        President's carriage was sent to Mr. Webster's lodgings, as was\r\n        supposed with a message borne by the President's private\r\n        secretary.

He produced a copy of the speech of Mr.\r\n        Webster before the committee, and pronounced it one of the\r\n        ablest and most satisfactory discussions of these subjects which\r\n        he had seen. In writing afterwards to Mr. Webster, he spoke of\r\n        him as a master who had instructed him on these subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.[23]\r\n\r\n  Critical State of Foreign Affairs on the Accession of General\r\n  Harrison.--Mr. Webster appointed to the State Department.--Death\r\n  of General Harrison.--Embarrassed Relations with England.--Formation\r\n  of Sir Robert Peel's Ministry, and Appointment of Lord Ashburton\r\n  as Special Minister to the United States.--Course pursued by Mr.\r\n  Webster in the Negotiations.--The Northeastern Boundary.--Peculiar\r\n  Difficulties in its Settlement happily overcome.--Other Subjects\r\n  of Negotiation.--Extradition of Fugitives from Justice.--Suppression\r\n  of the Slave-Trade on the Coast of Africa.--History of that\r\n  Question.--Affair of the Caroline.--Impressment.--Other Subjects\r\n  connected with the Foreign Relations of the Government.--Intercourse\r\n  with China.--Independence of the Sandwich Islands.--Correspondence\r\n  with Mexico.--Sound Duties and the Zoll-Verein.--Importance of\r\n  Mr. Webster's Services as Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe condition of affairs in the United States, on the accession of\r\nPresident Harrison to office, in the spring of 1841, was difficult and\r\ncritical, especially as far as the foreign relations of the country were\r\nconcerned. Ancient and modern controversies existed with England, which\r\nseemed to defy adjustment. The great question of the northeastern\r\nboundary had been the subject of negotiation almost ever since the peace\r\nof 1783. Every effort to settle it had but increased the difficulties\r\nwith which it was beset, by exhausting the expedients of diplomacy. The\r\nOregon question was rapidly assuming a formidable aspect, as emigrants\r\nbegan to move into the country in dispute. Not less serious was the\r\nstate of affairs on the southwestern frontier, where, although a\r\ncollision with Mexico might not in itself be an event to be viewed with\r\ngreat anxiety, it was probable, as things then stood, that it would have\r\nbrought a war with Great Britain in its train.\r\n\r\nTo the uneasiness necessarily growing out of these boundary questions,\r\nno little bitterness was added by more recent occurrences. The\r\ninterruption of our vessels on the coast of Africa was a frequently\r\nrecurring source of irritation. Great cause of complaint was sometimes\r\ngiven by boarding officers, acting on frivolous pretences or in a\r\nvexatious manner. At other times the public feeling in the United\r\nStates was excited by the exaggerations and misstatements of unworthy\r\nAmerican citizens, who abused the flag of the country to cover a\r\ndetestable traffic, which is made a capital felony by its laws. The\r\naffair of the \"Caroline,\" followed by the arrest of McLeod, created a\r\ndegree of discontent on both sides, which discussion had done nothing to\r\nremove, but much to exasperate. A crisis had arisen, which the Minister\r\nof the United States in London[24] deemed so serious, as to make it his\r\nduty to communicate with the commander of the American squadron in the\r\nMediterranean.[25]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things when General Harrison acceded to the\r\nPresidency, after perhaps the most strenuously contested election ever\r\nknown, and by a larger popular vote than had ever before been given in\r\nthe United States. As soon as the result was known, the President elect\r\naddressed a letter to Mr. Webster, offering him any place he might\r\nchoose in his Cabinet, and asking his advice as to the other members of\r\nwhich it should be composed. The wants and wishes of the country in\r\nreference to currency and finance having brought about the political\r\nrevolution which placed General Harrison in the chair, he was rather\r\ndesirous that the Department of the Treasury should be assumed by Mr.\r\nWebster, who had studied those subjects profoundly, and whose opinions\r\nwere in full concurrence with his own. Averse to the daily drudgery of\r\nthe Treasury, Mr. Webster gave his preference to the Department of\r\nState, without concealing from himself that it might be the post of\r\ngreater care and responsibility. In this anticipation he was not\r\ndisappointed. Although the whole of the danger did not at once appear,\r\nit was evident from the outset that the moment was extremely critical.\r\nStill, however, the circumstances under which General Harrison was\r\nelected were such as to give to his administration a moral power and a\r\nfreedom of action, as to pre-existing controversies, favorable to their\r\nsettlement on honorable terms.\r\n\r\nBut the death of the new President, when just entering upon the\r\ndischarge of his duties, changed the state of affairs in this\r\nrespect. The great national party which had called him to the helm\r\nwas struck with astonishment. No rallying-point presented itself. A\r\nposition of things existed, not overlooked, indeed, by the sagacious men\r\nwho framed the Constitution, but which, from its very nature, can\r\nnever enter practically into the calculations of the enthusiastic\r\nmultitudes by which, in times of difficulty and excitement, a favorite\r\ncandidate is borne to the chair. How much of the control which it\r\nwould otherwise have possessed over public opinion could be retained\r\nby an administration thus unexpectedly deprived of its head, was a\r\nquestion which time alone could settle. Happily, as far as our\r\nforeign relations were concerned, a character had been assumed by the\r\nadministration, from the very formation of General Harrison's\r\nCabinet, which was steadily maintained, till the adjustment of the\r\nmost difficult points in controversy was effected by the treaty of\r\nWashington. President Harrison, as is well known, lived but one\r\nmonth after his inauguration, but all the members of his Cabinet\r\nremained in office under Mr. Tyler, who succeeded to the Presidency.\r\nWith him, of course, rested the general authority of regulating and\r\ndirecting the negotiations with foreign powers, in which the\r\ngovernment might be engaged. But the active management of these\r\nnegotiations was in the hands of the Secretary of State, and it is\r\nbelieved that no difference of views in regard to important matters\r\narose between him and Mr. Tyler. For the result of the principal\r\nnegotiation, Mr. Tyler manifested great anxiety; and Mr. Webster has\r\nnot failed, in public or private, to bear witness to the intelligent and\r\nearnest attention which was bestowed by him on the proceedings,\r\nthrough all their stages, and to express his sense of the confidence\r\nreposed in himself by the head of the administration, from the\r\nbeginning to the end of the transactions.\r\n\r\nIf the position of things was difficult here, it was not less so on the\r\nother side of the Atlantic; indeed, many of the causes of embarrassment\r\nwere common to the two countries. There, as here, the correspondence,\r\nwhether conducted at Washington or London, had of late years done\r\nnothing toward an amicable settlement of the great questions at issue.\r\nIt had degenerated into an exercise of diplomatic logic, with the\r\neffect, in England as well as in America, of strengthening each party in\r\nthe belief of its own rights, and of working up the public mind to a\r\nreluctant feeling that the time was at hand when those rights must be\r\nmaintained by force. That the British and American governments, during a\r\nconsiderable part of the administrations of General Jackson and Mr. Van\r\nBuren, should, with the fate of the reference to the King of the\r\nNetherlands before their eyes, have exerted themselves with melancholy\r\ningenuity in arranging the impossible details of another convention of\r\nexploration and arbitration, shows of itself that neither party had any\r\nreal hope of actually settling the controversy, but that both were\r\nwilling to unite in a decent pretext for procrastination.\r\n\r\nThe report of Mr. Featherstonhaugh, erroneously believed, in England, to\r\nrest upon the results of actual exploration, had been sanctioned by the\r\nministry, and seemed to extinguish the last hope that England would\r\nagree to any terms of settlement which the United States would deem\r\nreasonable. The danger of collision on the frontier became daily more\r\nimminent, and troops to the amount of seventeen regiments had been\r\npoured into the British Provinces. The arrest of McLeod, as we have\r\nalready observed, had brought matters to a point at which the public\r\nsensibility of England would not have allowed a minister to blink the\r\nquestion. Lord Palmerston is known to have written to Mr. Fox, that the\r\narrest of McLeod, under the authority of the State of New York, was\r\nuniversally regarded in England as a direct affront to the British\r\ngovernment, and that such was the excitement caused by it, that, if\r\nMcLeod should be condemned and executed, it would not be in the power\r\neither of ministers or opposition, or of the leading men of both\r\nparties, to prevent immediate war.\r\n\r\nWhile this was the state of affairs with reference to the immediate\r\nrelations of the two countries, Lord Palmerston was urging France into a\r\ncooeperation with the four other leading powers of Europe in the adoption\r\nof a policy, by the negotiation of the quintuple treaty, which would\r\nhave left the United States in a position of dangerous insulation on the\r\nsubject of the great maritime question of the day.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, a change of administration occurred in England,\r\nsubsequent but by a few months to that which had taken place in the\r\ngovernment of the United States. Lord Melbourne's government gave way to\r\nthat of Sir Robert Peel in the summer of 1841; it remained to be seen\r\nwith what influence on the relations of the two countries. Some\r\ncircumstances occurred to put at risk the tendency toward an\r\naccommodation, which might naturally be hoped for from a change of\r\nadministration nearly simultaneous on both sides of the water. A note of\r\na very uncompromising character, on the subject of the search of\r\nAmerican vessels on the coast of Africa, had been addressed to Mr.\r\nStevenson by Lord Palmerston on the 27th of August, 1841, a day only\r\nbefore the expiration of Lord Melbourne's ministry. To this note Mr.\r\nStevenson replied in the same strain. The answer of Lord Aberdeen, who\r\nhad succeeded Lord Palmerston as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,\r\nbears date the 10th of October, 1841, and an elaborate rejoinder was\r\nreturned by Mr. Stevenson on the very day of his departure from London.\r\nLord Aberdeen's reply to this note was of necessity addressed to Mr.\r\nEverett, who had succeeded Mr. Stevenson. It was dated on the 20th of\r\nDecember, the day on which the quintuple treaty was signed at London by\r\nthe representatives of the five powers, and it contained an announcement\r\nof that fact.\r\n\r\nHappily, however, affairs were already taking a turn auspicious of\r\nbetter results. From his first entrance on office as Secretary of State,\r\nMr. Webster, long familiar with the perplexed history of the negotiation\r\nrelative to the boundary, had perceived the necessity of taking a \"new\r\ndeparture.\" The negotiation had broken down under its own weight. It was\r\nlike one of those lawsuits which, to the opprobrium of tribunals,\r\ndescend from age to age; a disease of the body politic not merely\r\nchronic, but hereditary. Early in the summer of 1841, Mr. Webster had\r\nintimated to Mr. Fox, the British Minister at Washington, that the\r\nAmerican government was prepared to consider, and, if practicable,\r\nadopt, a conventional line, as the only mode of cutting the Gordian knot\r\nof the controversy. This overture was, of course, conveyed to London.\r\nThough not leading to any result on the part of the ministry just going\r\nout of office, it was embraced by their successors in the same wise and\r\nconciliatory spirit in which it had been made. On the 26th of December,\r\n1841, a note was addressed by Lord Aberdeen to Mr. Everett, inviting him\r\nto an interview on the following day, when he communicated the purpose\r\nof the British government to send a special mission to the United\r\nStates, Lord Ashburton being the person selected as minister, and\r\nfurnished with full powers to settle every question in controversy.\r\n\r\nThis step on the part of the British government was as bold as it was\r\nwise. It met the difficulty in the face. It justly assumed the existence\r\nof a corresponding spirit of conciliation on the part of the United\r\nStates, and of a desire to bring matters to a practical result. It was\r\nbold, because it was the last expedient for an amicable adjustment, and\r\nbecause its failure must necessarily lead to very serious and immediate\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nIn his choice of a minister, Lord Aberdeen was not less fortunate than\r\nhe had been wise in proposing the measure. Lord Ashburton was above the\r\nreach of the motives which influence politicians of an ordinary stamp,\r\nand unencumbered by the habits of routine which belong to men regularly\r\ntrained in a career. He possessed a weight of character at home which\r\nmade him independent of the vulgar resorts of popularity. He was\r\nanimated by a kindly feeling, and bound by kindly associations to this\r\ncountry. There was certainly no public man in England who united in an\r\nequal degree the confidence of his own government and country with those\r\nclaims to the good-will of the opposite party, which were scarcely less\r\nessential to success. The relations of personal friendship contracted by\r\nMr. Webster with Lord Ashburton in 1839 have already been alluded to, as\r\ninfluencing the selection. They decided Lord Ashburton in accepting the\r\nappointment. The writer was informed by Lord Ashburton himself, that he\r\nshould have despaired of bringing matters to a settlement advantageous\r\nto both countries, but for his reliance on the upright and honorable\r\ncharacter of the American Secretary.\r\n\r\nWith the appointment of Lord Ashburton, the discussion of the main\r\nquestions in controversy between the two countries, as far as it had\r\nbeen carried on in London, was transferred to Washington. But as an\r\nearnest of the conciliatory spirit which bore sway in the British\r\ncounsels, Lord Aberdeen had announced to Mr. Everett, in the interval\r\nwhich elapsed between Lord Ashburton's appointment and his arrival at\r\nhis place of destination, that the Queen's government admitted the wrong\r\ndone by the detention of the \"Tigris\" and \"Seamew\" in the African\r\nwaters, and was prepared to indemnify their owners for the losses\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the favorable circumstances under which the mission of\r\nLord Ashburton was instituted, the great difficulties to be overcome\r\nsoon disclosed themselves. The points in dispute in reference to the\r\nboundary had for years been the subject of discussion, more or less,\r\nthroughout the country, but especially in Massachusetts and Maine (the\r\nStates having an immediate territorial interest in its decision), and,\r\nabove all, in the last-named State. Parties differing on all other great\r\nquestions emulated each other in the zeal with which they asserted the\r\nAmerican side of this dispute. So strong and unanimous was the feeling,\r\nthat, when the award of the King of the Netherlands arrived, the firm\r\npurpose of General Jackson to accept it was subdued. The writer of these\r\npages was informed by the late Mr. Forsyth, while Secretary of State,\r\nthat, when the award reached this country, General Jackson regarded it\r\nas definitive, and was disposed, without consulting the Senate, to issue\r\nhis proclamation announcing it as such; and that he was driven from this\r\ncourse by the representations of his friends in Maine, that it would\r\nchange the politics of the State. He was accustomed to add, in reference\r\nto the inconveniences caused by the rejection of the award, and the\r\nstill more serious evils to be anticipated, that \"it was somewhat\r\nsingular that the only occasion of importance in his life in which he\r\nhad allowed himself to be overruled by his friends, was one of all\r\nothers in which he ought to have adhered to his own opinions.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the diplomatic papers contained in the sixth volume of the present\r\nedition of Mr. Webster's works it appears that the first step taken by\r\nMr. Webster, after receiving the directions of the President in\r\nreference to the negotiation, was to invite the cooeperation of\r\nMassachusetts and Maine, the territory in dispute being the property\r\nof the two States, and under the jurisdiction of the latter. The extent\r\nof the treaty-making power of the United States, in a matter of such\r\ndelicacy as the cession of territory claimed by a State to be within\r\nits limits, belongs to the more difficult class of constitutional\r\ndoctrines. We have just seen both the theory and practice of General\r\nJackson on this point. The administration of Mr. Tyler took for\r\ngranted that the full consent of Massachusetts and Maine was necessary\r\nto any adjustment of this great dispute on the principle of mutual\r\ncession and equivalents, or any other principle than that of the\r\nascertainment of the true, original line of boundary by agreement,\r\nmutual commission, or arbitration. Communications were accordingly\r\naddressed to the governors of the two States. Massachusetts had\r\nanticipated the necessity of the measure, and made provision for the\r\nappointment of commissioners. The legislature of Maine was promptly\r\nconvened for the same purpose by the late Governor Fairfield. Four\r\nparties were thus in presence at Washington for the management of the\r\nnegotiation: the United States and Great Britain, Massachusetts and\r\nMaine. Recollecting that the question to be settled was one which\r\nhad defied all the arts of diplomacy for half a century, it seemed to\r\na distant, and especially a European observer, as if the last\r\nexperiment, exceeding every former step in its necessary complication,\r\nwas destined to a failure proportionably signal and ignominious. The\r\ncourse pursued by the American Secretary, in making the result of\r\nthe negotiation relative to the boundary contingent upon the approval\r\nof the State commissioners, was regarded in Europe as decidedly\r\nominous of its failure.\r\n\r\nIt undoubtedly required a high degree of political courage thus to put\r\nthe absolute control of the subject, to a certain extent, out of the\r\nhands of the national government; but it was a courage fully warranted\r\nby the event. It is now evident that this mode of procedure was the only\r\none which could have been adopted with any hope of success. Though\r\ncomplicated in appearance, it was in reality the simplest mode in which\r\nthe cooeperation of the States could have been secured. The commissions\r\nwere, upon the whole, happily constituted; they were framed in each\r\nState without reference to party views. By their presence in Washington,\r\nit was in the power of the Secretary of State to avail himself, at every\r\ndifficult conjuncture, of their counsel. Limited in number, they yet\r\nrepresented the public opinion of the two States, as fully as it could\r\nhave been done by the entire body of their legislatures; while it is\r\nquite evident that any attempt to refer to large deliberative bodies at\r\nhome the discussion of the separate points which arose in the\r\nnegotiation, would have been physically impossible and politically\r\nabsurd. The commissioners were, on the part of Maine, Messrs. Edward\r\nKavanagh, Edward Kent, William P. Preble, and John Otis; and on the part\r\nof Massachusetts, Messrs. Abbott Lawrence, John Mills, and Charles\r\nAllen.\r\n\r\nWhile we name with honor the gentlemen forming the commissions, a\r\ntribute of respect is also due to the patriotism of the States\r\nimmediately concerned, and especially of Maine. To devolve on any\r\nindividuals, however high in the public regard, a power of transferring,\r\nwithout ratification or appeal, a portion of the territory of the State,\r\nfor such consideration as those individuals might judge to be adequate,\r\nwas a measure to be expected only in a case of clear necessity and high\r\nconfidence. Mr. Webster is known to have regarded this with the utmost\r\nconcern and anxiety, as the turning-point of the whole attempt. His\r\nletter to Governor Fairfield states the case with equal strength and\r\nfairness, and puts the course there recommended in striking contrast\r\nwith that of proceeding to agree to another arbitration, as had been\r\noffered by the preceding administration, and assented to by England. The\r\nfate of the negotiation might be considered as involved in the success\r\nof this appeal to the chief magistrate of Maine, and through him to his\r\nconstituents. It is said that, when Mr. Webster heard that the\r\nlegislature of Maine had adopted the resolutions for the commission, he\r\nwent to President Tyler and said, with evident satisfaction and some\r\nanimation, \"_The crisis is past!_\"\r\n\r\nA considerable portion, though not the whole, of the official\r\ncorrespondence between the Secretary of State and the other parties to\r\nthe negotiation is contained in the sixth volume of this collection. The\r\ndocuments published exhibit full proof of the ability with which the\r\nargument was conducted. They probably furnish but an inadequate specimen\r\nof the judgment, tact, and moral power required to conduct such a\r\nnegotiation to a successful result. National, State, and individual\r\nsusceptibilities were to be respected and soothed; adverse interests,\r\nreal or imaginary, to be consulted; the ordeal of the Senate to be\r\npassed through, after every other difficulty had been overcome; and all\r\nthis in an atmosphere as little favorable to such an operation as can\r\nwell be imagined. What neither Mr. Monroe in the \"era of good feelings,\"\r\nnor the ability and experience of Messrs. Adams, Clay, and Gallatin, nor\r\nGeneral Jackson's overwhelming popularity, had been able to bring about,\r\nwas effected under the administration of Mr. Tyler, though that\r\nadministration seemed already crumbling for want of harmony between some\r\nof the members and the head, and between that head and the party which\r\nhad brought him into power. No higher tribute can be paid to the ability\r\nand temper which were brought to the work.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, in truth, an adjustment equally honorable and\r\nadvantageous to all parties. There is not an individual of common sense\r\nor common conscience in Maine or Massachusetts, in the United States or\r\nGreat Britain, who would now wish it disturbed. It took from Maine a\r\ntract of land northwest of the St. John, which the people of Maine\r\nbelieved to belong to them under the treaty of 1783. But it is not\r\nenough that we think ourselves right; the other party thinks the same;\r\nand when there is no common tribunal which both acknowledge, there must\r\nbe compromise. The tract of land in question, for any purpose of\r\ncultivation or settlement, was without value; and had it been otherwise,\r\nit would not have been worth the cost of a naval armament or one\r\nmilitary expedition, to say nothing of the abomination of shedding blood\r\non such an issue. But the disputed title to the worthless tract of\r\nmorass, heath, and rock, covered with snow or fog throughout a great\r\npart of the year, was not ceded gratuitously. We obtained the navigation\r\nof the St. John, the natural outlet of the whole country, without which\r\nthe territory watered by it would have been of comparatively little\r\nvalue; we obtained a good natural boundary as far as the course of the\r\nriver was followed; and we established the line which we claimed at the\r\nhead of the Connecticut, on Lake Champlain, and on the upper lakes;\r\nterritorial objects of considerable interest. Great Britain had equal\r\nreason to be satisfied with the result. For her the territory northwest\r\nof the St. John, worthless to us, had a geographical and political\r\nvalue; it gave her a convenient connection between her provinces, which\r\nwas all she desired. Both sides gained the only object which really was\r\nof importance to either, a settlement by creditable means of a wearisome\r\nnational controversy; an honorable escape from the scourge and curse of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nBoth governments appear to have been fortunate in the constitution of\r\nthe joint commission to survey, run, and mark the long line of\r\nboundary. Mr. Albert Smith, of Maine, was appointed commissioner on\r\nthe part of the United States, with Major James D. Graham, of the United\r\nStates Topographical Engineers as head of a scientific corps, and\r\nMr. Edward Webster[26] as his secretary. On the part of Great\r\nBritain, Lieutenant-Colonel J. B. B. Estcourt, of her Majesty's\r\nservice, was appointed commissioner, with Captain W. H. Robinson, of\r\nthe Royal Engineers, as principal astronomer, and J. Scott, Esq., as\r\nsecretary. Other professional gentlemen were also employed on both\r\nsides. Great harmony characterized all the proceedings and results of\r\nthe commission. The lines were accurately run, and that part of them\r\nnot designated by rivers was marked all the way by substantial cast-iron\r\nmonuments, with suitable inscriptions, at every mile, and at most of\r\nthe principal angles; and wherever the lines extended through\r\nforests, the trees were cut down and cleared to the width of thirty\r\nfeet. All the islands in the St. John were also designated with iron\r\nmonuments, with inscriptions indicating the government to which they\r\nbelonged; and upon that and all other streams forming portions of the\r\nboundary, monuments were erected at the junction of every branch with\r\nthe main river.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to advert to the other great and difficult questions\r\nincluded in this adjustment. The extradition of fugitives from\r\njustice is regarded by Grotius and other respectable authorities as\r\nthe duty of states, by the law of nations. Other authorities reject\r\nthis doctrine;[27] and if it be the law of nations, it requires for\r\nits execution so much administrative machinery as to be of no\r\npractical value without treaty stipulations. The treaty of 1794 with\r\nGreat Britain (Jay's treaty) made provision for a mutual extradition\r\nof fugitives, in cases of murder and forgery; and the case of Jonathan\r\nRobbins, memorable for the argument of Chief Justice Marshall in\r\ndefence of his surrender, gave a political notoriety to that feature of\r\nthe treaty not favorable to its renewal in subsequent negotiations.\r\nThis treaty stipulation expired by its own limitation in 1806.\r\n\r\nBesides the convenience of such an understanding on the part of the two\r\ngreat commercial countries, from which language, personal appearance,\r\nand manners render mutual escape so easy, the condition of the frontier\r\nof the United States and Canada was such as to make this provision all\r\nbut necessary for the preservation of the peace of the two countries. An\r\nextensive secret organization existed in the border States, the object\r\nof which was, under the delusive name of \"sympathy,\" to foment and aid\r\nrebellion in the British Provinces. Although an agreement for mutual\r\nextradition of necessity left untouched a great deal of political\r\nagitation unfriendly to border peace, murder and arson were, of course,\r\nwithin its provisions. It appears from the testimony of the parties best\r\ninformed on the subject, that the happiest consequences flowed from this\r\narticle of the treaty of Washington. No more was heard of border forays,\r\n\"Hunters' Lodges,\" \"Associations for the Liberty of Canada,\" or\r\nviolences offered or retaliated across the line. The mild, but certain\r\ninfluence of law imposed a restraint, which even costly and formidable\r\nmilitary means had not been found entirely adequate to produce.\r\n\r\nThe stipulations for extradition in the treaty of Washington appear to\r\nhave served as a model for those since entered into between the most\r\nconsiderable European powers. A convention for the same purpose was\r\nconcluded between England and France on the 13th of February, 1843, and\r\nother similar compacts have still more recently been negotiated. Between\r\nthe United States and Great Britain the operation of this part of the\r\ntreaty has, in all ordinary cases, been entirely satisfactory. Persons\r\ncharged with the crimes to which its provisions extend have been\r\nmutually surrendered; and the cause of public justice, and in many cases\r\nimportant private interests, have been materially served on both sides\r\nof the water.\r\n\r\nNot inferior in importance and delicacy to the other subjects provided\r\nfor by the treaty was that which concerned the measures for the\r\nsuppression of \"the slave-trade\" on the coast of Africa. In order to\r\nunderstand the difficulties with which Mr. Webster had to contend on\r\nthis subject, a brief history of the question must be given. The law of\r\nnations, as understood and expounded by the most respectable authorities\r\nand tribunals, European and American, recognizes the right of search of\r\nneutral vessels in time of war, by the public ships of the belligerents.\r\nIt recognizes no right of search in time of peace. It makes no\r\ndistinction between a right of visitation and a right of search. To\r\ncompel a trading-vessel, against the will of her commander, to come to\r\nand be boarded, for any purpose whatsoever, is an exercise of the right\r\nof search which the law of nations concedes to belligerents for certain\r\npurposes. To do this in time of peace, under whatever name it may be\r\nexcused or justified, is to perform an act of mere power, for which the\r\nlaw of nations affords no warrant. The moral quality of the action, and\r\nthe estimate formed of it, will of course depend upon circumstances,\r\nmotives, and manner. If an armed ship board a vessel under reasonable\r\nsuspicion that she is a pirate, and when there is no other convenient\r\nmode of ascertaining that point, there would be no cause of blame,\r\nalthough the suspicion turned out to be groundless.\r\n\r\nThe British government, for the praiseworthy purpose of putting a stop\r\nto the traffic in slaves, has at different times entered into\r\nconventions with several of the states of Europe authorizing a mutual\r\nright of search of the trading-vessels of each contracting party by the\r\narmed cruisers of the other party. These treaties give no right to\r\nsearch the vessels of nations not parties to them. But if an armed ship\r\nof either party should search a vessel of a third power under a\r\nreasonable suspicion that she belonged to the other contracting party,\r\nand was pursuing the slave-trade in contravention of the treaty, this\r\nact of power, performed by mistake, and with requisite moderation and\r\ncircumspection in the manner, would not be just ground of offence. It\r\nwould, however, authorize a reasonable expectation of indemnification on\r\nbehalf of the private individuals who might suffer by the detention, as\r\nin other cases of injury inflicted on innocent persons by public\r\nfunctionaries acting with good intentions, but at their peril.\r\n\r\nThe government of the United States, both in its executive and\r\nlegislative branches, has at almost all times manifested an extreme\r\nrepugnance to enter into conventions for a mutual right of search. It\r\nhas not yielded to any other power in its aversion to the slave-trade,\r\nwhich it was the first government to denounce as piracy. The reluctance\r\nin question grew principally out of the injuries inflicted upon the\r\nAmerican commerce, and still more out of the personal outrages in the\r\nimpressment of American seamen, which took place during the wars of\r\nNapoleon, and incidentally to the belligerent right of search and the\r\nenforcement of the Orders in Council and the Berlin and Milan Decrees.\r\nBesides a wholesale confiscation of American property, hundreds of\r\nAmerican seamen were impressed into the ships of war of Great Britain.\r\nSo deeply had the public sensibility been wounded on both points, that\r\nany extension of the right of search by the consent of the United States\r\nwas for a long time nearly hopeless.\r\n\r\nBut this feeling, strong and general as it was, yielded at last to the\r\ndetestation of the slave-trade. Toward the close of the second\r\nadministration of Mr. Monroe the executive had been induced, acting\r\nunder the sanction of resolutions of the two houses of Congress, to\r\nagree to a convention with Great Britain for a mutual right of search of\r\nvessels suspected of being engaged in the traffic. This convention was\r\nnegotiated in London by Mr. Rush on the part of the United States, Mr.\r\nCanning being the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nIn defining the limits within which this right should be exercised, the\r\ncoasts of America were included. The Senate were of opinion that such a\r\nprovision might be regarded as an admission that the slave-trade was\r\ncarried on between the coasts of Africa and the United States, contrary\r\nto the known fact, and to the reproach either of the will or power of\r\nthe United States to enforce their laws, by which it was declared to be\r\npiracy. It also placed the whole coast of the Union under the\r\n_surveillance_ of the cruisers of a foreign power. The Senate,\r\naccordingly, ratified the treaty, with an amendment exempting the coasts\r\nof the United States from the operation of the article. They also\r\nintroduced other amendments of less importance.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the treaty to London thus amended, Mr. Canning gave way\r\nto a feeling of dissatisfaction at the course pursued by the Senate, not\r\nso much on account of any decided objection to the amendment in itself\r\nconsidered, as to the claim of the Senate to introduce any change into a\r\ntreaty negotiated according to instructions. Under the influence of this\r\nfeeling, Mr. Canning refused to ratify the treaty as amended, and no\r\nfurther attempt was at that time made to renew the negotiation.\r\n\r\nIt will probably be admitted on all hands, at the present day, that Mr.\r\nCanning's scruple was without foundation. The treaty had been\r\nnegotiated by this accomplished statesman, under the full knowledge that\r\nthe Constitution of the United States reserves this power to the Senate.\r\nThat it should be exercised was, therefore, no more matter of complaint,\r\nthan that the treaty should be referred at all to the ratification of\r\nthe Senate. The course pursued by Mr. Canning was greatly to be\r\nregretted, as it postponed the amicable adjustment of this matter for\r\neighteen years, not without risk of serious misunderstanding in the\r\ninterval.\r\n\r\nAttempts were made on the part of England, during the ministry of Lord\r\nMelbourne, to renew the negotiation with the United States, but without\r\nsuccess. Conventions between France and England, for a mutual right of\r\nsearch within certain limits, were concluded in 1831 and 1833, under the\r\nministry of the Duc de Broglie, without awakening the public sensibility\r\nin the former country. As these treaties multiplied, the activity of the\r\nEnglish cruisers increased. After the treaty with Portugal, in 1838, the\r\nvessels of that country, which, with those of Spain, were most largely\r\nengaged in the traffic, began to assume the flag of the United States as\r\na protection; and in many cases, also, although the property of vessels\r\nand cargo had, by collusive transfers on the African coast, become\r\nSpanish or Portuguese, the vessels had been built and fitted out in the\r\nUnited States, and too often, it may be feared, with American capital.\r\nVessels of this description were provided with two sets of papers, to be\r\nused as occasion might require.\r\n\r\nHad nothing further been done by British cruisers than to board and\r\nsearch these vessels, whether before or after a transfer of this kind,\r\nno complaint would probably have been made by the government of the\r\nUnited States. But, as many American vessels were engaged in lawful\r\ncommerce on the coast of Africa, it frequently happened that they were\r\nboarded by British cruisers, not always under the command of discreet\r\nofficers. Some voyages were broken up, officers and men occasionally\r\nill-treated, and vessels sent to the United States or Sierra Leone for\r\nadjudication.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 an agreement was made between the officers in command of the\r\nBritish and American squadrons respectively, sanctioning a reciprocal\r\nright of search on the coast of Africa. It will be found among the\r\npapers pertaining to this subject, in the sixth volume of this\r\ncollection. It was a well-meant, but unauthorized step, and was\r\npromptly disavowed by the administration of Mr. Van Buren. Its\r\noperation, while it lasted, was but to increase the existing\r\ndifficulty. Reports of the interruptions experienced by our commerce\r\nin the African waters began greatly to multiply; and there was a\r\nstrong interest on the part of those surreptitiously engaged in the\r\ntraffic to give them currency. A deep feeling began to be manifested\r\nin the country; and the correspondence between the American Minister in\r\nLondon and Lord Palmerston, in the last days of the Melbourne ministry,\r\nwas such as to show that the controversy had reached a critical point.\r\nSuch was the state of the question when Mr. Webster entered the\r\nDepartment of State.\r\n\r\nThe controversy was transmitted, as we have seen, to the new\r\nadministrations on both sides of the water, but soon assumed a somewhat\r\nmodified character. The quintuple treaty, as it was called, was\r\nconcluded at London, on the 20th of December, 1841, by England, France,\r\nAustria, Prussia, and Russia; and information of that fact, as we have\r\nseen above, was given by Lord Aberdeen to Mr. Everett the same day. A\r\nstrong desire was intimated that the United States would join this\r\nassociation of the great powers, but no formal invitation for that\r\npurpose was addressed to them. But the recent occurrences on the coast\r\nof Africa, and the tone of the correspondence above alluded to, had\r\nincreased the standing repugnance of the United States to the\r\nrecognition of a right of search in time of peace.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the same complaints, sometimes just, sometimes\r\nexaggerated, sometimes groundless, had reached France from the coast of\r\nAfrica, and a strong feeling against the right of search was produced in\r\nthat country. The incidents connected with the adjustment of the Syrian\r\nquestion, in 1840, had greatly irritated the French ministry and people,\r\nand the present was deemed a favorable moment for retaliation. On the\r\nassembling of the Chambers, an amendment was moved by M. Lefebvre to the\r\naddress in reply to the king's speech in the following terms: \"We have\r\nalso the confidence, that, in granting its concurrence to the\r\nsuppression of a criminal traffic, your government will know how to\r\npreserve from every attack the interest of our commerce and the\r\nindependence of our flag.\" This amendment was adopted by the unanimous\r\nvote of the Chambers.\r\n\r\nThis was well understood to be a blow aimed at the quintuple treaty. It\r\nwas the most formidable parliamentary check ever encountered by M.\r\nGuizot's administration. It excited profound sensation throughout\r\nEurope. It compelled the French ministry to make the painful sacrifice\r\nof a convention negotiated agreeably to instructions, and not differing\r\nin principle from those of 1831 and 1833, which were consequently\r\nliable to be involved in its fate. The ratification of the quintuple\r\ntreaty was felt to be out of the question. Although it soon appeared\r\nthat the king was determined to sustain M. Guizot, it was by no means\r\napparent in what manner his administration was to be rescued from\r\nthe present embarrassment.\r\n\r\nThe public feeling in France was considerably heightened by various\r\ndocuments which appeared at this juncture, in connection with the\r\ncontroversy between the United States and Great Britain. The President's\r\nmessage and its accompanying papers reached Europe about the period of\r\nthe opening of the session. A very sew days after the adoption of M.\r\nLefebvre's amendment, a pamphlet, written by General Cass, was published\r\nin Paris, and, being soon after translated into French and widely\r\ncirculated, contributed to strengthen the current of public feeling. A\r\nmore elaborate essay was, in the course of the season, published by Mr.\r\nWheaton, the Minister of the United States at Berlin, in which the\r\ntheory of a right of search in time of peace was vigorously assailed.\r\n\r\nThe preceding sketch of the history of the question will show the\r\ndifficulty of the position in reference to this most important interest,\r\nat the time Lord Ashburton's mission was instituted. With what practical\r\ngood sense and high statesmanship the controversy was terminated is well\r\nknown to the country. It is unnecessary here to retrace the steps of the\r\ncorrespondence, to comment on the eighth article of the treaty of\r\nWashington, or to analyze the parliamentary and diplomatic discussions\r\nto which in the following year it gave rise. It is enough to say, that,\r\nunder circumstances of some embarrassment to the Department of State, a\r\ncourse of procedure was happily devised by Mr. Webster, and incorporated\r\ninto the treaty, which, leaving untouched the metaphysics of the\r\nquestion, furnished a satisfactory practical solution of the\r\ndifficulty. Circumstances having made a restatement expedient of the\r\nprinciples maintained by the United States on this most important\r\nsubject, a letter was addressed by Mr. Webster to Mr. Everett, on the\r\n28th of March, 1843, to be read to the British Secretary of State for\r\nForeign Affairs, in which the law of nations applicable to the subject\r\nwas expounded by the American Secretary with a clearness and power which\r\nwill render any further discussion of the subject, under its present\r\naspects, entirely superfluous. Nor will it be thought out of place to\r\nacknowledge the fairness, good temper, and ability with which the\r\ndoctrine and practice of the English government were sustained by the\r\nEarl of Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom with which the eighth article of the treaty was drawn up was\r\nsoon seen in its consequences. Its effect was decisive. It put a stop to\r\nall discontent at home in reference to the interruption of our lawful\r\ncommerce on the coast of Africa. Abroad, it raised the jealousy already\r\nexisting in France on this subject to the point of uncontrollable\r\nrepugnance. The ratification of the quintuple treaty had long been\r\nabandoned. It was soon evident that the conventions of 1831 and 1833\r\nmust be given up. In the course of the year 1844, the Duc de Broglie,\r\nthe honorable and accomplished minister by whom they had been\r\nnegotiated, accepted a special mission to London, for the purpose of\r\ncoming to some satisfactory arrangement by way of substitute, and a\r\nconvention was soon concluded with the British government on precisely\r\nthe same principles with those of the treaty of Washington.\r\n\r\nIt may be hoped that the important suggestion of Mr. Webster will be\r\nborne in mind, in any future discussions of this and other maritime\r\nquestions, that the policy of the United States is not that of a feeble\r\nnaval power interested in exaggerating the doctrine of neutral\r\ninviolability. A respect for every independent flag is a common interest\r\nof all civilized states, powerful or weak; but the rank of the United\r\nStates among naval powers, and their position as the great maritime\r\npower on the western coasts of the Atlantic and the eastern coasts of\r\nthe Pacific, may lead them to doubt the expediency of pressing too far\r\nthe views they have hitherto held, and moderate their anxiety to\r\nconstrue with extreme strictness the rights which the law of nations\r\nconcedes to public vessels.\r\n\r\nThe three subjects on which we have dwelt, namely, the northeastern\r\nboundary, the extradition of fugitives, and the suppression of the\r\nslave-trade, were the only ones which required to be provided for by\r\ntreaty stipulation. Other subjects, scarcely less important and fully as\r\ndifficult were happily disposed of in the correspondence of the\r\nplenipotentiaries. These were the affair of the \"Caroline,\" that of the\r\n\"Creole,\" and the question of impressment. Our limits do not permit us\r\nto dwell at length on these topics; but we shall be pardoned for one or\r\ntwo reflections.\r\n\r\nSo urgent is the pressure on the public mind of the successive events\r\nwhich demand attention each as it presents itself, that the formidable\r\ndifficulties growing out of the destruction of the \"Caroline\" and the\r\narrest of McLeod are already fading from recollection. They formed, in\r\nreality, a crisis of a most serious and delicate character. A glance at\r\nthe correspondence of the two governments at Washington and London\r\nsufficiently shows this to be the case. The violation of the territory\r\nof the United States in the destruction of the \"Caroline,\" however\r\nunwarrantable the conduct of the \"sympathizers\" which provoked it,\r\nbecame, from the moment the British government assumed the\r\nresponsibility of the act, an incident of the gravest character. On the\r\nother hand, the inability of the government of the United States to\r\nextricate McLeod from the risks of a capital trial in a State court,\r\nalthough the government of England demanded his liberation on the ground\r\nthat he was acting under the legal orders of his superior, presented a\r\ndifficulty in the working of our system equally novel and important.\r\nOther cases had arisen in which important constitutional principles had\r\nfailed to take effect, for want of the requisite legislative provisions.\r\nIt is believed that this was the first time in which a difficulty of\r\nthis kind had presented itself in our foreign relations. A more\r\nthreatening one can scarcely be imagined. In addition to the\r\nembarrassment occasioned by the refusal of the executive and judiciary\r\nof New York to yield to the representations of the general government,\r\nthe violent interference of the mob presented new difficulties of the\r\nmost deplorable character. If McLeod had been executed, it is not too\r\nmuch to say, that war would at once have ensued. His acquittal averted\r\nthis impending danger. The conciliatory spirit cannot be too warmly\r\ncommended with which, on the one hand, the proper reparation was made by\r\nLord Ashburton for the violation of the American territory, and, on the\r\nother hand, Congress, by the passage of an appropriate law, provided an\r\neffectual legislative remedy for any future similar case. They show with\r\nwhat simplicity and ease the greatest evils may be averted, and the most\r\ndesirable ends achieved, by statesmen and governments animated by a\r\nsincere desire to promote the welfare of those who have placed power in\r\ntheir hands, not for selfish, party purposes, but for the public good.\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no one of the papers written by Mr. Webster as\r\nSecretary of State, in which so much force of statement and power of\r\nargument are displayed as in the letter on \"impressment.\" To incorporate\r\na stipulation on this subject into a treaty was, regarding the\r\nantecedents of the question, impracticable. But the reply of Lord\r\nAshburton to Mr. Webster's announcement of the American principle must\r\nbe considered as acquiescence on the part of his government. It may be\r\ndoubted whether this odious and essentially illegal practice will ever\r\nagain be systematically resorted to, even in England.[28] Considering\r\nthe advance made by public sentiment an all questions connected with\r\npersonal liberty, \"a hot-press on the Thames\" would hardly stand the\r\nordeal of an investigation in Parliament at the present day. It is\r\ncertain that the right of impressing seamen from American vessels could\r\nnever be practically asserted in a future war with any other effect than\r\nthat of adding the United States to the parties in the contest. No\r\nrefinements in the doctrine of natural allegiance, although their\r\ntheoretical soundness might equal their subtilty, would be of the least\r\navail here. To force seamen from the deck of a peaceful neutral vessel,\r\npursuing a lawful commerce, and compel them to serve for an indefinite\r\nand hopeless period on board a foreign man-of-war, is an act of power\r\nand violence to which no nation will submit that is able to resist it.\r\nIn the case of the United States and Great Britain, that community of\r\nlanguage and resemblance in general appearance which may have been\r\nconsidered as palliating the most deplorable results of the exercise of\r\nthis power, in reality constitute the strongest reason for its\r\nabandonment. The unquestionable danger that, with the best intentions,\r\nthe boarding officer may mistake an American for an Englishman; the\r\ncertainty that a reckless lieutenant, unmindful of consequences, but\r\nbent upon recruiting his ship on a remote foreign station, will pretend\r\nto believe that he is seizing the subjects of his own government,\r\nwhatever may be the evidence to the contrary, are reasons of themselves\r\nfor denying on the threshold the existence of a right exposed to such\r\ninevitable and intolerable abuse.\r\n\r\nThese and other views of the subject are presented in Mr. Webster's\r\nletter to Lord Ashburton of the 8th of August, 1842, with a strength of\r\nreasoning and force of illustration not often equalled in a state paper.\r\nThat letter was spoken of, in the hearing of the writer of this memoir,\r\nby one whose name, if it could be mentioned with propriety, would give\r\nthe highest authority to the remark, as a composition not surpassed by\r\nany thing in the language. The principles laid down in it may be\r\nconsidered as incorporated into the public law of the United States, and\r\nwill have their influence beyond our own territorial limits and beyond\r\nour own time.\r\n\r\nSome disappointment was probably felt, when the treaty of Washington was\r\npublished, that a settlement of the Oregon question was not included\r\namong its provisions. It need not be said that a subject of such\r\nmagnitude did not escape the attention of the negotiators. It was,\r\nhowever, speedily inferred by Mr. Webster, from the purport of his\r\ninformal conferences with Lord Ashburton on this point, that an\r\narrangement of this question was not then practicable, and that to\r\nattempt it would be to put the entire negotiation to great risk of\r\nfailure. On the other hand, it was not less certain that, by closing up\r\nthe other matters in controversy, the best preparation was made for\r\nbringing the Oregon dispute to an amicable issue, whenever circumstances\r\nshould favor that undertaking. Considerable firmness was no doubt\r\nrequired to act upon this policy, and to forego the attempt, at least,\r\nto settle a question rapidly growing into the most formidable magnitude.\r\nIt is unnecessary to say how completely the course adopted has been\r\njustified by the event.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have in the preceding remarks confined ourselves to the topics\r\nconnected with the treaty of Washington. But other subjects of great\r\nimportance connected with the foreign affairs of the country engaged the\r\nattention of Mr. Webster as Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThe first of these pertained to our controversies with Mexico, and was\r\ntreated in a letter to M. de Bocanegra, the Mexican Secretary of State\r\nand Foreign Relations. The great and unexpected changes which have taken\r\nplace in that quarter since the date of this correspondence will not\r\nimpair the interest with which it will be read. It throws important\r\nlight on the earlier stages of our controversy with that ill-advised and\r\ninfatuated government. Among the papers in this part of the volume are\r\nthose which relate to the Santa Fe prisoners and Captain Jones's attack\r\non Monterey.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of \"Relations with Spain\" will be found a correspondence\r\nof great interest between the Chevalier d'Argaiz, the representative of\r\nthat government, and Mr. Webster, on the subject of the \"Amistad.\" The\r\npertinacity with which this matter was pursued by Spain, after its\r\nadjudication by the Supreme Court of the United States, furnishes an\r\ninstructive commentary upon the sincerity of that government in its\r\nmeasures for the abolition of the slave-trade. The entire merits of this\r\nimportant and extraordinary case are condensed in Mr. Webster's letters\r\nof the 1st of September, 1841, and 21st of June, 1842.\r\n\r\nOf still greater interest are the institution of the mission to China,\r\nand the steps which led to the establishment of the independence of the\r\nSandwich Islands. The sixth volume of this collection contains the\r\ninstructions given to Mr. Cushing as commissioner to China, and the\r\ncorrespondence between Mr. Webster and Messrs. Richards and Haalilio on\r\nbehalf of the Sandwich Islands. At any period less crowded with\r\nimportant events the opening of diplomatic relations with China, and the\r\nconclusion of a treaty of commerce with that power, would have been\r\ndeemed occurrences of unusual importance. It certainly reflects great\r\ncredit on the administration, that it acted with such promptitude and\r\nefficiency in seizing this opportunity of multiplying avenues of\r\ncommercial intercourse. Nor is less praise due to the energy and skill\r\nof the negotiator,[29] to whom this novel and important undertaking was\r\nconfided, and who was able to embark from China, on his return homeward,\r\nin six months after his arrival, having in the mean time satisfactorily\r\nconcluded the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe application of the representatives of the Sandwich Islands to the\r\ngovernment of the United States, and the countenance extended to them at\r\nWashington, exercised a most salutary and seasonable influence over the\r\ndestiny of those islands. The British government was promptly made aware\r\nof the course pursued by the United States, and was no doubt led, in a\r\nconsiderable degree, by this circumstance, to promise the Hawaiian\r\ndelegates, on the part of England, to respect the independent neutrality\r\nof their government. In the mean time, the British admiral on that\r\nstation had taken provisional possession of them on behalf of his\r\ngovernment, in anticipation of a similar movement which was expected on\r\nthe part of France. If intelligence of this occurrence had been received\r\nin London before the promise above alluded to was given by Lord Aberdeen\r\nto Messrs. Richards and Haalilio, it is not impossible that Great\r\nBritain might have felt herself warranted in retaining the protectorate\r\nof the Hawaiian Islands as an offset for the occupation of Tahiti by the\r\nFrench. As it was, the temporary arrangement of the British admiral was\r\ndisavowed, and the government restored to the native chief.\r\n\r\nAmong the papers contained in the sixth volume will be found a\r\ncorrespondence between Mr. Webster and the Portuguese Minister, on the\r\nsubject of duties on Portuguese wines, and a report of great importance\r\non the Sound duties and the Zoll-Verein, topics to which the recent\r\nchanges in the Germanic system will henceforward impart a greatly\r\nincreased importance.\r\n\r\nThis brief enumeration will of itself sufficiently show the extensive\r\nrange of the subjects to which the attention of Mr. Webster was called,\r\nduring the two years for which he filled the Department of State.\r\n\r\nThe published correspondence probably forms but a small portion of the\r\nofficial labors of the Department of State for the period during which\r\nit was filled by Mr. Webster. They constitute, nevertheless, the most\r\nimportant part of the documentary record of a period of official\r\nservice, brief, indeed, but as beneficial to the country as any of which\r\nthe memory is preserved in her annals. The administration of General\r\nHarrison found the United States, in the spring of 1841, on the verge of\r\na war, not with a feeble Spanish province, scarcely capable of a\r\nrespectable resistance, but with the most powerful government on earth.\r\nThe conduct of our foreign relations was intrusted to Mr. Webster, as\r\nSecretary of State, and in the two years during which he filled that\r\noffice controversies of fifty years' standing were terminated, new\r\ncauses of quarrel that sprung up like hydra's heads were settled, and\r\npeace was preserved upon honorable terms. The British government, fresh\r\nfrom the conquest of China, perhaps never felt itself stronger than in\r\nthe year 1842, and a full share of credit is due to the spirit of\r\nconciliation which swayed its counsels. Much is due to the wise and\r\namiable minister who was despatched from England on the holy errand of\r\npeace; much to the patriotism of the Senate of the United States, who\r\nconfirmed the treaty of Washington by a larger majority than ever before\r\nsustained a measure of this kind which divided public opinion; but the\r\nfirst meed of praise is unquestionably due to the American negotiator.\r\nLet the just measure of that praise be estimated, by reflecting what\r\nwould have been our condition during the last few years, if, instead of,\r\nor in addition to, the war with Mexico, we had been involved in a war\r\nwith Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [23] This chapter is republished, with but slight modifications, from\r\n        the volume of Mr. Webster's Diplomatic and Official Papers which\r\n        appeared in 1848, to which it served as the Introduction.\r\n\r\n   [24] Mr. Stevenson.\r\n\r\n   [25] Senate Papers, Twenty-seventh Congress, First Session, No. 33.\r\n\r\n   [26] Younger son of Mr. Webster, who died in Mexico, in 1848, being a\r\n        major in the regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers.\r\n\r\n   [27] The authorities are given in Story's Commentaries Vol. III. pp.\r\n        675, 676; Conflict of Laws, pp. 520, 522; and in Kent's\r\n        Commentaries, Vol. I. pp. 36, 37.\r\n\r\n   [28] The following passage from a letter of Robert Walsh, Esq., to the\r\n        editors of the National Intelligencer, dated Paris, 28th\r\n        October, 1842, furnishes confirmation of the remark in the\r\n        text:--\r\n\r\n        \"The former journal [The Times], of the 18th instant,\r\n        acknowledges that Mr. Webster 'has not exaggerated the\r\n        hardships and evils which the practice of impressment\r\n        occasioned in the last war.' It ratifies his ideas of the\r\n        probable aggravation of them, if the practice should be ever\r\n        renewed; it would even dispense with press-warrants at home, as\r\n        adverse to the general principles of British liberty and law:\r\n        it advises some general measure for the entire abolition of\r\n        arbitrary impressment both at home and abroad, and it expresses\r\n        its belief of a very strong probability, that, in the event\r\n        of a war, no instructions for the impressment of British\r\n        seamen found in American merchant-vessels will be issued to her\r\n        Majesty's cruisers. The Standard chimes with the great oracle,\r\n        and concludes in this strain: 'We may infer that, whatever\r\n        may be the plan hereafter for managing our navy, impressment\r\n        will never again be resorted to; this is beyond a doubt: _the\r\n        practice complained of by Mr. Webster will be abandoned_.'\"\r\n\r\n   [29] Mr. Cushing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Webster resigns his Place in Mr. Tyler's Cabinet.--Attempts to\r\n  draw public Attention to the projected Annexation of\r\n  Texas.--Supports Mr. Clay's Nomination for the Presidency.--Causes\r\n  of the Failure of that Nomination.--Mr. Webster returns to the\r\n  Senate of the United States.--Admission of Texas to the Union.--The\r\n  War with Mexico.--Mr. Webster's Course in Reference to the\r\n  War.--Death of Major Webster in Mexico.--Mr. Webster's unfavorable\r\n  Opinion of the Mexican Government.--Settlement of the Oregon\r\n  Controversy.--Mr. Webster's Agency in effecting the\r\n  Adjustment.--Revival of the Sub-Treasury System and Repeal of the\r\n  Tariff Law of 1842.--Southern Tour.--Success of the Mexican War and\r\n  Acquisition of the Mexican Provinces.--Efforts in Congress to\r\n  organize a Territorial Government for these Provinces.--Great\r\n  Exertions of Mr. Webster on the last Night of the\r\n  Session.--Nomination of General Taylor, and Course of Mr. Webster in\r\n  Reference to it.--A Constitution of State Government adopted by\r\n  California prohibiting Slavery.--Increase of Antislavery\r\n  Agitation.--Alarming State of Affairs.--Mr. Webster's Speech for the\r\n  Union.--Circumstances under which it was made, and Motives by which\r\n  he was influenced.--General Taylor's Death, and the Accession of Mr.\r\n  Fillmore to the Presidency.--Mr. Webster called to the Department of\r\n  State.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Webster remained in the Department of State but a little over two\r\nyears. His last act was the preparation of the instructions of Mr.\r\nCushing, who had been appointed Commissioner to China. Difficulties had\r\noccurred the summer before, between President Tyler and some of the\r\nmembers of his Cabinet, and all of those gentlemen, with the exception\r\nof Mr. Webster, tendered their resignations, which were accepted. Hard\r\nthoughts were entertained of Mr. Webster in some quarters for continuing\r\nto hold his seat after the resignation of his colleagues. President\r\nTyler, however, had in no degree withdrawn his confidence from Mr.\r\nWebster in reference to the foreign affairs of the country, nor\r\ninterfered with the administration of his department, and Mr. Webster\r\nconceived that the interests involved in his remaining at his post were\r\nfar too important to be sacrificed to punctilio. His own sense of duty\r\nin this respect was confirmed by the unanimous counsel of the\r\nMassachusetts delegation in Congress, and by judicious friends in all\r\nparts of the country. In fact, it will be remembered that when\r\ndifficulties sprung up between Mr. Tyler and the Whig party in Congress,\r\nin 1842, the Whig press generally throughout the country called upon the\r\nmembers of the Cabinet appointed by General Harrison to retain their\r\nplaces till they should be removed by Mr. Tyler.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster remained in private life during the residue of President\r\nTyler's administration, occupied as usual with professional pursuits,\r\nand enjoying in the appropriate seasons the retirement of his farm. He\r\nendeavored by private communications to arouse the feeling of the North\r\nto the projects which he perceived to be in agitation for the annexation\r\nof Texas but the danger was regarded at that time as too remote to be\r\ncontended against. A short time only elapsed before the fulfilment of\r\nhis anticipations was forced upon the country, with fearful urgency, and\r\na train of consequences of which it will be left to a late posterity to\r\nwitness the full development. Between the years 1843 and 1845 the\r\nfortunes of the United States were subjected to an influence, for good\r\nor for evil, not to be exhausted for centuries.\r\n\r\nThe nomination of Mr. Clay to the Presidency in 1844 was cordially\r\nsupported by Mr. Webster. He took the field, as in the summer of 1840 in\r\nfavor of General Harrison. The proofs of the untiring zeal with which he\r\nentered into the canvass, and of the great power and fertility with\r\nwhich he discussed the various topics of the day, will be seen in the\r\nsecond volume of the present collection. It has, however, been found\r\nimpossible to insert more than a selection of the speeches made by him\r\nduring the campaign. Others not inferior in merit and interest were made\r\nby him in the course of the summer and autumn of 1844.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the result of this election was decisive of the\r\nquestion of the annexation of Texas. The opinions expressed by Mr. Van\r\nBuren against the immediate consummation of that project had prevented\r\nhis receiving the nomination of the Baltimore Convention. Mr. Clay was\r\npledged against the measure, and Mr. Polk was selected as its sure\r\nfriend. If in 1844 the friends of Mr. Van Buren, instead of giving in\r\ntheir adhesion to the Baltimore nomination (which was in fact turning\r\nthe scale in favor of Texas), had been prepared, as in 1848, to support\r\na separate nomination, or even if the few thousand votes cast by the\r\n\"Liberty party\" against Mr. Clay had been given in his favor, he would\r\nhave been chosen President of the United States, to the indefinite\r\npostponement of the annexation of Texas and the Mexican war, with all\r\ntheir consequences. But in great things as in small, men throw away the\r\nsubstance while they grasp at the shadow.\r\n\r\nAt the first session of the Twenty-ninth Congress (1845-46), Mr. Webster\r\ntook his seat as the successor of Mr. Choate in the Senate of the United\r\nStates. The question of the admission of Texas was decided at the very\r\ncommencement of the session. It was opposed by Mr. Webster. To all the\r\nother objections to the measure in his mind was added that of\r\nunconstitutionality. The annexation was now brought about simply by a\r\njoint resolution of the two houses, after it had been found impossible\r\nto effect it by treaty, the only form known to the Constitution by which\r\na compact can be entered into with a foreign power. Mr. Jefferson was of\r\nopinion in 1803, that even a treaty with France was not sufficient for\r\nthe annexation of Louisiana, but that an amendment of the Constitution\r\nwas necessary for that purpose. In 1845 the executive and a majority of\r\nCongress, having failed to carry the ratification of a treaty of\r\nannexation by the constitutional majority, scrupled not to accomplish\r\ntheir purpose by a joint resolution of the two houses; and this measure\r\nwas effected under the lead of statesmen who claim to construe the\r\nConstitution with literal strictness. Events like these furnish a\r\npainful illustration of the frailty of constitutional restraints as a\r\nbarrier against the consummation of the favorite measures of a dominant\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nThe great event of the administration of President Polk was the war with\r\nMexico. The time has not yet arrived when the counsels under which this\r\nwar was brought about can be fully unfolded. On the 2d of December,\r\n1845, in his first annual message, having communicated to Congress the\r\nacceptance by Texas of the terms of annexation offered by the joint\r\nresolution, President Polk thus expressed himself:--\r\n\r\n  \"This accession to our territory has been a bloodless achievement.\r\n  No arm of force has been raised to produce the result. The sword has\r\n  had no part in the victory. We have not sought to extend our\r\n  territorial possessions by conquest, or our republican institutions\r\n  over a reluctant people. It was the deliberate homage of each people\r\n  to the great principle of our federative Union.\"\r\n\r\nThe proffered annexation of Texas had been declined both by General\r\nJackson and Mr. Van Buren, on the ground that, unless made with the\r\nconsent of Mexico, it would involve a war with that power. That this\r\nwould be the effect was not less certain on the 2d of December, 1845,\r\nwhen Congress were congratulated on the \"bloodless\" acquisition, than it\r\nwas when, on the 13th of January following, General Taylor was\r\ninstructed to occupy the left bank of the Rio del Norte. In fact, in the\r\nvery message in which President Polk remarks to Congress \"that the sword\r\nhad had no part in the victory,\" he gives them also the significant\r\ninformation, that, upon the earnest appeal both of the Congress and\r\nconvention of Texas, he had ordered \"an efficient military force to take\r\na position between the Nueces and the Del Norte.\"\r\n\r\nThis force, however efficient in proportion to its numbers and in virtue\r\nof the gallantry and skill of its commander, was found to be inadequate\r\nto sustain the brunt of the Mexican arms. Rapid movements on the part of\r\nGenerals Ampudia and Arista, commanding on the frontier, seriously\r\nendangered the safety of General Taylor's force, and it became necessary\r\nfor Congress to strengthen it by prompt reinforcements. In this way the\r\nwar was commenced. No formal declaration had taken place, nor had it\r\nbeen in the power of Congress to make known its will on the subject,\r\ntill an absolute necessity arose of reinforcing General Taylor, and the\r\nsubject had ceased to be one for legislative discretion.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it was of course impossible for Mr. Webster to\r\napprove the war. It had been brought on by the executive will, and\r\nwithout the concurrence of Congress till Congress had ceased to have an\r\noption, and its well-known ulterior objects were such as he could not\r\nbut contemplate with equal disapprobation and alarm. Still, however, in\r\ncommon with the body of his political friends, in and out of Congress,\r\nhe abstained from all factious opposition, and all measures calculated\r\nto embarrass the government. The supplies were voted for by him, but he\r\nnever ceased to urge upon the President to pursue a magnanimous policy\r\ntoward the distracted and misgoverned country with which we had been\r\nbrought in collision. Nor did his opinions of the character of the war\r\nlead him to discourage the inclination of his younger son, Mr. Edward\r\nWebster, to accept a commission in the regiment of Massachusetts\r\nVolunteers. This young gentleman had evinced an energy beyond his years,\r\nand practical talent of a high order, as a member of the commission for\r\nmarking the boundary line between Maine and the British Provinces under\r\nthe treaty of Washington. His friends looked forward with confidence to\r\nhis running a brilliant military career. These hopes, like those which\r\naccompanied so many other gallant and patriotic spirits to the scene of\r\naction, were destined to be early blasted. Major Webster fell a victim\r\nto the labors and exposures of the service, and to the climate of the\r\ncountry, under the walls of Mexico.\r\n\r\nTo avoid all misconception, it may be proper to state that Mr. Webster\r\nhas at all times entertained an unfavorable opinion of the various\r\nadministrations by which Mexico, almost ever since her revolution, has\r\nbeen successively misgoverned. He has felt constrained to regard the\r\ngreater part of them as military factions, bent more upon supplanting\r\neach other than upon promoting the welfare of their country. He was\r\nfully aware of the justice of many of the complaints of citizens of the\r\nUnited States for wrongs inflicted and justice withheld. Both while in\r\nthe executive government himself, and as a member of Congress, he had\r\nuniformly expressed himself in terms of severe condemnation of the\r\nconduct of the Mexican government in withholding or delaying redress;\r\nand he foresaw and foretold that, in obstinately refusing to recognize\r\nthe independence of Texas, she was laying up for herself a store of\r\nconsequences the most humiliating and disastrous. Nothing but the most\r\ndeplorable infatuation could have led the government of Mexico to\r\nsuppose, that, after the independence of Texas had been recognized by\r\nthe United States, Great Britain, France, and Belgium, it would be\r\npossible for a power as feeble as that of Mexico to reduce the\r\nrebellious province to submission. If any confirmation of these\r\nstatements is needed, it may be found in Mr. Webster's letter to Mr. de\r\nBocanegra, in the sixth volume of this collection.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the controversy with England relative to the boundary\r\nof Oregon was effected in the first year of Mr. Polk's administration.\r\nThe foundations for this adjustment had long been laid; in fact, as long\r\nago as the administration of Mr. Monroe, the United States had offered\r\nto England the obvious basis of the extension of the forty-ninth degree\r\nof latitude to the Pacific. Great Britain allowed herself to be\r\ninfluenced by the Hudson's Bay Company so far, as to insist upon\r\nfollowing the course of the Columbia down to the sea. She even took the\r\nextravagant ground that, although the United States, by the Louisiana\r\nand Florida treaties, combined the Spanish and the French titles with\r\nthat of actual contiguity and prior discovery of the Columbia River,\r\nthey had no exclusive title to any portion of the territory, but that it\r\nwas all subject to her own joint and rival claim. This unreasonable\r\npretension brought the two countries to the verge of war. The Baltimore\r\nConvention, in the year 1844, set up a claim, equally unreasonable, to\r\nthe whole of the territory. President Polk in his inaugural message,\r\nquoting the words of the resolution of the Baltimore Convention,\r\npronounced our title to the territory to be \"clear and unquestionable.\"\r\n\r\nThe assertion of these opposite extremes of pretension happily resulted\r\nin the final adjustment on the forty-ninth degree. Mr. Webster had\r\nuniformly been of opinion that this was the fair basis of settlement.\r\nHad he supposed that an arrangement could have been effected on this\r\nbasis with Lord Ashburton, he would gladly have included it in the\r\ntreaty of Washington. After Mr. Webster's retirement from the Department\r\nof State, it is stated by President Polk that Mr. Upshur instructed Mr.\r\nEverett to offer that line to the British government; but the\r\nnegotiation had in the mean time, by the appointment of Mr. Pakenham,\r\nbeen transferred to Washington. The offer of the forty-ninth degree of\r\nlatitude was renewed to Mr. Pakenham, but accompanied with conditions\r\nwhich led him to decline it, and to express the hope that the United\r\nStates would make \"some further proposal for the settlement of the\r\nOregon question more consistent with fairness and equity, and with the\r\nreasonable expectations of the British government.\" The offer thus\r\ninjudiciously rejected was withdrawn by the administration. In this\r\ndangerous juncture of affairs, the following incidents occurred, which\r\nwe give in the words of the \"London Examiner\":\r\n\r\n  \"In reply to a question put to him in reference to the present war\r\n  establishments of this country, and the propriety of applying the\r\n  principle of arbitration in the settlement of disputes arising among\r\n  nations, Mr. McGregor, one of the candidates for the representation\r\n  of Glasgow, took occasion to narrate the following very important\r\n  and remarkable anecdote in connection with our recent, but now\r\n  happily terminated differences with the United States on the Oregon\r\n  question. At the time our ambassador at Washington, the Hon. Mr.\r\n  Pakenham, refused to negotiate on the forty-ninth parallel of north\r\n  latitude as the basis of a treaty, and when by that refusal the\r\n  danger of a rupture between Great Britain and America became really\r\n  imminent, Mr. Daniel Webster, formerly Secretary of State to the\r\n  American government, wrote a letter to Mr. McGregor, in which he\r\n  strongly deprecated Mr. Pakenham's conduct, which, if persisted in\r\n  and adopted at home, would, to a certainty, embroil the two\r\n  countries, and suggested an equitable compromise, taking the\r\n  forty-ninth parallel as the basis of an adjustment. Mr. McGregor\r\n  agreeing entirely with Mr. Webster in the propriety of a mutual\r\n  giving and taking to avoid a rupture, and the more especially as the\r\n  whole territory in dispute was not worth L20,000 to either power,\r\n  while the preparations alone for a war would cost a great deal more\r\n  before the parties could come into actual conflict, communicated the\r\n  contents of Mr. Webster's letter to Lord John Russell, who at the\r\n  time was living in the neighborhood of Edinburgh, and, in reply,\r\n  received a letter from Lord John, in which he stated his entire\r\n  accordance with the proposal recommended by Mr. Webster, and\r\n  approved of by Mr. McGregor, and requested the latter, as he (Lord\r\n  John) was not in a position to do it himself, to intimate his\r\n  opinion to Lord Aberdeen. Mr. McGregor, through Lord Canning,\r\n  Under-Secretary for the Foreign Department, did so, and the result\r\n  was, that the first packet that left England carried out to America\r\n  the proposal, in accordance with the communication already referred\r\n  to, on which the treaty of Oregon was happily concluded. Mr.\r\n  McGregor may, therefore, be very justly said to have been the\r\n  instrument of preserving the peace of the world; and for that alone,\r\n  even if he had no other services to appeal to, he has justly earned\r\n  the applause and admiration, not of his own countrymen only, but of\r\n  all men who desire to promote the best interests of the human\r\n  race.\"\r\n\r\nWithout wishing to detract in any degree from the praise due to Mr.\r\nMcGregor for his judicious and liberal conduct on this occasion, the\r\ncredit of the main result is exclusively due to his American\r\ncorrespondent. A powerful influence was ascribed also to an able article\r\nin the Edinburgh Review for April, 1845, in which the reasonableness of\r\nthis basis of settlement was set forth with great ability.\r\n\r\nThe first session of the Twenty-ninth Congress was signalized by the\r\nrevival of the sub-treasury system, and the overthrow of the tariff of\r\n1842. At a moment when the public finances were, in reference to the\r\nmeans of collection, custody, and transfer, in a sound and healthy\r\ncondition, the administration deemed it expedient to subject the country\r\nand the treasury to the hazard and inconvenience of a change. Mr.\r\nWebster spoke with equal earnestness and power against the renewal of\r\nexperiments which had already proved so disastrous; but the bill was\r\ncarried by a party vote. The same success attended the President's\r\nrecommendation of an entire change in the revenue system, by which,\r\ninstead of specific duties, _ad valorem_ duties were to be assessed on\r\nthe foreign valuation. Various other changes were made in the tariff\r\nestablished in 1842, equally tending to depress our own manufactures,\r\nand to give a preference to foreign over native labor, and this even in\r\ncases where no benefit could be expected to accrue to the treasury from\r\nthe change. Mr. Webster made a truly Herculean effort against the\r\ngovernment project, in his speech of the 25th and 26th of July, 1846,\r\nbut the decree had gone forth. The scale was turned by the Senators from\r\nthe new State of Texas, which had been brought into the Union by the\r\nvotes of members of Congress whose constituents had the deepest interest\r\nin sustaining the tariff of 1842.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1847, after the adjournment of Congress, Mr. Webster\r\nundertook a tour to the South. His object was to pass by the way of the\r\nAtlantic States to New Orleans, and to ascend the Mississippi. He had\r\nnever seen that part of the Union, and promised himself equal\r\ngratification and instruction from an opportunity, however brief, of\r\npersonal inspection. He was ever of opinion that higher motives than\r\nthose of curiosity and recreation should lead the citizens of different\r\nparts of the country to the interchange of visits of this kind. That\r\nthey had become so much less frequent than they were in former years he\r\nregarded as one of the inauspicious features of the times. He was\r\naccompanied on this excursion by his family. They passed hastily through\r\nVirginia and North Carolina to South Carolina. At Charleston he was\r\nreceived with the most distinguished attention and cordiality. He was\r\nwelcomed on his arrival by an assemblage of the most respectable\r\ncitizens. Entertainments were given him by the New England Society of\r\nCharleston and by the Charleston Bar. At these festivals the sentiments\r\nand speeches were of the most cordial description. Similar hospitalities\r\nand honors were paid him at Columbia, Augusta, and Savannah. No trace of\r\nsectional or party feeling detracted from the warmth of his reception.\r\nHis visit was everywhere regarded as an interesting public event.\r\nUnhappily, his health failed him on his arrival at Savannah; and the\r\nadvance of the season made it impossible for him to execute the original\r\nproject of a journey to New Orleans. He was compelled to hasten back to\r\nthe North.\r\n\r\nMeantime events of higher importance were in progress. Success crowned\r\nour arms in the Mexican war. The military skill, gallantry, and\r\nindomitable resolution of the great captains to whom the chief command\r\nof the war had been committed, (though not by the first choice of the\r\nadministration,) aided by the spirit and discipline of the troops,\r\nachieved the conquest of Mexico. Peace was dictated to her from\r\nWashington, and a treaty concluded, by which extensive portions of her\r\nterritory, comprising the province of New Mexico and a considerable part\r\nof California, were ceded to the United States. Mr. Webster, foreseeing\r\nthat these cessions would prove a Pandora's box of discord and strife\r\nbetween the different sections of the Union, voted against the\r\nratification of the treaty. He was sustained in this course by some\r\nSouthern Whig Senators, but the constitutional majority deemed any\r\ntreaty better than the continuation of the war.\r\n\r\nWith the restoration of peace, the question what should be done with the\r\nterritories presented itself with alarming prominence. Formidable under\r\nany circumstances, it became doubly so in consequence of the discovery\r\nof gold in California, and the prodigious rush to that quarter of\r\nadventurers from every part of the world. Population flocked into and\r\ntook possession of the country, its ancient political organization,\r\nfeeble at best, was subverted, and the immediate action of Congress was\r\nnecessary to prevent a state of anarchy. The House of Representatives\r\npassed a bill providing for the organization of a territorial government\r\nfor the provinces newly acquired from Mexico, with the antislavery\r\nproviso, borrowed from the Ordinance of 1787. This bill failed to pass\r\nthe Senate, and nothing was done at the first session of the Thirtieth\r\nCongress to meet the existing emergency in California.\r\n\r\nAt the second session, bills were introduced into the Senate for\r\nerecting California and New Mexico into States; the question of slavery\r\nto be left to the people of the States respectively. These bills,\r\nhowever, did not pass the Senate. A few days before the close of the\r\nsession, Mr. Walker of Wisconsin moved an amendment to the general\r\nappropriation bill for the support of government, providing for the\r\nextension of the revenue laws of the United States over California and\r\nNew Mexico; to extend the provisions of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates to these territories, together with all the laws applicable to\r\nthem; and granting authority to the President to appoint the officers\r\nnecessary to carry these provisions into effect. This amendment\r\nprevailed in the Senate, but was further amended in the House, by adding\r\nto it the \"Wilmot Proviso.\" The Senate refused to accede to this\r\namendment of their amendment, and the two houses were brought to the\r\nverge of a disagreement, which would have prevented the passage of the\r\ngeneral appropriation bill, and stopped the wheels of government. The\r\ndebates in the Senate were of the most impassioned kind, and were\r\nprotracted till five o'clock of Sunday morning, the 4th of March; when\r\nthe Senate, on the suggestion of Mr. Webster, disagreed to the amendment\r\nof the House relative to California, and at the same time receded from\r\ntheir own amendment, and thus passed the general appropriation bill, as\r\nit originally came from the House. All provision for the territories was\r\nnecessarily sacrificed by this course; but a bill which had previously\r\npassed the House, extending the revenue laws of the United States to\r\nCalifornia, was passed by the Senate, and rescued the people of\r\nCalifornia from an entire destitution of government on behalf of the\r\nUnited States. The Senate on this occasion was, for the first time since\r\nthe adoption of the Constitution, on the verge of disorganization; and\r\nit was felt throughout the day and night, that it was saved from falling\r\ninto that condition mainly by the parliamentary tact and personal\r\ninfluence of Mr. Webster. This tribute was paid to Mr. Webster's arduous\r\nexertions on that occasion by a member of Congress warmly opposed to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNot the least important consequence of the Mexican war was the political\r\nrevolution in the United States of which it was the cause. When the\r\npolicy of invading and conquering Mexico was determined upon, it was\r\nprobably regarded by the administration as a measure calculated to\r\nstrengthen their party. Opponents were likely to expose themselves to\r\nodium by disapproving the war. The commanding generals were both Whigs,\r\nand one of them had been named as a candidate for the Presidency. It was\r\nprobably thought that, if they succeeded, the glory would accrue to the\r\nadministration; if they failed, the discredit would fall upon\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIf anticipations like these were formed, they were signally\r\ndisappointed. A series of the most brilliant triumphs crowned the arms\r\nboth of General Taylor and General Scott. Those of General Taylor were\r\nfirst in time; and as they had been preceded by doubts, anxieties, and,\r\nin the case of Buena Vista, by rumors of disaster, they took the\r\nstronger hold of the public mind. The nomination for the Presidency was\r\nnot reserved for the Whig convention. It was in effect made at Palto\r\nAlto and Monterey, and was confirmed at Buena Vista. It was a movement\r\nof the people to which resistance was in vain.\r\n\r\nStatesmen and civilians, however, might well pause for a moment. The\r\nlate experience of the country, under a President elected in consequence\r\nof military popularity, was not favorable to a repetition of the\r\nexperiment; and General Taylor was wholly unknown in political life. At\r\nthe Whig convention in Philadelphia other distinguished Whigs, General\r\nScott, Mr. Clay, and Mr. Webster, had divided the votes with General\r\nTaylor. He was, however, selected by a great majority as the candidate\r\nof the party. Mr. Webster took the view of this nomination which might\r\nhave been expected from a veteran statesman and a civilian of forty\r\nyears' experience in the service of the country. He had, in common with\r\nthe whole Whig party, in General Jackson's case, opposed the nomination\r\nof a military chieftain. How many Whigs who hailed General Taylor's\r\nnomination with enthusiasm had as good reasons for so doing as Mr.\r\nWebster had for the moderation and reserve with which he spoke of it in\r\nhis Marshfield speech? Few persons, at the present day, will find in\r\nthat speech any thing, with respect to General Taylor's nomination, from\r\nwhich a candid and impartial judgment would dissent; and it is well\r\nknown, that, in the progress of the canvass, that nomination found no\r\nfirmer supporter than Mr. Webster. On his accession to the Presidency,\r\nGeneral Taylor found Mr. Webster disposed and prepared to give his\r\nadministration a cordial and efficient support.\r\n\r\nIn the summer and autumn of 1849 events of the utmost importance\r\noccurred in California. The people of that region, left almost entirely\r\nwithout a government by Congress, met in convention to form a\r\nconstitution; and although nearly half of the members who were\r\nnew-comers were from the Southern States, they unanimously agreed to the\r\nprohibition of slavery. The constitution prepared by the convention was\r\naccepted by the people, and with it they applied for admission to the\r\nUnion. General Riley, who had been appointed by the President to command\r\nthe forces in that territory, was instructed to facilitate, as far as it\r\nwas in his power, the assembling of a convention; and the course pursued\r\nby the convention and the people in the formation of the constitution\r\nwas understood to be in all respects approved by President Taylor.\r\n\r\nOther occurrences, however, had in the mean time taken place, which\r\nmaterially increased the difficulties attending the territorial\r\nquestion. The subject of slavery had for fifteen or twenty years been\r\nagitated with steadily increasing warmth, and for the latter portion of\r\nthe period with growing violence. On the acquisition of the Mexican\r\nprovinces, the representatives of the non-slaveholding States generally\r\ndeemed it their duty to introduce into the acts passed for their\r\ngovernment a restriction analogous to the antislavery proviso of the\r\nOrdinance of 1787. A motion to this effect having been made by Mr.\r\nWilmot of Pennsylvania, by way of amendment to one of the appropriation\r\nbills passed during the war, the restriction has obtained the name of\r\nthe \"Wilmot Proviso.\" This motion in the House of Representatives was\r\nextensively seconded by the press, by popular assemblies, and by\r\nlegislative resolutions throughout the non-slaveholding States, and\r\ncaused a considerable increase of antislavery agitation.\r\n\r\nThe South, of course, took an interest in the question not inferior\r\nto that of the North. The extension of the United States on the\r\nsouthwestern frontier has long been a cardinal point in the policy of\r\nmost Southern statesmen. The application of an antislavery proviso to\r\nterritories acquired by conquest in that quarter came into direct\r\nconflict with this policy. Meetings were accordingly held at\r\nWashington during the first session of the Thirtieth Congress,\r\nattended by a majority of the members from the slaveholding States,\r\nto take into consideration the measures proper to be adopted. At one\r\nof these meetings a sub-committee was appointed, of which Mr. Calhoun\r\nwas chairman, to prepare an address \"of the Southern delegates to their\r\nconstituents.\" At a subsequent meeting a substitute for this address\r\nwas submitted by Mr. Berrien of Georgia, under the title of an address\r\n\"to the people of the United States.\" The original paper was,\r\nhowever, adopted in preference, and received the signatures of\r\nforty-eight of the members of Congress from the slaveholding States. Of\r\nthese all but two were of the Democratic party.[30]\r\n\r\nThese proceedings contributed materially to increase the discontents\r\nexisting at the South. Nor was the progress of excitement less rapid at\r\nthe North. The nomination of General Taylor by the Whig convention,\r\naccompanied by the refusal of that convention to countenance the Wilmot\r\nProviso, led to the organization of the Free Soil party in the\r\nnon-slaveholding States. In the summer of 1848, a convention of\r\ndelegates of this party assembled at Buffalo in New York, at which an\r\nantislavery platform was adopted, and Mr. Van Buren was nominated as a\r\ncandidate for the Presidency.\r\n\r\nThese occurrences and the state of feeling which they created, or\r\nindicated, appeared to Mr. Webster to constitute a crisis in the\r\ncondition of the country of a most formidable description. Opinion\r\nat the North and South had, in his judgment, either reached, or was\r\nrapidly reaching, a point at which the cooeperation of the two\r\nsections of the country in carrying on the government as coequal\r\nmembers of the Federal Union would cease to be practicable. The\r\nconstitutional opinions and the views on the subject of slavery set\r\nforth in Mr. Calhoun's address he deemed to be such as could never be\r\nacquiesced in by the non-slaveholding States. On the other hand, the\r\norganization of a party on the basis of antislavery agitation at the\r\nNorth appeared to him equally menacing to the Union. The professions\r\nof attachment to the Union and the Constitution made on both sides,\r\nand often, no doubt, in entire good faith, did but increase the\r\ndanger, by their tendency to produce misapprehension and self-deception\r\nas to the really irreconcilable nature of the opposite extremes of\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nIt was his profound and anxious sense of the dangers of the Union, in\r\nthis crisis of affairs, which reconciled Mr. Webster to the nomination\r\nof General Taylor. He saw in his position as a citizen of a Southern\r\nState and a slaveholder the basis of support to his administration from\r\nthat quarter of the Union; while his connection with the Whig party, the\r\nknown moderation of his views, with his declared sentiments on the\r\nsubject of the Presidential veto, were a sufficient ground for the\r\nconfidence of the North. In fact, in the existing state of things, it\r\nwas soon apparent that there was no other candidate of either party so\r\nwell calculated to allay sectional differences, and guide the vessel of\r\nstate over the stormy sea of excitement and agitation.\r\n\r\nBut whatever reliance might justly have been placed upon the character\r\nand disposition of General Taylor, the prospect of affairs was\r\nsufficiently dark and inauspicious. Thoughtful persons looked forward to\r\na struggle on the territorial question, at the first session of the\r\nThirty-first Congress, which would convulse the country. In this state\r\nof things the event which we have already alluded to took place, and\r\nCalifornia presented herself for admission as a State, with a\r\nconstitution prohibiting slavery. As California was the only portion of\r\nthe Mexican territory in reference to which the question was of\r\npractical importance, Mr. Webster derived from this unexpected and\r\nseasonable occurrence a gleam of hope. It removed a topic of controversy\r\nin reference to which it had seemed hopeless to propose any terms of\r\ncompromise; and it opened, as it were providentially, the door for an\r\nunderstanding on other points, on the basis of carrying into execution\r\nexisting compacts and constitutional provisions on the one hand, and not\r\nstrenuously insisting, on the other hand, upon applying the antislavery\r\nproviso where, as in Utah and New Mexico, he was persuaded it could be\r\nof no practical importance.\r\n\r\nOn these principles, and with this object in view, Mr. Webster made his\r\ngreat speech of the 7th of March, 1850.\r\n\r\nIt would be too much to expect, in reference to a subject of so much\r\ndifficulty, and one on which the public mind has been so greatly\r\nexcited, that a speech of this description should find universal favor\r\nin any part of the country. It is believed, however, that by the\r\nmajority of patriotic and reflecting citizens in every part of the\r\nUnited States, while on single topics there may be differences of\r\nopinion, it has been regarded as holding out a practical basis for the\r\nadjustment of controversies, which had already gone far to dissolve the\r\nUnion, and could not be much longer pursued without producing that\r\nresult. If those who have most strongly expressed their dissent from the\r\ndoctrines of the speech (we do not, of course, allude to the mere clamor\r\nof political or personal enemies) will pause from the work of\r\ndenunciation, and make the attempt themselves to lay down _a practicable\r\nplatform_ on which this great controversy can in fact be settled, and\r\nthe union of the States perpetuated, they will not find it so hard to\r\ncensure what is done by others as to do better themselves. It is quite\r\neasy to construct a Southern platform or a Northern platform; the\r\ndifficulty is to find a basis on which South and North will be able and\r\n_willing_ to stand together. Of all those who have condemned the views\r\nof Mr. Webster, who has gone further than he, in the speech of the 7th\r\nof March, 1850, to furnish such a basis? Or rather, we may ask, who of\r\nthose that have been loudest in condemnation of his course has taken a\r\nsingle step towards effecting this paramount object?\r\n\r\nMr. Webster's thoughts are known to have been earnestly and profoundly\r\nemployed on this subject from the commencement of the session. He saw\r\nbeforehand the difficulties and the dangers incident to the step which\r\nhe adopted, but he believed that, unless some such step was taken in the\r\nNorth, the separation of the States was inevitable. The known state of\r\nopinion of leading members of Congress led him to look for little\r\nsupport from them. He opened the matter to some of his political\r\nfriends, but they did not encourage him in the course he felt bound to\r\npursue. He found that he could not expect the cooeperation of the members\r\nof Congress from his own State, nor that of many of the members from the\r\nother Northern States. He gave up all attempt to rally beforehand a\r\nparty which would sustain him. His own description of his feelings at\r\nthe time was, \"that he had made up his mind to embark alone on what he\r\nwas aware would prove a stormy sea, because, in that case, should final\r\ndisaster ensue, there would be but one life lost.\" But he believed that\r\nthe step which he was about to take would be sanctioned by the mass of\r\nthe people, and in that reliance he went forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the compromise measures were still undecided before Congress,\r\nabout midsummer of 1850, President Taylor was removed from his high\r\noffice by death. In the reorganization of the executive occasioned by\r\nthis event, Mr. Webster, to the general satisfaction of the country, was\r\nplaced by President Fillmore at the head of the administration.\r\nSubsequent events are too recent to need to be described. The\r\ncorrespondence with the Austrian Charge d'Affaires is the worthy\r\ncomplement, after an interval of a quarter of a century, to the profound\r\ndiscussion of international politics contained in the speech of January,\r\n1824, on the revolution in Greece, and that of 1826, on the Congress of\r\nPanama. We have before us a translation of this correspondence furtively\r\npublished in Germany, and circulated throughout the Austrian empire. The\r\nfervid appeals to the patriotism of the people, with which Mr. Webster\r\nhas electrified the Union on various occasions during the last nine\r\nmonths, have contributed materially to the great work of sectional\r\nconciliation; and his last noble effort, on laying the corner-stone of\r\nthe Capitol, will be read with admiration as long as the Capitol itself\r\nshall last.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch, in a brief and imperfect narrative, is the public life of Mr.\r\nWebster, extending over a period of forty years, marked by the\r\noccurrence of events of great importance. It has been the aim of the\r\nwriter to prevent the pen of the biographer from being too much\r\ninfluenced by the partiality of the friend. Should he seem to the\r\ncandid not wholly to have escaped that error, (which, however, he\r\ntrusts will not be the case,) he ventures to hope that it will be\r\nforgiven to an intimacy which commenced in the youth of one of the\r\nparties and the boyhood of the other, and which has subsisted for\r\nnearly half a century. It will be admitted, he thinks, by every one,\r\nthat this career, however inadequately delineated, has been one of\r\nsingular eminence and brilliancy. Entering upon public life at the\r\nclose of the first epoch in the political history of the United\r\nStates under the present Constitution, Mr. Webster has stood below\r\nnone of the distinguished men who have impressed their character on the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nThere is a class of public questions in reference to which the opinions\r\nof most men are greatly influenced by prejudices founded in natural\r\ntemperament, early association, and real or supposed local interest. As\r\nfar as such questions are concerned, it is too much to hope that, in\r\ntimes of high party excitement, full justice will be done to prominent\r\nstatesmen by those of their contemporaries who differ from them. We\r\ngreatly err, however, if candid men of all parties, and in all parts of\r\nthe country, do not accord to Mr. Webster the praise of having formed to\r\nhimself a large and generous view of the character of an American\r\nstatesman, and of having adopted the loftiest standard of public\r\nconduct. They will agree that he has conceived, in all its importance,\r\nthe position of the country as a member of the great family of nations,\r\nand as the leading republican government. In reference to domestic\r\npolitics it will be as generally conceded, that, reposing less than most\r\npublic men on a party basis, it has been the main object of his life to\r\nconfirm and perpetuate the great work of the constitutional fathers of\r\nthe last generation.\r\n\r\nBy their wisdom and patriotic forethought we are blessed with a system\r\nin which the several States are brought into a union so admirably\r\ncomposed and balanced,--both complicated and kept distinct with such\r\nskill,--as to seem less a work of human prudence than of Providential\r\ninterposition.[31] Mr. Webster has at all times been fully aware of the\r\nevils of anarchy, discord, and civil war at home, and of utter national\r\ninsignificance abroad, from which the formation of the Union saved us.\r\nHe has been not less sensible to the obstacles to be overcome the perils\r\nto be encountered, and the sufferings to be borne, before this wonderful\r\nframework of government could be established. And he has been firmly\r\npersuaded that, if once destroyed, it can never be reconstructed. With\r\nthese views, his political life has been consecrated to the maintenance\r\nin all their strength of the principles on which the Constitution\r\nrests, and to the support of the system of government created by it.\r\n\r\nThe key to his whole political course is the belief that, when the Union\r\nis dissolved, the internal peace, the vigorous growth, and the\r\nprosperity of the States, and the welfare of their inhabitants, are\r\nblighted for ever, and that, while the Union endures, all else of trial\r\nand calamity which can befall a nation may be remedied or borne. So\r\nbelieving, he has pursued a course which has earned for him an honored\r\nname among those who have discharged the duty of good citizens with the\r\nmost distinguished ability, zeal, and benefit to the country. In the\r\nrelations of civilized life, there is no higher service which man can\r\nrender to man, than thus to preserve a wise constitution of government\r\nin healthful action. Nor does the most eloquent of the statesmen of\r\nantiquity content himself with pronouncing this the highest human merit.\r\nIn that admirable treatise on the Republic, of which some precious\r\nchapters have been restored to us after having been lost for ages, he\r\ndoes not hesitate to affirm, that there is nothing in which human virtue\r\napproaches nearer the divine, than in establishing and preserving\r\nstates: \"neque enim ulla res est, in qua propius ad deorum numen virtus\r\naccedat humana, quam civitates aut condere novas aut conservare jam\r\nconditas.\"[32]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [30] In compiling this narrative much use has been made of the third\r\n        volume of the work entitled \"The Statesman's Manual,\" a most\r\n        useful work of reference.\r\n\r\n   [31] This idea is beautifully expressed in the following passage of a\r\n        late letter from Mr. Webster, in reply to an invitation from the\r\n        citizens of Macon, Georgia:--\r\n\r\n        \"The States are united, not consolidated;\r\n\r\n          'Not, chaos-like, together crashed and bruised,\r\n          But, like the world, harmoniously confused,\r\n          Where order in variety we see;\r\n          And where, though all things differ, all agree.'\"\r\n\r\n   [32] M. Tulli Ciceronis de Re Publica quae supersunt, edente Angelo\r\n        Maio. Lib. I. Sec. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST SETTLEMENT OF NEW ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE.\r\n\r\nThe first public anniversary celebration of the landing of the Pilgrims\r\nat Plymouth took place under the auspices of the \"Old Colony Club,\"\r\nof whose formation an account may be found in the interesting little\r\nwork of William S. Russell, Esq., entitled \"Guide to Plymouth and\r\nRecollections of the Pilgrims.\"\r\n\r\nThis club was formed for general purposes of social intercourse, in\r\n1769; but its members determined, by a vote passed on Monday the 18th of\r\nDecember of that year, \"to keep\" Friday, the 22d, in commemoration of\r\nthe landing of the fathers. A particular account of the simple\r\nfestivities of this first public celebration of the landing of the\r\nPilgrims will be found at page 220 of Mr. Russell's work.\r\n\r\nThe following year, the anniversary was celebrated much in the same\r\nmanner as in 1769, with the addition of a short address, pronounced\r\n\"with modest and decent firmness, by a member of the club, Edward\r\nWinslow, Jr., Esq.,\" being the first address ever delivered on this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nIn 1771, it was suggested by Rev. Chandler Robbins, pastor of the First\r\nChurch at Plymouth, in a letter addressed to the club, \"whether it would\r\nnot be agreeable, for the entertainment and instruction of the rising\r\ngeneration on these anniversaries, to have a sermon in public, some part\r\nof the day, peculiarly adapted to the occasion.\" This recommendation\r\nprevailed, and an appropriate discourse was delivered the following year\r\nby the Rev. Dr. Robbins.\r\n\r\nIn 1773 the Old Colony Club was dissolved, in consequence of the\r\nconflicting opinions of its members on the great political questions\r\nthen agitated. Notwithstanding this event, the anniversary celebrations\r\nof the 22d of December continued without interruption till 1780, when\r\nthey were suspended. After an interval of fourteen years, a public\r\ndiscourse was again delivered by the Rev. Dr. Robbins. Private\r\ncelebrations took place the four following years, and from that time\r\ntill the year 1819, with one or two exceptions, the day was annually\r\ncommemorated, and public addresses were delivered by distinguished\r\nclergymen and laymen of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 the \"Pilgrim Society\" was formed by the citizens of Plymouth and\r\nthe descendants of the Pilgrims in other places, desirous of uniting \"to\r\ncommemorate the landing, and to honor the memory of the intrepid men who\r\nfirst set foot on Plymouth rock.\" The foundation of this society gave a\r\nnew impulse to the anniversary celebrations of this great event. The\r\nHon. Daniel Webster was requested to deliver the public address on the\r\n22d of December of that year, and the following discourse was pronounced\r\nby him on the ever-memorable occasion. Great public expectation was\r\nawakened by the fame of the orator; an immense concourse assembled at\r\nPlymouth to unite in the celebration; and it may be safely anticipated,\r\nthat some portion of the powerful effect of the following address on the\r\nminds of those who were so fortunate as to hear it, will be perpetuated\r\nby the press to the latest posterity.\r\n\r\nFrom 1820 to the present day, with occasional interruptions, the 22d of\r\nDecember has been celebrated by the Pilgrim Society. A list of all those\r\nby whom anniversary discourses have been delivered since the first\r\norganization of the Old Colony Club, in 1769, may be found in Mr.\r\nRussell's work.\r\n\r\nNor has the notice of the day been confined to New England. Public\r\ncelebrations of the landing of the Pilgrims have been frequent in other\r\nparts of the country, particularly in New York. The New England Society\r\nof that city has rarely permitted the day to pass without appropriate\r\nhonors. Similar societies have been formed at Philadelphia, Charleston,\r\nS. C., and Cincinnati, and the day has been publicly commemorated in\r\nseveral other parts of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST SETTLEMENT OF NEW ENGLAND.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us rejoice that we behold this day. Let us be thankful that we have\r\nlived to see the bright and happy breaking of the auspicious morn, which\r\ncommences the third century of the history of New England. Auspicious,\r\nindeed,--bringing a happiness beyond the common allotment of Providence\r\nto men,--full of present joy, and gilding with bright beams the prospect\r\nof futurity, is the dawn that awakens us to the commemoration of the\r\nlanding of the Pilgrims.\r\n\r\nLiving at an epoch which naturally marks the progress of the history of\r\nour native land, we have come hither to celebrate the great event with\r\nwhich that history commenced. For ever honored be this, the place of our\r\nfathers' refuge! For ever remembered the day which saw them, weary and\r\ndistressed, broken in every thing but spirit, poor in all but faith and\r\ncourage, at last secure from the dangers of wintry seas, and impressing\r\nthis shore with the first footsteps of civilized man!\r\n\r\nIt is a noble faculty of our nature which enables us to connect our\r\nthoughts, our sympathies, and our happiness with what is distant in\r\nplace or time; and, looking before and after, to hold communion at once\r\nwith our ancestors and our posterity. Human and mortal although we are,\r\nwe are nevertheless not mere insulated beings, without relation to the\r\npast or the future. Neither the point of time, nor the spot of earth, in\r\nwhich we physically live, bounds our rational and intellectual\r\nenjoyments. We live in the past by a knowledge of its history; and in\r\nthe future by hope and anticipation. By ascending to an association with\r\nour ancestors; by contemplating their example and studying their\r\ncharacter; by partaking their sentiments, and imbibing their spirit; by\r\naccompanying them in their toils, by sympathizing in their sufferings,\r\nand rejoicing in their successes and their triumphs; we seem to belong\r\nto their age, and to mingle our own existence with theirs. We become\r\ntheir contemporaries, live the lives which they lived, endure what they\r\nendured, and partake in the rewards which they enjoyed. And in like\r\nmanner, by running along the line of future time, by contemplating the\r\nprobable fortunes of those who are coming after us, by attempting\r\nsomething which may promote their happiness, and leave some not\r\ndishonorable memorial of ourselves for their regard, when we shall sleep\r\nwith the fathers, we protract our own earthly being, and seem to crowd\r\nwhatever is future, as well as all that is past, into the narrow compass\r\nof our earthly existence. As it is not a vain and false, but an exalted\r\nand religious imagination, which leads us to raise our thoughts from the\r\norb, which, amidst this universe of worlds, the Creator has given us to\r\ninhabit, and to send them with something of the feeling which nature\r\nprompts, and teaches to be proper among children of the same Eternal\r\nParent, to the contemplation of the myriads of fellow-beings, with which\r\nhis goodness has peopled the infinite of space; so neither is it false\r\nor vain to consider ourselves as interested and connected with our whole\r\nrace, through all time; allied to our ancestors; allied to our\r\nposterity; closely compacted on all sides with others; ourselves being\r\nbut links in the great chain of being, which begins with the origin of\r\nour race, runs onward through its successive generations, binding\r\ntogether the past, the present, and the future, and terminating at last,\r\nwith the consummation of all things earthly, at the throne of God.\r\n\r\nThere may be, and there often is, indeed, a regard for ancestry, which\r\nnourishes only a weak pride; as there is also a care for posterity,\r\nwhich only disguises an habitual avarice, or hides the workings of a low\r\nand grovelling vanity. But there is also a moral and philosophical\r\nrespect for our ancestors, which elevates the character and improves the\r\nheart. Next to the sense of religious duty and moral feeling, I hardly\r\nknow what should bear with stronger obligation on a liberal and\r\nenlightened mind, than a consciousness of alliance with excellence which\r\nis departed; and a consciousness, too, that in its acts and conduct,\r\nand even in its sentiments and thoughts, it may be actively operating on\r\nthe happiness of those who come after it. Poetry is found to have few\r\nstronger conceptions, by which it would affect or overwhelm the mind,\r\nthan those in which it presents the moving and speaking image of the\r\ndeparted dead to the senses of the living. This belongs to poetry, only\r\nbecause it is congenial to our nature. Poetry is, in this respect, but\r\nthe handmaid of true philosophy and morality; it deals with us as human\r\nbeings, naturally reverencing those whose visible connection with this\r\nstate of existence is severed, and who may yet exercise we know not what\r\nsympathy with ourselves; and when it carries us forward, also, and shows\r\nus the long continued result of all the good we do, in the prosperity of\r\nthose who follow us, till it bears us from ourselves, and absorbs us in\r\nan intense interest for what shall happen to the generations after us,\r\nit speaks only in the language of our nature, and affects us with\r\nsentiments which belong to us as human beings.\r\n\r\nStanding in this relation to our ancestors and our posterity, we are\r\nassembled on this memorable spot, to perform the duties which that\r\nrelation and the present occasion impose upon us. We have come to this\r\nRock, to record here our homage for our Pilgrim Fathers; our sympathy in\r\ntheir sufferings; our gratitude for their labors; our admiration of\r\ntheir virtues; our veneration for their piety; and our attachment to\r\nthose principles of civil and religious liberty, which they encountered\r\nthe dangers of the ocean, the storms of heaven, the violence of savages,\r\ndisease, exile, and famine, to enjoy and to establish. And we would\r\nleave here, also, for the generations which are rising up rapidly to\r\nfill our places, some proof that we have endeavored to transmit the\r\ngreat inheritance unimpaired; that in our estimate of public principles\r\nand private virtue, in our veneration of religion and piety, in our\r\ndevotion to civil and religious liberty, in our regard for whatever\r\nadvances human knowledge or improves human happiness, we are not\r\naltogether unworthy of our origin.\r\n\r\nThere is a local feeling connected with this occasion, too strong to be\r\nresisted; a sort of _genius of the place_, which inspires and awes us.\r\nWe feel that we are on the spot where the first scene of our history was\r\nlaid; where the hearths and altars of New England were first placed;\r\nwhere Christianity, and civilization, and letters made their first\r\nlodgement in a vast extent of country, covered with a wilderness, and\r\npeopled by roving barbarians. We are here, at the season of the year at\r\nwhich the event took place. The imagination irresistibly and rapidly\r\ndraws around us the principal features and the leading characters in the\r\noriginal scene. We cast our eyes abroad on the ocean, and we see where\r\nthe little bark, with the interesting group upon its deck, made its slow\r\nprogress to the shore. We look around us, and behold the hills and\r\npromontories where the anxious eyes of our fathers first saw the places\r\nof habitation and of rest. We feel the cold which benumbed, and listen\r\nto the winds which pierced them. Beneath us is the Rock,[34] on which\r\nNew England received the feet of the Pilgrims. We seem even to behold\r\nthem, as they struggle with the elements, and, with toilsome efforts,\r\ngain the shore. We listen to the chiefs in council; we see the\r\nunexampled exhibition of female fortitude and resignation; we hear the\r\nwhisperings of youthful impatience, and we see, what a painter of our\r\nown has also represented by his pencil,[35] chilled and shivering\r\nchildhood, houseless, but for a mother's arms, couchless, but for a\r\nmother's breast, till our own blood almost freezes. The mild dignity of\r\nCARVER and of BRADFORD; the decisive and soldierlike air and manner of\r\nSTANDISH; the devout BREWSTER; the enterprising ALLERTON;[36] the\r\ngeneral firmness and thoughtfulness of the whole band; their conscious\r\njoy for dangers escaped; their deep solicitude about dangers to come;\r\ntheir trust in Heaven; their high religious faith, full of confidence\r\nand anticipation; all of these seem to belong to this place, and to be\r\npresent upon this occasion, to fill us with reverence and admiration.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of New England by the colony which landed here[37] on the\r\ntwenty-second[38] of December, sixteen hundred and twenty, although not\r\nthe first European establishment in what now constitutes the United\r\nStates, was yet so peculiar in its causes and character, and has been\r\nfollowed and must still be followed by such consequences, as to give it\r\na high claim to lasting commemoration. On these causes and consequences,\r\nmore than on its immediately attendant circumstances, its importance, as\r\nan historical event, depends. Great actions and striking occurrences,\r\nhaving excited a temporary admiration, often pass away and are\r\nforgotten, because they leave no lasting results, affecting the\r\nprosperity and happiness of communities. Such is frequently the fortune\r\nof the most brilliant military achievements. Of the ten thousand battles\r\nwhich have been fought, of all the fields fertilized with carnage, of\r\nthe banners which have been bathed in blood, of the warriors who have\r\nhoped that they had risen from the field of conquest to a glory as\r\nbright and as durable as the stars, how few that continue long to\r\ninterest mankind! The victory of yesterday is reversed by the defeat of\r\nto-day; the star of military glory, rising like a meteor, like a meteor\r\nhas fallen; disgrace and disaster hang on the heels of conquest and\r\nrenown; victor and vanquished presently pass away to oblivion, and the\r\nworld goes on in its course, with the loss only of so many lives and so\r\nmuch treasure.\r\n\r\nBut if this be frequently, or generally, the fortune of military\r\nachievements, it is not always so. There are enterprises, military as\r\nwell as civil, which sometimes check the current of events, give a new\r\nturn to human affairs, and transmit their consequences through ages. We\r\nsee their importance in their results, and call them great, because\r\ngreat things follow. There have been battles which have fixed the fate\r\nof nations. These come down to us in history with a solid and permanent\r\ninterest, not created by a display of glittering armor, the rush of\r\nadverse battalions, the sinking and rising of pennons, the flight, the\r\npursuit, and the victory; but by their effect in advancing or retarding\r\nhuman knowledge, in overthrowing or establishing despotism, in extending\r\nor destroying human happiness. When the traveller pauses on the plain of\r\nMarathon, what are the emotions which most strongly agitate his breast?\r\nWhat is that glorious recollection, which thrills through his frame, and\r\nsuffuses his eyes? Not, I imagine, that Grecian skill and Grecian valor\r\nwere here most signally displayed; but that Greece herself was saved. It\r\nis because to this spot, and to the event which has rendered it\r\nimmortal, he refers all the succeeding glories of the republic. It is\r\nbecause, if that day had gone otherwise, Greece had perished. It is\r\nbecause he perceives that her philosophers and orators, her poets and\r\npainters, her sculptors and architects, her governments and free\r\ninstitutions, point backward to Marathon, and that their future\r\nexistence seems to have been suspended on the contingency, whether the\r\nPersian or the Grecian banner should wave victorious in the beams of\r\nthat day's setting sun. And, as his imagination kindles at the\r\nretrospect, he is transported back to the interesting moment; he counts\r\nthe fearful odds of the contending hosts; his interest for the result\r\noverwhelms him; he trembles, as if it were still uncertain, and seems to\r\ndoubt whether he may consider Socrates and Plato, Demosthenes,\r\nSophocles, and Phidias, as secure, yet, to himself and to the world.\r\n\r\n\"If we conquer,\" said the Athenian commander on the approach of that\r\ndecisive day, \"if we conquer, we shall make Athens the greatest city of\r\nGreece.\"[39] A prophecy, how well fulfilled! \"If God prosper us,\" might\r\nhave been the more appropriate language of our fathers, when they landed\r\nupon this Rock, \"if God prosper us, we shall here begin a work which\r\nshall last for ages; we shall plant here a new society, in the\r\nprinciples of the fullest liberty and the purest religion; we shall\r\nsubdue this wilderness which is before us; we shall fill this region of\r\nthe great continent, which stretches almost from pole to pole, with\r\ncivilization and Christianity; the temples of the true God shall rise,\r\nwhere now ascends the smoke of idolatrous sacrifice; fields and gardens,\r\nthe flowers of summer, and the waving and golden harvest of autumn,\r\nshall spread over a thousand hills, and stretch along a thousand\r\nvalleys, never yet, since the creation, reclaimed to the use of\r\ncivilized man. We shall whiten this coast with the canvas of a\r\nprosperous commerce; we shall stud the long and winding shore with a\r\nhundred cities. That which we sow in weakness shall be raised in\r\nstrength. From our sincere, but houseless worship, there shall spring\r\nsplendid temples to record God's goodness; from the simplicity of our\r\nsocial union, there shall arise wise and politic constitutions of\r\ngovernment, full of the liberty which we ourselves bring and breathe;\r\nfrom our zeal for learning, institutions shall spring which shall\r\nscatter the light of knowledge throughout the land, and, in time, paying\r\nback where they have borrowed, shall contribute their part to the great\r\naggregate of human knowledge; and our descendants, through all\r\ngenerations, shall look back to this spot, and to this hour, with\r\nunabated affection and regard.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA brief remembrance of the causes which led to the settlement of\r\nthis place; some account of the peculiarities and characteristic\r\nqualities of that settlement, as distinguished from other instances\r\nof colonization; a short notice of the progress of New England in the\r\ngreat interests of society, during the century which is now elapsed;\r\nwith a few observations on the principles upon which society and\r\ngovernment are established in this country; comprise all that can be\r\nattempted, and much more than can be satisfactorily performed, on the\r\npresent occasion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the motives which influenced the first settlers to a voluntary exile,\r\ninduced them to relinquish their native country, and to seek an asylum\r\nin this then unexplored wilderness, the first and principal, no doubt,\r\nwere connected with religion. They sought to enjoy a higher degree of\r\nreligious freedom, and what they esteemed a purer form of religious\r\nworship, than was allowed to their choice, or presented to their\r\nimitation, in the Old World. The love of religious liberty is a stronger\r\nsentiment, when fully excited, than an attachment to civil or political\r\nfreedom. That freedom which the conscience demands, and which men feel\r\nbound by their hope of salvation to contend for, can hardly fail to be\r\nattained. Conscience, in the cause of religion and the worship of the\r\nDeity, prepares the mind to act and to suffer beyond almost all other\r\ncauses. It sometimes gives an impulse so irresistible, that no fetters\r\nof power or of opinion can withstand it. History instructs us that this\r\nlove of religious liberty, a compound sentiment in the breast of man,\r\nmade up of the clearest sense of right and the highest conviction of\r\nduty, is able to look the sternest despotism in the face, and, with\r\nmeans apparently most inadequate, to shake principalities and powers.\r\nThere is a boldness, a spirit of daring, in religious reformers, not to\r\nbe measured by the general rules which control men's purposes and\r\nactions. If the hand of power be laid upon it, this only seems to\r\naugment its force and its elasticity, and to cause its action to be more\r\nformidable and violent. Human invention has devised nothing, human power\r\nhas compassed nothing, that can forcibly restrain it, when it breaks\r\nforth. Nothing can stop it, but to give way to it; nothing can check it,\r\nbut indulgence. It loses its power only when it has gained its object.\r\nThe principle of toleration, to which the world has come so slowly, is\r\nat once the most just and the most wise of all principles. Even when\r\nreligious feeling takes a character of extravagance and enthusiasm, and\r\nseems to threaten the order of society and shake the columns of the\r\nsocial edifice, its principal danger is in its restraint. If it be\r\nallowed indulgence and expansion, like the elemental fires, it only\r\nagitates, and perhaps purifies, the atmosphere; while its efforts to\r\nthrow off restraint would burst the world asunder.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, that, although many of them were republicans in\r\nprinciple, we have no evidence that our New England ancestors would have\r\nemigrated, as they did, from their own native country, would have become\r\nwanderers in Europe, and finally would have undertaken the establishment\r\nof a colony here, merely from their dislike of the political systems of\r\nEurope. They fled not so much from the civil government, as from the\r\nhierarchy, and the laws which enforced conformity to the church\r\nestablishment. Mr. Robinson had left England as early as 1608, on\r\naccount of the persecutions for nonconformity, and had retired to\r\nHolland. He left England, from no disappointed ambition in affairs of\r\nstate, from no regrets at the want of preferment in the church, nor from\r\nany motive of distinction or of gain. Uniformity in matters of religion\r\nwas pressed with such extreme rigor, that a voluntary exile seemed the\r\nmost eligible mode of escaping from the penalties of noncompliance. The\r\naccession of Elizabeth had, it is true, quenched the fires of\r\nSmithfield, and put an end to the easy acquisition of the crown of\r\nmartyrdom. Her long reign had established the Reformation, but\r\ntoleration was a virtue beyond her conception, and beyond the age. She\r\nleft no example of it to her successor; and he was not of a character\r\nwhich rendered it probable that a sentiment either so wise or so liberal\r\nwould originate with him. At the present period it seems incredible,\r\nthat the learned, accomplished, unassuming, and inoffensive Robinson\r\nshould neither be tolerated in his peaceable mode of worship in his own\r\ncountry, nor suffered quietly to depart from it. Yet such was the fact.\r\nHe left his country by stealth, that he might elsewhere enjoy those\r\nrights which ought to belong to men in all countries. The departure of\r\nthe Pilgrims for Holland is deeply interesting, from its circumstances,\r\nand also as it marks the character of the times, independently of its\r\nconnection with names now incorporated with the history of empire. The\r\nembarkation was intended to be made in such a manner, that it might\r\nescape the notice of the officers of government. Great pains had been\r\ntaken to secure boats, which should come undiscovered to the shore, and\r\nreceive the fugitives; and frequent disappointments had been experienced\r\nin this respect.\r\n\r\nAt length the appointed time came, bringing with it unusual severity of\r\ncold and rain. An unfrequented and barren heath, on the shores of\r\nLincolnshire, was the selected spot, where the feet of the Pilgrims were\r\nto tread, for the last time, the land of their fathers. The vessel which\r\nwas to receive them did not come until the next day, and in the mean\r\ntime the little band was collected, and men and women and children and\r\nbaggage were crowded together, in melancholy and distressed confusion.\r\nThe sea was rough, and the women and children were already sick, from\r\ntheir passage down the river to the place of embarkation on the sea. At\r\nlength the wished-for boat silently and fearfully approaches the shore,\r\nand men and women and children, shaking with fear and with cold, as many\r\nas the small vessel could bear, venture off on a dangerous sea.\r\nImmediately the advance of horses is heard from behind, armed men\r\nappear, and those not yet embarked are seized, and taken into custody.\r\nIn the hurry of the moment, the first parties had been sent on board\r\nwithout any attempt to keep members of the same family together, and on\r\naccount of the appearance of the horsemen, the boat never returned for\r\nthe residue. Those who had got away, and those who had not, were in\r\nequal distress. A storm, of great violence, and long duration, arose at\r\nsea, which not only protracted the voyage, rendered distressing by the\r\nwant of all those accommodations which the interruption of the\r\nembarkation had occasioned, but also forced the vessel out of her\r\ncourse, and menaced immediate shipwreck; while those on shore, when they\r\nwere dismissed from the custody of the officers of justice, having no\r\nlonger homes or houses to retire to, and their friends and protectors\r\nbeing already gone, became objects of necessary charity, as well as of\r\ndeep commiseration.\r\n\r\nAs this scene passes before us, we can hardly forbear asking, whether\r\nthis be a band of malefactors and felons flying from justice. What are\r\ntheir crimes, that they hide themselves in darkness? To what punishment\r\nare they exposed, that, to avoid it, men, and women, and children, thus\r\nencounter the surf of the North Sea, and the terrors of a night storm?\r\nWhat induces this armed pursuit, and this arrest of fugitives, of all\r\nages and both sexes? Truth does not allow us to answer these inquiries\r\nin a manner that does credit to the wisdom or the justice of the times.\r\nThis was not the flight of guilt, but of virtue. It was an humble and\r\npeaceable religion, flying from causeless oppression. It was conscience,\r\nattempting to escape from the arbitrary rule of the Stuarts. It was\r\nRobinson and Brewster, leading off their little band from their native\r\nsoil, at first to find shelter on the shore of the neighboring\r\ncontinent, but ultimately to come hither; and having surmounted all\r\ndifficulties and braved a thousand dangers, to find here a place of\r\nrefuge and of rest. Thanks be to God, that this spot was honored as the\r\nasylum of religious liberty! May its standard, reared here, remain for\r\never! May it rise up as high as heaven, till its banner shall fan the\r\nair of both continents, and wave as a glorious ensign of peace and\r\nsecurity to the nations!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe peculiar character, condition, and circumstances of the colonies\r\nwhich introduced civilization and an English race into New England,\r\nafford a most interesting and extensive topic of discussion. On these,\r\nmuch of our subsequent character and fortune has depended. Their\r\ninfluence has essentially affected our whole history, through the two\r\ncenturies which have elapsed; and as they have become intimately\r\nconnected with government, laws, and property, as well as with our\r\nopinions on the subjects of religion and civil liberty, that influence\r\nis likely to continue to be felt through the centuries which shall\r\nsucceed. Emigration from one region to another, and the emission of\r\ncolonies to people countries more or less distant from the residence of\r\nthe parent stock, are common incidents in the history of mankind; but it\r\nhas not often, perhaps never, happened, that the establishment of\r\ncolonies should be attempted under circumstances, however beset with\r\npresent difficulties and dangers, yet so favorable to ultimate success,\r\nand so conducive to magnificent results, as those which attended the\r\nfirst settlements on this part of the American continent. In other\r\ninstances, emigration has proceeded from a less exalted purpose, in\r\nperiods of less general intelligence, or more without plan and by\r\naccident; or under circumstances, physical and moral, less favorable to\r\nthe expectation of laying a foundation for great public prosperity and\r\nfuture empire.\r\n\r\nA great resemblance exists, obviously, between all the English colonies\r\nestablished within the present limits of the United States; but the\r\noccasion attracts our attention more immediately to those which took\r\npossession of New England, and the peculiarities of these furnish a\r\nstrong contrast with most other instances of colonization.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient nations, the Greeks, no doubt, sent forth from their\r\nterritories the greatest number of colonies. So numerous, indeed, were\r\nthey, and so great the extent of space over which they were spread, that\r\nthe parent country fondly and naturally persuaded herself, that by means\r\nof them she had laid a sure foundation for the universal civilization of\r\nthe world. These establishments, from obvious causes, were most numerous\r\nin places most contiguous; yet they were found on the coasts of France,\r\non the shores of the Euxine Sea, in Africa, and even, as is alleged, on\r\nthe borders of India. These emigrations appear to have been sometimes\r\nvoluntary and sometimes compulsory; arising from the spontaneous\r\nenterprise of individuals, or the order and regulation of government. It\r\nwas a common opinion with ancient writers, that they were undertaken in\r\nreligious obedience to the commands of oracles, and it is probable that\r\nimpressions of this sort might have had more or less influence; but it\r\nis probable, also, that on these occasions the oracles did not speak a\r\nlanguage dissonant from the views and purposes of the state.\r\n\r\nPolitical science among the Greeks seems never to have extended to the\r\ncomprehension of a system, which should be adequate to the government of\r\na great nation upon principles of liberty. They were accustomed only to\r\nthe contemplation of small republics, and were led to consider an\r\naugmented population as incompatible with free institutions. The desire\r\nof a remedy for this supposed evil, and the wish to establish marts for\r\ntrade, led the governments often to undertake the establishment of\r\ncolonies as an affair of state expediency. Colonization and commerce,\r\nindeed, would naturally become objects of interest to an ingenious and\r\nenterprising people, inhabiting a territory closely circumscribed in its\r\nlimits, and in no small part mountainous and sterile; while the islands\r\nof the adjacent seas, and the promontories and coasts of the neighboring\r\ncontinents, by their mere proximity, strongly solicited the excited\r\nspirit of emigration. Such was this proximity, in many instances, that\r\nthe new settlements appeared rather to be the mere extension of\r\npopulation over contiguous territory, than the establishment of distant\r\ncolonies. In proportion as they were near to the parent state, they\r\nwould be under its authority, and partake of its fortunes. The colony at\r\nMarseilles might perceive lightly, or not at all, the sway of Phocis;\r\nwhile the islands in the AEgean Sea could hardly attain to independence\r\nof their Athenian origin. Many of these establishments took place at an\r\nearly age; and if there were defects in the governments of the parent\r\nstates, the colonists did not possess philosophy or experience\r\nsufficient to correct such evils in their own institutions, even if they\r\nhad not been, by other causes, deprived of the power. An immediate\r\nnecessity, connected with the support of life, was the main and direct\r\ninducement to these undertakings, and there could hardly exist more than\r\nthe hope of a successful imitation of institutions with which they were\r\nalready acquainted, and of holding an equality with their neighbors in\r\nthe course of improvement. The laws and customs, both political and\r\nmunicipal, as well as the religious worship of the parent city, were\r\ntransferred to the colony; and the parent city herself, with all such of\r\nher colonies as were not too far remote for frequent intercourse and\r\ncommon sentiments, would appear like a family of cities, more or less\r\ndependent, and more or less connected. We know how imperfect this system\r\nwas, as a system of general politics, and what scope it gave to those\r\nmutual dissensions and conflicts which proved so fatal to Greece.\r\n\r\nBut it is more pertinent to our present purpose to observe, that nothing\r\nexisted in the character of Grecian emigrations, or in the spirit and\r\nintelligence of the emigrants, likely to give a new and important\r\ndirection to human affairs, or a new impulse to the human mind. Their\r\nmotives were not high enough, their views were not sufficiently large\r\nand prospective. They went not forth, like our ancestors, to erect\r\nsystems of more perfect civil liberty, or to enjoy a higher degree of\r\nreligious freedom. Above all, there was nothing in the religion and\r\nlearning of the age, that could either inspire high purposes, or give\r\nthe ability to execute them. Whatever restraints on civil liberty, or\r\nwhatever abuses in religious worship, existed at the time of our\r\nfathers' emigration, yet even then all was light in the moral and mental\r\nworld, in comparison with its condition in most periods of the ancient\r\nstates. The settlement of a new continent, in an age of progressive\r\nknowledge and improvement, could not but do more than merely enlarge the\r\nnatural boundaries of the habitable world. It could not but do much more\r\neven than extend commerce and increase wealth among the human race. We\r\nsee how this event has acted, how it must have acted, and wonder only\r\nwhy it did not act sooner, in the production of moral effects, on the\r\nstate of human knowledge, the general tone of human sentiments, and the\r\nprospects of human happiness. It gave to civilized man not only a new\r\ncontinent to be inhabited and cultivated, and new seas to be explored;\r\nbut it gave him also a new range for his thoughts, new objects for\r\ncuriosity, and new excitements to knowledge and improvement.\r\n\r\nRoman colonization resembled, far less than that of the Greeks, the\r\noriginal settlements of this country. Power and dominion were the\r\nobjects of Rome, even in her colonial establishments. Her whole exterior\r\naspect was for centuries hostile and terrific She grasped at dominion,\r\nfrom India to Britain, and her measures of colonization partook of the\r\ncharacter of her general system. Her policy was military, because\r\nher objects were power, ascendency, and subjugation. Detachments of\r\nemigrants from Rome incorporated themselves with, and governed, the\r\noriginal inhabitants of conquered countries. She sent citizens where\r\nshe had first sent soldiers; her law followed her sword. Her colonies\r\nwere a sort of military establishment; so many advanced posts in the\r\ncareer of her dominion. A governor from Rome ruled the new colony with\r\nabsolute sway, and often with unbounded rapacity. In Sicily, in Gaul,\r\nin Spain, and in Asia, the power of Rome prevailed, not nominally\r\nonly, but really and effectually. Those who immediately exercised it\r\nwere Roman; the tone and tendency of its administration, Roman. Rome\r\nherself continued to be the heart and centre of the great system which\r\nshe had established. Extortion and rapacity, finding a wide and often\r\nrich field of action in the provinces, looked nevertheless to the\r\nbanks of the Tiber, as the scene in which their ill-gotten treasures\r\nshould be displayed; or, if a spirit of more honest acquisition\r\nprevailed, the object, nevertheless, was ultimate enjoyment in Rome\r\nitself. If our own history and our own times did not sufficiently\r\nexpose the inherent and incurable evils of provincial government, we\r\nmight see them portrayed, to our amazement, in the desolated and\r\nruined provinces of the Roman empire. We might hear them, in a voice\r\nthat terrifies us, in those strains of complaint and accusation,\r\nwhich the advocates of the provinces poured forth in the Roman\r\nForum:--\"Quas res luxuries in flagitiis, crudelitas in suppliciis,\r\navaritia in rapinis, superbia in contumeliis, efficere potuisset, eas\r\nomnes sese pertulisse.\"\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected, the Roman Provinces partook of the fortunes,\r\nas well as of the sentiments and general character, of the seat of\r\nempire. They lived together with her, they flourished with her, and fell\r\nwith her. The branches were lopped away even before the vast and\r\nvenerable trunk itself fell prostrate to the earth. Nothing had\r\nproceeded from her which could support itself; and bear up the name\r\nof its origin, when her own sustaining arm should be enfeebled or\r\nwithdrawn. It was not given to Rome to see, either at her zenith or\r\nin her decline, a child of her own, distant, indeed, and independent of\r\nher control, yet speaking her language and inheriting her blood,\r\nspringing forward to a competition with her own power, and a comparison\r\nwith her own great renown. She saw not a vast region of the earth\r\npeopled from her stock, full of states and political communities,\r\nimproving upon the models of her institutions, and breathing in fuller\r\nmeasure the spirit which she had breathed in the best periods of her\r\nexistence; enjoying and extending her arts and her literature;\r\nrising rapidly from political childhood to manly strength and\r\nindependence; her offspring, yet now her equal; unconnected with the\r\ncauses which might affect the duration of her own power and greatness;\r\nof common origin, but not linked to a common fate; giving ample\r\npledge, that her name should not be forgotten, that her language\r\nshould not cease to be used among men; that whatsoever she had done\r\nfor human knowledge and human happiness should be treasured up and\r\npreserved; that the record of her existence and her achievements\r\nshould not be obscured, although, in the inscrutable purposes of\r\nProvidence, it might be her destiny to fall from opulence and\r\nsplendor; although the time might come, when darkness should settle\r\non all her hills; when foreign or domestic violence should overturn\r\nher altars and her temples; when ignorance and despotism should fill\r\nthe places where Laws, and Arts, and Liberty had flourished; when the\r\nfeet of barbarism should trample on the tombs of her consuls, and the\r\nwalls of her senate-house and forum echo only to the voice of savage\r\ntriumph. She saw not this glorious vision, to inspire and fortify her\r\nagainst the possible decay or downfall of her power. Happy are they\r\nwho in our day may behold it, if they shall contemplate it with the\r\nsentiments which it ought to inspire!\r\n\r\nThe New England Colonies differ quite as widely from the Asiatic\r\nestablishments of the modern European nations, as from the models of the\r\nancient states. The sole object of those establishments was originally\r\ntrade; although we have seen, in one of them, the anomaly of a mere\r\ntrading company attaining a political character, disbursing revenues,\r\nand maintaining armies and fortresses, until it has extended its control\r\nover seventy millions of people. Differing from these, and still more\r\nfrom the New England and North American Colonies, are the European\r\nsettlements in the West India Islands. It is not strange, that, when\r\nmen's minds were turned to the settlement of America, different objects\r\nshould be proposed by those who emigrated to the different regions of so\r\nvast a country. Climate, soil, and condition were not all equally\r\nfavorable to all pursuits. In the West Indies, the purpose of those who\r\nwent thither was to engage in that species of agriculture, suited to the\r\nsoil and climate, which seems to bear more resemblance to commerce, than\r\nto the hard and plain tillage of New England. The great staples of these\r\ncountries, being partly an agricultural and partly a manufactured\r\nproduct, and not being of the necessaries of life, become the object of\r\ncalculation, with respect to a profitable investment of capital, like\r\nany other enterprise of trade or manufacture. The more especially, as,\r\nrequiring, by necessity or habit, slave labor for their production, the\r\ncapital necessary to carry on the work of this production is very\r\nconsiderable. The West Indies are resorted to, therefore, rather for the\r\ninvestment of capital, than for the purpose of sustaining life by\r\npersonal labor. Such as possess a considerable amount of capital, or\r\nsuch as choose to adventure in commercial speculations without capital,\r\ncan alone be fitted to be emigrants to the islands. The agriculture of\r\nthese regions, as before observed, is a sort of commerce; and it is a\r\nspecies of employment in which labor seems to form as inconsiderable\r\ningredient in the productive causes, since the portion of white labor is\r\nexceedingly small, and slave labor is rather more like profit on stock\r\nor capital, than _labor_ properly so called. The individual who\r\nundertakes an establishment of this kind takes into the account the cost\r\nof the necessary number of slaves, in the same manner as he calculates\r\nthe cost of the land. The uncertainty, too, of this species of\r\nemployment, affords another ground of resemblance to commerce. Although\r\ngainful on the whole, and in a series of years, it is often very\r\ndisastrous for a single year, and, as the capital is not readily\r\ninvested in other pursuits, bad crops or bad markets not only affect the\r\nprofits, but the capital itself. Hence the sudden depressions which take\r\nplace in the value of such estates.\r\n\r\nBut the great and leading observation, relative to these establishments,\r\nremains to be made. It is, that the owners of the soil and of the\r\ncapital seldom consider themselves _at home_ in the colony. A very great\r\nportion of the soil itself is usually owned in the mother country; a\r\nstill greater is mortgaged for capital obtained there; and, in general,\r\nthose who are to derive an interest from the products look to the parent\r\ncountry as the place for enjoyment of their wealth. The population is\r\ntherefore constantly fluctuating. Nobody comes but to return. A constant\r\nsuccession of owners, agents, and factors takes place. Whatsoever the\r\nsoil, forced by the unmitigated toil of slavery, can yield, is sent home\r\nto defray rents, and interest, and agencies, or to give the means of\r\nliving in a better society. In such a state, it is evident that no\r\nspirit of permanent improvement is likely to spring up. Profits will not\r\nbe invested with a distant view of benefiting posterity. Roads and\r\ncanals will hardly be built; schools will not be founded; colleges will\r\nnot be endowed. There will be few fixtures in society; no principles of\r\nutility or of elegance, planted now, with the hope of being developed\r\nand expanded hereafter. Profit, immediate profit, must be the principal\r\nactive spring in the social system. There may be many particular\r\nexceptions to these general remarks, but the outline of the whole is\r\nsuch as is here drawn.\r\n\r\nAnother most important consequence of such a state of things is, that no\r\nidea of independence of the parent country is likely to arise; unless,\r\nindeed, it should spring up in a form that would threaten universal\r\ndesolation. The inhabitants have no strong attachment to the place which\r\nthey inhabit. The hope of a great portion of them is to leave it; and\r\ntheir great desire, to leave it soon. However useful they may be to the\r\nparent state, how much soever they may add to the conveniences and\r\nluxuries of life, these colonies are not favored spots for the expansion\r\nof the human mind, for the progress of permanent improvement, or for\r\nsowing the seeds of future independent empire.\r\n\r\nDifferent, indeed, most widely different, from all these instances of\r\nemigration and plantation, were the condition, the purposes, and the\r\nprospects of our fathers, when they established their infant colony upon\r\nthis spot. They came hither to a land from which they were never to\r\nreturn. Hither they had brought, and here they were to fix, their hopes,\r\ntheir attachments, and their objects in life. Some natural tears they\r\nshed, as they left the pleasant abodes of their fathers, and some\r\nemotions they suppressed, when the white cliffs of their native country,\r\nnow seen for the last time, grew dim to their sight. They were acting,\r\nhowever, upon a resolution not to be daunted. With whatever stifled\r\nregrets, with whatever occasional hesitation, with whatever appalling\r\napprehensions, which might sometimes arise with force to shake the\r\nfirmest purpose, they had yet committed themselves to Heaven and the\r\nelements; and a thousand leagues of water soon interposed to separate\r\nthem for ever from the region which gave them birth. A new existence\r\nawaited them here; and when they saw these shores, rough, cold,\r\nbarbarous, and barren, as then they were, they beheld their country.\r\nThat mixed and strong feeling, which we call love of country, and which\r\nis, in general, never extinguished in the heart of man, grasped and\r\nembraced its proper object here. Whatever constitutes _country_, except\r\nthe earth and the sun, all the moral causes of affection and attachment\r\nwhich operate upon the heart, they had brought with them to their new\r\nabode. Here were now their families and friends, their homes, and their\r\nproperty. Before they reached the shore, they had established the\r\nelements of a social system,[40] and at a much earlier period had\r\nsettled their forms of religions worship. At the moment of their\r\nlanding, therefore, they possessed institutions of government, and\r\ninstitutions of religion: and friends and families, and social and\r\nreligious institutions, framed by consent, founded on choice and\r\npreference, how nearly do these fill up our whole idea of country! The\r\nmorning that beamed on the first night of their repose saw the Pilgrims\r\nalready _at home_ in their country. There were political institutions,\r\nand civil liberty, and religious worship. Poetry has fancied nothing, in\r\nthe wanderings of heroes, so distinct and characteristic. Here was man,\r\nindeed, unprotected, and unprovided for, on the shore of a rude and\r\nfearful wilderness; but it was politic, intelligent, and educated man.\r\nEvery thing was civilized but the physical world. Institutions,\r\ncontaining in substance all that ages had done for human government,\r\nwere organized in a forest Cultivated mind was to act on uncultivated\r\nnature; and, more than all, a government and a country were to commence,\r\nwith the very first foundations laid under the divine light of the\r\nChristian religion. Happy auspices of a happy futurity! Who would wish\r\nthat his country's existence had otherwise begun? Who would desire the\r\npower of going back to the ages of fable? Who would wish for an origin\r\nobscured in the darkness of antiquity? Who would wish for other\r\nemblazoning of his country's heraldry, or other ornaments of her\r\ngenealogy, than to be able to say, that her first existence was with\r\nintelligence, her first breath the inspiration of liberty, her first\r\nprinciple the truth of divine religion?\r\n\r\nLocal attachments and sympathies would ere long spring up in the breasts\r\nof our ancestors, endearing to them the place of their refuge. Whatever\r\nnatural objects are associated with interesting scenes and high efforts\r\nobtain a hold on human feeling, and demand from the heart a sort of\r\nrecognition and regard. This Rock soon became hallowed in the esteem of\r\nthe Pilgrims,[41] and these hills grateful to their sight. Neither they\r\nnor their children were again to till the soil of England, nor again to\r\ntraverse the seas which surround her.[42] But here was a new sea, now\r\nopen to their enterprise, and a new soil, which had not failed to\r\nrespond gratefully to their laborious industry, and which was already\r\nassuming a robe of verdure. Hardly had they provided shelter for the\r\nliving, ere they were summoned to erect sepulchres for the dead. The\r\nground had become sacred, by inclosing the remains of some of their\r\ncompanions and connections. A parent, a child, a husband, or a wife, had\r\ngone the way of all flesh, and mingled with the dust of New England. We\r\nnaturally look with strong emotions to the spot, though it be a\r\nwilderness, where the ashes of those we have loved repose. Where the\r\nheart has laid down what it loved most, there it is desirous of laying\r\nitself down. No sculptured marble, no enduring monument, no honorable\r\ninscription, no ever-burning taper that would drive away the darkness of\r\nthe tomb, can soften our sense of the reality of death, and hallow to\r\nour feelings the ground which is to cover us, like the consciousness\r\nthat we shall sleep, dust to dust, with the objects of our affections.\r\n\r\nIn a short time other causes sprung up to bind the Pilgrims with new\r\ncords to their chosen land. Children were born, and the hopes of future\r\ngenerations arose, in the spot of their new habitation. The second\r\ngeneration found this the land of their nativity, and saw that they were\r\nbound to its fortunes. They beheld their fathers' graves around them,\r\nand while they read the memorials of their toils and labors, they\r\nrejoiced in the inheritance which they found bequeathed to them.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of these causes, it was to be expected, that an\r\ninterest and a feeling should arise here, entirely different from the\r\ninterest and feeling of mere Englishmen; and all the subsequent history\r\nof the Colonies proves this to have actually and gradually taken place.\r\nWith a general acknowledgment of the supremacy of the British crown,\r\nthere was, from the first a repugnance to an entire submission to the\r\ncontrol of British legislation. The Colonies stood upon their charters,\r\nwhich, as they contended, exempted them from the ordinary power of the\r\nBritish Parliament, and authorized them to conduct their own concerns by\r\ntheir own counsels. They utterly resisted the notion that they were to\r\nbe ruled by the mere authority of the government at home, and would not\r\nendure even that their own charter governments should be established on\r\nthe other side of the Atlantic. It was not a controlling or protecting\r\nboard in England, but a government of their own, and existing\r\nimmediately within their limits, which could satisfy their wishes. It\r\nwas easy to foresee, what we know also to have happened, that the first\r\ngreat cause of collision and jealousy would be, under the notion of\r\npolitical economy then and still prevalent in Europe, an attempt on the\r\npart of the mother country to monopolize the trade of the Colonies.\r\nWhoever has looked deeply into the causes which produced our Revolution\r\nhas found, if I mistake not, the original principle far back in this\r\nclaim, on the part of England, to monopolize our trade, and a continued\r\neffort on the part of the Colonies to resist or evade that monopoly; if,\r\nindeed, it be not still more just and philosophical to go farther back,\r\nand to consider it decided, that an independent government must arise\r\nhere, the moment it was ascertained that an English colony, such as\r\nlanded in this place, could sustain itself against the dangers which\r\nsurrounded it, and, with other similar establishments, overspread the\r\nland with an English population. Accidental causes retarded at times,\r\nand at times accelerated, the progress of the controversy. The Colonies\r\nwanted strength, and time gave it to them. They required measures of\r\nstrong and palpable injustice, on the part of the mother country, to\r\njustify resistance; the early part of the late king's reign furnished\r\nthem. They needed spirits of high order, of great daring, of long\r\nforesight, and of commanding power, to seize the favoring occasion to\r\nstrike a blow, which should sever, for all time, the tic of colonial\r\ndependence; and these spirits were found, in all the extent which that\r\nor any crisis could demand, in Otis, Adams, Hancock, and the other\r\nimmediate authors of our independence.\r\n\r\nStill, it is true that, for a century, causes had been in operation\r\ntending to prepare things for this great result. In the year 1660 the\r\nEnglish Act of Navigation was passed; the first and grand object of\r\nwhich seems to have been, to secure to England the whole trade with her\r\nplantations.[43] It was provided by that act, that none but English\r\nships should transport American produce over the ocean, and that the\r\nprincipal articles of that produce should be allowed to be sold only in\r\nthe markets of the mother country. Three years afterwards another law\r\nwas passed, which enacted, that such commodities as the Colonies might\r\nwish to purchase should be bought only in the markets of the mother\r\ncountry. Severe rules were prescribed to enforce the provisions of these\r\nlaws, and heavy penalties imposed on all who should violate them. In the\r\nsubsequent years of the same reign, other statutes were enacted to\r\nreenforce these statutes, and other rules prescribed to secure a\r\ncompliance with these rules. In this manner was the trade to and from\r\nthe Colonies restricted, almost to the exclusive advantage of the parent\r\ncountry. But laws, which rendered the interest of a whole people\r\nsubordinate to that of another people, were not likely to execute\r\nthemselves; nor was it easy to find many on the spot, who could be\r\ndepended upon for carrying them into execution. In fact, these laws were\r\nmore or less evaded or resisted, in all the Colonies. To enforce them\r\nwas the constant endeavor of the government at home; to prevent or elude\r\ntheir operation, the perpetual object here. \"The laws of navigation,\"\r\nsays a living British writer, \"were nowhere so openly disobeyed and\r\ncontemned as in New England.\" \"The people of Massachusetts Bay,\" he\r\nadds, \"were from the first disposed to act as if independent of the\r\nmother country, and having a governor and magistrates of their own\r\nchoice, it was difficult to enforce any regulation which came from the\r\nEnglish Parliament, adverse to their interests.\" To provide more\r\neffectually for the execution of these laws, we know that courts of\r\nadmiralty were afterwards established by the crown, with power to try\r\nrevenue causes, as questions of admiralty, upon the construction given\r\nby the crown lawyers to an act of Parliament; a great departure from the\r\nordinary principles of English jurisprudence, but which has been\r\nmaintained, nevertheless, by the force of habit and precedent, and is\r\nadopted in our own existing systems of government.\r\n\r\n\"There lie,\" says another English writer, whose connection with the\r\nBoard of Trade has enabled him to ascertain many facts connected with\r\nColonial history, \"There lie among the documents in the board of trade\r\nand state-paper office, the most satisfactory proofs, from the epoch of\r\nthe English Revolution in 1688, throughout every reign, and during every\r\nadministration, of the settled purpose of the Colonies to acquire direct\r\nindependence and positive sovereignty.\" Perhaps this may be stated\r\nsomewhat too strongly; but it cannot be denied, that, from the very\r\nnature of the establishments here, and from the general character of the\r\nmeasures respecting their concerns early adopted and steadily pursued by\r\nthe English government, a division of the empire was the natural and\r\nnecessary result to which every thing tended.[44]\r\n\r\nI have dwelt on this topic, because it seems to me, that the peculiar\r\noriginal character of the New England Colonies, and certain causes\r\ncoeval with their existence, have had a strong and decided influence on\r\nall their subsequent history, and especially on the great event of the\r\nRevolution. Whoever would write our history, and would understand and\r\nexplain early transactions, should comprehend the nature and force of\r\nthe feeling which I have endeavored to describe. As a son, leaving the\r\nhouse of his father for his own, finds, by the order of nature, and the\r\nvery law of his being, nearer and dearer objects around which his\r\naffections circle, while his attachment to the parental roof becomes\r\nmoderated, by degrees, to a composed regard and an affectionate\r\nremembrance; so our ancestors, leaving their native land, not without\r\nsome violence to the feelings of nature and affection, yet, in time,\r\nfound here a new circle of engagements, interests, and affections; a\r\nfeeling, which more and more encroached upon the old, till an undivided\r\nsentiment, _that this was their country_, occupied the heart; and\r\npatriotism, shutting out from its embraces the parent realm, became\r\n_local_ to America.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome retrospect of the century which has now elapsed is among the\r\nduties of the occasion. It must, however, necessarily be imperfect, to\r\nbe compressed within the limits of a single discourse. I shall content\r\nmyself; therefore, with taking notice of a few of the leading and most\r\nimportant occurrences which have distinguished the period.\r\n\r\nWhen the first century closed, the progress of the country appeared to\r\nhave been considerable; notwithstanding that, in comparison with its\r\nsubsequent advancement, it now seems otherwise. A broad and lasting\r\nfoundation had been laid; excellent institutions had been established;\r\nmany of the prejudices of former times had been removed; a more liberal\r\nand catholic spirit on subjects of religious concern had begun to extend\r\nitself; and many things conspired to give promise of increasing future\r\nprosperity. Great men had arisen in public life, and the liberal\r\nprofessions. The Mathers, father and son, were then sinking low in the\r\nwestern horizon; Leverett, the learned, the accomplished, the excellent\r\nLeverett, was about to withdraw his brilliant and useful light. In\r\nPemberton great hopes had been suddenly extinguished, but Prince and\r\nColman were in our sky; and along the east had began to flash the\r\ncrepuscular light of a great luminary which was about to appear, and\r\nwhich was to stamp the age with his own name, as the age of Franklin.\r\n\r\nThe bloody Indian wars, which harassed the people for a part of the\r\nfirst century; the restrictions on the trade of the Colonies, added to\r\nthe discouragements inherently belonging to all forms of colonial\r\ngovernment; the distance from Europe, and the small hope of immediate\r\nprofit to adventurers, are among the causes which had contributed to\r\nretard the progress of population. Perhaps it may be added, also, that\r\nduring the period of the civil wars in England, and the reign of\r\nCromwell, many persons, whose religious opinions and religious temper\r\nmight, under other circumstances, have induced them to join the New\r\nEngland colonists, found reasons to remain in England; either on account\r\nof active occupation in the scenes which were passing, or of an\r\nanticipation of the enjoyment, in their own country, of a form of\r\ngovernment, civil and religious, accommodated to their views and\r\nprinciples. The violent measures, too, pursued against the Colonies in\r\nthe reign of Charles the Second, the mockery of a trial, and the\r\nforfeiture of the charters, were serious evils. And during the open\r\nviolences of the short reign of James the Second, and the tyranny of\r\nAndros, as the venerable historian of Connecticut observes, \"All the\r\nmotives to great actions, to industry, economy, enterprise, wealth, and\r\npopulation, were in a manner annihilated. A general inactivity and\r\nlanguishment pervaded the public body. Liberty, property, and every\r\nthing which ought to be dear to men, every day grew more and more\r\ninsecure.\"\r\n\r\nWith the Revolution in England, a better prospect had opened on this\r\ncountry, as well as on that. The joy had been as great at that event,\r\nand far more universal, in New than in Old England. A new charter had\r\nbeen granted to Massachusetts, which, although it did not confirm to her\r\ninhabitants all their former privileges, yet relieved them from great\r\nevils and embarrassments, and promised future security. More than all,\r\nperhaps, the Revolution in England had done good to the general cause of\r\nliberty and justice. A blow had been struck in favor of the rights and\r\nliberties, not of England alone, but of descendants and kinsmen of\r\nEngland all over the world. Great political truths had been established.\r\nThe champions of liberty had been successful in a fearful and perilous\r\nconflict. Somers, and Cavendish, and Jekyl, and Howard, had triumphed in\r\none of the most noble causes ever undertaken by men. A revolution had\r\nbeen made upon principle. A monarch had been dethroned for violating the\r\noriginal compact between king and people. The rights of the people to\r\npartake in the government, and to limit the monarch by fundamental rules\r\nof government, had been maintained; and however unjust the government of\r\nEngland might afterwards be towards other governments or towards her\r\ncolonies, she had ceased to be governed herself by the arbitrary maxims\r\nof the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nNew England had submitted to the violence of James the Second not longer\r\nthan Old England. Not only was it reserved to Massachusetts, that on her\r\nsoil should be acted the first scene of that great revolutionary drama,\r\nwhich was to take place near a century afterwards, but the English\r\nRevolution itself, as far as the Colonies were concerned, commenced in\r\nBoston. The seizure and imprisonment of Andros, in April, 1689, were\r\nacts of direct and forcible resistance to the authority of James the\r\nSecond. The pulse of liberty beat as high in the extremities as at the\r\nheart. The vigorous feeling of the Colony burst out before it was known\r\nhow the parent country would finally conduct herself. The king's\r\nrepresentative, Sir Edmund Andros, was a prisoner in the castle at\r\nBoston, before it was or could be known that the king himself had ceased\r\nto exercise his full dominion on the English throne.\r\n\r\nBefore it was known here whether the invasion of the Prince of Orange\r\nwould or could prove successful, as soon as it was known that it had\r\nbeen undertaken, the people of Massachusetts, at the imminent hazard of\r\ntheir lives and fortunes, had accomplished the Revolution as far as\r\nrespected themselves. It is probable that, reasoning on general\r\nprinciples and the known attachment of the English people to their\r\nconstitution and liberties, and their deep and fixed dislike of the\r\nking's religion and politics, the people of New England expected a\r\ncatastrophe fatal to the power of the reigning prince. Yet it was\r\nneither certain enough, nor near enough, to come to their aid against\r\nthe authority of the crown, in that crisis which had arrived, and in\r\nwhich they trusted to put themselves, relying on God and their own\r\ncourage. There were spirits in Massachusetts congenial with the spirits\r\nof the distinguished friends of the Revolution in England. There were\r\nthose who were fit to associate with the boldest asserters of civil\r\nliberty; and Mather himself, then in England, was not unworthy to be\r\nranked with those sons of the Church, whose firmness and spirit in\r\nresisting kingly encroachments in matters of religion, entitled them to\r\nthe gratitude of their own and succeeding ages.\r\n\r\nThe second century opened upon New England under circumstances which\r\nevinced that much had already been accomplished, and that still better\r\nprospects and brighter hopes were before her. She had laid, deep and\r\nstrong, the foundations of her society. Her religious principles were\r\nfirm, and her moral habits exemplary. Her public schools had began to\r\ndiffuse widely the elements of knowledge; and the College, under the\r\nexcellent and acceptable administration of Leverett, had been raised to\r\na high degree of credit and usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe commercial character of the country, notwithstanding all\r\ndiscouragements, had begun to display itself, and _five hundred\r\nvessels_, then belonging to Massachusetts, placed her, in relation to\r\ncommerce, thus early at the head of the Colonies. An author who wrote\r\nvery near the close of the first century says:--\"New England is almost\r\ndeserving that _noble name_, so mightily hath it increased; and from a\r\nsmall settlement at first, is now become a _very populous_ and\r\n_flourishing_ government. The _capital city_, Boston, is a place of\r\n_great wealth and trade_; and by much the largest of any in the English\r\nempire of America; and not exceeded but by few cities, perhaps two or\r\nthree, in all the American world.\"\r\n\r\nBut if our ancestors at the close of the first century could look back\r\nwith joy, and even admiration, at the progress of the country, what\r\nemotions must we not feel, when, from the point on which we stand, we\r\nalso look back and run along the events of the century which has now\r\nclosed! The country which then, as we have seen, was thought deserving\r\nof a \"noble name,\"--which then had \"mightily increased,\" and become\r\n\"very populous,\"--what was it, in comparison with what our eyes behold\r\nit? At that period, a very great proportion of its inhabitants lived in\r\nthe eastern section of Massachusetts proper, and in Plymouth Colony. In\r\nConnecticut, there were towns along the coast, some of them respectable,\r\nbut in the interior all was a wilderness beyond Hartford. On Connecticut\r\nRiver, settlements had proceeded as far up as Deerfield, and Fort Dummer\r\nhad been built near where is now the south line of New Hampshire. In New\r\nHampshire no settlement was then begun thirty miles from the mouth of\r\nPiscataqua River, and in what is now Maine, the inhabitants were\r\nconfined to the coast. The aggregate of the whole population of New\r\nEngland did not exceed one hundred and sixty thousand. Its present\r\namount (1820) is probably one million seven hundred thousand. Instead of\r\nbeing confined to its former limits, her population has rolled backward,\r\nand filled up the spaces included within her actual local boundaries.\r\nNot this only, but it has overflowed those boundaries, and the waves of\r\nemigration have pressed farther and farther toward the West. The\r\nAlleghany has not checked it; the banks of the Ohio have been covered\r\nwith it. New England farms, houses, villages, and churches spread over\r\nand adorn the immense extent from the Ohio to Lake Erie, and stretch\r\nalong from the Alleghany onwards, beyond the Miamis, and toward the\r\nFalls of St. Anthony. Two thousand miles westward from the rock where\r\ntheir fathers landed, may now be found the sons of the Pilgrims,\r\ncultivating smiling fields, rearing towns and villages, and cherishing,\r\nwe trust, the patrimonial blessings of wise institutions, of liberty,\r\nand religion. The world has seen nothing like this. Regions large enough\r\nto be empires, and which, half a century ago, were known only as remote\r\nand unexplored wildernesses, are now teeming with population, and\r\nprosperous in all the great concerns of life; in good governments, the\r\nmeans of subsistence, and social happiness. It may be safely asserted,\r\nthat there are now more than a million of people, descendants of New\r\nEngland ancestry, living, free and happy, in regions which scarce sixty\r\nyears ago were tracts of unpenetrated forest. Nor do rivers, or\r\nmountains, or seas resist the progress of industry and enterprise. Ere\r\nlong, the sons of the Pilgrims will be on the shores of the Pacific.[45]\r\nThe imagination hardly keeps pace with the progress of population,\r\nimprovement, and civilization.\r\n\r\nIt is now five-and-forty years since the growth and rising glory of\r\nAmerica were portrayed in the English Parliament, with inimitable\r\nbeauty, by the most consummate orator of modern times. Going back\r\nsomewhat more than half a century, and describing our progress as\r\nforeseen from that point by his amiable friend Lord Bathurst, then\r\nliving, he spoke of the wonderful progress which America had made during\r\nthe period of a single human life. There is no American heart, I\r\nimagine, that does not glow, both with conscious, patriotic pride, and\r\nadmiration for one of the happiest efforts of eloquence, so often as the\r\nvision of \"that little speck, scarce visible in the mass of national\r\ninterest, a small seminal principle, rather than a formed body,\" and the\r\nprogress of its astonishing development and growth, are recalled to the\r\nrecollection. But a stronger feeling might be produced, if we were able\r\nto take up this prophetic description where he left it, and, placing\r\nourselves at the point of time in which he was speaking, to set forth\r\nwith equal felicity the subsequent progress of the country. There is yet\r\namong the living a most distinguished and venerable name, a descendant\r\nof the Pilgrims; one who has been attended through life by a great and\r\nfortunate genius; a man illustrious by his own great merits, and favored\r\nof Heaven in the long continuation of his years.[46] The time when the\r\nEnglish orator was thus speaking of America preceded but by a few days\r\nthe actual opening of the revolutionary drama at Lexington. He to whom I\r\nhave alluded, then at the age of forty, was among the most zealous and\r\nable defenders of the violated rights of his country. He seemed already\r\nto have filled a full measure of public service, and attained an\r\nhonorable fame. The moment was full of difficulty and danger, and big\r\nwith events of immeasurable importance. The country was on the very\r\nbrink of a civil war, of which no man could foretell the duration or the\r\nresult. Something more than a courageous hope, or characteristic ardor,\r\nwould have been necessary to impress the glorious prospect on his\r\nbelief, if, at that moment, before the sound of the first shock of\r\nactual war had reached his ears, some attendant spirit had opened to him\r\nthe vision of the future;--if it had said to him, \"The blow is struck,\r\nand America is severed from England for ever!\"--if it had informed him,\r\nthat he himself, during the next annual revolution of the sun, should\r\nput his own hand to the great instrument of independence, and write his\r\nname where all nations should behold it and all time should not efface\r\nit; that ere long he himself should maintain the interests and represent\r\nthe sovereignty of his new-born country in the proudest courts of\r\nEurope; that he should one day exercise her supreme magistracy; that he\r\nshould yet live to behold ten millions of fellow-citizens paying him the\r\nhomage of their deepest gratitude and kindest affections; that he should\r\nsee distinguished talent and high public trust resting where his name\r\nrested; that he should even see with his own unclouded eyes the close of\r\nthe second century of New England, who had begun life almost with its\r\ncommencement, and lived through nearly half the whole history of his\r\ncountry; and that on the morning of this auspicious day he should be\r\nfound in the political councils of his native State, revising, by the\r\nlight of experience, that system of government which forty years before\r\nhe had assisted to frame and establish; and, great and happy as he\r\nshould then behold his country, there should be nothing in prospect to\r\ncloud the scene, nothing to check the ardor of that confident and\r\npatriotic hope which should glow in his bosom to the end of his long\r\nprotracted and happy life.\r\n\r\nIt would far exceed the limits of this discourse even to mention the\r\nprincipal events in the civil and political history of New England\r\nduring the century; the more so, as for the last half of the period that\r\nhistory has, most happily, been closely interwoven with the general\r\nhistory of the United States. New England bore an honorable part in the\r\nwars which took place between England and France. The capture of\r\nLouisburg gave her a character for military achievement; and in the war\r\nwhich terminated with the peace of 1763, her exertions on the frontiers\r\nwere of most essential service, as well to the mother country as to all\r\nthe Colonies.\r\n\r\nIn New England the war of the Revolution commenced. I address those who\r\nremember the memorable 19th of April, 1775; who shortly after saw the\r\nburning spires of Charlestown; who beheld the deeds of Prescott, and\r\nheard the voice of Putnam amidst the storm of war, and saw the generous\r\nWarren fall, the first distinguished victim in the cause of liberty. It\r\nwould be superfluous to say, that no portion of the country did more\r\nthan the States of New England to bring the Revolutionary struggle to a\r\nsuccessful issue. It is scarcely less to her credit, that she saw early\r\nthe necessity of a closer union of the States, and gave an efficient and\r\nindispensable aid to the establishment and organization of the federal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we might safely say, that a new spirit and a new excitement\r\nbegan to exist here about the middle of the last century. To whatever\r\ncauses it may be imputed, there seems then to have commenced a more\r\nrapid improvement. The Colonies had attracted more of the attention of\r\nthe mother country, and some renown in arms had been acquired. Lord\r\nChatham was the first English minister who attached high importance to\r\nthese possessions of the crown, and who foresaw any thing of their\r\nfuture growth and extension. His opinion was, that the great rival of\r\nEngland was chiefly to be feared as a maritime and commercial power, and\r\nto drive her out of North America and deprive her of her West Indian\r\npossessions was a leading object in his policy. He dwelt often on the\r\nfisheries, as nurseries for British seamen, and the colonial trade, as\r\nfurnishing them employment. The war, conducted by him with so much\r\nvigor, terminated in a peace, by which Canada was ceded to England. The\r\neffect of this was immediately visible in the New England Colonies; for,\r\nthe fear of Indian hostilities on the frontiers being now happily\r\nremoved, settlements went on with an activity before that time\r\naltogether unprecedented, and public affairs wore a new and encouraging\r\naspect. Shortly after this fortunate termination of the French war, the\r\ninteresting topics connected with the taxation of America by the British\r\nParliament began to be discussed, and the attention and all the\r\nfaculties of the people drawn towards them. There is perhaps no portion\r\nof our history more full of interest than the period from 1760 to the\r\nactual commencement of the war. The progress of opinion in this period,\r\nthough less known, is not less important than the progress of arms\r\nafterwards. Nothing deserves more consideration than those events and\r\ndiscussions which affected the public sentiment and settled the\r\nrevolution in men's minds, before hostilities openly broke out.\r\n\r\nInternal improvement followed the establishment and prosperous\r\ncommencement of the present government. More has been done for roads,\r\ncanals, and other public works, within the last thirty years, than in\r\nall our former history. In the first of these particulars, few countries\r\nexcel the New England States. The astonishing increase of their\r\nnavigation and trade is known to every one, and now belongs to the\r\nhistory of our national wealth.\r\n\r\nWe may flatter ourselves, too, that literature and taste have not been\r\nstationary, and that some advancement has been made in the elegant, as\r\nwell as in the useful arts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe nature and constitution of society and government in this country\r\nare interesting topics, to which I would devote what remains of the\r\ntime allowed to this occasion. Of our system of government the first\r\nthing to be said is, that it is really and practically a free system.\r\nIt originates entirely with the people, and rests on no other foundation\r\nthan their assent. To judge of its actual operation, it is not enough\r\nto look merely at the form of its construction. The practical character\r\nof government depends often on a variety of considerations, besides the\r\nabstract frame of its constitutional organization. Among these are the\r\ncondition and tenure of property; the laws regulating its alienation\r\nand descent; the presence or absence of a military power; an armed\r\nor unarmed yeomanry; the spirit of the age, and the degree of\r\ngeneral intelligence. In these respects it cannot be denied that the\r\ncircumstances of this country are most favorable to the hope of\r\nmaintaining the government of a great nation on principles entirely\r\npopular. In the absence of military power, the nature of government\r\nmust essentially depend on the manner in which property is holden and\r\ndistributed. There is a natural influence belonging to property, whether\r\nit exists in many hands or few; and it is on the rights of property that\r\nboth despotism and unrestrained popular violence ordinarily commence\r\ntheir attacks. Our ancestors began their system of government here\r\nunder a condition of comparative equality in regard to wealth, and\r\ntheir early laws were of a nature to favor and continue this equality.\r\n\r\nA republican form of government rests not more on political\r\nconstitutions, than on those laws which regulate the descent and\r\ntransmission of property. Governments like ours could not have been\r\nmaintained, where property was holden according to the principles of the\r\nfeudal system; nor, on the other hand, could the feudal constitution\r\npossibly exist with us. Our New England ancestors brought hither no\r\ngreat capitals from Europe; and if they had, there was nothing\r\nproductive in which they could have been invested. They left behind them\r\nthe whole feudal policy of the other continent. They broke away at once\r\nfrom the system of military service established in the Dark Ages, and\r\nwhich continues, down even to the present time, more or less to affect\r\nthe condition of property all over Europe. They came to a new country.\r\nThere were, as yet, no lands yielding rent, and no tenants rendering\r\nservice. The whole soil was unreclaimed from barbarism. They were\r\nthemselves, either from their original condition, or from the necessity\r\nof their common interest, nearly on a general level in respect to\r\nproperty. Their situation demanded a parcelling out and division of the\r\nlands, and it may be fairly said, that this necessary act _fixed the\r\nfuture frame and form of their government_. The character of their\r\npolitical institutions was determined by the fundamental laws respecting\r\nproperty. The laws rendered estates divisible among sons and daughters.\r\nThe right of primogeniture, at first limited and curtailed, was\r\nafterwards abolished. The property was all freehold. The entailment of\r\nestates, long trusts, and the other processes for fettering and tying up\r\ninheritances, were not applicable to the condition of society, and\r\nseldom made use of. On the contrary, alienation of the land was every\r\nway facilitated, even to the subjecting of it to every species of debt.\r\nThe establishment of public registries, and the simplicity of our forms\r\nof conveyance, have greatly facilitated the change of real estate from\r\none proprietor to another. The consequence of all these causes has been,\r\na great subdivision of the soil, and a great equality of condition; the\r\ntrue basis, most certainly, of a popular government. \"If the people,\"\r\nsays Harrington, \"hold three parts in four of the territory, it is plain\r\nthere can neither be any single person nor nobility able to dispute the\r\ngovernment with them; in this case, therefore, _except force be\r\ninterposed_, they govern themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of other nations may teach us how favorable to public\r\nliberty are the division of the soil into small freeholds, and a system\r\nof laws, of which the tendency is, without violence or injustice, to\r\nproduce and to preserve a degree of equality of property. It has been\r\nestimated, if I mistake not, that about the time of Henry the Seventh\r\nfour fifths of the land in England was holden by the great barons and\r\necclesiastics. The effects of a growing commerce soon afterwards began\r\nto break in on this state of things, and before the Revolution, in 1688,\r\na vast change had been wrought. It may be thought probable, that, for\r\nthe last half-century, the process of subdivision in England has been\r\nretarded, if not reversed; that the great weight of taxation has\r\ncompelled many of the lesser freeholders to dispose of their estates,\r\nand to seek employment in the army and navy, in the professions of civil\r\nlife, in commerce, or in the colonies. The effect of this on the British\r\nconstitution cannot but be most unfavorable. A few large estates grow\r\nlarger; but the number of those who have no estates also increases; and\r\nthere may be danger, lest the inequality of property become so great,\r\nthat those who possess it may be dispossessed by force; in other words,\r\nthat the government may be overturned.\r\n\r\nA most interesting experiment of the effect of a subdivision of property\r\non government is now making in France. It is understood, that the law\r\nregulating the transmission of property in that country, now divides it,\r\nreal and personal, among all the children equally, both sons and\r\ndaughters; and that there is, also, a very great restraint on the power\r\nof making dispositions of property by will. It has been supposed, that\r\nthe effects of this might probably be, in time, to break up the soil\r\ninto such small subdivisions, that the proprietors would be too poor to\r\nresist the encroachments of executive power. I think far otherwise. What\r\nis lost in individual wealth will be more than gained in numbers, in\r\nintelligence, and in a sympathy of sentiment. If, indeed, only one or a\r\nfew landholders were to resist the crown, like the barons of England,\r\nthey must, of course, be great and powerful landholders, with multitudes\r\nof retainers, to promise success. But if the proprietors of a given\r\nextent of territory are summoned to resistance, there is no reason to\r\nbelieve that such resistance would be less forcible, or less successful,\r\nbecause the number of such proprietors happened to be great. Each would\r\nperceive his own importance, and his own interest, and would feel that\r\nnatural elevation of character which the consciousness of property\r\ninspires. A common sentiment would unite all, and numbers would not only\r\nadd strength, but excite enthusiasm. It is true, that France possesses a\r\nvast military force, under the direction of an hereditary executive\r\ngovernment; and military power, it is possible, may overthrow any\r\ngovernment. It is in vain, however, in this period of the world, to look\r\nfor security against military power to the arm of the great landholders.\r\nThat notion is derived from a state of things long since past; a state\r\nin which a feudal baron, with his retainers, might stand against the\r\nsovereign and his retainers, himself but the greatest baron. But at\r\npresent, what could the richest landholder do, against one regiment of\r\ndisciplined troops? Other securities, therefore, against the prevalence\r\nof military power must be provided. Happily for us, we are not so\r\nsituated as that any purpose of national defence requires, ordinarily\r\nand constantly, such a military force as might seriously endanger our\r\nliberties.\r\n\r\nIn respect, however, to the recent law of succession in France, to which\r\nI have alluded, I would, presumptously perhaps, hazard a conjecture,\r\nthat, if the government do not change the law, the law in half a century\r\nwill change the government; and that this change will be, not in favor\r\nof the power of the crown, as some European writers have supposed, but\r\nagainst it. Those writers only reason upon what they think correct\r\ngeneral principles, in relation to this subject. They acknowledge a want\r\nof experience. Here we have had that experience; and we know that a\r\nmultitude of small proprietors, acting with intelligence, and that\r\nenthusiasm which a common cause inspires, constitute not only a\r\nformidable, but an invincible power.[47]\r\n\r\nThe true principle of a free and popular government would seem to be, so\r\nto construct it as to give to all, or at least to a very great majority,\r\nan interest in its preservation; to found it, as other things are\r\nfounded, on men's interest. The stability of government demands that\r\nthose who desire its continuance should be more powerful than those who\r\ndesire its dissolution. This power, of course, is not always to be\r\nmeasured by mere numbers. Education, wealth, talents, are all parts and\r\nelements of the general aggregate of power; but numbers, nevertheless,\r\nconstitute ordinarily the most important consideration, unless, indeed,\r\nthere be _a military force_ in the hands of the few, by which they can\r\ncontrol the many. In this country we have actually existing systems of\r\ngovernment, in the maintenance of which, it should seem, a great\r\nmajority, both in numbers and in other means of power and influence,\r\nmust see their interest. But this state of things is not brought about\r\nsolely by written political constitutions, or the mere manner of\r\norganizing the government; but also by the laws which regulate the\r\ndescent and transmission of property. The freest government, if it could\r\nexist, would not be long acceptable, if the tendency of the laws were to\r\ncreate a rapid accumulation of property in few hands, and to render the\r\ngreat mass of the population dependent and penniless. In such a case,\r\nthe popular power would be likely to break in upon the rights of\r\nproperty, or else the influence of property to limit and control the\r\nexercise of popular power. Universal suffrage, for example, could not\r\nlong exist in a community where there was great inequality of property.\r\nThe holders of estates would be obliged, in such case, in some way to\r\nrestrain the right of suffrage, or else such right of suffrage would,\r\nbefore long, divide the property. In the nature of things, those who\r\nhave not property, and see their neighbors possess much more than they\r\nthink them to need, cannot be favorable to laws made for the protection\r\nof property. When this class becomes numerous, it grows clamorous. It\r\nlooks on property as its prey and plunder, and is naturally ready, at\r\nall times, for violence and revolution.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, then, to be the part of political wisdom to found\r\ngovernment on property; and to establish such distribution of property,\r\nby the laws which regulate its transmission and alienation, as to\r\ninterest the great majority of society in the support of the government.\r\nThis is, I imagine, the true theory and the actual practice of our\r\nrepublican institutions. With property divided as we have it, no other\r\ngovernment than that of a republic could be maintained, even were we\r\nfoolish enough to desire it. There is reason, therefore, to expect a\r\nlong continuance of our system. Party and passion, doubtless, may\r\nprevail at times, and much temporary mischief be done. Even modes and\r\nforms may be changed, and perhaps for the worse. But a great revolution\r\nin regard to property must take place, before our governments can be\r\nmoved from their republican basis, unless they be violently struck off\r\nby military power. The people possess the property, more emphatically\r\nthan it could ever be said of the people of any other country, and they\r\ncan have no interest to overturn a government which protects that\r\nproperty by equal laws.\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed, that this state of things possesses too strong\r\ntendencies towards the production of a dead and uninteresting level in\r\nsociety. Such tendencies are sufficiently counteracted by the infinite\r\ndiversities in the characters and fortunes of individuals. Talent,\r\nactivity, industry, and enterprise tend at all times to produce\r\ninequality and distinction; and there is room still for the accumulation\r\nof wealth, with its great advantages, to all reasonable and useful\r\nextent. It has been often urged against the state of society in America,\r\nthat it furnishes no class of men of fortune and leisure. This may be\r\npartly true, but it is not entirely so, and the evil, if it be one,\r\nwould affect rather the progress of taste and literature, than the\r\ngeneral prosperity of the people. But the promotion of taste and\r\nliterature cannot be primary objects of political institutions; and if\r\nthey could, it might be doubted whether, in the long course of things,\r\nas much is not gained by a wide diffusion of general knowledge, as is\r\nlost by diminishing the number of those who are enabled by fortune and\r\nleisure to devote themselves exclusively to scientific and literary\r\npursuits. However this may be, it is to be considered that it is the\r\nspirit of our system to be equal and general, and if there be particular\r\ndisadvantages incident to this, they are far more than counterbalanced\r\nby the benefits which weigh against them. The important concerns of\r\nsociety are generally conducted, in all countries, by the men of\r\nbusiness and practical ability; and even in matters of taste and\r\nliterature, the advantages of mere leisure are liable to be overrated.\r\nIf there exist adequate means of education and a love of letters be\r\nexcited, that love will find its way to the object of its desire,\r\nthrough the crowd and pressure of the most busy society.\r\n\r\nConnected with this division of property, and the consequent\r\nparticipation of the great mass of people in its possession and\r\nenjoyments, is the system of representation, which is admirably\r\naccommodated to our condition, better understood among us, and more\r\nfamiliarly and extensively practised, in the higher and in the lower\r\ndepartments of government, than it has been by any other people. Great\r\nfacility has been given to this in New England by the early division\r\nof the country into townships or small districts, in which all\r\nconcerns of local police are regulated, and in which representatives\r\nto the legislature are elected. Nothing can exceed the utility of\r\nthese little bodies. They are so many councils or parliaments, in\r\nwhich common interests are discussed, and useful knowledge acquired\r\nand communicated.\r\n\r\nThe division of governments into departments, and the division, again,\r\nof the legislative department into two chambers, are essential\r\nprovisions in our system. This last, although not new in itself, yet\r\nseems to be new in its application to governments wholly popular. The\r\nGrecian republics, it is plain, knew nothing of it; and in Rome, the\r\ncheck and balance of legislative power, such as it was, lay between the\r\npeople and the senate. Indeed, few things are more difficult than to\r\nascertain accurately the true nature and construction of the Roman\r\ncommonwealth. The relative power of the senate and the people, of the\r\nconsuls and the tribunes, appears not to have been at all times the\r\nsame, nor at any time accurately defined or strictly observed. Cicero,\r\nindeed, describes to us an admirable arrangement of political power, and\r\na balance of the constitution, in that beautiful passage, in which he\r\ncompares the democracies of Greece with the Roman commonwealth. \"O morem\r\npreclarum, disciplinamque, quam a majoribus accepimus, si quidem\r\nteneremus! sed nescio quo pacto jam de manibus elabitur. Nullam enim\r\nilli nostri sapientissimi et sanctissimi viri vim concionis esse\r\nvoluerunt, quae scisseret plebs, aut quae populus juberet; summota\r\nconcione, distributis partibus, tributim et centuriatim descriptis\r\nordinibus, classibus, aetatibus, auditis auctoribus, re multos dies\r\npromulgata et cognita, juberi vetarique voluerunt. Graecorum autem totae\r\nrespublicae sedentis concionis temeritate administrantur.\"[48]\r\n\r\nBut at what time this wise system existed in this perfection at Rome, no\r\nproofs remain to show. Her constitution, originally framed for a\r\nmonarchy, never seemed to be adjusted in its several parts after the\r\nexpulsion of the kings. Liberty there was, but it was a disputatious, an\r\nuncertain, an ill-secured liberty. The patrician and plebeian orders,\r\ninstead of being matched and joined, each in its just place and\r\nproportion, to sustain the fabric of the state, were rather like hostile\r\npowers, in perpetual conflict. With us, an attempt has been made, and so\r\nfar not without success, to divide representation into chambers, and, by\r\ndifference of age, character, qualification, or mode of election, to\r\nestablish salutary checks, in governments altogether elective.\r\n\r\nHaving detained you so long with these observations, I must yet advert\r\nto another most interesting topic,--the Free Schools. In this\r\nparticular, New England may be allowed to claim, I think, a merit of a\r\npeculiar character. She early adopted, and has constantly maintained the\r\nprinciple, that it is the undoubted right and the bounden duty of\r\ngovernment to provide for the instruction of all youth. That which is\r\nelsewhere left to chance or to charity, we secure by law.[49] For the\r\npurpose of public instruction, we hold every man subject to taxation in\r\nproportion to his property, and we look not to the question, whether he\r\nhimself have, or have not, children to be benefited by the education for\r\nwhich he pays. We regard it as a wise and liberal system of police, by\r\nwhich property, and life, and the peace of society are secured. We seek\r\nto prevent in some measure the extension of the penal code, by inspiring\r\na salutary and conservative principle of virtue and of knowledge in an\r\nearly age. We strive to excite a feeling of respectability, and a sense\r\nof character, by enlarging the capacity and increasing the sphere of\r\nintellectual enjoyment. By general instruction, we seek, as far as\r\npossible, to purify the whole moral atmosphere; to keep good sentiments\r\nuppermost, and to turn the strong current of feeling and opinion, as\r\nwell as the censures of the law and the denunciations of religion,\r\nagainst immorality and crime. We hope for a security beyond the law, and\r\nabove the law, in the prevalence of an enlightened and well-principled\r\nmoral sentiment. We hope to continue and prolong the time, when, in the\r\nvillages and farm-houses of New England, there may be undisturbed sleep\r\nwithin unbarred doors. And knowing that our government rests directly on\r\nthe public will, in order that we may preserve it we endeavor to give a\r\nsafe and proper direction to that public will. We do not, indeed, expect\r\nall men to be philosophers or statesmen; but we confidently trust, and\r\nour expectation of the duration of our system of government rests on\r\nthat trust, that, by the diffusion of general knowledge and good and\r\nvirtuous sentiments, the political fabric may be secure, as well against\r\nopen violence and overthrow, as against the slow, but sure, undermining\r\nof licentiousness.\r\n\r\nWe know that, at the present time, an attempt is making in the English\r\nParliament to provide by law for the education of the poor, and that a\r\ngentleman of distinguished character (Mr. Brougham) has taken the lead\r\nin presenting a plan to government for carrying that purpose into\r\neffect. And yet, although the representatives of the three kingdoms\r\nlistened to him with astonishment as well as delight, we hear no\r\nprinciples with which we ourselves have not been familiar from youth; we\r\nsee nothing in the plan but an approach towards that system which has\r\nbeen established in New England for more than a century and a half. It\r\nis said that in England not more than _one child in fifteen_ possesses\r\nthe means of being taught to read and write; in Wales, _one in twenty_;\r\nin France, until lately, when some improvement was made, not more than\r\n_one in thirty-five_. Now, it is hardly too strong to say, that in New\r\nEngland _every child possesses_ such means. It would be difficult to\r\nfind an instance to the contrary, unless where it should be owing to the\r\nnegligence of the parent; and, in truth, the means are actually used and\r\nenjoyed by nearly every one. A youth of fifteen, of either sex, who\r\ncannot both read and write, is very seldom to be found. Who can make\r\nthis comparison, or contemplate this spectacle, without delight and a\r\nfeeling of just pride? Does any history show property more beneficently\r\napplied? Did any government ever subject the property of those who have\r\nestates to a burden, for a purpose more favorable to the poor, or more\r\nuseful to the whole community?\r\n\r\nA conviction of the importance of public instruction was one of the\r\nearliest sentiments of our ancestors. No lawgiver of ancient or modern\r\ntimes has expressed more just opinions, or adopted wiser measures, than\r\nthe early records of the Colony of Plymouth show to have prevailed here.\r\nAssembled on this very spot, a hundred and fifty-three years ago, the\r\nlegislature of this Colony declared, \"Forasmuch as the maintenance of\r\ngood literature doth much tend to the advancement of the weal and\r\nflourishing state of societies and republics, this Court doth therefore\r\norder, that in whatever township in this government, consisting of fifty\r\nfamilies or upwards, any meet man shall be obtained to teach a grammar\r\nschool, such township shall allow at least twelve pounds, to be raised\r\nby rate on all the inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nHaving provided that all youth should be instructed in the elements of\r\nlearning by the institution of free schools, our ancestors had yet\r\nanother duty to perform. Men were to be educated for the professions and\r\nthe public. For this purpose they founded the University, and with\r\nincredible zeal and perseverance they cherished and supported it,\r\nthrough all trials and discouragements.[50] On the subject of the\r\nUniversity, it is not possible for a son of New England to think without\r\npleasure, or to speak without emotion. Nothing confers more honor on the\r\nState where it is established, or more utility on the country at large.\r\nA respectable university is an establishment which must be the work of\r\ntime. If pecuniary means were not wanting, no new institution could\r\npossess character and respectability at once. We owe deep obligation to\r\nour ancestors, who began, almost on the moment of their arrival, the\r\nwork of building up this institution.\r\n\r\nAlthough established in a different government, the Colony of Plymouth\r\nmanifested warm friendship for Harvard College. At an early period, its\r\ngovernment took measures to promote a general subscription throughout\r\nall the towns in this Colony, in aid of its small funds. Other colleges\r\nwere subsequently founded and endowed, in other places, as the ability\r\nof the people allowed; and we may flatter ourselves, that the means of\r\neducation at present enjoyed in New England are not only adequate to the\r\ndiffusion of the elements of knowledge among all classes, but sufficient\r\nalso for respectable attainments in literature and the sciences.\r\n\r\nLastly, our ancestors established their system of government on morality\r\nand religious sentiment. Moral habits, they believed, cannot safely be\r\ntrusted on any other foundation than religious principle, nor any\r\ngovernment be secure which is not supported by moral habits. Living\r\nunder the heavenly light of revelation, they hoped to find all the\r\nsocial dispositions, all the duties which men owe to each other and to\r\nsociety, enforced and performed. Whatever makes men good Christians,\r\nmakes them good citizens. Our fathers came here to enjoy their religion\r\nfree and unmolested; and, at the end of two centuries, there is nothing\r\nupon which we can pronounce more confidently, nothing of which we can\r\nexpress a more deep and earnest conviction, than of the inestimable\r\nimportance of that religion to man, both in regard to this life and that\r\nwhich is to come.\r\n\r\nIf the blessings of our political and social condition have not been too\r\nhighly estimated, we cannot well overrate the responsibility and duty\r\nwhich they impose upon us. We hold these institutions of government,\r\nreligion, and learning, to be transmitted, as well as enjoyed. We are in\r\nthe line of conveyance, through which whatever has been obtained by the\r\nspirit and efforts of our ancestors is to be communicated to our\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nWe are bound to maintain public liberty, and, by the example of our own\r\nsystems, to convince the world that order and law, religion and\r\nmorality, the rights of conscience, the rights of persons, and the\r\nrights of property, may all be preserved and secured, in the most\r\nperfect manner, by a government entirely and purely elective. If we fail\r\nin this, our disaster will be signal, and will furnish an argument,\r\nstronger than has yet been found, in support of those opinions which\r\nmaintain that government can rest safely on nothing but power and\r\ncoercion. As far as experience may show errors in our establishments, we\r\nare bound to correct them; and if any practices exist contrary to the\r\nprinciples of justice and humanity within the reach of our laws or our\r\ninfluence, we are inexcusable if we do not exert ourselves to restrain\r\nand abolish them.\r\n\r\nI deem it my duty on this occasion to suggest, that the land is not yet\r\nwholly free from the contamination of a traffic, at which every feeling\r\nof humanity must for ever revolt,--I mean the African slave-trade.[51]\r\nNeither public sentiment, nor the law, has hitherto been able entirely\r\nto put an end to this odious and abominable trade. At the moment when\r\nGod in his mercy has blessed the Christian world with a universal peace,\r\nthere is reason to fear, that, to the disgrace of the Christian name and\r\ncharacter, new efforts are making for the extension of this trade by\r\nsubjects and citizens of Christian states, in whose hearts there dwell\r\nno sentiments of humanity or of justice, and over whom neither the fear\r\nof God nor the fear of man exercises a control. In the sight of our law,\r\nthe African slave-trader is a pirate and a felon; and in the sight of\r\nHeaven, an offender far beyond the ordinary depth of human guilt. There\r\nis no brighter page of our history, than that which records the measures\r\nwhich have been adopted by the government at an early day, and at\r\ndifferent times since, for the suppression of this traffic; and I would\r\ncall on all the true sons of New England to cooeperate with the laws of\r\nman, and the justice of Heaven. If there be, within the extent of our\r\nknowledge or influence, any participation in this traffic, let us pledge\r\nourselves here, upon the rock of Plymouth, to extirpate and destroy it.\r\nIt is not fit that the land of the Pilgrims should bear the shame\r\nlonger. I hear the sound of the hammer, I see the smoke of the furnaces\r\nwhere manacles and fetters are still forged for human limbs. I see the\r\nvisages of those who by stealth and at midnight labor in this work of\r\nhell, foul and dark, as may become the artificers of such instruments of\r\nmisery and torture. Let that spot be purified, or let it cease to be of\r\nNew England. Let it be purified, or let it be set aside from the\r\nChristian world; let it be put out of the circle of human sympathies and\r\nhuman regards, and let civilized man henceforth have no communion with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI would invoke those who fill the seats of justice, and all who minister\r\nat her altar, that they execute the wholesome and necessary severity of\r\nthe law. I invoke the ministers of our religion, that they proclaim its\r\ndenunciation of these crimes, and add its solemn sanctions to the\r\nauthority of human laws. If the pulpit be silent whenever or wherever\r\nthere may be a sinner bloody with this guilt within the hearing of its\r\nvoice, the pulpit is false to its trust. I call on the fair merchant,\r\nwho has reaped his harvest upon the seas, that he assist in scourging\r\nfrom those seas the worst pirates that ever infested them. That ocean,\r\nwhich seems to wave with a gentle magnificence to waft the burden of an\r\nhonest commerce, and to roll along its treasures with a conscious\r\npride,--that ocean, which hardy industry regards, even when the winds\r\nhave ruffled its surface, as a field of grateful toil,--what is it to\r\nthe victim of this oppression, when he is brought to its shores, and\r\nlooks forth upon it, for the first time, loaded with chains, and\r\nbleeding with stripes? What is it to him but a wide-spread prospect of\r\nsuffering, anguish, and death? Nor do the skies smile longer, nor is the\r\nair longer fragrant to him. The sun is cast down from heaven. An inhuman\r\nand accursed traffic has cut him off in his manhood, or in his youth,\r\nfrom every enjoyment belonging to his being, and every blessing which\r\nhis Creator intended for him.\r\n\r\nThe Christian communities send forth their emissaries of religion and\r\nletters, who stop, here and there, along the coast of the vast continent\r\nof Africa, and with painful and tedious efforts make some almost\r\nimperceptible progress in the communication of knowledge, and in the\r\ngeneral improvement of the natives who are immediately about them. Not\r\nthus slow and imperceptible is the transmission of the vices and bad\r\npassions which the subjects of Christian states carry to the land. The\r\nslave-trade having touched the coast, its influence and its evils\r\nspread, like a pestilence, over the whole continent, making savage wars\r\nmore savage and more frequent, and adding new and fierce passions to the\r\ncontests of barbarians.\r\n\r\nI pursue this topic no further, except again to say, that all\r\nChristendom, being now blessed with peace, is bound by every thing which\r\nbelongs to its character, and to the character of the present age, to\r\nput a stop to this inhuman and disgraceful traffic.\r\n\r\nWe are bound, not only to maintain the general principles of public\r\nliberty, but to support also those existing forms of government which\r\nhave so well secured its enjoyment, and so highly promoted the public\r\nprosperity. It is now more than thirty years that these States have been\r\nunited under the Federal Constitution, and whatever fortune may await\r\nthem hereafter, it is impossible that this period of their history\r\nshould not be regarded as distinguished by signal prosperity and\r\nsuccess. They must be sanguine indeed, who can hope for benefit from\r\nchange. Whatever division of the public judgment may have existed in\r\nrelation to particular measures of the government, all must agree, one\r\nshould think, in the opinion, that in its general course it has been\r\neminently productive of public happiness. Its most ardent friends could\r\nnot well have hoped from it more than it has accomplished; and those who\r\ndisbelieved or doubted ought to feel less concern about predictions\r\nwhich the event has not verified, than pleasure in the good which has\r\nbeen obtained. Whoever shall hereafter write this part of our history,\r\nalthough he may see occasional errors or defects, will be able to record\r\nno great failure in the ends and objects of government. Still less will\r\nhe be able to record any series of lawless and despotic acts, or any\r\nsuccessful usurpation. His page will contain no exhibition of provinces\r\ndepopulated, of civil authority habitually trampled down by military\r\npower, or of a community crushed by the burden of taxation. He will\r\nspeak, rather, of public liberty protected, and public happiness\r\nadvanced; of increased revenue, and population augmented beyond all\r\nexample; of the growth of commerce, manufactures, and the arts; and of\r\nthat happy condition, in which the restraint and coercion of government\r\nare almost invisible and imperceptible, and its influence felt only in\r\nthe benefits which it confers. We can entertain no better wish for our\r\ncountry, than that this government may be preserved; nor have a clearer\r\nduty than to maintain and support it in the full exercise of all its\r\njust constitutional powers.\r\n\r\nThe cause of science and literature also imposes upon us an important\r\nand delicate trust. The wealth and population of the country are now so\r\nfar advanced, as to authorize the expectation of a correct literature\r\nand a well formed taste, as well as respectable progress in the abstruse\r\nsciences. The country has risen from a state of colonial subjection; it\r\nhas established an independent government, and is now in the undisturbed\r\nenjoyment of peace and political security. The elements of knowledge are\r\nuniversally diffused, and the reading portion of the community is large.\r\nLet us hope that the present may be an auspicious era of literature. If,\r\nalmost on the day of their landing, our ancestors founded schools and\r\nendowed colleges, what obligations do not rest upon us, living under\r\ncircumstances so much more favorable both for providing and for using\r\nthe means of education? Literature becomes free institutions. It is the\r\ngraceful ornament of civil liberty, and a happy restraint on the\r\nasperities which political controversies sometimes occasion. Just taste\r\nis not only an embellishment of society, but it rises almost to the rank\r\nof the virtues, and diffuses positive good throughout the whole extent\r\nof its influence. There is a connection between right feeling and right\r\nprinciples, and truth in taste is allied with truth in morality. With\r\nnothing in our past history to discourage us, and with something in our\r\npresent condition and prospects to animate us, let us hope, that, as it\r\nis our fortune to live in an age when we may behold a wonderful\r\nadvancement of the country in all its other great interests, we may see\r\nalso equal progress and success attend the cause of letters.\r\n\r\nFinally, let us not forget the religious character of our origin. Our\r\nfathers were brought hither by their high veneration for the Christian\r\nreligion. They journeyed by its light, and labored in its hope. They\r\nsought to incorporate its principles with the elements of their society,\r\nand to diffuse its influence through all their institutions, civil,\r\npolitical, or literary. Let us cherish these sentiments, and extend this\r\ninfluence still more widely; in the full conviction, that that is the\r\nhappiest society which partakes in the highest degree of the mild and\r\npeaceful spirit of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe hours of this day are rapidly flying, and this occasion will soon be\r\npassed. Neither we nor our children can expect to behold its return.\r\nThey are in the distant regions of futurity, they exist only in the\r\nall-creating power of God, who shall stand here a hundred years hence,\r\nto trace, through us, their descent from the Pilgrims, and to survey, as\r\nwe have now surveyed, the progress of their country, during the lapse of\r\na century. We would anticipate their concurrence with us in our\r\nsentiments of deep regard for our common ancestors. We would anticipate\r\nand partake the pleasure with which they will then recount the steps of\r\nNew England's advancement. On the morning of that day, although it will\r\nnot disturb us in our repose, the voice of acclamation and gratitude,\r\ncommencing on the Rock of Plymouth, shall be transmitted through\r\nmillions of the sons of the Pilgrims, till it lose itself in the murmurs\r\nof the Pacific seas.\r\n\r\nWe would leave for the consideration of those who shall then occupy our\r\nplaces, some proof that we hold the blessings transmitted from our\r\nfathers in just estimation; some proof of our attachment to the cause of\r\ngood government, and of civil and religious liberty; some proof of a\r\nsincere and ardent desire to promote every thing which may enlarge the\r\nunderstandings and improve the hearts of men. And when, from the long\r\ndistance of a hundred years, they shall look back upon us, they shall\r\nknow, at least, that we possessed affections, which, running backward\r\nand warming with gratitude for what our ancestors have done for our\r\nhappiness, run forward also to our posterity, and meet them with cordial\r\nsalutation, ere yet they have arrived on the shore of being.\r\n\r\nAdvance, then, ye future generations! We would hail you, as you rise in\r\nyour long succession, to fill the places which we now fill, and to taste\r\nthe blessings of existence where we are passing, and soon shall have\r\npassed, our own human duration. We bid you welcome to this pleasant land\r\nof the fathers. We bid you welcome to the healthful skies and the\r\nverdant fields of New England. We greet your accession to the great\r\ninheritance which we have enjoyed. We welcome you to the blessings of\r\ngood government and religious liberty. We welcome you to the treasures\r\nof science and the delights of learning. We welcome you to the\r\ntranscendent sweets of domestic life, to the happiness of kindred, and\r\nparents, and children. We welcome you to the immeasurable blessings of\r\nrational existence, the immortal hope of Christianity, and the light of\r\neverlasting truth!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [33] A Discourse delivered at Plymouth, on the 22d of December, 1820.\r\n\r\n   [34] An interesting account of the Rock may be found in Dr. Thacher's\r\n        History of the Town of Plymouth, pp. 29, 198, 199.\r\n\r\n   [35] See Note A, at the end of the Discourse.\r\n\r\n   [36] For notices of Carver, Bradford, Standish, Brewster, and Allerton,\r\n        see Young's Chronicles of Plymouth and Massachusetts; Morton's\r\n        Memorial, p. 126; Belknap's American Biography, Vol. II.;\r\n        Hutchinson's History, Vol. II., App., pp. 456 _et seq._;\r\n        Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society; Winthrop's\r\n        Journal; and Thacher's History.\r\n\r\n   [37] For the original name of what is now _Plymouth_, see Lives of\r\n        American Governors, p. 38, note, a work prepared with great care\r\n        by J.

Page 8.\r\n\r\nThe allusion in the Discourse is to the large historical painting of the\r\nLanding of the Pilgrims at Plymouth, executed by Henry Sargent, Esq., of\r\nBoston, and, with great liberality, presented by him to the Pilgrim\r\nSociety. It appeared in their hall (of which it forms the chief\r\nornament) for the first time at the celebration of 1824. It represents\r\nthe principal personages of the company at the moment of landing, with\r\nthe Indian Samoset, who approaches them with a friendly welcome. A very\r\ncompetent judge, himself a distinguished artist, the late venerable\r\nColonel Trumbull, has pronounced that this painting has great merit. An\r\ninteresting account of it will be found in Dr. Thacher's History of\r\nPlymouth, pp. 249 and 257.\r\n\r\nAn historical painting, by Robert N. Weir, Esq., of the largest size,\r\nrepresenting the embarkation of the Pilgrims from Delft-Haven, in\r\nHolland, and executed by order of Congress, fills one of the panels of\r\nthe Rotunda of the Capitol at Washington. The moment chosen by the\r\nartist for the action of the picture is that in which the venerable\r\npastor Robinson, with tears, and benedictions, and prayers to Heaven,\r\ndismisses the beloved members of his little flock to the perils and the\r\nhopes of their great enterprise. The characters of the personages\r\nintroduced are indicated with discrimination and power, and the\r\naccessories of the work marked with much taste and skill. It is a\r\npainting of distinguished historical interest and of great artistic\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\nThe \"Landing of the Pilgrims\" has also been made the subject of a very\r\ninteresting painting by Mr. Flagg, intended to represent the deep\r\nreligious feeling which so strikingly characterized the first settlers\r\nof New England. With this object in view, the central figure is that of\r\nElder Brewster. It is a picture of cabinet size, and is in possession of\r\na gentleman of New Haven, descended from Elder Brewster, and of that\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE B. Page 38.\r\n\r\nAs the opinion of contemporaneous thinkers on this important subject\r\ncannot fail to interest the general reader, it is deemed proper to\r\ninsert here the following extract from a letter, written in 1849, to\r\nshow how powerfully the truths uttered in 1820, in the spirit of\r\nprophecy, as it were, impressed themselves upon certain minds, and how\r\nclosely the verification of the prediction has been watched.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I do not remember any political prophecy, founded on the spirit of a\r\nwide and far-reaching statesmanship, that has been so remarkably\r\nfulfilled as the one made by Mr. Webster, in his Discourse delivered at\r\nPlymouth in 1820, on the effect which the laws of succession to property\r\nin France, then in operation, would be likely to produce on the forms\r\nand working of the French government. But to understand what he said,\r\nand what he foresaw, I must explain a little what had been the course of\r\nlegislation in France on which his predictions were founded.\r\n\r\n\"Before the Revolution of 1789, there had been a great accumulation\r\nof the landed property of the country, and, indeed, of all its\r\nproperty,--by means of laws of entail, _majorats_, and other legal\r\ncontrivances,--in the hands of the privileged classes; chiefly in\r\nthose of the nobility and the clergy. The injury and injustice done by\r\nlong continued legislation in this direction were obviously great; and\r\nit was not, perhaps, unnatural, that the opposite course to that which\r\nhad brought on the mischief should be deemed the best one to cure it.\r\nAt any rate, such was the course taken.\r\n\r\n\"In 1791 a law was passed, preventing any man from having any interest\r\nbeyond the period of his own life in any of his property, real,\r\npersonal, or mixed, and distributing all his possessions for him,\r\nimmediately after his death, among his children, in equal shares, or if\r\nhe left no children, then among his next of kin, on the same principle.\r\nThis law, with a slight modification, made under the influence of\r\nRobespierre, was in force till 1800. But the period was entirely\r\nrevolutionary, and probably quite as much property changed hands from\r\nviolence and the consequences of violence, during the nine years it\r\ncontinued, as was transmitted by the laws that directly controlled its\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n\"With the coming in of Bonaparte, however, there was established a new\r\norder of things, which has continued, with little modification, ever\r\nsince, and has had its full share in working out the great changes in\r\nFrench society which we now witness. A few experiments were first made,\r\nand then the great Civil Code, often called the _Code Napoleon_, was\r\nadopted. This was in 1804. By this remarkable code, which is still in\r\nforce, a man, if he has but one child, can give away by his last will,\r\nas he pleases, half of his property,--the law insuring the other half to\r\nthe child; if he has two children, then he can so give away only one\r\nthird,--the law requiring the other two thirds to be given equally to\r\nthe two children; if three, then only one fourth, under similar\r\nconditions; but if he has a greater number, it restricts the rights of\r\nthe parent more and more, and makes it more and more difficult for him\r\nto distribute his property according to his own judgment; the\r\nrestrictions embarrassing him even in his lifetime.\r\n\r\n\"The consequences of such laws are, from their nature, very slowly\r\ndeveloped. When Mr. Webster spoke in 1820, the French code had been in\r\noperation sixteen years, and similar principles had prevailed for nearly\r\na generation. But still its wide results were not even suspected. Those\r\nwho had treated the subject at all supposed that the tendency was to\r\nbreak up the great estates in France, and make the larger number of the\r\nholders of small estates more accessible to the influence of the\r\ngovernment, then a limited monarchy, and so render it stronger and more\r\ndespotic.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Webster held a different opinion. He said, 'In respect, however, to\r\nthe recent law of succession in France, to which I have alluded, _I\r\nwould, presumptuously perhaps, hazard a conjecture, that, if the\r\ngovernment do not change the law, the law in half a century will change\r\nthe government; and that this change will be, not in favor of the power\r\nof the crown, as some European writers have supposed, but against it_.\r\nThose writers only reason upon what they think correct general\r\nprinciples, in relation to this subject. They acknowledge a want of\r\nexperience. Here we have had that experience; and we know that a\r\nmultitude of small proprietors, acting with intelligence, and that\r\nenthusiasm which a common cause inspires, constitute not only a\r\nformidable, but an invincible power.'\r\n\r\n\"In less than six years after Mr. Webster uttered this remarkable\r\nprediction, the king of France himself, at the opening of the\r\nLegislative Chambers, thus strangely echoed it:--'Legislation ought to\r\nprovide, by successive improvements, for all the wants of society. The\r\nprogressive partitioning of landed estates, essentially contrary to the\r\nspirit of a monarchical government, would enfeeble the guaranties which\r\nthe charter has given to my throne and to my subjects. Measures will be\r\nproposed to you, gentlemen, to establish the consistency which ought to\r\nexist between the political law and the civil law, and to preserve the\r\npatrimony of families, without restricting the liberty of disposing of\r\none's property. The preservation of families is connected with, and\r\naffords a guaranty to, political stability, which is the first want of\r\nstates, and which is especially that of France, after so many\r\nvicissitudes.'\r\n\r\n\"Still, the results to which such subdivision and comminution of\r\nproperty tended were not foreseen even in France. The Revolution of 1830\r\ncame, and revealed a part of them; for that revolution was made by the\r\ninfluence of men possessing very moderate estates, who believed that the\r\nguaranties of a government like that of the elder branch of the\r\nBourbons were not sufficient for their safety. But when the revolution\r\nwas made, and the younger branch of the Bourbons reigned instead of the\r\nelder, the laws for the descent of property continued to be the same,\r\nand the subdivision went on as if it were an admitted benefit to\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\"In consequence of this, in 1844 it was found that there were in France\r\nat least five millions and a half of families, or about twenty-seven\r\nmillions of souls, who were proprietary families, and that of these\r\nabout four millions of families had each less than nine English acres to\r\nthe family on the average. Of course, a vast majority of these\r\ntwenty-seven millions of persons, though they might be interested in\r\nsome small portion of the soil, were really poor, and multitudes of them\r\nwere dependent.\r\n\r\n\"Now, therefore, the results began to appear in a practical form. One\r\nthird of all the rental of France was discovered to be absolutely\r\nmortgaged, and another third was swallowed up by other encumbrances,\r\nleaving but one third free for the use and benefit of its owners. In\r\nother words, a great proportion of the people of France were embarrassed\r\nand poor, and a great proportion of the remainder were fast becoming\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\"Such a state of things produced, of course, a wide-spread social\r\nuneasiness. Part of this uneasiness was directed against the existing\r\ngovernment; another and more formidable portion was directed against\r\n_all_ government, and against the very institution of property. The\r\nconvulsion of 1848 followed; France is still unsettled; and Mr.\r\nWebster's prophecy seems still to be in the course of a portentous\r\nfulfilment.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the London Quarterly Review for 1846 there is an interesting\r\ndiscussion on so much of the matter as relates to the subdivision of\r\nreal estate for agricultural purposes in France, as far as it had then\r\nadvanced, and from which many of the facts here alluded to are taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs early as 1776, some steps were taken toward the commemoration of the\r\nbattle of Bunker Hill and the fall of General Warren, who was buried\r\nupon the hill the day after the action. The Massachusetts Lodge of\r\nMasons, over which he presided, applied to the provisional government of\r\nMassachusetts, for permission to take up his remains and to bury them\r\nwith the usual solemnities. The council granted this request, on\r\ncondition that it should be carried into effect in such a manner that\r\nthe government of _the Colony_ might have an opportunity to erect a\r\nmonument to his memory. A funeral procession was had, and a Eulogy on\r\nGeneral Warren was delivered by Perez Morton, but no measures were taken\r\ntoward building a monument.\r\n\r\nA resolution was adopted by the Congress of the United States on the 8th\r\nof April, 1777, directing that monuments should be erected to the memory\r\nof General Warren, in Boston, and of General Mercer, at Fredericksburg;\r\nbut this resolution has remained to the present time unexecuted.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of November, 1794, a committee was appointed by King\r\nSolomon's Lodge, at Charlestown,[52] to take measures for the erection\r\nof a monument to the memory of General Joseph Warren at the expense of\r\nthe Lodge. This resolution was promptly carried into effect. The land\r\nfor this purpose was presented to the Lodge by the Hon. James Russell,\r\nof Charlestown, and it was dedicated with appropriate ceremonies on the\r\n2d of December, 1794. It was a wooden pillar of the Tuscan order,\r\neighteen feet in height, raised on a pedestal eight feet square, and of\r\nan elevation of ten feet from the ground. The pillar was surmounted by a\r\ngilt urn. An appropriate inscription was placed on the south side of the\r\npedestal.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1818, a committee of the Legislature of Massachusetts was\r\nappointed to consider the expediency of building a monument of American\r\nmarble to the memory of General Warren, but this proposal was not\r\ncarried into effect.\r\n\r\nAs the half-century from the date of the battle drew toward a close, a\r\nstronger feeling of the duty of commemorating it began to be awakened in\r\nthe community. Among those who from the first manifested the greatest\r\ninterest in the subject, was the late William Tudor, Esq. He expressed\r\nthe wish, in a letter still preserved, to see upon the battle-ground\r\n\"the noblest monument in the world,\" and he was so ardent and\r\npersevering in urging the project, that it has been stated that he first\r\nconceived the idea of it. The steps taken in execution of the project,\r\nfrom the earliest private conferences among the gentlemen first engaged\r\nin it to its final completion, are accurately sketched by Mr. Richard\r\nFrothingham, Jr., in his valuable History of the Siege of Boston. All\r\nthe material facts contained in this note are derived from his chapter\r\non the Bunker Hill Monument. After giving an account of the organization\r\nof the society, the measures adopted for the collection of funds, and\r\nthe deliberations on the form of the monument, Mr. Frothingham proceeds\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  \"It was at this stage of the enterprise that the directors proposed\r\n  to lay the corner-stone of the monument, and ground was broken (June\r\n  7th) for this purpose. As a mark of respect to the liberality and\r\n  patriotism of King Solomon's Lodge, they invited the Grand Master of\r\n  the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts to perform the ceremony. They also\r\n  invited General Lafayette to accompany the President of the\r\n  Association, Hon. Daniel Webster, and assist in it.\r\n\r\n  \"This celebration was unequalled in magnificence by any thing of the\r\n  kind that had been seen in New England. The morning proved\r\n  propitious. The air was cool, the sky was clear, and timely showers\r\n  the previous day had brightened the vesture of nature into its\r\n  loveliest hue. Delighted thousands flocked into Boston to bear a\r\n  part in the proceedings, or to witness the spectacle. At about ten\r\n  o'clock a procession moved from the State House towards Bunker Hill.\r\n  The military, in their fine uniforms, formed the van. About two\r\n  hundred veterans of the Revolution, of whom forty were survivors of\r\n  the battle, rode in barouches next to the escort. These venerable\r\n  men, the relics of a past generation, with emaciated frames,\r\n  tottering limbs, and trembling voices, constituted a touching\r\n  spectacle. Some wore, as honorable decorations, their old fighting\r\n  equipments, and some bore the scars of still more honorable wounds.\r\n  Glistening eyes constituted their answer to the enthusiastic cheers\r\n  of the grateful multitudes who lined their pathway and cheered their\r\n  progress. To this patriot band succeeded the Bunker Hill Monument\r\n  Association. Then the Masonic fraternity, in their splendid regalia,\r\n  thousands in number. Then Lafayette, continually welcomed by tokens\r\n  of love and gratitude, and the invited guests. Then a long array of\r\n  societies, with their various badges and banners. It was a splendid\r\n  procession, and of such length that the front nearly reached\r\n  Charlestown Bridge ere the rear had left Boston Common. It proceeded\r\n  to Breed's Hill, where the Grand Master of the Freemasons, the\r\n  President of the Monument Association, and General Lafayette,\r\n  performed the ceremony of laying the corner-stone, in the presence\r\n  of a vast concourse of people.\"\r\n\r\nThe procession then moved to a spacious amphitheatre on the northern\r\ndeclivity of the hill, when the following address was delivered by Mr.\r\nWebster, in the presence of as great a multitude as was ever perhaps\r\nassembled within the sound of a human voice.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [52] General Warren, at the time of his decease, was Grand Master of\r\n        the Masonic Lodges in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT.[53]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis uncounted multitude before me and around me proves the feeling\r\nwhich the occasion has excited. These thousands of human faces, glowing\r\nwith sympathy and joy, and from the impulses of a common gratitude\r\nturned reverently to heaven in this spacious temple of the firmament,\r\nproclaim that the day, the place, and the purpose of our assembling have\r\nmade a deep impression on our hearts.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, there be any thing in local association fit to affect the\r\nmind of man, we need not strive to repress the emotions which agitate us\r\nhere. We are among the sepulchres of our fathers. We are on ground,\r\ndistinguished by their valor, their constancy, and the shedding of their\r\nblood. We are here, not to fix an uncertain date in our annals, nor to\r\ndraw into notice an obscure and unknown spot. If our humble purpose had\r\nnever been conceived, if we ourselves had never been born, the 17th of\r\nJune, 1775, would have been a day on which all subsequent history would\r\nhave poured its light, and the eminence where we stand a point of\r\nattraction to the eyes of successive generations. But we are Americans.\r\nWe live in what may be called the early age of this great continent; and\r\nwe know that our posterity, through all time, are here to enjoy and\r\nsuffer the allotments of humanity. We see before us a probable train of\r\ngreat events; we know that our own fortunes have been happily cast; and\r\nit is natural, therefore, that we should be moved by the contemplation\r\nof occurrences which have guided our destiny before many of us were\r\nborn, and settled the condition in which we should pass that portion of\r\nour existence which God allows to men on earth.\r\n\r\nWe do not read even of the discovery of this continent, without feeling\r\nsomething of a personal interest in the event; without being reminded\r\nhow much it has affected our own fortunes and our own existence. It\r\nwould be still more unnatural for us, therefore, than for others, to\r\ncontemplate with unaffected minds that interesting, I may say that most\r\ntouching and pathetic scene, when the great discoverer of America stood\r\non the deck of his shattered bark, the shades of night falling on the\r\nsea, yet no man sleeping; tossed on the billows of an unknown ocean, yet\r\nthe stronger billows of alternate hope and despair tossing his own\r\ntroubled thoughts; extending forward his harassed frame, straining\r\nwestward his anxious and eager eyes, till Heaven at last granted him a\r\nmoment of rapture and ecstasy, in blessing his vision with the sight of\r\nthe unknown world.\r\n\r\nNearer to our times, more closely connected with our fates, and\r\ntherefore still more interesting to our feelings and affections, is the\r\nsettlement of our own country by colonists from England. We cherish\r\nevery memorial of these worthy ancestors; we celebrate their patience\r\nand fortitude; we admire their daring enterprise; we teach our children\r\nto venerate their piety; and we are justly proud of being descended from\r\nmen who have set the world an example of founding civil institutions on\r\nthe great and united principles of human freedom and human knowledge. To\r\nus, their children, the story of their labors and sufferings can never\r\nbe without its interest. We shall not stand unmoved on the shore of\r\nPlymouth, while the sea continues to wash it; nor will our brethren in\r\nanother early and ancient Colony forget the place of its first\r\nestablishment, till their river shall cease to flow by it.[54] No vigor\r\nof youth, no maturity of manhood, will lead the nation to forget the\r\nspots where its infancy was cradled and defended.\r\n\r\nBut the great event in the history of the continent, which we are now\r\nmet here to commemorate, that prodigy of modern times, at once the\r\nwonder and the blessing of the world, is the American Revolution. In a\r\nday of extraordinary prosperity and happiness, of high national honor,\r\ndistinction, and power, we are brought together, in this place, by our\r\nlove of country, by our admiration of exalted character, by our\r\ngratitude for signal services and patriotic devotion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Society whose organ I am[55] was formed for the purpose of rearing\r\nsome honorable and durable monument to the memory of the early friends\r\nof American Independence. They have thought, that for this object no\r\ntime could be more propitious than the present prosperous and peaceful\r\nperiod; that no place could claim preference over this memorable spot;\r\nand that no day could be more auspicious to the undertaking, than the\r\nanniversary of the battle which was here fought. The foundation of that\r\nmonument we have now laid. With solemnities suited to the occasion, with\r\nprayers to Almighty God for his blessing and in the midst of this cloud\r\nof witnesses, we have begun the work. We trust it will be prosecuted,\r\nand that, springing from a broad foundation, rising high in massive\r\nsolidity and unadorned grandeur, it may remain as long as Heaven permits\r\nthe works of man to last, a fit emblem, both of the events in memory of\r\nwhich it is raised, and of the gratitude of those who have reared it.\r\n\r\nWe know, indeed, that the record of illustrious actions is most safely\r\ndeposited in the universal remembrance of mankind. We know, that if we\r\ncould cause this structure to ascend, not only till it reached the\r\nskies, but till it pierced them, its broad surfaces could still contain\r\nbut part of that which, in an age of knowledge, hath already been spread\r\nover the earth, and which history charges itself with making known to\r\nall future times. We know that no inscription on entablatures less broad\r\nthan the earth itself can carry information of the events we commemorate\r\nwhere it has not already gone; and that no structure, which shall not\r\noutlive the duration of letters and knowledge among men, can prolong the\r\nmemorial. But our object is, by this edifice, to show our own deep sense\r\nof the value and importance of the achievements of our ancestors; and,\r\nby presenting this work of gratitude to the eye, to keep alive similar\r\nsentiments, and to foster a constant regard for the principles of the\r\nRevolution. Human beings are composed, not of reason only, but of\r\nimagination also, and sentiment; and that is neither wasted nor\r\nmisapplied which is appropriated to the purpose of giving right\r\ndirection to sentiments, and opening proper springs of feeling in the\r\nheart. Let it not be supposed that our object is to perpetuate national\r\nhostility, or even to cherish a mere military spirit. It is higher,\r\npurer, nobler. We consecrate our work to the spirit of national\r\nindependence, and we wish that the light of peace may rest upon it for\r\never. We rear a memorial of our conviction of that unmeasured benefit\r\nwhich has been conferred on our own land, and of the happy influences\r\nwhich have been produced, by the same events, on the general interests\r\nof mankind. We come, as Americans, to mark a spot which must for ever be\r\ndear to us and our posterity. We wish that whosoever, in all coming\r\ntime, shall turn his eye hither, may behold that the place is not\r\nundistinguished where the first great battle of the Revolution was\r\nfought. We wish that this structure may proclaim the magnitude and\r\nimportance of that event to every class and every age. We wish that\r\ninfancy may learn the purpose of its erection from maternal lips, and\r\nthat weary and withered age may behold it, and be solaced by the\r\nrecollections which it suggests. We wish that labor may look up here,\r\nand be proud, in the midst of its toil. We wish that, in those days of\r\ndisaster, which, as they come upon all nations, must be expected to come\r\nupon us also, desponding patriotism may turn its eyes hitherward, and be\r\nassured that the foundations of our national power are still strong. We\r\nwish that this column, rising towards heaven among the pointed spires of\r\nso many temples dedicated to God, may contribute also to produce, in all\r\nminds, a pious feeling of dependence and gratitude. We wish, finally,\r\nthat the last object to the sight of him who leaves his native shore,\r\nand the first to gladden his who revisits it, may be something which\r\nshall remind him of the liberty and the glory of his country. Let it\r\nrise! let it rise, till it meet the sun in his coming; let the earliest\r\nlight of the morning gild it, and parting day linger and play on its\r\nsummit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe live in a most extraordinary age. Events so various and so important\r\nthat they might crowd and distinguish centuries, are, in our times,\r\ncompressed within the compass of a single life. When has it happened\r\nthat history has had so much to record, in the same term of years, as\r\nsince the 17th of June, 1775? Our own Revolution, which, under other\r\ncircumstances, might itself have been expected to occasion a war of half\r\na century, has been achieved; twenty-four sovereign and independent\r\nStates erected; and a general government established over them, so safe,\r\nso wise, so free, so practical, that we might well wonder its\r\nestablishment should have been accomplished so soon, were it not far the\r\ngreater wonder that it should have been established at all. Two or three\r\nmillions of people have been augmented to twelve, the great forests of\r\nthe West prostrated beneath the arm of successful industry, and the\r\ndwellers on the banks of the Ohio and the Mississippi become the\r\nfellow-citizens and neighbors of those who cultivate the hills of New\r\nEngland.[56] We have a commerce, that leaves no sea unexplored; navies,\r\nwhich take no law from superior force; revenues, adequate to all the\r\nexigencies of government, almost without taxation; and peace with all\r\nnations, founded on equal rights and mutual respect.\r\n\r\nEurope, within the same period, has been agitated by a mighty\r\nrevolution, which, while it has been felt in the individual condition\r\nand happiness of almost every man, has shaken to the centre her\r\npolitical fabric, and dashed against one another thrones which had stood\r\ntranquil for ages. On this, our continent, our own example has been\r\nfollowed, and colonies have sprung up to be nations. Unaccustomed sounds\r\nof liberty and free government have reached us from beyond the track of\r\nthe sun; and at this moment the dominion of European power in this\r\ncontinent, from the place where we stand to the south pole, is\r\nannihilated for ever.[57]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, both in Europe and America, such has been the general\r\nprogress of knowledge, such the improvement in legislation, in\r\ncommerce, in the arts, in letters, and, above all, in liberal ideas and\r\nthe general spirit of the age, that the whole world seems changed.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding that this is but a faint abstract of the things\r\nwhich have happened since the day of the battle of Bunker Hill, we are\r\nbut fifty years removed from it; and we now stand here to enjoy all\r\nthe blessings of our own condition, and to look abroad on the\r\nbrightened prospects of the world, while we still have among us some\r\nof those who were active agents in the scenes of 1775, and who are now\r\nhere, from every quarter of New England, to visit once more, and\r\nunder circumstances so affecting, I had almost said so overwhelming,\r\nthis renowned theatre of their courage and patriotism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVENERABLE MEN! you have come down to us from a former generation. Heaven\r\nhas bounteously lengthened out your lives, that you might behold this\r\njoyous day. You are now where you stood fifty years ago, this very hour,\r\nwith your brothers and your neighbors, shoulder to shoulder, in the\r\nstrife for your country. Behold, how altered! The same heavens are\r\nindeed over your heads; the same ocean rolls at your feet; but all else\r\nhow changed! You hear now no roar of hostile cannon, you see no mixed\r\nvolumes of smoke and flame rising from burning Charlestown. The ground\r\nstrowed with the dead and the dying; the impetuous charge; the steady\r\nand successful repulse; the loud call to repeated assault; the summoning\r\nof all that is manly to repeated resistance; a thousand bosoms freely\r\nand fearlessly bared in an instant to whatever of terror there may be in\r\nwar and death;--all these you have witnessed, but you witness them no\r\nmore. All is peace. The heights of yonder metropolis, its towers and\r\nroofs, which you then saw filled with wives and children and countrymen\r\nin distress and terror, and looking with unutterable emotions for the\r\nissue of the combat, have presented you to-day with the sight of its\r\nwhole happy population, come out to welcome and greet you with a\r\nuniversal jubilee. Yonder proud ships, by a felicity of position\r\nappropriately lying at the foot of this mount, and seeming fondly to\r\ncling around it, are not means of annoyance to you, but your country's\r\nown means of distinction and defence.[58] All is peace; and God has\r\ngranted you this sight of your country's happiness, ere you slumber in\r\nthe grave. He has allowed you to behold and to partake the reward of\r\nyour patriotic toils; and he has allowed us, your sons and countrymen,\r\nto meet you here, and in the name of the present generation, in the name\r\nof your country, in the name of liberty, to thank you!\r\n\r\nBut, alas! you are not all here! Time and the sword have thinned your\r\nranks. Prescott, Putnam, Stark, Brooks, Read, Pomeroy, Bridge! our eyes\r\nseek for you in vain amid this broken band. You are gathered to your\r\nfathers, and live only to your country in her grateful remembrance and\r\nyour own bright example. But let us not too much grieve, that you have\r\nmet the common fate of men. You lived at least long enough to know that\r\nyour work had been nobly and successfully accomplished. You lived to see\r\nyour country's independence established, and to sheathe your swords from\r\nwar. On the light of Liberty you saw arise the light of Peace, like\r\n\r\n      \"another morn,\r\n  Risen on mid-noon\";\r\n\r\nand the sky on which you closed your eyes was cloudless.\r\n\r\nBut ah! Him! the first great martyr in this great cause! Him! the\r\npremature victim of his own self-devoting heart! Him! the head of our\r\ncivil councils, and the destined leader of our military bands, whom\r\nnothing brought hither but the unquenchable fire of his own spirit! Him!\r\ncut off by Providence in the hour of overwhelming anxiety and thick\r\ngloom; falling ere he saw the star of his country rise; pouring out his\r\ngenerous blood like water, before he knew whether it would fertilize a\r\nland of freedom or of bondage!--how shall I struggle with the emotions\r\nthat stifle the utterance of thy name![59] Our poor work may perish; but\r\nthine shall endure! This monument may moulder away; the solid ground it\r\nrests upon may sink down to a level with the sea; but thy memory shall\r\nnot fail! Wheresoever among men a heart shall be found that beats to the\r\ntransports of patriotism and liberty, its aspirations shall be to claim\r\nkindred with thy spirit!\r\n\r\nBut the scene amidst which we stand does not permit us to confine our\r\nthoughts or our sympathies to those fearless spirits who hazarded or\r\nlost their lives on this consecrated spot. We have the happiness to\r\nrejoice here in the presence of a most worthy representation of the\r\nsurvivors of the whole Revolutionary army.\r\n\r\nVETERANS! you are the remnant of many a well-fought field. You bring\r\nwith you marks of honor from Trenton and Monmouth, from Yorktown,\r\nCamden, Bennington, and Saratoga. VETERANS OF HALF A CENTURY! when in\r\nyour youthful days you put every thing at hazard in your country's\r\ncause, good as that cause was, and sanguine as youth is, still your\r\nfondest hopes did not stretch onward to an hour like this! At a period\r\nto which you could not reasonably have expected to arrive, at a moment\r\nof national prosperity such as you could never have foreseen, you are\r\nnow met here to enjoy the fellowship of old soldiers, and to receive the\r\noverflowings of a universal gratitude.\r\n\r\nBut your agitated countenances and your heaving breasts inform me that\r\neven this is not an unmixed joy. I perceive that a tumult of contending\r\nfeelings rushes upon you. The images of the dead, as well as the persons\r\nof the living, present themselves before you. The scene overwhelms you,\r\nand I turn from it. May the Father of all mercies smile upon your\r\ndeclining years, and bless them! And when you shall here have exchanged\r\nyour embraces, when you shall once more have pressed the hands which\r\nhave been so often extended to give succor in adversity, or grasped in\r\nthe exultation of victory, then look abroad upon this lovely land which\r\nyour young valor defended, and mark the happiness with which it is\r\nfilled; yea, look abroad upon the whole earth, and see what a name you\r\nhave contributed to give to your country, and what a praise you have\r\nadded to freedom, and then rejoice in the sympathy and gratitude which\r\nbeam upon your last days from the improved condition of mankind!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe occasion does not require of me any particular account of the battle\r\nof the 17th of June, 1775, nor any detailed narrative of the events\r\nwhich immediately preceded it. These are familiarly known to all. In the\r\nprogress of the great and interesting controversy, Massachusetts and\r\nthe town of Boston had become early and marked objects of the\r\ndispleasure of the British Parliament. This had been manifested in\r\nthe act for altering the government of the Province, and in that for\r\nshutting up the port of Boston. Nothing sheds more honor on our\r\nearly history, and nothing better shows how little the feelings and\r\nsentiments of the Colonies were known or regarded in England, than the\r\nimpression which these measures everywhere produced in America. It had\r\nbeen anticipated, that while the Colonies in general would be terrified\r\nby the severity of the punishment inflicted on Massachusetts, the\r\nother seaports would be governed by a mere spirit of gain; and that,\r\nas Boston was now cut off from all commerce, the unexpected advantage\r\nwhich this blow on her was calculated to confer on other towns would be\r\ngreedily enjoyed. How miserably such reasoners deceived themselves!\r\nHow little they knew of the depth, and the strength, and the\r\nintenseness of that feeling of resistance to illegal acts of power,\r\nwhich possessed the whole American people! Everywhere the unworthy boon\r\nwas rejected with scorn. The fortunate occasion was seized, everywhere,\r\nto show to the whole world that the Colonies were swayed by no local\r\ninterest, no partial interest, no selfish interest. The temptation to\r\nprofit by the punishment of Boston was strongest to our neighbors of\r\nSalem. Yet Salem was precisely the place where this miserable proffer\r\nwas spurned, in a tone of the most lofty self-respect and the most\r\nindignant patriotism. \"We are deeply affected,\" said its inhabitants,\r\n\"with the sense of our public calamities; but the miseries that are\r\nnow rapidly hastening on our brethren in the capital of the Province\r\ngreatly excite our commiseration. By shutting up the port of Boston,\r\nsome imagine that the course of trade might be turned hither and to\r\nour benefit; but we must be dead to every idea of justice, lost to\r\nall feelings of humanity, could we indulge a thought to seize on wealth\r\nand raise our fortunes on the ruin of our suffering neighbors.\" These\r\nnoble sentiments were not confined to our immediate vicinity. In that\r\nday of general affection and brotherhood, the blow given to Boston\r\nsmote on every patriotic heart from one end of the country to the\r\nother. Virginia and the Carolinas, as well as Connecticut and New\r\nHampshire, felt and proclaimed the cause to be their own. The\r\nContinental Congress, then holding its first session in Philadelphia,\r\nexpressed its sympathy for the suffering inhabitants of Boston, and\r\naddresses were received from all quarters, assuring them that the\r\ncause was a common one, and should be met by common efforts and\r\ncommon sacrifices. The Congress of Massachusetts responded to these\r\nassurances; and in an address to the Congress at Philadelphia,\r\nbearing the official signature, perhaps among the last, of the immortal\r\nWarren, notwithstanding the severity of its suffering and the magnitude\r\nof the dangers which threatened it, it was declared, that this Colony\r\n\"is ready, at all times, to spend and to be spent in the cause of\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nBut the hour drew nigh which was to put professions to the proof, and to\r\ndetermine whether the authors of these mutual pledges were ready to seal\r\nthem in blood. The tidings of Lexington and Concord had no sooner\r\nspread, than it was universally felt that the time was at last come for\r\naction. A spirit pervaded all ranks, not transient, not boisterous, but\r\ndeep, solemn, determined,\r\n\r\n                  \"totamque infusa per artus\r\n  Mens agitat molem, et magno se corpore miscet.\"\r\n\r\nWar, on their own soil and at their own doors; was, indeed, a strange\r\nwork to the yeomanry of New England; but their consciences were\r\nconvinced of its necessity, their country called them to it, and they\r\ndid not withhold themselves from the perilous trial. The ordinary\r\noccupations of life were abandoned; the plough was staid in the\r\nunfinished furrow; wives gave up their husbands, and mothers gave up\r\ntheir sons, to the battles of a civil war. Death might come, in honor,\r\non the field; it might come, in disgrace, on the scaffold. For either\r\nand for both they were prepared. The sentiment of Quincy was full in\r\ntheir hearts. \"Blandishments,\" said that distinguished son of genius and\r\npatriotism, \"will not fascinate us, nor will threats of a halter\r\nintimidate; for, under God, we are determined that, wheresoever,\r\nwhensoever, or howsoever we shall be called to make our exit, we will\r\ndie free men.\"\r\n\r\nThe 17th of June saw the four New England Colonies standing here, side\r\nby side, to triumph or to fall together; and there was with them from\r\nthat moment to the end of the war, what I hope will remain with them for\r\never, one cause, one country, one heart.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Bunker Hill was attended with the most important effects\r\nbeyond its immediate results as a military engagement. It created at\r\nonce a state of open, public war. There could now be no longer a\r\nquestion of proceeding against individuals, as guilty of treason or\r\nrebellion. That fearful crisis was past. The appeal lay to the sword,\r\nand the only question was, whether the spirit and the resources of the\r\npeople would hold out, till the object should be accomplished. Nor were\r\nits general consequences confined to our own country. The previous\r\nproceedings of the Colonies, their appeals, resolutions, and addresses,\r\nhad made their cause known to Europe. Without boasting, we may say, that\r\nin no age or country has the public cause been maintained with more\r\nforce of argument, more power of illustration, or more of that\r\npersuasion which excited feeling and elevated principle can alone\r\nbestow, than the Revolutionary state papers exhibit. These papers will\r\nfor ever deserve to be studied, not only for the spirit which they\r\nbreathe, but for the ability with which they were written.\r\n\r\nTo this able vindication of their cause, the Colonies had now added a\r\npractical and severe proof of their own true devotion to it, and given\r\nevidence also of the power which they could bring to its support. All\r\nnow saw, that if America fell, she would not fall without a struggle.\r\nMen felt sympathy and regard, as well as surprise, when they beheld\r\nthese infant states, remote, unknown, unaided, encounter the power of\r\nEngland, and, in the first considerable battle, leave more of their\r\nenemies dead on the field, in proportion to the number of combatants,\r\nthan had been recently known to fall in the wars of Europe.\r\n\r\nInformation of these events, circulating throughout the world, at length\r\nreached the ears of one who now hears me.[60] He has not forgotten the\r\nemotion which the fame of Bunker Hill, and the name of Warren, excited\r\nin his youthful breast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR, we are assembled to commemorate the establishment of great public\r\nprinciples of liberty, and to do honor to the distinguished dead. The\r\noccasion is too severe for eulogy of the living. But, Sir, your\r\ninteresting relation to this country, the peculiar circumstances which\r\nsurround you and surround us, call on me to express the happiness which\r\nwe derive from your presence and aid in this solemn commemoration.\r\n\r\nFortunate, fortunate man! with what measure of devotion will you not\r\nthank God for the circumstances of your extraordinary life! You are\r\nconnected with both hemispheres and with two generations. Heaven saw fit\r\nto ordain, that the electric spark of liberty should be conducted,\r\nthrough you, from the New World to the Old; and we, who are now here to\r\nperform this duty of patriotism, have all of us long ago received it in\r\ncharge from our fathers to cherish your name and your virtues. You will\r\naccount it an instance of your good fortune, Sir, that you crossed the\r\nseas to visit us at a time which enables you to be present at this\r\nsolemnity. You now behold the field, the renown of which reached you in\r\nthe heart of France, and caused a thrill in your ardent bosom. You see\r\nthe lines of the little redoubt thrown up by the incredible diligence of\r\nPrescott; defended, to the last extremity, by his lion-hearted valor;\r\nand within which the corner-stone of our monument has now taken its\r\nposition. You see where Warren fell, and where Parker, Gardner,\r\nMcCleary, Moore, and other early patriots, fell with him. Those who\r\nsurvived that day, and whose lives have been prolonged to the present\r\nhour, are now around you. Some of them you have known in the trying\r\nscenes of the war. Behold! they now stretch forth their feeble arms to\r\nembrace you. Behold! they raise their trembling voices to invoke the\r\nblessing of God on you and yours for ever.\r\n\r\nSir, you have assisted us in laying the foundation of this structure.\r\nYou have heard us rehearse, with our feeble commendation, the names of\r\ndeparted patriots. Monuments and eulogy belong to the dead. We give them\r\nthis day to Warren and his associates. On other occasions they have been\r\ngiven to your more immediate companions in arms, to Washington, to\r\nGreene, to Gates, to Sullivan, and to Lincoln. We have become reluctant\r\nto grant these, our highest and last honors, further. We would gladly\r\nhold them yet back from the little remnant of that immortal band. _Serus\r\nin coelum redeas._ Illustrious as are your merits, yet far, O, very far\r\ndistant be the day, when any inscription shall bear your name, or any\r\ntongue pronounce its eulogy!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe leading reflection to which this occasion seems to invite us,\r\nrespects the great changes which have happened in the fifty years since\r\nthe battle of Bunker Hill was fought. And it peculiarly marks the\r\ncharacter of the present age, that, in looking at these changes, and in\r\nestimating their effect on our condition, we are obliged to consider,\r\nnot what has been done in our own country only, but in others also. In\r\nthese interesting times, while nations are making separate and\r\nindividual advances in improvement, they make, too, a common progress;\r\nlike vessels on a common tide, propelled by the gales at different\r\nrates, according to their several structure and management, but all\r\nmoved forward by one mighty current, strong enough to bear onward\r\nwhatever does not sink beneath it.\r\n\r\nA chief distinction of the present day is a community of opinions and\r\nknowledge amongst men in different nations, existing in a degree\r\nheretofore unknown. Knowledge has, in our time, triumphed, and is\r\ntriumphing, over distance, over difference of languages, over diversity\r\nof habits, over prejudice, and over bigotry. The civilized and Christian\r\nworld is fast learning the great lesson, that difference of nation does\r\nnot imply necessary hostility, and that all contact need not be war. The\r\nwhole world is becoming a common field for intellect to act in. Energy\r\nof mind, genius, power, wheresoever it exists, may speak out in any\r\ntongue, and the _world_ will hear it. A great chord of sentiment and\r\nfeeling runs through two continents, and vibrates over both. Every\r\nbreeze wafts intelligence from country to country; every wave rolls it;\r\nall give it forth, and all in turn receive it. There is a vast commerce\r\nof ideas; there are marts and exchanges for intellectual discoveries,\r\nand a wonderful fellowship of those individual intelligences which make\r\nup the mind and opinion of the age. Mind is the great lever of all\r\nthings; human thought is the process by which human ends are ultimately\r\nanswered; and the diffusion of knowledge, so astonishing in the last\r\nhalf-century, has rendered innumerable minds, variously gifted by\r\nnature, competent to be competitors or fellow-workers on the theatre of\r\nintellectual operation.\r\n\r\nFrom these causes important improvements have taken place in the\r\npersonal condition of individuals. Generally speaking, mankind are not\r\nonly better fed and better clothed, but they are able also to enjoy more\r\nleisure; they possess more refinement and more self-respect. A superior\r\ntone of education, manners, and habits prevails. This remark, most true\r\nin its application to our own country, is also partly true when applied\r\nelsewhere. It is proved by the vastly augmented consumption of those\r\narticles of manufacture and of commerce which contribute to the comforts\r\nand the decencies of life; an augmentation which has far outrun the\r\nprogress of population. And while the unexampled and almost incredible\r\nuse of machinery would seem to supply the place of labor, labor still\r\nfinds its occupation and its reward; so wisely has Providence adjusted\r\nmen's wants and desires to their condition and their capacity.\r\n\r\nAny adequate survey, however, of the progress made during the last\r\nhalf-century in the polite and the mechanic arts, in machinery and\r\nmanufactures, in commerce and agriculture, in letters and in science,\r\nwould require volumes. I must abstain wholly from these subjects, and\r\nturn for a moment to the contemplation of what has been done on the\r\ngreat question of politics and government. This is the master topic of\r\nthe age; and during the whole fifty years it has intensely occupied the\r\nthoughts of men. The nature of civil government, its ends and uses, have\r\nbeen canvassed and investigated; ancient opinions attacked and defended;\r\nnew ideas recommended and resisted, by whatever power the mind of man\r\ncould bring to the controversy. From the closet and the public halls the\r\ndebate has been transferred to the field; and the world has been shaken\r\nby wars of unexampled magnitude, and the greatest variety of fortune. A\r\nday of peace has at length succeeded; and now that the strife has\r\nsubsided, and the smoke cleared away, we may begin to see what has\r\nactually been done, permanently changing the state and condition of\r\nhuman society. And, without dwelling on particular circumstances, it is\r\nmost apparent, that, from the before-mentioned causes of augmented\r\nknowledge and improved individual condition, a real, substantial, and\r\nimportant change has taken place, and is taking place, highly favorable,\r\non the whole, to human liberty and human happiness.\r\n\r\nThe great wheel of political revolution began to move in America. Here\r\nits rotation was guarded, regular, and safe. Transferred to the other\r\ncontinent, from unfortunate but natural causes, it received an irregular\r\nand violent impulse; it whirled along with a fearful celerity; till at\r\nlength, like the chariot-wheels in the races of antiquity, it took fire\r\nfrom the rapidity of its own motion, and blazed onward, spreading\r\nconflagration and terror around.\r\n\r\nWe learn from the result of this experiment, how fortunate was our own\r\ncondition, and how admirably the character of our people was calculated\r\nfor setting the great example of popular governments. The possession of\r\npower did not turn the heads of the American people, for they had long\r\nbeen in the habit of exercising a great degree of self-control. Although\r\nthe paramount authority of the parent state existed over them, yet a\r\nlarge field of legislation had always been open to our Colonial\r\nassemblies. They were accustomed to representative bodies and the forms\r\nof free government; they understood the doctrine of the division of\r\npower among different branches, and the necessity of checks on each. The\r\ncharacter of our countrymen, moreover, was sober, moral, and religious;\r\nand there was little in the change to shock their feelings of justice\r\nand humanity, or even to disturb an honest prejudice. We had no domestic\r\nthrone to overturn, no privileged orders to cast down, no violent\r\nchanges of property to encounter. In the American Revolution, no man\r\nsought or wished for more than to defend and enjoy his own. None hoped\r\nfor plunder or for spoil. Rapacity was unknown to it; the axe was not\r\namong the instruments of its accomplishment; and we all know that it\r\ncould not have lived a single day under any well-founded imputation of\r\npossessing a tendency adverse to the Christian religion.\r\n\r\nIt need not surprise us, that, under circumstances less auspicious,\r\npolitical revolutions elsewhere, even when well intended, have\r\nterminated differently. It is, indeed, a great achievement, it is the\r\nmaster-work of the world, to establish governments entirely popular on\r\nlasting foundations; nor is it easy, indeed, to introduce the popular\r\nprinciple at all into governments to which it has been altogether a\r\nstranger. It cannot be doubted, however, that Europe has come out of the\r\ncontest, in which she has been so long engaged, with greatly superior\r\nknowledge, and, in many respects, in a highly improved condition.\r\nWhatever benefit has been acquired is likely to be retained, for it\r\nconsists mainly in the acquisition of more enlightened ideas. And\r\nalthough kingdoms and provinces may be wrested from the hands that hold\r\nthem, in the same manner they were obtained; although ordinary and\r\nvulgar power may, in human affairs, be lost as it has been won; yet it\r\nis the glorious prerogative of the empire of knowledge, that what it\r\ngains it never loses. On the contrary, it increases by the multiple of\r\nits own power; all its ends become means; all its attainments, helps to\r\nnew conquests. Its whole abundant harvest is but so much seed wheat, and\r\nnothing has limited, and nothing can limit, the amount of ultimate\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of this rapidly increasing knowledge, the people\r\nhave begun, in all forms of government, to think, and to reason, on\r\naffairs of state. Regarding government as an institution for the public\r\ngood, they demand a knowledge of its operations, and a participation in\r\nits exercise. A call for the representative system, wherever it is not\r\nenjoyed, and where there is already intelligence enough to estimate its\r\nvalue, is perseveringly made. Where men may speak out, they demand it;\r\nwhere the bayonet is at their throats, they pray for it.\r\n\r\nWhen Louis the Fourteenth said, \"I am the state,\" he expressed the\r\nessence of the doctrine of unlimited power. By the rules of that system,\r\nthe people are disconnected from the state; they are its subjects; it is\r\ntheir lord. These ideas, founded in the love of power, and long\r\nsupported by the excess and the abuse of it, are yielding, in our age,\r\nto other opinions; and the civilized world seems at last to be\r\nproceeding to the conviction of that fundamental and manifest truth,\r\nthat the powers of government are but a trust, and that they cannot be\r\nlawfully exercised but for the good of the community. As knowledge is\r\nmore and more extended, this conviction becomes more and more general.\r\nKnowledge, in truth, is the great sun in the firmament. Life and power\r\nare scattered with all its beams. The prayer of the Grecian champion,\r\nwhen enveloped in unnatural clouds and darkness, is the appropriate\r\npolitical supplication for the people of every country not yet blessed\r\nwith free institutions:--\r\n\r\n  \"Dispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore,\r\n  Give me TO SEE,--and Ajax asks no more.\"\r\n\r\nWe may hope that the growing influence of enlightened sentiment will\r\npromote the permanent peace of the world. Wars to maintain family\r\nalliances, to uphold or to cast down dynasties, and to regulate\r\nsuccessions to thrones, which have occupied so much room in the history\r\nof modern times, if not less likely to happen at all, will be less\r\nlikely to become general and involve many nations, as the great\r\nprinciple shall be more and more established, that the interest of the\r\nworld is peace, and its first great statute, that every nation possesses\r\nthe power of establishing a government for itself. But public opinion\r\nhas attained also an influence over governments which do not admit the\r\npopular principle into their organization. A necessary respect for the\r\njudgment of the world operates, in some measure, as a control over the\r\nmost unlimited forms of authority. It is owing, perhaps, to this truth,\r\nthat the interesting struggle of the Greeks has been suffered to go on\r\nso long, without a direct interference, either to wrest that country\r\nfrom its present masters, or to execute the system of pacification by\r\nforce, and, with united strength, lay the neck of Christian and\r\ncivilized Greek at the foot of the barbarian Turk. Let us thank God that\r\nwe live in an age when something has influence besides the bayonet, and\r\nwhen the sternest authority does not venture to encounter the scorching\r\npower of public reproach. Any attempt of the kind I have mentioned\r\nshould be met by one universal burst of indignation; the air of the\r\ncivilized world ought to be made too warm to be comfortably breathed by\r\nany one who would hazard it.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, a touching reflection, that, while, in the fulness of our\r\ncountry's happiness, we rear this monument to her honor, we look for\r\ninstruction in our undertaking to a country which is now in fearful\r\ncontest, not for works of art or memorials of glory, but for her own\r\nexistence. Let her be assured, that she is not forgotten in the world;\r\nthat her efforts are applauded, and that constant prayers ascend for her\r\nsuccess. And let us cherish a confident hope for her final triumph. If\r\nthe true spark of religious and civil liberty be kindled, it will burn.\r\nHuman agency cannot extinguish it. Like the earth's central fire, it may\r\nbe smothered for a time; the ocean may overwhelm it; mountains may press\r\nit down; but its inherent and unconquerable force will heave both the\r\nocean and the land, and at some time or other, in some place or other,\r\nthe volcano will break out and flame up to heaven.\r\n\r\nAmong the great events of the half-century, we must reckon, certainly,\r\nthe revolution of South America; and we are not likely to overrate the\r\nimportance of that revolution, either to the people of the country\r\nitself or to the rest of the world. The late Spanish colonies, now\r\nindependent states, under circumstances less favorable, doubtless, than\r\nattended our own revolution, have yet successfully commenced their\r\nnational existence. They have accomplished the great object of\r\nestablishing their independence; they are known and acknowledged in the\r\nworld; and although in regard to their systems of government, their\r\nsentiments on religious toleration, and their provisions for public\r\ninstruction, they may have yet much to learn, it must be admitted that\r\nthey have risen to the condition of settled and established states more\r\nrapidly than could have been reasonably anticipated. They already\r\nfurnish an exhilarating example of the difference between free\r\ngovernments and despotic misrule. Their commerce, at this moment,\r\ncreates a new activity in all the great marts of the world. They show\r\nthemselves able, by an exchange of commodities, to bear a useful part in\r\nthe intercourse of nations.\r\n\r\n A new spirit of enterprise and industry begins to prevail; all the\r\ngreat interests of society receive a salutary impulse; and the progress\r\nof information not only testifies to an improved condition, but itself\r\nconstitutes the highest and most essential improvement.\r\n\r\nWhen the battle of Bunker Hill was fought, the existence of South\r\nAmerica was scarcely felt in the civilized world. The thirteen little\r\nColonies of North America habitually called themselves the \"Continent.\"\r\nBorne down by colonial subjugation, monopoly, and bigotry, these vast\r\nregions of the South were hardly visible above the horizon. But in our\r\nday there has been, as it were, a new creation. The southern hemisphere\r\nemerges from the sea. Its lofty mountains begin to lift themselves into\r\nthe light of heaven; its broad and fertile plains stretch out, in\r\nbeauty, to the eye of civilized man, and at the mighty bidding of the\r\nvoice of political liberty the waters of darkness retire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd, now, let us indulge an honest exultation in the conviction of the\r\nbenefit which the example of our country has produced, and is likely to\r\nproduce, on human freedom and human happiness. Let us endeavor to\r\ncomprehend in all its magnitude, and to feel in all its importance, the\r\npart assigned to us in the great drama of human affairs. We are placed\r\nat the head of the system of representative and popular governments.\r\nThus far our example shows that such governments are compatible, not\r\nonly with respectability and power, but with repose, with peace, with\r\nsecurity of personal rights, with good laws, and a just administration.\r\n\r\nWe are not propagandists. Wherever other systems are preferred, either\r\nas being thought better in themselves, or as better suited to existing\r\ncondition, we leave the preference to be enjoyed. Our history hitherto\r\nproves, however, that the popular form is practicable, and that with\r\nwisdom and knowledge men may govern themselves; and the duty incumbent\r\non us is, to preserve the consistency of this cheering example, and take\r\ncare that nothing may weaken its authority with the world. If, in our\r\ncase, the representative system ultimately fail, popular governments\r\nmust be pronounced impossible. No combination of circumstances more\r\nfavorable to the experiment can ever be expected to occur. The last\r\nhopes of mankind, therefore, rest with us; and if it should be\r\nproclaimed, that our example had become an argument against the\r\nexperiment, the knell of popular liberty would be sounded throughout the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThese are excitements to duty; but they are not suggestions of doubt.\r\nOur history and our condition, all that is gone before us, and all that\r\nsurrounds us, authorize the belief, that popular governments, though\r\nsubject to occasional variations, in form perhaps not always for the\r\nbetter, may yet, in their general character, be as durable and permanent\r\nas other systems. We know, indeed, that in our country any other is\r\nimpossible. The _principle_ of free governments adheres to the American\r\nsoil. It is bedded in it, immovable as its mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd let the sacred obligations which have devolved on this generation,\r\nand on us, sink deep into our hearts. Those who established our liberty\r\nand our government are daily dropping from among us. The great trust now\r\ndescends to new hands. Let us apply ourselves to that which is presented\r\nto us, as our appropriate object. We can win no laurels in a war for\r\nindependence. Earlier and worthier hands have gathered them all. Nor are\r\nthere places for us by the side of Solon, and Alfred, and other founders\r\nof states. Our fathers have filled them. But there remains to us a\r\ngreat duty of defence and preservation; and there is opened to us, also,\r\na noble pursuit, to which the spirit of the times strongly invites us.\r\nOur proper business is improvement. Let our age be the age of\r\nimprovement. In a day of peace, let us advance the arts of peace and the\r\nworks of peace. Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its\r\npowers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and\r\nsee whether we also, in our day and generation, may not perform\r\nsomething worthy to be remembered. Let us cultivate a true spirit of\r\nunion and harmony. In pursuing the great objects which our condition\r\npoints out to us, let us act under a settled conviction, and an habitual\r\nfeeling, that these twenty-four States are one country. Let our\r\nconceptions be enlarged to the circle of our duties. Let us extend our\r\nideas over the whole of the vast field in which we are called to act.\r\nLet our object be, OUR COUNTRY, OUR WHOLE COUNTRY, AND NOTHING BUT OUR\r\nCOUNTRY. And, by the blessing of God, may that country itself become a\r\nvast and splendid monument, not of oppression and terror, but of Wisdom,\r\nof Peace, and of Liberty, upon which the world may gaze with admiration\r\nfor ever!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [53] An Address delivered at the Laying of the Corner-stone of the\r\n        Bunker Hill Monument at Charlestown, Massachusetts, on the 17th\r\n        of June, 1825.\r\n\r\n   [54] An interesting account of the voyage of the early emigrants to the\r\n        Maryland Colony, and of its settlement, is given in the official\r\n        report of Father White, written probably within the first month\r\n        after the landing at St. Mary's. The original Latin manuscript\r\n        is still preserved among the archives of the Jesuits, at Rome.\r\n        The \"Ark\" and the \"Dove\" are remembered with scarcely less\r\n        interest by the descendants of the sister Colony, than is the\r\n        \"Mayflower\" in New England, which, thirteen years earlier, at\r\n        the same season of the year, bore thither the Pilgrim Fathers.\r\n\r\n   [55] Mr. Webster was at this time President of the Bunker Hill Monument\r\n        Association, chosen on the decease of Governor John Brooks, the\r\n        first President.\r\n\r\n   [56] That which was spoken of figuratively in 1825 has, in the lapse of\r\n        a quarter of a century, by the introduction of railroads and\r\n        telegraphic lines, become a reality. It is an interesting\r\n        circumstance, that the first railroad on the Western Continent\r\n        was constructed for the purpose of accelerating the erection of\r\n        this monument.\r\n\r\n   [57] See President Monroe's Message to Congress in 1823, and Mr.\r\n        Webster's speech on the Panama mission, in 1828.\r\n\r\n   [58] It is necessary to inform those only who are unacquainted with the\r\n        localities, that the United States Navy Yard at Charlestown is\r\n        situated at the base of Bunker Hill.\r\n\r\n   [59] See the North American Review, Vol. XLI. p. 242.\r\n\r\n   [60] Among the earliest of the arrangements for the celebration of the\r\n        17th of June, 1825, was the invitation to General Lafayette to\r\n        be present; and he had so timed his progress through the other\r\n        States as to return to Massachusetts in season for the great\r\n        occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMPLETION OF THE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE.*\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the introductory note to the preceding Address, a brief account is\r\ngiven of the origin and progress of the measures adopted for the\r\nerection of the Bunker Hill Monument, down to the time of laying the\r\ncorner-stone, compiled from Mr. Frothingham's History of the Siege of\r\nBoston. The same valuable work (pp. 345-352) relates the obstacles\r\nwhich presented themselves to the rapid execution of the design, and\r\nthe means by which they were overcome. In this narrative, Mr.\r\nFrothingham has done justice to the efforts and exertions of the\r\nsuccessive boards of direction and officers of the Association, to the\r\nskill and disinterestedness of the architect, to the liberality of\r\ndistinguished individuals, to the public spirit of the Massachusetts\r\nCharitable Mechanic Association, in promoting a renewed subscription,\r\nand to the patriotic zeal of the ladies of Boston and the vicinity,\r\nin holding a most successful fair. As it would be difficult farther\r\nto condense the information contained in this interesting summary, we\r\nmust refer the reader to Mr. Frothingham's work for an adequate account\r\nof the causes which delayed the completion of the monument for nearly\r\nseventeen years, and of the resources and exertions by which the\r\ndesired end was finally attained. The last stone was raised to its\r\nplace on the morning of the 23d of July, 1842.\r\n\r\nIt was determined by the directors of the Association, that the\r\ncompletion of the work should be celebrated in a manner not less\r\nimposing than that in which the laying of the corner-stone had been\r\ncelebrated, seventeen years before. The cooeperation of Mr. Webster was\r\nagain invited, and, notwithstanding the pressure of his engagements as\r\nSecretary of State at Washington, was again patriotically yielded. Many\r\ncircumstances conspired to increase the interest of the occasion. The\r\ncompletion of the monument had been long delayed, but in the interval\r\nthe subject had been kept much before the public mind. Mr. Webster's\r\naddress on the 17th of June, 1825, had obtained the widest circulation\r\nthroughout the country; passages from it had passed into household words\r\nthroughout the Union. Wherever they were repeated, they made the Bunker\r\nHill Monument a familiar thought with the people. Meantime, Boston and\r\nCharlestown had doubled their population, and the multiplication of\r\nrailroads in every direction enabled a person, in almost any part of New\r\nEngland, to reach the metropolis in a day. The President of the United\r\nStates and his Cabinet had accepted invitations to be present;\r\ndelegations of the descendants of New England were present from the\r\nremotest parts of the Union; one hundred and eight surviving veterans of\r\nthe Revolution, among whom were some who were in the battle of Bunker\r\nHill, imparted a touching interest to the scene.\r\n\r\nEvery thing conspired to promote the success of the ceremonial. The day\r\nwas uncommonly fine; cool for the season, and clear. A large volunteer\r\nforce from various parts of the country had assembled for the occasion,\r\nand formed a brilliant escort to an immense procession, as it moved from\r\nBoston to the battle-ground on the hill. The bank which slopes down from\r\nthe obelisk on the eastern side of Monument Square was covered with\r\nseats, rising in the form of an amphitheatre, under the open sky. These\r\nhad been prepared for ladies, who had assembled in great numbers,\r\nawaiting the arrival of the procession. When it arrived, it was received\r\ninto a large open area in front of these seats. Mr. Webster was\r\nstationed upon an elevated platform, in front of the audience and of the\r\nmonument towering in the background. According to Mr. Frothingham's\r\nestimate, a hundred thousand persons were gathered about the spot, and\r\nnearly half that number are supposed to have been within the reach of\r\nthe orator's voice. The ground rises slightly between the platform and\r\nthe Monument Square, so that the whole of this immense concourse,\r\ncompactly crowded together, breathless with attention, swayed by one\r\nsentiment of admiration and delight, was within the full view of the\r\nspeaker. The position and the occasion were the height of the moral\r\nsublime. \"When, after saying, 'It is not from my lips, it could not be\r\nfrom any human lips, that that strain of eloquence is this day to flow\r\nmost competent to move and excite the vast multitude around me,--the\r\npowerful speaker stands motionless before us,' he paused, and pointed in\r\nsilent admiration to the sublime structure, the audience burst into long\r\nand loud applause. It was some moments before the speaker could go on\r\nwith the address.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMPLETION OF THE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT.[61]\r\n\r\n\r\nA duty has been performed. A work of gratitude and patriotism is\r\ncompleted. This structure, having its foundations in soil which drank\r\ndeep of early Revolutionary blood, has at length reached its destined\r\nheight, and now lifts its summit to the skies.\r\n\r\nWe have assembled to celebrate the accomplishment of this undertaking,\r\nand to indulge afresh in the recollection of the great event which it is\r\ndesigned to commemorate. Eighteen years, more than half the ordinary\r\nduration of a generation of mankind, have elapsed since the cornerstone\r\nof this monument was laid. The hopes of its projectors rested on\r\nvoluntary contributions, private munificence, and the general favor of\r\nthe public. These hopes have not been disappointed. Donations have been\r\nmade by individuals, in some cases of large amount, and smaller sums\r\nhave been contributed by thousands. All who regard the object itself as\r\nimportant, and its accomplishment, therefore, as a good attained, will\r\nentertain sincere respect and gratitude for the unwearied efforts of the\r\nsuccessive presidents, boards of directors, and committees of the\r\nAssociation which has had the general control of the work. The\r\narchitect, equally entitled to our thanks and commendation, will find\r\nother reward, also, for his labor and skill, in the beauty and elegance\r\nof the obelisk itself, and the distinction which, as a work of art, it\r\nconfers upon him.\r\n\r\nAt a period when the prospects of further progress in the undertaking\r\nwere gloomy and discouraging, the Mechanic Association, by a most\r\npraiseworthy and vigorous effort, raised new funds for carrying it\r\nforward, and saw them applied with fidelity, economy, and skill. It is a\r\ngrateful duty to make public acknowledgments of such timely and\r\nefficient aid.\r\n\r\nThe last effort and the last contribution were from a different source.\r\nGarlands of grace and elegance were destined to crown a work which had\r\nits commencement in manly patriotism. The winning power of the sex\r\naddressed itself to the public, and all that was needed to carry the\r\nmonument to its proposed height, and to give to it its finish, was\r\npromptly supplied. The mothers and the daughters of the land contributed\r\nthus, most successfully, to whatever there is of beauty in the monument\r\nitself, or whatever of utility and public benefit and gratification\r\nthere is in its completion.\r\n\r\nOf those with whom the plan originated of erecting on this spot a\r\nmonument worthy of the event to be commemorated, many are now present;\r\nbut others, alas! have themselves become subjects of monumental\r\ninscription. William Tudor, an accomplished scholar, a distinguished\r\nwriter, a most amiable man, allied both by birth and sentiment to the\r\npatriots of the Revolution, died while on public service abroad, and now\r\nlies buried in a foreign land.[62] William Sullivan, a name fragrant of\r\nRevolutionary merit, and of public service and public virtue, who\r\nhimself partook in a high degree of the respect and confidence of the\r\ncommunity, and yet was always most loved where best known, has also been\r\ngathered to his fathers.[63] And last, George Blake, a lawyer of\r\nlearning and eloquence, a man of wit and of talent, of social qualities\r\nthe most agreeable and fascinating, and of gifts which enabled him to\r\nexercise large sway over public assemblies, has closed his human\r\ncareer.[63] I know that in the crowds before me there are those from\r\nwhose eyes tears will flow at the mention of these names. But such\r\nmention is due to their general character, their public and private\r\nvirtues, and especially, on this occasion, to the spirit and zeal with\r\nwhich they entered into the undertaking which is now completed.\r\n\r\nI have spoken only of those who are no longer numbered with the living.\r\nBut a long life, now drawing towards its close, always distinguished by\r\nacts of public spirit, humanity, and charity, forming a character which\r\nhas already become historical, and sanctified by public regard and the\r\naffection of friends, may confer even on the living the proper immunity\r\nof the dead, and be the fit subject of honorable mention and warm\r\ncommendation. Of the early projectors of the design of this monument,\r\none of the most prominent, the most zealous, and the most efficient, is\r\nThomas H. Perkins. It was beneath his ever-hospitable roof that those\r\nwhom I have mentioned, and others yet living and now present, having\r\nassembled for the purpose, adopted the first step towards erecting a\r\nmonument on Bunker Hill. Long may he remain, with unimpaired faculties,\r\nin the wide field of his usefulness! His charities have distilled, like\r\nthe dews of heaven; he has fed the hungry, and clothed the naked; he has\r\ngiven sight to the blind; and for such virtues there is a reward on\r\nhigh, of which all human memorials, all language of brass and stone, are\r\nbut humble types and attempted imitations.\r\n\r\nTime and nature have had their course, in diminishing the number of\r\nthose whom we met here on the 17th of June, 1825. Most of the\r\nRevolutionary characters then present have since deceased; and Lafayette\r\nsleeps in his native land. Yet the name and blood of Warren are with us;\r\nthe kindred of Putnam are also here; and near me, universally beloved\r\nfor his character and his virtues, and now venerable for his years, sits\r\nthe son of the noble-hearted and daring Prescott.[64] Gideon Foster of\r\nDanvers, Enos Reynolds of Boxford, Phineas Johnson, Robert Andrews,\r\nElijah Dresser, Josiah Cleaveland, Jesse Smith, Philip Bagley, Needham\r\nMaynard, Roger Plaisted, Joseph Stephens, Nehemiah Porter, and James\r\nHarvey, who bore arms for their country either at Concord and Lexington,\r\non the 19th of April, or on Bunker Hill, all now far advanced in age,\r\nhave come here to-day, to look once more on the field where their valor\r\nwas proved, and to receive a hearty outpouring of our respect.\r\n\r\nThey have long outlived the troubles and dangers of the Revolution;\r\nthey have outlived the evils arising from the want of a united and\r\nefficient government; they have outlived the menace of imminent\r\ndangers to the public liberty; they have outlived nearly all their\r\ncontemporaries; but they have not outlived, they cannot outlive, the\r\naffectionate gratitude of their country. Heaven has not allotted to this\r\ngeneration an opportunity of rendering high services, and manifesting\r\nstrong personal devotion, such as they rendered and manifested, and\r\nin such a cause as that which roused the patriotic fires of their\r\nyouthful breasts, and nerved the strength of their arms. But we may\r\npraise what we cannot equal, and celebrate actions which we were not\r\nborn to perform. _Pulchrum est benefacere reipublicae, etiam bene\r\ndicere haud absurdum est._\r\n\r\nThe Bunker Hill Monument is finished. Here it stands. Fortunate in the\r\nhigh natural eminence on which it is placed, higher, infinitely higher\r\nin its objects and purpose, it rises over the land and over the sea;\r\nand, visible, at their homes, to three hundred thousand of the people of\r\nMassachusetts, it stands a memorial of the last, and a monitor to the\r\npresent and to all succeeding generations. I have spoken of the\r\nloftiness of its purpose. If it had been without any other design than\r\nthe creation of a work of art, the granite of which it is composed would\r\nhave slept in its native bed. It has a purpose, and that purpose gives\r\nit its character. That purpose enrobes it with dignity and moral\r\ngrandeur. That well-known purpose it is which causes us to look up to it\r\nwith a feeling of awe. It is itself the orator of this occasion. It is\r\nnot from my lips, it could not be from any human lips, that that strain\r\nof eloquence is this day to flow most competent to move and excite the\r\nvast multitudes around me. The powerful speaker stands motionless before\r\nus. It is a plain shaft. It bears no inscriptions, fronting to the\r\nrising sun, from which the future antiquary shall wipe the dust. Nor\r\ndoes the rising sun cause tones of music to issue from its summit. But\r\nat the rising of the sun, and at the setting of the sun; in the blaze of\r\nnoonday, and beneath the milder effulgence of lunar light; it looks, it\r\nspeaks, it acts, to the full comprehension of every American mind, and\r\nthe awakening of glowing enthusiasm in every American heart. Its silent,\r\nbut awful utterance; its deep pathos, as it brings to our contemplation\r\nthe 17th of June, 1775, and the consequences which have resulted to us,\r\nto our country, and to the world, from the events of that day, and which\r\nwe know must continue to rain influence on the destinies of mankind to\r\nthe end of time; the elevation with which it raises us high above the\r\nordinary feelings of life, surpass all that the study of the closet, or\r\neven the inspiration of genius, can produce. To-day it speaks to us. Its\r\nfuture auditories will be the successive generations of men, as they\r\nrise up before it and gather around it. Its speech will be of patriotism\r\nand courage; of civil and religious liberty; of free government; of the\r\nmoral improvement and elevation of mankind; and of the immortal memory\r\nof those who, with heroic devotion, have sacrificed their lives for\r\ntheir country.[65]\r\n\r\nIn the older world, numerous fabrics still exist, reared by human hands,\r\nbut whose object has been lost in the darkness of ages. They are now\r\nmonuments of nothing but the labor and skill which constructed them.\r\n\r\nThe mighty pyramid itself, half buried in the sands of Africa, has\r\nnothing to bring down and report to us, but the power of kings and\r\nthe servitude of the people. If it had any purpose beyond that of a\r\nmausoleum, such purpose has perished from history and from tradition. If\r\nasked for its moral object, its admonition, its sentiment, its\r\ninstruction to mankind, or any high end in its erection, it is\r\nsilent; silent as the millions which lie in the dust at its base,\r\nand in the catacombs which surround it. Without a just moral object,\r\ntherefore, made known to man, though raised against the skies, it\r\nexcites only conviction of power, mixed with strange wonder. But if the\r\ncivilization of the present race of men, founded, as it is, in solid\r\nscience, the true knowledge of nature, and vast discoveries in art,\r\nand which is elevated and purified by moral sentiment and by the\r\ntruths of Christianity, be not destined to destruction before the final\r\ntermination of human existence on earth, the object and purpose of\r\nthis edifice will be known till that hour shall come. And even if\r\ncivilization should be subverted, and the truths of the Christian\r\nreligion obscured by a new deluge of barbarism, the memory of Bunker\r\nHill and the American Revolution will still be elements and parts of the\r\nknowledge which shall be possessed by the last man to whom the light of\r\ncivilization and Christianity shall be extended.\r\n\r\nThis celebration is honored by the presence of the chief executive\r\nmagistrate of the Union. An occasion so national in its object and\r\ncharacter, and so much connected with that Revolution from which the\r\ngovernment sprang at the head of which he is placed, may well receive\r\nfrom him this mark of attention and respect. Well acquainted with\r\nYorktown, the scene of the last great military struggle of the\r\nRevolution, his eye now surveys the field of Bunker Hill, the theatre of\r\nthe first of those important conflicts. He sees where Warren fell, where\r\nPutnam, and Prescott, and Stark, and Knowlton, and Brooks fought. He\r\nbeholds the spot where a thousand trained soldiers of England were\r\nsmitten to the earth, in the first effort of revolutionary war, by the\r\narm of a bold and determined yeomanry, contending for liberty and their\r\ncountry. And while all assembled here entertain towards him sincere\r\npersonal good wishes and the high respect due to his elevated office and\r\nstation, it is not to be doubted that he enters, with true American\r\nfeeling, into the patriotic enthusiasm kindled by the occasion which\r\nanimates the multitudes that surround him.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency, the Governor of the Commonwealth, the Governor of Rhode\r\nIsland, and the other distinguished public men whom we have the honor to\r\nreceive as visitors and guests to-day, will cordially unite in a\r\ncelebration connected with the great event of the Revolutionary war.\r\n\r\nNo name in the history of 1775 and 1776 is more distinguished than that\r\nborne by an ex-president of the United States, whom we expected to see\r\nhere, but whose ill health prevents his attendance. Whenever popular\r\nrights were to be asserted, an Adams was present; and when the time came\r\nfor the formal Declaration of Independence, it was the voice of an Adams\r\nthat shook the halls of Congress. We wish we could have welcomed to us\r\nthis day the inheritor of Revolutionary blood, and the just and worthy\r\nrepresentative of high Revolutionary names, merit, and services.\r\n\r\nBanners and badges, processions and flags, announce to us, that amidst\r\nthis uncounted throng are thousands of natives of New England now\r\nresidents in other States. Welcome, ye kindred names, with kindred\r\nblood! From the broad savannas of the South, from the newer regions of\r\nthe West, from amidst the hundreds of thousands of men of Eastern origin\r\nwho cultivate the rich valley of the Genesee or live along the chain of\r\nthe Lakes, from the mountains of Pennsylvania, and from the thronged\r\ncities of the coast, welcome, welcome! Wherever else you may be\r\nstrangers, here you are all at home. You assemble at this shrine of\r\nliberty, near the family altars at which your earliest devotions were\r\npaid to Heaven; near to the temples of worship first entered by you, and\r\nnear to the schools and colleges in which your education was received.\r\nYou come hither with a glorious ancestry of liberty. You bring names\r\nwhich are on the rolls of Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill. You come,\r\nsome of you, once more to be embraced by an aged Revolutionary father,\r\nor to receive another, perhaps a last, blessing, bestowed in love and\r\ntears, by a mother, yet surviving to witness and to enjoy your\r\nprosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\nBut if family associations and the recollections of the past bring you\r\nhither with greater alacrity, and mingle with your greeting much of\r\nlocal attachment and private affection, greeting also be given, free and\r\nhearty greeting, to every American citizen who treads this sacred soil\r\nwith patriotic feeling, and respires with pleasure in an atmosphere\r\nperfumed with the recollections of 1775! This occasion is respectable,\r\nnay, it is grand, it is sublime, by the nationality of its sentiment.\r\nAmong the seventeen millions of happy people who form the American\r\ncommunity, there is not one who has not an interest in this monument, as\r\nthere is not one that has not a deep and abiding interest in that which\r\nit commemorates.\r\n\r\nWoe betide the man who brings to this day's worship feeling less than\r\nwholly American! Woe betide the man who can stand here with the fires of\r\nlocal resentments burning, or the purpose of fomenting local jealousies\r\nand the strifes of local interests festering and rankling in his heart.\r\nUnion, established in justice, in patriotism, and the most plain and\r\nobvious common interest,--union, founded on the same love of liberty,\r\ncemented by blood shed in the same common cause,--union has been the\r\nsource of all our glory and greatness thus far, and is the ground of all\r\nour highest hopes. This column stands on Union. I know not that it might\r\nnot keep its position, if the American Union, in the mad conflict of\r\nhuman passions, and in the strife of parties and factions, should be\r\nbroken up and destroyed. I know not that it would totter and fall to the\r\nearth, and mingle its fragments with the fragments of Liberty and the\r\nConstitution, when State should be separated from State, and faction and\r\ndismemberment obliterate for ever all the hopes of the founders of our\r\nrepublic, and the great inheritance of their children. It might stand.\r\nBut who, from beneath the weight of mortification and shame that would\r\noppress him, could look up to behold it? Whose eyeballs would not be\r\nseared by such a spectacle? For my part, should I live to such a time, I\r\nshall avert my eyes from it for ever.\r\n\r\nIt is not as a mere military encounter of hostile armies, that the\r\nbattle of Bunker Hill presents its principal claim to attention. Yet,\r\neven as a mere battle, there were circumstances attending it\r\nextraordinary in character, and entitling it to peculiar distinction. It\r\nwas fought on this eminence; in the neighborhood of yonder city; in the\r\npresence of many more spectators than there were combatants in the\r\nconflict. Men, women, and children, from every commanding position, were\r\ngazing at the battle, and looking for its results with all the eagerness\r\nnatural to those who knew that the issue was fraught with the deepest\r\nconsequences to themselves, personally, as well as to their country.\r\nYet, on the 16th of June, 1775, there was nothing around this hill but\r\nverdure and culture. There was, indeed, the note of awful preparation in\r\nBoston. There was the Provincial army at Cambridge, with its right flank\r\nresting on Dorchester, and its left on Chelsea. But here all was peace.\r\nTranquillity reigned around. On the 17th every thing was changed. On\r\nthis eminence had arisen, in the night, a redoubt, built by Prescott,\r\nand in which he held command. Perceived by the enemy at dawn, it was\r\nimmediately cannonaded from the floating batteries in the river, and\r\nfrom the opposite shore. And then ensued the hurried movement in Boston,\r\nand soon the troops of Britain embarked in the attempt to dislodge the\r\nColonists. In an hour every thing indicated an immediate and bloody\r\nconflict. Love of liberty on one side, proud defiance of rebellion on\r\nthe other; hopes and fears, and courage and daring, on both sides,\r\nanimated the hearts of the combatants as they hung on the edge of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nI suppose it would be difficult, in a military point of view, to ascribe\r\nto the leaders on either side any just motive for the engagement which\r\nfollowed. On the one hand, it could not have been very important to the\r\nAmericans to attempt to hem the British within the town, by advancing\r\none single post a quarter of a mile; while, on the other hand, if the\r\nBritish found it essential to dislodge the American troops, they had it\r\nin their power at no expense of life. By moving up their ships and\r\nbatteries, they could have completely cut off all communication with the\r\nmainland over the Neck, and the forces in the redoubt would have been\r\nreduced to a state of famine in forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\nBut that was not the day for any such consideration on either side! Both\r\nparties were anxious to try the strength of their arms. The pride of\r\nEngland would not permit the rebels, as she termed them, to defy her to\r\nthe teeth; and, without for a moment calculating the cost, the British\r\ngeneral determined to destroy the fort immediately. On the other side,\r\nPrescott and his gallant followers longed and thirsted for a decisive\r\ntrial of strength and of courage. They wished a battle, and wished it at\r\nonce. And this is the true secret of the movements on this hill.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to describe that battle. The cannonading; the landing\r\nof the British; their advance; the coolness with which the charge was\r\nmet; the repulse; the second attack; the second repulse; the burning of\r\nCharlestown; and, finally, the closing assault, and the slow retreat of\r\nthe Americans,--the history of all these is familiar.\r\n\r\nBut the consequences of the battle of Bunker Hill were greater than\r\nthose of any ordinary conflict, although between armies of far greater\r\nforce, and terminating with more immediate advantage on the one side or\r\nthe other. It was the first great battle of the Revolution; and not only\r\nthe first blow, but the blow which determined the contest. It did not,\r\nindeed, put an end to the war, but in the then existing hostile state of\r\nfeeling, the difficulties could only be referred to the arbitration of\r\nthe sword. And one thing is certain; that after the New England troops\r\nhad shown themselves able to face and repulse the regulars, it was\r\ndecided that peace never could be established, but upon the basis of the\r\nindependence of the Colonies. When the sun of that day went down, the\r\nevent of Independence was no longer doubtful. In a few days Washington\r\nheard of the battle, and he inquired if the militia had stood the fire\r\nof the regulars. When told that they had not only stood that fire, but\r\nreserved their own till the enemy was within eight rods, and then\r\npoured it in with tremendous effect, \"Then,\" exclaimed he, \"the\r\nliberties of the country are safe!\"\r\n\r\nThe consequences of this battle were just of the same importance as the\r\nRevolution itself.\r\n\r\nIf there was nothing of value in the principles of the American\r\nRevolution, then there is nothing valuable in the battle of Bunker Hill\r\nand its consequences. But if the Revolution was an era in the history of\r\nman favorable to human happiness, if it was an event which marked the\r\nprogress of man all over the world from despotism to liberty, then this\r\nmonument is not raised without cause. Then the battle of Bunker Hill is\r\nnot an event undeserving celebrations, commemorations, and rejoicings,\r\nnow and in all coming times.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the true and peculiar principle of the American\r\nRevolution, and of the systems of government which it has confirmed and\r\nestablished? The truth is, that the American Revolution was not caused\r\nby the instantaneous discovery of principles of government before\r\nunheard of, or the practical adoption of political ideas such as had\r\nnever before entered into the minds of men. It was but the full\r\ndevelopment of principles of government, forms of society, and political\r\nsentiments, the origin of all which lay back two centuries in English\r\nand American history.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America, its colonization by the nations of Europe,\r\nthe history and progress of the colonies, from their establishment to\r\nthe time when the principal of them threw off their allegiance to the\r\nrespective states by which they had been planted, and founded\r\ngovernments of their own, constitute one of the most interesting\r\nportions of the annals of man. These events occupied three hundred\r\nyears; during which period civilization and knowledge made steady\r\nprogress in the Old World; so that Europe, at the commencement of\r\nthe nineteenth century, had become greatly changed from that Europe\r\nwhich began the colonization of America at the close of the fifteenth,\r\nor the commencement of the sixteenth. And what is most material to my\r\npresent purpose is, that in the progress of the first of these\r\ncenturies, that is to say, from the discovery of America to the\r\nsettlements of Virginia and Massachusetts, political and religious\r\nevents took place, which most materially affected the state of\r\nsociety and the sentiments of mankind, especially in England and in\r\nparts of Continental Europe. After a few feeble and unsuccessful\r\nefforts by England, under Henry the Seventh, to plant colonies in\r\nAmerica, no designs of that kind were prosecuted for a long period,\r\neither by the English government or any of its subjects. Without\r\ninquiring into the causes of this delay, its consequences are\r\nsufficiently clear and striking. England, in this lapse of a century,\r\nunknown to herself, but under the providence of God and the influence of\r\nevents, was fitting herself for the work of colonizing North America,\r\non such principles and by such men, as should spread the English\r\nname and English blood, in time, over a great portion of the Western\r\nhemisphere. The commercial spirit was greatly fostered by several laws\r\npassed in the reign of Henry the Seventh; and in the same reign\r\nencouragement was given to arts and manufactures in the eastern\r\ncounties, and some not unimportant modifications of the feudal system\r\ntook place, by allowing the breaking of entails. These and other\r\nmeasures, and other occurrences, were making way for a new class of\r\nsociety to emerge, and show itself, in a military and feudal age; a\r\nmiddle class, between the barons or great landholders and the retainers\r\nof the crown, on the one side, and the tenants of the crown and barons,\r\nand agricultural and other laborers, on the other side. With the rise\r\nand growth of this new class of society, not only did commerce and the\r\narts increase, but better education, a greater degree of knowledge,\r\njuster notions of the true ends of government, and sentiments\r\nfavorable to civil liberty, began to spread abroad, and become more\r\nand more common. But the plants springing from these seeds were of slow\r\ngrowth. The character of English society had indeed begun to undergo a\r\nchange; but changes of national character are ordinarily the work of\r\ntime. Operative causes were, however, evidently in existence, and sure\r\nto produce, ultimately, their proper effect. From the accession of\r\nHenry the Seventh to the breaking out of the civil wars, England\r\nenjoyed much greater exemption from war, foreign and domestic, than for\r\na long period before, and during the controversy between the houses of\r\nYork and Lancaster. These years of peace were favorable to commerce\r\nand the arts. Commerce and the arts augmented general and individual\r\nknowledge; and knowledge is the only fountain, both of the love and the\r\nprinciples of human liberty.\r\n\r\nOther powerful causes soon came into active play. The Reformation of\r\nLuther broke out, kindling up the minds of men afresh, leading to new\r\nhabits of thought, and awakening in individuals energies before unknown\r\neven to themselves. The religious controversies of this period changed\r\nsociety, as well as religion; indeed, it would be easy to prove, if this\r\noccasion were proper for it, that they changed society to a considerable\r\nextent, where they did not change the religion of the state. They\r\nchanged man himself; in his modes of thought, his consciousness of his\r\nown powers, and his desire of intellectual attainment. The spirit of\r\ncommercial and foreign adventure, therefore, on the one hand, which had\r\ngained so much strength and influence since the time of the discovery of\r\nAmerica, and, on the other, the assertion and maintenance of religious\r\nliberty, having their source indeed in the Reformation, but continued,\r\ndiversified, and constantly strengthened by the subsequent divisions of\r\nsentiment and opinion among the Reformers themselves, and this love of\r\nreligious liberty drawing after it or bringing along with it, as it\r\nalways does, an ardent devotion to the principle of civil liberty also,\r\nwere the powerful influences under which character was formed and men\r\ntrained, for the great work of introducing English civilization, English\r\nlaw, and what is more than all, Anglo-Saxon blood, into the wilderness\r\nof North America. Raleigh and his companions may be considered as the\r\ncreatures, principally, of the first of these causes. High-spirited,\r\nfull of the love of personal adventure, excited, too, in some degree, by\r\nthe hopes of sudden riches from the discovery of mines of the precious\r\nmetals, and not unwilling to diversify the labors of settling a colony\r\nwith occasional cruising against the Spaniards in the West Indian seas,\r\nthey crossed and recrossed the ocean, with a frequency which surprises\r\nus, when we consider the state of navigation, and which evinces a most\r\ndaring spirit.\r\n\r\nThe other cause peopled New England. The Mayflower sought our shores\r\nunder no high-wrought spirit of commercial adventure, no love of gold,\r\nno mixture of purpose warlike or hostile to any human being. Like the\r\ndove from the ark, she had put forth only to find rest. Solemn\r\nsupplications on the shore of the sea, in Holland, had invoked for her,\r\nat her departure, the blessings of Providence. The stars which guided\r\nher were the unobscured constellations of civil and religious liberty.\r\nHer deck was the altar of the living God. Fervent prayers on bended\r\nknees, mingled, morning and evening, with the voices of ocean, and the\r\nsighing of the wind in her shrouds. Every prosperous breeze, which,\r\ngently swelling her sails, helped the Pilgrims onward in their course,\r\nawoke new anthems of praise; and when the elements were wrought into\r\nfury, neither the tempest, tossing their fragile bark like a feather,\r\nnor the darkness and howling of the midnight storm, ever disturbed, in\r\nman or woman, the firm and settled purpose of their souls, to undergo\r\nall, and to do all, that the meekest patience, the boldest resolution,\r\nand the highest trust in God could enable human beings to suffer or to\r\nperform.\r\n\r\nSome differences may, doubtless, be traced at this day between the\r\ndescendants of the early colonists of Virginia and those of New England,\r\nowing to the different influences and different circumstances under\r\nwhich the respective settlements were made; but only enough to create a\r\npleasing variety in the midst of a general family resemblance.\r\n\r\n              \"Facies, non omnibus una,\r\n  Nec diversa tamen, qualem docet esse sororum.\"\r\n\r\nBut the habits, sentiments, and objects of both soon became modified by\r\nlocal causes, growing out of their condition in the New World; and as\r\nthis condition was essentially alike in both, and as both at once\r\nadopted the same general rules and principles of English jurisprudence,\r\nand became accustomed to the authority of representative bodies, these\r\ndifferences gradually diminished. They disappeared by the progress of\r\ntime, and the influence of intercourse. The necessity of some degree of\r\nunion and cooeperation to defend themselves against the savage tribes,\r\ntended to excite in them mutual respect and regard. They fought together\r\nin the wars against France. The great and common cause of the Revolution\r\nbound them to one another by new links of brotherhood; and at length the\r\npresent constitution of government united them happily and gloriously,\r\nto form the great republic of the world, and bound up their interests\r\nand fortunes, till the whole earth sees that there is now for them, in\r\npresent possession as well as in future hope, but \"One Country, One\r\nConstitution, and One Destiny.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonization of the tropical region, and the whole of the southern\r\nparts of the continent, by Spain and Portugal, was conducted on other\r\nprinciples, under the influence of other motives, and followed by far\r\ndifferent consequences. From the time of its discovery, the Spanish\r\ngovernment pushed forward its settlements in America, not only with\r\nvigor, but with eagerness; so that long before the first permanent\r\nEnglish settlement had been accomplished in what is now the United\r\nStates, Spain had conquered Mexico, Peru, and Chili, and stretched her\r\npower over nearly all the territory she ever acquired on this continent.\r\nThe rapidity of these conquests is to be ascribed in a great degree to\r\nthe eagerness, not to say the rapacity, of those numerous bands of\r\nadventurers, who were stimulated by individual interests and private\r\nhopes to subdue immense regions, and take possession of them in the name\r\nof the crown of Spain. The mines of gold and silver were the incitements\r\nto these efforts, and accordingly settlements were generally made, and\r\nSpanish authority established immediately on the subjugation of\r\nterritory, that the native population might be set to work by their new\r\nSpanish masters in the mines. From these facts, the love of gold--gold,\r\nnot produced by industry, nor accumulated by commerce, but gold dug from\r\nits native bed in the bowels of the earth, and that earth ravished from\r\nits rightful possessors by every possible degree of enormity, cruelty,\r\nand crime--was long the governing passion in Spanish wars and Spanish\r\nsettlements in America. Even Columbus himself did not wholly escape the\r\ninfluence of this base motive. In his early voyages we find him passing\r\nfrom island to island, inquiring everywhere for gold; as if God had\r\nopened the New World to the knowledge of the Old, only to gratify a\r\npassion equally senseless and sordid, and to offer up millions of an\r\nunoffending race of men to the destruction of the sword, sharpened both\r\nby cruelty and rapacity. And yet Columbus was far above his age and\r\ncountry. Enthusiastic, indeed, but sober, religious, and magnanimous;\r\nborn to great things and capable of high sentiments, as his noble\r\ndiscourse before Ferdinand and Isabella, as well as the whole history of\r\nhis life, shows. Probably he sacrificed much to the known sentiments of\r\nothers, and addressed to his followers motives likely to influence them.\r\nAt the same time, it is evident that he himself looked upon the world\r\nwhich he discovered as a world of wealth, all ready to be seized and\r\nenjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe conquerors and the European settlers of Spanish America were mainly\r\nmilitary commanders and common soldiers. The monarchy of Spain was not\r\ntransferred to this hemisphere, but it acted in it, as it acted at home,\r\nthrough its ordinary means, and its true representative, military force.\r\nThe robbery and destruction of the native race was the achievement of\r\nstanding armies, in the right of the king, and by his authority,\r\nfighting in his name, for the aggrandizement of his power and the\r\nextension of his prerogatives, with military ideas under arbitrary\r\nmaxims,--a portion of that dreadful instrumentality by which a perfect\r\ndespotism governs a people. As there was no liberty in Spain, how could\r\nliberty be transmitted to Spanish colonies?\r\n\r\nThe colonists of English America were of the people, and a people\r\nalready free. They were of the middle, industrious, and already\r\nprosperous class, the inhabitants of commercial and manufacturing\r\ncities, among whom liberty first revived and respired, after a sleep of\r\na thousand years in the bosom of the Dark Ages. Spain descended on the\r\nNew World in the armed and terrible image of her monarchy and her\r\nsoldiery; England approached it in the winning and popular garb of\r\npersonal rights, public protection, and civil freedom. England\r\ntransplanted liberty to America; Spain transplanted power. England,\r\nthrough the agency of private companies and the efforts of individuals,\r\ncolonized this part of North America by industrious individuals, making\r\ntheir own way in the wilderness, defending themselves against the\r\nsavages, recognizing their right to the soil, and with a general honest\r\npurpose of introducing knowledge as well as Christianity among them.\r\nSpain stooped on South America, like a vulture on its prey. Every thing\r\nwas force. Territories were acquired by fire and sword. Cities were\r\ndestroyed by fire and sword. Hundreds of thousands of human beings fell\r\nby fire and sword. Even conversion to Christianity was attempted by fire\r\nand sword.\r\n\r\nBehold, then, fellow-citizens, the difference resulting from the\r\noperation of the two principles! Here, to-day, on the summit of Bunker\r\nHill, and at the foot of this monument, behold the difference! I would\r\nthat the fifty thousand voices present could proclaim it with a shout\r\nwhich should be heard over the globe. Our inheritance was of liberty,\r\nsecured and regulated by law, and enlightened by religion and\r\nknowledge; that of South America was of power, stern, unrelenting,\r\ntyrannical, military power. And now look to the consequences of the two\r\nprinciples on the general and aggregate happiness of the human race.\r\nBehold the results, in all the regions conquered by Cortez and Pizarro,\r\nand the contrasted results here. I suppose the territory of the United\r\nStates may amount to one eighth, or one tenth, of that colonized by\r\nSpain on this continent; and yet in all that vast region there are but\r\nbetween one and two millions of people of European color and European\r\nblood, while in the United States there are fourteen millions who\r\nrejoice in their descent from the people of the more northern part of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nBut we may follow the difference in the original principle of\r\ncolonization, and in its character and objects, still further. We\r\nmust look to moral and intellectual results; we must consider\r\nconsequences, not only as they show themselves in hastening or\r\nretarding the increase of population and the supply of physical wants,\r\nbut in their civilization, improvement, and happiness. We must inquire\r\nwhat progress has been made in the true science of liberty, in the\r\nknowledge of the great principles of self-government, and in the\r\nprogress of man, as a social, moral, and religious being.\r\n\r\nI would not willingly say any thing on this occasion discourteous to the\r\nnew governments founded on the demolition of the power of the Spanish\r\nmonarchy. They are yet on their trial, and I hope for a favorable\r\nresult. But truth, sacred truth, and fidelity to the cause of civil\r\nliberty, compel me to say, that hitherto they have discovered quite too\r\nmuch of the spirit of that monarchy from which they separated\r\nthemselves. Quite too frequent resort is made to military force; and\r\nquite too much of the substance of the people is consumed in maintaining\r\narmies, not for defence against foreign aggression, but for enforcing\r\nobedience to domestic authority. Standing armies are the oppressive\r\ninstruments for governing the people, in the hands of hereditary and\r\narbitrary monarchs. A military republic, a government founded on mock\r\nelections, and supported only by the sword, is a movement indeed, but a\r\nretrograde and disastrous movement, from the regular and old-fashioned\r\nmonarchical systems. If men would enjoy the blessings of republican\r\ngovernment, they must govern themselves by reason, by mutual counsel\r\nand consultation, by a sense and feeling of general interest, and by the\r\nacquiescence of the minority in the will of the majority, properly\r\nexpressed; and, above all, the military must be kept, according to the\r\nlanguage of our Bill of Rights, in strict subordination to the civil\r\nauthority. Wherever this lesson is not both learned and practised, there\r\ncan be no political freedom. Absurd, preposterous is it, a scoff and a\r\nsatire on free forms of constitutional liberty, for frames of government\r\nto be prescribed by military leaders, and the right of suffrage to be\r\nexercised at the point of the sword.\r\n\r\nMaking all allowance for situation and climate, it cannot be doubted by\r\nintelligent minds, that the difference now existing between North and\r\nSouth America is justly attributable, in a great degree, to political\r\ninstitutions in the Old World and in the New. And how broad that\r\ndifference is! Suppose an assembly, in one of the valleys or on the side\r\nof one of the mountains of the southern half of the hemisphere, to be\r\nheld, this day, in the neighborhood of a large city;--what would be the\r\nscene presented? Yonder is a volcano, flaming and smoking, but shedding\r\nno light, moral or intellectual. At its foot is the mine, sometimes\r\nyielding, perhaps, large gains to capital, but in which labor is\r\ndestined to eternal and unrequited toil, and followed only by penury and\r\nbeggary. The city is filled with armed men; not a free people, armed and\r\ncoming forth voluntarily to rejoice in a public festivity, but hireling\r\ntroops, supported by forced loans, excessive impositions on commerce, or\r\ntaxes wrung from a half-fed and a half-clothed population. For the great\r\nthere are palaces covered with gold; for the poor there are hovels of\r\nthe meanest sort. There is an ecclesiastical hierarchy, enjoying the\r\nwealth of princes; but there are no means of education for the people.\r\nDo public improvements favor intercourse between place and place? So far\r\nfrom this, the traveller cannot pass from town to town, without danger,\r\nevery mile, of robbery and assassination. I would not overcharge or\r\nexaggerate this picture; but its principal features are all too truly\r\nsketched.\r\n\r\nAnd how does it contrast with the scene now actually before us? Look\r\nround upon these fields; they are verdant and beautiful, well\r\ncultivated, and at this moment loaded with the riches of the early\r\nharvest. The hands which till them are those of the free owners of the\r\nsoil, enjoying equal rights, and protected by law from oppression and\r\ntyranny. Look to the thousand vessels in our sight, filling the harbor,\r\nor covering the neighboring sea. They are the vehicles of a profitable\r\ncommerce, carried on by men who know that the profits of their hardy\r\nenterprise, when they make them, are their own; and this commerce is\r\nencouraged and regulated by wise laws, and defended, when need be, by\r\nthe valor and patriotism of the country. Look to that fair city, the\r\nabode of so much diffused wealth, so much general happiness and comfort,\r\nso much personal independence, and so much general knowledge, and not\r\nundistinguished, I may be permitted to add, for hospitality and social\r\nrefinement. She fears no forced contributions, no siege or sacking from\r\nmilitary leaders of rival factions. The hundred temples in which her\r\ncitizens worship God are in no danger of sacrilege. The regular\r\nadministration of the laws encounters no obstacle. The long processions\r\nof children and youth, which you see this day, issuing by thousands from\r\nher free schools, prove the care and anxiety with which a popular\r\ngovernment provides for the education and morals of the people.\r\nEverywhere there is order; everywhere there is security. Everywhere the\r\nlaw reaches to the highest and reaches to the lowest, to protect all in\r\ntheir rights, and to restrain all from wrong; and over all hovers\r\nliberty; that liberty for which our fathers fought and fell on this very\r\nspot, with her eye ever watchful, and her eagle wing ever wide\r\noutspread.\r\n\r\nThe colonies of Spain, from their origin to their end, were subject to\r\nthe sovereign authority of the mother country. Their government, as well\r\nas their commerce, was a strict home monopoly. If we add to this the\r\nestablished usage of filling important posts in the administration of\r\nthe colonies exclusively by natives of Old Spain, thus cutting off for\r\never all hopes of honorable preferment from every man born in the\r\nWestern hemisphere, causes enough rise up before us at once to account\r\nfully for the subsequent history and character of these provinces. The\r\nviceroys and provincial governors of Spain were never at home in their\r\ngovernments in America. They did not feel that they were of the people\r\nwhom they governed. Their official character and employment have a good\r\ndeal of resemblance to those of the proconsuls of Rome, in Asia,\r\nSicily, and Gaul; but obviously no resemblance to those of Carver and\r\nWinthrop, and very little to those of the governors of Virginia after\r\nthat Colony had established a popular House of Burgesses.\r\n\r\nThe English colonists in America, generally speaking, were men who\r\nwere seeking new homes in a new world. They brought with them their\r\nfamilies and all that was most dear to them. This was especially the\r\ncase with the colonists of Plymouth and Massachusetts. Many of them\r\nwere educated men, and all possessed their full share, according to\r\ntheir social condition, of the knowledge and attainments of that\r\nage. The distinctive characteristic of their settlement is the\r\nintroduction of the civilization of Europe into a wilderness, without\r\nbringing with it the political institutions of Europe. The arts,\r\nsciences, and literature of England came over with the settlers. That\r\ngreat portion of the common law which regulates the social and\r\npersonal relations and conduct of men, came also. The jury came; the\r\n_habeas corpus_ came; the testamentary power came; and the law of\r\ninheritance and descent came also, except that part of it which\r\nrecognizes the rights of primogeniture, which either did not come at\r\nall, or soon gave way to the rule of equal partition of estates among\r\nchildren. But the monarchy did not come, nor the aristocracy, nor the\r\nchurch, as an estate of the realm. Political institutions were to be\r\nframed anew, such as should be adapted to the state of things. But it\r\ncould not be doubtful what should be the nature and character of\r\nthese institutions. A general social equality prevailed among the\r\nsettlers, and an equality of political rights seemed the natural, if\r\nnot the necessary consequence. After forty years of revolution,\r\nviolence, and war, the people of France have placed at the head of the\r\nfundamental instrument of their government, as the great boon\r\nobtained by all their sufferings and sacrifices, the declaration that\r\nall Frenchmen are equal before the law. What France has reached only\r\nby the expenditure of so much blood and treasure, and the perpetration\r\nof so much crime, the English colonists obtained by simply changing\r\ntheir place, carrying with them the intellectual and moral culture of\r\nEurope, and the personal and social relations to which they were\r\naccustomed, but leaving behind their political institutions. It has\r\nbeen said with much vivacity, that the felicity of the American\r\ncolonists consisted in their escape from the past. This is true so far\r\nas respects political establishments, but no further. They brought\r\nwith them a full portion of all the riches of the past, in science, in\r\nart, in morals, religion, and literature. The Bible came with them.\r\nAnd it is not to be doubted, that to the free and universal reading of\r\nthe Bible, in that age, men were much indebted for right views of civil\r\nliberty. The Bible is a book of faith, and a book of doctrine, and a\r\nbook of morals, and a book of religion, of especial revelation from\r\nGod; but it is also a book which teaches man his own individual\r\nresponsibility, his own dignity, and his equality with his fellow-man.\r\n\r\nBacon and Locke, and Shakspeare and Milton, also came with the\r\ncolonists. It was the object of the first settlers to form new political\r\nsystems, but all that belonged to cultivated man, to family, to\r\nneighborhood, to social relations, accompanied them. In the Doric phrase\r\nof one of our own historians, \"they came to settle on bare creation\";\r\nbut their settlement in the wilderness, nevertheless, was not a\r\nlodgement of nomadic tribes, a mere resting-place of roaming savages. It\r\nwas the beginning of a permanent community, the fixed residence of\r\ncultivated men. Not only was English literature read, but English, good\r\nEnglish, was spoken and written, before the axe had made way to let in\r\nthe sun upon the habitations and fields of Plymouth and Massachusetts.\r\nAnd whatever may be said to the contrary, a correct use of the English\r\nlanguage is, at this day, more general throughout the United States,\r\nthan it is throughout England herself.\r\n\r\nBut another grand characteristic is, that, in the English colonies,\r\npolitical affairs were left to be managed by the colonists themselves.\r\nThis is another fact wholly distinguishing them in character, as it has\r\ndistinguished them in fortune, from the colonists of Spain. Here lies\r\nthe foundation of that experience in self-government, which has\r\npreserved order, and security, and regularity, amidst the play of\r\npopular institutions. Home government was the secret of the prosperity\r\nof the North American settlements. The more distinguished of the New\r\nEngland colonists, with a most remarkable sagacity and a long-sighted\r\nreach into futurity, refused to come to America unless they could bring\r\nwith them charters providing for the administration of their affairs in\r\nthis country.[66] They saw from the first the evils of being governed in\r\nthe New World by a power fixed in the Old. Acknowledging the general\r\nsuperiority of the crown, they still insisted on the right of passing\r\nlocal laws, and of local administration. And history teaches us the\r\njustice and the value of this determination in the example of Virginia.\r\nThe early attempts to settle that Colony failed, sometimes with the most\r\nmelancholy and fatal consequences, from want of knowledge, care, and\r\nattention on the part of those who had the charge of their affairs in\r\nEngland; and it was only after the issuing of the third charter, that\r\nits prosperity fairly commenced. The cause was, that by that third\r\ncharter the people of Virginia, for by this time they deserve to be so\r\ncalled, were allowed to constitute and establish the first popular\r\nrepresentative assembly which ever convened on this continent, the\r\nVirginia House of Burgesses.\r\n\r\nThe great elements, then, of the American system of government,\r\noriginally introduced by the colonists, and which were early in\r\noperation, and ready to be developed, more and more, as the progress of\r\nevents should justify or demand, were,--\r\n\r\nEscape from the existing political systems of Europe, including its\r\nreligious hierarchies, but the continued possession and enjoyment of its\r\nscience and arts, its literature, and its manners;\r\n\r\nHome government, or the power of making in the colony the municipal laws\r\nwhich were to govern it;\r\n\r\nEquality of rights;\r\n\r\nRepresentative assemblies, or forms of government founded on popular\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFew topics are more inviting, or more fit for philosophical discussion,\r\nthan the effect on the happiness of mankind of institutions founded upon\r\nthese principles; or, in other words, the influence of the New World\r\nupon the Old.\r\n\r\nHer obligations to Europe for science and art, laws, literature, and\r\nmanners, America acknowledges as she ought, with respect and gratitude.\r\nThe people of the United States, descendants of the English stock,\r\ngrateful for the treasures of knowledge derived from their English\r\nancestors, admit also, with thanks and filial regard, that among those\r\nancestors, under the culture of Hampden and Sydney and other assiduous\r\nfriends, that seed of popular liberty first germinated, which on our\r\nsoil has shot up to its full height, until its branches overshadow all\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nBut America has not failed to make returns. If she has not wholly\r\ncancelled the obligation, or equalled it by others of like weight, she\r\nhas, at least, made respectable advances towards repaying the debt. And\r\nshe admits, that, standing in the midst of civilized nations, and in a\r\ncivilized age, a nation among nations, there is a high part which she is\r\nexpected to act, for the general advancement of human interests and\r\nhuman welfare.\r\n\r\nAmerican mines have filled the mints of Europe with the precious metals.\r\nThe productions of the American soil and climate have poured out their\r\nabundance of luxuries for the tables of the rich, and of necessaries for\r\nthe sustenance of the poor. Birds and animals of beauty and value have\r\nbeen added to the European stocks; and transplantations from the\r\nunequalled riches of our forests have mingled themselves profusely with\r\nthe elms, and ashes, and Druidical oaks of England.\r\n\r\nAmerica has made contributions to Europe far more important. Who can\r\nestimate the amount, or the value, of the augmentation of the commerce\r\nof the world that has resulted from America? Who can imagine to himself\r\nwhat would now be the shock to the Eastern Continent, if the Atlantic\r\nwere no longer traversable, or if there were no longer American\r\nproductions, or American markets?\r\n\r\nBut America exercises influences, or holds out examples, for the\r\nconsideration of the Old World, of a much higher, because they are of a\r\nmoral and political character.\r\n\r\nAmerica has furnished to Europe proof of the fact, that popular\r\ninstitutions, founded on equality and the principle of representation,\r\nare capable of maintaining governments, able to secure the rights of\r\nperson, property, and reputation.\r\n\r\nAmerica has proved that it is practicable to elevate the mass of\r\nmankind,--that portion which in Europe is called the laboring, or lower\r\nclass,--to raise them to self-respect, to make them competent to act a\r\npart in the great right and great duty of self-government; and she has\r\nproved that this may be done by education and the diffusion of\r\nknowledge. She holds out an example, a thousand times more encouraging\r\nthan ever was presented before, to those nine tenths of the human race\r\nwho are born without hereditary fortune or hereditary rank.\r\n\r\nAmerica has furnished to the world the character of Washington! And if\r\nour American institutions had done nothing else, that alone would have\r\nentitled them to the respect of mankind.\r\n\r\nWashington! \"First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of\r\nhis countrymen!\" Washington is all our own! The enthusiastic veneration\r\nand regard in which the people of the United States hold him prove them\r\nto be worthy of such a countryman; while his reputation abroad reflects\r\nthe highest honor on his country. I would cheerfully put the question\r\nto-day to the intelligence of Europe and the world, what character of\r\nthe century, upon the whole, stands out in the relief of history, most\r\npure, most respectable, most sublime; and I doubt not, that, by a\r\nsuffrage approaching to unanimity, the answer would be Washington!\r\n\r\nThe structure now standing before us, by its uprightness, its solidity,\r\nits durability, is no unfit emblem of his character. His public virtues\r\nand public principles were as firm as the earth on which it stands; his\r\npersonal motives, as pure as the serene heaven in which its summit is\r\nlost. But, indeed, though a fit, it is an inadequate emblem. Towering\r\nhigh above the column which our hands have builded, beheld, not by the\r\ninhabitants of a single city or a single State, but by all the families\r\nof man, ascends the colossal grandeur of the character and life of\r\nWashington. In all the constituents of the one, in all the acts of the\r\nother, in all its titles to immortal love, admiration, and renown, it is\r\nan American production. It is the embodiment and vindication of our\r\nTransatlantic liberty. Born upon our soil, of parents also born upon it;\r\nnever for a moment having had sight of the Old World; instructed,\r\naccording to the modes of his time, only in the spare, plain, but\r\nwholesome elementary knowledge which our institutions provide for the\r\nchildren of the people; growing up beneath and penetrated by the genuine\r\ninfluences of American society; living from infancy to manhood and age\r\namidst our expanding, but not luxurious civilization; partaking in our\r\ngreat destiny of labor, our long contest with unreclaimed nature and\r\nuncivilized man, our agony of glory, the war of Independence, our great\r\nvictory of peace, the formation of the Union, and the establishment of\r\nthe Constitution; he is all, all our own! Washington is ours. That\r\ncrowded and glorious life,\r\n\r\n  \"Where multitudes of virtues passed along,\r\n  Each pressing foremost, in the mighty throng\r\n  Ambitious to be seen, then making room\r\n  For greater multitudes that were to come,\"--\r\n\r\nthat life was the life of an American citizen.\r\n\r\nI claim him for America. In all the perils, in every darkened moment of\r\nthe state, in the midst of the reproaches of enemies and the misgiving\r\nof friends, I turn to that transcendent name for courage and for\r\nconsolation. To him who denies or doubts whether our fervid liberty can\r\nbe combined with law, with order, with the security of property, with\r\nthe pursuits and advancement of happiness; to him who denies that our\r\nforms of government are capable of producing exaltation of soul, and the\r\npassion of true glory; to him who denies that we have contributed any\r\nthing to the stock of great lessons and great examples;--to all these I\r\nreply by pointing to Washington!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now, friends and fellow-citizens, it is time to bring this discourse\r\nto a close.\r\n\r\nWe have indulged in gratifying recollections of the past, in the\r\nprosperity and pleasures of the present, and in high hopes for the\r\nfuture. But let us remember that we have duties and obligations to\r\nperform, corresponding to the blessings which we enjoy. Let us remember\r\nthe trust, the sacred trust, attaching to the rich inheritance which we\r\nhave received from our fathers. Let us feel our personal responsibility,\r\nto the full extent of our power and influence, for the preservation of\r\nthe principles of civil and religious liberty. And let us remember that\r\nit is only religion, and morals, and knowledge, that can make men\r\nrespectable and happy, under any form of government. Let us hold fast\r\nthe great truth, that communities are responsible, as well as\r\nindividuals; that no government is respectable, which is not just; that\r\nwithout unspotted purity of public faith, without sacred public\r\nprinciple, fidelity, and honor, no mere forms of government, no\r\nmachinery of laws, can give dignity to political society. In our day and\r\ngeneration let us seek to raise and improve the moral sentiment, so\r\nthat we may look, not for a degraded, but for an elevated and improved\r\nfuture. And when both we and our children shall have been consigned to\r\nthe house appointed for all living, may love of country and pride of\r\ncountry glow with equal fervor among those to whom our names and our\r\nblood shall have descended! And then, when honored and decrepit age\r\nshall lean against the base of this monument, and troops of ingenuous\r\nyouth shall be gathered round it, and when the one shall speak to the\r\nother of its objects, the purposes of its construction, and the great\r\nand glorious events with which it is connected, there shall rise from\r\nevery youthful breast the ejaculation, \"Thank God, I--I also--AM AN\r\nAMERICAN!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [61] An Address delivered on Bunker Hill, on the 17th of June, 1843.\r\n\r\n   [62] William Tudor died at Rio de Janeiro, as Charge d'Affaires of the\r\n        United States, in 1830.\r\n\r\n   [63] William Sullivan died in Boston in 1839, George Blake in 1841,\r\n        both gentlemen of great political and legal eminence.\r\n\r\n   [64] William Prescott (since deceased, in 1844), son of Colonel William\r\n        Prescott, who commanded on the 17th of June, 1775, and father of\r\n        William H.

It embraces the whole site of the redoubt, and a part of\r\n  the site of the breastwork. According to the most accurate plan of\r\n  the town and the battle (Page's), the monument stands where the\r\n  southwest angle of the redoubt was, and the whole of the redoubt was\r\n  between the monument and the street that bounds it on the west. The\r\n  small mound in the northeast corner of the square is supposed to be\r\n  the remains of the breastwork. Warren fell about two hundred feet\r\n  west of the monument. An iron fence incloses the square, and another\r\n  surrounds the monument. The square has entrances on each of its\r\n  sides, and at each of its corners, and is surrounded by a walk and\r\n  rows of trees.\r\n\r\n  \"The obelisk is thirty feet in diameter at the base, about fifteen\r\n  feet at the top of the truncated part, and was designed to be two\r\n  hundred and twenty feet high; but the mortar and the seams between\r\n  the stones make the precise height two hundred and twenty-one feet.\r\n  Within the shaft is a hollow cone, with a spiral stairway winding\r\n  round it to its summit, which enters a circular chamber at the top.\r\n  There are ninety courses of stone in the shaft,--six of them below\r\n  the ground, and eighty-four above the ground. The capstone, or apex,\r\n  is a single stone, four feet square at the base, and three feet six\r\n  inches in height, weighing two and a half tons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADAMS AND JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the decease of General Washington, on the 14th of December, 1799,\r\nthe public mind has never been so powerfully affected in this part of\r\nthe country by any similar event, as by the death of John Adams, on the\r\n4th of July, 1826. The news reached Boston in the evening of that day.\r\nThe decease of this venerable fellow-citizen must at all times have\r\nappealed with much force to the patriotic sympathies of the people of\r\nMassachusetts. It acquired a singular interest from the year and the day\r\non which it took place;--the 4th of July of the year completing the half\r\ncentury from that ever memorable era in the history of this country and\r\nthe world, the Declaration of Independence; a measure in which Mr. Adams\r\nhimself had taken so distinguished a part. The emotions of the public\r\nwere greatly increased by the indications given by Mr. Adams in his last\r\nhours, that he was fully aware that the day was the anniversary of\r\nIndependence, and by his dying allusion to the supposed fact that his\r\ncolleague, Jefferson, survived him. When, in the course of a few days,\r\nthe news arrived from Virginia, that he also had departed this life, on\r\nthe same day and a few hours before Mr. Adams, the sensibility of the\r\ncommunity, as of the country at large, was touched beyond all example.\r\nThe occurrence was justly deemed without a parallel in history. The\r\nvarious circumstances of association and coincidence which marked the\r\ncharacters and careers of these great men, and especially those of their\r\nsimultaneous decease on the 4th of July, were dwelt upon with melancholy\r\nbut untiring interest. The circles of private life, the press, public\r\nbodies, and the pulpit, were for some time almost engrossed with the\r\ntopic; and solemn rites of commemoration were performed throughout the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAn early day was appointed for this purpose by the City Council of\r\nBoston. The whole community manifested its sympathy in the extraordinary\r\nevent; and on the 2d of August, 1826, at the request of the municipal\r\nauthorities, and in the presence of an immense audience, the following\r\nDiscourse was delivered in Faneuil Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADAMS AND JEFFERSON.[67]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an unaccustomed spectacle. For the first time, fellow-citizens,\r\nbadges of mourning shroud the columns and overhang the arches of this\r\nhall. These walls, which were consecrated, so long ago, to the cause of\r\nAmerican liberty, which witnessed her infant struggles, and rung with\r\nthe shouts of her earliest victories, proclaim, now, that distinguished\r\nfriends and champions of that great cause have fallen. It is right that\r\nit should be thus. The tears which flow, and the honors that are paid,\r\nwhen the founders of the republic die, give hope that the republic\r\nitself may be immortal. It is fit that, by public assembly and solemn\r\nobservance, by anthem and by eulogy, we commemorate the services of\r\nnational benefactors, extol their virtues, and render thanks to God for\r\neminent blessings, early given and long continued, through their agency,\r\nto our favored country.\r\n\r\nADAMS and JEFFERSON are no more; and we are assembled, fellow-citizens,\r\nthe aged, the middle-aged, and the young, by the spontaneous impulse of\r\nall, under the authority of the municipal government, with the\r\npresence of the chief magistrate of the Commonwealth, and others its\r\nofficial representatives, the University, and the learned societies,\r\nto bear our part in those manifestations of respect and gratitude which\r\npervade the whole land. ADAMS and JEFFERSON are no more. On our\r\nfiftieth anniversary, the great day of national jubilee, in the very\r\nhour of public rejoicing, in the midst of echoing and reechoing voices\r\nof thanksgiving, while their own names were on all tongues, they took\r\ntheir flight together to the world of spirits.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that no one can safely be pronounced happy while he lives,\r\nif that event which terminates life can alone crown its honors and its\r\nglory, what felicity is here! The great epic of their lives, how happily\r\nconcluded! Poetry itself has hardly terminated illustrious lives, and\r\nfinished the career of earthly renown, by such a consummation. If we had\r\nthe power, we could not wish to reverse this dispensation of the Divine\r\nProvidence. The great objects of life were accomplished, the drama was\r\nready to be closed. It has closed; our patriots have fallen; but so\r\nfallen, at such age, with such coincidence, on such a day, that we\r\ncannot rationally lament that that end has come, which we knew could not\r\nbe long deferred.\r\n\r\nNeither of these great men, fellow-citizens, could have died, at any\r\ntime, without leaving an immense void in our American society. They\r\nhave been so intimately, and for so long a time, blended with the\r\nhistory of the country, and especially so united, in our thoughts\r\nand recollections, with the events of the Revolution, that the death of\r\neither would have touched the chords of public sympathy. We should have\r\nfelt that one great link, connecting us with former times, was broken;\r\nthat we had lost something more, as it were, of the presence of the\r\nRevolution itself, and of the act of independence, and were driven\r\non, by another great remove from the days of our country's early\r\ndistinction, to meet posterity, and to mix with the future. Like the\r\nmariner, whom the currents of the ocean and the winds carry along,\r\ntill he sees the stars which have directed his course and lighted his\r\npathless way descend, one by one, beneath the rising horizon, we\r\nshould have felt that the stream of time had borne us onward till\r\nanother great luminary, whose light had cheered us and whose guidance\r\nwe had followed, had sunk away from our sight.\r\n\r\nBut the concurrence of their death on the anniversary of Independence\r\nhas naturally awakened stronger emotions. Both had been Presidents, both\r\nhad lived to great age, both were early patriots, and both were\r\ndistinguished and ever honored by their immediate agency in the act of\r\nindependence. It cannot but seem striking and extraordinary, that these\r\ntwo should live to see the fiftieth year from the date of that act; that\r\nthey should complete that year; and that then, on the day which had fast\r\nlinked for ever their own fame with their country's glory, the heavens\r\nshould open to receive them both at once. As their lives themselves were\r\nthe gifts of Providence, who is not willing to recognize in their happy\r\ntermination, as well as in their long continuance, proofs that our\r\ncountry and its benefactors are objects of His care?\r\n\r\nADAMS and JEFFERSON, I have said, are no more. As human beings, indeed,\r\nthey are no more. They are no more, as in 1776, bold and fearless\r\nadvocates of independence; no more, as at subsequent periods, the head\r\nof the government; no more, as we have recently seen them, aged and\r\nvenerable objects of admiration and regard. They are no more. They\r\nare dead. But how little is there of the great and good which can die!\r\nTo their country they yet live, and live for ever. They live in all\r\nthat perpetuates the remembrance of men on earth; in the recorded proofs\r\nof their own great actions, in the offspring of their intellect, in\r\nthe deep-engraved lines of public gratitude, and in the respect and\r\nhomage of mankind. They live in their example; and they live,\r\nemphatically, and will live, in the influence which their lives and\r\nefforts, their principles and opinions, now exercise, and will continue\r\nto exercise, on the affairs of men, not only in their own country,\r\nbut throughout the civilized world. A superior and commanding human\r\nintellect, a truly great man, when Heaven vouchsafes so rare a gift,\r\nis not a temporary flame, burning brightly for a while, and then\r\ngiving place to returning darkness. It is rather a spark of fervent\r\nheat, as well as radiant light, with power to enkindle the common\r\nmass of human mind; so that when it glimmers in its own decay, and\r\nfinally goes out in death, no night follows, but it leaves the world all\r\nlight, all on fire, from the potent contact of its own spirit. Bacon\r\ndied; but the human understanding, roused by the touch of his\r\nmiraculous wand to a perception of the true philosophy and the just\r\nmode of inquiring after truth, has kept on its course successfully and\r\ngloriously. Newton died; yet the courses of the spheres are still\r\nknown, and they yet move on by the laws which he discovered, and in\r\nthe orbits which he saw, and described for them, in the infinity of\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nNo two men now live, fellow-citizens, perhaps it may be doubted whether\r\nany two men have ever lived in one age, who, more than those we now\r\ncommemorate, have impressed on mankind their own sentiments in regard to\r\npolitics and government, infused their own opinions more deeply into\r\nthe opinions of others, or given a more lasting direction to the current\r\nof human thought. Their work doth not perish with them. The tree which\r\nthey assisted to plant will flourish, although they water it and protect\r\nit no longer; for it has struck its roots deep, it has sent them to the\r\nvery centre; no storm, not of force to burst the orb, can overturn it;\r\nits branches spread wide; they stretch their protecting arms broader and\r\nbroader, and its top is destined to reach the heavens. We are not\r\ndeceived. There is no delusion here. No age will come in which the\r\nAmerican Revolution will appear less than it is, one of the greatest\r\nevents in human history. No age will come in which it shall cease to be\r\nseen and felt, on either continent, that a mighty step, a great advance,\r\nnot only in American affairs, but in human affairs, was made on the 4th\r\nof July, 1776. And no age will come, we trust, so ignorant or so unjust\r\nas not to see and acknowledge the efficient agency of those we now honor\r\nin producing that momentous event.\r\n\r\nWe are not assembled, therefore, fellow-citizens, as men overwhelmed\r\nwith calamity by the sudden disruption of the ties of friendship or\r\naffection, or as in despair for the republic by the untimely blighting\r\nof its hopes. Death has not surprised us by an unseasonable blow. We\r\nhave, indeed, seen the tomb close, but it has closed only over mature\r\nyears, over long-protracted public service, over the weakness of age,\r\nand over life itself only when the ends of living had been fulfilled.\r\nThese suns, as they rose slowly and steadily, amidst clouds and storms,\r\nin their ascendant, so they have not rushed from their meridian to sink\r\nsuddenly in the west. Like the mildness, the serenity, the continuing\r\nbenignity of a summer's day, they have gone down with slow-descending,\r\ngrateful, long-lingering light; and now that they are beyond the visible\r\nmargin of the world, good omens cheer us from \"the bright track of their\r\nfiery car\"!\r\n\r\nThere were many points of similarity in the lives and fortunes of these\r\ngreat men. They belonged to the same profession, and had pursued its\r\nstudies and its practice, for unequal lengths of time indeed, but with\r\ndiligence and effect. Both were learned and able lawyers. They were\r\nnatives and inhabitants, respectively, of those two of the Colonies\r\nwhich at the Revolution were the largest and most powerful, and which\r\nnaturally had a lead in the political affairs of the times. When the\r\nColonies became in some degree united, by the assembling of a general\r\nCongress, they were brought to act together in its deliberations, not\r\nindeed at the same time, but both at early periods. Each had already\r\nmanifested his attachment to the cause of the country, as well as his\r\nability to maintain it, by printed addresses, public speeches, extensive\r\ncorrespondence, and whatever other mode could be adopted for the purpose\r\nof exposing the encroachments of the British Parliament, and animating\r\nthe people to a manly resistance. Both were not only decided, but early,\r\nfriends of Independence. While others yet doubted, they were resolved;\r\nwhere others hesitated, they pressed forward. They were both members of\r\nthe committee for preparing the Declaration of Independence, and they\r\nconstituted the sub-committee appointed by the other members to make the\r\ndraft. They left their seats in Congress, being called to other public\r\nemployments, at periods not remote from each other, although one of them\r\nreturned to it afterwards for a short time. Neither of them was of the\r\nassembly of great men which formed the present Constitution, and neither\r\nwas at any time a member of Congress under its provisions. Both have\r\nbeen public ministers abroad, both Vice-Presidents and both Presidents\r\nof the United States. These coincidences are now singularly crowned and\r\ncompleted. They have died together; and they died on the anniversary of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nWhen many of us were last in this place, fellow-citizens, it was on the\r\nday of that anniversary. We were met to enjoy the festivities belonging\r\nto the occasion, and to manifest our grateful homage to our political\r\nfathers. We did not, we could not here, forget our venerable neighbor of\r\nQuincy. We knew that we were standing, at a time of high and palmy\r\nprosperity, where he had stood in the hour of utmost peril; that we saw\r\nnothing but liberty and security, where he had met the frown of power;\r\nthat we were enjoying every thing, where he had hazarded every thing;\r\nand just and sincere plaudits rose to his name, from the crowds which\r\nfilled this area, and hung over these galleries. He whose grateful duty\r\nit was to speak to us,[68] on that day, of the virtues of our fathers,\r\nhad, indeed, admonished us that time and years were about to level his\r\nvenerable frame with the dust. But he bade us hope that \"the sound of a\r\nnation's joy, rushing from our cities, ringing from our valleys, echoing\r\nfrom our hills, might yet break the silence of his aged ear; that the\r\nrising blessings of grateful millions might yet visit with glad light\r\nhis decaying vision.\" Alas! that vision was then closing for ever. Alas!\r\nthe silence which was then settling on that aged ear was an everlasting\r\nsilence! For, lo! in the very moment of our festivities, his freed\r\nspirit ascended to God who gave it! Human aid and human solace terminate\r\nat the grave; or we would gladly have borne him upward, on a nation's\r\noutspread hands; we would have accompanied him, and with the blessings\r\nof millions and the prayers of millions, commended him to the Divine\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nWhile still indulging our thoughts, on the coincidence of the death of\r\nthis venerable man with the anniversary of Independence, we learn that\r\nJefferson, too, has fallen; and that these aged patriots, these\r\nillustrious fellow-laborers, have left our world together. May not such\r\nevents raise the suggestion that they are not undesigned, and that\r\nHeaven does so order things, as sometimes to attract strongly the\r\nattention and excite the thoughts of men? The occurrence has added new\r\ninterest to our anniversary, and will be remembered in all time to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe occasion, fellow-citizens, requires some account of the lives and\r\nservices of JOHN ADAMS and THOMAS JEFFERSON. This duty must necessarily\r\nbe performed with great brevity, and in the discharge of it I shall be\r\nobliged to confine myself, principally, to those parts of their history\r\nand character which belonged to them as public men.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS was born at Quincy, then part of the ancient town of\r\nBraintree, on the 19th day of October (old style), 1735. He was a\r\ndescendant of the Puritans, his ancestors having early emigrated\r\nfrom England, and settled in Massachusetts. Discovering in childhood\r\na strong love of reading and of knowledge, together with marks of\r\ngreat strength and activity of mind, proper care was taken by his\r\nworthy father to provide for his education. He pursued his youthful\r\nstudies in Braintree, under Mr. Marsh, a teacher whose fortune it\r\nwas that Josiah Quincy, Jr., as well as the subject of these remarks,\r\nshould receive from him his instruction in the rudiments of classical\r\nliterature. Having been admitted, in 1751, a member of Harvard\r\nCollege, Mr. Adams was graduated, in course, in 1755; and on the\r\ncatalogue of that institution, his name, at the time of his death, was\r\nsecond among the living Alumni, being preceded only by that of the\r\nvenerable Holyoke. With what degree of reputation he left the\r\nUniversity is not now precisely known. We know only that he was\r\ndistinguished in a class which numbered Locke and Hemmenway among its\r\nmembers. Choosing the law for his profession, he commenced and\r\nprosecuted its studies at Worcester, under the direction of Samuel\r\nPutnam, a gentleman whom he has himself described as an acute man, an\r\nable and learned lawyer, and as being in large professional practice at\r\nthat time. In 1758 he was admitted to the bar, and entered upon the\r\npractice of the law in Braintree. He is understood to have made his\r\nfirst considerable effort, or to have attained his first signal\r\nsuccess, at Plymouth, on one of those occasions which furnish the\r\nearliest opportunity for distinction to many young men of the\r\nprofession, a jury trial, and a criminal cause. His business\r\nnaturally grew with his reputation, and his residence in the vicinity\r\nafforded the opportunity, as his growing eminence gave the power, of\r\nentering on a larger field of practice in the capital. In 1766 he\r\nremoved his residence to Boston, still continuing his attendance on\r\nthe neighboring circuits, and not unfrequently called to remote parts\r\nof the Province. In 1770 his professional firmness was brought to a\r\ntest of some severity, on the application of the British officers and\r\nsoldiers to undertake their defence, on the trial of the indictments\r\nfound against them on account of the transactions of the memorable\r\n5th of March. He seems to have thought, on this occasion, that a man can\r\nno more abandon the proper duties of his profession, than he can\r\nabandon other duties. The event proved, that, as he judged well for\r\nhis own reputation, so, too, he judged well for the interest and\r\npermanent fame of his country. The result of that trial proved, that,\r\nnotwithstanding the high degree of excitement then existing in\r\nconsequence of the measures of the British government, a jury of\r\nMassachusetts would not deprive the most reckless enemies, even the\r\nofficers of that standing army quartered among them, which they so\r\nperfectly abhorred, of any part of that protection which the law, in\r\nits mildest and most indulgent interpretation, affords to persons\r\naccused of crimes.\r\n\r\nWithout following Mr. Adams's professional course further suffice it to\r\nsay, that on the first establishment of the judicial tribunals under\r\nthe authority of the State, in 1776, he received an offer of the high\r\nand responsible station of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of\r\nMassachusetts. But he was destined for another and a different\r\ncareer. From early life the bent of his mind was toward politics; a\r\npropensity which the state of the times, if it did not create,\r\ndoubtless very much strengthened. Public subjects must have occupied\r\nthe thoughts and filled up the conversation in the circles in which\r\nhe then moved; and the interesting questions at that time just\r\narising could not but seize on a mind like his, ardent, sanguine, and\r\npatriotic. A letter, fortunately preserved, written by him at\r\nWorcester, so early as the 12th of October, 1755, is a proof of very\r\ncomprehensive views, and uncommon depth of reflection, in a young\r\nman not yet quite twenty. In this letter he predicted the transfer of\r\npower, and the establishment of a new seat of empire in America; he\r\npredicted, also, the increase of population in the Colonies; and\r\nanticipated their naval distinction, and foretold that all Europe\r\ncombined could not subdue them. All this is said, not on a public\r\noccasion or for effect, but in the style of sober and friendly\r\ncorrespondence, as the result of his own thoughts. \"I sometimes retire,\"\r\nsaid he, at the close of the letter, \"and, laying things together, form\r\nsome reflections pleasing to myself. The produce of one of these\r\nreveries you have read above.\"[69] This prognostication so early in\r\nhis own life, so early in the history of the country, of independence,\r\nof vast increase of numbers, of naval force, of such augmented\r\npower as might defy all Europe, is remarkable. It is more remarkable\r\nthat its author should live to see fulfilled to the letter what could\r\nhave seemed to others, at the time, but the extravagance of youthful\r\nfancy. His earliest political feelings were thus strongly American,\r\nand from this ardent attachment to his native soil he never departed.\r\n\r\nWhile still living at Quincy, and at the age of twenty-four, Mr. Adams\r\nwas present, in this town, at the argument before the Supreme Court\r\nrespecting _Writs of Assistance_, and heard the celebrated and\r\npatriotic speech of JAMES OTIS. Unquestionably, that was a masterly\r\nperformance. No flighty declamation about liberty, no superficial\r\ndiscussion of popular topics, it was a learned, penetrating, convincing,\r\nconstitutional argument, expressed in a strain of high and resolute\r\npatriotism. He grasped the question then pending between England and\r\nher Colonies with the strength of a lion; and if he sometimes\r\nsported, it was only because the lion himself is sometimes playful.\r\nIts success appears to have been as great as its merits, and its\r\nimpression was widely felt. Mr. Adams himself seems never to have lost\r\nthe feeling it produced, and to have entertained constantly the\r\nfullest conviction of its important effects. \"I do say,\" he observes,\r\n\"in the most solemn manner, that Mr. Otis's Oration against Writs of\r\nAssistance breathed into this nation the breath of life.\"[70]\r\n\r\nIn 1765 Mr. Adams laid before the public, anonymously, a series of\r\nessays, afterwards collected in a volume in London, under the title of A\r\nDissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law.[71] The object of this work\r\nwas to show that our New England ancestors, in consenting to exile\r\nthemselves from their native land, were actuated mainly by the desire of\r\ndelivering themselves from the power of the hierarchy, and from the\r\nmonarchical and aristocratical systems of the other continent; and to\r\nmake this truth bear with effect on the politics of the times. Its tone\r\nis uncommonly bold and animated for that period. He calls on the people,\r\nnot only to defend, but to study and understand, their rights and\r\nprivileges; urges earnestly the necessity of diffusing general\r\nknowledge; invokes the clergy and the bar, the colleges and academies,\r\nand all others who have the ability and the means to expose the\r\ninsidious designs of arbitrary power, to resist its approaches, and to\r\nbe persuaded that there is a settled design on foot to enslave all\r\nAmerica. \"Be it remembered,\" says the author, \"that liberty must, at all\r\nhazards, be supported. We have a right to it, derived from our Maker.\r\nBut if we had not, our fathers have earned and bought it for us, at the\r\nexpense of their ease, their estates, their pleasure, and their blood.\r\nAnd liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the\r\npeople, who have a right, from the frame of their nature, to knowledge,\r\nas their great Creator, who does nothing in vain, has given them\r\nunderstandings and a desire to know. But, besides this, they have a\r\nright, an indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine right, to that\r\nmost dreaded and envied kind of knowledge, I mean of the characters and\r\nconduct of their rulers. Rulers are no more than attorneys, agents, and\r\ntrustees for the people; and if the cause, the interest and trust, is\r\ninsidiously betrayed, or wantonly trifled away, the people have a right\r\nto revoke the authority that they themselves have deputed, and to\r\nconstitute abler and better agents, attorneys, and trustees.\"\r\n\r\nThe citizens of this town conferred on Mr. Adams his first political\r\ndistinction, and clothed him with his first political trust, by electing\r\nhim one of their representatives, in 1770. Before this time he had\r\nbecome extensively known throughout the Province, as well by the part he\r\nhad acted in relation to public affairs, as by the exercise of his\r\nprofessional ability. He was among those who took the deepest interest\r\nin the controversy with England, and whether in or out of the\r\nlegislature, his time and talents were alike devoted to the cause. In\r\nthe years 1773 and 1774 he was chosen a Councillor by the members of the\r\nGeneral Court, but rejected by Governor Hutchinson in the former of\r\nthose years, and by Governor Gage in the latter.\r\n\r\nThe time was now at hand, however, when the affairs of the Colonies\r\nurgently demanded united counsels throughout the country. An open\r\nrupture with the parent state appeared inevitable, and it was but the\r\ndictate of prudence that those who were united by a common interest\r\nand a common danger should protect that interest and guard against\r\nthat danger by united efforts. A general Congress of Delegates from\r\nall the Colonies having been proposed and agreed to, the House of\r\nRepresentatives, on the 17th of June, 1774, elected James Bowdoin,\r\nThomas Cushing, Samuel Adams, John Adams, and Robert Treat Paine,\r\ndelegates from Massachusetts. This appointment was made at Salem,\r\nwhere the General Court had been convened by Governor Gage, in the\r\nlast hour of the existence of a House of Representatives under the\r\nProvincial Charter. While engaged in this important business, the\r\nGovernor, having been informed of what was passing, sent his secretary\r\nwith a message dissolving the General Court. The secretary, finding\r\nthe door locked, directed the messenger to go in and inform the Speaker\r\nthat the secretary was at the door with a message from the Governor. The\r\nmessenger returned, and informed the secretary that the orders of\r\nthe House were that the doors should be kept fast; whereupon the\r\nsecretary soon after read upon the stairs a proclamation dissolving\r\nthe General Court. Thus terminated, for ever, the actual exercise of\r\nthe political power of England in or over Massachusetts. The four\r\nlast-named delegates accepted their appointments, and took their\r\nseats in Congress the first day of its meeting, the 5th of September,\r\n1774, in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the first Congress are well known, and have been\r\nuniversally admired. It is in vain that we would look for superior\r\nproofs of wisdom, talent, and patriotism. Lord Chatham said, that, for\r\nhimself, he must declare that he had studied and admired the free states\r\nof antiquity, the master states of the world, but that for solidity of\r\nreasoning, force of sagacity, and wisdom of conclusion, no body of men\r\ncould stand in preference to this Congress. It is hardly inferior praise\r\nto say, that no production of that great man himself can be pronounced\r\nsuperior to several of the papers published as the proceedings of this\r\nmost able, most firm, most patriotic assembly. There is, indeed, nothing\r\nsuperior to them in the range of political disquisition. They not only\r\nembrace, illustrate, and enforce every thing which political philosophy,\r\nthe love of liberty, and the spirit of free inquiry had antecedently\r\nproduced, but they add new and striking views of their own, and apply\r\nthe whole, with irresistible force, in support of the cause which had\r\ndrawn them together.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams was a constant attendant on the deliberations of this body,\r\nand bore an active part in its important measures. He was of the\r\ncommittee to state the rights of the Colonies, and of that also which\r\nreported the Address to the King.\r\n\r\nAs it was in the Continental Congress, fellow-citizens, that those whose\r\ndeaths have given rise to this occasion were first brought together, and\r\ncalled upon to unite their industry and their ability in the service of\r\nthe country, let us now turn to the other of these distinguished men,\r\nand take a brief notice of his life up to the period when he appeared\r\nwithin the walls of Congress.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON, descended from ancestors who had been settled in\r\nVirginia for some generations, was born near the spot on which he died,\r\nin the county of Albemarle, on the 2d of April (old style), 1743. His\r\nyouthful studies were pursued in the neighborhood of his father's\r\nresidence until he was removed to the College of William and Mary, the\r\nhighest honors of which he in due time received. Having left the College\r\nwith reputation, he applied himself to the study of the law under the\r\ntuition of George Wythe, one of the highest judicial names of which that\r\nState can boast. At an early age he was elected a member of the\r\nlegislature, in which he had no sooner appeared than he distinguished\r\nhimself by knowledge, capacity, and promptitude.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson appears to have been imbued with an early love of letters\r\nand science, and to have cherished a strong disposition to pursue these\r\nobjects. To the physical sciences, especially, and to ancient classic\r\nliterature, he is understood to have had a warm attachment, and never\r\nentirely to have lost sight of them in the midst of the busiest\r\noccupations. But the times were times for action, rather than for\r\ncontemplation. The country was to be defended, and to be saved, before\r\nit could be enjoyed. Philosophic leisure and literary pursuits, and even\r\nthe objects of professional attention, were all necessarily postponed to\r\nthe urgent calls of the public service. The exigency of the country made\r\nthe same demand on Mr. Jefferson that it made on others who had the\r\nability and the disposition to serve it; and he obeyed the call;\r\nthinking and feeling in this respect with the great Roman orator: \"Quis\r\nenim est tam cupidus in perspicienda cognoscendaque rerum natura, ut, si\r\nei tractanti contemplantique res cognitione dignissimas subito sit\r\nallatum periculum discrimenque patriae, cui subvenire opitularique\r\npossit, non illa omnia relinquat atque abjiciat, etiam si dinumerare se\r\nstellas, aut metiri mundi magnitudinem posse arbitretur?\"[72]\r\n\r\nEntering with all his heart into the cause of liberty, his ability,\r\npatriotism, and power with the pen naturally drew upon him a large\r\nparticipation in the most important concerns. Wherever he was, there was\r\nfound a soul devoted to the cause, power to defend and maintain it, and\r\nwillingness to incur all its hazards. In 1774 he published a Summary\r\nView of the Rights of British America, a valuable production among those\r\nintended to show the dangers which threatened the liberties of the\r\ncountry, and to encourage the people in their defence. In June, 1775, he\r\nwas elected a member of the Continental Congress, as successor to Peyton\r\nRandolph, who had resigned his place on account of ill health, and took\r\nhis seat in that body on the 21st of the same month.\r\n\r\nAnd now, fellow-citizens, without pursuing the biography of these\r\nillustrious men further, for the present, let us turn our attention to\r\nthe most prominent act of their lives, their participation in the\r\nDECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\nPreparatory to the introduction of that important measure, a committee,\r\nat the head of which was Mr. Adams, had reported a resolution, which\r\nCongress adopted on the 10th of May, recommending, in substance, to all\r\nthe Colonies which had not already established governments suited to the\r\nexigencies of their affairs, _to adopt such government as would, in the\r\nopinion of the representatives of the people, best conduce to the\r\nhappiness and safety of their constituents in particular, and America in\r\ngeneral_.\r\n\r\nThis significant vote was soon followed by the direct proposition which\r\nRichard Henry Lee had the honor to submit to Congress, by resolution, on\r\nthe 7th day of June. The published journal does not expressly state it,\r\nbut there is no doubt, I suppose, that this resolution was in the same\r\nwords, when originally submitted by Mr. Lee, as when finally passed.\r\nHaving been discussed on Saturday, the 8th, and Monday, the 10th of\r\nJune, this resolution was on the last mentioned day postponed for\r\nfurther consideration to the first day of July; and at the same time it\r\nwas voted, that a committee be appointed to prepare a Declaration to the\r\neffect of the resolution. This committee was elected by ballot, on the\r\nfollowing day, and consisted of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin\r\nFranklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert R. Livingston.\r\n\r\nIt is usual, when committees are elected by ballot, that their members\r\nshould be arranged in order, according to the number of votes which each\r\nhas received. Mr. Jefferson, therefore, had received the highest, and\r\nMr. Adams the next highest number of votes. The difference is said to\r\nhave been but of a single vote. Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Adams, standing\r\nthus at the head of the committee, were requested by the other members\r\nto act as a sub-committee to prepare the draft; and Mr. Jefferson drew\r\nup the paper. The original draft, as brought by him from his study, and\r\nsubmitted to the other members of the committee, with interlineations in\r\nthe handwriting of Dr. Franklin, and others in that of Mr. Adams, was in\r\nMr. Jefferson's possession at the time of his death.[73] The merit of\r\nthis paper is Mr. Jefferson's. Some changes were made in it at the\r\nsuggestion of other members of the committee, and others by Congress\r\nwhile it was under discussion. But none of them altered the tone, the\r\nframe, the arrangement, or the general character of the instrument. As a\r\ncomposition, the Declaration is Mr. Jefferson's. It is the production of\r\nhis mind, and the high honor of it belongs to him, clearly and\r\nabsolutely.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been said, as if it were a derogation from the merits\r\nof this paper, that it contains nothing new; that it only states grounds\r\nof proceeding, and presses topics of argument, which had often been\r\nstated and pressed before. But it was not the object of the Declaration\r\nto produce any thing new. It was not to invent reasons for independence,\r\nbut to state those which governed the Congress. For great and sufficient\r\ncauses, it was proposed to declare independence; and the proper business\r\nof the paper to be drawn was to set forth those causes, and justify the\r\nauthors of the measure, in any event of fortune, to the country and to\r\nposterity. The cause of American independence, moreover, was now to be\r\npresented to the world in such manner, if it might so be, as to engage\r\nits sympathy, to command its respect, to attract its admiration; and in\r\nan assembly of most able and distinguished men, THOMAS JEFFERSON had the\r\nhigh honor of being the selected advocate of this cause. To say that he\r\nperformed his great work well, would be doing him injustice. To say that\r\nhe did excellently well, admirably well, would be inadequate and halting\r\npraise. Let us rather say, that he so discharged the duty assigned him,\r\nthat all Americans may well rejoice that the work of drawing the\r\ntitle-deed of their liberties devolved upon him.\r\n\r\nWith all its merits, there are those who have thought that there was one\r\nthing in the Declaration to be regretted; and that is, the asperity and\r\napparent anger with which it speaks of the person of the king; the\r\nindustrious ability with which it accumulates and charges upon him all\r\nthe injuries which the Colonies had suffered from the mother country.\r\nPossibly some degree of injustice, now or hereafter, at home or abroad,\r\nmay be done to the character of Mr. Jefferson, if this part of the\r\nDeclaration be not placed in its proper light. Anger or resentment,\r\ncertainly much less personal reproach and invective, could not properly\r\nfind place in a composition of such high dignity, and of such lofty and\r\npermanent character.\r\n\r\nA single reflection on the original ground of dispute between England\r\nand the Colonies is sufficient to remove any unfavorable impression in\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of all the Colonies, while Colonies, admitted themselves\r\nbound by their allegiance to the king; but they disclaimed altogether\r\nthe authority of Parliament; holding themselves, in this respect, to\r\nresemble the condition of Scotland and Ireland before the respective\r\nunions of those kingdoms with England, when they acknowledged allegiance\r\nto the same king, but had each its separate legislature. The tie,\r\ntherefore, which our Revolution was to break did not subsist between us\r\nand the British Parliament, or between us and the British government in\r\nthe aggregate, but directly between us and the king himself. The\r\nColonies had never admitted themselves subject to Parliament. That was\r\nprecisely the point of the original controversy. They had uniformly\r\ndenied that Parliament had authority to make laws for them. There was,\r\ntherefore, no subjection to Parliament to be thrown off.[74] But\r\nallegiance to the king did exist, and had been uniformly acknowledged;\r\nand down to 1775 the most solemn assurances had been given that it was\r\nnot intended to break that allegiance, or to throw it off. Therefore, as\r\nthe direct object and only effect of the Declaration, according to the\r\nprinciples on which the controversy had been maintained on our part,\r\nwere to sever the tie of allegiance which bound us to the king, it was\r\nproperly and necessarily founded on acts of the crown itself, as its\r\njustifying causes. Parliament is not so much as mentioned in the whole\r\ninstrument. When odious and oppressive acts are referred to, it is done\r\nby charging the king with confederating with others \"in pretended acts\r\nof legislation\"; the object being constantly to hold the king himself\r\ndirectly responsible for those measures which were the grounds of\r\nseparation. Even the precedent of the English Revolution was not\r\noverlooked, and in this case, as well as in that, occasion was found to\r\nsay that the king had _abdicated_ the government. Consistency with the\r\nprinciples upon which resistance began, and with all the previous state\r\npapers issued by Congress, required that the Declaration should be\r\nbottomed on the misgovernment of the king; and therefore it was properly\r\nframed with that aim and to that end. The king was known, indeed, to\r\nhave acted, as in other cases, by his ministers, and with his\r\nParliament; but as our ancestors had never admitted themselves subject\r\neither to ministers or to Parliament, there were no reasons to be given\r\nfor now refusing obedience to their authority. This clear and obvious\r\nnecessity of founding the Declaration on the misconduct of the king\r\nhimself, gives to that instrument its personal application, and its\r\ncharacter of direct and pointed accusation.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration having been reported to Congress by the committee, the\r\nresolution itself was taken up and debated on the first day of July, and\r\nagain on the second, on which last day it was agreed to and adopted, in\r\nthese words:--\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That these united Colonies are, and of right ought to be,\r\nfree and independent States; that they are absolved from all allegiance\r\nto the British crown, and that all political connection between them and\r\nthe state of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus passed the main resolution, Congress proceeded to consider\r\nthe reported draught of the Declaration. It was discussed on the second,\r\nand third, and FOURTH days of the month, in committee of the whole; and\r\non the last of those days, being reported from that committee, it\r\nreceived the final approbation and sanction of Congress. It was ordered,\r\nat the same time, that copies be sent to the several States, and that it\r\nbe proclaimed at the head of the army. The Declaration thus published\r\ndid not bear the names of the members, for as yet it had not been signed\r\nby them. It was authenticated, like other papers of the Congress, by the\r\nsignatures of the President and Secretary. On the 19th of July, as\r\nappears by the secret journal, Congress \"_Resolved_, That the\r\nDeclaration, passed on the fourth, be fairly engrossed on parchment,\r\nwith the title and style of 'THE UNANIMOUS DECLARATION OF THE THIRTEEN\r\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA'; and that the same, when engrossed be signed\r\nby every member of Congress.\" And on the SECOND DAY OF AUGUST following,\r\n\"the Declaration, being engrossed and compared at the table, was signed\r\nby the members.\" So that it happens, fellow-citizens, that we pay these\r\nhonors to their memory on the anniversary of that day (2d of August) on\r\nwhich these great men actually signed their names to the Declaration.\r\nThe Declaration was thus made, that is, it passed and was adopted as an\r\nact of Congress, on the fourth of July; it was then signed, and\r\ncertified by the President and Secretary, like other acts. The FOURTH OF\r\nJULY, therefore, is the ANNIVERSARY OF THE DECLARATION. But the\r\nsignatures of the members present were made to it, being then engrossed\r\non parchment, on the second day of August. Absent members afterwards\r\nsigned, as they came in; and indeed it bears the names of some who were\r\nnot chosen members of Congress until after the fourth of July. The\r\ninterest belonging to the subject will be sufficient, I hope, to\r\njustify these details.[75]\r\n\r\nThe Congress of the Revolution, fellow-citizens, sat with closed doors,\r\nand no report of its debates was ever made. The discussion, therefore,\r\nwhich accompanied this great measure, has never been preserved, except\r\nin memory and by tradition. But it is, I believe, doing no injustice to\r\nothers to say, that the general opinion was, and uniformly has been,\r\nthat in debate, on the side of independence, JOHN ADAMS had no equal.\r\nThe great author of the Declaration himself has expressed that opinion\r\nuniformly and strongly. \"JOHN ADAMS,\" said he, in the hearing of him who\r\nhas now the honor to address you, \"JOHN ADAMS was our colossus on the\r\nfloor. Not graceful, not elegant, not always fluent, in his public\r\naddresses, he yet came out with a power, both of thought and of\r\nexpression, which moved us from our seats.\"\r\n\r\nFor the part which he was here to perform, Mr. Adams doubtless was\r\neminently fitted. He possessed a bold spirit, which disregarded danger,\r\nand a sanguine reliance on the goodness of the cause, and the virtues of\r\nthe people, which led him to overlook all obstacles. His character, too,\r\nhad been formed in troubled times. He had been rocked in the early\r\nstorms of the controversy, and had acquired a decision and a hardihood\r\nproportioned to the severity of the discipline which he had undergone.\r\n\r\nHe not only loved the American cause devoutly, but had studied and\r\nunderstood it. It was all familiar to him. He had tried his powers on\r\nthe questions which it involved, often and in various ways; and had\r\nbrought to their consideration whatever of argument or illustration the\r\nhistory of his own country, the history of England, or the stores of\r\nancient or of legal learning could furnish. Every grievance enumerated\r\nin the long catalogue of the Declaration had been the subject of his\r\ndiscussion, and the object of his remonstrance and reprobation. From\r\n1760, the Colonies, the rights of the Colonies, the liberties of the\r\nColonies, and the wrongs inflicted on the Colonies, had engaged his\r\nconstant attention; and it has surprised those who have had the\r\nopportunity of witnessing it, with what full remembrance and with what\r\nprompt recollection he could refer, in his extreme old age, to every act\r\nof Parliament affecting the Colonies, distinguishing and stating their\r\nrespective titles, sections, and provisions; and to all the Colonial\r\nmemorials, remonstrances, and petitions, with whatever else belonged to\r\nthe intimate and exact history of the times from that year to 1775. It\r\nwas, in his own judgment, between these years that the American people\r\ncame to a full understanding and thorough knowledge of their rights, and\r\nto a fixed resolution of maintaining them; and bearing himself an active\r\npart in all important transactions, the controversy with England being\r\nthen in effect the business of his life, facts, dates, and particulars\r\nmade an impression which was never effaced. He was prepared, therefore,\r\nby education and discipline, as well as by natural talent and natural\r\ntemperament, for the part which he was now to act.\r\n\r\nThe eloquence of Mr. Adams resembled his general character, and formed,\r\nindeed, a part of it. It was bold, manly, and energetic; and such the\r\ncrisis required. When public bodies are to be addressed on momentous\r\noccasions, when great interests are at stake, and strong passions\r\nexcited, nothing is valuable in speech farther than as it is connected\r\nwith high intellectual and moral endowments. Clearness, force, and\r\nearnestness are the qualities which produce conviction. True eloquence,\r\nindeed, does not consist in speech. It cannot be brought from far. Labor\r\nand learning may toil for it, but they will toil in vain. Words and\r\nphrases may be marshalled in every way, but they cannot compass it. It\r\nmust exist in the man, in the subject, and in the occasion. Affected\r\npassion, intense expression, the pomp of declamation, all may aspire to\r\nit; they cannot reach it. It comes, if it come at all, like the\r\noutbreaking of a fountain from the earth, or the bursting forth of\r\nvolcanic fires, with spontaneous, original, native force. The graces\r\ntaught in the schools, the costly ornaments and studied contrivances of\r\nspeech, shock and disgust men, when their own lives, and the fate of\r\ntheir wives, their children, and their country, hang on the decision of\r\nthe hour. Then words have lost their power, rhetoric is vain, and all\r\nelaborate oratory contemptible. Even genius itself then feels rebuked\r\nand subdued, as in the presence of higher qualities. Then patriotism is\r\neloquent; then self-devotion is eloquent. The clear conception,\r\noutrunning the deductions of logic, the high purpose, the firm resolve,\r\nthe dauntless spirit, speaking on the tongue, beaming from the eye,\r\ninforming every feature, and urging the whole man onward, right onward\r\nto his object,--this, this is eloquence; or rather it is something\r\ngreater and higher than all eloquence, it is action, noble, sublime,\r\ngodlike action.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1776, the controversy had passed the stage of argument. An\r\nappeal had been made to force, and opposing armies were in the field.\r\nCongress, then, was to decide whether the tie which had so long bound us\r\nto the parent state was to be severed at once, and severed for ever. All\r\nthe Colonies had signified their resolution to abide by this decision,\r\nand the people looked for it with the most intense anxiety. And surely,\r\nfellow-citizens, never, never were men called to a more important\r\npolitical deliberation. If we contemplate it from the point where they\r\nthen stood, no question could be more full of interest; if we look at it\r\nnow, and judge of its importance by its effects, it appears of still\r\ngreater magnitude.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, bring before us the assembly, which was about to decide a\r\nquestion thus big with the fate of empire. Let us open their doors and\r\nlook in upon their deliberations. Let us survey the anxious and\r\ncare-worn countenances, let us hear the firm-toned voices, of this band\r\nof patriots.\r\n\r\nHANCOCK presides over the solemn sitting; and one of those not yet\r\nprepared to pronounce for absolute independence is on the floor, and is\r\nurging his reasons for dissenting from the declaration.\r\n\r\n\"Let us pause! This step, once taken, cannot be retraced. This\r\nresolution, once passed, will cut off all hope of reconciliation. If\r\nsuccess attend the arms of England, we shall then be no longer Colonies,\r\nwith charters and with privileges; these will all be forfeited by this\r\nact; and we shall be in the condition of other conquered people, at the\r\nmercy of the conquerors. For ourselves, we may be ready to run the\r\nhazard; but are we ready to carry the country to that length? Is success\r\nso probable as to justify it? Where is the military, where the naval\r\npower by which we are to resist the whole strength of the arm of\r\nEngland, for she will exert that strength to the utmost? Can we rely on\r\nthe constancy and perseverance of the people? or will they not act as\r\nthe people of other countries have acted, and, wearied with a long war,\r\nsubmit, in the end, to a worse oppression? While we stand on our old\r\nground, and insist on redress of grievances, we know we are right, and\r\nare not answerable for consequences. Nothing, then, can be imputed to\r\nus. But if we now change our object, carry our pretensions farther, and\r\nset up for absolute independence, we shall lose the sympathy of mankind.\r\nWe shall no longer be defending what we possess, but struggling for\r\nsomething which we never did possess, and which we have solemnly and\r\nuniformly disclaimed all intention of pursuing, from the very outset of\r\nthe troubles. Abandoning thus our old ground, of resistance only to\r\narbitrary acts of oppression, the nations will believe the whole to have\r\nbeen mere pretence, and they will look on us, not as injured, but as\r\nambitious subjects. I shudder before this responsibility. It will be on\r\nus, if, relinquishing the ground on which we have stood so long, and\r\nstood so safely, we now proclaim independence, and carry on the war for\r\nthat object, while these cities burn, these pleasant fields whiten and\r\nbleach with the bones of their owners, and these streams run blood. It\r\nwill be upon us, it will be upon us, if, failing to maintain this\r\nunseasonable and ill-judged declaration, a sterner despotism, maintained\r\nby military power, shall be established over our posterity, when we\r\nourselves, given up by an exhausted, a harassed, a misled people, shall\r\nhave expiated our rashness and atoned for our presumption on the\r\nscaffold.\"\r\n\r\nIt was for Mr. Adams to reply to arguments like these. We know his\r\nopinions, and we know his character. He would commence with his\r\naccustomed directness and earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give my hand and my\r\nheart to this vote. It is true, indeed, that in the beginning we aimed\r\nnot at independence. But there's a Divinity which shapes our ends. The\r\ninjustice of England has driven us to arms; and, blinded to her own\r\ninterest for our good, she has obstinately persisted, till independence\r\nis now within our grasp. We have but to reach forth to it, and it is\r\nours. Why, then, should we defer the Declaration? Is any man so weak as\r\nnow to hope for a reconciliation with England, which shall leave either\r\nsafety to the country and its liberties, or safety to his own life and\r\nhis own honor? Are not you, Sir, who sit in that chair, is not he, our\r\nvenerable colleague near you, are you not both already the proscribed\r\nand predestined objects of punishment and of vengeance? Cut off from all\r\nhope of royal clemency, what are you, what can you be, while the power\r\nof England remains, but outlaws? If we postpone independence, do we mean\r\nto carry on, or to give up, the war? Do we mean to submit to the\r\nmeasures of Parliament, Boston Port Bill and all? Do we mean to submit,\r\nand consent that we ourselves shall be ground to powder, and our country\r\nand its rights trodden down in the dust? I know we do not mean to\r\nsubmit. We never shall submit. Do we intend to violate that most solemn\r\nobligation ever entered into by men, that plighting, before God, of our\r\nsacred honor to Washington, when, putting him forth to incur the dangers\r\nof war, as well as the political hazards of the times, we promised to\r\nadhere to him, in every extremity, with our fortunes and our lives? I\r\nknow there is not a man here, who would not rather see a general\r\nconflagration sweep over the land, or an earthquake sink it, than one\r\njot or tittle of that plighted faith fall to the ground. For myself,\r\nhaving, twelve months ago, in this place, moved you, that George\r\nWashington be appointed commander of the forces raised, or to be raised,\r\nfor defence of American liberty,[76] may my right hand forget her\r\ncunning, and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I hesitate or\r\nwaver in the support I give him.\r\n\r\n\"The war, then, must go on. We must fight it through. And if the war\r\nmust go on, why put off longer the Declaration of Independence? That\r\nmeasure will strengthen us. It will give us character abroad. The\r\nnations will then treat with us, which they never can do while we\r\nacknowledge ourselves subjects, in arms against our sovereign. Nay, I\r\nmaintain that England herself will sooner treat for peace with us on the\r\nfooting of independence, than consent, by repealing her acts, to\r\nacknowledge that her whole conduct towards us has been a course of\r\ninjustice and oppression. Her pride will be less wounded by submitting\r\nto that course of things which now predestinates our independence, than\r\nby yielding the points in controversy to her rebellious subjects. The\r\nformer she would regard as the result of fortune; the latter she would\r\nfeel as her own deep disgrace. Why, then, why then, Sir, do we not as\r\nsoon as possible change this from a civil to a national war? And since\r\nwe must fight it through, why not put ourselves in a state to enjoy all\r\nthe benefits of victory, if we gain the victory?\r\n\r\n\"If we fail, it can be no worse for us. But we shall not fail. The cause\r\nwill raise up armies; the cause will create navies. The people, the\r\npeople, if we are true to them, will carry us, and will carry\r\nthemselves, gloriously, through this struggle. I care not how fickle\r\nother people have been found. I know the people of these Colonies, and I\r\nknow that resistance to British aggression is deep and settled in their\r\nhearts and cannot be eradicated. Every Colony, indeed, has expressed its\r\nwillingness to follow, if we but take the lead. Sir, the Declaration\r\nwill inspire the people with increased courage. Instead of a long and\r\nbloody war for the restoration of privileges, for redress of grievances,\r\nfor chartered immunities, held under a British king, set before them the\r\nglorious object of entire independence, and it will breathe into them\r\nanew the breath of life. Read this Declaration at the head of the army;\r\nevery sword will be drawn from its scabbard, and the solemn vow uttered,\r\nto maintain it, or to perish on the bed of honor. Publish it from the\r\npulpit; religion will approve it, and the love of religious liberty will\r\ncling round it, resolved to stand with it, or fall with it. Send it to\r\nthe public halls; proclaim it there; let them hear it who heard the\r\nfirst roar of the enemy's cannon; let them see it who saw their brothers\r\nand their sons fall on the field of Bunker Hill, and in the streets of\r\nLexington and Concord, and the very walls will cry out in its support.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I know the uncertainty of human affairs, but I see, I see clearly,\r\nthrough this day's business. You and I, indeed, may rue it. We may not\r\nlive to the time when this Declaration shall be made good. We may die;\r\ndie colonists; die slaves; die, it may be, ignominiously and on the\r\nscaffold. Be it so. Be it so. If it be the pleasure of Heaven that my\r\ncountry shall require the poor offering of my life, the victim shall be\r\nready at the appointed hour of sacrifice, come when that hour may. But\r\nwhile I do live, let me have a country, or at least the hope of a\r\ncountry, and that a free country.\r\n\r\n\"But whatever may be our fate, be assured, be assured that this\r\nDeclaration will stand. It may cost treasure, and it may cost blood; but\r\nit will stand, and it will richly compensate for both. Through the\r\nthick gloom of the present, I see the brightness of the future, as the\r\nsun in heaven. We shall make this a glorious, an immortal day. When we\r\nare in our graves, our children will honor it. They will celebrate it\r\nwith thanksgiving, with festivity, with bonfires, and illuminations. On\r\nits annual return they will shed tears, copious, gushing tears, not of\r\nsubjection and slavery, not of agony and distress, but of exultation, of\r\ngratitude, and of joy. Sir, before God, I believe the hour is come. My\r\njudgment approves this measure, and my whole heart is in it. All that I\r\nhave, and all that I am, and all that I hope, in this life, I am now\r\nready here to stake upon it; and I leave off as I begun, that live or\r\ndie, survive or perish, I am for the Declaration. It is my living\r\nsentiment, and by the blessing of God it shall be my dying sentiment,\r\nIndependence, _now_, and INDEPENDENCE FOR EVER.\"[77]\r\n\r\nAnd so that day shall be honored, illustrious prophet and patriot! so\r\nthat day shall be honored, and as often as it returns, thy renown shall\r\ncome along with it, and the glory of thy life, like the day of thy\r\ndeath, shall not fail from the remembrance of men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would be unjust, fellow-citizens, on this occasion, while we\r\nexpress our veneration for him who is the immediate subject of these\r\nremarks, were we to omit a most respectful, affectionate, and\r\ngrateful mention of those other great men, his colleagues, who stood\r\nwith him, and with the same spirit, the same devotion, took part in\r\nthe interesting transaction. HANCOCK, the proscribed HANCOCK, exiled\r\nfrom his home by a military governor, cut off by proclamation from the\r\nmercy of the crown,--Heaven reserved for him the distinguished honor\r\nof putting this great question to the vote, and of writing his own\r\nname first, and most conspicuously, on that parchment which spoke\r\ndefiance to the power of the crown of England. There, too, is the\r\nname of that other proscribed patriot, SAMUEL ADAMS, a man who\r\nhungered and thirsted for the independence of his country; who\r\nthought the Declaration halted and lingered, being himself not only\r\nready, but eager, for it, long before it was proposed; a man of the\r\ndeepest sagacity, the dearest foresight, and the profoundest judgment\r\nin men. And there is GERRY, himself among the earliest and the\r\nforemost of the patriots, found, when the battle of Lexington summoned\r\nthem to common counsels, by the side of WARREN; a man who lived to\r\nserve his country at home and abroad, and to die in the second place\r\nin the government. There, too, is the inflexible, the upright, the\r\nSpartan character, ROBERT TREAT PAINE. He also lived to serve his\r\ncountry through the struggle, and then withdrew from her councils,\r\nonly that he might give his labors and his life to his native State,\r\nin another relation. These names, fellow-citizens, are the treasures\r\nof the Commonwealth; and they are treasures which grow brighter by\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to resume the narrative, and to finish with great\r\nbrevity the notice of the lives of those whose virtues and services we\r\nhave met to commemorate.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams remained in Congress from its first meeting till November,\r\n1777, when he was appointed Minister to France. He proceeded on that\r\nservice in the February following, embarking in the frigate Boston, from\r\nthe shore of his native town, at the foot of Mount Wollaston. The year\r\nfollowing, he was appointed commissioner to treat of peace with England.\r\nReturning to the United States, he was a delegate from Braintree in the\r\nConvention for framing the Constitution of this Commonwealth, in\r\n1780.[78] At the latter end of the same year, he again went abroad in\r\nthe diplomatic service of the country, and was employed at various\r\ncourts, and occupied with various negotiations, until 1788. The\r\nparticulars of these interesting and important services this occasion\r\ndoes not allow time to relate. In 1782 he concluded our first treaty\r\nwith Holland. His negotiations with that republic, his efforts to\r\npersuade the States-General to recognize our independence, his incessant\r\nand indefatigable exertions to represent the American cause favorably on\r\nthe Continent, and to counteract the designs of its enemies, open and\r\nsecret, and his successful undertaking to obtain loans, on the credit of\r\na nation yet new and unknown, are among his most arduous, most useful,\r\nmost honorable services. It was his fortune to bear a part in the\r\nnegotiation for peace with England, and in something more than six\r\nyears from the Declaration which he had so strenuously supported, he had\r\nthe satisfaction of seeing the minister plenipotentiary of the crown\r\nsubscribe his name to the instrument which declared that his \"Britannic\r\nMajesty acknowledged the United States to be free, sovereign, and\r\nindependent.\" In these important transactions, Mr. Adams's conduct\r\nreceived the marked approbation of Congress and of the country.\r\n\r\nWhile abroad, in 1787, he published his Defence of the American\r\nConstitutions; a work of merit and ability, though composed with haste,\r\non the spur of a particular occasion, in the midst of other occupations,\r\nand under circumstances not admitting of careful revision. The immediate\r\nobject of the work was to counteract the weight of opinions advanced by\r\nseveral popular European writers of that day, M. Turgot, the Abbe de\r\nMably, and Dr. Price, at a time when the people of the United States\r\nwere employed in forming and revising their systems of government.\r\n\r\nReturning to the United States in 1788, he found the new government\r\nabout going into operation, and was himself elected the first\r\nVice-President, a situation which he filled with reputation for eight\r\nyears, at the expiration of which he was raised to the Presidential\r\nchair, as immediate successor to the immortal Washington. In this high\r\nstation he was succeeded by Mr. Jefferson, after a memorable controversy\r\nbetween their respective friends, in 1801; and from that period his\r\nmanner of life has been known to all who hear me. He has lived, for\r\nfive-and-twenty years, with every enjoyment that could render old age\r\nhappy. Not inattentive to the occurrences of the times, political cares\r\nhave yet not materially, or for any long time, disturbed his repose. In\r\n1820 he acted as elector of President and Vice-President, and in the\r\nsame year we saw him, then at the age of eighty-five, a member of the\r\nConvention of this Commonwealth called to revise the Constitution. Forty\r\nyears before, he had been one of those who formed that Constitution; and\r\nhe had now the pleasure of witnessing that there was little which the\r\npeople desired to change.[79] Possessing all his faculties to the end\r\nof his long life, with an unabated love of reading and contemplation, in\r\nthe centre of interesting circles of friendship and affection, he was\r\nblessed in his retirement with whatever of repose and felicity the\r\ncondition of man allows. He had, also, other enjoyments. He saw around\r\nhim that prosperity and general happiness which had been the object of\r\nhis public cares and labors. No man ever beheld more clearly, and for a\r\nlonger time, the great and beneficial effects of the services rendered\r\nby himself to his country. That liberty which he so early defended, that\r\nindependence of which he was so able an advocate and supporter, he saw,\r\nwe trust, firmly and securely established. The population of the country\r\nthickened around him faster, and extended wider, than his own sanguine\r\npredictions had anticipated; and the wealth, respectability, and power\r\nof the nation sprang up to a magnitude which it is quite impossible he\r\ncould have expected to witness in his day. He lived also to behold those\r\nprinciples of civil freedom which had been developed, established, and\r\npractically applied in America, attract attention, command respect, and\r\nawaken imitation, in other regions of the globe; and well might, and\r\nwell did, he exclaim, \"Where will the consequences of the American\r\nRevolution end?\"\r\n\r\nIf any thing yet remain to fill this cup of happiness, let it be added,\r\nthat he lived to see a great and intelligent people bestow the highest\r\nhonor in their gift where he had bestowed his own kindest parental\r\naffections and lodged his fondest hopes. Thus honored in life, thus\r\nhappy at death, he saw the JUBILEE, and he died; and with the last\r\nprayers which trembled on his lips was the fervent supplication for his\r\ncountry, \"Independence for ever!\"[80]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson, having been occupied in the years 1778 and 1779 in the\r\nimportant service of revising the laws of Virginia, was elected Governor\r\nof that State, as successor to Patrick Henry, and held the situation\r\nwhen the State was invaded by the British arms. In 1781 he published his\r\nNotes on Virginia, a work which attracted attention in Europe as well as\r\nAmerica, dispelled many misconceptions respecting this continent, and\r\ngave its author a place among men distinguished for science. In\r\nNovember, 1783, he again took his seat in the Continental Congress, but\r\nin the May following was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary, to act\r\nabroad, in the negotiation of commercial treaties, with Dr. Franklin and\r\nMr. Adams. He proceeded to France in execution of this mission,\r\nembarking at Boston; and that was the only occasion on which he ever\r\nvisited this place. In 1785 he was appointed Minister to France, the\r\nduties of which situation he continued to perform until October, 1789,\r\nwhen he obtained leave to retire, just on the eve of that tremendous\r\nrevolution which has so much agitated the world in our times. Mr.\r\nJefferson's discharge of his diplomatic duties was marked by great\r\nability, diligence, and patriotism; and while he resided at Paris, in\r\none of the most interesting periods, his character for intelligence, his\r\nlove of knowledge and of the society of learned men, distinguished him\r\nin the highest circles of the French capital. No court in Europe had at\r\nthat time in Paris a representative commanding or enjoying higher\r\nregard, for political knowledge or for general attainments, than the\r\nminister of this then infant republic. Immediately on his return to his\r\nnative country, at the organization of the government under the present\r\nConstitution, his talents and experience recommended him to President\r\nWashington for the first office in his gift. He was placed at the head\r\nof the Department of State. In this situation, also, he manifested\r\nconspicuous ability. His correspondence with the ministers of other\r\npowers residing here, and his instructions to our own diplomatic agents\r\nabroad, are among our ablest state papers. A thorough knowledge of the\r\nlaws and usages of nations, perfect acquaintance with the immediate\r\nsubject before him, great felicity, and still greater facility, in\r\nwriting, show themselves in whatever effort his official situation\r\ncalled on him to make. It is believed by competent judges, that the\r\ndiplomatic intercourse of the government of the United States, from the\r\nfirst meeting of the Continental Congress in 1774 to the present time,\r\ntaken together, would not suffer, in respect to the talent with which it\r\nhas been conducted, by comparison with any thing which other and older\r\ngovernments can produce; and to the attainment of this respectability\r\nand distinction Mr. Jefferson has contributed his full part.\r\n\r\nOn the retirement of General Washington from the Presidency, and the\r\nelection of Mr. Adams to that office in 1797, he was chosen\r\nVice-President. While presiding in this capacity over the deliberations\r\nof the Senate, he compiled and published a Manual of Parliamentary\r\nPractice, a work of more labor and more merit than is indicated by its\r\nsize. It is now received as the general standard by which proceedings\r\nare regulated, not only in both Houses of Congress, but in most of the\r\nother legislative bodies in the country. In 1801 he was elected\r\nPresident, in opposition to Mr. Adams, and reelected in 1805, by a vote\r\napproaching towards unanimity.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of his final retirement from public life, in 1808, Mr.\r\nJefferson lived as became a wise man. Surrounded by affectionate\r\nfriends, his ardor in the pursuit of knowledge undiminished, with\r\nuncommon health and unbroken spirits, he was able to enjoy largely the\r\nrational pleasures of life, and to partake in that public prosperity\r\nwhich he had so much contributed to produce. His kindness and\r\nhospitality, the charm of his conversation, the ease of his manners, the\r\nextent of his acquirements, and, especially, the full store of\r\nRevolutionary incidents which he had treasured in his memory, and which\r\nhe knew when and how to dispense, rendered his abode in a high degree\r\nattractive to his admiring countrymen, while his high public and\r\nscientific character drew towards him every intelligent and educated\r\ntraveller from abroad. Both Mr. Adams and Mr. Jefferson had the pleasure\r\nof knowing that the respect which they so largely received was not paid\r\nto their official stations. They were not men made great by office; but\r\ngreat men, on whom the country for its own benefit had conferred office.\r\nThere was that in them which office did not give, and which the\r\nrelinquishment of office did not, and could not, take away. In their\r\nretirement, in the midst of their fellow-citizens, themselves private\r\ncitizens, they enjoyed as high regard and esteem as when filling the\r\nmost important places of public trust.\r\n\r\nThere remained to Mr. Jefferson yet one other work of patriotism and\r\nbeneficence, the establishment of a university in his native State. To\r\nthis object he devoted years of incessant and anxious attention, and by\r\nthe enlightened liberality of the Legislature of Virginia, and the\r\ncooeperation of other able and zealous friends, he lived to see it\r\naccomplished. May all success attend this infant seminary; and may\r\nthose who enjoy its advantages, as often as their eyes shall rest on the\r\nneighboring height, recollect what they owe to their disinterested and\r\nindefatigable benefactor; and may letters honor him who thus labored in\r\nthe cause of letters![81]\r\n\r\nThus useful, and thus respected, passed the old age of Thomas Jefferson.\r\nBut time was on its ever-ceaseless wing, and was now bringing the last\r\nhour of this illustrious man. He saw its approach with undisturbed\r\nserenity. He counted the moments as they passed, and beheld that his\r\nlast sands were falling. That day, too, was at hand which he had helped\r\nto make immortal. One wish, one hope, if it were not presumptuous, beat\r\nin his fainting breast. Could it be so, might it please God, he would\r\ndesire once more to see the sun, once more to look abroad on the scene\r\naround him, on the great day of liberty. Heaven, in its mercy, fulfilled\r\nthat prayer. He saw that sun, he enjoyed its sacred light, he thanked\r\nGod for this mercy, and bowed his aged head to the grave. \"Felix, non\r\nvitae tantum claritate, sed etiam opportunitate mortis.\"\r\n\r\nThe last public labor of Mr. Jefferson naturally suggests the expression\r\nof the high praise which is due, both to him and to Mr. Adams, for their\r\nuniform and zealous attachment to learning, and to the cause of general\r\nknowledge. Of the advantages of learning, indeed, and of literary\r\naccomplishments, their own characters were striking recommendations and\r\nillustrations. They were scholars, ripe and good scholars; widely\r\nacquainted with ancient, as well as modern literature, and not\r\naltogether uninstructed in the deeper sciences. Their acquirements,\r\ndoubtless, were different, and so were the particular objects of their\r\nliterary pursuits; as their tastes and characters, in these respects,\r\ndiffered like those of other men. Being, also, men of busy lives, with\r\ngreat objects requiring action constantly before them, their attainments\r\nin letters did not become showy or obtrusive. Yet I would hazard the\r\nopinion, that, if we could now ascertain all the causes which gave them\r\neminence and distinction in the midst of the great men with whom they\r\nacted, we should find not among the least their early acquisitions in\r\nliterature, the resources which it furnished, the promptitude and\r\nfacility which it communicated, and the wide field it opened for analogy\r\nand illustration; giving them thus, on every subject, a larger view and\r\na broader range, as well for discussion as for the government of their\r\nown conduct.\r\n\r\nLiterature sometimes disgusts, and pretension to it much oftener\r\ndisgusts, by appearing to hang loosely on the character, like something\r\nforeign or extraneous, not a part, but an ill-adjusted appendage; or by\r\nseeming to overload and weigh it down by its unsightly bulk, like the\r\nproductions of bad taste in architecture, where there is massy and\r\ncumbrous ornament without strength or solidity of column. This has\r\nexposed learning, and especially classical learning, to reproach. Men\r\nhave seen that it might exist without mental superiority, without vigor,\r\nwithout good taste, and without utility. But in such cases classical\r\nlearning has only not inspired natural talent; or, at most, it has but\r\nmade original feebleness of intellect, and natural bluntness of\r\nperception, something more conspicuous. The question, after all, if it\r\nbe a question, is, whether literature, ancient as well as modern, does\r\nnot assist a good understanding, improve natural good taste, add\r\npolished armor to native strength, and render its possessor, not only\r\nmore capable of deriving private happiness from contemplation and\r\nreflection, but more accomplished also for action in the affairs of\r\nlife, and especially for public action. Those whose memories we now\r\nhonor were learned men; but their learning was kept in its proper place,\r\nand made subservient to the uses and objects of life. They were\r\nscholars, not common nor superficial; but their scholarship was so in\r\nkeeping with their character, so blended and inwrought, that careless\r\nobservers, or bad judges, not seeing an ostentatious display of it,\r\nmight infer that it did not exist; forgetting, or not knowing, that\r\nclassical learning in men who act in conspicuous public stations,\r\nperform duties which exercise the faculty of writing, or address\r\npopular, deliberative, or judicial bodies, is often felt where it is\r\nlittle seen, and sometimes felt more effectually because it is not seen\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nBut the cause of knowledge, in a more enlarged sense, the cause of\r\ngeneral knowledge and of popular education, had no warmer friends, nor\r\nmore powerful advocates, than Mr. Adams and Mr. Jefferson. On this\r\nfoundation they knew the whole republican system rested; and this great\r\nand all-important truth they strove to impress, by all the means in\r\ntheir power. In the early publication already referred to, Mr. Adams\r\nexpresses the strong and just sentiment, that the education of the poor\r\nis more important, even to the rich themselves, than all their own\r\nriches. On this great truth, indeed, is founded that unrivalled, that\r\ninvaluable political and moral institution, our own blessing and the\r\nglory of our fathers, the New England system of free schools.\r\n\r\nAs the promotion of knowledge had been the object of their regard\r\nthrough life, so these great men made it the subject of their\r\ntestamentary bounty. Mr. Jefferson is understood to have bequeathed his\r\nlibrary to the University of Virginia, and that of Mr. Adams is bestowed\r\non the inhabitants of Quincy.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams and Mr. Jefferson, fellow-citizens, were successively\r\nPresidents of the United States. The comparative merits of their\r\nrespective administrations for a long time agitated and divided public\r\nopinion. They were rivals, each supported by numerous and powerful\r\nportions of the people, for the highest office. This contest, partly\r\nthe cause and partly the consequence of the long existence of two great\r\npolitical parties in the country, is now part of the history of our\r\ngovernment. We may naturally regret that any thing should have\r\noccurred to create difference and discord between those who had\r\nacted harmoniously and efficiently in the great concerns of the\r\nRevolution. But this is not the time, nor this the occasion, for\r\nentering into the grounds of that difference, or for attempting to\r\ndiscuss the merits of the questions which it involves. As practical\r\nquestions, they were canvassed when the measures which they regarded\r\nwere acted on and adopted; and as belonging to history, the time has\r\nnot come for their consideration.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, not wonderful, that, when the Constitution of the United\r\nStates first went into operation, different opinions should be\r\nentertained as to the extent of the powers conferred by it. Here was a\r\nnatural source of diversity of sentiment. It is still less wonderful,\r\nthat that event, nearly contemporary with our government under the\r\npresent Constitution, which so entirely shocked all Europe, and\r\ndisturbed our relations with her leading powers, should be thought, by\r\ndifferent men, to have different bearings on our own prosperity; and\r\nthat the early measures adopted by the government of the United States,\r\nin consequence of this new state of things, should be seen in opposite\r\nlights. It is for the future historian, when what now remains of\r\nprejudice and misconception shall have passed away, to state these\r\ndifferent opinions, and pronounce impartial judgment. In the mean time,\r\nall good men rejoice, and well may rejoice, that the sharpest\r\ndifferences sprung out of measures which, whether right or wrong, have\r\nceased with the exigencies that gave them birth, and have left no\r\npermanent effect, either on the Constitution or on the general\r\nprosperity of the country. This remark, I am aware, may be supposed to\r\nhave its exception in one measure, the alteration of the Constitution as\r\nto the mode of choosing President; but it is true in its general\r\napplication. Thus the course of policy pursued towards France in 1798,\r\non the one hand, and the measures of commercial restriction commenced in\r\n1807, on the other, both subjects of warm and severe opposition, have\r\npassed away and left nothing behind them. They were temporary, and\r\nwhether wise or unwise, their consequences were limited to their\r\nrespective occasions. It is equally clear, at the same time, and it is\r\nequally gratifying, that those measures of both administrations which\r\nwere of durable importance, and which drew after them momentous and long\r\nremaining consequences, have received general approbation. Such was the\r\norganization, or rather the creation, of the navy, in the administration\r\nof Mr. Adams; such the acquisition of Louisiana, in that of Mr.\r\nJefferson. The country, it may safely be added, is not likely to be\r\nwilling either to approve, or to reprobate, indiscriminately, and in the\r\naggregate, all the measures of either, or of any, administration. The\r\ndictate of reason and of justice is, that, holding each one his own\r\nsentiments on the points of difference, we imitate the great men\r\nthemselves in the forbearance and moderation which they have cherished,\r\nand in the mutual respect and kindness which they have been so much\r\ninclined to feel and to reciprocate.\r\n\r\nNo men, fellow-citizens, ever served their country with more entire\r\nexemption from every imputation of selfish and mercenary motives, than\r\nthose to whose memory we are paying these proofs of respect. A\r\nsuspicion of any disposition to enrich themselves, or to profit by their\r\npublic employments, never rested on either. No sordid motive approached\r\nthem. The inheritance which they have left to their children is of their\r\ncharacter and their fame.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, I will detain you no longer by this faint and feeble\r\ntribute to the memory of the illustrious dead. Even in other hands,\r\nadequate justice could not be done to them, within the limits of this\r\noccasion. Their highest, their best praise, is your deep conviction of\r\ntheir merits, your affectionate gratitude for their labors and their\r\nservices. It is not my voice, it is this cessation of ordinary pursuits,\r\nthis arresting of all attention, these solemn ceremonies, and this\r\ncrowded house, which speak their eulogy. Their fame, indeed, is safe.\r\nThat is now treasured up beyond the reach of accident. Although no\r\nsculptured marble should rise to their memory, nor engraved stone bear\r\nrecord of their deeds, yet will their remembrance be as lasting as the\r\nland they honored. Marble columns may, indeed, moulder into dust, time\r\nmay erase all impress from the crumbling stone, but their fame remains;\r\nfor with AMERICAN LIBERTY it rose, and with AMERICAN LIBERTY ONLY Can it\r\nperish. It was the last swelling peal of yonder choir, \"THEIR BODIES ARE\r\nBURIED IN PEACE, BUT THEIR NAME LIVETH EVERMORE.\" I catch that solemn\r\nsong, I echo that lofty strain of funeral triumph, \"THEIR NAME LIVETH\r\nEVERMORE.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the illustrious signers of the Declaration of Independence there now\r\nremains only CHARLES CARROLL. He seems an aged oak, standing alone on\r\nthe plain, which time has spared a little longer after all its\r\ncontemporaries have been levelled with the dust. Venerable object! we\r\ndelight to gather round its trunk, while yet it stands, and to dwell\r\nbeneath its shadow. Sole survivor of an assembly of as great men as the\r\nworld has witnessed, in a transaction one of the most important that\r\nhistory records, what thoughts, what interesting reflections, must fill\r\nhis elevated and devout soul! If he dwell on the past, how touching its\r\nrecollections; if he survey the present, how happy, how joyous, how full\r\nof the fruition of that hope, which his ardent patriotism indulged; if\r\nhe glance at the future, how does the prospect of his country's\r\nadvancement almost bewilder his weakened conception Fortunate,\r\ndistinguished patriot! Interesting relic of the past! Let him know that,\r\nwhile we honor the dead, we do not forget the living; and that there is\r\nnot a heart here which does not fervently pray, that Heaven may keep him\r\nyet back from the society of his companions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now, fellow-citizens, let us not retire from this occasion without a\r\ndeep and solemn conviction of the duties which have devolved upon us.\r\nThis lovely land, this glorious liberty, these benign institutions, the\r\ndear purchase of our fathers, are ours; ours to enjoy, ours to preserve,\r\nours to transmit. Generations past and generations to come hold us\r\nresponsible for this sacred trust. Our fathers, from behind, admonish\r\nus, with their anxious paternal voices; posterity calls out to us, from\r\nthe bosom of the future; the world turns hither its solicitous eyes;\r\nall, all conjure us to act wisely, and faithfully, in the relation which\r\nwe sustain. We can never, indeed, pay the debt which is upon us; but by\r\nvirtue, by morality, by religion, by the cultivation of every good\r\nprinciple and every good habit, we may hope to enjoy the blessing,\r\nthrough our day, and to leave it unimpaired to our children. Let us feel\r\ndeeply how much of what we are and of what we possess we owe to this\r\nliberty, and to these institutions of government. Nature has, indeed,\r\ngiven us a soil which yields bounteously to the hand of industry, the\r\nmighty and fruitful ocean is before us, and the skies over our heads\r\nshed health and vigor. But what are lands, and seas, and skies, to\r\ncivilized man, without society, without knowledge, without morals,\r\nwithout religious culture; and how can these be enjoyed, in all their\r\nextent and all their excellence, but under the protection of wise\r\ninstitutions and a free government? Fellow-citizens, there is not one of\r\nus, there is not one of us here present, who does not, at this moment,\r\nand at every moment, experience, in his own condition, and in the\r\ncondition of those most near and dear to him, the influence and the\r\nbenefits of this liberty and these institutions. Let us then acknowledge\r\nthe blessing, let us feel it deeply and powerfully, let us cherish a\r\nstrong affection for it, and resolve to maintain and perpetuate it. The\r\nblood of our fathers, let it not have been shed in vain; the great hope\r\nof posterity, let it not be blasted.\r\n\r\nThe striking attitude, too, in which we stand to the world around us, a\r\ntopic to which, I fear, I advert too often, and dwell on too long,\r\ncannot be altogether omitted here. Neither individuals nor nations can\r\nperform their part well, until they understand and feel its importance,\r\nand comprehend and justly appreciate all the duties belonging to it.\r\nIt is not to inflate national vanity, nor to swell a light and empty\r\nfeeling of self-importance, but it is that we may judge justly of our\r\nsituation, and of our own duties, that I earnestly urge upon you this\r\nconsideration of our position and our character among the nations of\r\nthe earth. It cannot be denied, but by those who would dispute\r\nagainst the sun, that with America, and in America, a new era commences\r\nin human affairs. This era is distinguished by free representative\r\ngovernments, by entire religious liberty, by improved systems of\r\nnational intercourse, by a newly awakened and an unconquerable spirit of\r\nfree inquiry, and by a diffusion of knowledge through the community,\r\nsuch as has been before altogether unknown and unheard of. America,\r\nAmerica, our country, fellow-citizens, our own dear and native land, is\r\ninseparably connected, fast bound up, in fortune and by fate, with\r\nthese great interests. If they fall, we fall with them; if they stand,\r\nit will be because we have maintained them. Let us contemplate, then,\r\nthis connection, which binds the prosperity of others to our own; and\r\nlet us manfully discharge all the duties which it imposes. If we cherish\r\nthe virtues and the principles of our fathers, Heaven will assist us to\r\ncarry on the work of human liberty and human happiness. Auspicious\r\nomens cheer us. Great examples are before us. Our own firmament now\r\nshines brightly upon our path. WASHINGTON is in the clear, upper sky.\r\nThese other stars have now joined the American constellation; they\r\ncircle round their centre, and the heavens beam with new light.\r\nBeneath this illumination let us walk the course of life, and at its\r\nclose devoutly commend our beloved country, the common parent of us all,\r\nto the Divine Benignity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [67] A Discourse in Commemoration of the Lives and Services of John\r\n        Adams and Thomas Jefferson, delivered in Faneuil Hall, Boston,\r\n        on the 2d of August, 1826.\r\n\r\n   [68] Hon.

It\r\n        looks likely to me; for, if we can remove the turbulent Gallics,\r\n        our people, according to the exactest computations, will, in\r\n        another century, become more numerous than England itself.\r\n        Should this be the case, since we have, I may say, all the naval\r\n        stores of the nation in our hands, it will be easy to obtain a\r\n        mastery of the seas; and then the united force of all Europe\r\n        will not be able to subdue us. The only way to keep us from\r\n        setting up for ourselves is to disunite us.\r\n\r\n        \"Be not surprised that I am turned politician. This whole town\r\n        is immersed in politics. The interests of nations, and all the\r\n        dira of war, make the subject of every conversation. I sit and\r\n        hear, and after having been led through a maze of sage\r\n        observations, I sometimes retire, and, laying things together,\r\n        form some reflections pleasing to myself. The produce of one of\r\n        these reveries you have read above.\"\r\n\r\n   [70] Nearly all that was known of this celebrated argument, at the time\r\n        the present Discourse was delivered, was derived from the\r\n        recollections of John Adams, as preserved in Minot's History of\r\n        Massachusetts, Vol. II. p. 91.

The argument of the House is in the form of\r\n        an answer to the Governor's Message, and was reported by Mr.\r\n        Samuel Adams, Mr. Hancock, Mr. Hawley, Mr. Bowers, Mr. Hobson,\r\n        Mr. Foster, Mr. Phillips, and Mr. Thayer. As the power of the\r\n        Parliament had been acknowledged, so far at least as to affect\r\n        us by laws of trade, it was not easy to settle the line of\r\n        distinction. It was thought, however, to be very clear, that the\r\n        charters of the Colonies had exempted them from the general\r\n        legislation of the British Parliament. See Massachusetts State\r\n        Papers, p. 351. The important assistance rendered by John Adams\r\n        in the preparation of the answer of the House to the Message of\r\n        the Governor may be learned from the Life and Works of John\r\n        Adams, Vol. II. p. 311 _et seq._\r\n\r\n   [75] The official copy of the Declaration, as engrossed and signed by\r\n        the members of Congress, is framed and preserved in the Hall\r\n        over the Patent-Office at Washington.\r\n\r\n   [76] See Life and Works of John Adams, Vol. II. p. 417 _et seq._\r\n\r\n   [77] On the authorship of this speech, see Note at the end of the\r\n        Discourse.\r\n\r\n   [78] In this Convention he served as chairman of the committee for\r\n        preparing the draft of a Constitution.\r\n\r\n   [79] Upon the organization of this body, 15th November, 1820, John\r\n        Adams was elected its President; an office which the infirmities\r\n        of age compelled him to decline. For the interesting proceedings\r\n        of the Convention on this occasion, the address of Chief Justice\r\n        Parker, and the reply of Mr. Adams, see Journal of Debates and\r\n        Proceedings in the Convention of Delegates chosen to revise the\r\n        Constitution of Massachusetts, p. 8 _et seq._\r\n\r\n   [80] For an account of Mr. Webster's last interview with Mr. Adams, see\r\n        March's Reminiscences of Congress, p. 62.\r\n\r\n   [81] Mr. Jefferson himself considered his services in establishing the\r\n        University of Virginia as among the most important rendered by\r\n        him to the country. In Mr. Wirt's Eulogy, it is stated that a\r\n        private memorandum was found among his papers, containing the\r\n        following inscription to be placed on his monument:--\"Here was\r\n        buried Thomas Jefferson, Author of the Declaration of\r\n        Independence, of the Statutes of Virginia for Religious Freedom,\r\n        and Father of the University of Virginia.\" Eulogies on Adams and\r\n        Jefferson, p. 426.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPage 136.\r\n\r\nThe question has often been asked, whether the anonymous speech against\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, and the speech in support of it\r\nascribed to John Adams in the preceding Discourse, are a portion of the\r\ndebates which actually took place in 1776 in the Continental Congress.\r\nNot only has this inquiry been propounded in the public papers, but\r\nseveral letters on the subject have been addressed to Mr. Webster and\r\nhis friends. For this reason, it may be proper to state, that those\r\nspeeches were composed by Mr. Webster, after the manner of the ancient\r\nhistorians, as embodying in an impressive form the arguments relied upon\r\nby the friends and opponents of the measure, respectively. They of\r\ncourse represent the speeches that were actually made on both sides, but\r\nno report of the debates of this period has been preserved, and the\r\norator on the present occasion had no aid in framing these addresses,\r\nbut what was furnished by general tradition and the known line of\r\nargument pursued by the speakers and writers of that day for and against\r\nthe measure of Independence. The first sentence of the speech ascribed\r\nto Mr. Adams was of course suggested by the parting scene with Jonathan\r\nSewall, as described by Mr. Adams himself, in the Preface to the Letters\r\nof Novanglus and Massachusettensis.\r\n\r\nSo much interest has been taken in this subject, that it has been\r\nthought proper, by way of settling the question in the most authentic\r\nmanner, to give publicity to the following answer, written by Mr.\r\nWebster to one of the letters of inquiry above alluded to.\r\n\r\n  \"_Washington, 22 January, 1846._\r\n\r\n  \"DEAR SIR:--\r\n\r\n  \"I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the\r\n  18th instant. Its contents hardly surprise me, as I have received\r\n  very many similar communications.\r\n\r\n  \"Your inquiry is easily answered. The Congress of the Revolution sat\r\n  with closed doors. Its proceedings were made known to the public,\r\n  from time to time, by printing its journal; but the debates were not\r\n  published. So far as I know, there is not existing, in print or\r\n  manuscript, the speech, or any part or fragment of the speech,\r\n  delivered by Mr. Adams on the question of the Declaration of\r\n  Independence. We only know from the testimony of his auditors, that\r\n  he spoke with remarkable ability and characteristic earnestness.\r\n\r\n  \"The day after the Declaration was made, Mr. Adams, in writing to a\r\n  friend,[82] declared the event to be one that 'ought to be\r\n  commemorated, as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion\r\n  to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade,\r\n  with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations,\r\n  from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward,\r\n  for evermore.'\r\n\r\n  \"And on the day of his death, hearing the noise of bells and cannon,\r\n  he asked the occasion. On being reminded that it was 'Independent\r\n  day,' he replied, 'Independence for ever!' These expressions were\r\n  introduced into the speech _supposed_ to have been made by him. For\r\n  the rest, I must be answerable. The speech was written by me, in my\r\n  house in Boston, the day before the delivery of the Discourse in\r\n  Faneuil Hall; a poor substitute, I am sure it would appear to be, if\r\n  we could now see the speech actually made by Mr. Adams on that\r\n  transcendently important occasion.\r\n\r\n  \"I am, respectfully,\r\n  \"Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  \"DANIEL WEBSTER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [82] See Letters of John Adams to his Wife, Vol. I. p. 128, note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTION OF 1825.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has already been observed in the Introductory Memoir, that, from the\r\nreturn of peace in 1815, a tendency manifested itself in many parts of\r\nthe country toward a dissolution of the old parties. The overwrought\r\nfeelings of the people demanded repose. The subject-matter of several\r\nof the points of party dissension had expired with the war. New\r\nquestions of great public interest, traversing the old party lines, had\r\nsprung up. General Jackson, in a letter addressed to Mr. Monroe, in\r\n1817, on the subject of the formation of his cabinet, had advised him\r\nto discard the former party divisions. In the progress of his eight\r\nyears' administration, it was every day more and more apparent, that\r\nthe old party influences had spent their force. It became at last\r\nimpossible to recognize their continued existence.\r\n\r\nWith the approach of the national election in the autumn of 1824, at\r\nwhich four candidates were supported for the office of President, no\r\nthoughts were entertained in any quarter of recommending either of them\r\nas a candidate to be supported or opposed by one or the other of the\r\nancient parties. If there was any seeming departure from this principle,\r\nit must have been to some quite limited extent, and for supposed\r\nadvantage in narrow localities. In the Union at large, no such attempt\r\nwas made. The several candidates were sustained on broad national\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nThis was eminently the case in Massachusetts, where a very large\r\nmajority of the people, assuming the name of National Republicans, and\r\nwithout reference to former divisions, were united in the support of\r\ntheir fellow-citizen, John Quincy Adams. At the State elections next\r\nsucceeding his accession to the Presidency, in the spring of 1825, the\r\ncandidates for the offices of Governor and Lieutenant-Governor, who, at\r\nthe last contested election, had been brought forward by the Democratic\r\nparty, were almost unanimously supported, and a union ticket for\r\nSenators was nominated in most of the counties of the State. Such was\r\nthe case in Suffolk County; and at a meeting held in Faneuil Hall,\r\nwithout distinction of party, to ratify these nominations, the following\r\nremarks were made by Mr. Webster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTION OF 1825.[83]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Webster said, he was quite unaccustomed to appear in that place;\r\nhaving on no occasion addressed his fellow-citizens there, either to\r\nrecommend or to oppose the support of any candidates for public office.\r\nHe had long been of opinion, that to preserve the distinction and the\r\nhostility of political parties was not consistent with the highest\r\ndegree of public good. At the same time, he did not find fault with the\r\nconduct, nor question the motives, of those who thought otherwise. But,\r\nentertaining this opinion, he had habitually abstained from attending on\r\nthose occasions on which the merits of public men, and of candidates for\r\noffice, were discussed, necessarily with more or less reference to party\r\nattachment and party organization.\r\n\r\nThe present was an occasion of a different kind. The sentiment which had\r\ncalled this meeting together was one of union and conciliation; a\r\nsentiment so congenial to his own feelings, and to his opinion of the\r\npublic interest, that he could not resist the inclination to be present,\r\nand to express his entire and hearty concurrence.\r\n\r\nHe should forbear, he said, from all remarks upon the particular names\r\nwhich had been recommended by the committee. They had been selected, he\r\nmust presume, fairly, and with due consideration, by those who were\r\nappointed for that purpose. In cases of this sort, every one cannot\r\nexpect to find every thing precisely as he might wish it; but those who\r\nconcurred in the general sentiment which dictated the selection would\r\nnaturally allow that sentiment to prevail as far as possible over\r\nparticular objections.\r\n\r\nOn the general question he would make a few remarks, begging the\r\nindulgence of the meeting if he should say any thing which might with\r\nmore propriety proceed from others.\r\n\r\nHe hardly conceived how well disposed and intelligent minds could differ\r\nas to the question, whether party contest and party strife, organized,\r\nsystematic, and continued, were of themselves desirable ingredients in\r\nthe composition of society. Difference of opinion on political subjects,\r\nhonorable competition, and emulous rivalry, may indeed be useful. But\r\nthese are very different things from organized and systematic party\r\ncombinations. He admitted, it was true, that party associations were\r\nsometimes unavoidable, and perhaps necessary to the accomplishment of\r\nother ends and purposes. But this did not prove that, of themselves,\r\nthey were good; or that they should be continued and preserved for their\r\nown sake, when there had ceased to be any object to be effected by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut there were those who supposed, that, whether political party\r\ndistinctions were or were not useful, it was impossible to abolish them.\r\nNow he thought, on the contrary, that, under present circumstances, it\r\nwas quite impossible to continue them. New parties, indeed, might arise,\r\ngrowing out of new events or new questions; but as to those old parties\r\nwhich had sprung from controversies now no longer pending, or from\r\nfeelings which time and other causes had now changed, or greatly\r\nallayed, he did not believe that they could long remain. Efforts,\r\nindeed, made to that end, with zeal and perseverance, might delay their\r\nextinction, but, he thought, could not prevent it. There was nothing to\r\nkeep alive these distinctions in the interests and objects which now\r\nengaged society. New questions and new objects arise, having no\r\nconnection with the subjects of past controversies, and present interest\r\novercomes or absorbs the recollection of former controversies. Those who\r\nare united on these existing questions and present interests will not be\r\ndisposed to weaken their efforts to promote them, by angry reflections\r\non past differences. If there were nothing _in things_ to divide about,\r\nhe thought the people not likely to maintain systematic controversies\r\nabout _men_. They have no interest in so doing. Associations formed to\r\nsupport _principles_ may be called _parties_; but if they have no bond\r\nof union but adherence to particular _men_, they become _factions_.\r\n\r\nThe people, in his opinion, were at present grateful to all parties for\r\nwhatever of good they had accomplished, and indulgent to all for\r\nwhatever of error they had committed; and, with these feelings, were now\r\nmainly intent on the great objects which affected their present\r\ninterests. There might be exceptions to this remark; he was afraid there\r\nwere; but, nevertheless, such appeared to him to be the general feeling\r\nin the country. It was natural that some prejudices should remain longer\r\nthan their causes, as the waves lash the shore for a time after the\r\nstorm has subsided; but the tendency of the elements was to repose.\r\nMonopolies of all sorts were getting out of fashion; they were yielding\r\nto liberal ideas, and to the obvious justice and expediency of fair\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nAn administration of the general government, which had been in general\r\nhighly satisfactory to the country, had now closed.[84] He was not aware\r\nthat it could with propriety be said, that that administration had been\r\neither supported or opposed by any party associations or on any party\r\nprinciples. Certain it was, that, as far as there had been any organized\r\nopposition to the administration, it had had nothing to do with former\r\nparties. A new administration had now commenced, and he need hardly say\r\nthat the most liberal and conciliatory principles had been avowed in the\r\nInaugural Address of the newly elected President. It could not be\r\ndoubted that his administration would conform to those principles. Thus\r\nfar, he believed, its course had given general satisfaction. After what\r\nthey all had seen in relation to the gentleman holding the highest\r\nappointment in the executive department under the President, he would\r\ntake this opportunity to say, that, having been a member of the House of\r\nRepresentatives for six years, during the greater part of which time Mr.\r\nClay had presided in that House, he was most happy in being able, in a\r\nmanner less formal and more explicit than by concurring in the usual\r\nvote of thanks, to express his own opinion of his liberality,\r\nindependence, and honorable feeling. And he would take this occasion\r\nalso to add, if his opinion could be of any value in such a case, that\r\nhe thought nothing more unfounded than that that gentleman owed his\r\npresent situation to any unworthy compromise or arrangement whatever.\r\nHe owed it to his talent, to his prominent standing in the community, to\r\nhis course of public service, not now a short one, and to the high\r\nestimation in which he stands with that part of the country to which he\r\nbelongs.\r\n\r\nRemarks, Mr. Webster proceeded to say, had been made from the chair,\r\nvery kind and partial, as to the manner in which he had discharged\r\nthe duties which he owed to his constituents in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. He wished to say, that if he had been able to render\r\nany, the humblest services, either to the public or his constituents,\r\nin that place, it was owing wholly to the liberal manner in which his\r\nefforts there had been received.\r\n\r\nHaving alluded to the Inaugural Address, he did not mean in the\r\nslightest degree to detract from its merits, when he now said, that, in\r\nhis opinion, if either of the other candidates had succeeded in the\r\nelection, he also would have adopted a liberal course of policy. He had\r\nno reason to believe that the sentiments of either of those gentlemen\r\nwere, in this respect, narrow or contracted. He fully believed the\r\ncontrary, in regard to both of them; but if they had been otherwise, he\r\nthought still that expediency or necessity would have controlled their\r\ninclinations.\r\n\r\nI forbear, said Mr. Webster, from pursuing these remarks farther. I\r\nrepeat, that I do not complain of those who have hitherto thought, or\r\nwho still think, that party organization is necessary to the public\r\ngood. I do not question their motives; and I wish to be tolerant even to\r\nthose who think that toleration ought not to be indulged.\r\n\r\nIt is said, Sir, that prosperity sometimes hardens the heart.\r\nPerhaps, also, it may sometimes have a contrary effect, and elevate\r\nand liberalize the feelings. If this can ever be the result of such\r\na cause, there is certainly in the present condition of the country\r\nenough to inspire the most grateful and the kindest feelings. We have a\r\ncommon stock both of happiness and of distinction, of which we are\r\nall entitled, as citizens of the country, to partake. We may all\r\nrejoice in the general prosperity, in the peace and security which\r\nwe enjoy, and in the brilliant success which has thus far attended our\r\nrepublican institutions. These are circumstances which may well excite\r\nin us all a noble pride. Our civil and political institutions, while\r\nthey answer for us all the great ends designed by them, furnish at\r\nthe same time an example to others, and diffuse blessings beyond our\r\nown limits. In whatever part of the globe men are found contending for\r\npolitical liberty, they look to the United States with a feeling of\r\nbrotherhood, and put forth a claim of kindred. The South American\r\nstates, especially, exhibit a most interesting spectacle. Let the\r\ngreat men who formed our constitutions of government, who still\r\nsurvive, and let the children of those who have gone to their graves,\r\nconsole themselves with the reflection, that, whether they have risen or\r\nfallen in the little contests of party, they have not only established\r\nthe liberty and happiness of their own native land, but have\r\nconferred blessings beyond their own country, and beyond their own\r\nthoughts, on millions of men and on successions of generations. Under\r\nthe influence of these institutions, received and adopted in principle\r\nfrom our example, the whole southern continent has shaken off its\r\ncolonial subjection. A new world, filled with fresh and interesting\r\nnations, has risen to our sight. America seems again discovered; not to\r\ngeography, but to commerce, to social intercourse, to intelligence, to\r\ncivilization, and to liberty. Fifty years ago, some of those who now\r\nhear me, and the fathers of many others, listened in this place to\r\nthose mighty leaders, Otis and Adams. When they then uttered the\r\nspirit-stirring sounds of Independence and Liberty, there was not a foot\r\nof land on the continent, inhabited by civilized man, that did not\r\nacknowledge the dominion of European power. Thank God, at this moment,\r\nfrom this place to the south pole, and from sea to sea, there is hardly\r\na foot of land that does.\r\n\r\nAnd, Sir, when these states, thus newly disenthralled and emancipated,\r\nassume the tone and bear the port of independence, what language and\r\nwhat ideas do we find associated with their newly acquired liberty? They\r\nspeak, Sir, of constitutions, of declarations of rights, of the liberty\r\nof the press, of a congress, and of representative government. Where,\r\nSir, did they learn these? And when they have applied to their great\r\nleader, and the founder of their states, the language of praise and\r\ncommendation till they have exhausted it, when unsatisfied gratitude can\r\nexpress itself no otherwise, do they not call him their WASHINGTON? Sir,\r\nthe Spirit of Continental Independence, the Genius of American Liberty,\r\nwhich in earlier times tried her infant voice in the halls and on the\r\nhills of New England, utters it now, with power that seems to wake the\r\ndead, on the plains of Mexico, and along the sides of the Andes.\r\n\r\n  \"Her path, where'er the goddess roves,\r\n  Glory pursues, and generous shame,\r\n  The unconquerable mind, and Freedom's holy flame.\"\r\n\r\nThere is one other point of view, Sir, in regard to which I will say a\r\nfew words, though perhaps at some hazard of misinterpretation.\r\n\r\nIn the wonderful spirit of improvement and enterprise which animates the\r\ncountry, we may be assured that each quarter will naturally exert its\r\npower in favor of objects in which it is interested. This is natural and\r\nunavoidable. Each portion, therefore, will use its best means. If the\r\nWest feels a strong interest in clearing the navigation of its mighty\r\nstreams, and opening roads through its vast forests, if the South is\r\nequally zealous to push the production and augment the prices of its\r\ngreat staples, it is reasonable to expect that these objects will be\r\npursued by the best means which offer themselves. And it may therefore\r\nwell deserve consideration, whether the commercial and navigating and\r\nmanufacturing interests of the North do not call on us to aid and\r\nsupport them, by united counsels and united efforts. But I abstain from\r\nenlarging on this topic. Let me rather say, that in regard to the whole\r\ncountry a new era has arisen. In a time of peace, the proper pursuits of\r\npeace engage society with a degree of enterprise and an intenseness of\r\napplication heretofore unknown. New objects are opening, and new\r\nresources developed, on every side. We tread on a broader theatre; and\r\nif, instead of acting our parts according to the novelty and importance\r\nof the scene, we waste our strength in mutual crimination and\r\nrecrimination concerning the past, we shall resemble those navigators,\r\nwho, having escaped from some crooked and narrow river to the sea, now\r\nthat the whole ocean is before them, should, nevertheless, occupy\r\nthemselves with the differences which happened as they passed along\r\namong the rocks and the shallows, instead of opening their eyes to the\r\nwide horizon around them, spreading their sail to the propitious gale\r\nthat woos it, raising their quadrant to the sun, and grasping the helm\r\nwith the conscious hand of a master.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [83] Speech delivered at a Meeting of Citizens of Boston, held in\r\n        Fatima Hall on the Evening of April 3d, 1825, preparatory to the\r\n        General Election in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n   [84] That of President Monroe, which commenced on the 4th of March,\r\n        1817, and continued for two terms, till the 4th of March, 1825.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDINNER AT FANEUIL HALL.\r\n\r\n  At a public dinner given him on the 5th of June, 1828, by the\r\n  citizens of Boston (Hon. T. H. Perkins in the chair), as a mark of\r\n  respect for his services as Senator of the United States, and late\r\n  their Representative in Congress, after the annunciation of the\r\n  following toast, \"Our distinguished guest,--worthy the noblest\r\n  homage which freemen can give or a freeman receive, the homage of\r\n  their hearts,\" Mr. Webster rose and spoke as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN,--The honor conferred by this occasion, as well as the\r\nmanner in which the meeting has been pleased to receive the toast which\r\nhas now been proposed to them from the chair, requires from me a most\r\nrespectful acknowledgment and a few words of honest and sincere thanks.\r\nI should, indeed, be lost to all just feeling, or guilty of a weak and\r\npuerile affectation, if I should fail to manifest the emotions which are\r\nexcited by these testimonials of regard, from those among whom I live,\r\nwho see me oftenest, and know me best. If the approbation of good men be\r\nan object fit to be pursued, it is fit to be enjoyed; if it be, as it\r\ndoubtless is, one of the most stirring and invigorating motives which\r\noperate upon the mind, it is also among the richest rewards which\r\nconsole and gratify the heart.\r\n\r\nI confess myself particularly touched and affected, Mr. President and\r\nGentlemen, by the kind feeling which you manifest towards me as your\r\nfellow-citizen, your neighbor, and your friend. Respect and confidence,\r\nin these relations of life, lie at the foundation of all valuable\r\ncharacter; they are as essential to solid and permanent reputation as to\r\ndurable and social happiness. I assure you, Sir, with the utmost\r\nsincerity, that there is nothing which could flow from human approbation\r\nand applause, no distinction, however high or alluring, no object of\r\nambition, which could possibly be brought within the horizon of my view,\r\nthat would tempt me, in any degree, justly to forfeit the attachment of\r\nmy private friends, or surrender my hold, as a citizen and a neighbor,\r\non the confidence of the community in which I live; a community to which\r\nI owe so much, in the bosom of which I have enjoyed so much, and where I\r\nstill hope to remain, in the interchange of mutual good wishes and the\r\nexercise of mutual good offices, for the residue of life.\r\n\r\nThe commendation bestowed by the meeting upon my attempts at public\r\nservice, I am conscious, is measured rather by their own kindness, than\r\nby any other standard. Of those attempts, no one can think more humbly\r\nthan I do. The affairs of the general government, foreign and domestic,\r\nare vast and various and complicated. They require from those who would\r\naspire to take a leading part in them an amount, a variety, and an\r\naccuracy of information, which, even if the adequate capacity were not\r\nwanting, are not easily attained by one whose attention is of necessity\r\nmainly devoted to the duties of an active and laborious profession. For\r\nthis as well as many other reasons, I am conscious of having discharged\r\nmy public duties in a manner no way entitling them to the degree of\r\nfavor which has now been manifested.\r\n\r\nAnd this manifestation of favor and regard is the more especially to be\r\nreferred to the candor and kindness of the meeting, on this occasion,\r\nsince it is well known, that in a recent instance, and in regard to an\r\nimportant measure, I have felt it my duty to give a vote, in respect to\r\nthe expediency and propriety of which considerable difference of opinion\r\nexists between persons equally entitled to my regard and confidence.[85]\r\nThe candid interpretation which has been given to that vote by those who\r\ndisapproved it, and the assembling together here, for the purposes of\r\nthis occasion, of those who felt pain, as well as those who felt\r\npleasure, at the success of the measure for which the vote was given,\r\nafford ample proof, how far unsuspected uprightness of intention and the\r\nexercise of an independent judgment may be respected, even by those who\r\ndiffer from the results to which that exercise of judgment has arrived.\r\nThere is no class of the community for whose interests I have ever\r\ncherished a more sincere regard, than that on whose pursuits some parts\r\nof the measure alluded to bear with great severity. They are satisfied,\r\nI hope, that, in supporting a measure in any degree injurious to them, I\r\nmust have been governed by other paramount reasons, satisfactory to my\r\nown conscience; and that the blow inflicted on their interests was felt\r\nby me almost as painfully and heavily as it could be by those on whom it\r\nimmediately fell. I am not now about to enter into the reason of that\r\nvote, or to explain the necessity under which I found myself placed, by\r\na most strange and unprecedented manner of legislation, of taking the\r\nevil of a public measure for the sake of its good; the good and the bad\r\nprovisions relating to different subjects, having not the slightest\r\nconnection with each other, yet yoked together, and kept together, for\r\nreasons and purposes which I need not state, as they have been boldly\r\navowed, and are now before the public.\r\n\r\nIt was my misfortune, Sir, on that occasion, to differ from my most\r\nestimable and worthy colleague;[86] and yet probably our difference was\r\nnot so broad as it might seem. We both saw in the measure something to\r\napprove, and something to disapprove. If it could have been left to us\r\nto mould and to frame it according to our opinions of what the good of\r\nthe country required, there would have been no diversity of judgment\r\nbetween us, as to what should have been retained and what rejected. The\r\nonly difference was, when the measure had assumed its final shape,\r\nwhether the good it contained so far preponderated over its acknowledged\r\nevil, as to justify the reception and support of the whole together. On\r\na point of this sort, and under circumstances such as those in which we\r\nwere placed, it is not strange that different minds should incline\r\ndifferent ways. It gives me great pleasure to bear testimony to the\r\nconstancy, the intelligence, and the conscious fidelity with which my\r\ncolleague discharged his public duty in reference to this subject. I am\r\nhappy also to have the opportunity of saying, that, if the bill had been\r\npresented to me in the form it was when it received a negative vote\r\nfrom the distinguished gentleman[87] who represents this Congressional\r\nDistrict, my own opinion of it would have entirely concurred with his,\r\nand I should have voted in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe meeting will indulge me with one further remark, before parting from\r\nthis subject. It is only the suggestion, that in the place I occupied I\r\nwas one of the representatives of the whole Commonwealth. I was not at\r\nliberty to look exclusively to the interests of the district in which I\r\nlive, and which I have heretofore had the high honor of representing. I\r\nwas to extend my view from Barnstable to Berkshire; to comprehend in it\r\na proper regard for all interests, and a proper respect for all\r\nopinions. Looking to the aggregate of all the interests of the\r\nCommonwealth, and regarding the general current of opinion, so far as\r\nthat was properly to be respected, I saw, at least I thought I saw, my\r\nduty to lie in the path which I pursued. The measure is adopted. Its\r\nconsequences, for good or evil, must be left to the results of\r\nexperience. In the mean time, I refer the propriety of the vote which I\r\ngave, with entire submission, and with the utmost cheerfulness also, to\r\nthe judgment of the good people of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nOn some other subjects, Mr. President, I had the good fortune to act in\r\nperfect unison with my colleague, and with every representative of the\r\nState. On one, especially, the success of which, I am sure, must have\r\ngratified every one who hears me. I could not, Sir, have met this\r\nassembly, I could not have raised my voice in Faneuil Hall,--you would\r\nhave awed me down; if you had not, the portraits of patriots which adorn\r\nthese walls would have frowned me into silence,--if I had refused either\r\nmy vote or my voice to the cause of the officers and soldiers of the\r\nRevolutionary army. That measure, mixed up of justice, and charity, and\r\nmercy, is at last accomplished. The survivors of those who fought our\r\nRevolutionary battles, under an engagement to see the contest through,\r\nare at length provided for, not sumptuously, not extravagantly, but in a\r\nmanner to place them, in their old age, beyond the reach of absolute\r\nwant. Solace, also, has been administered to their feelings, as well as\r\nto their necessities. They are not left to count their scars, or to\r\nexperience the pain of wounds, inflicted half a century ago, in their\r\ncountry's service, without some token, that they are yet held in\r\ngrateful remembrance. A gratifying proof of respect for the services of\r\ntheir youth and manhood quickens the pulsations of patriotism in veteran\r\nbosoms; and as they may now live beyond the reach of absolute want, so\r\nthey will have the pleasure of closing life, when that time for closing\r\nit shall come which must come to all, with the happy consciousness of\r\nmeritorious services, gratefully recompensed.\r\n\r\nAnother subject, now becoming exceedingly interesting, was, in various\r\nforms, presented to Congress at the last session; and in regard to\r\nwhich, I believe, there is, substantially, a general union of opinion\r\namong the members from this Commonwealth; I mean what is commonly called\r\nInternal Improvements. The great and growing importance of this subject\r\nmay, I hope, justify a few remarks relative to it on the present\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nIt was evident to all persons of much observation, at the close of the\r\nlate war, that the condition and prospects of the United States had\r\nbecome essentially changed, in regard to sundry great interests of the\r\ncountry. Almost from the formation of the government, till near the\r\ncommencement of that war, the United States had occupied a position of\r\nsingular and extraordinary advantage. They had been at peace, while the\r\npowers of Europe had been at war. The harvest of neutrality had been to\r\nthem rich and ample; and they had reaped it with skill and diligence.\r\nTheir agriculture and commerce had both sensibly felt the benefit\r\narising from the existing state of the world. Bread was raised for those\r\nwhose hands were otherwise employed than in the cultivation of the\r\nfield, and the seas were navigated, for account of such as, being\r\nbelligerents, could not safely navigate them for themselves. These\r\nopportunities for useful employment were all seized and enjoyed, by the\r\nenterprise of the country; and a high degree of prosperity was the\r\nnatural result.\r\n\r\nBut with general peace a new state of things arose. The European states\r\nat once turned their own attention to the pursuits proper for their new\r\nsituation, and sought to extend their own agricultural, manufacturing,\r\nand commercial interests. It was evident, that thenceforward, instead of\r\nour enjoying the advantages peculiar to neutrality in times of war, a\r\ngeneral competition would spring up, and nothing was to be expected\r\nwithout a struggle. Other nations would now raise their own bread, and\r\nas far as possible transport their own commodities; and the export trade\r\nand the carrying trade of this country were, therefore, certain to\r\nbecome the subjects of new and powerful competition, if not to receive\r\nsudden and violent checks. It seemed reasonable, therefore, in this\r\nstate of things, to turn our thoughts inwards; to search out the\r\nhitherto unexplored resources of our own country; to find, if we could,\r\nnew diversifications of industry and new subjects for the application of\r\nlabor at home. It was fit to consider how far home productions could\r\nproperly be made to furnish activity to home supply; and since the\r\ncountry stretched over so many parallels of latitude and longitude,\r\nabounding, of course, in the natural productions proper to each, it was\r\nof the highest importance to inquire what means existed of establishing\r\nfree and cheap intercourse between those distant parts, thereby bringing\r\nthe raw material, abounding in one, under the action of the productive\r\nlabor which was found in another. Roads and canals, therefore, were seen\r\nto be of the first consequence. And then the interesting question arose,\r\nhow far it was constitutionally lawful, and how far expedient, for the\r\ngeneral government to give aid and succor to the business of making\r\nroads and canals, in conjunction with the enterprise of individuals or\r\nof states. I am among those who have held the opinion, that, if any\r\nobject of that kind be of general and national importance, it is within\r\nthe scope of the powers of the government; though I admit it to be a\r\npower which should be exercised with very great care and discretion.\r\nCongress has power to _regulate_ commerce, both internal and external;\r\nand whatever might have been thought to be the literal interpretation of\r\nthese terms, we know the construction to have been, from the very first\r\nassembling of Congress, and by the very men who framed the Constitution,\r\nthat the regulation of commerce comprehended such measures as were\r\nnecessary for its support, its improvement, its advancement, and\r\njustified the expenditure of money for such purposes as the construction\r\nof piers, beacons, and light-houses, and the clearing out of harbors.\r\nInstances of this sort, in the application of the general revenues, have\r\nbeen frequent, from the commencement of the government. As the same\r\npower, precisely, exists in relation to internal as to external trade,\r\nit was not easy to see why like expenditures might not be justified,\r\nwhen made on internal objects. The vast regions of the West are\r\npenetrated by rivers, to which those of Europe are but as rills and\r\nbrooks. But the navigation of these noble streams, washing, as they do,\r\nthe margin of one third of the States of the Union, is obstructed by\r\nobstacles, capable of being removed, and yet not likely to be removed,\r\nbut by the power of the general government. Was this a justifiable\r\nobject of expenditure from the national treasury? Without hesitation, I\r\nhave thought it was. A vast chain of lakes, if it be not more proper to\r\ncall them a succession of inland seas, stretches into the deep interior\r\nof this northern part of the continent, as if kindly placed there by\r\nProvidence to break the continuity of the land, and afford the easier\r\nand reader intercourse of water conveyance. But these vast lakes\r\nrequired, also, harbors, and light-houses, and breakwaters. And were\r\nthese lawful objects of national legislation? To me, certainly, they\r\nhave appeared to be such, as clearly as if they were on the Atlantic\r\nborder.\r\n\r\nIn most of the new States of the West, the United States are yet\r\nproprietors of vast bodies of land. Through some of these States, and\r\nsometimes through these same public lands, the local authorities have\r\nprepared to carry expensive canals, for the general benefit of the\r\ncountry. Some of these undertakings have been attended with great\r\nexpense, and have subjected the States, whose enterprising spirit has\r\nbegun and carried them on, to large debts and heavy taxation. The lands\r\nof the United States, being exempted from all taxation, of course bear\r\nno part of this burden. Looking to the United States, therefore, as a\r\ngreat landed proprietor, essentially benefited by these improvements, I\r\nhave felt no difficulty in voting for the appropriation of parts of\r\nthese lands, as a reasonable contribution by the United States to these\r\ngeneral objects.\r\n\r\nMost of the subjects to which I have referred are much less local, in\r\ntheir influence and importance, than they might seem. The breakwater in\r\nthe Delaware, useful to Philadelphia, is useful also to all the\r\nship-owners in the United States, and indeed to all interested in\r\ncommerce, especially that great branch, the coastwise commerce. If the\r\nmouths of the Southern rivers be deepened and improved, the neighboring\r\ncities are benefited, but so also are the ships which visit them; and if\r\nthe Mississippi and Ohio be rendered more safe for navigation, the great\r\nmarkets of consumption along their shores are the more readily and\r\ncheaply approached by the products of the factories and fisheries of New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion, Mr. President, that the present government of the\r\nUnited States cannot be maintained but by administering it on principles\r\nas wide and broad as the country over which it extends. I mean, of\r\ncourse, no extension of the powers which it confers; but I speak of the\r\nspirit with which those powers should be exercised. If there be any\r\ndoubts, whether so many republics, covering so vast a territory, can be\r\nlong held together under this Constitution, there is no doubt in my\r\njudgment of the impossibility of so holding them together by any narrow,\r\nlocal, or selfish system of legislation. To render the Constitution\r\nperpetual (which God grant it may be), it is necessary that its benefits\r\nshould be practically felt by all parts of the country, and all\r\ninterests in the country. The East and the West, the North and the\r\nSouth, must all see their own welfare protected and advanced by it.\r\nWhile the eastern frontier is defended by fortifications, its harbors\r\nimproved, and commerce protected by a naval force, it is right and just\r\nthat the region beyond the Alleghanies should receive fair consideration\r\nand equal attention, in any object of public improvement, interesting to\r\nitself, and within the proper power of the government. These, Sir, are\r\nin brief the general views by which I have been governed on questions of\r\nthis kind; and I trust they are such as this meeting does not\r\ndisapprove.\r\n\r\nI would not trespass further upon your attention, if I did not feel it\r\nmy duty to say a few words on the condition of public affairs under\r\nanother aspect. We are on the eve of a new election of President; and\r\nthe manner in which the existing administration is attacked might lead a\r\nstranger to suppose that the chief magistrate had committed some\r\nflagrant offence against the country, had threatened to overturn its\r\nliberties, or establish a military usurpation. On a former occasion I\r\nhave in this place expressed my opinion of the principle upon which the\r\nopposition to the administration is founded, without any reference\r\nwhatever to the person who stands as its apparent head, and who is\r\nintended by it to be placed in the chief executive chair. I think that\r\nprinciple exceedingly dangerous and alarming, inasmuch as it does not\r\nprofess to found opposition to the government on the measures of\r\ngovernment, but to rest it on other causes, and those mostly personal.\r\nThere is a combination or association of persons holding the most\r\nopposite opinions, both on the constitutional powers of the government\r\nand on the leading measures of public concern, and uniting in little, or\r\nin nothing, except the will to dislodge power from the hands in which\r\nthe country has placed it. There has been no leading measure of the\r\ngovernment, with perhaps a single exception, which has not been\r\nstrenuously maintained by many, or by some, of those who all cooeperate,\r\nnevertheless, in pursuit of the object which I have mentioned. This is\r\nbut one of many proofs that the opposition does not rest on the\r\nprinciple of disapprobation of the measures of government. Many other\r\nevidences of the same truth might be adduced easily. A remarkable one\r\nis, that, while one ground of objection to the administration is urged\r\nin one place, its precise opposite is pressed in another. Pennsylvania\r\nand South Carolina, for example, are not treated with the same reasons\r\nfor a change of administration; but with flatly contradictory reasons.\r\nIn one, the administration is represented as bent on a particular system\r\noppressive to that State, and which must ultimately ruin it; and for\r\nthat reason there ought to be a change. In the other, that system,\r\ninstead of being ruinous, is represented as salutary, as necessary, as\r\nindispensable. But the administration is declared to be but half in\r\nearnest in supporting it, and for that reason there ought to be a\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nReflecting men have always supposed, that, if there were a weak point in\r\nthe Federal Constitution, it was in the provision for the exercise of\r\nthe executive power. And this, perhaps, may be considered as rendered\r\nmore delicate and difficult, by the great augmentation of the number of\r\nthe States. We must expect that there will often be, as there was on the\r\nlast election, several candidates for the Presidency. All but one, of\r\ncourse, must be disappointed; and if the friends of all such, however\r\notherwise divided, are immediately to unite, and to make common cause\r\nagainst him who is elected, little is ever to be expected but\r\nembarrassment and confusion. The love of office will ere long triumph\r\nover the love of country, and party and faction usurp the place of\r\nwisdom and patriotism. If the contest for the executive power is thus to\r\nbe renewed every four years; if it is to be conducted as the present has\r\nbeen conducted; and if every election is to be immediately followed, as\r\nthe last was followed, by a prompt union of all whose friends are not\r\nchosen against him who is, there is, in my judgment, danger, much\r\ndanger, that this great experiment of confederated government may fail,\r\nand that even those of us who are not among the youngest may behold its\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nIt cannot have escaped the notice of any gentleman present, that, in the\r\ncourse of the controversy, pains have been taken to affect the character\r\nand the success of the present chief magistrate, by exciting odium\r\ntowards that part of the country in which he was born and to which he\r\nbelongs. Sneers, contumely, reproach, every thing that gentlemen could\r\nsay, and many things which gentlemen could not say, have been uttered\r\nagainst New England. I am sure, Sir, every true son of New England must\r\nreceive such things, when they come from sources which ought to be\r\nconsidered respectable, with a feeling of just indignation; and when\r\nproceeding from elsewhere, with contempt. If there be one among\r\nourselves who can be induced, by any motives, to join in this cry\r\nagainst New England, he disgraces the New England mother who bore him,\r\nthe New England father who bred and nurtured him, and the New England\r\natmosphere which first supplied respiration to those lungs, now so\r\nunworthily employed in uttering calumnies against his country. Persons\r\nnot known till yesterday, and having little chance of being remembered\r\nbeyond to-morrow, have affected to draw a distinction between the\r\npatriot States and the States of New England; assigning the last to the\r\npresent President, and the rest to his rival. I do not wonder, Sir, at\r\nthe indignation and scorn which I perceive the recital of this injustice\r\nproduces here. Nothing else was to be expected. Faneuil Hall is not a\r\nplace where one is expected to hear with indifference that New England\r\nis not to be counted among the patriot States. The patriot States! What\r\nState was it, Sir, that was patriotic when patriotism cost something?\r\nWhere but in New England did the great drama of the Revolution open?\r\nWhere, but on the soil of Massachusetts, was the first blood poured out\r\nin the cause of liberty and independence? Where, sooner than here, where\r\nearlier than within the walls which now surround us, was patriotism\r\nfound, when to be patriotic was to endanger houses and homes, and wives\r\nand children, and to be ready also to pay for the reputation of\r\npatriotism by the sacrifice of blood and of life?\r\n\r\nNot farther to refer to her Revolutionary merits, it may be truly said\r\nthat New England did her part, and more than her part, in the\r\nestablishment of the present government, and in giving effect to the\r\nmeasures and the policy of the first President. Where, Sir, did the\r\nmeasures of Washington find the most active friends and the firmest\r\nsupport? Where are the general principles of his policy most widely\r\nspread, and most deeply seated? If, in subsequent periods, different\r\nopinions have been held by different portions of her people, New England\r\nhas, nevertheless, been always obedient to the laws, even when she most\r\nseverely felt their pressure, and most conscientiously doubted or\r\ndisbelieved their propriety. Every great and permanent institution of\r\nthe country, intended for defence or for improvement, has met her\r\nsupport. And if we look to recent measures, on subjects highly\r\ninteresting to the community, and especially some portions of it, we see\r\nproofs of the same steady and liberal policy. It may be said with entire\r\ntruth, and it ought to be said, and ought to be known, that no one\r\nmeasure for internal improvement has been carried through Congress, or\r\ncould have been carried, but by the aid of New England votes. It is for\r\nthose most deeply interested in subjects of that sort to consider in\r\nseason, how far the continuance of the same aid is necessary for the\r\nfurther prosecution of the same objects. From the interference of the\r\ngeneral government in making roads and canals, New England has as little\r\nto hope or expect as any part of the country. She has hitherto supported\r\nthem upon principle, and from a sincere disposition to extend the\r\nblessings and the beneficence of the government. And, Sir, I confidently\r\nbelieve that those most concerned in the success of these measures feel\r\ntowards her respect and friendship. They feel that she has acted fairly\r\nand liberally, wholly uninfluenced by selfish or sinister motives.\r\nThose, therefore, who have seen, or thought they saw, an object to be\r\nattained by exciting dislike and odium towards New England, are not\r\nlikely to find quite so favorable an audience as they have expected. It\r\nwill not go for quite so much as wished, to the disadvantage of the\r\nPresident, that he is a native of Massachusetts. Nothing is wanting but\r\nthat we ourselves should entertain a proper feeling on this subject,\r\nand act with a just regard to our own rights and our own duties. If I\r\ncould collect around me the whole population of New England, or if I\r\ncould cause my voice to be heard over all her green hills, or along\r\nevery one of her pleasant streams, in the exercise of true filial\r\naffection, I would say to her, in the language of the great master of\r\nthe maxims of life and conduct,\r\n\r\n  \"This above all,--to thine own self be true,\r\n  And it must follow, as the night the day,\r\n  Thou canst not then be false to any man.\"\r\n\r\nMr. President,--I have delayed you too long. I beg to repeat my\r\nthanks for the kindness which has been manifested towards me by my\r\nfellow-citizens, and to conclude by reciprocating their good wishes:--\r\n\r\nThe City of Boston. Prosperity to all her interests, and happiness to\r\nall her citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [85] The subject referred to is the tariff law of 1828.

Nathaniel Silsbee.\r\n\r\n   [87] Hon. Benjamin Gorham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOSTON MECHANICS' INSTITUTION.[88]\r\n\r\n  I appear before you, Gentlemen, for the performance of a duty which\r\n  is in so great a degree foreign from my habitual studies and\r\n  pursuits, that it may be presumptuous in me to hope for a creditable\r\n  execution of the task. But I have not allowed considerations of this\r\n  kind to weigh against a strong and ardent desire to signify my\r\n  approbation of the objects, and my conviction of the utility, of\r\n  this institution; and to manifest my prompt attention to whatever\r\n  others may suppose to be in my power to promote its respectability\r\n  and to further its designs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the association declares its precise object to be,\r\n\"Mutual Instruction in the Sciences, as connected with the Mechanic\r\nArts.\"\r\n\r\nThe distinct purpose is to connect science more and more with art; to\r\nteach the established, and invent new, modes of combining skill with\r\nstrength; to bring the power of the human understanding in aid of the\r\nphysical powers of the human frame; to facilitate the cooeperation of the\r\nmind with the hand; to promote convenience, lighten labor, and mitigate\r\ntoil, by stretching the dominion of mind farther and farther over the\r\nelements of nature, and by making those elements themselves submit to\r\nhuman rule, follow human bidding, and work together for human\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nThe visible and tangible creation into which we are introduced at our\r\nbirth, is not, in all its parts, fixed and stationary. Motion or change\r\nof place, regular or occasional, belongs to all or most of the things\r\nwhich are around us. Animal life everywhere moves; the earth itself has\r\nits motion, and its complexities of motion; the ocean heaves and\r\nsubsides; rivers run, lingering or rushing, to the sea; and the air\r\nwhich we breathe moves and acts with mighty power. Motion, thus\r\npertaining to the physical objects which surround us, is the exhaustless\r\nfountain whence philosophy draws the means by which, in various degrees\r\nand endless forms, natural agencies and the tendencies of inert matter\r\nare brought to the succor and assistance of human strength. It is the\r\nobject of mechanical contrivance to modify motion, to produce it in new\r\nforms, to direct it to new purposes, to multiply its uses, by its means\r\nto do better that which human strength could do without its aid, and to\r\nperform that, also, which such strength, unassisted by art, could not\r\nperform.\r\n\r\nMotion itself is but the result of force; or, in other words, force is\r\ndefined to be whatever tends to produce motion. The operation of forces,\r\ntherefore, on bodies, is the broad field which is open for that\r\nphilosophical examination, the results of which it is the business of\r\nmechanical contrivance to apply. The leading forces or sources of motion\r\nare, as is well known, the power of animals, gravity, heat, the winds,\r\nand water. There are various others of less power, or of more difficult\r\napplication. Mechanical philosophy, therefore, may be said to be that\r\nscience which instructs us in the knowledge of natural moving powers,\r\nanimate or inanimate; in the manner of modifying those powers, and of\r\nincreasing the intensity of some of them by artificial means, such as\r\nheat and electricity; and in applying the varieties of force and motion,\r\nthus derived from natural agencies, to the arts of life. This is the\r\nobject of mechanical philosophy. None can doubt, certainly, the high\r\nimportance of this sort of knowledge, or fail to see how suitable it is\r\nto the elevated rank and the dignity of reasoning beings. Man's grand\r\ndistinction is his intellect, his mental capacity. It is this which\r\nrenders him highly and peculiarly responsible to his Creator. It is on\r\naccount of this, that the rule over other animals is established in his\r\nhands; and it is this, mainly, which enables him to exercise dominion\r\nover the powers of nature, and to subdue them to himself.\r\n\r\nBut it is true, also, that his own animal organization gives him\r\nsuperiority, and is among the most wonderful of the works of God on\r\nearth. It contributes to cause, as well as prove, his elevated rank in\r\ncreation. His port is erect, his face toward heaven, and he is\r\nfurnished with limbs which are not absolutely necessary to his support\r\nor locomotion, and which are at once powerful, flexible, capable of\r\ninnumerable modes and varieties of action, and terminated by an\r\ninstrument of wonderful, heavenly workmanship,--the human hand. This\r\nmarvellous physical conformation gives man the power of acting with\r\ngreat effect upon external objects, in pursuance of the suggestions\r\nof his understanding, and of applying the results of his reasoning power\r\nto his own purposes. Without this particular formation, he would not\r\nbe man, with whatever sagacity he might have been endowed. No\r\nbounteous grant of intellect, were it the pleasure of Heaven to make\r\nsuch grant, could raise any of the brute creation to an equality with\r\nthe human race. Were it bestowed on the leviathan, he must remain,\r\nnevertheless, in the element where alone he could maintain his\r\nphysical existence. He would still be but the inelegant, misshapen\r\ninhabitant of the ocean, \"wallowing unwieldy, enormous in his gait.\"\r\nWere the elephant made to possess it, it would but teach him the\r\ndeformity of his own structure, the unsightliness of his frame,\r\nthough \"the hugest of things,\" his disability to act on external\r\nmatter, and the degrading nature of his own physical wants, which\r\nlead him to the deserts, and give him for his favorite home the torrid\r\nplains of the tropics. It was placing the king of Babylon sufficiently\r\nout of the rank of human beings, though he carried all his reasoning\r\nfaculties with him, when he was sent away to eat grass like an ox. And\r\nthis may properly suggest to our consideration, what is undeniably\r\ntrue, that there is hardly a greater blessing conferred on man than his\r\nnatural wants. If he had wanted no more than the beasts, who can say\r\nhow much more than they he would have attained? Does he associate,\r\ndoes he cultivate, does he build, does he navigate? The original impulse\r\nto all these lies in his wants. It proceeds from the necessities of\r\nhis condition, and from the efforts of unsatisfied desire. Every want,\r\nnot of a low kind, physical as well as moral, which the human breast\r\nfeels, and which brutes do not feel and cannot feel, raises man by so\r\nmuch in the scale of existence, and is a clear proof and a direct\r\ninstance of the favor of God towards his so much favored human\r\noffspring. If man had been so made as to desire nothing, he would\r\nhave wanted almost every thing worth possessing.\r\n\r\nBut doubtless the reasoning faculty, the mind, is the leading and\r\ncharacteristic attribute of the human race. By the exercise of this,\r\nman arrives at the knowledge of the properties of natural bodies. This\r\nis science, properly and emphatically so called. It is the science\r\nof pure mathematics; and in the high branches of this science lies the\r\ntrue sublime of human acquisition. If any attainment deserve that\r\nepithet, it is the knowledge, which, from the mensuration of the\r\nminutest dust of the balance, proceeds on the rising scale of\r\nmaterial bodies, everywhere weighing, everywhere measuring, everywhere\r\ndetecting and explaining the laws of force and motion, penetrating\r\ninto the secret principles which hold the universe of God together,\r\nand balancing world against world, and system against system. When we\r\nseek to accompany those who pursue studies at once so high, so vast,\r\nand so exact; when we arrive at the discoveries of Newton, which pour\r\nin day on the works of God, as if a second _fiat_ for light had gone\r\nforth from his own mouth; when, further, we attempt to follow those\r\nwho set out where Newton paused, making his goal their starting-place,\r\nand, proceeding with demonstration upon demonstration, and discovery\r\nupon discovery, bring new worlds and new systems of worlds within the\r\nlimits of the known universe, failing to learn all only because all is\r\ninfinite; however we say of man, in admiration of his physical\r\nstructure, that \"in form and moving he is express and admirable,\" it\r\nis here, and here without irreverence, we may exclaim, \"In apprehension\r\nhow like a god!\" The study of the pure mathematics will of course\r\nnot be extensively pursued in an institution, which, like this, has a\r\ndirect practical tendency and aim. But it is still to be remembered,\r\nthat pure mathematics lie at the foundation of mechanical philosophy,\r\nand that it is ignorance only which can speak or think of that sublime\r\nscience as useless research or barren speculation.\r\n\r\nIt has already been said, that the general and well-known agents usually\r\nregarded as the principal sources of mechanical powers are gravity,\r\nacting on solid bodies, the fall of water, which is but gravity acting\r\non fluids, air, heat, and animal strength. For the useful direction and\r\napplication of the first four of these, that is, of all of them which\r\nbelong to inanimate nature, some intermediate apparatus or contrivance\r\nbecomes necessary; and this apparatus, whatever its form, is a machine.\r\nA machine is an invention for the application of motion, either by\r\nchanging the direction of the moving power, or by rendering a body in\r\nmotion capable of communicating a motion greater or less than its own to\r\nother bodies, or by enabling it to overcome a power of greater intensity\r\nor force than its own. And it is usually said that every machine,\r\nhowever apparently complex, is capable of being resolved into some one\r\nor more of those single machines, of which, according to one mode of\r\ndescription, there are six, and according to another, three, called the\r\nmechanical powers. But because machinery, or all mechanical contrivance,\r\nis thus capable of resolution into a few elementary forms, it is not to\r\nbe inferred that science, or art, or both together, though pressed with\r\nthe utmost force of human genius, and cultivated by the last degree of\r\nhuman assiduity, will ever exhaust the combinations into which these\r\nelementary forms may be thrown. An indefinite, though not an infinite,\r\nreach of invention may be expected; but indefinite, also, if not\r\ninfinite, are the possible combinations of elementary principles. The\r\nfield, then, is vast and unbounded. We know not to what yet unthought of\r\nheights the power of man over the agencies of nature may be carried. We\r\nonly know that the last half-century has witnessed an amazingly\r\naccelerated progress in useful discoveries, and that, at the present\r\nmoment, science and art are acting together with a new companionship,\r\nand with the most happy and striking results. The history of mechanical\r\nphilosophy is, of itself, a very interesting subject, and will doubtless\r\nbe treated in this place fully and methodically, by stated lecturers.\r\n\r\nIt is a part of the history of man, which, like that of his domestic\r\nhabits and daily occupations, has been too seldom the subject of\r\nresearch; having been thrust aside by the more dazzling topics of war\r\nand political revolutions. We are not often conducted by historians\r\nwithin the houses or huts of our ancestors, as they were centuries ago,\r\nand made acquainted with their domestic utensils and domestic\r\narrangements. We see too little both of the conveniences and\r\ninconveniences of their daily and ordinary life. There are, indeed, rich\r\nmaterials for interesting details on these particulars to be collected\r\nfrom the labors of Goguet and Beckmann, Henry and Turner; but still, a\r\nthorough and well-written history of those inventions in the mechanic\r\narts which are now commonly known is a _desideratum_ in literature.\r\n\r\nHuman sagacity, stimulated by human wants, seizes first on the nearest\r\nnatural assistant. The power of his own arm is an early lesson among the\r\nstudies of primitive man. This is animal strength; and from this he\r\nrises to the conception of employing, for his own use, the strength of\r\nother animals. A stone, impelled by the power of his arm, he finds will\r\nproduce a greater effect than the arm itself; this is a species of\r\nmechanical power. The effect results from a combination of the moving\r\nforce with the gravity of a heavy body. The limb of a tree is a rude,\r\nbut powerful instrument; it is a lever. And the mechanical powers being\r\nall discovered, like other natural qualities, by induction (I use the\r\nword as Bacon used it) or experience, and not by any reasoning _a\r\npriori_, their progress has kept pace with the general civilization and\r\neducation of nations. The history of mechanical philosophy, while it\r\nstrongly illustrates in its general results the force of the human mind,\r\nexhibits in its details most interesting pictures of ingenuity\r\nstruggling with the conception of new combinations, and of deep,\r\nintense, and powerful thought, stretched to its utmost to find out or\r\ndeduce the general principle from the indications of particular facts.\r\nWe are now so far advanced beyond the age when the principal leading,\r\nimportant mathematical discoveries were made, and they have become so\r\nmuch matter of common knowledge, that it is not easy to feel their\r\nimportance, or be justly sensible what an epoch in the history of\r\nscience each constituted. The half-frantic exultation of Archimedes,\r\nwhen he had solved the problem respecting the crown of Hiero, was on an\r\noccasion and for a cause certainly well allowing very high joy. And so\r\nalso was the duplication of the cube.\r\n\r\nThe altar of Apollo, at Athens, was a square block, or cube, and to\r\ndouble it, required the duplication of the cube. This was a process\r\ninvolving an unascertained mathematical principle. It was quite natural,\r\ntherefore, that it should be a traditional story, that, by way of\r\natoning for some affront to that god, the oracle commanded the Athenians\r\nto _double his altar_; an injunction, we know, which occupied the keen\r\nsagacity of the Greek geometricians for more than half a century, before\r\nthey were able to obey it. It is to the great honor, however, of this\r\ninimitable people, the Greeks, a people whose genius seems to have been\r\nequally fitted for the investigations of science and the works of\r\nimagination, that the immortal Euclid, centuries before our era,\r\ncomposed his Elements of Geometry; a work which, for two thousand years,\r\nhas been, and still continues to be, a text-book for instruction in that\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nA history of mechanical philosophy, however, would not begin with\r\nGreece. There is a wonder beyond Greece. Higher up in the annals of\r\nmankind, nearer, far nearer, to the origin of our race, out of all reach\r\nof letters, beyond the sources of tradition, beyond all history, except\r\nwhat remains in the monuments of her own art, stands Egypt, the mother\r\nof nations! Egypt! Thebes! the Labyrinth! the Pyramids! Who shall\r\nexplain the mysteries which these names suggest? The Pyramids! Who can\r\ninform us whether it was by mere numbers, and patience, and labor, aided\r\nperhaps by the simple lever, or if not, by what forgotten combination of\r\npowers, by what now unknown machines, mass was thus aggregated to mass,\r\nand quarry piled on quarry, till solid granite seemed to cover the earth\r\nand reach the skies?\r\n\r\nThe ancients discovered many things, but they left many things also to\r\nbe discovered; and this, as a general truth, is what our posterity a\r\nthousand years hence will be able to say, doubtless, when we and our\r\ngeneration shall be recorded also among the ancients. For, indeed, God\r\nseems to have proposed his material universe as a standing, perpetual\r\nstudy to his intelligent creatures; where, ever learning, they can yet\r\nnever learn all; and if that material universe shall last till man shall\r\nhave discovered all that is now unknown, but which by the progressive\r\nimprovement of his faculties he is capable of knowing, it will remain\r\nthrough a duration beyond human measurement, and beyond human\r\ncomprehension.\r\n\r\nThe ancients knew nothing of our present system of arithmetical\r\nnotation; nothing of algebra, and, of course, nothing of the important\r\napplication of algebra to geometry. They had not learned the use of\r\nlogarithms, and were ignorant of fluxions. They had not attained to any\r\njust mode for the mensuration of the earth; a matter of great moment to\r\nastronomy, navigation, and other branches of useful knowledge. It is\r\nscarcely necessary to add, that they were ignorant of the great results\r\nwhich have followed the development of the principle of gravitation.\r\n\r\nIn the useful and practical arts, many inventions and contrivances, to\r\nthe production of which the degree of knowledge possessed by the\r\nancients would appear to us to have been adequate, and which seem quite\r\nobvious, are yet of late origin. The application of water, for example,\r\nto turn a mill, is a thing not known to have been accomplished at all in\r\nGreece, and is not supposed to have been attempted at Rome till in or\r\nnear the age of Augustus. The production of the same effect by wind is a\r\nstill later invention. It dates only in the seventh century of our era.\r\nThe propulsion of the saw by any other power than that of the arm is\r\ntreated as a novelty in England, so late as in the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century. The Bishop of Ely, at that time ambassador from the\r\nqueen of England to the Pope, says, \"he saw, at Lyons, a sawmill driven\r\nwith an upright wheel, and the water that maketh it go is gathered whole\r\ninto a narrow trough, which delivereth the same water to the wheels.\r\nThis wheel hath a piece of timber put to the axletree end, like the\r\nhandle of a _broch_ (a hand-organ), and fastened to the end of the saw,\r\nwhich being turned with the force of water, hoisteth up and down the\r\nsaw, that it continually eateth in, and the handle of the same is kept\r\nin a rigall of wood, from swerving. Also the timber lieth, as it were,\r\nupon a ladder, which is brought by little and little to the saw with\r\nanother vice.\"[89] From this description of the primitive power-saw, it\r\nwould seem that it was probably fast only at one end, and that the broch\r\nand rigall performed the part of the arm in the common use of the\r\nhandsaw.\r\n\r\nIt must always have been a very considerable object for men to possess\r\nor obtain the power of raising water otherwise than by mere manual\r\nlabor. Yet nothing like the common suction-pump has been found among\r\nrude nations. It has arrived at its present state only by slow and\r\ncautious steps of improvement; and, indeed, in that present state,\r\nhowever obvious and unattractive, it is something of an abstruse and\r\nrefined invention. It was unknown in China, until Europeans visited the\r\n\"Celestial Empire\"; and is still unknown in other parts of Asia, beyond\r\nthe pale of European settlements or the reach of European communication.\r\nThe Greeks and Romans are supposed to have been ignorant of it, in the\r\nearly times of their history; and it is usually said to have come from\r\nAlexandria, where physical science was much cultivated by the Greek\r\nphilosophers, under the patronage of the Ptolemies.\r\n\r\nThese few and scattered historical notices, Gentlemen, of important\r\ninventions, have been introduced only for the purpose of suggesting that\r\nthere is much which is both curious and instructive in the history of\r\nmechanics; and that many things which to us, in our state of knowledge,\r\nseem so obvious as that we should think they would at once force\r\nthemselves on men's adoption, have, nevertheless, been accomplished\r\nslowly and by painful efforts.\r\n\r\nBut if the history of the progress of the mechanical arts be\r\ninteresting, still more so, doubtless, would be the exhibition of their\r\npresent state, and a full display of the extent to which they are now\r\ncarried. This field is much too wide to be entered on this occasion. The\r\nbriefest outline even would exceed its limits; and the whole subject\r\nwill regularly fall to hands much more able to sustain it. The slightest\r\nglance, however, must convince us that mechanical power and mechanical\r\nskill, as they are now exhibited in Europe and America, mark an epoch in\r\nhuman history worthy of all admiration. Machinery is made to perform\r\nwhat has formerly been the toil of human hands, to an extent that\r\nastonishes the most sanguine, with a degree of power to which no number\r\nof human arms is equal, and with such precision and exactness as almost\r\nto suggest the notion of reason and intelligence in the machines\r\nthemselves. Every natural agent is put unrelentingly to the task. The\r\nwinds work, the waters work, the elasticity of metals works; gravity is\r\nsolicited into a thousand new forms of action; levers are multiplied\r\nupon levers; wheels revolve on the peripheries of other wheels; the saw\r\nand the plane are tortured into an accommodation to new uses, and, last\r\nof all, with inimitable power, and \"with whirlwind sound,\" comes the\r\npotent agency of steam. In comparison with the past, what centuries of\r\nimprovement has this single agent comprised, in the short compass of\r\nfifty years! Everywhere practicable, everywhere efficient, it has an arm\r\na thousand times stronger than that of Hercules, and to which human\r\ningenuity is capable of fitting a thousand times as many hands as\r\nbelonged to Briareus. Steam is found in triumphant operation on the\r\nseas; and under the influence of its strong propulsion, the gallant\r\nship,\r\n\r\n  \"Against the wind, against the tide,\r\n  Still _steadies_, with an upright keel.\"\r\n\r\nIt is on the rivers, and the boatman may repose on his oars; it is on\r\nhighways, and begins to exert itself along the courses of land\r\nconveyance; it is at the bottom of mines, a thousand feet below the\r\nearth's surface; it is in the mill, and in the workshops of the trades.\r\nIt rows, it pumps, it excavates, it carries, it draws, it lifts, it\r\nhammers, it spins, it weaves, it prints. It seems to say to men, at\r\nleast to the class of artisans, \"Leave off your manual labor, give over\r\nyour bodily toil; bestow but your skill and reason to the directing of\r\nmy power, and I will bear the toil,--with no muscle to grow weary, no\r\nnerve to relax, no breast to feel faintness.\" What further improvements\r\nmay still be made in the use of this astonishing power, it is impossible\r\nto know, and it were vain to conjecture. What we do know is, that it has\r\nmost essentially altered the face of affairs, and that no visible limit\r\nyet appears, beyond which its progress is seen to be impossible. If its\r\npower were now to be annihilated, if we were to miss it on the water and\r\nin the mills, it would seem as if we were going back to rude ages.\r\n\r\nThis society, then, Gentlemen, is instituted for the purpose of further\r\nand further applying science to the arts, at a time when there is much\r\nof science to be applied. Philosophy and the mathematics have attained\r\nto high degrees, and still stretch their wings like the eagle.\r\nChemistry, at the same time, acting in another direction, has made\r\nequally important discoveries, capable of a direct application to the\r\npurposes of life. Here, again, within so short a period as the lives of\r\nsome of us, almost all that is known has been learned. And while there\r\nis this aggregate of science, already vast, but still rapidly\r\nincreasing, offering itself to the ingenuity of mechanical contrivance,\r\nthere is a corresponding demand for every work and invention of art,\r\nproduced by the wants of a rich, an enterprising, and an elegant age.\r\nAssociations like this, therefore, have materials to work upon, ends to\r\nwork for, and encouragement to work.\r\n\r\nIt may not be improper to suggest, that not only are the general\r\ncircumstances of the age favorable to such institutions as this, but\r\nthat there seems a high degree of propriety that one or more should be\r\nestablished here, in the metropolis of New England. In no other part of\r\nthe country is there so great a concentration of mechanical operations.\r\nEvents have given to New England the lead in the great business of\r\ndomestic manufactures. Her thickened population, her energetic free\r\nlabor, her abundant falls of water, and various other causes, have led\r\nher citizens to engage, with great boldness, in extensive manufactures.\r\nThe success of their establishments depends, of course, in no small\r\ndegree, upon the perfection to which machinery may be carried.\r\nImprovement in this, therefore, instead of being left to chance or\r\naccident, is justly regarded as a fit subject of assiduous study. The\r\nattention of our community is also, at the present moment, strongly\r\nattracted towards the construction of canals, railways, dry docks, and\r\nother important public works. Civil engineering is becoming a\r\nprofession, offering honorable support and creditable distinction to\r\nsuch as may qualify themselves to discharge its duties. Another\r\ninteresting fact is before us. New taste and a new excitement are\r\nevidently springing up in our vicinity in regard to an art, which, as it\r\nunites in a singular degree utility and beauty, affords inviting\r\nencouragements to genius and skill. I mean Architecture. Architecture is\r\nmilitary, naval, sacred, civil, or domestic. Naval architecture,\r\ncertainly, is of the highest importance to a commercial and navigating\r\npeople to say nothing of its intimate and essential connection with the\r\nmeans of national defence. This science should not be regarded as having\r\nalready reached its utmost perfection. It seems to have been for some\r\ntime in a course of rapid advancement. The building, the rigging, the\r\nnavigating of ships, have, within the knowledge of every one, been\r\nsubjects of great improvement within the last fifteen years. And where,\r\nrather than in New England, may still further improvements be looked\r\nfor? Where is ship-building either a greater business, or pursued with\r\nmore skill and eagerness?\r\n\r\nIn civil, sacred, and domestic architecture, present appearances\r\nauthorize the strongest hopes of improvement. These hopes rest, among\r\nother things, on unambiguous indications of the growing prevalence of a\r\njust taste. The principles of architecture are founded in nature, or\r\ngood sense, as much as the principles of epic poetry. This art\r\nconstitutes a beautiful medium between what belongs to mere fancy and\r\nwhat belongs entirely to the exact sciences. In its forms and\r\nmodifications it admits of infinite variation, giving broad room for\r\ninvention and genius; while, in its general principles, it is founded\r\non that which long experience and the concurrent judgment of ages have\r\nascertained to be generally pleasing. Certain relations of parts to\r\nparts have been satisfactory to all the cultivated generations of men.\r\nThese relations constitute what is called _proportion_, and this is the\r\ngreat basis of architectural art. This established proportion is not to\r\nbe _followed_ merely because it is ancient, but because its use, and the\r\npleasure which it has been found capable of giving to the mind, through\r\nthe eye, in ancient times, and modern times, and all civilized times,\r\nprove that its principles are well founded and just; in the same manner\r\nthat the Iliad is proved, by the consent of all ages, to be a good\r\npoem.\r\n\r\nArchitecture, I have said, is an art that unites in a singular manner\r\nthe useful and the beautiful. It is not to be inferred from this that\r\nevery thing in architecture is beautiful, or is to be so esteemed, in\r\nexact proportion to its apparent utility. No more is meant, than that\r\nnothing which evidently thwarts utility can or ought to be accounted\r\nbeautiful; because, in every work of art, the design is to be regarded,\r\nand what defeats that design cannot be considered as well done. The\r\nFrench rhetoricians have a maxim, that, in literary composition,\r\n\"nothing is beautiful which is not true.\" They do not intend to say,\r\nthat strict and literal truth is alone beautiful in poetry or oratory;\r\nbut they mean, that that which grossly offends against probability is\r\nnot in good taste in either. The same relation subsists between beauty\r\nand utility in architecture as between truth and imagination in poetry.\r\nUtility is not to be obviously sacrificed to beauty, in the one case;\r\ntruth and probability are not to be outraged for the cause of fiction\r\nand fancy, in the other. In the severer styles of architecture, beauty\r\nand utility approach so as to be almost identical. Where utility is more\r\nespecially the main design, the proportions which produce it raise the\r\nsense or feeling of beauty, by a sort of reflection or deduction of the\r\nmind. It is said that ancient Rome had perhaps no finer specimens of the\r\nclassic Doric than the sewers which ran under her streets, and which\r\nwere of course always to be covered from human observation: so true is\r\nit, that cultivated taste is always pleased with justness of proportion;\r\nand that design, seen to be accomplished, gives pleasure. The discovery\r\nand fast-increasing use of a noble material, found in vast abundance\r\nnearer to our city than the Pentelican quarries to Athens, may well\r\nawaken, as they do, new attention to architectural improvement. If this\r\nmaterial be not entirely well suited to the elegant Ionic or the rich\r\nCorinthian, it is yet fitted, beyond marble, beyond perhaps almost any\r\nother material, for the Doric, of which the appropriate character is\r\nstrength, and for the Gothic, of which the appropriate character is\r\ngrandeur.\r\n\r\nIt is not more than justice, perhaps, to our ancestors, to call the\r\nGothic the English classic architecture; for in England, probably, are\r\nits most distinguished specimens. As its leading characteristic is\r\ngrandeur, its main use would seem to be sacred. It had its origin,\r\nindeed, in ecclesiastical architecture. Its evident design was to\r\nsurpass the ancient orders by the size of the structure and its far\r\ngreater heights; to excite perceptions of beauty by the branching\r\ntraceries and the gorgeous tabernacles within; and to inspire religious\r\nawe and reverence by the lofty pointed arches, the flying buttresses,\r\nthe spires, and the pinnacles, springing from beneath, and stretching\r\nupwards towards the heavens with the prayers of the worshippers.\r\nArchitectural beauty having always a direct reference to utility,\r\nedifices, whether civil or sacred, must of course undergo different\r\nchanges, in different places, on account of climate, and in different\r\nages, on account of the different states of other arts or different\r\nnotions of convenience. The hypethral temple, for example, or temple\r\nwithout a roof, is not to be thought of in our latitude; and the use of\r\nglass, a thing not now to be dispensed with, is also to be accommodated,\r\nas well as it may be, to the architectural structure. These necessary\r\nvariations, and many more admissible ones, give room for improvements to\r\nan indefinite extent, without departing from the principles of true\r\ntaste. May we not hope, then, to see our own city celebrated as the city\r\nof architectural excellence? May we not hope to see our native granite\r\nreposing in the ever-during strength of the Doric, or springing up in\r\nthe grand and lofty Gothic, in forms which beauty and utility, the eye\r\nand the judgment, taste and devotion, shall unite to approve and to\r\nadmire? But while we regard sacred and civil architecture as highly\r\nimportant, let us not forget that other branch, so essential to personal\r\ncomfort and happiness,--domestic architecture or common house-building.\r\nIn ancient times, in all governments, and under despotic governments in\r\nall times, the convenience or gratification of the monarch, the\r\ngovernment, or the public has been allowed too often to put aside\r\nconsiderations of personal and individual happiness. With us, different\r\nideas happily prevail. With us, it is not the public, or the government,\r\nin its corporate character, that is the only object of regard. The\r\npublic happiness is to be the aggregate of the happiness of individuals.\r\nOur system begins with the individual man. It begins with him when he\r\nleaves the cradle; and it proposes to instruct him in knowledge and in\r\nmorals, to prepare him for his state of manhood; on his arrival at that\r\nstate, to invest him with political rights, to protect him in his\r\nproperty and pursuits, and in his family and social connections; and\r\nthus to enable him to enjoy, as an individual moral and rational being,\r\nwhat belongs to a moral and rational being. For the same reason, the\r\narts are to be promoted for their general utility, as they affect the\r\npersonal happiness and well-being of the individuals who compose the\r\ncommunity. It would be adverse to the whole spirit of our system, that\r\nwe should have gorgeous and expensive public buildings, if individuals\r\nwere at the same time to live in houses of mud. Our public edifices are\r\nto be reared by the surplus of wealth and the savings of labor, after\r\nthe necessities and comforts of individuals are provided for; and not,\r\nlike the Pyramids, by the unremitted toil of thousands of half-starved\r\nslaves. Domestic architecture, therefore, as connected with individual\r\ncomfort and happiness, is to hold a first place in the esteem of our\r\nartists. Let our citizens have houses cheap, but comfortable; not gaudy,\r\nbut in good taste; not judged by the portion of earth they cover, but by\r\ntheir symmetry, their fitness for use, and their durability.\r\n\r\nWithout further reference to particular arts with which the objects of\r\nthis society have a close connection, it may yet be added, generally,\r\nthat this is a period of great activity, of industry, of enterprise in\r\nthe various walks of life. It is a period, too, of growing wealth and\r\nincreasing prosperity. It is a time when men are fast multiplying, but\r\nwhen means are increasing still faster than men. An auspicious moment,\r\nthen, it is, full of motive and encouragement, for the vigorous\r\nprosecution of those inquiries which have for their object the discovery\r\nof farther and farther means of uniting the results of scientific\r\nresearch to the arts and business of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [88] Introductory Lecture, read at this Opening of the Course for the\r\n        Season, on the 12th of November, 1828.\r\n\r\n   [89] See Beckmann's Inventions, Vol. I. p. 373, where the passage is\r\n        quoted from the Miscellaneous State Papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC DINNER AT NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February, 1831, several distinguished gentlemen of the city cf New\r\nYork, in behalf of themselves and a large number of other citizens,\r\ninvited Mr. Webster to a public dinner, as a mark of their respect for\r\nthe value and success of his efforts, in the preceding session of\r\nCongress, in defence of the Constitution of the United States. His\r\nspeech in reply to Mr. Hayne (contained in a subsequent volume of this\r\ncollection), which, by that time, had been circulated and read through\r\nthe country to a greater extent than any speech ever before delivered in\r\nCongress, was the particular effort which led to this invitation.\r\n\r\nThe dinner took place at the City Hotel, on the 10th of March, and was\r\nattended by a very large assembly.\r\n\r\nChancellor Kent presided, and, in proposing to the company the health of\r\ntheir guest, made the following remarks:--\r\n\r\n  \"New England has been long fruitful in great men, the necessary\r\n  consequence of the admirable discipline of her institutions--and we\r\n  are this day honored with the presence of one of those cherished\r\n  objects of her attachment and pride, who has an undoubted and\r\n  peculiar title to our regard. It is a plain truth, that he who\r\n  defends the constitution of his country by his wisdom in council is\r\n  entitled to share her gratitude with those who protect it by valor\r\n  in the field. Peace has its victories as well as war. We all\r\n  recollect a late memorable occasion, when the exalted talents and\r\n  enlightened patriotism of the gentleman to whom I have alluded were\r\n  exerted in the support of our national Union and the sound\r\n  interpretation of its charter.\r\n\r\n  \"If there be any one political precept preeminent above all others\r\n  and acknowledged by all, it is that which dictates the absolute\r\n  necessity of a union of the States under one government, and that\r\n  government clothed with those attributes and powers with which the\r\n  existing Constitution has invested it. We are indebted, under\r\n  Providence, to the operation and influence of the powers of that\r\n  Constitution for our national honor abroad and for unexampled\r\n  prosperity at home. Its future stability depends upon the firm\r\n  support and due exercise of its legitimate powers in all their\r\n  branches. A tendency to disunion, to anarchy among the members\r\n  rather than to tyranny in the head, has been heretofore the\r\n  melancholy fate of all the federal governments of ancient and\r\n  modern Europe. Our Union and national Constitution were formed, as\r\n  we have hitherto been led to believe, under better auspices and with\r\n  improved wisdom. But there was a deadly principle of disease\r\n  inherent in the system. The assumption by any member of the Union of\r\n  the right to question and resist, or annul, as its own judgment\r\n  should dictate, either the laws of Congress, or the treaties, or the\r\n  decisions of the federal courts, or the mandates of the executive\r\n  power, duly made and promulgated as the Constitution prescribes, was\r\n  a most dangerous assumption of power, leading to collision and the\r\n  destruction of the system. And if, contrary to all our expectations,\r\n  we should hereafter fail in the grand experiment of a confederate\r\n  government extending over some of the fairest portions of this\r\n  continent, and destined to act, at the same time, with efficiency\r\n  and harmony, we should most grievously disappoint the hopes of\r\n  mankind, and blast for ever the fruits of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n  \"But, happily for us, the refutation of such dangerous pretensions,\r\n  on the occasion referred to, was signal and complete. The false\r\n  images and delusive theories which had perplexed the thoughts and\r\n  disturbed the judgments of men, were then dissipated in like manner\r\n  as spectres disappear at the rising of the sun. The inestimable\r\n  value of the Union, and the true principles of the Constitution,\r\n  were explained by clear and accurate reasonings, and enforced by\r\n  pathetic and eloquent illustrations. The result was the more\r\n  auspicious, as the heretical doctrines which were then fairly\r\n  reasoned down had been advanced by a very respectable portion of the\r\n  Union, and urged on the floor of the Senate by the polished mind,\r\n  manly zeal, and honored name of a distinguished member from the\r\n  South.\r\n\r\n  \"The consequences of that discussion have been extremely beneficial.\r\n  It turned the attention of the public to the great doctrines of\r\n  national rights and national union. Constitutional law ceased to\r\n  remain wrapped up in the breasts, and taught only by the responses,\r\n  of the living oracles of the law. Socrates was said to have drawn\r\n  down philosophy from the skies, and scattered it among the schools.\r\n  It may with equal truth be said that constitutional law, by means of\r\n  those senatorial discussions and the master genius that guided them,\r\n  was rescued from the archives of our tribunals and the libraries of\r\n  lawyers, and placed under the eye, and submitted to the judgment, of\r\n  the American people. _Their verdict is with us, and from it their\r\n  lies no appeal._\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the immense cheering and acclamations with which this address\r\nand toast were received had subsided, Mr. Webster rose and addressed the\r\ncompany as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC DINNER AT NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nI owe the honor of this occasion, Gentlemen, to your patriotic and\r\naffectionate attachment to the Constitution of our country. For an\r\neffort, well intended, however otherwise of unpretending character, made\r\nin the discharge of public duty, and designed to maintain the\r\nConstitution and vindicate its just powers, you have been pleased to\r\ntender me this token of your respect. It would be idle affectation to\r\ndeny that it gives me singular gratification. Every public man must\r\nnaturally desire the approbation of his fellow-citizens; and though it\r\nmay be supposed that I should be anxious, in the first place, not to\r\ndisappoint the expectations of those whose immediate representative I\r\nam, it is not possible but that I should feel, nevertheless, the high\r\nvalue of such a mark of esteem as is here offered. But, Gentlemen, I am\r\nconscious that the main purpose of this occasion is higher than mere\r\nmanifestation of personal regard. It is to evince your devotion to the\r\nConstitution, your sense of its transcendent value, and your just alarm\r\nat whatever threatens to weaken its proper authority, or endanger its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, this could hardly be otherwise. It would be strange, indeed,\r\nif the members of this vast commercial community should not be first and\r\nforemost to rally for the Constitution, whenever opinions and doctrines\r\nare advanced hostile to its principles. Where sooner than here, where\r\nlouder than here, may we expect a patriotic voice to be raised, when the\r\nunion of the States is threatened? In this great emporium, at this\r\ncentral point of the united commerce of the United States, of all\r\nplaces, we may expect the warmest, the most determined and universal\r\nfeeling of attachment to the national government. Gentlemen, no one can\r\nestimate more highly than I do the natural advantages of your city. No\r\none entertains a higher opinion than myself, also, of that spirit of\r\nwise and liberal policy, which has actuated the government of your own\r\ngreat State in the accomplishment of high objects, important to the\r\ngrowth and prosperity both of the State and the city. But all these\r\nlocal advantages, and all this enlightened state policy, could never\r\nhave made your city what it now is, without the aid and protection of a\r\ngeneral government, extending over all the States, and establishing for\r\nall a common and uniform system of commercial regulation. Without\r\nnational character, without public credit, without systematic finance,\r\nwithout uniformity of commercial laws, all other advantages possessed by\r\nthis city would have decayed and perished, like unripe fruit. A general\r\ngovernment was, for years before it was instituted, the great object of\r\ndesire to the inhabitants of this city. New York, at a very early day,\r\nwas conscious of her local advantages for commerce; she saw her destiny,\r\nand was eager to embrace it; but nothing else than a general government\r\ncould make free her path before her, and set her forward on her\r\nbrilliant career. She early saw all this, and to the accomplishment of\r\nthis great and indispensable object she bent every faculty, and exerted\r\nevery effort. She was not mistaken. She formed no false judgment. At the\r\nmoment of the adoption of the Constitution, New York was the capital of\r\none State, and contained thirty-two or three thousand people. It now\r\ncontains more than two hundred thousand people, and is justly regarded\r\nas the commercial capital, not only of all the United States, but of the\r\nwhole continent also, from the pole to the South Sea. Every page of her\r\nhistory, for the last forty years, bears high and irresistible testimony\r\nto the benefits and blessings of the general government. Her astonishing\r\ngrowth is referred to, and quoted, all the world over, as one of the\r\nmost striking proofs of the effects of our Federal Union. To suppose her\r\nnow to be easy and indifferent, when notions are advanced tending to its\r\ndissolution, would be to suppose her equally forgetful of the past and\r\nblind to the present, alike ignorant of her own history and her own\r\ninterest, metamorphosed, from all that she has been, into a being tired\r\nof its prosperity, sick of its own growth and greatness, and infatuated\r\nfor its own destruction. Every blow aimed at the union of the States\r\nstrikes on the tenderest nerve of her interest and her happiness. To\r\nbring the Union into debate is to bring her own future prosperity into\r\ndebate also. To speak of arresting the laws of the Union, of interposing\r\nState power in matters of commerce and revenue, of weakening the full\r\nand just authority of the general government, would be, in regard to\r\nthis city, but another mode of speaking of commercial ruin, of abandoned\r\nwharfs, of vacated houses, of diminished and dispersing population, of\r\nbankrupt merchants, of mechanics without employment, and laborers\r\nwithout bread. The growth of this city and the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States are coevals and contemporaries. They began together, they\r\nhave flourished together, and if rashness and folly destroy one, the\r\nother will follow it to the tomb.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it is true, indeed, that the growth of this city is\r\nextraordinary, and almost unexampled. It is now, I believe, sixteen or\r\nseventeen years since I first saw it. Within that comparatively short\r\nperiod, it has added to its number three times the whole amount of its\r\npopulation when the Constitution was adopted. Of all things having power\r\nto check this prosperity, of all things potent to blight and blast it,\r\nof all things capable of compelling this city to recede as fast as she\r\nhas advanced, a disturbed government, an enfeebled public authority, a\r\nbroken or a weakened union of the States, would be most efficacious.\r\nThis would be cause efficient enough. Every thing else, in the common\r\nfortune of communities, she may hope to resist or to prevent; but this\r\nwould be fatal as the arrow of death.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, you have personal recollections and associations, connected\r\nwith the establishment and adoption of the Constitution, which are\r\nnecessarily called up on an occasion like this. It is impossible to\r\nforget the prominent agency exercised by eminent citizens of your own,\r\nin regard to that great measure. Those great men are now recorded among\r\nthe illustrious dead; but they have left names never to be forgotten,\r\nand never to be remembered without respect and veneration. Least of all\r\ncan they be forgotten by you, when assembled here for the purpose of\r\nsignifying your attachment to the Constitution, and your sense of its\r\ninestimable importance to the happiness of the people.\r\n\r\nI should do violence to my own feelings, Gentlemen, I think I should\r\noffend yours, if I omitted respectful mention of distinguished names yet\r\nfresh in your recollections. How can I stand here, to speak of the\r\nConstitution of the United States, of the wisdom of its provisions, of\r\nthe difficulties attending its adoption, of the evils from which it\r\nrescued the country, and of the prosperity and power to which it has\r\nraised it, and yet pay no tribute to those who were highly instrumental\r\nin accomplishing the work? While we are here to rejoice that it yet\r\nstands firm and strong, while we congratulate one another that we live\r\nunder its benign influence, and cherish hopes of its long duration, we\r\ncannot forget who they were that, in the day of our national infancy, in\r\nthe times of despondency and despair, mainly assisted to work out our\r\ndeliverance. I should feel that I was unfaithful to the strong\r\nrecollections which the occasion presses upon us, that I was not true to\r\ngratitude, not true to patriotism, not true to the living or the dead,\r\nnot true to your feelings or my own, if I should forbear to make mention\r\nof ALEXANDER HAMILTON.\r\n\r\nComing from the military service of the country yet a youth, but with\r\nknowledge and maturity, even in civil affairs, far beyond his years,\r\nhe made this city the place of his adoption; and he gave the whole\r\npowers of his mind to the contemplation of the weak and distracted\r\ncondition of the country. Daily increasing in acquaintance and\r\nconfidence with the people of New York, he saw, what they also saw,\r\nthe absolute necessity of some closer bond of union for the States.\r\nThis was the great object of desire. He never appears to have lost\r\nsight of it, but was found in the lead whenever any thing was to be\r\nattempted for its accomplishment One experiment after another, as is\r\nwell known, was tried, and all failed. The States were urgently called\r\non to confer such further powers on the old Congress as would enable\r\nit to redeem the public faith, or to adopt, themselves, some general\r\nand common principle of commercial regulation. But the States had not\r\nagreed, and were not likely to agree. In this posture of affairs, so\r\nfull of public difficulty and public distress, commissioners from five\r\nor six of the States met, on the request of Virginia, at Annapolis, in\r\nSeptember, 1786. The precise object of their appointment was to take\r\ninto consideration the trade of the United States; to examine the\r\nrelative situations and trade of the several States; and to consider\r\nhow far a uniform system of commercial regulations was necessary to\r\ntheir common interest and permanent harmony. Mr. Hamilton was one of\r\nthese commissioners; and I have understood, though I cannot assert the\r\nfact, that their report was drawn by him. His associate from this\r\nState was the venerable Judge Benson, who has lived long, and still\r\nlives, to see the happy results of the counsels which originated in this\r\nmeeting. Of its members, he and Mr. Madison are, I believe, now the\r\nonly survivors. These commissioners recommended, what took place the\r\nnext year, a general Convention of all the States, to take into serious\r\ndeliberation the condition of the country, and devise such provisions\r\nas should render the constitution of the federal government adequate\r\nto the exigencies of the Union. I need not remind you, that of this\r\nConvention Mr. Hamilton was an active and efficient member. The\r\nConstitution was framed, and submitted to the country. And then\r\nanother great work was to be undertaken. The Constitution would\r\nnaturally find, and did find, enemies and opposers. Objections to it\r\nwere numerous, and powerful, and spirited. They were to be answered; and\r\nthey were effectually answered. The writers of the numbers of the\r\nFederalist, Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Madison, and Mr. Jay, so greatly\r\ndistinguished themselves in their discussions of the Constitution,\r\nthat those numbers are generally received as important commentaries\r\non the text, and accurate expositions, in general, of its objects and\r\npurposes. Those papers were all written and published in this city. Mr.\r\nHamilton was elected one of the distinguished delegation from the city\r\nto the State Convention at Poughkeepsie, called to ratify the new\r\nConstitution. Its debates are published. Mr. Hamilton appears to have\r\nexerted, on this occasion, to the utmost, every power and faculty of\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nThe whole question was likely to depend on the decision of New York. He\r\nfelt the full importance of the crisis; and the reports of his speeches,\r\nimperfect as they probably are, are yet lasting monuments to his genius\r\nand patriotism. He saw at last his hopes fulfilled; he saw the\r\nConstitution adopted, and the government under it established and\r\norganized. The discerning eye of Washington immediately called him to\r\nthat post, which was far the most important in the administration of the\r\nnew system. He was made Secretary of the Treasury; and how he fulfilled\r\nthe duties of such a place, at such a time, the whole country perceived\r\nwith delight and the whole world saw with admiration. He smote the rock\r\nof the national resources, and abundant streams of revenue gushed forth.\r\nHe touched the dead corpse of the Public Credit, and it sprung upon its\r\nfeet. The fabled birth of Minerva, from the brain of Jove, was hardly\r\nmore sudden or more perfect than the financial system of the United\r\nStates, as it burst forth from the conceptions of ALEXANDER HAMILTON.\r\n\r\nYour recollections, Gentlemen, your respect, and your affections, all\r\nconspire to bring before you, at such a time as this, another great\r\nman, now too numbered with the dead. I mean the pure, the disinterested,\r\nthe patriotic JOHN JAY. His character is a brilliant jewel in the\r\nsacred treasures of national reputation. Leaving his profession at an\r\nearly period, yet not before he had singularly distinguished himself in\r\nit, his whole life, from the commencement of the Revolution until his\r\nfinal retirement, was a life of public service. A member of the first\r\nCongress, he was the author of that political paper which is generally\r\nacknowledged to stand first among the incomparable productions of that\r\nbody;[90] productions which called forth that decisive strain of\r\ncommendation from the great Lord Chatham, in which he pronounced them\r\nnot inferior to the finest productions of the master states of the\r\nworld. Mr. Jay had been abroad, and he had also been long intrusted\r\nwith the difficult duties of our foreign correspondence at home. He had\r\nseen and felt, in the fullest measure and to the greatest possible\r\nextent, the difficulty of conducting our foreign affairs honorably and\r\nusefully, without a stronger and more perfect domestic union. Though\r\nnot a member of the Convention which framed the Constitution, he was\r\nyet present while it was in session, and looked anxiously for its\r\nresult. By the choice of this city, he had a seat in the State\r\nConvention, and took an active and zealous part for the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution. On the organization of the new government, he was\r\nselected by Washington to be the first Chief Justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States; and surely the high and most responsible\r\nduties of that station could not have been trusted to abler or safer\r\nhands. It is the duty of that tribunal, one of equal importance and\r\ndelicacy, to decide constitutional questions, occasionally arising\r\non State laws. The general learning and ability, and especially the\r\nprudence, the mildness, and the firmness of his character, eminently\r\nfitted Mr. Jay to be the head of such a court. When the spotless\r\nermine of the judicial robe fell on John Jay, it touched nothing\r\nless spotless than itself.\r\n\r\nThese eminent men, Gentlemen, the contemporaries of some of you, known\r\nto most, and revered by all, were so conspicuous in the framing and\r\nadopting of the Constitution, and called so early to important stations\r\nunder it, that a tribute, better, indeed, than I have given, or am able\r\nto give, seemed due to them from us, on this occasion.\r\n\r\nThere was yet another, of whom mention is to be made. In the\r\nRevolutionary history of the country, the name of CHANCELLOR LIVINGSTON\r\nbecame early prominent. He was a member of that Congress which declared\r\nIndependence; and a member, too, of the committee which drew and\r\nreported the immortal Declaration. At the period of the adoption of the\r\nConstitution, he was its firm friend and able advocate. He was a member\r\nof the State Convention, being one of that list of distinguished and\r\ngifted men who represented this city in that body; and he threw the\r\nwhole weight of his talents and influence into the doubtful scale of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, as connected with the Constitution, you have also local\r\nrecollections which must bind it still closer to your attachment and\r\naffection. It commenced its being and its blessings here. It was in this\r\ncity, in the midst of friends, anxious, hopeful, and devoted, that the\r\nnew government started in its course. To us, Gentlemen, who are younger,\r\nit has come down by tradition; but some around me are old enough to have\r\nwitnessed, and did witness, the interesting scene of the first\r\ninauguration. They remember what voices of gratified patriotism, what\r\nshouts of enthusiastic hope, what acclamations rent the air, how many\r\neyes were suffused with tears of joy, how cordially each man pressed the\r\nhand of him who was next to him, when, standing in the open air, in the\r\ncentre of the city, in the view of assembled thousands, the first\r\nPresident of the United States was heard solemnly to pronounce the words\r\nof his official oath, repeating them from the lips of Chancellor\r\nLivingston. You then thought, Gentlemen, that the great work of the\r\nRevolution was accomplished. You then felt that you had a government;\r\nthat the United States were then, indeed, united. Every benignant star\r\nseemed to shed its selectest influence on that auspicious hour. Here\r\nwere heroes of the Revolution; here were sages of the Convention; here\r\nwere minds, disciplined and schooled in all the various fortunes of the\r\ncountry, acting now in several relations, but all cooeperating to the\r\nsame great end, the successful administration of the new and untried\r\nConstitution. And he,--how shall I speak of him?--he was at the head,\r\nwho was already first in war, who was already first in the hearts of his\r\ncountrymen, and who was now shown also, by the unanimous suffrage of the\r\ncountry, to be first in peace.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, how gloriously have the hopes then indulged been fulfilled!\r\nWhose expectation was then so sanguine, I may almost ask, whose\r\nimagination then so extravagant, as to run forward, and contemplate\r\nas probable, the one half of what has been accomplished in forty\r\nyears? Who among you can go back to 1789, and see what this city, and\r\nthis country, too, then were; and, beholding what they now are, can be\r\nready to consent that the Constitution of the United States shall be\r\nweakened,--dishonored,--_nullified_?\r\n\r\nGentlemen, before I leave these pleasant recollections, I feel it an\r\nirresistible impulse of duty to pay a tribute of respect to another\r\ndistinguished person, not, indeed, a fellow-citizen of your own, but\r\nassociated with those I have already mentioned in important labors, and\r\nan early and indefatigable friend and advocate in the great cause of the\r\nConstitution. I refer to MR. MADISON. I am aware, Gentlemen, that a\r\ntribute of regard from me to him is of little importance; but if it\r\nshall receive your approbation and sanction, it will become of value.\r\nMr. Madison, thanks to a kind Providence, is yet among the living, and\r\nthere is certainly no other individual living, to whom the country is so\r\nmuch indebted for the blessings of the Constitution. He was one of the\r\ncommissioners who met at Annapolis, in 1786, to which meeting I have\r\nalready referred, and which, to the great credit of Virginia, had its\r\norigin in a proceeding of that State. He was a member of the Convention\r\nof 1787, and of that of Virginia in the following year. He was thus\r\nintimately acquainted with the whole progress of the formation of the\r\nConstitution, from its very first step to its final adoption. If ever\r\nman had the means of understanding a written instrument, Mr. Madison has\r\nthe means of understanding the Constitution. If it be possible to know\r\nwhat was designed by it, he can tell us. It was in this city, that, in\r\nconjunction with Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Jay, he wrote the numbers of the\r\nFederalist; and it was in this city that he commenced his brilliant\r\ncareer under the new Constitution, having been elected into the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the first Congress. The recorded votes and debates of\r\nthose times show his active and efficient agency in every important\r\nmeasure of that Congress. The necessary organization of the government,\r\nthe arrangement of the departments, and especially the paramount subject\r\nof revenue, engaged his attention, and divided his labors.\r\n\r\nThe legislative history of the first two or three years of the\r\ngovernment is full of instruction. It presents, in striking light, the\r\nevils intended to be remedied by the Constitution, and the provisions\r\nwhich were deemed essential to the remedy of those evils. It exhibits\r\nthe country, in the moment of its change from a weak and ill-defined\r\nconfederacy of States, into a general, efficient, but still restrained\r\nand limited government. It shows the first working of our peculiar\r\nsystem, moved, as it then was, by master hands.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, for one, I confess I like to dwell on this part of our\r\nhistory. It is good for us to be here. It is good for us to study the\r\nsituation of the country at this period, to survey its difficulties, to\r\nlook at the conduct of its public men, to see how they struggled with\r\nobstacles, real and formidable, and how gloriously they brought the\r\nUnion out of its state of depression and distress. Truly, Gentlemen,\r\nthese founders and fathers of the Constitution were great men, and\r\nthoroughly furnished for every good work. All that reading and learning\r\ncould do; all that talent and intelligence could do; and, what perhaps\r\nis still more, all that long experience in difficult and troubled times\r\nand a deep and intimate practical knowledge of the condition of the\r\ncountry could do,--conspired to fit them for the great business of\r\nforming a general, but limited government, embracing common objects,\r\nextending over all the States, and yet touching the power of the States\r\nno further than those common objects require. I confess I love to linger\r\naround these original fountains, and to drink deep of their waters. I\r\nlove to imbibe, in as full measure as I may, the spirit of those who\r\nlaid the foundations of the government, and so wisely and skilfully\r\nbalanced and adjusted its bearings and proportions.\r\n\r\nHaving been afterwards, for eight years, Secretary of State, and as\r\nlong President, Mr. Madison has had an experience in the affairs of the\r\nConstitution, certainly second to no man. More than any other man\r\nliving, and perhaps more than any other who has lived, his whole\r\npublic life has been incorporated, as it were, into the Constitution;\r\nin the original conception and project of attempting to form it, in its\r\nactual framing, in explaining and recommending it, by speaking and\r\nwriting, in assisting at the first organization of the government\r\nunder it, and in a long administration of its executive powers,--in\r\nthese various ways he has lived near the Constitution, and with the\r\npower of imbibing its true spirit, and inhaling its very breath, from\r\nits first pulsation of life. Again, therefore, I ask, If he cannot tell\r\nus what the Constitution is, and what it means, who can? He had\r\nretired with the respect and regard of the community, and might\r\nnaturally be supposed not willing to interfere again in matters of\r\npolitical concern. He has, nevertheless, not withholden his opinions on\r\nthe vital question discussed on that occasion, which has caused this\r\nmeeting. He has stated, with an accuracy almost peculiar to himself,\r\nand so stated as, in my opinion, to place almost beyond further\r\ncontroversy, the true doctrines of the Constitution. He has stated, not\r\nnotions too loose and irregular to be called even a theory, not ideas\r\nstruck out by the feeling of present inconvenience or supposed\r\nmal-administration, not suggestions of expediency, or evasions of\r\nfair and straightforward construction, but elementary principles,\r\nclear and sound distinctions, and indisputable truths. I am sure,\r\nGentlemen, that I speak your sentiments, as well as my own, when I\r\nsay, that, for making public so clearly and distinctly as he has done\r\nhis own opinions on these vial questions of constitutional law, Mr.\r\nMadison has founded a new and strong claim on the gratitude of a\r\ngrateful country. You will think, with me, that, at his advanced age,\r\nand in the enjoyment of general respect and approbation for a long\r\ncareer of public services, it was an act of distinguished patriotism,\r\nwhen he saw notions promulgated and maintained which he deemed unsound\r\nand dangerous, not to hesitate to come forward and to place the\r\nweight of his own opinion in what he deemed the right scale, come\r\nwhat come might. I am sure, Gentlemen, it cannot be doubted,--the\r\nmanifestation is clear,--that the country feels deeply the force of\r\nthis new obligation.[91]\r\n\r\nGentlemen, what I have said of the benefits of the Constitution to your\r\ncity might be said, with little change, in respect to every other part\r\nof the country. Its benefits are not exclusive. What has it left undone,\r\nwhich any government could do, for the whole country? In what condition\r\nhas it placed us? Where do we now stand? Are we elevated, or degraded,\r\nby its operation? What is our condition under its influence, at the very\r\nmoment when some talk of arresting its power and breaking its unity? Do\r\nwe not feel ourselves on an eminence? Do we not challenge the respect of\r\nthe whole world? What has placed us thus high? What has given us this\r\njust pride? What else is it, but the unrestrained and free operation of\r\nthat same Federal Constitution, which it has been proposed now to\r\nhamper, and manacle, and nullify? Who is there among us, that, should he\r\nfind himself on any spot of the earth where human beings exist, and\r\nwhere the existence of other nations is known, would not be proud to\r\nsay, I am an American? I am a countryman of Washington? I am a citizen\r\nof that republic, which, although it has suddenly sprung up, yet there\r\nare none on the globe who have ears to hear, and have not heard of it;\r\nwho have eyes to see, and have not read of it; who know any thing, and\r\nyet do not know of its existence and its glory? And, Gentlemen, let me\r\nnow reverse the picture. Let me ask, who there is among us, if he were\r\nto be found to-morrow in one of the civilized countries of Europe, and\r\nwere there to learn that this goodly form of government had been\r\noverthrown, that the United States were no longer united, that a\r\ndeath-blow had been struck upon their bond of union, that they\r\nthemselves had destroyed their chief good and their chief honor,--who is\r\nthere whose heart would not sink within him? Who is there who would not\r\ncover his face for very shame?\r\n\r\nAt this very moment, Gentlemen, our country is a general refuge for the\r\ndistressed and the persecuted of other nations. Whoever is in affliction\r\nfrom political occurrences in his own country looks here for shelter.\r\nWhether he be republican, flying from the oppression of thrones, or\r\nwhether he be monarch or monarchist, flying from thrones that crumble\r\nand fall under or around him, he feels equal assurance, that, if he get\r\nfoothold on our soil, his person will be safe, and his rights will be\r\nrespected.\r\n\r\nAnd who will venture to say, that, in any government now existing in the\r\nworld, there is greater security for persons or property than in that of\r\nthe United States? We have tried these popular institutions in times of\r\ngreat excitement and commotion, and they have stood, substantially, firm\r\nand steady, while the fountains of the great political deep have been\r\nelsewhere broken up; while thrones, resting on ages of prescription,\r\nhave tottered and fallen; and while, in other countries, the earthquake\r\nof unrestrained popular commotion has swallowed up all law, and all\r\nliberty, and all right together. Our government has been tried in peace,\r\nand it has been tried in war, and has proved itself fit for both. It has\r\nbeen assailed from without, and it has successfully resisted the shock;\r\nit has been disturbed within, and it has effectually quieted the\r\ndisturbance. It can stand trial, it can stand assault, it can stand\r\nadversity, it can stand every thing, but the marring of its own beauty,\r\nand the weakening of its own strength. It can stand every thing but the\r\neffects of our own rashness and our own folly. It can stand every thing\r\nbut disorganization, disunion, and nullification.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking fact, and as true as it is striking, that at this very\r\nmoment, among all the principal civilized states of the world, _that_\r\ngovernment is most secure against the danger of popular commotion which\r\nis itself entirely popular. It seems, indeed, that the submission of\r\nevery thing to the public will, under constitutional restraints, imposed\r\nby the people themselves, furnishes itself security that they will\r\ndesire nothing wrong.\r\n\r\nCertain it is, that popular, constitutional liberty, as we enjoy it,\r\nappears, in the present state of the world, as sure and stable a basis\r\nfor government to rest upon, as any government of enlightened states can\r\nfind, or does find. Certain it is, that, in these times of so much\r\npopular knowledge, and so much popular activity, those governments which\r\ndo not admit the people to partake in their administration, but keep\r\nthem under and beneath, sit on materials for an explosion, which may\r\ntake place at any moment, and blow them into a thousand atoms.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, let any man who would degrade and enfeeble the national\r\nConstitution, let any man who would nullify its laws, stand forth and\r\ntell us what he would wish. What does he propose? Whatever he may be,\r\nand whatever substitute he may hold forth, I am sure the people of this\r\ncountry will decline his kind interference, and hold on by the\r\nConstitution which they possess. Any one who would willingly destroy it,\r\nI rejoice to know, would be looked upon with abhorrence. It is deeply\r\nintrenched in the regards of the people. Doubtless it may be undermined\r\nby artful and long-continued hostility; it may be imperceptibly weakened\r\nby secret attack; it may be insidiously shorn of its powers by slow\r\ndegrees; the public vigilance may be lulled, and when it awakes, it may\r\nfind the Constitution frittered away. In these modes, or some of them,\r\nit is possible that the union of the States may be dissolved.\r\n\r\nBut if the general attention of the people be kept alive, if they see\r\nthe intended mischief before it is effected, they will prevent it by\r\ntheir own sovereign power. They will interpose themselves between the\r\nmeditated blow and the object of their regard and attachment. Next to\r\nthe controlling authority of the people themselves, the preservation of\r\nthe government is mainly committed to those who administer it. If\r\nconducted in wisdom, it cannot but stand strong. Its genuine, original\r\nspirit is a patriotic, liberal, and generous spirit; a spirit of\r\nconciliation, of moderation, of candor, and charity; a spirit of\r\nfriendship, and not a spirit of hostility toward the States; a spirit\r\ncareful not to exceed, and equally careful not to relinquish, its just\r\npowers. While no interest can or ought to feel itself shut out from the\r\nbenefits of the Constitution, none should consider those benefits as\r\nexclusively its own. The interests of all must be consulted, and\r\nreconciled, and provided for, as far as possible, that all may perceive\r\nthe benefits of a united government.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, we are to remember that new States have arisen,\r\npossessing already an immense population, spreading and thickening over\r\nvast regions which were a wilderness when the Constitution was adopted.\r\nThose States are not, like New York, directly connected with maritime\r\ncommerce. They are entirely agricultural, and need markets for\r\nconsumption; and they need, too, access to those markets. It is the duty\r\nof the government to bring the interests of these new States into the\r\nUnion, and incorporate them closely in the family compact. Gentlemen, it\r\nis not impracticable to reconcile these various interests, and so to\r\nadminister the government as to make it useful to all. It was never\r\neasier to administer the government than it is now. We are beset with\r\nnone, or with few, of its original difficulties; and it is a time of\r\ngreat general prosperity and happiness. Shall we admit ourselves\r\nincompetent to carry on the government, so as to be satisfactory to the\r\nwhole country? Shall we admit that there has so little descended to us\r\nof the wisdom and prudence of our fathers? If the government could be\r\nadministered in Washington's time, when it was yet new, when the country\r\nwas heavily in debt, when foreign relations were in a threatening\r\ncondition, and when Indian wars pressed on the frontiers, can it not be\r\nadministered now? Let us not acknowledge ourselves so unequal to our\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, on the occasion referred to by the chair, it became necessary\r\nto consider the judicial power, and its proper functions under the\r\nConstitution. In every free and balanced government, this is a most\r\nessential and important power. Indeed, I think it is a remark of Mr.\r\nHume, that the administration of justice seems to be the leading object\r\nof institutions of government; that legislatures assemble, that armies\r\nare embodied, that both war and peace are made, with a sort of ultimate\r\nreference to the proper administration of laws, and the judicial\r\nprotection of private rights. The judicial power comes home to every\r\nman. If the legislature passes incorrect or unjust general laws, its\r\nmembers bear the evil as well as others. But judicature acts on\r\nindividuals. It touches every private right, every private interest, and\r\nalmost every private feeling. What we possess is hardly fit to be called\r\nour own, unless we feel secure in its possession; and this security,\r\nthis feeling of perfect safety, cannot exist under a wicked, or even\r\nunder a weak and ignorant, administration of the laws. There is no\r\nhappiness, there is no liberty, there is no enjoyment of life, unless a\r\nman can say when he rises in the morning, I shall be subject to the\r\ndecision of no unjust judge to-day.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, the judicial department, under the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, possesses still higher duties. It is true, that it may be\r\ncalled on, and is occasionally called on, to decide questions which are,\r\nin one sense, of a political nature. The general and State governments,\r\nboth established by the people, are established for different purposes,\r\nand with different powers. Between those powers questions may arise; and\r\nwho shall decide them? Some provision for this end is absolutely\r\nnecessary. What shall it be? This was the question before the\r\nConvention; and various schemes were suggested. It was foreseen that the\r\nStates might inadvertently pass laws inconsistent with the Constitution\r\nof the United States, or with acts of Congress. At least, laws might be\r\npassed which would be charged with such inconsistency. How should these\r\nquestions be disposed of? Where shall the power of judging, in cases of\r\nalleged interference, be lodged? One suggestion in the Convention was,\r\nto make it an executive power, and to lodge it in the hands of the\r\nPresident, by requiring all State laws to be submitted to him, that he\r\nmight negative such as he thought appeared repugnant to the general\r\nConstitution. This idea, perhaps, may have been borrowed from the power\r\nexercised by the crown over the laws of the Colonies. It would evidently\r\nhave been, not only an inconvenient and troublesome proceeding, but\r\ndangerous also to the powers of the States. It was not pressed. It was\r\nthought wiser and safer, on the whole, to require State legislatures and\r\nState judges to take an oath to support the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, and then leave the States at liberty to pass whatever laws they\r\npleased, and if interference, in point of fact, should arise, to refer\r\nthe question to judicial decision. To this end, the judicial power,\r\nunder the Constitution of the United States, was made coextensive with\r\nthe legislative power. It was extended to all cases arising under the\r\nConstitution and the laws of Congress. The judiciary became thus\r\npossessed of the authority of deciding, in the last resort, in all cases\r\nof alleged interference, between State laws and the Constitution and\r\nlaws of Congress.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, this is the actual Constitution, this is the law of the land.\r\nThere may be those who think it unnecessary, or who would prefer a\r\ndifferent mode of deciding such questions. But this is the established\r\nmode, and, till it be altered, the courts can no more decline their duty\r\non these occasions than on other occasions. But can any reasonable man\r\ndoubt the expediency of this provision, or suggest a better? Is it not\r\nabsolutely essential to the peace of the country that this power should\r\nexist somewhere? Where can it exist, better than where it now does\r\nexist? The national judiciary is the common tribunal of the whole\r\ncountry. It is organized by the common authority, and its places filled\r\nby the common agent. This is a plain and practical provision. It was\r\nframed by no bunglers, nor by any wild theorists. And who can say that\r\nit has failed? Who can find substantial fault with its operation or its\r\nresults? The great question is, whether we shall provide for the\r\npeaceable decision of cases of collision. Shall they be decided by law,\r\nor by force? Shall the decisions be decisions of peace, or decisions of\r\nwar?\r\n\r\nOn the occasion which has given rise to this meeting, the proposition\r\ncontended for in opposition to the doctrine just stated was, that every\r\nState, under certain supposed exigencies, and in certain supposed cases,\r\nmight decide for itself, and act for itself, and oppose its own force to\r\nthe execution of the laws. By what argument, do you imagine, Gentlemen,\r\nwas such a proposition maintained? I should call it metaphysical and\r\nsubtle; but these terms would imply at least ingenuity, and some degree\r\nof plausibility; whereas the argument appears to me plain assumption,\r\nmere perverse construction of plain language in the body of the\r\nConstitution itself. As I understand it, when put forth in its revised\r\nand most authentic shape, it is this: that the Constitution provides\r\nthat any amendments may be made to it which shall be agreed to by three\r\nfourths of the States; there is, therefore, to be nothing in the\r\nConstitution to which three fourths of the States have not agreed. All\r\nthis is true; but then comes this inference, namely, that, when one\r\nState denies the constitutionality of any law of Congress, she may\r\narrest its execution as to herself; and keep it arrested, till the\r\nStates can all be consulted by their conventions, and three fourths of\r\nthem shall have decided that the law is constitutional. Indeed, the\r\ninference is still stranger than this; for State conventions have no\r\nauthority to construe the Constitution, though they have authority to\r\namend it; therefore the argument must prove, if it prove any thing,\r\nthat, when any one State denies that any particular power is included in\r\nthe Constitution, it is to be considered as not included, and cannot be\r\nfound there till three fourths of the States agree to insert it. In\r\nshort, the result of the whole is, that, though it requires three\r\nfourths of the States to insert any thing in the Constitution, yet any\r\none State can strike any thing out of it. For the power to strike out,\r\nand the power of deciding, without appeal, upon the construction of what\r\nis already in, are substantially and practically the same.\r\n\r\nAnd, Gentlemen, what a spectacle should we have exhibited under the\r\nactual operation of notions like these! At the very moment when our\r\ngovernment was quoted, praised, and commended all over the world, when\r\nthe friends of republican liberty everywhere were gazing at it with\r\ndelight, and were in perfect admiration at the harmony of its movements,\r\none State steps forth, and, by the power of nullification, breaks up the\r\nwhole system, and scatters the bright chain of the Union into as many\r\nsundered links as there are separate States!\r\n\r\nSeeing the true grounds of the Constitution thus attacked, I raised my\r\nvoice in its favor, I must confess with no preparation or previous\r\nintention. I can hardly say that I embarked in the contest from a sense\r\nof duty. It was an instantaneous impulse of inclination, not acting\r\nagainst duty, I trust, but hardly waiting for its suggestions. I felt it\r\nto be a contest for the integrity of the Constitution, and I was ready\r\nto enter into it, not thinking, or caring, personally, how I might come\r\nout.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have true pleasure in saying that I trust the crisis has in\r\nsome measure passed by. The doctrines of nullification have received a\r\nsevere and stern rebuke from public opinion. The general reprobation of\r\nthe country has been cast upon them. Recent expressions of the most\r\nnumerous branch of the national legislature are decisive and imposing.\r\nEverywhere, the general tone of public feeling is for the Constitution.\r\nWhile much will be yielded--every thing, almost, but the integrity of\r\nthe Constitution, and the essential interests of the country--to the\r\ncause of mutual harmony and mutual conciliation, no ground can be\r\ngranted, not an inch, to menace and bluster. Indeed, menace and bluster,\r\nand the putting forth of daring, unconstitutional doctrines, are, at\r\nthis very moment, the chief obstacles to mutual harmony and satisfactory\r\naccommodation. Men cannot well reason, and confer, and take counsel\r\ntogether, about the discreet exercise of a power, with those who deny\r\nthat any such power rightfully exists, and who threaten to blow up the\r\nwhole Constitution if they cannot otherwise get rid of its operation.\r\nIt is matter of sincere gratification, Gentlemen, that the voice of this\r\ngreat State has been so clear and strong, and her vote all but\r\nunanimous, on the most interesting of these occasions, in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Certainly, such respect to the Union becomes New York.\r\nIt is consistent with her interests and her character. That singularly\r\nprosperous State, which now is, and is likely to continue to be, the\r\ngreatest link in the chain of the Union, will ever be, I am sure, the\r\nstrongest link also. The great States which lie in her neighborhood\r\nagreed with her fully in this matter. Pennsylvania, I believe, was loyal\r\nto the Union, to a man; and Ohio raises her voice, like that of a lion,\r\nagainst whatsoever threatens disunion and dismemberment. This harmony of\r\nsentiment is truly gratifying. It is not to be gainsaid, that the union\r\nof opinion in this great central mass of our population, on this\r\nmomentous point of the Constitution, augurs well for our future\r\nprosperity and security.\r\n\r\nI have said, Gentlemen, what I verily believe to be true, that there is\r\nno danger to the Union from open and avowed attacks on its essential\r\nprinciples. Nothing is to be feared from those who will march up boldly\r\nto their own propositions, and tell us that they mean to annihilate\r\npowers exercised by Congress. But, certainly, there are dangers to the\r\nConstitution, and we ought not to shut our eyes to them. We know the\r\nimportance of a firm and intelligent judiciary; but how shall we secure\r\nthe continuance of a firm and intelligent judiciary? Gentlemen, the\r\njudiciary is in the appointment of the executive power. It cannot\r\ncontinue or renew itself. Its vacancies are to be filled in the ordinary\r\nmodes of executive appointment. If the time shall ever come (which\r\nHeaven avert), when men shall be placed in the supreme tribunal of the\r\ncountry, who entertain opinions hostile to the just powers of the\r\nConstitution, we shall then be visited by an evil defying all remedy.\r\nOur case will be past surgery. From that moment the Constitution is at\r\nan end. If they who are appointed to defend the castle shall betray it,\r\nwoe betide those within! If I live to see that day come, I shall despair\r\nof the country. I shall be prepared to give it back to all its former\r\nafflictions, in the days of the Confederation. I know no security\r\nagainst the possibility of this evil, but an awakened public vigilance.\r\nI know no safety, but in that state of public opinion which shall lead\r\nit to rebuke and put down every attempt, either to gratify party by\r\njudicial appointments, or to dilute the Constitution by creating a court\r\nwhich shall construe away its provisions. If members of Congress betray\r\ntheir trust, the people will find it out before they are ruined. If the\r\nPresident should at any time violate his duty, his term of office is\r\nshort, and popular elections may supply a seasonable remedy. But the\r\njudges of the Supreme Court possess, for very good reasons, an\r\nindependent tenure of office. No election reaches them. If, with this\r\ntenure, they betray their trusts, Heaven save us! Let us hope for better\r\nresults. The past, certainly, may encourage us. Let us hope that we\r\nshall never see the time when there shall exist such an awkward posture\r\nof affairs, as that the government shall be found in opposition to the\r\nConstitution, and when the guardians of the Union shall become its\r\nbetrayers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGentlemen, our country stands, at the present time, on commanding\r\nground. Older nations, with different systems of government, may be\r\nsomewhat slow to acknowledge all that justly belongs to us. But we may\r\nfeel without vanity, that America is doing her part in the great work of\r\nimproving human affairs. There are two principles, Gentlemen, strictly\r\nand purely American, which are now likely to prevail throughout the\r\ncivilized world. Indeed, they seem the necessary result of the progress\r\nof civilization and knowledge. These are, first, popular governments,\r\nrestrained by written constitutions; and, secondly, universal education.\r\nPopular governments and general education, acting and reacting, mutually\r\nproducing and reproducing each other, are the mighty agencies which in\r\nour days appear to be exciting, stimulating, and changing civilized\r\nsocieties. Man, everywhere, is now found demanding a participation in\r\ngovernment,--and he will not be refused; and he demands knowledge as\r\nnecessary to self-government. On the basis of these two principles,\r\nliberty and knowledge, our own American systems rest. Thus far we have\r\nnot been disappointed in their results. Our existing institutions,\r\nraised on these foundations, have conferred on us almost unmixed\r\nhappiness. Do we hope to better our condition by change? When we shall\r\nhave nullified the present Constitution, what are we to receive in its\r\nplace? As fathers, do we wish for our children better government, or\r\nbetter laws? As members of society, as lovers of our country, is there\r\nany thing we can desire for it better than that, as ages and centuries\r\nroll over it, it may possess the same invaluable institutions which it\r\nnow enjoys? For my part, Gentlemen, I can only say, that I desire to\r\nthank the beneficent Author of all good for being born _where_ I was\r\nborn, and _when_ I was born; that the portion of human existence\r\nallotted to me has been meted out to me in this goodly land, and at this\r\ninteresting period. I rejoice that I have lived to see so much\r\ndevelopment of truth, so much progress of liberty, so much diffusion of\r\nvirtue and happiness. And, through good report and evil report, it will\r\nbe my consolation to be a citizen of a republic unequalled in the annals\r\nof the world for the freedom of its institutions, its high prosperity,\r\nand the prospects of good which yet lie before it. Our course,\r\nGentlemen, is onward, straight onward, and forward. Let us not turn to\r\nthe right hand, nor to the left. Our path is marked out for us, clear,\r\nplain, bright, distinctly defined, like the milky way across the\r\nheavens. If we are true to our country, in our day and generation, and\r\nthose who come after us shall be true to it also, assuredly, assuredly,\r\nwe shall elevate her to a pitch of prosperity and happiness, of honor\r\nand power, never yet reached by any nation beneath the sun.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, before I resume my seat, a highly gratifying duty remains\r\nto be performed. In signifying your sentiments of regard, you have\r\nkindly chosen to select as your organ for expressing them the\r\neminent person[92] near whom I stand. I feel, I cannot well say how\r\nsensibly, the manner in which he has seen fit to speak on this\r\noccasion. Gentlemen, if I may be supposed to have made any attainment\r\nin the knowledge of constitutional law, he is among the masters in\r\nwhose schools I have been taught. You see near him a distinguished\r\nmagistrate,[93] long associated with him in judicial labors, which\r\nhave conferred lasting benefits and lasting character, not only on\r\nthe State, but on the whole country. Gentlemen, I acknowledge myself\r\nmuch their debtor. While yet a youth, unknown, and with little\r\nexpectation of becoming known beyond a very limited circle, I have\r\npassed days and nights, not of tedious, but of happy and gratified\r\nlabor, in the study of the judicature of the State of New York. I am\r\nmost happy to have this public opportunity of acknowledging the\r\nobligation, and of repaying it as far as it can be repaid, by the poor\r\ntribute of my profound regard, and the earnest expression of my\r\nsincere respect.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I will no longer detain you than to propose a toast:--\r\n\r\nThe City of New York; herself the noblest eulogy on the Union of the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [90] Address to the People of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n   [91] The reference is to Mr. Madison's letter on the subject of\r\n        _Nullification_, in the North American Review, Vol. XXXI. p.\r\n        537.\r\n\r\n   [92] Chancellor Kent, the presiding officer.\r\n\r\n   [93] Judge Spencer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON.[94]\r\n\r\n  On the 22d of February, 1832, being the centennial birthday of\r\n  GEORGE WASHINGTON, a number of gentlemen, members of Congress and\r\n  others, from different parts of the Union, united in commemorating\r\n  the occasion by a public dinner in the city of Washington.\r\n\r\n  At the request of the Committee of Arrangements, Mr. Webster, then a\r\n  Senator from Massachusetts, occupied the chair. After the cloth was\r\n  removed, he addressed the company in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\r\nI rise, Gentlemen, to propose to you the name of that great man, in\r\ncommemoration of whose birth, and in honor of whose character and\r\nservices, we are here assembled.\r\n\r\nI am sure that I express a sentiment common to every one present, when I\r\nsay that there is something more than ordinarily solemn and affecting in\r\nthis occasion.\r\n\r\nWe are met to testify our regard for him whose name is intimately\r\nblended with whatever belongs most essentially to the prosperity, the\r\nliberty, the free institutions, and the renown of our country. That name\r\nwas of power to rally a nation, in the hour of thick-thronging public\r\ndisasters and calamities; that name shone, amid the storm of war, a\r\nbeacon light, to cheer and guide the country's friends; it flamed, too,\r\nlike a meteor, to repel her foes. That name, in the days of peace, was a\r\nload-stone, attracting to itself a whole people's confidence, a whole\r\npeople's love, and the whole world's respect. That name, descending with\r\nall time, spreading over the whole earth, and uttered in all the\r\nlanguages belonging to the tribes and races of men, will for ever be\r\npronounced with affectionate gratitude by every one in whose breast\r\nthere shall arise an aspiration for human rights and human liberty.\r\n\r\nWe perform this grateful duty, Gentlemen, at the expiration of a hundred\r\nyears from his birth, near the place, so cherished and beloved by him,\r\nwhere his dust now reposes, and in the capital which bears his own\r\nimmortal name.\r\n\r\nAll experience evinces that human sentiments are strongly influenced by\r\nassociations. The recurrence of anniversaries, or of longer periods of\r\ntime, naturally freshens the recollection, and deepens the impression,\r\nof events with which they are historically connected. Renowned places,\r\nalso, have a power to awaken feeling, which all acknowledge. No American\r\ncan pass by the fields of Bunker Hill, Monmouth, and Camden, as if they\r\nwere ordinary spots on the earth's surface. Whoever visits them feels\r\nthe sentiment of love of country kindling anew, as if the spirit that\r\nbelonged to the transactions which have rendered these places\r\ndistinguished still hovered round, with power to move and excite all who\r\nin future time may approach them.\r\n\r\nBut neither of these sources of emotion equals the power with which\r\ngreat moral examples affect the mind. When sublime virtues cease to be\r\nabstractions, when they become embodied in human character, and\r\nexemplified in human conduct, we should be false to our own nature, if\r\nwe did not indulge in the spontaneous effusions of our gratitude and our\r\nadmiration. A true lover of the virtue of patriotism delights to\r\ncontemplate its purest models; and that love of country may be well\r\nsuspected which affects to soar so high into the regions of sentiment as\r\nto be lost and absorbed in the abstract feeling, and becomes too\r\nelevated or too refined to glow with fervor in the commendation or the\r\nlove of individual benefactors. All this is unnatural. It is as if one\r\nshould be so enthusiastic a lover of poetry, as to care nothing for\r\nHomer or Milton; so passionately attached to eloquence as to be\r\nindifferent to Tully and Chatham; or such a devotee to the arts, in such\r\nan ecstasy with the elements of beauty, proportion, and expression, as\r\nto regard the masterpieces of Raphael and Michael Angelo with coldness\r\nor contempt. We may be assured, Gentlemen, that he who really loves the\r\nthing itself, loves its finest exhibitions. A true friend of his country\r\nloves her friends and benefactors, and thinks it no degradation to\r\ncommend and commemorate them. The voluntary outpouring of the public\r\nfeeling, made to-day, from the North to the South, and from the East to\r\nthe West, proves this sentiment to be both just and natural. In the\r\ncities and in the villages, in the public temples and in the family\r\ncircles, among all ages and sexes, gladdened voices to-day bespeak\r\ngrateful hearts and a freshened recollection of the virtues of the\r\nFather of his Country. And it will be so, in all time to come, so long\r\nas public virtue is itself an object of regard. The ingenuous youth of\r\nAmerica will hold up to themselves the bright model of Washington's\r\nexample, and study to be what they behold; they will contemplate his\r\ncharacter till all its virtues spread out and display themselves to\r\ntheir delighted vision; as the earliest astronomers, the shepherds on\r\nthe plains of Babylon, gazed at the stars till they saw them form into\r\nclusters and constellations, overpowering at length the eyes of the\r\nbeholders with the united blaze of a thousand lights.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, we are at the point of a century from the birth of\r\nWashington; and what a century it has been! During its course, the human\r\nmind has seemed to proceed with a sort of geometric velocity,\r\naccomplishing, for human intelligence and human freedom, more than had\r\nbeen done in fives or tens of centuries preceding. Washington stands at\r\nthe commencement of a new era, as well as at the head of the New World.\r\nA century from the birth of Washington has changed the world. The\r\ncountry of Washington has been the theatre on which a great part of that\r\nchange has been wrought; and Washington himself a principal agent by\r\nwhich it has been accomplished. His age and his country are equally full\r\nof wonders; and of both he is the chief.\r\n\r\nIf the poetical prediction, uttered a few years before his birth, be\r\ntrue; if indeed it be designed by Providence that the grandest\r\nexhibition of human character and human affairs shall be made on this\r\ntheatre of the Western world; if it be true that,\r\n\r\n  \"The four first acts already past,\r\n  A fifth shall close the drama of the day;\r\n  Time's noblest offspring is the last\";\r\n\r\nhow could this imposing, swelling, final scene be appropriately opened,\r\nhow could its intense interest be adequately sustained, but by the\r\nintroduction of just such a character as our Washington?\r\n\r\nWashington had attained his manhood when that spark of liberty was\r\nstruck out in his own country, which has since kindled into a flame, and\r\nshot its beams over the earth. In the flow of a century from his birth,\r\nthe world has changed in science, in arts, in the extent of commerce, in\r\nthe improvement of navigation, and in all that relates to the\r\ncivilization of man. But it is the spirit of human freedom, the new\r\nelevation of individual man, in his moral, social, and political\r\ncharacter, leading the whole long train of other improvements, which has\r\nmost remarkably distinguished the era. Society, in this century, has not\r\nmade its progress, like Chinese skill, by a greater acuteness of\r\ningenuity in trifles; it has not merely lashed itself to an increased\r\nspeed round the old circles of thought and action; but it has assumed a\r\nnew character; it has raised itself from _beneath_ governments to a\r\nparticipation _in_ governments; it has mixed moral and political objects\r\nwith the daily pursuits of individual men; and, with a freedom and\r\nstrength before altogether unknown, it has applied to these objects the\r\nwhole power of the human understanding. It has been the era, in short,\r\nwhen the social principle has triumphed over the feudal principle; when\r\nsociety has maintained its rights against military power, and\r\nestablished, on foundations never hereafter to be shaken, its competency\r\nto govern itself.\r\n\r\nIt was the extraordinary fortune of Washington, that, having been\r\nintrusted, in revolutionary times, with the supreme military command,\r\nand having fulfilled that trust with equal renown for wisdom and for\r\nvalor, he should be placed at the head of the first government in\r\nwhich an attempt was to be made on a large scale to rear the fabric of\r\nsocial order on the basis of a written constitution and of a pure\r\nrepresentative principle. A government was to be established,\r\nwithout a throne, without an aristocracy, without castes, orders, or\r\nprivileges; and this government, instead of being a democracy, existing\r\nand acting within the walls of a single city, was to be extended over\r\na vast country, of different climates, interests, and habits, and of\r\nvarious communions of our common Christian faith. The experiment\r\ncertainly was entirely new. A popular government of this extent, it\r\nwas evident, could be framed only by carrying into full effect the\r\nprinciple of representation or of delegated power; and the world was to\r\nsee whether society could, by the strength of this principle, maintain\r\nits own peace and good government, carry forward its own great\r\ninterests, and conduct itself to political renown and glory. By the\r\nbenignity of Providence, this experiment, so full of interest to us and\r\nto our posterity for ever, so full of interest, indeed, to the world\r\nin its present generation and in all its generations to come, was\r\nsuffered to commence under the guidance of Washington. Destined for this\r\nhigh career, he was fitted for it by wisdom, by virtue, by patriotism,\r\nby discretion, by whatever can inspire confidence in man toward man.\r\nIn entering on the untried scenes, early disappointment and the\r\npremature extinction of all hope of success would have been certain, had\r\nit not been that there did exist throughout the country, in a most\r\nextraordinary degree, an unwavering trust in him who stood at the helm.\r\n\r\nI remarked, Gentlemen, that the whole world was and is interested in the\r\nresult of this experiment. And is it not so? Do we deceive ourselves, or\r\nis it true that at this moment the career which this government is\r\nrunning is among the most attractive objects to the civilized world? Do\r\nwe deceive ourselves, or is it true that at this moment that love of\r\nliberty and that understanding of its true principles which are flying\r\nover the whole earth, as on the wings of all the winds, are really and\r\ntruly of American origin?\r\n\r\nAt the period of the birth of Washington, there existed in Europe no\r\npolitical liberty in large communities, except in the provinces of\r\nHolland, and except that England herself had set a great example, so far\r\nas it went, by her glorious Revolution of 1688. Everywhere else,\r\ndespotic power was predominant, and the feudal or military principle\r\nheld the mass of mankind in hopeless bondage. One half of Europe was\r\ncrushed beneath the Bourbon sceptre, and no conception of political\r\nliberty, no hope even of religious toleration, existed among that nation\r\nwhich was America's first ally. The king was the state, the king was the\r\ncountry, the king was all. There was one king, with power not derived\r\nfrom his people, and too high to be questioned; and the rest were all\r\nsubjects, with no political right but obedience. All above was\r\nintangible power, all below quiet subjection. A recent occurrence in the\r\nFrench Chambers shows us how public opinion on these subjects is\r\nchanged. A minister had spoken of the \"king's subjects.\" \"There are no\r\nsubjects,\" exclaimed hundreds of voices at once, \"in a country where the\r\npeople make the king!\"\r\n\r\nGentlemen, the spirit of human liberty and of free government, nurtured\r\nand grown into strength and beauty in America, has stretched its course\r\ninto the midst of the nations. Like an emanation from Heaven, it has\r\ngone forth, and it will not return void. It must change, it is fast\r\nchanging, the face of the earth. Our great, our high duty is to show, in\r\nour own example, that this spirit is a spirit of health as well as a\r\nspirit of power; that its benignity is as great as its strength; that\r\nits efficiency to secure individual rights, social relations, and moral\r\norder, is equal to the irresistible force with which it prostrates\r\nprincipalities and powers. The world, at this moment, is regarding us\r\nwith a willing, but something of a fearful admiration. Its deep and\r\nawful anxiety is to learn whether free states may be stable, as well as\r\nfree; whether popular power may be trusted, as well as feared; in short,\r\nwhether wise, regular, and virtuous self-government is a vision for the\r\ncontemplation of theorists, or a truth established, illustrated, and\r\nbrought into practice in the country of Washington.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, for the earth which we inhabit, and the whole circle of the\r\nsun, for all the unborn races of mankind, we seem to hold in our hands,\r\nfor their weal or woe, the fate of this experiment. If we fail, who\r\nshall venture the repetition? If our example shall prove to be one, not\r\nof encouragement, but of terror, not fit to be imitated, but fit only to\r\nbe shunned, where else shall the world look for free models? If this\r\ngreat _Western Sun_ be struck out of the firmament, at what other\r\nfountain shall the lamp of liberty hereafter be lighted? What other orb\r\nshall emit a ray to glimmer, even, on the darkness of the world?\r\n\r\nThere is no danger of our overrating or overstating the important part\r\nwhich we are now acting in human affairs. It should not flatter our\r\npersonal self-respect, but it should reanimate our patriotic virtues,\r\nand inspire us with a deeper and more solemn sense, both of our\r\nprivileges and of our duties. We cannot wish better for our country, nor\r\nfor the world, than that the same spirit which influenced Washington may\r\ninfluence all who succeed him; and that the same blessing from above,\r\nwhich attended his efforts, may also attend theirs.\r\n\r\nThe principles of Washington's administration are not left doubtful.\r\nThey are to be found in the Constitution itself, in the great measures\r\nrecommended and approved by him, in his speeches to Congress, and in\r\nthat most interesting paper, his Farewell Address to the People of the\r\nUnited States. The success of the government under his administration is\r\nthe highest proof of the soundness of these principles. And, after an\r\nexperience of thirty-five years, what is there which an enemy could\r\ncondemn? What is there which either his friends, or the friends of the\r\ncountry, could wish to have been otherwise? I speak, of course, of great\r\nmeasures and leading principles.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, all his measures were right in their intent. He\r\nstated the whole basis of his own great character, when he told the\r\ncountry, in the homely phrase of the proverb, that honesty is the best\r\npolicy. One of the most striking things ever said of him is, that \"_he\r\nchanged mankind's ideas of political greatness_.\"[95] To commanding\r\ntalents, and to success, the common elements of such greatness, he added\r\na disregard of self, a spotlessness of motive, a steady submission to\r\nevery public and private duty, which threw far into the shade the whole\r\ncrowd of vulgar great. The object of his regard was the whole country.\r\nNo part of it was enough to fill his enlarged patriotism. His love of\r\nglory, so far as that may be supposed to have influenced him at all,\r\nspurned every thing short of general approbation. It would have been\r\nnothing to him, that his partisans or his favorites outnumbered, or\r\noutvoted, or outmanaged, or outclamored, those of other leaders. He had\r\nno favorites; he rejected all partisanship; and, acting honestly for the\r\nuniversal good, he deserved, what he has so richly enjoyed, the\r\nuniversal love.\r\n\r\nHis principle it was to act right, and to trust the people for support;\r\nhis principle it was not to follow the lead of sinister and selfish\r\nends, nor to rely on the little arts of party delusion to obtain public\r\nsanction for such a course. Born for his country and for the world, he\r\ndid not give up to party what was meant for mankind. The consequence is,\r\nthat his fame is as durable as his principles, as lasting as truth and\r\nvirtue themselves. While the hundreds whom party excitement, and\r\ntemporary circumstances, and casual combinations, have raised into\r\ntransient notoriety, sink again, like thin bubbles, bursting and\r\ndissolving into the great ocean, Washington's fame is like the rock\r\nwhich bounds that ocean, and at whose feet its billows are destined to\r\nbreak harmlessly for ever.\r\n\r\nThe maxims upon which Washington conducted our foreign relations\r\nwere few and simple. The first was an entire and indisputable\r\nimpartiality towards foreign states. He adhered to this rule of\r\npublic conduct, against very strong inducements to depart from it, and\r\nwhen the popularity of the moment seemed to favor such a departure. In\r\nthe next place, he maintained true dignity and unsullied honor in all\r\ncommunications with foreign states. It was among the high duties\r\ndevolved upon him, to introduce our new government into the circle of\r\ncivilized states and powerful nations. Not arrogant or assuming, with\r\nno unbecoming or supercilious bearing, he yet exacted for it from all\r\nothers entire and punctilious respect. He demanded, and he obtained at\r\nonce, a standing of perfect equality for his country in the society\r\nof nations; nor was there a prince or potentate of his day, whose\r\npersonal character carried with it, into the intercourse of other\r\nstates, a greater degree of respect and veneration.\r\n\r\nHe regarded other nations only as they stood in political relations\r\nto us. With their internal affairs, their political parties and\r\ndissensions, he scrupulously abstained from all interference; and, on\r\nthe other hand, he repelled with spirit all such interference by others\r\nwith us or our concerns. His sternest rebuke, the most indignant\r\nmeasure of his whole administration, was aimed against such an\r\nattempted interference. He felt it as an attempt to wound the national\r\nhonor, and resented it accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe reiterated admonitions in his Farewell Address show his deep fears\r\nthat foreign influence would insinuate itself into our counsels through\r\nthe channels of domestic dissension, and obtain a sympathy with our own\r\ntemporary parties. Against all such dangers, he most earnestly entreats\r\nthe country to guard itself. He appeals to its patriotism, to its\r\nself-respect, to its own honor, to every consideration connected with\r\nits welfare and happiness, to resist, at the very beginning, all\r\ntendencies towards such connection of foreign interests with our own\r\naffairs. With a tone of earnestness nowhere else found, even in his last\r\naffectionate farewell advice to his countrymen, he says, \"Against the\r\ninsidious wiles of foreign influence, (I conjure you to believe me,\r\nfellow-citizens,) the jealousy of a free people ought to be _constantly_\r\nawake; since history and experience prove, that foreign influence is one\r\nof the most baneful foes of republican government.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, on the subject of foreign relations, Washington never forgot\r\nthat we had interests peculiar to ourselves. The primary political\r\nconcerns of Europe, he saw, did not affect us. We had nothing to do with\r\nher balance of power, her family compacts, or her successions to\r\nthrones. We were placed in a condition favorable to neutrality during\r\nEuropean wars, and to the enjoyment of all the great advantages of that\r\nrelation. \"Why, then,\" he asks us, \"why forego the advantages of so\r\npeculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground?\r\nWhy, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe,\r\nentangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition,\r\nrivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, Gentlemen, Washington's Farewell Address is full of truths\r\nimportant at all times, and particularly deserving consideration at the\r\npresent. With a sagacity which brought the future before him, and made\r\nit like the present, he saw and pointed out the dangers that even at\r\nthis moment most imminently threaten us. I hardly know how a greater\r\nservice of that kind could now be done to the community, than by a\r\nrenewed and wide diffusion of that admirable paper, and an earnest\r\ninvitation to every man in the country to reperuse and consider it. Its\r\npolitical maxims are invaluable; its exhortations to love of country and\r\nto brotherly affection among citizens, touching; and the solemnity with\r\nwhich it urges the observance of moral duties, and impresses the power\r\nof religious obligation, gives to it the highest character of truly\r\ndisinterested, sincere, parental advice.\r\n\r\nThe domestic policy of Washington found its pole-star in the avowed\r\nobjects of the Constitution itself. He sought so to administer that\r\nConstitution, as to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure\r\ndomestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the\r\ngeneral welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty. These were objects\r\ninteresting, in the highest degree, to the whole country, and his policy\r\nembraced the whole country.\r\n\r\nAmong his earliest and most important duties was the organization of the\r\ngovernment itself, the choice of his confidential advisers, and the\r\nvarious appointments to office. This duty, so important and delicate,\r\nwhen a whole government was to be organized, and all its offices for the\r\nfirst time filled, was yet not difficult to him; for he had no sinister\r\nends to accomplish, no clamorous partisans to gratify, no pledges to\r\nredeem, no object to be regarded but simply the public good. It was a\r\nplain, straightforward matter, a mere honest choice of good men for the\r\npublic service.\r\n\r\nHis own singleness of purpose, his disinterested patriotism, were\r\nevinced by the selection of his first cabinet, and by the manner in\r\nwhich he filled the seats of justice, and other places of high trust. He\r\nsought for men fit for offices; not for offices which might suit men.\r\nAbove personal considerations, above local considerations, above party\r\nconsiderations, he felt that he could only discharge the sacred trust\r\nwhich the country had placed in his hands, by a diligent inquiry after\r\nreal merit, and a conscientious preference of virtue and talent. The\r\nwhole country was the field of his selection. He explored that whole\r\nfield, looking only for whatever it contained most worthy and\r\ndistinguished. He was, indeed, most successful, and he deserved success\r\nfor the purity of his motives, the liberality of his sentiments, and his\r\nenlarged and manly policy.\r\n\r\nWashington's administration established the national credit, made\r\nprovision for the public debt, and for that patriotic army whose\r\ninterests and welfare were always so dear to him; and, by laws wisely\r\nframed, and of admirable effect, raised the commerce and navigation of\r\nthe country, almost at once, from depression and ruin to a state of\r\nprosperity. Nor were his eyes open to these interests alone. He viewed\r\nwith equal concern its agriculture and manufactures, and, so far as they\r\ncame within the regular exercise of the powers of this government, they\r\nexperienced regard and favor.\r\n\r\nIt should not be omitted, even in this slight reference to the general\r\nmeasures and general principles of the first President, that he saw and\r\nfelt the full value and importance of the judicial department of the\r\ngovernment. An upright and able administration of the laws he held to be\r\nalike indispensable to private happiness and public liberty. The temple\r\nof justice, in his opinion, was a sacred place, and he would profane\r\nand pollute it who should call any to minister in it, not spotless in\r\ncharacter, not incorruptible in integrity, not competent by talent and\r\nlearning, not a fit object of unhesitating trust.\r\n\r\nAmong other admonitions, Washington has left us, in his last\r\ncommunication to his country, an exhortation against the excesses of\r\nparty spirit. A fire not to be quenched, he yet conjures us not to fan\r\nand feed the flame. Undoubtedly, Gentlemen, it is the greatest danger of\r\nour system and of our time. Undoubtedly, if that system should be\r\noverthrown, it will be the work of excessive party spirit, acting on the\r\ngovernment, which is dangerous enough, or acting _in_ the government,\r\nwhich is a thousand times more dangerous; for government then becomes\r\nnothing but organized party, and, in the strange vicissitudes of human\r\naffairs, it may come at last, perhaps, to exhibit the singular paradox\r\nof government itself being in opposition to its own powers, at war with\r\nthe very elements of its own existence. Such cases are hopeless. As men\r\nmay be protected against murder, but cannot be guarded against suicide,\r\nso government may be shielded from the assaults of external foes, but\r\nnothing can save it when it chooses to lay violent hands on itself.\r\n\r\nFinally, Gentlemen, there was in the breast of Washington one sentiment\r\nso deeply felt, so constantly uppermost, that no proper occasion escaped\r\nwithout its utterance. From the letter which he signed in behalf of the\r\nConvention when the Constitution was sent out to the people, to the\r\nmoment when he put his hand to that last paper in which he addressed his\r\ncountrymen, the Union,--the Union was the great object of his thoughts.\r\nIn that first letter he tells them that, to him and his brethren of the\r\nConvention, union appears to be the greatest interest of every true\r\nAmerican; and in that last paper he conjures them to regard that unity\r\nof government which constitutes them one people as the very palladium of\r\ntheir prosperity and safety, and the security of liberty itself. He\r\nregarded the union of these States less as one of our blessings, than as\r\nthe great treasure-house which contained them all. Here, in his\r\njudgment, was the great magazine of all our means of prosperity; here,\r\nas he thought, and as every true American still thinks, are deposited\r\nall our animating prospects, all our solid hopes for future greatness.\r\nHe has taught us to maintain this union, not by seeking to enlarge the\r\npowers of the government, on the one hand, nor by surrendering them, on\r\nthe other; but by an administration of them at once firm and moderate,\r\npursuing objects truly national, and carried on in a spirit of justice\r\nand equity.\r\n\r\nThe extreme solicitude for the preservation of the Union, at all times\r\nmanifested by him, shows not only the opinion he entertained of its\r\nimportance, but his clear perception of those causes which were likely\r\nto spring up to endanger it, and which, if once they should overthrow\r\nthe present system, would leave little hope of any future beneficial\r\nreunion. Of all the presumptions indulged by presumptuous man, that is\r\none of the rashest which looks for repeated and favorable opportunities\r\nfor the deliberate establishment of a united government over distinct\r\nand widely extended communities. Such a thing has happened once in human\r\naffairs, and but once; the event stands out as a prominent exception to\r\nall ordinary history; and unless we suppose ourselves running into an\r\nage of miracles, we may not expect its repetition.\r\n\r\nWashington, therefore, could regard, and did regard, nothing as of\r\nparamount political interest, but the integrity of the Union itself.\r\nWith a united government, well administered, he saw that we had nothing\r\nto fear; and without it, nothing to hope. The sentiment is just, and its\r\nmomentous truth should solemnly impress the whole country. If we might\r\nregard our country as personated in the spirit of Washington, if we\r\nmight consider him as representing her, in her past renown, her present\r\nprosperity, and her future career, and as in that character demanding of\r\nus all to account for our conduct, as political men or as private\r\ncitizens, how should he answer him who has ventured to talk of disunion\r\nand dismemberment? Or how should he answer him who dwells perpetually on\r\nlocal interests, and fans every kindling flame of local prejudice? How\r\nshould he answer him who would array State against State, interest\r\nagainst interest, and party against party, careless of the continuance\r\nof that _unity of government which constitutes us one people_?\r\n\r\nThe political prosperity which this country has attained, and which it\r\nnow enjoys, has been acquired mainly through the instrumentality of the\r\npresent government. While this agent continues, the capacity of\r\nattaining to still higher degrees of prosperity exists also. We have,\r\nwhile this lasts, a political life capable of beneficial exertion, with\r\npower to resist or overcome misfortunes, to sustain us against the\r\nordinary accidents of human affairs, and to promote, by active efforts,\r\nevery public interest. But dismemberment strikes at the very being which\r\npreserves these faculties. It would lay its rude and ruthless hand on\r\nthis great agent itself. It would sweep away, not only what we possess,\r\nbut all power of regaining lost, or acquiring new possessions. It would\r\nleave the country, not only bereft of its prosperity and happiness, but\r\nwithout limbs, or organs, or faculties, by which to exert itself\r\nhereafter in the pursuit of that prosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\nOther misfortunes may be borne, or their effects overcome. If\r\ndisastrous war should sweep our commerce from the ocean, another\r\ngeneration may renew it; if it exhaust our treasury, future industry\r\nmay replenish it; if it desolate and lay waste our fields, still,\r\nunder a new cultivation, they will grow green again, and ripen to\r\nfuture harvests. It were but a trifle even if the walls of yonder\r\nCapitol were to crumble, if its lofty pillars should fall, and its\r\ngorgeous decorations be all covered by the dust of the valley. All\r\nthese might be rebuilt. But who shall reconstruct the fabric of\r\ndemolished government? Who shall rear again the well-proportioned\r\ncolumns of constitutional liberty? Who shall frame together the\r\nskilful architecture which unites national sovereignty with State\r\nrights, individual security, and public prosperity? No, if these\r\ncolumns fall, they will be raised not again. Like the Coliseum and\r\nthe Parthenon, they will be destined to a mournful, a melancholy\r\nimmortality. Bitterer tears, however, will flow over them, than were\r\never shed over the monuments of Roman or Grecian art; for they will be\r\nthe remnants of a more glorious edifice than Greece or Rome ever saw,\r\nthe edifice of constitutional American liberty.\r\n\r\nBut let us hope for better things. Let us trust in that gracious Being\r\nwho has hitherto held our country as in the hollow of his hand. Let us\r\ntrust to the virtue and the intelligence of the people, and to the\r\nefficacy of religious obligation. Let us trust to the influence of\r\nWashington's example. Let us hope that that fear of Heaven which expels\r\nall other fear, and that regard to duty which transcends all other\r\nregard, may influence public men and private citizens, and lead our\r\ncountry still onward in her happy career. Full of these gratifying\r\nanticipations and hopes, let us look forward to the end of that century\r\nwhich is now commenced. A hundred years hence, other disciples of\r\nWashington will celebrate his birth, with no less of sincere admiration\r\nthan we now commemorate it. When they shall meet, as we now meet, to do\r\nthemselves and him that honor, so surely as they shall see the blue\r\nsummits of his native mountains rise in the horizon, so surely as they\r\nshall behold the river on whose banks he lived, and on whose banks he\r\nrests, still flowing on toward the sea, so surely may they see, as we\r\nnow see, the flag of the Union floating on the top of the Capitol; and\r\nthen, as now, may the sun in his course visit no land more free, more\r\nhappy, more lovely, than this our own country!\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I propose--\"THE MEMORY OF GEORGE WASHINGTON.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the excellent speeches delivered by gentlemen on this interesting\r\noccasion, we cannot refrain from selecting for this publication, though\r\na little out of place, the appropriate, just, and classic remarks of Mr.\r\nRobbins.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster having retired, Mr. Chambers, being in the chair, called\r\nupon Mr. Robbins of Rhode Island; when Mr. Senator ROBBINS of that State\r\naddressed the company as follows:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"GENTLEMEN,--I beg leave to offer a sentiment; but first, with your\r\nindulgence, will offer a few remarks, not inappropriate, I hope, to the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n\"It is the peculiar good fortune of this country to have given birth to\r\na citizen, whose name everywhere produces a sentiment of regard for his\r\ncountry itself. In other countries, whenever or wherever this is spoken\r\nof to be praised, and with the highest praise, it is called the country\r\nof Washington. I believe there is no people, civilized or savage, in any\r\nplace, however remote, where the name of Washington has not been heard,\r\nand where it is not repeated with the fondest admiration. We are told,\r\nthat the Arab of the desert talks of Washington in his tent, and that\r\nhis name is familiar to the wandering Scythian. He seems, indeed, to be\r\nthe delight of human kind, as their beau ideal of human nature. 'Nil\r\noriturum alias, nil ortum tale fatentes.'\r\n\r\n\"No American, in any part of the world, but has found the regard\r\nfor himself increased by his connection with Washington, as his\r\nfellow-countryman; and who has not felt a pride, and had occasion to\r\nexult, in the fortunate connection?\r\n\r\n\"Half a century and more has now passed away since he came upon the\r\nstage, and his fame first broke upon the world; for it broke like the\r\nblaze of day from the rising sun,--almost as sudden, and seemingly as\r\nuniversal. The eventful period since that era has teemed with great men,\r\nwho have crossed the scene and passed off. Some of them have arrested\r\ngreat attention, very great; still Washington retains his preeminent\r\nplace in the minds of men, still his peerless name is cherished by them\r\nin the same freshness of delight as in the morn of its glory.\r\n\r\n\"History will keep her record of his fame; but history is not necessary\r\nto perpetuate it. In regions where history is not read, where letters\r\nare unknown, it lives, and will go down from age to age, in all future\r\ntime, in their traditionary lore.\r\n\r\n\"Who would exchange this fame, the common inheritance of our country,\r\nfor the fame of any individual which any country of any time can boast?\r\nI would not; with my sentiments, I could not.\r\n\r\n\"I recollect the first time I ever saw Washington: indeed, it is\r\nimpossible I should forget it, or recollect it without the liveliest\r\nemotion. I was then a child at school. The school was dismissed, and we\r\nwere told, that General Washington was expected in town that day, on his\r\nway to Cambridge, to take command of the American army. We, the\r\nchildren, were permitted to mingle with the people, who had assembled in\r\nmass to see him. I did see him; I riveted my eyes upon him; I could now,\r\nwere I master of the pencil, delineate with exact truth his form and\r\nfeatures, and every particular of his costume: so vivid are my\r\nrecollections. I can never forget the feelings his sublime presence\r\ninspired. How often, afterwards, when I came, in my studies, to learn\r\nthem, have I repeated and applied, as expressive of that feeling, these\r\nlines,--\r\n\r\n  \"Quem sese ore ferens! quam forti pectore et armis!\r\n  Credo equidem, nec vana fides, genus esse Deorum.\"\r\n\r\nHe did seem to me more than mortal. It is true this was young and\r\nignorant enthusiasm; but, though young and ignorant, it was not false;\r\nit was enthusiasm, which my riper judgment has always recognized as\r\njust; it was but the anticipated sentiment of the whole human kind.\r\n\r\n\"I now beg leave to offer this sentiment:--\r\n\r\n\"The written legacy of Washington to his countrymen,--a code of politics\r\nby which, and by which alone, as he believed, their union and their\r\nliberties can be made immortal.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [94] A Speech delivered at a Public Dinner in Honor of the Centennial\r\n        Birthday of Washington, on the 22d of February, 1832.\r\n\r\n   [95] See Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 122, 123.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL REPUBLICAN CONVENTION AT WORCESTER.[96]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. President,--I offer no apology for addressing the meeting. Holding,\r\nby the favor of the people of this Commonwealth, an important public\r\nsituation, I deem it no less than a part of my duty, at this interesting\r\nmoment, to make known my opinions on the state of public affairs, and,\r\nhowever I may have performed other duties, this, at least, it is my\r\npurpose, on the present occasion, fully to discharge. Not intending to\r\ncomment at length on all the subjects which now attract public\r\nattention, nor to discuss any thing in detail, I wish, nevertheless,\r\nbefore an assembly so large and respectable as the present, and through\r\nthem before the whole people of the State, to lay open, without reserve,\r\nmy own sentiments, hopes, and fears respecting the state and the\r\nprospects of our common country.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions which have been read from the chair express the opinion,\r\nthat the public good requires an effectual change, in the administration\r\nof the general government, both of measures and of men. In this opinion\r\nI heartily concur.\r\n\r\nMr. President, there is no citizen of the State, who, in principle and\r\nby habitual sentiment, is less disposed than myself to general\r\nopposition to government, or less desirous of frequent changes in its\r\nadministration. I entertain this feeling strongly, and at all times,\r\ntowards the government of the United States; because I have ever\r\nregarded the Federal Constitution as a frame of government so peculiar,\r\nand so delicate in its relations to the State governments, that it might\r\nbe in danger of overthrow, as well from an indiscriminate and wanton\r\nopposition, as from a weak or a wicked administration. But a case may\r\narise in which the government is no longer safe in the hands to which it\r\nhas been intrusted. It may come to be a question, not so much in what\r\nparticular manner, or according to what particular political opinions,\r\nthe government shall be administered, as whether the Constitution itself\r\nshall be preserved and maintained. Now, Sir, in my judgment, just such a\r\ncase and just such a question are at this moment before the American\r\npeople. Entertaining this sentiment, and thoroughly and entirely\r\nconvinced of its truth, I wish, as far as my humble power extends, to\r\nproduce in the people a more earnest attention to their public concerns.\r\nWith the people, and the people alone, lies any remedy for the past or\r\nany security for the future. No delegated power is equal to the exigency\r\nof the present crisis. No public servants, however able or faithful,\r\nhave ability to check or to stop the fearful tendency of things. It is a\r\ncase for sovereign interposition. The rescue, if it come at all, must\r\ncome from that power which no other on earth can resist. I earnestly\r\nwish, therefore, unimportant as my own opinions may be, and entitled, as\r\nI know they are, to no considerable regard, yet, since they are honest\r\nand sincere, and since they respect nothing less than dangers which\r\nappear to me to threaten the government and Constitution of the country,\r\nI fervently wish that I could now make them known, not only to this\r\nmeeting and to this State, but to every man in the Union. I take the\r\nhazard of the reputation of an alarmist; I cheerfully submit to the\r\nimputation of over-excited apprehension; I discard all fear of the cry\r\nof false prophecy, and I declare, that, in my judgment, not only the\r\ngreat interests of the country, but the Constitution itself, are in\r\nimminent peril, and that nothing can save either the one or the other\r\nbut that voice which has authority to say to the evils of misrule and\r\nmisgovernment, \"Hitherto shall ye come, but no further.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true, Sir, that it is the natural effect of a good constitution to\r\nprotect the people. But who shall protect the constitution? Who shall\r\nguard the guardian? What arm but the mighty arm of the people itself is\r\nable, in a popular government, to uphold public institutions? The\r\nconstitution itself is but the creature of the public will; and in every\r\ncrisis which threatens it, it must owe its security to the same power to\r\nwhich it owes its origin.\r\n\r\nThe appeal, therefore, is to the people; not to party nor to partisans,\r\nnot to professed politicians, not to those who have an interest in\r\noffice and place greater than their stake in the country, but to the\r\npeople, and the whole people; to those who, in regard to political\r\naffairs, have no wish but for a good government, and who have power to\r\naccomplish their own wishes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. President, are the principles and leading measures of the\r\nadministration hostile to the great interests of the country?\r\n\r\nAre they dangerous to the Constitution, and to the union of the States?\r\n\r\nIs there any prospect of a beneficial change of principles and measures,\r\nwithout a change of men?\r\n\r\nIs there reasonable ground to hope for such a change of men?\r\n\r\nOn these several questions, I desire to state my own convictions fully,\r\nthough as briefly as possible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs government is intended to be a practical institution, if it be wisely\r\nformed, the first and most natural test of its administration is the\r\neffect produced by it. Let us look, then, to the actual state of our\r\naffairs. Is it such as should follow a good administration of a good\r\nconstitution?\r\n\r\nSir, we see one State openly threatening to arrest the execution of the\r\nrevenue laws of the Union, by acts of her own. This proceeding is\r\nthreatened, not by irresponsible persons, but by those who fill her\r\nchief places of power and trust.\r\n\r\nIn another State, free citizens of the country are imprisoned, and held\r\nin prison, in defiance of a judgment of the Supreme Court, pronounced\r\nfor their deliverance. Immured in a dungeon, marked and patched as\r\nsubjects of penitentiary punishment, these free citizens pass their days\r\nin counting the slow-revolving hours of their miserable, captivity, and\r\ntheir nights in feverish and delusive dreams of their own homes and\r\ntheir own families; while the Constitution stands adjudged to be\r\nviolated, a law of Congress is effectually repealed by the act of a\r\nState, and a judgment of deliverance by the Supreme Court is set a\r\nnaught and contemned.[97]\r\n\r\nTreaties, importing the most solemn and sacred obligations, are denied\r\nto have binding force.\r\n\r\nA feeling that there is great insecurity for property, and the stability\r\nof the means of living, extensively prevails.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject of the tariff, acted on for the moment, is at the same\r\nmoment declared not to be at rest, but liable to be again moved, and\r\nwith greater effect, just so soon as power for that purpose shall be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe currency of the country, hitherto safe, sound, and universally\r\nsatisfactory, is threatened with a violent change; and an embarrassment\r\nin pecuniary affairs, equally distressing and unnecessary, hangs over\r\nall the trading and active classes of society.\r\n\r\nA long-used and long-approved legislative instrument for the collection\r\nof revenue, well secured against abuse, and always responsible to\r\nCongress and to the laws, is denied further existence; and its place is\r\nproposed to be supplied by a new branch of the executive department,\r\nwith a money power controlled and conducted solely by executive agency.\r\n\r\nThe power of the VETO is exercised, not as an extraordinary, but as an\r\nordinary power; as a common mode of defeating acts of Congress not\r\nacceptable to the executive. We hear, one day, that the President needs\r\nthe advice of no cabinet; that a few secretaries, or clerks, are enough\r\nfor him. The next, we are informed that the Supreme Court is but an\r\nobstacle to the popular will, and the whole judicial department but an\r\nencumbrance to government. And while, on one side, the judicial power is\r\nthus derided and denounced, on the other arises the cry, \"Cut down the\r\nSenate!\" and over the whole, at the same time, prevails the loud avowal,\r\nshouted with all the lungs of conscious party strength and party\r\ntriumph, that the spoils of the enemy belong to the victors. This\r\ncondition of things, Sir, this general and obvious aspect of affairs, is\r\nthe result of three years' administration, such as the country has\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nBut, not resting on this general view of results, let me inquire what\r\nthe principles and policy of the administration are, on the leading\r\ninterests of the country, subordinate to the Constitution itself. And\r\nfirst, what are its principles, and what its policy, respecting the\r\ntariff? Is this great question settled, or unsettled? And is the present\r\nadministration for, or against, the tariff?\r\n\r\nSir, the question is wholly unsettled, and the principles of the\r\nadministration, according to its most recent avowal of those\r\nprinciples, are adverse to the protective policy, decidedly hostile to\r\nthe whole system, root and branch; and this on permanent and alleged\r\nconstitutional grounds.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, nothing has been done to settle the tariff question.\r\nThe anti-tariff members of Congress who voted for the late law have,\r\nnone of them, said they would adhere to it. On the contrary, they\r\nsupported it, because, as far as it went, it was reduction, and that was\r\nwhat they wished; and if they obtained this degree of reduction now, it\r\nwould be easier to obtain a greater degree hereafter; and they frankly\r\ndeclared, that their intent and purpose was to insist on reduction, and\r\nto pursue reduction, unremittingly, till all duties on imports should be\r\nbrought down to one general and equal percentage, and that regulated by\r\nthe mere wants of the revenue; or, if different rates of duty should\r\nremain on different articles, still, that the whole should be laid for\r\nrevenue, and revenue only; and that they would, to the utmost of their\r\npower, push this course, till protection by duties, as a special object\r\nof national policy, should be abandoned altogether in the national\r\ncouncils. It is a delusion, therefore, Sir, to imagine that the present\r\ntariff stands, safely, on conceded ground. It covers not an inch that\r\nhas not been fought for, and must not be again fought for. It stands\r\nwhile its friends can protect it, and not an hour longer.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, in that compend of executive opinion contained in the\r\nveto message, the whole principle of the protective policy is plainly\r\nand pointedly denounced.\r\n\r\nHaving gone through its argument against the bank charter, as it now\r\nexists, and as it has existed, either under the present or a former law,\r\nfor near forty years, and having added to the well-doubted logic of that\r\nargument the still more doubtful aid of a large array of opprobrious\r\nepithets, the message, in unveiled allusion to the protective policy of\r\nthe country, holds this language:--\r\n\r\n  \"Most of the difficulties our government now encounters, and most of\r\n  the dangers which impend over our Union, have sprung from an\r\n  abandonment of the legitimate objects of government by our national\r\n  legislation, and the adoption of such principles as are embodied in\r\n  this act. Many of our rich men have not been content with equal\r\n  protection and equal benefits, but have besought us to make them\r\n  richer by act of Congress. By attempting to gratify their desires,\r\n  we have, in the results of our legislation, arrayed section against\r\n  section, interest against interest, and man against man, in a\r\n  fearful commotion which threatens to shake the foundations of our\r\n  Union. It is time to pause in our career, to review our principles,\r\n  and, if possible, revive that devoted patriotism and spirit of\r\n  compromise which distinguished the sages of the Revolution and the\r\n  fathers of our Union. If we cannot at once, in justice to interests\r\n  vested under improvident legislation, make our government what it\r\n  ought to be, we can at least take a stand against all new grants of\r\n  monopolies and exclusive privileges, against any prostitution of our\r\n  government to the advancement of the few at the expense of the many,\r\n  and in favor of compromise and gradual reform in our code of laws\r\n  and system of political economy.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have the whole creed. Our national legislature has\r\nabandoned the legitimate objects of government. It has adopted such\r\nprinciples as are embodied in the bank charter; and these principles are\r\nelsewhere called objectionable, odious, and unconstitutional. All this\r\nhas been done, because rich men have besought the government to render\r\nthem richer by acts of Congress. It is time to pause in our career. It\r\nis time _to review these principles_. And if we cannot at once MAKE OUR\r\nGOVERNMENT WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE, we can, at least, take a stand against\r\nnew grants of power and privilege.\r\n\r\nThe plain meaning of all this is, that our protecting laws are founded\r\nin an abandonment of the legitimate objects of government; that this is\r\nthe great source of our difficulties; that it is time to stop in our\r\ncareer, to review the principles of these laws, and, as soon as we can,\r\nMAKE OUR GOVERNMENT WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE.\r\n\r\nNo one can question, Mr. President, that these paragraphs, from the last\r\nofficial publication of the President, show that, _in his opinion, the\r\ntariff, as a system designed for protection, is not only impolitic, but\r\nunconstitutional also_. They are quite incapable of any other version or\r\ninterpretation. They defy all explanation, and all glosses.\r\n\r\nSir, however we may differ from the principles or the policy of the\r\nadministration, it would, nevertheless, somewhat satisfy our pride of\r\ncountry, if we could ascribe to it the character of consistency. It\r\nwould be grateful if we could contemplate the President of the United\r\nStates as an identical idea. But even this secondary pleasure is denied\r\nto us. In looking to the published records of executive opinions,\r\nsentiments favorable to protection and sentiments against protection\r\neither come confusedly before us, at the same moment, or else follow\r\neach other in rapid succession, like the shadows of a phantasmagoria.\r\n\r\nHaving read an extract from the veto message, containing the statement\r\nof _present opinions_, allow me to read another extract from the annual\r\nmessage of 1830. It will be perceived, that in that message both the\r\nclear constitutionality of the tariff laws, and their indispensable\r\npolicy, are maintained in the fullest and strongest manner. The argument\r\non the constitutional point is stated with more than common ability; and\r\nthe policy of the laws is affirmed in terms importing the deepest and\r\nmost settled conviction. We hear in this message nothing of improvident\r\nlegislation; nothing of the abandonment of the legitimate objects of\r\ngovernment; nothing of the necessity of pausing in our career and\r\nreviewing our principles; nothing of the necessity of changing our\r\ngovernment, _till it shall be made what it ought to be_. But let the\r\nmessage speak for itself.\r\n\r\n  \"The power to impose duties on imports originally belonged to the\r\n  several States. The right to adjust those duties with a view to the\r\n  encouragement of domestic branches of industry is so completely\r\n  incidental to that power, that it is difficult to suppose the\r\n  existence of the one without the other. The States have delegated\r\n  their whole authority over imports to the general government,\r\n  without limitation or restriction, saving the very inconsiderable\r\n  reservation relating to their inspection laws. This authority having\r\n  thus entirely passed from the States, the right to exercise it for\r\n  the purpose of protection does not exist in them; and consequently,\r\n  if it be not possessed by the general government, it must be\r\n  extinct. Our political system would thus present the anomaly of a\r\n  people stripped of the right to foster their own industry, and to\r\n  counteract the most selfish and destructive policy which might be\r\n  adopted by foreign nations. This surely cannot be the case; this\r\n  indispensable power, thus surrendered by the States, must be within\r\n  the scope of the authority on the subject expressly delegated to\r\n  Congress.\r\n\r\n  \"In this conclusion I am confirmed, as well by the opinions of\r\n  Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, who have each\r\n  repeatedly recommended the exercise of this right under the\r\n  Constitution, as by the uniform practice of Congress, the continued\r\n  acquiescence of the States, and the general understanding of the\r\n  people.\r\n\r\n  \"I am well aware that this is a subject of so much delicacy, on\r\n  account of the extended interests it involves, as to require that it\r\n  should be touched with the utmost caution; and that, while an\r\n  abandonment of the policy in which it originated, a policy coeval\r\n  with our government, pursued through successive administrations, is\r\n  neither to be expected nor desired, the people have a right to\r\n  demand, and have demanded, that it be so modified as to correct\r\n  abuses and obviate injustice.\"\r\n\r\nMr. President, no one needs to point out inconsistencies plain and\r\nstriking as these. The message of 1830 is a well-written paper; it\r\nproceeded, probably, from the cabinet proper. Whence the veto message of\r\n1832 proceeded, I know not; perhaps from the cabinet improper.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, there is an important record of an earlier date than 1830. If,\r\nas the President avers, we have been guilty of improvident legislation,\r\nwhat act of Congress is the most striking instance of that improvidence?\r\nCertainly it is the act of 1824. The principle of protection, repeatedly\r\nrecognized before that time, was, by that act, carried to a new and\r\ngreat extent; so new and so great, that the act was considered as the\r\nfoundation of the system. That law it was which conferred on the\r\ndistinguished citizen, whose nomination for President this meeting has\r\nreceived with so much enthusiasm, (Mr. Clay,) the appellation of the\r\n\"Author of the American System.\" Accordingly, the act of 1824 has been\r\nthe particular object of attack, in all the warfare waged against the\r\nprotective policy. If Congress ever abandoned legitimate objects of\r\nlegislation in favor of protection, it did so by that law. If any laws\r\nnow on the statute-book, or which ever were there, show, by their\r\ncharacter as laws of protection, that our government is not what it\r\nought to be, and that it ought to be altered, and, in the language of\r\nthe veto message, _made_ what it ought to be, the law of 1824 is the\r\nvery law which, more than any and more than all others, makes good that\r\nassertion. And yet, Sir, the President of the United States, then a\r\nSenator in Congress, voted for that law! And, though I have not recurred\r\nto the journal, my recollection is, that, as to some of its provisions,\r\nhis support was essential to their success. It will be found, I think,\r\nthat some of its enactments, and those now most loudly complained of,\r\nwould have failed, but for his own personal support of them by his own\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nAfter all this, it might have been hoped that there would be, in 1832,\r\nsome tolerance of opinion toward those who cannot think that\r\nimprovidence, abandonment of all the legitimate objects of legislation,\r\na desire to gratify the rich, who have besought Congress to make them\r\nstill richer, and the adoption of principles unequal, oppressive, and\r\nodious, are the true characteristics to be ascribed to the system of\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, it is but a small part of my object to show inconsistencies\r\nin executive opinions. My main purpose is different, and tends to\r\nmore practical ends. It is, to call the attention of the meeting, and\r\nof the people, to the principles avowed in the late message as being\r\nthe President's _present opinions_, and proofs of _his present\r\npurposes_, and to the consequences, if they shall be maintained by\r\nthe country. These principles are there expressed in language which\r\nneeds no commentary. They go, with a point-blank aim, against the\r\nfundamental stone of the protective system; that is to say, against\r\nthe constitutional power of Congress to establish and maintain that\r\nsystem, in whole or in part. The question, therefore, of the tariff,\r\nthe question of every tariff, the question between maintaining our\r\nagricultural and manufacturing interests where they now are, and\r\nbreaking up the entire system, and erasing every vestige of it from\r\nthe statute book, is a question materially to be affected by the pending\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe President has exercised his NEGATIVE power on the law for continuing\r\nthe bank charter. Here, too, he denies both the constitutionality and\r\nthe policy of an existing law of the land. It is true that the law, or a\r\nsimilar one, has been in operation nearly forty years. Previous\r\nPresidents and previous Congresses have, all along, sanctioned and\r\nupheld it. The highest courts, and indeed all the courts, have\r\npronounced it constitutional. A majority of the people, greater than\r\nexists on almost any other question, agrees with all the Presidents, all\r\nthe Congresses, and all the courts of law. Yet, against all this weight\r\nof authority, the President puts forth his own individual opinion, and\r\nhas negatived the bill for continuing the law. Which of the members of\r\nhis administration, or whether any one of them, concur in his\r\nsentiments, we know not. Some of them, we know, have recently advanced\r\nprecisely the opposite opinions, and in the strongest manner recommended\r\nto Congress the continuation of the bank charter. Having himself\r\nurgently and repeatedly called the attention of Congress to the\r\nsubject, and his Secretary of the Treasury--who, and all the other\r\nsecretaries, as the President's friends say, are but so many pens in his\r\nhand--having, in his communication to Congress, at this very session,\r\ninsisted both on the constitutionality and necessity of the bank, the\r\nPresident nevertheless saw fit to negative the bill, passed, as it had\r\nbeen, by strong majorities in both Houses, and passed, without doubt or\r\nquestion, in compliance with the wishes of a vast majority of the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nThe question respecting the constitutional power of Congress to\r\nestablish a bank, I shall not here discuss. On that, as well as on the\r\ngeneral expediency of renewing the charter, my opinions have been\r\nelsewhere expressed. They are before the public, and the experience of\r\nevery day confirms me in their truth. All that has been said of the\r\nembarrassment and distress which will be felt from discontinuing the\r\nbank falls far short of an adequate representation. What was prophecy\r\nonly two months ago is already history.\r\n\r\nIn this part of the country, indeed, we experience this distress and\r\nembarrassment in a mitigated degree. The loans of the bank are not so\r\nhighly important, or at least not so absolutely necessary, to the\r\npresent operations of our commerce; yet we ourselves have a deep\r\ninterest in the subject, as it is connected with the general currency of\r\nthe country, and with the cheapness and facility of exchange.\r\n\r\nThe country, generally speaking, was well satisfied with the bank. Why\r\nnot let it alone? No evil had been felt from it in thirty-six years. Why\r\nconjure up a troop of fancied mischiefs, as a pretence to put it down?\r\nThe message struggles to excite prejudices, from the circumstance that\r\nforeigners are stockholders; and on this ground it raises a loud cry\r\nagainst a moneyed aristocracy. Can any thing, Sir, be conceived more\r\ninconsistent than this? any thing more remote from sound policy and good\r\nstatesmanship? In the United States the rate of interest is high,\r\ncompared with the rates abroad. In Holland and England, the actual value\r\nof money is no more than three, or perhaps three and a half, per cent.\r\nIn our Atlantic States, it is as high as five or six, taking the whole\r\nlength of the seaboard; in the Northwestern States, it is eight or ten,\r\nand in the Southwestern ten or twelve. If the introduction, then, of\r\nforeign capital be discountenanced and discouraged, the American\r\nmoneylender may fix his own rate anywhere from five to twelve per cent.\r\nper annum. On the other hand, if the introduction of foreign capital be\r\ncountenanced and encouraged, its effects to keep down the rate of\r\ninterest, and to bring the value of money in the United States so much\r\nthe nearer to its value in older and richer countries. Every dollar\r\nbrought from abroad, and put into the mass of active capital at home, by\r\nso much diminishes the rate of interest; and by so much, therefore,\r\nbenefits all the active and trading classes of society, at the expense\r\nof the American capitalist. Yet the President's invention, for such it\r\ndeserves to be called, that which is to secure us against the\r\npossibility of being oppressed by a moneyed aristocracy, is to shut the\r\ndoor and bar it safely against all introduction of foreign capital!\r\n\r\nMr. President, what is it that has made England a sort of general banker\r\nfor the civilized world? Why is it that capital from all quarters of the\r\nglobe accumulates at the centre of her empire, and is thence again\r\ndistributed? Doubtless, Sir, it is because she invites it, and solicits\r\nit. She sees the advantage of this; and no British minister ever yet did\r\na thing so rash, so inconsiderate, so startling, as to exhibit a\r\ngroundless feeling of dissatisfaction at the introduction or employment\r\nof foreign capital.\r\n\r\nSir, of all the classes of society, the larger stockholders of the bank\r\nare among those least likely to suffer from its discontinuance. There\r\nare, indeed, on the list of stockholders many charitable institutions,\r\nmany widows and orphans, holding small amounts. To these, and other\r\nproprietors of a like character, the breaking up of the bank will, no\r\ndoubt, be seriously inconvenient. But the capitalist, he who has\r\ninvested money in the bank merely for the sake of the security and the\r\ninterest, has nothing to fear. The refusal to renew the charter will, it\r\nis true, diminish the value of the stock; but, then, the same refusal\r\nwill create a scarcity of money; and this will reduce the price of all\r\nother stocks; so that the stockholders in the bank, receiving, on its\r\ndissolution, their portion respectively of its capital, will have\r\nopportunities of new and advantageous investment.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, Sir, the great loss, the sore embarrassment, the severe\r\ndistress, arising from this VETO, will fall on the public, and\r\nespecially on the more active and industrious portion of the public. It\r\nwill inevitably create a scarcity of money; in the Western States, it\r\nwill most materially depress the value of property; it will greatly\r\nenhance, everywhere, the price of domestic exchange; it threatens,\r\neverywhere, fluctuations of the currency; and it drives all our\r\nwell-settled and safe operations of revenue and finance out of their\r\naccustomed channels. All this is to be suffered on the pretended ground\r\nof a constitutional scruple, which no respect for the opinion of others,\r\nno deference to legislative precedent, no decent regard to judicial\r\ndecision, no homage to public opinion, expressed and maintained for\r\nforty years, have power to overcome. An idle apprehension of danger is\r\nset up against the experience of almost half a century; loose and flimsy\r\ntheories are asserted against facts of general notoriety; and arguments\r\nare urged against continuing the charter, so superficial and frivolous,\r\nand yet so evidently addressed to those of the community who have never\r\nhad occasion to be conversant with subjects of this sort, that an\r\nintelligent reader, who wishes to avoid imputing obliquity of motive, is\r\nobliged to content himself with ascribing to the source of the message,\r\nwhatever and wherever that source may have been, no very distinguished\r\nshare of the endowments of intellect.\r\n\r\nMr. President, as early as December, 1829, the President called the\r\nattention of Congress to the subject of the bank, in the most earnest\r\nmanner. Look to his annual message of that date. You will find that he\r\nthen felt constrained, by an irresistible sense of duty to the various\r\ninterests concerned, not to delay beyond that moment his urgent\r\ninvitation to Congress to take up the subject. He brought forward the\r\nsame topic again, in all his subsequent annual messages; yet when\r\nCongress _did_ act upon it, and, on the fourth of July, EIGHTEEN HUNDRED\r\nAND THIRTY-TWO, _did_ send him a bill, he returned it with his\r\nobjections; and among these objections, he not only complained _that the\r\nexecutive was not consulted on the propriety of present action_, but\r\naffirmed also, in so many words, _that present action was deemed\r\npremature by the executive department_.\r\n\r\nLet me ask, Mr. President, if it be possible that the same President,\r\nthe same chief magistrate, the same mind, could have composed these two\r\nmessages? Certainly they much more resemble the production of _two_\r\nminds, holding, on this point, precisely opposite opinions. The message\r\nof December, 1829, asserts that the time had _then_ come for Congress to\r\nconsider the bank subject; the message of 1832 declares, that, even\r\nthen, the action of Congress on the same subject was _premature_; and\r\nboth these messages were sent to Congress by the President of the United\r\nStates. Sir, I leave these two messages to be compared and considered by\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I will here take notice of but one other suggestion of\r\nthe President, relative to the time and manner of passing the late bill.\r\nA decent respect for the legislature of the country has hitherto been\r\nobserved by all who have had occasion to hold official intercourse with\r\nit, and especially by all other branches of the government. The purity\r\nof the motives of Congress, in regard to any measure, has never been\r\nassailed from any respectable quarter. But in the veto message there is\r\none expression, which, as it seems to me, no American can read without\r\nsome feeling. There is an expression, evidently not casual or\r\naccidental, but inserted with design and composed with care, which does\r\ncarry a direct imputation of the possibility of the effect of _private\r\ninterest_ and _private influence_ on the deliberations of the two Houses\r\nof Congress. I quote the passage, and shall leave it without a single\r\nremark:--\"Whatever interest or influence, whether public or private, has\r\ngiven birth to this act, it cannot be found either in the wishes or\r\nnecessities of the executive department, by which present action is\r\ndeemed premature.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the great interests of the country, Mr. President, there is one\r\nwhich appears to me not to have attracted from the people of this\r\nCommonwealth a degree of attention altogether equal to its magnitude. I\r\nmean the public lands.\r\n\r\nIf we run our eye over the map of the country, and view the regions,\r\nalmost boundless, which now constitute the public domain, and over which\r\nan active population is rapidly spreading itself, and if we recollect\r\nthe amount of annual revenue derived from this source, we shall hardly\r\nfail to be convinced that few branches of national interest are of more\r\nextensive and lasting importance. So large a territory, belonging to the\r\npublic, forms a subject of national concern of a very delicate nature,\r\nespecially in popular governments. We know, in the history of other\r\ncountries, with what views and designs the public lands have been\r\ngranted. Either in the form of gifts and largesses, or in that of\r\nreduction of prices to amounts merely nominal, or as compensation for\r\nservices, real or imagined, the public domain, in other countries and\r\nother times, has not only been diverted from its just use and\r\ndestination, but has been the occasion, also, of introducing into the\r\nstate and into the public counsels no small portion both of distraction\r\nand corruption.\r\n\r\nHappily, our own system of administering this great interest has\r\nhitherto been both safe and successful. Nothing under the government has\r\nbeen better devised than our land system; and nothing, thus far, more\r\nbeneficially conducted. But the time seems to have arrived, in the\r\nprogress of our growth and prosperity, when it has become necessary to\r\nreflect, not on any new mode of sale, for that can hardly be improved,\r\nbut on some disposition of the proceeds such as shall be just and equal\r\nto the whole country, and shall insure also a constant and vigilant\r\nattention to this important subject from the people of all the States.\r\nIt is not to be denied or disguised, that sentiments have recently\r\nsprung up, in some places, of a very extraordinary character, respecting\r\nthe ownership, the just proprietary interest, in these lands. The lands\r\nare well known to have been obtained by the United States, either by\r\ngrants from individual States, or by treaties with foreign powers. In\r\nboth cases, and in all cases, the grants and cessions were to the United\r\nStates, for the interest of the whole Union; and the grants from\r\nindividual States contain express limitations and conditions, binding up\r\nthe whole property to the common use of all the States for ever. Yet, of\r\nlate years, an idea has been suggested, indeed seriously advanced, _that\r\nthese lands, of right, belong to the States respectively in which they\r\nhappen to lie_. This doctrine, Sir, which, I perceive, strikes this\r\nassembly as being somewhat extravagant, is founded on an argument\r\nderived, as is supposed, from the nature of State sovereignty. It has\r\nbeen openly espoused, by candidates for office, in some of the new\r\nStates, and, indeed, has been announced in the Senate of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nTo the credit of the country, it should be stated, that, up to the\r\npresent moment, these notions have not spread widely; and they will be\r\nrepudiated, undoubtedly, by the power of general opinion, so soon as\r\nthat opinion shall be awakened and expressed. But there is another\r\ntendency more likely, perhaps, to run to injurious excess; and that is,\r\na constant effort to reduce the price of land to sums almost nominal, on\r\nthe ground of facilitating settlement. The sound policy of the\r\ngovernment has been, uniformly, to keep the prices of the public lands\r\nlow; so low that every actual settler might easily obtain a farm; but\r\nyet not so low as to tempt individual capitalists to buy up large\r\nquantities to hold for speculation. The object has been to meet, at all\r\ntimes, the whole actual demand, at a cheap rate; and this object has\r\nbeen attained. It is obviously of the greatest importance to keep the\r\nprices of the public lands from all influences, except the single one of\r\nthe desire of supplying the whole actual demand at a cheap rate. The\r\npresent minimum price is one dollar and a quarter per acre; and millions\r\nof acres of land, much of it of an excellent quality, are now in the\r\nmarket at this rate. Yet every year there are propositions to reduce the\r\nprice, and propositions to graduate the price; that is to say, to\r\nprovide that all lands having been offered for sale for a certain length\r\nof time at the established rate, if not then sold, shall be offered at a\r\nless rate; and again reduced, if not sold, to one still less. I have\r\nmyself thought, that, in some of the oldest districts, some mode might\r\nusefully be adopted of disposing of the remainder of the unsold lands,\r\nand closing the offices; but a universal system of graduation, lowering\r\nprices at short intervals, and by large degrees, could have no other\r\neffect than a general depression of price in regard to the whole mass,\r\nand would evidently be great mismanagement of the public property. This\r\nconvention, Sir, will think it singular enough, that a reduction of\r\nprices of the public lands should have been demanded on the ground _that\r\nother impositions for revenue, such as the duty on tea and coffee, have\r\nbeen removed_; thus considering and treating the sums received for lands\r\nsold as a _tax_, a _burden_, an _imposition_, and a great _drain_ on the\r\nmeans and the industry of the new States. A man goes from New England to\r\none of the Western States, buys a hundred acres of the best land in the\r\nworld for one hundred and twenty-five dollars, pays his money, and\r\nreceives an indisputable title; and immediately some one stands up in\r\nCongress to call this operation the laying of a _tax_, the imposition of\r\na _burden_; and the whole of these purchases and payments, taken\r\ntogether, are represented as an intolerable _drain_ on the money and the\r\nindustry of the new States. I know not, Sir, which deserves to pass for\r\nthe original, and which for the copy; but this reasoning is not unlike\r\nthat which maintains that the trading community of the West will be\r\nexhausted and ruined by the privilege of borrowing money of the Bank of\r\nthe United States at six per cent interest; this interest being, as is\r\nsaid in the veto message, a burden upon their industry, and a drain of\r\ntheir currency, which no country can bear without inconvenience and\r\ndistress!\r\n\r\nIt was in a forced connection with the reduction of duties of impost,\r\nthat the subject of the public lands was referred to the Committee of\r\nManufactures in the Senate, at the late session of Congress. This was a\r\nlegislative movement, calculated to throw on Mr. Clay, who was acting a\r\nleading part on the subject of the tariff and the reduction of duties, a\r\nnew and delicate responsibility. From this responsibility, however, Mr.\r\nClay did not shrink. He took up the subject, and his report upon it, and\r\nhis speech delivered afterwards in defence of the report, are, in my\r\nopinion, among the very ablest of the efforts which have distinguished\r\nhis long public life. I desire to commend their perusal to every citizen\r\nof Massachusetts. They will show him the deep interest of all the\r\nStates, his own among the rest, in the security, and proper management,\r\nand disposal, of the public domain. Founded on the report of the\r\ncommittee, Mr. Clay introduced a bill, providing for the distribution\r\namong all the States, according to population, of the proceeds of the\r\nsales of the public lands for five years, first making a deduction of a\r\nconsiderable percentage in favor of the new States; the sums thus\r\nreceived by the States to be disposed of by them in favor of education,\r\ninternal improvement, or colonization, as each State might choose for\r\nitself. This bill passed the Senate. It was vigorously opposed in the\r\nHouse of Representatives by the main body of the friends of the\r\nadministration, and finally lost by a small majority. By the provisions\r\nof the bill, Massachusetts would have received, as her dividend, at the\r\npresent average rate of sales, one hundred and thirty-seven thousand\r\ndollars a year.\r\n\r\nI am free to confess, Sir, that I had hoped to see some unobjectionable\r\nway of disposing of this subject, with the observance of justice towards\r\nall the States, by the government of the United States itself, without a\r\ndistribution through the intervention of the State governments. Such a\r\nway, however, I have not discovered. I therefore voted for the bill of\r\nthe last session.\r\n\r\nMr. President, let me remind the meeting of the great extent of this\r\npublic property.\r\n\r\nOnly twenty millions of acres have been as yet sold, from the\r\ncommencement of the government. One hundred and twenty millions, or\r\nabout that quantity, are now cleared from the Indian title, surveyed\r\ninto townships, ranges, and sections, and ready in the market for sale.\r\nI think, Sir, the whole surface of Massachusetts embraces about six\r\nmillions of acres; so that the United States have a body of land, now\r\nsurveyed and in market, equal to twenty States, each of the size of\r\nMassachusetts. But this is but a very small portion of the whole domain,\r\nmuch the greater part being yet unsurveyed, and much, too, subject to\r\nthe original Indian title. The present income to the treasury from the\r\nsales of land is estimated at three millions of dollars a year. The\r\nmeeting will thus see, Sir, how important a subject this is, and how\r\nhighly it becomes the country to guard this vast property against\r\nperversion and bad management.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. President, among the bills which failed, at the last session, for\r\nwant of the President's approval, was one in which this State had a\r\ngreat pecuniary interest. It was the bill for the payment of interest\r\nto the States on the funds advanced by them during the war, the\r\nprincipal of which had been paid, or assumed, by the government of the\r\nUnited States. Some sessions ago, a bill was introduced into the Senate\r\nby my worthy colleague, and passed into a law, for paying a large\r\npart of the principal sum advanced by Massachusetts for militia\r\nexpenses for defence of the country. This has been paid. The residue\r\nof the claim is in the proper course of examination; and such parts\r\nof it as ought to be allowed will doubtless be paid hereafter, _vetos_\r\nbeing out of the way, be it always understood. In the late bill, it\r\nwas proposed that _interest_ should be paid to the States on these\r\nadvances, in cases where it had not been already paid. It passed both\r\nHouses. I recollect no opposition to it in the Senate nor do I\r\nremember to have heard of any considerable objection in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. The argument for it lay in its own obvious justice; a\r\njustice too apparent, as it seems to me, to be denied by any one. I\r\nleft Congress, Sir, a day or two before its adjournment, and,\r\nmeeting some friends in this village on my way home, we exchanged\r\ncongratulations on this additional act of justice thus rendered to\r\nMassachusetts, as well as other States. But I had hardly reached\r\nFramingham, before I learned that our congratulations were premature.\r\nThe President's signature had been refused, and the bill was not a\r\nlaw! The only reason which I have ever heard for this refusal is,\r\nthat Congress had not been in the practice of allowing interest on\r\nclaims. This is not true, as a universal rule; but if it were, might\r\nnot Congress be trusted with the maintenance of its own rules? Might\r\nit not make exceptions to them for good cause? There is no doubt\r\nthat, in regard to old and long-neglected claims, it has been customary\r\nnot to allow interest; but the Massachusetts claim was not of this\r\ncharacter, nor were the claims of other States. None of them had\r\nremained unpaid for want of presentment. The executive and legislature\r\nof this Commonwealth have never omitted to press her demand for justice,\r\nand her delegates in Congress have endeavored to discharge their duty\r\nby supporting that demand. It has been already decided, in repeated\r\ninstances, as well in regard to States as to individuals, that when\r\nmoney has been actually _borrowed_, for objects for which the\r\ngeneral government ought to provide, interest paid on such _borrowed\r\nmoney_ shall be refunded by the United States. Now, Sir, would it not\r\nbe a distinction without a difference to allow interest in such a\r\ncase, and yet refuse it in another, in which the State had not borrowed\r\nthe money, and paid interest for it, but had raised it by taxation,\r\nor, as I believe was the case with Massachusetts, by the sale of\r\nvaluable stocks, _bearing interest_? Is it not apparent, that, in her\r\ncase, as clearly as in that of a _borrowing_ State, she has actually\r\n_lost_ the interest? Can any man maintain that between these two cases\r\nthere is any sound distinction, in law, in equity, or in morals? The\r\nrefusal to sign this bill has deprived Massachusetts and Maine of a\r\nvery large sum of money, justly due to them. It is now fifteen or\r\nsixteen years since the money was advanced; and it was advanced for the\r\nmost necessary and praiseworthy public purposes. The interest on the\r\nsum already refunded, and on that which may reasonably be expected to\r\nbe hereafter refunded, is not less than _five hundred thousand\r\ndollars_. But for the President's refusal, in this unusual mode, to\r\ngive his approbation to a bill which had passed Congress almost\r\nunanimously, these two States would already have been in the receipt of\r\na very considerable portion of this money, and the residue, to be\r\nreceived in due season, would have been made sure to them.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I do not desire to raise mere pecuniary interests to an\r\nundue importance in political matters. I admit there are principles and\r\nobjects of paramount obligation and importance. I would not oppose the\r\nPresident merely because he has refused to the State what I thought her\r\nentitled to, in a matter of money, provided he had made known his\r\nreasons, and they had appeared to be such as might fairly influence an\r\nintelligent and honest mind. But in a matter of such great and direct\r\nimportance to a State, where the justice of the case is so plain, that\r\nmen agree in it who agree in hardly any thing else, where her claim\r\nhas passed Congress without considerable opposition in either House,\r\na refusal to approve the bill without giving the slightest reason,\r\nthe taking advantage of the rising of Congress to give it a silent\r\ngo-by, _is_ an act that may well awaken the attention of the people\r\nin the States concerned. It _is_ an act requiring close examination. It\r\n_is_ an act which calls loudly for justification by its author. And\r\nnow, Sir, I will close what I have to say on this particular subject by\r\nstating, that, on the 22d of March, 1832, the President did actually\r\napprove and sign a bill, in favor of South Carolina, by which it was\r\nenacted that her claim _for interest upon money actually expended_ by\r\nher for military stores during the late war should be settled and\r\npaid; _the money so expended having been drawn by the State from a\r\nfund upon which she was receiving interest_. This was precisely the\r\ncase of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. President, I now approach an inquiry of a far deeper and more\r\naffecting interest. Are the principles and measures of the\r\nadministration dangerous to the Constitution and to the union of the\r\nStates? Sir, I believe them to be so, and I shall state the grounds of\r\nthat belief.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, any administration is dangerous to the Constitution\r\nand to the union of the States, which denies the essential powers of the\r\nConstitution, and thus strips it of the capacity to do the good intended\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nThe principles embraced by the administration, and expressed in the veto\r\nmessage, are evidently hostile to the whole system of protection by\r\nduties of impost, _on constitutional grounds_. Here, then, is _one_\r\ngreat power struck at once out of the Constitution, and one great end of\r\nits adoption defeated. And while this power is thus struck out of the\r\nConstitution, it is clear that it exists nowhere else, since the\r\nConstitution expressly takes it away from all the States.\r\n\r\nThe veto message denies the constitutional power of creating or\r\ncontinuing such an institution as our whole experience has approved, for\r\nmaintaining a sound, uniform, national currency, and for the safe\r\ncollection of revenue. Here is _another_ power, long used, and now\r\nlopped off. And _this_ power, too, thus lopped off from the\r\nConstitution, is evidently not within the power of any of the individual\r\nStates. No State can maintain a national currency; no State institution\r\ncan render to the revenue the services performed by a national\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nThe principles of the administration are hostile to internal\r\nimprovements. Here is another power, heretofore exercised in many\r\ninstances, now denied. The administration denies the power, except with\r\nqualifications which cast an air of ridicule over the whole subject;\r\nbeing founded on such distinctions as between salt water and fresh\r\nwater, places above custom-houses and places below, and others equally\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, in all these respects, as well as in others, I think the\r\nprinciples of the administration are at war with the true principles of\r\nthe Constitution; and that, by the zeal and industry which it exerts to\r\nsupport its own principles, it does daily weaken the Constitution, and\r\ndoes put in doubt its long continuance. The inroad of to-day opens the\r\nway for an easier inroad to-morrow. When any one essential part is rent\r\naway, or, what is nearer the truth, when many essential parts are rent\r\naway, who is there to tell us _how long any other part is to remain_?\r\n\r\nSir, our condition is singularly paradoxical. We have an administration\r\nopposed to the Constitution; we have an opposition which is the main\r\nsupport of the government and the laws. We have an administration\r\ndenying to the very government which it administers powers that have\r\nbeen exercised for forty years; it denies the protective power, the bank\r\npower, and the power of internal improvement. The great and leading\r\nmeasures of the national legislature are all resisted by it. These,\r\nstrange as it may seem, depend on the _opposition_ for support. We have,\r\nin truth, an opposition, without which it would be difficult for the\r\ngovernment to get along at all. I appeal to every member of Congress\r\npresent, (and I am happy to see many here,) to say what would now become\r\nof the government, if all the members of the opposition were withdrawn\r\nfrom Congress. For myself, I declare my own conviction that its\r\ncontinuance would probably be very short. Take away the opposition from\r\nCongress, and let us see what would probably be done, the first session.\r\nThe TARIFF would be entirely _repealed_. Every enactment having\r\nprotection by duties as its main object would be struck from the\r\nstatute-book. This would be the first thing done. Every work of internal\r\nimprovement would be stopped. This would follow, as matter of course.\r\nThe bank would go down, and a _treasury money agency_ would take its\r\nplace. The Judiciary Act of 1789 would be repealed, so that the Supreme\r\nCourt should exercise no power of revision over State decisions. And who\r\nwould resist the doctrines of NULLIFICATION? Look, Sir, to the votes of\r\nCongress for the last three years, and you will see that each of these\r\nthings would, in all human probability, take place at the next session,\r\nif the opposition were to be withdrawn. The Constitution is threatened,\r\ntherefore, imminently threatened, by the very fact that those intrusted\r\nwith its administration are hostile to its essential powers.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, in my opinion, a yet greater danger threatens the Constitution\r\nand the government; and that is from the attempt _to extend the power of\r\nthe executive at the expense of all the other branches of the\r\ngovernment, and of the people themselves_. Whatever accustomed power is\r\ndenied to the Constitution, whatever accustomed power is denied to\r\nCongress, or to the judiciary, _none is denied to the executive_. Here\r\nthere is no retrenchment; here no apprehension is felt for the liberties\r\nof the people; here it is not thought necessary to erect barriers\r\nagainst corruption.\r\n\r\nI begin, Sir, with the subject of removals from office for opinion's\r\nsake, one of the most signal instances, as I think, of the attempt to\r\nextend executive power. This has been a leading measure, a cardinal\r\npoint, in the course of the administration. It has proceeded, from the\r\nfirst, on a settled proscription for political opinions; and this system\r\nit has carried into operation to the full extent of its ability. The\r\nPresident has not only filled all vacancies with his own friends,\r\ngenerally those most distinguished as personal partisans, but he has\r\nturned out political opponents, and thus created vacancies, in order\r\nthat he might fill them with his own friends. I think the number of\r\nremovals and appointments is said to be _two thousand_. While the\r\nadministration and its friends have been attempting to circumscribe and\r\nto decry the powers belonging to other branches, it has thus seized into\r\nits own hands a patronage most pernicious and corrupting, an authority\r\nover men's means of living most tyrannical and odious, and a power to\r\npunish free men for political opinions altogether intolerable.\r\n\r\nYou will remember, Sir, that the Constitution says not one word about\r\nthe President's power of removal from office. It is a power raised\r\nentirely by construction. It is a constructive power, introduced at\r\nfirst to meet cases of extreme public necessity. It has now become\r\ncoextensive with the executive will, calling for no necessity, requiring\r\nno exigency for its exercise; to be employed at all times, without\r\ncontrol, without question, without responsibility. When the question of\r\nthe President's power of removal was debated in the first Congress,\r\nthose who argued for it limited it to _extreme cases_. Cases, they said,\r\nmight arise, in which it would be _absolutely necessary_ to remove an\r\nofficer before the Senate could be assembled. An officer might become\r\ninsane; he might abscond; and from these and other supposable cases, it\r\nwas said, the public service might materially suffer if the President\r\ncould not remove the incumbent. And it was further said, that there was\r\nlittle or no danger of the abuse of the power for party or personal\r\nobjects. No President, it was thought, would ever commit such an outrage\r\non public opinion. Mr. Madison, who thought the power ought to exist,\r\nand to be exercised in cases of high necessity, declared, nevertheless,\r\nthat if a President should resort to the power when not required by any\r\npublic exigency, and merely for personal objects, _he would deserve to\r\nbe impeached_. By a very small majority,--I think, in the Senate, by the\r\ncasting vote of the Vice-President,--Congress decided in favor of the\r\nexistence of the power of removal, upon the grounds which I have\r\nmentioned; granting the power in a case of clear and absolute necessity,\r\nand denying its existence everywhere else.\r\n\r\nMr. President, we should recollect that this question was discussed, and\r\nthus decided, when Washington was in the executive chair. Men knew that\r\nin his hands the power would not be abused; nor did they conceive it\r\npossible that any of his successors could so far depart from his great\r\nand bright example, as, by abuse of the power, and by carrying that\r\nabuse to its utmost extent, to change the essential character of the\r\nexecutive from that of an impartial guardian and executor of the laws\r\ninto that of the chief dispenser of party rewards. Three or four\r\ninstances of removal occurred in the first twelve years of the\r\ngovernment. At the commencement of Mr. Jefferson's administration, he\r\nmade several others, not without producing much dissatisfaction; so much\r\nso, that he thought it expedient to give reasons to the people, in a\r\npublic paper, for even the limited extent to which he had exercised the\r\npower. He rested his justification on particular circumstances and\r\npeculiar grounds; which, whether substantial or not, showed, at least,\r\nthat he did not regard the power of removal as an ordinary power, still\r\nless as a mere arbitrary one, to be used as he pleased, for whatever\r\nends he pleased, and without responsibility. As far as I remember, Sir,\r\nafter the early part of Mr. Jefferson's administration, hardly an\r\ninstance occurred for near thirty years. If there were any instances,\r\nthey were few. But at the commencement of the present administration,\r\nthe precedent of these previous cases was seized on, and a _system_, a\r\nregular _plan of government_, a well-considered scheme for the\r\nmaintenance of party power by the patronage of office, and this\r\npatronage to be created by general removal, was adopted, and has been\r\ncarried into full operation. Indeed, before General Jackson's\r\ninauguration, the party put the system into practice. In the last\r\nsession of Mr. Adams's administration, the friends of General Jackson\r\nconstituted a majority in the Senate; and nominations, made by Mr. Adams\r\nto fill vacancies which had occurred in the ordinary way, were\r\npostponed, by this majority, beyond the 3d of March, _for the purpose,\r\nopenly avowed, of giving the nominations to General Jackson_. A\r\nnomination for a judge of the Supreme Court, and many others of less\r\nmagnitude, were thus disposed of.\r\n\r\nAnd what did we witness, Sir, when the administration actually\r\ncommenced, in the full exercise of its authority? One universal sweep,\r\none undistinguishing blow, levelled against all who were not of the\r\nsuccessful party. No worth, public or private, no service, civil or\r\nmilitary, was of power to resist the relentless greediness of\r\nproscription. Soldiers of the late war, soldiers of the Revolutionary\r\nwar, the very contemporaries of the independence of the country, all\r\nlost their situations. No office was too high, and none too low; for\r\n_office_ was the spoil, and \"_all the spoils_,\" it is said, \"belong to\r\nthe _victors_!\" If a man holding an office necessary for his daily\r\nsupport had presented himself covered with the scars of wounds received\r\nin every battle, from Bunker Hill to Yorktown, these would not have\r\nprotected him against this reckless rapacity. Nay, Sir, if Warren\r\nhimself had been among the living, and had possessed any office under\r\ngovernment, high or low, he would not have been suffered to hold it a\r\nsingle hour, unless he could show that he had strictly complied with the\r\nparty statutes, and had put a well-marked party collar round his own\r\nneck. Look, Sir, to the case of the late venerable Major Melville. He\r\nwas a personification of the spirit of 1776, one of the earliest to\r\nventure in the cause of liberty. He was of the Tea Party; one of the\r\nvery first to expose himself to British power. And his whole life was\r\nconsonant with this, its beginning. Always ardent in the cause of\r\nliberty, always a zealous friend to his country, always acting with the\r\nparty which he supposed cherished the genuine republican spirit most\r\nfervently, always estimable and respectable in private life, he seemed\r\narmed against this miserable petty tyranny of party as far as man could\r\nbe. But he felt its blow, and he fell. He held an office in the\r\ncustom-house, and had held it for a long course of years; and he was\r\ndeprived of it, as if unworthy to serve the country which he loved, and\r\nfor whose liberties, in the vigor of his early manhood, he had thrust\r\nhimself into the very jaws of its enemies. There was no mistake in the\r\nmatter. His character, his standing, his Revolutionary services, were\r\nall well known; but they were known to no purpose; they weighed not one\r\nfeather against party pretensions. It cost no pains to remove him; it\r\ncost no compunction to wring his aged heart with this retribution from\r\nhis country for his services, his zeal, and his fidelity. Sir, you will\r\nbear witness,[98] that, when his successor was nominated to the Senate,\r\nand the Senate were informed who had been removed to make way for that\r\nnomination, its members were struck with horror. They had not conceived\r\nthe administration to be capable of such a thing; and yet, they said,\r\nWhat can _we_ do? The man is removed; _we_ cannot recall him; we can\r\nonly act upon the nomination before us. Sir, you and I thought\r\notherwise; and I rejoice that we did think otherwise. We thought it our\r\nduty to resist the nomination to fill a vacancy thus created. We thought\r\nit our duty to oppose this proscription, when, and where, and as, we\r\nconstitutionally could. We besought the Senate to go with us, and to\r\ntake a stand before the country on this great question. We invoked them\r\nto try the deliberate sense of the people; to trust themselves before\r\nthe tribunal of public opinion; to resist at first, to resist at last,\r\nto resist always, the introduction of this unsocial, this mischievous,\r\nthis dangerous, this belligerent principle into the practice of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nMr. President, as far as I know, there is no civilized country on earth,\r\nin which, on a change of rulers, there is such an _inquisition for\r\nspoil_ as we have witnessed in this free republic. The Inaugural Address\r\nof 1829 spoke of a _searching operation_ of government. The most\r\nsearching operation, Sir, of the present administration, has been its\r\nsearch for office and place. When, Sir, did any English minister, Whig\r\nor Tory, ever make such an inquest? When did he ever go down to\r\nlow-water-mark, to make an ousting of tide-waiters? When did he ever\r\ntake away the daily bread of weighers, and gaugers, and measurers? When\r\ndid he ever go into the villages, to disturb the little post-offices,\r\nthe mail contracts, and every thing else in the remotest degree\r\nconnected with government? Sir, a British minister who should do this,\r\nand should afterwards show his head in a British House of Commons, would\r\nbe received by a universal hiss.\r\n\r\nI have little to say of the selections made to fill vacancies thus\r\ncreated. It is true, however, and it is a natural consequence of the\r\nsystem which has been acted on, that, within the last three years, more\r\nnominations have been rejected on the ground of _unfitness_, than in all\r\nthe preceding forty years of the government. And these nominations, you\r\nknow, Sir, could not have been rejected but by votes of the President's\r\nown friends. The cases were too strong to be resisted. Even party\r\nattachment could not stand them. In some not a third of the Senate, in\r\nothers not ten votes, and in others not a single vote, could be\r\nobtained; and this for no particular reason known only to the Senate,\r\nbut on general grounds of the want of character and qualifications; on\r\ngrounds known to every body else, as well as to the Senate. All this,\r\nSir, is perfectly natural and consistent. The same party selfishness\r\nwhich drives good men out of office will push bad men in. Political\r\nproscription leads necessarily to the filling of offices with\r\nincompetent persons, and to a consequent mal-execution of official\r\nduties. And in my opinion, Sir, this principle of claiming a monopoly of\r\noffice by the right of conquest, unless the public shall effectually\r\nrebuke and restrain it, will entirely change the character of our\r\ngovernment. It elevates party above country; it forgets the common weal\r\nin the pursuit of personal emolument; it tends to form, it does form, we\r\nsee that it has formed, a political combination, united by no common\r\nprinciples or opinions among its members, either upon the powers of the\r\ngovernment, or the true policy of the country; but held together simply\r\nas an association, under the charm of a popular head, seeking to\r\nmaintain possession of the government by a _vigorous exercise of its\r\npatronage_; and for this purpose agitating, and alarming, and\r\ndistressing social life by the exercise of a tyrannical party\r\nproscription. Sir, if this course of things cannot be checked, good men\r\nwill grow tired of the exercise of political privileges. They will have\r\nnothing to do with popular elections. They will see that such elections\r\nare but a mere selfish contest for office; and they will abandon the\r\ngovernment to the scramble of the bold, the daring, and the desperate.\r\n\r\nIt seems, Mr. President, to be a peculiar and singular characteristic of\r\nthe present administration, that it came into power on a cry against\r\nabuses, _which did not exist_, and then, as soon as it was in, as if in\r\nmockery of the perception and intelligence of the people, _it created\r\nthose very abuses_, and carried them to a great length. Thus the chief\r\nmagistrate himself, before he came into the chair, in a formal public\r\npaper, denounced the practice of appointing members of Congress to\r\noffice. He said, that, if that practice continued, _corruption would\r\nbecome the order of the day_; and, as if to fasten and nail down his own\r\nconsistency to that point, he declared that it was _due to himself to\r\npractise what he recommended to others_. Yet, Sir, as soon as he was in\r\npower, these fastenings gave way, the nails all flew, and the promised\r\n_consistency_ remains a striking proof of the manner in which political\r\nassurances are sometimes fulfilled. He has already appointed more\r\nmembers of Congress to office than any of his predecessors, in the\r\nlongest period of administration. Before his time, there was no reason\r\nto complain of these appointments. They had not been numerous under any\r\nadministration. Under this, they have been numerous, and some of them\r\nsuch as may well justify complaint.\r\n\r\nAnother striking instance of the exhibition of the same characteristics\r\nmay be found in the sentiments of the Inaugural Address, and in the\r\nsubsequent practice, on the subject of _interfering with the freedom of\r\nelections_. The Inaugural Address declares, that it is necessary to\r\nreform abuses which have _brought the patronage of the government into\r\nconflict with the freedom of elections_. And what has been the\r\nsubsequent practice? Look to the newspapers; look to the published\r\nletters of officers of the government, advising, exhorting, soliciting,\r\nfriends and partisans to greater exertions in the cause of the party;\r\nsee all done, everywhere, which patronage and power can do, to affect,\r\nnot only elections in the general government, but also in every State\r\ngovernment, and then say, how well _this_ promise of reforming abuses\r\nhas been kept. At what former period, under what former administration,\r\ndid public officers of the United Stales thus interfere in elections?\r\nCertainly, Sir, never. In this respect, then, as well as in others, that\r\nwhich was not true as a charge against previous administrations would\r\nhave been true, if it had assumed the form of a prophecy respecting the\r\nacts of the present.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut there is another attempt to grasp and to wield a power over public\r\nopinion, of a still more daring character, and far more dangerous\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nIn all popular governments, a FREE PRESS is the most important of all\r\nagents and instruments. It not only expresses public opinion, but, to a\r\nvery great degree, it contributes to form that opinion. It is an engine\r\nfor good or for evil, as it may be directed; but an engine of which\r\nnothing can resist the force. The conductors of the press, in popular\r\ngovernments, occupy a place, in the social and political system, of the\r\nvery highest consequence. They wear the character of public instructors.\r\nTheir daily labors bear directly on the intelligence, the morals, the\r\ntaste, and the public spirit of the country. Not only are they\r\njournalists, recording political occurrences, but they discuss\r\nprinciples, they comment on measures, they canvass characters; they hold\r\na power over the reputation, the feelings, the happiness, of\r\nindividuals. The public ear is always open to their addresses, the\r\npublic sympathy easily made responsive to their sentiments. It is\r\nindeed, Sir, a distinction of high honor, that theirs is the only\r\nprofession expressly protected and guarded by constitutional enactments.\r\nTheir employment soars so high, in its general consequences it is so\r\nintimately connected with the public happiness, that its security is\r\nprovided for by the fundamental law. While it acts in a manner worthy of\r\nthis distinction, the press is a fountain of light, and a source of\r\ngladdening warmth. It instructs the public mind, and animates the spirit\r\nof patriotism. Its loud voice suppresses every thing which would raise\r\nitself against the public liberty; and its blasting rebuke causes\r\nincipient despotism to perish in the bud.\r\n\r\nBut remember, Sir, that these are the attributes of a FREE press only.\r\nAnd is a press that is purchased or pensioned more free than a press\r\nthat is fettered? Can the people look for truths to partial sources,\r\nwhether rendered partial through fear or through favor? Why shall not a\r\nmanacled press be trusted with the maintenance and defence of popular\r\nrights? Because it is supposed to be under the influence of a power\r\nwhich may prove greater than the love of truth. Such a press may screen\r\nabuses in government, or be silent. It may fear to speak. And may it not\r\nfear to speak, too, when its conductors, if they speak in any but one\r\nway, may lose their means of livelihood? Is dependence on government for\r\nbread no temptation to screen its abuses? Will the press always speak\r\nthe truth, when the truth, if spoken, may be the means of silencing it\r\nfor the future? Is the truth in no danger, is the watchman under no\r\ntemptation, when he can neither proclaim the approach of national evils,\r\nnor seem to descry them, without the loss of his place?\r\n\r\nMr. President, an open attempt to secure the aid and friendship of the\r\npublic press, by bestowing the emoluments of office on its active\r\nconductors, seems to me, of every thing we have witnessed, to be the\r\nmost reprehensible. It degrades both the government and the press.\r\nAs far as its natural effect extends, it turns the palladium of\r\nliberty into an engine of party. It brings the agency, activity,\r\nenergy, and patronage of government all to bear, with united force, on\r\nthe means of general intelligence, and on the adoption or rejection of\r\npolitical opinions. It so completely perverts the true object of\r\ngovernment, it so entirely revolutionizes our whole system, that the\r\nchief business of those in power is directed rather to the propagation\r\nof opinions favorable to themselves, than to the execution of the laws.\r\nThis propagation of opinions, through the press, becomes the main\r\nadministrative duty. Some fifty or sixty editors of leading journals\r\nhave been appointed to office by the present executive. A stand has\r\nbeen made against this proceeding, in the Senate, with partial\r\nsuccess; but, by means of appointments which do not come before the\r\nSenate, or other means, the number has been carried to the extent I have\r\nmentioned. Certainly, Sir, the editors of the public journals are\r\nnot to be disfranchised. Certainly they are fair candidates either for\r\npopular elections, or a just participation in office. Certainly they\r\nreckon in their number some of the first geniuses, the best scholars,\r\nand the most honest and well-principled men in the country. But the\r\ncomplaint is against the _system_, against the _practice_, against\r\nthe undisguised attempt to secure the favor of the press by means\r\naddressed to its pecuniary interest, and these means, too, drawn from\r\nthe public treasury, being no other than the appointed compensations\r\nfor the performance of official duties. Sir, the press itself should\r\nresent this. Its own character for purity and independence is at\r\nstake. It should resist a connection rendering it obnoxious to so\r\nmany imputations. It should point to its honorable denomination in our\r\nconstitutions of government, and it should maintain the character,\r\nthere ascribed to it, of a FREE PRESS.\r\n\r\nThere can, Sir, be no objection to the appointment of an editor to\r\noffice, if he is the fittest man. There can be no objection to\r\nconsidering the services which, in that or in any other capacity, he\r\nmay have rendered his country. He may have done much to maintain her\r\nrights against foreign aggression, and her character against insult.\r\nHe may have honored, as well as defended her; and may, therefore, be\r\njustly regarded and selected, in the choice of faithful public agents.\r\nBut the ground of complaint is, that the aiding, by the press, of the\r\nelection of an individual, is rewarded, by that same individual,\r\nwith the gift of moneyed offices. Men are turned out of office, and\r\nothers put in, and receive salaries from the public treasury, on the\r\nground, either openly avowed or falsely denied, that they have rendered\r\nservice in the election of the very individual who makes this removal\r\nand makes this appointment. Every man, Sir, must see that this is a\r\nvital stab at the purity of the press. It not only assails its\r\nindependence, by addressing sinister motives to it, but it furnishes\r\nfrom the public treasury the means of exciting these motives. It\r\nextends the executive power over the press in a most daring manner. It\r\noperates to give a direction to opinion, not favorable to the\r\ngovernment, in the aggregate; not favorable to the Constitution and\r\nlaws; not favorable to the legislature; but favorable to the executive\r\nalone. The consequence often is, just what might be looked for, that\r\nthe portion of the press thus made fast to the executive interest\r\ndenounces Congress, denounces the judiciary, complains of the laws,\r\nand quarrels with the Constitution. This exercise of the right of\r\nappointment to this end is an augmentation, and a vast one, of the\r\nexecutive power, singly and alone. It uses that power strongly against\r\nall other branches of the government, and it uses it strongly, too,\r\nfor any struggle which it may be called on to make with the public\r\nopinion of the country. Mr. President, I will quit this topic. There\r\nis much in it, in my judgment, affecting, not only the purity and\r\nindependence of the press, but also the character and honor, the\r\npeace and security, of the government. I leave it, in all its bearings,\r\nto the consideration of the people.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. President, among the novelties introduced into the government by the\r\npresent administration is the frequent use of the President's negative\r\non acts of Congress. Under former Presidents, this power has been deemed\r\nan extraordinary one, to be exercised only in peculiar and marked cases.\r\nIt was vested in the President, doubtless, as a guard against hasty or\r\ninconsiderate legislation, and against any act, inadvertently passed,\r\nwhich might seem to encroach on the just authority of other branches of\r\nthe government. I do not recollect that, by all General Jackson's\r\npredecessors, this power was exercised more than four or five times. Not\r\nhaving recurred to the journals, I cannot, of course, be sure that I am\r\nnumerically accurate in this particular; but such is my belief. I\r\nrecollect no instance in the time of Mr. John Adams, Mr. Jefferson, or\r\nMr. John Quincy Adams. The only cases which occur to me are two in\r\nGeneral Washington's administration, two in Mr. Madison's, and one in\r\nMr. Monroe's. There may be some others; but we all know that it is a\r\npower which has been very sparingly and reluctantly used, from the\r\nbeginning of the government. The cases, Sir, to which I have now\r\nreferred, were cases in which the President returned the bill with\r\nobjections. The silent veto is, I believe, the exclusive adoption of the\r\npresent administration. I think, indeed, that, some years ago, a bill,\r\nby inadvertence or accident, failed to receive the President's\r\nsignature, and so did not become a law. But I am not aware of any\r\ninstance, before the present administration, in which the President has,\r\nby design, omitted to sign a bill, and yet has not returned it to\r\nCongress. But since that administration came into power, the veto, in\r\nboth kinds, has been repeatedly applied. In the case of the Maysville\r\nRoad, the Montgomery Road, and the bank, we have had the veto, _with_\r\nreasons. In an internal improvement bill of a former session, in a\r\nsimilar bill at the late session, and in the State interest bill, we\r\nhave had the silent veto, or refusal _without_ reasons.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, it is to be considered, that the President has the power of\r\nrecommending measures to Congress. Through his friends, he may and does\r\noppose, also, any legislative movement which he does not approve. If, in\r\naddition to this, he may exercise a silent veto, at his pleasure, on all\r\nthe bills presented to him during the last ten days of the session; if\r\nhe may refuse assent to them all, without being called upon to assign\r\nany reasons whatever,--it will certainly be a great practical\r\naugmentation of his power. Any one, who looks at a volume of the\r\nstatutes, will see that a great portion of all the laws are actually\r\npassed within the last ten days of each session. If the President is at\r\nliberty to negative any or all of these laws, at pleasure, or rather, to\r\nrefuse to render the bills laws by approving them, and still may neglect\r\nto return them to Congress for renewed action, he will hold a very\r\nimportant control over the legislation of this country. The day of\r\nadjournment is usually fixed some weeks in advance. This being fixed, a\r\nlittle activity and perseverance may easily, in most cases, and perhaps\r\nin all, where no alarm has been excited, postpone important pending\r\nmeasures to a period within ten days of the close of the session; and\r\nthis operation subjects all such measures to the discretion of the\r\nPresident, who may sign the bills or not, without being obliged to state\r\nhis reasons publicly.\r\n\r\nThe bill for rechartering the bank would have been inevitably destroyed\r\nby the silent veto, if its friends had not refused to fix an any term\r\nfor adjournment before the President should have had the bill in his\r\npossession so long as to be required constitutionally to sign it, or to\r\nsend it back with his reasons for not signing it. The two houses did not\r\nagree, and would not agree, to fix a day for adjournment, until the bill\r\nwas sent to the President; and then care was taken to fix on such a day\r\nas should allow him the whole constitutional period. This seasonable\r\npresentment rescued the bill from the power of the silent negative.\r\n\r\nThis practical innovation on the mode of administering the government,\r\nso much at variance with its general principles, and so capable of\r\ndefeating the most useful acts, deserves public consideration. Its\r\ntendency is to disturb the harmony which ought always to exist between\r\nCongress and the executive, and to turn that which the Constitution\r\nintended only as an extraordinary remedy for extraordinary cases into a\r\ncommon means of making executive discretion paramount to the discretion\r\nof Congress, in the enactment of laws.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. President, the executive has not only used these unaccustomed means\r\nto prevent the passage of laws, but it has also refused to enforce the\r\nexecution of laws actually passed. An eminent instance of this is found\r\nin the course adopted relative to the Indian intercourse law of 1802.\r\nUpon being applied to, in behalf of the MISSIONARIES, to execute that\r\nlaw, for their relief and protection, the President replied, that, _the\r\nState of Georgia having extended her laws over the Indian territory, the\r\nlaws of Congress had thereby been superseded_. This is the substance of\r\nhis answer, as communicated through the Secretary of War. He holds,\r\nthen, that the law of the State is paramount to the law of Congress. The\r\nSupreme Court has adjudged this act of Georgia to be void, as being\r\nrepugnant to a constitutional law of the United States. But the\r\nPresident pays no more regard to this decision than to the act of\r\nCongress itself. The missionaries remain in prison, held there by a\r\ncondemnation under a law of a State which the supreme judicial tribunal\r\nhas pronounced to be null and void. The Supreme Court have decided that\r\nthe act of Congress is constitutional; that it is a binding statute;\r\nthat it has the same force as other laws, and is as much entitled to be\r\nobeyed and executed as other laws. The President, on the contrary,\r\ndeclares that the law of Congress has been superseded by the law of the\r\nState, and therefore he will not carry its provisions into effect. Now\r\nwe know, Sir, that the Constitution of the United States declares, that\r\nthat Constitution, and all acts of Congress passed in pursuance of it,\r\nshall be the supreme law of the land, any thing in any State law to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding. This would seem to be a plain case, then, in\r\nwhich the law should be executed. It has been solemnly decided to be in\r\nactual force, by the highest judicial authority; its execution is\r\ndemanded for the relief of free citizens, now suffering the pains of\r\nunjust and unlawful imprisonment; yet the President refuses to execute\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Chicago Road, some sessions ago, the President\r\napproved the bill, but accompanied his approval by a message, saying how\r\nfar he deemed it a proper law, and how far, therefore, it ought to be\r\ncarried into execution.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the harbor bill of the late session, being applied to by\r\na member of Congress for directions for carrying parts of the law into\r\neffect, he declined giving them, and made a distinction between such\r\nparts of the law as he should cause to be executed, and such as he\r\nshould not; and his right to make this distinction has been openly\r\nmaintained, by those who habitually defend his measures. Indeed, Sir,\r\nthese, and other instances of liberties taken with plain statute\r\nlaws, flow naturally from the principles expressly avowed by the\r\nPresident, under his own hand. In that important document, Sir, upon\r\nwhich it seems to be his fate to stand or to fall before the American\r\npeople, the veto message, he holds the following language:--\"Each\r\npublic officer who takes an oath to support the Constitution, swears\r\nthat he will support it as he understands it, and not as it is\r\nunderstood by others.\" Mr. President, the general adoption of the\r\nsentiments expressed in this sentence would dissolve our government.\r\nIt would raise every man's private opinions into a standard for his\r\nown conduct; and there certainly is, there can be, no government, where\r\nevery man is to judge for himself of his own rights and his own\r\nobligations. Where every one is his own arbiter, force, and not law,\r\nis the governing power. He who may judge for himself, and decide for\r\nhimself, must execute his own decisions; and this is the law of\r\nforce. I confess, Sir, it strikes me with astonishment, that so\r\nwild, so disorganizing, a sentiment should be uttered by a President\r\nof the United States. I should think it must have escaped from its\r\nauthor through want of reflection, or from the habit of little\r\nreflection on such subjects, if I could suppose it possible, that, on\r\na question exciting so much public attention, and of so much national\r\nimportance, any such extraordinary doctrine could find its way,\r\nthrough inadvertence, into a formal and solemn public act. Standing as\r\nit does, it affirms a proposition which would effectually repeal all\r\nconstitutional and all legal obligations. The Constitution declares,\r\nthat every public officer, in the State governments as well as in the\r\ngeneral government, shall take an oath to support the Constitution of\r\nthe United States. This is all. Would it not have cast an air of\r\nridicule on the whole provision, if the Constitution had gone on to add\r\nthe words, \"as he understands it\"? What could come nearer to a\r\nsolemn farce, than to bind a man by oath, and still leave him to be his\r\nown interpreter of his own obligation? Sir, those who are to execute\r\nthe laws have no more a license to construe them for themselves, than\r\nthose whose only duty is to obey them. Public officers are bound to\r\nsupport the Constitution; private citizens are bound to obey it; and\r\nthere is no more indulgence granted to the public officer to support\r\nthe Constitution only _as he understands it_, than to a private citizen\r\nto obey it only _as he understands it_; and what is true of the\r\nConstitution, in this respect, is equally true of any law. Laws are to\r\nbe executed, and to be obeyed, not as individuals may interpret\r\nthem, but according to public, authoritative interpretation and\r\nadjudication. The sentiment of the message would abrogate the\r\nobligation of the whole criminal code. If every man is to judge of\r\nthe Constitution and the laws for himself, if he is to obey and\r\nsupport them only as he may say he understands them, a revolution, I\r\nthink, would take place in the administration of justice; and\r\ndiscussions about the law of treason, murder, and arson should be\r\naddressed, not to the judicial bench, but to those who might stand\r\ncharged with such offences. The object of discussion should be, if we\r\nrun out this notion to its natural extent, to enlighten the culprit\r\nhimself how he ought to understand the law.\r\n\r\nMr. President, how is it possible that a sentiment so wild, and so\r\ndangerous, so encouraging to all who feel a desire to oppose the laws,\r\nand to impair the Constitution, should have been uttered by the\r\nPresident of the United States at this eventful and critical moment? Are\r\nwe not threatened with dissolution of the Union? Are we not told that\r\nthe laws of the government shall be openly and directly resisted? Is not\r\nthe whole country looking, with the utmost anxiety, to what may be the\r\nresult of these threatened courses? And at this very moment, so full of\r\nperil to the state, the chief magistrate puts forth opinions and\r\nsentiments as truly subversive of all government, as absolutely in\r\nconflict with the authority of the Constitution, as the wildest theories\r\nof nullification. Mr. President, I have very little regard for the law,\r\nor the logic, of nullification. But there is not an individual in its\r\nranks, capable of putting two ideas together, who, if you will grant him\r\nthe principles of the veto message, cannot defend all that nullification\r\nhas ever threatened.\r\n\r\nTo make this assertion good, Sir, let us see how the case stands. The\r\nLegislature of South Carolina, it is said, will nullify the late revenue\r\nor tariff law, because, _they say_, it is not warranted by the\r\nConstitution of the United States, _as they understand the\r\nConstitution_. They, as well as the President of the United States, have\r\nsworn to support the Constitution. Both he and they have taken the same\r\noath, in the same words. Now, Sir, since he claims the right to\r\ninterpret the Constitution as he pleases, how can he deny the same right\r\nto them? Is his oath less stringent than theirs? Has he a prerogative\r\nof dispensation which they do not possess? How can he answer them, when\r\nthey tell him, that the revenue laws are unconstitutional, _as they\r\nunderstand the Constitution_, and that therefore they will nullify them?\r\nWill he reply to them, according to the doctrines of his annual message\r\nin 1830, that _precedent_ has settled the question, if it was ever\r\ndoubtful? They will answer him in his own words in the veto message,\r\nthat, in such a case, _precedent_ is not binding. Will he say to them,\r\nthat the revenue law is a law of Congress, which must be executed until\r\nit shall be declared void? They will answer him, that, in other cases,\r\nhe has himself refused to execute laws of Congress which had not been\r\ndeclared void, but which had been, on the contrary, declared valid. Will\r\nhe urge the force of judicial decisions? They will answer, that he\r\nhimself does not admit the binding obligation of such decisions. Sir,\r\nthe President of the United States is of opinion, that an individual,\r\ncalled on to execute a law, may himself judge of its constitutional\r\nvalidity. Does nullification teach any thing more revolutionary than\r\nthat? The President is of opinion, that judicial interpretations of the\r\nConstitution and the laws do not bind the consciences, and ought not to\r\nbind the conduct, of men. Is nullification at all more disorganizing\r\nthan that? The President is of opinion, that every officer is bound to\r\nsupport the Constitution only according to what ought to be, in his\r\nprivate opinion, its construction. Has nullification, in its wildest\r\nflight, ever reached to an extravagance like that? No, Sir, never. The\r\ndoctrine of nullification, in my judgment a most false, dangerous, and\r\nrevolutionary doctrine, is this; that _the State_, or _a State_, may\r\ndeclare the extent of the obligations which its citizens are under to\r\nthe United States; in other words, that a State, by State laws and State\r\njudicatures, may conclusively construe the Constitution for its own\r\ncitizens. But that every individual may construe it for himself is a\r\nrefinement on the theory of resistance to constitutional power, a\r\nsublimation of the right of being disloyal to the Union, a free charter\r\nfor the elevation of private opinion above the authority of the\r\nfundamental law of the state, such as was never presented to the public\r\nview, and the public astonishment, even by nullification itself. Its\r\nfirst appearance is in the veto message. Melancholy, lamentable, indeed,\r\nSir, is our condition, when, at a moment of serious danger and\r\nwide-spread alarm, such sentiments are found to proceed from the chief\r\nmagistrate of the government. Sir, I cannot feel that the Constitution\r\nis safe in such hands. I cannot feel that the present administration is\r\nits fit and proper guardian.\r\n\r\nBut let me ask, Sir, what evidence there is, that the President is\r\nhimself opposed to the doctrines of nullification: I do not say to the\r\npolitical party which now pushes these doctrines, but to the doctrines\r\nthemselves. Has he anywhere rebuked them? Has he anywhere discouraged\r\nthem? Has his influence been exerted to inspire respect for the\r\nConstitution, and to produce obedience to the laws? Has he followed the\r\nbright example of his predecessors? Has he held fast by the institutions\r\nof the country? Has he summoned the good and the wise around him? Has he\r\nadmonished the country that the Union is in danger, and called on all\r\nthe patriotic to come out in its support? Alas! Sir, we have seen\r\nnothing, nothing, of all this.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I shall not discuss the doctrine of nullification. I am\r\nsure it can have no friends here. Gloss it and disguise it as we may, it\r\nis a pretence incompatible with the authority of the Constitution. If\r\ndirect separation be not its only mode of operation, separation is,\r\nnevertheless, its direct consequence. That a State may nullify a law of\r\nthe Union, and still remain in the Union; that she may have Senators and\r\nRepresentatives in the government, and yet be at liberty to disobey and\r\nresist that government; that she may partake in the common councils, and\r\nyet not be bound by their results; that she may control a law of\r\nCongress, so that it shall be one thing with her, while it is another\r\nthing with the rest of the States;--all these propositions seem to me so\r\nabsolutely at war with common sense and reason, that I do not understand\r\nhow any intelligent person can yield the slightest assent to them.\r\nNullification, it is in vain to attempt to conceal it, is dissolution;\r\nit is dismemberment; it is the breaking up of the Union. If it shall\r\npractically succeed in any one State, from that moment there are\r\ntwenty-four States in the Union no longer. Now, Sir, I think it\r\nexceedingly probable that the President may come to an open rupture with\r\nthat portion of his original party which now constitutes what is called\r\nthe Nullification party. I think it likely he will oppose the\r\nproceedings of that party, if they shall adopt measures coming directly\r\nin conflict with the laws of the United States. But how will he oppose?\r\nWhat will be his course of remedy? Sir, I wish to call the attention of\r\nthe Convention, and of the people, earnestly to this question,--How will\r\nthe President attempt to put down nullification, if he shall attempt it\r\nat all?\r\n\r\nSir, for one, I protest in advance against such remedies as I have heard\r\nhinted. The administration itself keeps a profound silence, but its\r\nfriends have spoken for it. We are told, Sir, that the President will\r\nimmediately employ the military force, and at once blockade Charleston!\r\nA military remedy, a remedy by direct belligerent operation, has been\r\nthus suggested, and nothing else has been suggested, as the intended\r\nmeans of preserving the Union. Sir, there is no little reason to think,\r\nthat this suggestion is true. We cannot be altogether unmindful of the\r\npast, and therefore we cannot be altogether unapprehensive for the\r\nfuture. For one, Sir, I raise my voice beforehand against the\r\nunauthorized employment of military power, and against superseding the\r\nauthority of the laws, by an armed force, under pretence of putting down\r\nnullification. The President has no authority to blockade Charleston;\r\nthe President has no authority to employ military force, till he shall\r\nbe duly required so to do, by law, and by the civil authorities. His\r\nduty is to cause the laws to be executed. His duty is to support the\r\ncivil authority. His duty is, if the laws be resisted, to employ the\r\nmilitary force of the country, if necessary, for their support and\r\nexecution; but to do all this in compliance only with law, and with\r\ndecisions of the tribunals. If, by any ingenious devices, those who\r\nresist the laws escape from the reach of judicial authority, as it is\r\nnow provided to be exercised, it is entirely competent to Congress to\r\nmake such new provisions as the exigency of the case may demand. These\r\nprovisions undoubtedly would be made. With a constitutional and\r\nefficient head of the government, with an administration really and\r\ntruly in favor of the Constitution, the country can grapple with\r\nnullification. By the force of reason, by the progress of enlightened\r\nopinion, by the natural, genuine patriotism of the country, and by the\r\nsteady and well-sustained operations of law, the progress of\r\ndisorganization may be successfully checked, and the Union maintained.\r\nLet it be remembered, that, where nullification is most powerful, it is\r\nnot unopposed. Let it be remembered, that they who would break up the\r\nUnion by force have to march toward that object through thick ranks of\r\nas brave and good men as the country can show; men strong in character,\r\nstrong in intelligence, strong in the purity of their own motives, and\r\nready, always ready, to sacrifice their fortunes and their lives to the\r\npreservation of the constitutional union of the States. If we can\r\nrelieve the country from an administration which denies to the\r\nConstitution those powers which are the breath of its life; if we can\r\nplace the government in the hands of its friends; if we can secure it\r\nagainst the dangers of irregular and unlawful military force; if it can\r\nbe under the lead of an administration whose moderation, firmness, and\r\nwisdom shall inspire confidence and command respect,--we may yet\r\nsurmount the dangers, numerous and formidable as they are, which\r\nsurround us.\r\n\r\nSir, I see little prospect of overcoming these dangers without a change\r\nof men. After all that has passed, the reflection of the present\r\nexecutive will give the national sanction to sentiments and to measures\r\nwhich will effectually change the government; which, in short, must\r\ndestroy the government. If the President be reflected, with concurrent\r\nand cooeperating majorities in both houses of Congress, I do not see,\r\nthat, in four years more, all the power which is suffered to remain in\r\nthe government will not be held by the executive hand. Nullification\r\nwill proceed, or will be put down by a power as unconstitutional as\r\nitself. The revenues will be managed by a treasury bank. The use of the\r\nveto will be considered as sanctioned by the public voice. The Senate,\r\nif not \"cut down,\" will be bound down, and, the President commanding the\r\narmy and the navy, and holding all places of trust to be party property,\r\nwhat will then be left, Sir, for constitutional reliance?\r\n\r\nSir, we have been accustomed to venerate the judiciary, and to repose\r\nhopes of safety on that branch of the government. But let us not deceive\r\nourselves. The judicial power cannot stand for a long time against the\r\nexecutive power. The judges, it is true, hold their places by an\r\nindependent tenure; but they are mortal. That which is the common lot of\r\nhumanity must make it necessary to renew the benches of justice. And how\r\nwill they be filled? Doubtless, Sir, they will be filled by judges\r\nagreeing with the President in his constitutional opinions. If the court\r\nis felt as an obstacle, the first opportunity and every opportunity\r\nwill certainly be embraced to give it less and less the character of an\r\nobstacle. Sir, without pursuing these suggestions, I only say that the\r\ncountry must prepare itself for any change in the judicial department\r\nsuch as it shall deliberately sanction in other departments.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, what is the prospect of change? Is there any hope that the\r\nnational sentiment will recover its accustomed tone, and restore to the\r\ngovernment a just and efficient administration?\r\n\r\nSir, if there be something of doubt on this point, there is also\r\nsomething, perhaps much, of hope. The popularity of the present\r\nchief magistrate, springing from causes not connected with his\r\nadministration of the government, has been great. Public gratitude\r\nfor military service has remained fast to him, in defiance of many\r\nthings in his civil administration calculated to weaken its hold. At\r\nlength there are indications, not to be mistaken, of new sentiments\r\nand new impressions. At length, a conviction of danger to important\r\ninterests, and to the security of the government, has made its\r\nlodgement in the public mind. At length, public sentiment begins to have\r\nits free course and to produce its just effects. I fully believe,\r\nSir, that a great majority of the nation desire a change in the\r\nadministration; and that it will be difficult for party organization\r\nor party denunciation to suppress the effective utterance of that\r\ngeneral wish. There are unhappy differences, it is true, about the\r\nfit person to be successor to the present incumbent in the chief\r\nmagistracy; and it is possible that this disunion may, in the end,\r\ndefeat the will of the majority. But so far as we agree together, let\r\nus act together. Wherever our sentiments concur, let our hands\r\ncooeperate. If we cannot at present agree who should be President, we are\r\nat least agreed who ought not to be. I fully believe, Sir, that\r\ngratifying intelligence is already on the wing. While we are yet\r\ndeliberating in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania is voting. This week, she\r\nelects her members to the next Congress. I doubt not the result of\r\nthat election will show an important change in public sentiment in\r\nthat State; nor can I doubt that the great States adjoining her,\r\nholding similar constitutional principles and having similar interests,\r\nwill feel the impulse of the same causes which affect her. The people\r\nof the United States, by a countless majority, are attached to the\r\nConstitution. If they shall be convinced that it is in danger, they\r\nwill come to its rescue, and will save it. It cannot bi destroyed,\r\neven now, if THEY will undertake its guardianship and protection.\r\n\r\nBut suppose, Sir, there was less hope than there is, would that\r\nconsideration weaken the force of our obligations? Are we at a post\r\nwhich we are at liberty to desert when it becomes difficult to hold it?\r\nMay we fly at the approach of danger? Does our fidelity to the\r\nConstitution require no more of us than to enjoy its blessings, to bask\r\nin the prosperity which it has shed around us and our fathers? and are\r\nwe at liberty to abandon it in the hour of its peril, or to make for it\r\nbut a faint and heartless struggle, for the want of encouragement and\r\nthe want of hope? Sir, if no State come to our succor, if everywhere\r\nelse the contest should be given up, here let it be protracted to the\r\nlast moment. Here, where the first blood of the Revolution was shed, let\r\nthe last effort be made for that which is the greatest blessing obtained\r\nby the Revolution, a free and united government. Sir, in our endeavors\r\nto maintain our existing forms of government, we are acting not for\r\nourselves alone, but for the great cause of constitutional liberty all\r\nover the globe. We are trustees holding a sacred treasure, in which all\r\nthe lovers of freedom have a stake. Not only in revolutionized France,\r\nwhere there are no longer subjects, where the monarch can no longer say,\r\nI am the state; not only in reformed England, where our principles, our\r\ninstitutions, our practice of free government, are now daily quoted and\r\ncommended; but in the depths of Germany, also, and among the desolated\r\nfields and the still smoking ashes of Poland, prayers are uttered for\r\nthe preservation of our union and happiness. We are surrounded, Sir, by\r\na cloud of witnesses. The gaze of the sons of liberty, everywhere, is\r\nupon us, anxiously, intently, upon us. They may see us fall in the\r\nstruggle for our Constitution and government, but Heaven forbid that\r\nthey should see us recreant.\r\n\r\nAt least, Sir, let the star of Massachusetts be the last which shall be\r\nseen to fall from heaven, and to plunge into the utter darkness of\r\ndisunion. Let her shrink back, let her hold others back if she can, at\r\nany rate, let her keep herself back, from this gulf, full at once of\r\nfire and of blackness; yes, Sir, as far as human foresight can scan, or\r\nhuman imagination fathom, full of the fire and the blood of civil war,\r\nand of the thick darkness of general political disgrace, ignominy, and\r\nrain. Though the worst may happen that can happen, and though she may\r\nnot be able to prevent the catastrophe, yet let her maintain her own\r\nintegrity, her own high honor, her own unwavering fidelity, so that with\r\nrespect and decency, though with a broken and a bleeding heart, she may\r\npay the last tribute to a glorious, departed, free Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [96] A Speech delivered at the National Republican Convention held at\r\n        Worcester, Mass., on the 12th of October, 1832, preparatory to\r\n        the Annual Elections.\r\n\r\n   [97] See page 269, _infra_.\r\n\r\n   [98] Hon.

On his way thither, while at Buffalo, New York, he was invited\r\n  by the citizens of that place to attend a public dinner, which his\r\n  engagements, and the necessity of an early departure, compelled him\r\n  to decline. He accepted, however, an invitation to be present at the\r\n  launching of a steamboat, to which the proprietors had given the\r\n  name of DANIEL WEBSTER, and, in reply to an address from one of\r\n  them, made the following remarks:--\r\n\r\n\r\nI avail myself gladly of this opportunity of making my acknowledgments\r\nto the proprietors of this vessel, for the honor conferred upon me by\r\nallowing her to bear my name. Such a token of regard, had it proceeded\r\nfrom my immediate friends and neighbors, could not but have excited\r\nfeelings of gratitude. It is more calculated to awaken these sentiments,\r\nwhen coming from gentlemen of character and worth with whom I have not\r\nhad the pleasure of personal acquaintance, and whose motive, I may\r\nflatter myself, is to be found in an indulgent opinion towards\r\nwell-intentioned services in a public situation.\r\n\r\nIt gives me great pleasure, also, on the occasion of so large an\r\nassembly of the people of Buffalo, to express to them my thanks for the\r\nkindness and hospitality with which I have been received in this young,\r\nbut growing and interesting city. The launching of another vessel on\r\nthese inland seas is but a fresh occasion of congratulation on the rapid\r\ngrowth, the great active prosperity, and the animating prospects of this\r\ncity. Eight years ago, fellow-citizens, I enjoyed the pleasure of a\r\nshort visit to this place. There was then but one steamboat on Lake\r\nErie; it made its passage once in ten or fifteen days only; and I\r\nremember that persons in my own vicinity, intending to travel to the Far\r\nWest by that conveyance, wrote to their friends here to learn the day of\r\nthe commencement of the contemplated voyage. I understand that there are\r\nnow eighteen steamboats plying on the lake, all finding full employment;\r\nand that a boat leaves Buffalo twice every day for Detroit and the ports\r\nin Ohio. The population of Buffalo, now four times as large as it was\r\nthen, has kept pace with the augmentation of its commercial business.\r\nThis rapid progress is an indication, in a single instance, of what is\r\nlikely to be the rate of the future progress of the city. So many\r\ncircumstances incline to favor its advancement, that it is difficult to\r\nestimate the rate by which it may hereafter proceed. It will probably\r\nnot be long before the products of the fisheries of the East, the\r\nimportations of the Atlantic frontier, the productions, mineral and\r\nvegetable, of all the Northwestern States, and the sugars of Louisiana,\r\nwill find their way hither by inland water communication. Much of this,\r\nindeed, has already taken place, and is of daily occurrence. Many, who\r\nremember the competition between Buffalo and Black Rock for the site of\r\nthe city, will doubtless live to see the city spread over both. This\r\nsingular prosperity, fellow-citizens, so gratifying for the present, and\r\naccompanied with such high hopes for the future, is due to your own\r\nindustry and enterprise, to your favored position, and to the\r\nflourishing condition of the internal commerce of the country; and the\r\nblessings and the riches of that internal commerce, be it ever\r\nremembered, are the fruits of a united government, and one general,\r\ncommon commercial system.\r\n\r\nIt is not only the trade of New York, of Ohio, of New England, of\r\nIndiana, or of Michigan, but it is a part of the great aggregate of the\r\ntrade of all the States, in which you so largely and so successfully\r\npartake. Who does not see that the advantages here enjoyed spring from a\r\ngeneral government and a uniform code? Who does not see, that, if these\r\nStates had remained severed, and each had existed with a system of\r\nimposts and commercial regulations of its own, all excluding and\r\nrepelling, rather than inviting, the intercourse of the rest, the place\r\ncould hardly have hoped to be more than a respectable frontier post? Or\r\ncan any man look to the one and to the other side of this beautiful\r\nlake and river, and not see, in their different conditions, the plain\r\nand manifest results of different political institutions and commercial\r\nregulations?\r\n\r\nIt would be pleasant, fellow-citizens, to dwell on these topics, so\r\nworthy at all times of regard and reflection; and especially so fit to\r\nengage attention at the present moment. But this is not the proper\r\nmoment to pursue them; and, tendering to you once more my thanks and\r\ngood wishes, I take my leave of you by expressing my hope for the\r\ncontinued success of that great interest, so essential to your\r\nhappiness,--THE COMMERCE OF THE LAKES, A NEW-DISCOVERED SOURCE OF\r\nNATIONAL PROSPERITY, AND A NEW BOND OF NATIONAL UNION.\r\n\r\n  An address was also made to Mr. Webster in behalf of the mechanics\r\n  and manufacturers of Buffalo, to which he returned the following\r\n  reply:--\r\n\r\nI need hardly say, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, that it gives me much\r\nsatisfaction to receive this mark of approbation of my public conduct\r\nfrom the manufacturers and mechanics of Buffalo. Those who are the most\r\nimmediately affected by the measures of the government are naturally the\r\nearliest to perceive their operation, and to foresee their final\r\nresults. Allow me to say, Gentlemen, that the confidence expressed by\r\nyou in my continuance in the general course which I have pursued must\r\nrest, and may rest safely, I trust, on the history of the past. Desiring\r\nalways to avoid extremes, and to observe a prudent moderation in regard\r\nto the protective system, I yet hold steadiness and perseverance, in\r\nmaintaining what has been established, to be essential to the public\r\nprosperity. Nothing can be worse than that laws concerning the daily\r\nlabor and the daily bread of whole classes of the people should be\r\nsubject to frequent and violent changes. It were far better not to move\r\nat all than to move forward and then fall back again.\r\n\r\nMy sentiments, Gentlemen, on the tariff question, are generally\r\nknown. In my opinion, a just and a leading object in the whole system is\r\nthe encouragement and protection of American manual labor. I confess,\r\nthat every day's experience convinces me more and more of the high\r\npropriety of regarding this object. Our government is made for all,\r\nnot for a few. Its object is to promote the greatest good of the whole;\r\nand this ought to be kept constantly in view in its administration.\r\nThe far greater number of those who maintain the government belong\r\nto what may be called the industrious or productive classes of the\r\ncommunity. With us labor is not depressed, ignorant, and unintelligent.\r\nOn the contrary, it is active, spirited, enterprising, seeking its own\r\nrewards, and laying up for its own competence and its own support. The\r\nmotive to labor is the great stimulus to our whole society; and no\r\nsystem is wise or just which does not afford this stimulus, as far as\r\nit may. The protection of American labor against the injurious\r\ncompetition of foreign labor, so far, at least, as respects general\r\nhandicraft productions, is known historically to have been one end\r\ndesigned to be obtained by establishing the Constitution; and this\r\nobject, and the constitutional power to accomplish it, ought never in\r\nany degree to be surrendered or compromised.\r\n\r\nOur political institutions, Gentlemen, place power in the hands of all\r\nthe people; and to make the exercise of this power, in such hands,\r\nsalutary, it is indispensable that all the people should enjoy, first,\r\nthe means of education, and, second, the reasonable certainty of\r\nprocuring a competent livelihood by industry and labor. These\r\ninstitutions are neither designed for, nor suited to, a nation of\r\nignorant paupers. To disseminate knowledge, then, universally, and to\r\nsecure to labor and industry their just rewards, is the duty both of the\r\ngeneral and the State governments, each in the exercise of its\r\nappropriate powers. To be free, the people must be intelligently free;\r\nto be substantially independent, they must be able to secure themselves\r\nagainst want, by sobriety and industry; to be safe depositaries of\r\npolitical power, they must be able to comprehend and understand the\r\ngeneral interests of the community, and must themselves have a stake in\r\nthe welfare of that community. The interest of labor, therefore, has an\r\nimportance, in our system, beyond what belongs to it as a mere question\r\nof political economy. It is connected with our forms of government, and\r\nour whole social system. The activity and prosperity which at present\r\nprevail among us, as every one must notice, are produced by the\r\nexcitement of compensating prices to labor; and it is fervently to be\r\nhoped that no unpropitious circumstances and no unwise policy may\r\ncounteract this efficient cause of general competency and public\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nI pray you, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, to receive personally my thanks\r\nfor the manner in which you have communicated to me the sentiments of\r\nthe meeting which you represent.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n  [101] Remarks made to the Citizens of Buffalo, June, 1833.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEPTION AT PITTSBURG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Webster arrived at Pittsburg on the evening of the 4th of July\r\n  accompanied by a numerous cavalcade of citizens.

It will be deeply\r\nmortifying to us, if our execution of this trust shall fail adequately\r\nto represent the enthusiastic feeling in which it had its origin.\r\n\r\n\"The committee will have the honor of waiting on you in person, at such\r\nan hour as you may please to designate, with a view to ascertain how\r\nthey can best fulfil the purposes of their appointment. It will be very\r\ngratifying if your convenience will permit you to partake of a public\r\ndinner at any period during your stay.\r\n\r\n\"We have the honor to be, with the highest respect, &c.\r\n\r\n  JAMES ROSS,\r\n  BENJAMIN BAKEWELL,\r\n  CHARLES AVERY,\r\n  WILLIAM WADE,\r\n  SAMUEL PETTIGREW,\r\n  GEORGE MILTENBERGER,\r\n  ISAAC LIGHTNER,\r\n  SYLVANUS LATHROP,\r\n  JOHN ARTHURS,\r\n  ALEX.

The terms in which you\r\nexpress their sentiments, in your letter of yesterday, far transcend all\r\nmerits of mine, and can have their origin only in spontaneous kindness\r\nand good feeling. I tender to you, Gentlemen, and to the meeting which\r\nyou represent, my warmest acknowledgments. I rejoice sincerely to find\r\nthe health of the city so satisfactory; and I reciprocate with all the\r\npeople of Pittsburg the most sincere and hearty good wishes for their\r\nprosperity and happiness. Long may it continue what it now is, an abode\r\nof comfort and hospitality, a refuge for the well-deserving from all\r\nnations, a model of industry, and an honor to the country.\r\n\r\n\"It is my purpose, Gentlemen, to stay a day or two among you, to see\r\nsuch of your manufactories and public institutions as it may be in my\r\npower to visit. I most respectfully pray leave to decline a public\r\ndinner, but shall have great pleasure in meeting such of your\r\nfellow-citizens as may desire it, in the most friendly and unceremonious\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\"I am, Gentlemen, with very true regard, yours,\r\n\r\n\"DANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n\"To HON. JAMES ROSS and others, Gentlemen of the Committee.\"\r\n\r\n  In deference to Mr. Webster's wishes, the idea of a formal dinner\r\n  was abandoned; but, as there was a general desire for some\r\n  collective expression of public esteem, it was determined to invite\r\n  him to meet the citizens in a spacious grove, at four o'clock on the\r\n  afternoon of the 8th. Refreshments of a plain kind were spread\r\n  around, under the charge of the committee; but the tables could\r\n  serve only as a nucleus to the multitude. His Honor the Mayor called\r\n  the company to order, and addressed them as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"I have to ask, Gentlemen, your attention for a few moments.\r\n\r\n\"We are met here to mark our sense of the extraordinary merits of a\r\ndistinguished statesman and public benefactor. At his particular\r\nrequest, every thing like parade or ceremonial has been waived; and, in\r\nconsequence, he has been the better enabled to receive, and to\r\nreciprocate, the hearty and spontaneous expression of your good-will. I\r\nam now desired to attempt, in your name, to give utterance to the\r\nuniversal feeling around me.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, we are this day citizens of the _United_ States. The Union\r\nis safe. Not a star has fallen from that proud banner around which our\r\naffections have so long rallied. And when, with this delightful\r\nassurance, we cast our eyes back upon the eventful history of the last\r\nyear,--when we recall the gloomy apprehensions, and perhaps hopeless\r\ndespondency, which came over us,--who, Gentlemen, can learn, without a\r\nglow of enthusiasm, that the great champion of the Constitution, that\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER, is now in the midst of us. To his mighty intellect, the\r\nnation, with one voice, confided its cause,--of life or death. Shall\r\nthere be withheld from the triumphant advocate of the nation a nation's\r\ngratitude? Ours, Gentlemen, is a government not of force, but of\r\nopinion. The reason of the people must be satisfied before a call to\r\narms. The mass of our peaceful and conscientious citizens cannot, and\r\nought not, except in a clear case, to be urged to abandon the implements\r\nof industry for the sword and the bayonet. This consideration it is that\r\nimparts to intellectual preeminence in the service of truth its\r\nincalculable value. And hence the preciousness of that admirable and\r\nunanswerable exposition, which has put down, once and for ever, the\r\nartful sophisms of nullification.\r\n\r\n\"If, Gentlemen, we turn to other portions of the public history of our\r\ndistinguished guest, it will be found that his claims to grateful\r\nacknowledgment are not less imposing. The cause of domestic industry, of\r\ninternal improvement, of education, of whatever, in short, is calculated\r\nto render us a prosperous, united, and happy people, has found in him a\r\nwatchful and efficient advocate. Nor is it the least of his merits, that\r\nto our gallant _Navy_ Mr. Webster has been an early, far-sighted, and\r\npersevering friend. Our interior position cannot render us cold and\r\nunobservant on this point, whilst the victory of Perry yet supplies to\r\nus a proud and inspiring anniversary. And such is the wonderful chain of\r\nmutual dependence which binds our Union, that, in the remotest corner of\r\nthe West, the exchangeable value of every product must depend on the\r\nsecurity with which the ocean can be traversed.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, I have detained you too long; yet I will add one word. I do\r\nbut echo the language of the throngs that have crowded round Mr. Webster\r\nin declaring, that the frank and manly simplicity of his character and\r\nmanners has created a feeling of personal regard which no mere\r\nintellectual ascendency could have secured. We approached him with\r\nadmiration for the achievements of his public career, never supposing\r\nfor a moment that our hearts could have aught to do in the matter; we\r\nshall part as from a valued friend, the recollection of whose virtues\r\ncannot pass away.\"\r\n\r\n  MR. WEBSTER then addressed the assembly as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEPTION AT PITTSBURG.[102]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Mayor and Gentlemen:--I rise, fellow-citizens, with unaffected\r\nsensibility, to give you my thanks for the hospitable manner in which\r\nyou have been kind enough to receive me, on this my first visit to\r\nPittsburg, and to make all due acknowledgments to your worthy Mayor, for\r\nthe sentiments which he has now seen fit to express.\r\n\r\nAlthough, Gentlemen, it has been my fortune to be personally acquainted\r\nwith very few of you, I feel, at this moment, that we are not strangers.\r\nWe are fellow-countrymen, fellow-citizens, bound together by a thousand\r\nties of interest, of sympathy, of duty; united, I hope I may add, by\r\nbonds of mutual regard. We are bound together, for good or for evil, in\r\nour great political interests. I know that I am addressing Americans,\r\nevery one of whom has a true American heart in his bosom; and I feel\r\nthat I have also an American heart in my bosom. I address you, then,\r\nGentlemen, with the same fervent good wishes for your happiness, the\r\nsame brotherly affection, and the same feelings of regard and esteem, as\r\nif, instead of being upon the borders of the Ohio, I stood by the\r\nConnecticut or the Merrimack. As citizens, countrymen, and neighbors, I\r\ngive you my hearty good wishes, and thank you, over and over again, for\r\nyour abundant hospitality.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, the Mayor has been pleased to advert, in terms beyond all\r\nexpectation or merit of my own, to my services in defence of the\r\nglorious Constitution under which we live, and which makes you and me\r\nall that we are, and all that we desire to be. He has done much more\r\nthan justice to my efforts; but he has not overstated the importance of\r\nthe occasion on which those efforts were made.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it is but a few short months since dark and portentous clouds\r\n_did_ hang over our heavens, and _did_ shut out, as it were, the sun in\r\nhis glory. A new and perilous crisis was upon us. Dangers, novel in\r\ntheir character, and fearful in their aspect, menaced both the peace of\r\nthe country and the integrity of the Constitution. For forty years our\r\ngovernment had gone on, I need hardly say how prosperously and\r\ngloriously, meeting, it is true, with occasional dissatisfaction, and,\r\nin one or two instances, with ill-concerted resistance to law. Through\r\nall these trials it had successfully passed. But now a time had come\r\nwhen the authority of law was opposed by authority of law, when the\r\npower of the general government was resisted by the arms of State\r\ngovernment, and when organized military force, under all the sanctions\r\nof State conventions and State laws, was ready to resist the collection\r\nof the public revenues, and hurl defiance at the statutes of Congress.\r\n\r\n'Gentlemen, this was an alarming moment. In common with all good\r\ncitizens, I felt it to be such. A general anxiety pervaded the breasts\r\nof all who were, at home, partaking in the prosperity, honor, and\r\nhappiness which the country had enjoyed. And how was it abroad? Why,\r\nGentlemen, every intelligent friend of human liberty, throughout the\r\nworld, looked with amazement at the spectacle which we exhibited. In a\r\nday of unparalleled prosperity, after a half-century's most happy\r\nexperience of the blessings of our Union; when we had already become the\r\nwonder of all the liberal part of the world, and the envy of the\r\nilliberal; when the Constitution had so amply falsified the predictions\r\nof its enemies, and more than fulfilled all the hopes of its friends; in\r\na time of peace, with an overflowing treasury; when both the population\r\nand the improvement of the country had outrun the most sanguine\r\nanticipations;--it was at this moment that we showed ourselves to the\r\nwhole civilized world as being apparently on the eve of disunion and\r\nanarchy, at the very point of dissolving, once and for ever, that Union\r\nwhich had made us so prosperous and so great. It was at this moment that\r\nthose appeared among us who seemed ready to break up the national\r\nConstitution, and to scatter the twenty-four States into twenty-four\r\nunconnected communities.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, the President of the United States was, as it seemed to me,\r\nat this eventful crisis, true to his duty. He comprehended and\r\nunderstood the case, and met it as it was proper to meet it. While I am\r\nas willing as others to admit that the President has, on other\r\noccasions, rendered important services to the country, and especially on\r\nthat occasion which has given him so much military renown, I yet think\r\nthe ability and decision with which he rejected the disorganizing\r\ndoctrines of nullification create a claim, than which he has none\r\nhigher, to the gratitude of the country and the respect of posterity.\r\nThe appearance of the proclamation of the 10th of December inspired me,\r\nI confess, with new hopes for the duration of the republic. I regarded\r\nit as just, patriotic, able, and imperiously demanded by the condition\r\nof the country. I would not be understood to speak of particular clauses\r\nand phrases in the proclamation; but I regard its great and leading\r\ndoctrines as the true and only true doctrines of the Constitution. They\r\nconstitute the sole ground on which dismemberment can be resisted.\r\nNothing else, in my opinion, can hold us together. While these opinions\r\nare maintained, the Union will last; when they shall be generally\r\nrejected and abandoned, that Union will be at the mercy of a temporary\r\nmajority in any one of the States.\r\n\r\nI speak, Gentlemen, on this subject, without reserve. I have not\r\nintended heretofore, and elsewhere, and do not now intend here, to stint\r\nmy commendation of the conduct of the President in regard to the\r\nproclamation and the subsequent measures. I have differed with the\r\nPresident, as all know, who know any thing of so humble an individual as\r\nmyself, on many questions of great general interest and importance. I\r\ndiffer with him in respect to the constitutional power of internal\r\nimprovements; I differ with him in respect to the rechartering of the\r\nBank, and I dissent, especially, from the grounds and reasons on which\r\nhe refused his assent to the bill passed by Congress for that purpose. I\r\ndiffer with him, also, probably, in the degree of protection which ought\r\nto be afforded to our agriculture and manufactures, and in the manner in\r\nwhich it may be proper to dispose of the public lands. But all these\r\ndifferences afforded, in my judgment, not the slightest reason for\r\nopposing him in a measure of paramount importance, and at a moment of\r\ngreat public exigency. I sought to take counsel of nothing but\r\npatriotism, to feel no impulse but that of duty, and to yield not a\r\nlame and hesitating, but a vigorous and cordial, support to measures\r\nwhich, in my conscience, I believed essential to the preservation of the\r\nConstitution. It is true, doubtless, that if myself and others had\r\nsurrendered ourselves to a spirit of opposition, we might have\r\nembarrassed, and probably defeated, the measures of the administration.\r\nBut in so doing, we should, in my opinion, have been false to our own\r\ncharacters, false to our duty, and false to our country. It gives me the\r\nhighest satisfaction to know, that, in regard to this subject, the\r\ngeneral voice of the country does not disapprove my conduct.\r\n\r\nI ought to add, Gentlemen, that, in whatever I may have done or\r\nattempted in this respect, I only share a common merit. A vast majority\r\nof both houses of Congress cordially concurred in the measures. Your own\r\ngreat State was seen in her just position on that occasion, and your own\r\nimmediate representatives were found among the most zealous and\r\nefficient friends of the Union.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I hope that the result of that experiment may prove\r\nsalutary in its consequences to our government, and to the interests\r\nof the community. I hope that the signal and decisive manifestation of\r\npublic opinion, which has, for the time at least, put down the\r\ndespotism of nullification, may produce permanent good effects. I know\r\nfull well that popular topics may be urged against the proclamation.\r\nI know it may be said, in regard to the laws of the last session,\r\nthat, if such laws are to be maintained, Congress may pass what laws\r\nthey please, and enforce them. But may it not be said, on the other\r\nside, that, if a State may nullify one law, she may nullify any other\r\nlaw also, and, therefore, that the _principle_ strikes at the whole\r\npower of Congress? And when it is said, that, if the power of State\r\ninterposition be denied, Congress may pass and enforce what laws it\r\npleases, is it meant to be contended or insisted, that the Constitution\r\nhas placed Congress under the guardianship and control of the State\r\nlegislatures? Those who argue against the power of Congress, from the\r\npossibility of its abuse, entirely forget that, if the power of\r\nState interposition be allowed, that power may be abused also. What is\r\nmore material, they forget the will of the people, as they have plainly\r\nexpressed it in the Constitution. They forget that _the people have\r\nchosen_ to give Congress a power of legislation, independent of State\r\ncontrol. They forget that the Confederation has ceased, and that a\r\n_Constitution_, a _government_, has taken its place. They forget that\r\nthis government is a popular government, that members of Congress are\r\nbut agents and servants of the people, chosen for short periods,\r\nperiodically removable by the people, as much subservient, as much\r\ndependent, as willingly obedient, as any other of their agents and\r\nservants. This dependence on the people is the security that they will\r\nnot act wrong. This is the security which the people themselves have\r\nchosen to rely on, in addition to the guards contained in the\r\nConstitution itself.\r\n\r\nI am quite aware, Gentlemen, that it is easy for those who oppose\r\nmeasures deemed necessary for the execution of the laws, to raise the\r\ncry of _consolidation_. It is easy to make charges, and to bring general\r\naccusations. It is easy to call names. For one, I repel all such\r\nimputations. I am no _consolidationist_. I disclaim the character\r\naltogether, and, instead of repeating this general and vague charge, I\r\nwill be obliged to any one to show how the proclamation, or the late law\r\nof Congress, or, indeed, any measure to which I ever gave my support,\r\ntends, in the slightest degree, to consolidation. By consolidation is\r\nunderstood a grasping at power, on behalf of the general government, not\r\nconstitutionally conferred. But the proclamation asserted no new power.\r\nIt only asserted the right in the government to carry into effect, in\r\nthe form of law, power which it had exercised for forty years. I should\r\noppose any grasping at new powers by Congress, as zealously as the most\r\nzealous. I wish to preserve the Constitution as it is, without addition,\r\nand without diminution, by one jot or tittle. For the same reason that I\r\nwould not grasp at powers not given, I would not surrender nor abandon\r\npowers which are given. Those who have placed me in a public station\r\nplaced me there, not to alter the Constitution, but to administer it.\r\nThe power of change the people have retained to themselves. _They_ can\r\nalter, they can modify, they can change the Constitution entirely, if\r\nthey see fit. _They_ can tread it under foot, and make another, or make\r\nno other; but while it remains unaltered by the authority of the people,\r\nit is our power of attorney, our letter of credit, our credentials; and\r\nwe are to follow it, and obey its injunctions, and maintain its just\r\npowers, to the best of our abilities. I repeat, that, for one, I seek\r\nto preserve to the Constitution those precise powers with which the\r\npeople have clothed it. While no encroachment is to be made on the\r\nreserved rights of the people or of the States, while nothing is to be\r\nusurped, it is equally clear that we are not at liberty to surrender,\r\neither in fact or form, any power or principle which the Constitution\r\ndoes actually contain.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the ground for this cry of consolidation? I maintain that\r\nthe measures recommended by the President, and adopted by Congress, were\r\nmeasures of self-defence. Is it consolidation to execute laws? Is it\r\nconsolidation to resist the force that is threatening to upturn our\r\ngovernment? Is it consolidation to protect officers, in the discharge of\r\ntheir duty, from courts and juries previously sworn to decide against\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I take occasion to remark, that, after much reflection upon\r\nthe subject, and after all that has been said about the encroachment of\r\nthe general government upon the rights of the States, I know of no one\r\npower, exercised by the general government, which was not, when that\r\ninstrument was adopted, admitted by the immediate friends and foes of\r\nthe Constitution to have been conferred upon it by the people. I know of\r\nno one power, now claimed or exercised, which every body did not agree,\r\nin 1789, was conferred on the general government. On the contrary, there\r\nare several powers, and those, too, among the most important for the\r\ninterests of the people, which were then universally allowed to be\r\nconferred on Congress by the Constitution of the United States, and\r\nwhich are now ingeniously doubted, or clamorously denied.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, upon this point I shall detain you with no further remarks.\r\nIt does, however, give me the most sincere pleasure to say, that, in a\r\nlong visit through the State west of you, and the great State north of\r\nyou, as well as in a tour of some days' duration in the respectable\r\nState to which you belong, I find but one sentiment in regard to the\r\nconduct of the government upon this subject. I know that those who have\r\nseen fit to intrust to me, in part, their interests in Congress, approve\r\nof the measures recommended by the President. We see that he has taken\r\noccasion, during the recess of Congress, to visit that part of the\r\ncountry; and we know how he has been received. Nowhere have hands been\r\nextended with more sincerity of friendship; and for one, Gentlemen, I\r\ntake occasion to say, that, having heard of his return to the seat of\r\ngovernment with health rather debilitated, it is among my most earnest\r\nprayers that Providence may spare his life, and that he may go through\r\nhis administration and come out of it with as much success and glory as\r\nany of his predecessors.\r\n\r\nYour worthy chief magistrate has been kind enough, Gentlemen, to express\r\nsentiments favorable to myself, as a friend of domestic industry.\r\nDomestic industry! How much of national power and opulence, how much of\r\nindividual comfort and respectability, that phrase implies! And with\r\nwhat force does it strike us, as we stand here, at the confluence of the\r\ntwo rivers whose united currents constitute the Ohio, and in the midst\r\nof one of the most flourishing and distinguished manufacturing cities in\r\nthe Union! Many thousand miles of inland navigation, running through a\r\nnew and rapidly-improving country, stretch away below us. Internal\r\ncommunications, completed or in progress, connect the city with the\r\nAtlantic and the Lakes. A hundred steam-engines are in daily operation,\r\nand nature has supplied the fuel which feeds their incessant flames on\r\nthe spot itself, in exhaustless abundance. Standing here, Gentlemen, in\r\nthe midst of such a population, and with such a scene around us, how\r\ngreat is the import of these words, \"domestic industry\"!\r\n\r\nNext to the preservation of the government itself, there can hardly be a\r\nmore vital question, to such a community as this, than that which\r\nregards their own employments, and the preservation of that policy which\r\nthe government has adopted and cherished for the encouragement and\r\nprotection of those employments. This is not, in a society like this, a\r\nmatter which affects the interest of a particular class, but one which\r\naffects the interest of all classes. It runs through the whole chain of\r\nhuman occupation and employment, and touches the means of living and the\r\ncomfort of all.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, those of you who may have turned your attention to the\r\nsubject know, that, in the quarter of the country with which I am more\r\nimmediately connected, the people were not early or eager to urge the\r\ngovernment to carry the protective policy to the height which it has\r\nreached. Candor obliges me to remind you, that, when the act of 1824 was\r\npassed, neither he who now addresses you, nor those with whom he\r\nusually acted on such subjects, were ready or willing to take the step\r\nwhich that act proposed. They doubted its _expediency_. It passed,\r\nhowever, by the great and overwhelming influence of the central States,\r\nNew York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. New England acquiesced in it. She\r\nconformed to it, as the settled policy of the country, and gave to her\r\ncapital and her labor a corresponding direction. She has now become\r\nvitally interested in the preservation of the system. Her prosperity is\r\nidentified, not perhaps with any particular degree of protection, but\r\nwith the preservation of the principle; and she is not likely to consent\r\nto yield the principle, under any circumstances whatever. And who would\r\ndare to yield it? Who, standing here, and looking round on this\r\ncommunity and its interests, would be bold enough to touch the spring\r\nwhich moves so much industry and produces so much happiness? Who would\r\nshut up the mouths of these vast coal-pits? Who would stay the cargoes\r\nof manufactured goods, now floating down a river, one of the noblest in\r\nthe world, and stretching through territories almost boundless in extent\r\nand unequalled in fertility? Who would quench the fires of so many\r\nsteam-engines, or check the operations of so much well-employed labor?\r\nGentlemen, I cannot conceive how any subversion of that policy which has\r\nhitherto been pursued can take place, without great public embarrassment\r\nand great private distress.\r\n\r\nI have said, that I am in favor of protecting American manual labor; and\r\nafter the best reflection I can give the subject, and from the lights\r\nwhich I can derive from the experience of ourselves and others, I have\r\ncome to the conclusion that such protection is just and proper; and that\r\nto leave American labor to sustain a competition with that of the\r\nover-peopled countries of Europe would lead to a state of things to\r\nwhich the people could never submit. This is the great reason why I am\r\nfor maintaining what has been established. I see at home, I see here, I\r\nsee wherever I go, that the stimulus which has excited the existing\r\nactivity, and is producing the existing prosperity, of the country, is\r\nnothing else than the stimulus held out to labor by compensating prices.\r\nI think this effect is visible everywhere, from Penobscot to New\r\nOrleans, and manifest in the condition and circumstances of the great\r\nbody of the people; for nine tenths of the whole people belong to the\r\nlaborious, industrious, and productive classes; and on these classes the\r\nstimulus acts. We perceive that the price of labor is high, and we know\r\nthat the means of living are low; and these two truths speak volumes in\r\nfavor of the general prosperity of the country. I am aware, as has been\r\nsaid already, that this high price of labor results partly from the\r\nfavorable condition of the country. Labor was high, comparatively\r\nspeaking, before the act of 1824 passed; but that fact affords no\r\nreason, in my judgment, for endangering its security and sacrificing its\r\nhopes, by overthrowing what has since been established for its\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nLet us look, Gentlemen, to the condition of other countries, and inquire\r\na little into the causes, which, in some of them, produce poverty and\r\ndistress, the lamentations of which reach our own shores. I see around\r\nme many whom I know to be emigrants from other countries. Why are they\r\nhere? Why is the native of Ireland among us? Why has he abandoned scenes\r\nas dear to him as these hills and these rivers are to you? Is there any\r\nother cause than this, that the burden of taxation on the one hand, and\r\nthe low reward of labor on the other, left him without the means of a\r\ncomfortable subsistence, or the power of providing for those who were\r\ndependent upon him? Was it not on this account that he left his own\r\nland, and sought an asylum in a country of free laws, of comparative\r\nexemption from taxation, of boundless extent, and in which the means of\r\nliving are cheap, and the prices of labor just and adequate? And do not\r\nthese remarks apply, with more or less accuracy, to every other part of\r\nEurope? Is it not true, that sobriety, and industry, and good character,\r\ncan do more for a man here than in any other part of the world? And is\r\nnot this truth, which is so obvious that none can deny it, founded in\r\nthis plain reason, that labor in this country earns a better reward than\r\nanywhere else, and so gives more comfort, more individual independence,\r\nand more elevation of character? Whatever else may benefit particular\r\nportions of society, whatever else may assist capital, whatever else may\r\nfavor sharp-sighted commercial enterprise, professional skill, or\r\nextraordinary individual sagacity or good fortune, be assured,\r\nGentlemen, that nothing can advance the mass of society in prosperity\r\nand happiness, nothing can uphold the substantial interest and steadily\r\nimprove the general condition and character of the whole, but this one\r\nthing, _compensating rewards to labor_. The fortunate situation of our\r\ncountry tends strongly, of itself, to produce this result; the\r\ngovernment has adopted the policy of cooeperating with this natural\r\ntendency of things; it has encouraged and fostered labor and industry,\r\nby a system of discriminating duties; and the result of these combined\r\ncauses may be seen in the present circumstances of the country.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, there are important considerations of another kind connected\r\nwith this subject. Our government is popular; popular in its foundation,\r\nand popular in its exercise. The actual character of the government can\r\nnever be better than the general moral and intellectual character of the\r\ncommunity. It would be the wildest of human imaginations, to expect a\r\npoor, vicious, and ignorant people to maintain a good popular\r\ngovernment. Education and knowledge, which, as is obvious, can be\r\ngenerally attained by the people only where there are adequate rewards\r\nto labor and industry, and some share in the public interest, some stake\r\nin the community, would seem indispensably necessary in those who have\r\nthe power of appointing all public agents, passing all laws, and even of\r\nmaking and unmaking constitutions at their pleasure. Hence the truth of\r\nthe trite maxim, that knowledge and virtue are the only foundation of\r\nrepublics. But it is to be added, and to be always remembered, that\r\nthere never was, and never can be, an intelligent and virtuous people\r\nwho at the same time are a poor and idle people, badly employed and\r\nbadly paid. Who would be safe in any community, where political power is\r\nin the hands of the many and property in the hands of the few? Indeed,\r\nsuch an unnatural state of things could nowhere long exist.\r\n\r\nIt certainly appears to me, Gentlemen, to be quite evident at this time,\r\nand in the present condition of the world, that it is necessary to\r\nprotect the industry of this country against the pauper labor of England\r\nand other parts of Europe. An American citizen, who has children to\r\nmaintain and children to _educate_, has an unequal chance against the\r\npauper of England, whose children are not to be educated, and are\r\nprobably already on the parish, and who himself is half fed and clothed\r\nby his own labor, and half from the poor-rates, and very badly fed and\r\nclothed after all. As I have already said, the condition of our country\r\nof itself, without the aid of government, does much to favor American\r\nmanual labor; and it is a question of policy and justice, at all times,\r\nwhat and how much government shall do in aid of natural advantages. In\r\nregard to some branches of industry, the natural advantages are less\r\nconsiderable than in regard to others; and those, therefore, more\r\nimperiously demand the regard of government. Such are the occupations,\r\ngenerally speaking, of the numerous classes of citizens in cities and\r\nlarge towns; the workers in leather, brass, tin, iron, &c.; and such,\r\ntoo, under most circumstances, are the employments connected with\r\nship-building.\r\n\r\nOur own experience has been a powerful, and ought to be a convincing and\r\nlong-remembered, preacher on this point. From the close of the war of\r\nthe Revolution, there came on a period of depression and distress, on\r\nthe Atlantic coast, such as the people had hardly felt during the\r\nsharpest crisis of the war itself. Ship-owners, ship-builders,\r\nmechanics, artisans, all were destitute of employment, and some of them\r\ndestitute of bread. British ships came freely, and British goods came\r\nplentifully; while to American ships and American products there was\r\nneither protection on the one side, nor the equivalent of reciprocal\r\nfree trade on the other. The cheaper labor of England supplied the\r\ninhabitants of the Atlantic shores with every thing. Ready-made clothes,\r\namong the rest, from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet,\r\nwere for sale in every city. All these things came free from any general\r\nsystem of imposts. Some of the States attempted to establish their own\r\npartial systems, but they failed. Voluntary association was resorted to,\r\nbut that failed also. A memorable instance of this mode of attempting\r\nprotection occurred in Boston. The ship-owners, seeing that British\r\nvessels came and went freely, while their own ships were rotting at the\r\nwharves, raised a committee to address the people, recommending to them,\r\nin the strongest manner, not to buy or use any articles imported in\r\nBritish ships. The chairman of this committee was no less distinguished\r\na character than the immortal John Hancock. The committee performed its\r\nduty powerfully and eloquently. It set forth strong and persuasive\r\nreasons why the people should not buy or use British goods imported in\r\nBritish ships. The ship-owners and merchants having thus proceeded, the\r\nmechanics of Boston took up the subject also. They answered the\r\nmerchants' committee. They agreed with them cordially, that British\r\ngoods, imported in British vessels, ought not to be bought or consumed;\r\nbut then they took the liberty of going a step farther, and of insisting\r\n_that such goods ought not to be bought or consumed at all_. (Great\r\napplause.) \"For,\" said they, \"Mr. Hancock, what difference does it make\r\nto us, whether hats, shoes, boots, shirts, handkerchiefs, tin-ware,\r\nbrass-ware, cutlery, and every other article, come in British ships or\r\ncome in your ships; since, in whatever ships they come, they take away\r\nour means of living?\"\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it is an historical truth, manifested in a thousand ways by\r\nthe public proceedings and public meetings of the times, that the\r\nnecessity of a general and uniform impost system, which, while it should\r\nprovide revenue to pay the public debt, and foster the commerce of the\r\ncountry, should also encourage and sustain domestic manufactures, was\r\nthe leading cause in producing the present national Constitution. No\r\nclass of persons was more zealous for the new Constitution, than the\r\nhandicraftsmen, artisans, and manufacturers. There were then, it is\r\ntrue, no large manufacturing establishments. There were no manufactories\r\nin the interior, for there were no inhabitants. Here was Fort Pitt,--it\r\nhad a place on the map,--but here were no people, or only a very few.\r\nBut in the cities and towns on the Atlantic, the full importance, indeed\r\nthe absolute necessity, of a new form of government and a general system\r\nof imposts was deeply felt.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, Gentlemen, that at that time much was thought to depend\r\non Massachusetts; several States had already agreed to the Constitution;\r\nif her convention adopted it, it was likely to go into operation. This\r\ngave to the proceedings of that convention an intense interest, and the\r\ncountry looked with trembling anxiety for the result. That result was\r\nfor a long time doubtful. The convention was known to be almost equally\r\ndivided; and down to the very day and hour of the final vote, no one\r\ncould predict, with any certainty, which side would preponderate. It was\r\nunder these circumstances, and at this crisis, that the tradesmen of the\r\ntown of Boston, in January, 1788, assembled at the Green Dragon tavern,\r\nthe place where the Whigs of the Revolution, in its early stages, had\r\nbeen accustomed to assemble. They resolved, that, in their opinion, if\r\nthe Constitution should be adopted, \"trade and navigation would revive\r\nand increase, and employ and subsistence be afforded to many of their\r\ntownsmen, then suffering for the want of the necessaries of life\"; and\r\nthat, on the other hand, should it be rejected, \"the small remains of\r\ncommerce yet left would be annihilated; the various trades and\r\nhandicrafts dependent thereon decay; the poor be increased, and many\r\nworthy and skilful mechanics compelled to seek employ and subsistence in\r\nstrange lands.\" These resolutions were carried to the Boston delegates\r\nin the convention, and placed in the hands of Samuel Adams. That great\r\nand distinguished friend of American liberty, it was feared, might have\r\ndoubts about the new Constitution. Naturally cautious and sagacious, it\r\nwas apprehended he might fear the practicability, or the safety, of a\r\ngeneral government. He received the resolutions from the hands of Paul\r\nRevere, a brass-founder by occupation, a man of sense and character, and\r\nof high public spirit, whom the mechanics of Boston ought never to\r\nforget. \"How many mechanics,\" said Mr. Adams, \"were at the Green Dragon\r\nwhen these resolutions were passed?\" \"More, Sir,\" was the reply, \"than\r\nthe Green Dragon could hold.\" \"And where were the rest, Mr. Revere?\" \"In\r\nthe streets, Sir.\" \"And how many were in the streets?\" \"More, Sir, than\r\nthere are stars in the sky.\" This is an instance only, among many, to\r\nprove, what is indisputably true, that the tradesmen and mechanics of\r\nthe country did look to the new Constitution for encouragement and\r\nprotection in their respective occupations. Under these circumstances,\r\nit is not to be expected that they will abandon the principle, in its\r\napplication to their own employments, any more than in its application\r\nto the commercial and shipping interests. They believe the power is in\r\nthe Constitution; and doubtless they mean, so far as depends on them, to\r\nkeep it there. Desirous of no extravagant measure of protection,\r\ndesirous of oppressing or burdening nobody, seeking nothing as a\r\nsubstitute for honest industry and hard work, as a part of the American\r\nfamily, having the same interests as other parts, they will continue\r\ntheir attachment to the Union and the Constitution, and to all the great\r\nand leading interests of the country.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, your worthy Mayor has alluded to the subject of internal\r\nimprovements. Having no doubt of the power of the general government\r\nover various objects comprehended under that name, I confess I have\r\nfelt great pleasure in forwarding them, to the extent of my ability, by\r\nmeans of reasonable aid from the government. It has seemed strange to\r\nme, that, in the progress of human knowledge and human virtue (for I\r\nhave no doubt that both are making progress), the efforts of government\r\nshould so long have been principally confined to external affairs, and\r\nto the enactment of the general laws, without considering how much may\r\nbe done by government, which cannot be done without it, for the\r\nimprovement of the condition of the people. There are many objects, of\r\ngreat value to man, which cannot be attained by unconnected individuals,\r\nbut must be attained, if at all, by association. For many of them\r\ngovernment seems the most natural and the most efficient association.\r\nVoluntary association has done much, but it cannot do all. To the great\r\nhonor and advantage of your own State, she has been forward in applying\r\nthe agency of government to great objects of internal utility. But even\r\nStates cannot do every thing. There are some things which belong to all\r\nthe States; and, if done at all, must be done by all the States. At the\r\nconclusion of the late war, it appeared to me that the time had come for\r\nthe government to turn its attention inward; to survey the condition of\r\nthe country, and particularly the vast Western country; to take a\r\ncomprehensive view of the whole; and to adopt a liberal system of\r\ninternal improvements. There are objects not naturally within the sphere\r\nof any one State, which yet seemed of great importance, as calculated to\r\nunite the different parts of the country, to open a better and shorter\r\nway between the producer and consumer, to promise the highest advantage\r\nto government itself, in any exigency. It is true, Gentlemen, that the\r\nlocal theatre for such improvement is not mainly in the East. The East\r\nis old, pretty fully peopled, and small. The West is new, vast, and\r\nthinly peopled. Our rivers can be measured; yours cannot. We are\r\nbounded; you are boundless. The West was, therefore, most deeply\r\ninterested in this system, though certainly not alone interested, even\r\nin such works as had a Western locality. To clear her rivers was to open\r\nthem for the commerce of the whole country; to construct harbors, and\r\nclear entrances to existing harbors, whether on the Gulf of Mexico or on\r\nthe Lakes, was for the advantage of that whole commerce. And if this\r\nwere not so, he is but a poor public man whose patriotism is governed\r\nby the cardinal points; who is for or against a proposed measure,\r\naccording to its indication by compass, or as it may happen to tend\r\nfarther from, or come nearer to, his own immediate connections. And look\r\nat the West; look at these rivers; look at the Lakes; look especially at\r\nLake Erie, and see what a moderate expenditure has done for the safety\r\nof human life, and the preservation of property, in the navigation of\r\nthat lake; and done, let me add, in the face of a fixed and ardent\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nI rejoice, sincerely, Gentlemen, in the general progress of internal\r\nimprovement, and in the completion of so many objects near you, and\r\nconnected with your prosperity. Your own canal and railroad unite you\r\nwith the Atlantic. Near you is the Ohio Canal, which does so much credit\r\nto a younger State, and with which your city will doubtless one day have\r\na direct connection. On the south and east approaches the Baltimore and\r\nOhio Railroad, a great and spirited enterprise, which I always thought\r\nentitled to the aid of government, and a branch of which, it may be\r\nhoped, will yet reach the head of the Ohio.\r\n\r\nI will only add, Gentlemen, that for what I have done in the cause of\r\ninternal improvement I claim no particular merit, having only acted with\r\nothers, and discharged, conscientiously and fairly, what I regarded as\r\nmy duty to the whole country.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, the Mayor has spoken of the importance and necessity of\r\neducation. And can any one doubt, that to man, as a social and an\r\nimmortal being, as interested in the world that is, and infinitely more\r\nconcerned for that which is to be, education, that is to say, the\r\nculture of the mind and the heart, is an object of infinite importance?\r\nSo far as we can trace the designs of Providence, the formation of the\r\nmind and character, by instruction in knowledge, and instruction in\r\nrighteousness, is a main end of human being. Among the new impulses\r\nwhich society has received, none is more gratifying than the awakened\r\nattention to public education. That object begins to exhibit itself to\r\nthe minds of men in its just magnitude, and to possess its due share of\r\nregard. It is but in a limited degree, and indirectly only, that the\r\npowers of the general government have been exercised in the promotion of\r\nthis object. So far as these powers extend, I have concurred in their\r\nexercise with great pleasure. The Western States, from the recency of\r\ntheir settlement, from the great proportion of their population which\r\nare children, and from other circumstances which must, in all new\r\ncountries, more or less curtail individual means, have appeared to me to\r\nhave peculiar claims to regard; and in all cases where I have thought\r\nthe power clear, I have most heartily concurred in measures designed for\r\ntheir benefit, in this respect. And amidst all our efforts for\r\neducation, literary, moral, or religious, be it always remembered that\r\nwe leave opinion and conscience free. Heaven grant that it may be the\r\nglory of the United States to have established two great truths, of the\r\nhighest importance to the whole human race; first, that an enlightened\r\ncommunity _is_ capable of self-government; and, second, that the\r\ntoleration of all sects does _not_ necessarily produce indifference to\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nBut I have already detained you too long. My friends, fellow-citizens,\r\nand countrymen, I take a respectful leave of you. The time I have passed\r\non this side the Alleghanies has been a succession of happy days. I have\r\nseen much to instruct and much to delight me. I return you, again and\r\nagain, my unfeigned thanks for the frankness and hospitality with which\r\nyou have made me welcome; and wherever I may go, or wherever I may be, I\r\npray you to believe I shall not lose the recollection of your kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n  [102] Address delivered to the Citizens of Pittsburg, on the 8th of\r\n        July, 1833.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEPTION AT BANGOR.[103]\r\n\r\n  During a visit to Maine, in the summer of 1835, on business\r\n  connected with his profession, Mr. Webster was at Bangor, where he\r\n  partook of a collation with many of the citizens of that place.\r\n  There were so many more people, however, desirous to see and hear\r\n  him than could be accommodated in the hall of the hotel, that, after\r\n  the cloth was removed, he was compelled to proceed to the balcony,\r\n  where, after thanking the company for their hospitality, and their\r\n  manifestation of regard, he addressed the assembly as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving occasion to come into the State on professional business, I have\r\ngladly availed myself of the opportunity to visit this city, the growing\r\nmagnitude and importance of which have recently attracted such general\r\nnotice. I am happy to say, that I see around me ample proofs of the\r\ncorrectness of the favorable representations which have gone abroad.\r\nYour city, Gentlemen, has certainly experienced an extraordinary growth;\r\nand it is a growth, I think, which there is reason to hope is not\r\nunnatural, or greatly disproportionate to the eminent advantages of the\r\nplace. It so happened, that, at an early period of my life, I came to\r\nthis spot, attracted by that favorable position, which the slightest\r\nglance on the map must satisfy every one that it occupies. It is near\r\nthe head of tide-water, on a river which brings to it from the sea a\r\nvolume of water equal to the demands of the largest vessels of war, and\r\nwhose branches, uniting here, from great distances above, traverse in\r\ntheir course extensive tracts now covered with valuable productions of\r\nthe forest, and capable, most of them, of profitable agricultural\r\ncultivation. But at the period I speak of, the time had not come for\r\nthe proper development and display of these advantages. Neither the\r\nplace itself, nor the country, was then ready. A long course of\r\ncommercial restrictions and embargo, and a foreign war, were yet to be\r\ngone through, before the local advantages of such a spot could be\r\nexhibited or enjoyed, or the country would be in a condition to create\r\nan active demand for its main products.\r\n\r\nI believe some twelve or twenty houses were all that Bangor could\r\nenumerate, when I was in it before; and I remember to have crossed the\r\nstream which now divides your fair city on some floating logs, for the\r\npurpose of visiting a former friend and neighbor, who had just then\r\nsettled here; a gentleman always most respectable, and now venerable for\r\nhis age and his character, whom I have great pleasure in seeing among\r\nyou to-day, in the enjoyment of health and happiness.\r\n\r\nIt is quite obvious, Gentlemen, that while the local advantages of a\r\nnoble river, and of a large surrounding country, may be justly\r\nconsidered as the original spring of the present prosperity of the city,\r\nthe current of this prosperity has, nevertheless, been put in motion,\r\nenlarged, and impelled, by the general progress of improvement, and\r\ngrowth of wealth throughout the whole country.\r\n\r\nAt the period of my former visit, there was, of course, neither\r\nrailroad, nor steamboat, nor canal, to favor communication; nor do I\r\nrecollect that any public or stage coach came within fifty miles of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nInternal improvement (as it is comprehensively called in this country)\r\nhas been the great agent of this favorable change; and so blended are\r\nour interests, that the general activity which exists elsewhere,\r\nsupported and stimulated by internal improvement, pervades and benefits\r\neven those portions of the country which are locally remote from the\r\nimmediate scene of the main operations of this improvement. Whatever\r\npromotes communication, whatsoever extends general business, whatsoever\r\nencourages enterprise, or whatsoever advances the general wealth and\r\nprosperity of other States, must have a plain, direct, and powerful\r\nbearing on your own prosperity. In truth, there is no town in the Union,\r\nwhose hopes can be more directly staked on the general prosperity of the\r\ncountry, than this rising city. If any thing should interrupt the\r\ngeneral operations of business, if commercial embarrassment, foreign\r\nwar, pecuniary derangement, domestic dissension, or any other causes,\r\nwere to arrest the general progress of the public welfare, all must see\r\nwith what a blasting and withering effect such a course must operate on\r\nBangor.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have often taken occasion to say, what circumstances may\r\nrender it proper now to repeat, that, at the close of the last war, a\r\nnew era, in my judgment, had opened in the United States. A new career\r\nthen lay before us. At peace ourselves with the nations of Europe, and\r\nthose nations, too, at peace with one another, and the leading civilized\r\nstates of the world no longer allowing that carrying trade which had\r\nbeen the rich harvest of our neutrality in the midst of former wars, but\r\nall now coming forward to exercise their own rights, in sharing the\r\ncommerce and navigation of the world, it seemed to me to be very plain,\r\nthat, while our commerce was still to be fostered with the most zealous\r\ncare, yet quite a new view of things was presented to us in regard to\r\nour internal pursuits and concerns. The works of peace, as it seemed to\r\nme, had become our duties. A hostile exterior, a front of brass, and an\r\narm of iron, all necessary in the just defence of the country against\r\nforeign aggression, naturally gave place, in a change of circumstances,\r\nto the attitude, the objects, and the pursuits of peace. Our true\r\ninterest, as I thought, was to explore our own resources, to call forth\r\nand encourage labor and enterprise upon internal objects, to multiply\r\nthe sources of employment and comfort at home, and to unite the country\r\nby ties of intercourse, commerce, benefits, and prosperity, in all\r\nparts, as well as by the ties of political association. And it appeared\r\nto me that government itself clearly possessed the power, and was as\r\nclearly charged with the duty of helping on, in various ways, this great\r\nbusiness of internal improvement. I have, therefore, steadily supported\r\nall measures directed to that end, which appeared to me to be within the\r\njust power of the government, and to be practicable within the limits of\r\nreasonable expenditure. And if any one would judge how far the fostering\r\nof this spirit has been beneficial to the country, let him compare its\r\nstate at this moment with its condition at the commencement of the late\r\nwar; and let him then say how much of all that has been added to\r\nnational wealth and national strength, and to individual prosperity and\r\nhappiness, has been the fair result of internal improvement.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it has been your pleasure to give utterance to sentiments\r\nexpressing approbation of my humble efforts, on several occasions, in\r\ndefence and maintenance of the Constitution of the country. I have\r\nnothing to say of those efforts, except that they have been honestly\r\nintended. The country sees no reason, I trust, to suppose that on those\r\noccasions I have taken counsel of any thing but a deep sense of duty. I\r\nhave, on some occasions, felt myself called on to maintain my opinions,\r\nin opposition to power, to place, to official influence, and to\r\noverwhelming personal popularity. I have thought it my imperative duty\r\nto put forth my most earnest efforts to maintain what I considered to be\r\nthe just powers of the government, when it appeared to me that those to\r\nwhom its administration was intrusted were countenancing doctrines\r\ninevitably tending to its destruction. And I have, with far more\r\npleasure, on other occasions, supported the constituted authorities,\r\nwhen I have deemed their measures to be called for by a regard to its\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States, Gentlemen, has appeared to me to\r\nhave been formed and adopted for two grand objects. The first is the\r\nUnion of the States. It is the bond of that union, and it states and\r\ndefines its terms. Who can speak in terms warm enough and high enough of\r\nits importance in this respect, or the admirable wisdom with which it is\r\nformed? Or who, when he shall have stated the benefits and blessings\r\nwhich it has conferred upon the States most strongly, will venture to\r\nsay that he has done it justice? For one, I am not sanguine enough to\r\nbelieve that, if this bond of union were dissolved, any other tie\r\nuniting all the States would take its place for generations to come. It\r\nrequires no common skill, it is no piece of ordinary political\r\njourney-work, to form a system which shall hold together four-and-twenty\r\nseparate State sovereignties, the line of whose united territories runs\r\ndown all the parallels of latitude from New Brunswick to the Gulf of\r\nMexico, and whose connected breadth stretches from the sea far beyond\r\nthe Mississippi. Nor are all times or all occasions suited to such great\r\noperations. It is only under the most favorable circumstances, and only\r\nwhen great men are called on to meet great exigencies, only once in\r\ncenturies, that such fortunate political results are to be attained.\r\nWhoever, therefore, undervalues this National Union, whoever depreciates\r\nit, whoever accustoms himself to consider how the people might get on\r\nwithout it, appears to me to encourage sentiments subversive of the\r\nfoundations of our prosperity.\r\n\r\nIt is true that these twenty-four States are, more or less, different in\r\nclimate, productions, and local pursuits. There are planting States,\r\ngrain-growing States, manufacturing States, and commercial States.\r\nBut those several interests, if not identical, are not therefore\r\ninconsistent and hostile. Far from it. They unite, on the contrary, to\r\npromote an aggregate result of unrivalled national happiness. It is\r\nnot precisely a case in which\r\n\r\n  \"All nature's difference keeps all nature's peace\";\r\n\r\nbut it is a case in which variety of climate and condition, and\r\ndiversities of pursuits and productions, all unite to exhibit one\r\nharmonious, grand, and magnificent whole, to which the world may be\r\nproudly challenged to show an equal. In my opinion, no man, in any\r\ncorner of any one of these States, can stand up and declare, that he is\r\nless prosperous or less happy than if the general government had never\r\nexisted. Entertaining these sentiments, and feeling their force most\r\ndeeply, I regard it as the bounden duty of every good citizen, in public\r\nand in private life, to follow the admonition of Washington, and to\r\ncherish that Union which makes us one people. I most earnestly\r\ndeprecate, therefore, whatever occurs, in the government or out of it,\r\ncalculated to endanger the Union or disturb the basis on which it\r\nrests.\r\n\r\nAnother object of the Constitution I take to be such as is common to all\r\nwritten constitutions of free governments; that is, to fix limits to\r\ndelegated authority, or, in other words, to impose constitutional\r\nrestraints on political power. Some, who esteem themselves republicans,\r\nseem to think no other security for public liberty necessary than a\r\nprovision for a popular choice of rulers. If political power be\r\ndelegated power, they entertain little fear of its being abused. The\r\npeople's servants and favorites, they think, may be safely trusted. Our\r\nfathers, certainly, were not of this school. They sought to make\r\nassurance doubly sure, by providing, in the first place, for the\r\nelection of political agents by the people themselves, at short\r\nintervals, and, in the next place, by prescribing constitutional\r\nrestraints on all branches of this delegated authority. It is not among\r\nthe circumstances of the times most ominous for good, that a diminished\r\nestimate appears to be placed on those constitutional securities. A\r\ndisposition is but too prevalent to substitute personal confidence for\r\nlegal restraint; to put trust in men rather than in principles; and this\r\ndisposition being strongest, as it most obviously is, whenever party\r\nspirit prevails to the greatest extent, it is not without reason that\r\nfears are entertained of the existence of a spirit tending strongly to\r\nan unlimited, if it be but an elective, government.\r\n\r\nSurely, Gentlemen, this government can go through no such change. Long\r\nbefore that change could take place, the Constitution would be shattered\r\nto pieces, and the Union of the States become matter of past history. To\r\nthe Union, therefore, as well as to civil liberty, to every interest\r\nwhich we enjoy and value, to all that makes us proud of our country, or\r\nwhich renders our country lovely in our own eyes, or dear to our own\r\nhearts, nothing can be more repugnant, nothing more hostile, nothing\r\nmore directly destructive, than excessive, unlimited, unconstitutional\r\nconfidence in men; nothing worse, than the doctrine that official agents\r\nmay interpret the public will in their own way, in defiance of the\r\nConstitution and the laws; or that they may set up any thing for the\r\ndeclaration of that will except the Constitution and the laws\r\nthemselves; or that any public officer, high or low, should undertake to\r\nconstitute himself or to call himself _the representative of the\r\npeople_, except so far as the Constitution and the laws create and\r\ndenominate him such representative. There is no usurpation so dangerous\r\nas that which comes in the borrowed name of the people. If from some\r\nother authority, or other source, prerogatives be attempted to be\r\nenforced upon the people, they naturally oppose and resist it. It is an\r\nopen enemy, and they can easily subdue it. But that which professes to\r\nact in their own name, and by their own authority, that which calls\r\nitself their servant, although it exercises their power without legal\r\nright or constitutional sanction, requires something more of vigilance\r\nto detect, and something more of stern patriotism to repress; and if it\r\nbe not seasonably both detected and repressed, then the republic is\r\nalready in the downward path of those which have gone before it.\r\n\r\nI hold, therefore, Gentlemen, that a strict submission, by every\r\nbranch of the government, to the limitations and restraints of the\r\nConstitution, is of the very essence of all security for the\r\npreservation of liberty; and that no one can be a true and intelligent\r\nfriend of that liberty, who will consent that any man in public station,\r\nwhatever he may think of the honesty of his motives, shall assume to\r\nexercise an authority above the Constitution and the laws. Whatever\r\ngovernment is not a government of laws, is a despotism, let it be\r\ncalled what it may.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, on an occasion like this, I ought not to detain you longer.\r\nLet us hope for the best, in behalf of this great and happy country,\r\nand of our glorious Constitution. Indeed, Gentlemen, we may well\r\ncongratulate ourselves that the country is so young, so fresh, and so\r\nvigorous, that it can bear a great deal of bad government. It can take\r\nan enormous load of official mismanagement on its shoulders, and yet go\r\nahead. Like the vessel impelled by steam, it can move forward, not\r\nonly without other than the ordinary means, but even when those means\r\noppose it; it can make its way in defiance of the elements, and\r\n\r\n  \"Against the wind, against the tide,\r\n  Still steady, with an upright keel.\"\r\n\r\nThere are some things, however, which the country cannot stand. It\r\ncannot stand any shock of civil liberty, or any disruption of the Union.\r\nShould either of these happen, the vessel of the state will have no\r\nlonger either steerage or motion. She will lie on the billows helpless\r\nand hopeless, the scorn and contempt of all the enemies of free\r\ninstitutions, and an object of indescribable grief to all their\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n  [103] Remarks made to the Citizens of Bangor, Maine, on the 25th of\r\n        August, 1835.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENTATION OF A VASE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A large number of the citizens of Boston being desirous to offer\r\n  to Mr. Webster some enduring testimony of their gratitude for his\r\n  services in Congress, and more especially for his defence of the\r\n  Constitution during the crisis of Nullification, a committee was\r\n  raised, in the spring of 1835, to procure a piece of plate which\r\n  should be worthy of such an object. By their direction, and more\r\n  particularly under the superintendence of one of their number,\r\n  the late Mr. George W. Brimmer, to whose taste and skill the\r\n  committee were deeply indebted for the selection of the model and\r\n  the arrangement of the devices, the beautiful vase, now well\r\n  known throughout the country as the WEBSTER VASE, was prepared\r\n  at the manufactory of Messrs. Jones, Lows, & Ball, in Boston.\r\n  After it was finished, the committee found it impossible to\r\n  withstand the wish, both of the numerous subscribers and of the\r\n  public generally, to witness the ceremonies and hear the remarks by\r\n  which its presentation might be accompanied. It was accordingly\r\n  presented to Mr. Webster in the presence of three or four\r\n  thousand spectators, assembled at the Odeon, on the evening of\r\n  the 12th of October. The Vase was placed on a pedestal covered with\r\n  the American flag, and contained on its front the following\r\n  inscription:--\r\n\r\n               PRESENTED TO\r\n              DANIEL WEBSTER\r\n      THE DEFENDER OF THE CONSTITUTION,\r\n        BY THE CITIZENS OF BOSTON,\r\n              Oct. 12, 1835.\r\n\r\n  The chairman of the committee (Mr. Z. Jellison) opened the meeting\r\n  with the following remarks:--\r\n\r\n\"Fellow-Citizens:--The friends of the Hon. Daniel Webster in this city,\r\nconceiving the propriety of giving that gentleman an expression of the\r\nhigh estimation in which they hold his public services, and wishing\r\nalso to tender him a testimonial of their regard for his moral worth and\r\nsocial virtues, called a meeting of consultation on the subject, some\r\nmonths since, at which a committee was appointed, with instructions to\r\nprocure a suitable piece of plate, to be presented to him in their\r\nbehalf, before his official duty should again require his departure\r\nhence for the seat of government. In obedience to their instructions,\r\nthat committee have procured, from the hands of the most skilful artists\r\nin this country, the piece of plate I now have the honor to exhibit to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\"They have now called their constituents together, for the purpose of\r\npresenting this Vase in their presence. Had the committee consulted the\r\nwishes only of the gentleman for whom it is intended, this presentation\r\nmight, perhaps, have taken place in a more private or less imposing\r\nmanner; but, in the course they have adopted, they have been governed by\r\nthe wishes of the citizens at large. They now respectfully ask your kind\r\nindulgence while they proceed in the discharge of this part of their\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n\"The committee have appointed, as their organ of communication, the Hon.\r\nFrancis C. Gray, with whom I now have the pleasure to leave the\r\nsubject.\"\r\n\r\n  Mr. GRAY then rose, and spoke as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Webster:--By direction of the committee, and in behalf of your\r\nfellow-citizens, who have caused this Vase to be made, I now request\r\nyour acceptance of it. They offer it in token of their high sense of\r\nyour public character and services. But on these it were not becoming to\r\ndwell in addressing yourself. Nor is a regard for these the only, or the\r\nprincipal, motive of those for whom I speak. They offer it mainly to\r\nevince the high estimation in which they hold the political sentiments\r\nand principles which you have professed and maintained. There may\r\nundoubtedly be differences of opinion among them with regard to this or\r\nthat particular measure; and a blind, indiscriminate, wholesale adhesion\r\nto the life and opinions of any one would not be worth offering, nor\r\nworth accepting, among freemen. We are not man-worshippers here in\r\nMassachusetts. But the great political principles, the leading views of\r\npolicy, which you have been forward to assert and vindicate, these they\r\nall unite to honor; and in rendering public homage to these, they feel\r\nthat they are not so much paying a compliment to you, as performing a\r\nduty to their country.\r\n\r\n\"In a free republic, where all men exercise political power, the\r\nprevalence of correct views and principles on political subjects is\r\nessential to the safety of the state. It is not enough that their truth\r\nshould be recognized. Their operation and tendency must be understood\r\nand appreciated; they must be made familiar to the mass of the\r\npeople, become closely interwoven with their whole habits of thought\r\nand feeling, objects of attachment to which they may cling instantly and\r\ninstinctively in all time of doubt or peril, so as not to be swept away\r\nby any sudden flood of prejudice or passion. Hence it is the duty of\r\nevery man to embrace all fit occasions, nay, to seek fit occasions, for\r\ndeclaring his adherence to such principles, and giving them the\r\nsupport of his influence, however high or however humble that influence\r\nmay be. There is no justice, therefore, in the complaint often made\r\nagainst the members of our legislative assemblies, that they sometimes\r\nspeak not for their audience merely, but for their constituents;\r\nseeking not simply to affect the decision of the question then\r\npending, but to influence the public sentiment with regard to the\r\nprinciples involved in it. This affords no ground of censure against\r\nthem, so they speak well and wisely. The practice may be abused, no\r\ndoubt; but, in itself, it is a natural, inevitable right. So it should\r\nbe in relation to all important principles in a free country.\r\nNothing else but the excitement, kindled by the conflict of debate,\r\nwill ever make those great principles subjects of general attention\r\nand interest. Nothing else but the observation of their application in\r\npractice can make them generally understood and appreciated. We all\r\nrecollect questions (and among them that on Mr. Foot's resolutions,\r\nnot likely soon to be forgotten), the vote on which was as certainly\r\nknown before the discussion as after it, and known to be unalterable\r\nby any argument or persuasion; and yet the discussion of which was\r\nso far from being uninteresting and unprofitable, that it was echoed\r\nand reechoed through the land, making a deep and lasting impression\r\non the public mind, establishing incontrovertibly vital principles\r\nbefore disputed, and thus giving new strength and stability to our\r\nfree institutions, and forming, I may almost say, an epoch in our\r\npolitical history.\r\n\r\n\"On this and similar occasions, not to dwell on your steadfast\r\nadherence to those more general principles of civil liberty, which are\r\nequally important in every age and country,--on such occasions the\r\nfundamental principles peculiar to our system of government have always\r\nhad in you a decided advocate, ever ready to develop and illustrate\r\ntheir nature and operation, and to enforce the obligations which they\r\nimpose. Among the most prominent peculiarities of our system is the fact\r\nthat the United States are not a confederacy of independent sovereigns,\r\nthe subjects of each of whom are responsible to him alone for their\r\ncompliance with the obligations of the compact, but that, for certain\r\nspecified purposes, they form one nation, every citizen of which is\r\nresponsible, directly, immediately, exclusively, to the whole nation for\r\nthe performance of his duties to the whole; that the Constitution is not\r\na treaty, nor any thing like a treaty, but a frame of government,\r\nresting on the same foundations, and supported by the same sanctions,\r\nas any other government, to be subverted only by the same means, by\r\nrevolution,--revolution to be brought about by the same authority which\r\nwould warrant a revolution in any government, and by none other,--to be\r\njustified, when justifiable, by the same paramount necessity, and by\r\nnothing less. This government is not the government of the States, but\r\nthat of the people; and it behooves the people, every one of the\r\npeople, to do his utmost to preserve it; not in form merely, but in\r\nits full efficiency, as a practical system; to maintain the Union as it\r\nis, in all its integrity,--the Constitution as it is, in all its\r\npurity, and in all its strength; and when they are in danger, to hasten\r\nto their support promptly, frankly, fearlessly, undeterred, and\r\nunencumbered by any political combination, let who will be his\r\ncompanions in the good cause, and let who will hang back from it.\r\n\r\n\"The other great peculiarity of our political system--and on these two\r\nhang all the liberty and hopes of America--is this: that the supreme\r\npower or sovereignty is divided between the State and national\r\ngovernments, and the portion allotted to each distributed--among\r\nseveral independent departments; and this, notwithstanding the maxim of\r\nEuropean politicians, too hastily adopted by some of our own statesmen,\r\nthat sovereignty is, in its nature, indivisible. By sovereignty, I do\r\nnot mean, and they do not mean, the ultimate right of the people to\r\nestablish and subvert governments, the right of revolution, as it has\r\nbeen called; for, thus understood, it would be absurd to inquire, as\r\nthey constantly do, where the sovereignty resides in any particular\r\ngovernment, since this ultimate sovereignty never can reside anywhere\r\nbut in the people themselves. It is inherent in them and inalienable,\r\nexisting equally as a right, however its exercise may be impeded, in\r\nfree and despotic governments. But by sovereignty must be understood the\r\nsupreme power of the government, the highest power which can lawfully be\r\nexercised by any constituted authority. Now, let the politicians of\r\nEurope say what they will of the indivisibility of this power, we know\r\nthat, among us, it is in point of fact divided; that in relation to some\r\nobjects, the supreme power is in the national government, subject to no\r\nearthly control but that of the people, exercising their right of\r\nrevolution; and that in relation to others, it is in the State\r\ngovernments, subject to the same and to no other control; and that in\r\neach of these governments the power conferred is divided among the\r\nlegislative, executive, and judicial departments, each of which is\r\nentirely independent in the performance of its appropriate duties.\r\n\r\n\"This system of practical cheeks and balances, altogether peculiar\r\nto us, is designed to operate, and does operate, for the restraint of\r\npower and the protection of liberty. But, like every earthly good, it\r\nbrings with it its attendant evil in the danger of encroachment and\r\ncollision. To guard against these dangers is one of the most important,\r\nmost difficult, most delicate of our public duties; to see that the\r\nnational government shall not encroach upon the power of the States,\r\nnor the States on that of the nation; that no State shall interfere\r\nwith the domestic legislation of another, nor lightly nor unjustly\r\nsuspect another of seeking to interfere with its own; but that each of\r\nthese several governments, and every department in each, shall be\r\nstrictly confined to its proper sphere; that no one shall evade any\r\nresponsibility which is imposed on him by the Constitution and the laws,\r\nand no one assume any responsibility which is not so.\r\n\r\n\"But by what power can this be accomplished? There is only one. Physical\r\nforce will not do it. The system of our government has been compared to\r\nthat of the heavenly bodies, which move on, orb within orb cycle within\r\ncycle, in apparent confusion, but in real, uninterrupted, unalterable\r\nharmony. And the harmony of our system can only be maintained by a\r\npower, which, like that regulating their movements, is unseen, unfelt,\r\nyet irresistible,--_Public Opinion_.\r\n\r\n\"This is the precise circumstance which renders the prevalence of just\r\npolitical views and principles peculiarly important among us, and\r\nsecures to him, who labors faithfully and successfully to promote their\r\ndiffusion, the praise of having deserved well of his country.\r\n\r\n\"The opinions of men, however, are invariably and inevitably affected\r\nby their interests and their feelings. This consideration opens a wide\r\nfield of duty to the American statesman, requiring him to prevent,\r\nby every means in his power, all collisions of interest and all\r\nexasperations of feeling; to correct and rebuke the misrepresentations\r\nwhich tend to array one part of the country against another, or one\r\nportion of society against another, as if their interests were adverse,\r\nwhereas in truth they are one; and, avoiding the paltry cunning which\r\nplays off the different parts of the country against each other,\r\nsacrificing the interests of the whole to this part to-day, on\r\ncondition that they shall be sacrificed to another to-morrow, by\r\nwhich means they are always sacrificed, to be governed by that\r\nliberal, enlightened, far-sighted policy, which in all questions of\r\nexpediency looks invariably and exclusively to the permanent interests\r\nof the whole nation, considered as one,--which aims to impress on the\r\nminds and the hearts of this people, deeply, indelibly, the great\r\ntruth, that the prosperity and the glory of the United States, their\r\nimprovement and happiness at home, their rank among the nations of\r\nthe earth, must be proportioned to the strength and cordiality of their\r\nunion, and can only be carried to their highest pitch by the universal\r\nconviction, the deep-seated and overruling sentiment, that, for the\r\npurposes set forth in the Constitution, we are one people, one and\r\nindivisible; and that for us to break the bond that makes us one, and\r\nresolve this glorious Union into its original elements, would be as\r\nmad and as fatal as for England to go back again to her Heptarchy.\r\n\r\n\"The statesman who is governed by these principles and this policy,\r\nwhose great object is not to win the spoils of victory, nor even its\r\nlaurels, but to fight the good fight and render faithful service to his\r\ncountry, will never want opportunity to merit the public gratitude,\r\nwhatever may be his political position. If in the majority, considering\r\nthat the duration of any administration is only a day in the existence\r\nof the government, and yet a day which must affect all that are to\r\nfollow it, he will never be tempted to swerve from these great\r\nprinciples by any temporary advantage, even to the whole community,\r\nstill less by any local or partial benefit, and least of all by any\r\nparty or personal consideration. He will not make it the chief object of\r\ngovernment to extend and perpetuate the power of his party. He will not\r\nregard his political opponents as enemies, over whom he has triumphed\r\nand whom he is to despoil. He will not seek to throw off or evade the\r\nrestraints imposed by the Constitution on all power, nor will he bestow\r\npublic offices as the reward or the motive for adherence to his party or\r\nhis person. If in the minority, he will find inducement enough and\r\nreward enough for the most strenuous exertion, in the conviction, that\r\nan intelligent, resolute, vigilant minority is not utterly powerless in\r\nour government, but may often control, modify, or even arrest the most\r\npernicious schemes of reckless rulers, and diminish, if not prevent, the\r\nevils of misrule. He will consider also, that in political science, as\r\nin the other moral sciences, truth must always force its way slowly\r\nagainst general opposition, and that although the great principles for\r\nwhich he contends should not triumph in the debate of the day, they may\r\nyet, if ably sustained, ultimately triumph in the hearts of the people,\r\nand come at last to rule the land; and that thenceforward, so long as\r\ntheir beneficent influence shall endure, so long as they shall be\r\nremembered upon earth, so long will his name and his praise endure who\r\nshall have watched over them in their weakness, and struggled for them\r\nin their adversity.\r\n\r\n\"But I must not be tempted beyond the tone which befits the part\r\nassigned me, which is simply to state the motives and feelings of those\r\nfor whom I speak on this occasion; and I am sure, Gentlemen, that I am\r\nthe faithful interpreter of your sentiments, when I say, that it is from\r\nattachment to the great principles of civil liberty and constitutional\r\ngovernment, that you offer this token of respect to one who has always\r\nmaintained them and been governed by them; to one whom this people,\r\nbecause he has been guided by those principles, and for the sake of\r\nthose principles, delight to honor; whom they honor with their\r\nconfidence, whom they honor by cherishing the memory of his past\r\nservices, and by their best hopes and wishes for the future, and whom\r\nthey will honor, let who else may shrink and falter, by their cordial\r\nefforts to raise him to that high station for which so many patriotic\r\ncitizens, in various parts of the country, are now holding him up as a\r\ncandidate; and they will do this on the full conviction, that he will\r\nalways be true to those principles, wherever his country may call him.\"\r\n\r\n  To this address Mr. WEBSTER made the following reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENTATION OF A VASE.[104]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN:--I accept, with grateful respect, the\r\npresent which it is your pleasure to make. I value it. It bears an\r\nexpression of your regard for those political principles which I have\r\nendeavored to maintain; and though the material were less costly, or the\r\nworkmanship less elegant, any durable evidence of your approbation could\r\nnot but give me high satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThis approbation is the more gratifying, as it is not bestowed for\r\nservices connected with local questions, or local interests, or which\r\nare supposed to have been peculiarly beneficial to yourselves, but for\r\nefforts which had the interests of the whole country for their object,\r\nand which were useful, if useful at all, to all who live under the\r\nblessings of the Constitution and government of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is twelve or thirteen years, Gentlemen, since I was honored with a\r\nseat in Congress, by the choice of the citizens of Boston. They saw fit\r\nto repeat that choice more than once; and I embrace, with pleasure, this\r\nopportunity of expressing to them my sincere and profound sense of\r\nobligation for these manifestations of confidence. At a later period,\r\nthe Legislature of the State saw fit to transfer me to another\r\nplace;[105] and have again renewed the trust, under circumstances which\r\nI have felt to impose upon me new obligations of duty, and an increased\r\ndevotion to the political welfare of the country. These twelve or\r\nthirteen years, Gentlemen, have been years of labor, and not without\r\nsacrifices; but both have been more than compensated by the kindness,\r\nthe good-will, and the favorable interpretation with which my discharge\r\nof official duties has been received. In this changing world, we can\r\nhardly say that we possess what is present, and the future is all\r\nunknown. But the past is ours. Its acquisitions, and its enjoyments, are\r\nsafe. And among these acquisitions, among the treasures of the past most\r\nto be cherished and preserved, I shall ever reckon the proofs of esteem\r\nand confidence which I have received from the citizens of Boston and the\r\nLegislature of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIn one respect, Gentlemen, your present oppresses me. It overcomes me by\r\nits tone of commendation. It assigns to me a character of which I feel I\r\nam not worthy. \"The Defender of the Constitution\" is a title quite too\r\nhigh for me. He who shall prove himself the ablest among the able men of\r\nthe country, he who shall serve it longest among those who may serve it\r\nlong, he on whose labors all the stars of benignant fortune shall shed\r\ntheir selectest influence, will have praise enough, and reward enough,\r\nif, at the end of his political and earthly career, though that career\r\nmay have been as bright as the track of the sun across the sky, the\r\nmarble under which he sleeps, and that much better record, the grateful\r\nbreasts of his living countrymen, shall pronounce him \"the Defender of\r\nthe Constitution.\" It is enough for me, Gentlemen, to be connected, in\r\nthe most humble manner, with the defence and maintenance of this great\r\nwonder of modern times, and this certain wonder of all future times. It\r\nis enough for me to stand in the ranks, and only to be counted as one of\r\nits defenders.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States, I am confident, will protect the\r\nname and the memory both of its founders and of its friends, even of its\r\nhumblest friends. It will impart to both something of its own ever\r\nmemorable and enduring distinction; I had almost said, something of its\r\nown everlasting remembrance. Centuries hence, when the vicissitudes of\r\nhuman affairs shall have broken it, if ever they shall break it, into\r\nfragments, these very fragments, every shattered column, every displaced\r\nfoundation-stone, shall yet be sure to bring them all into recollection,\r\nand attract to them the respect and gratitude of mankind.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it is to pay respect to this Constitution, it is to manifest\r\nyour attachment to it, your sense of its value, and your devotion to\r\nits true principles, that you have sought this occasion. It is not to\r\npay an ostentatious personal compliment. If it were, it would be\r\nunworthy both of you and of me. It is not to manifest attachment to\r\nindividuals, independent of all considerations of principles; if it\r\nwere, I should feel it my duty to tell you, friends as you are, that you\r\nwere doing that which, at this very moment, constitutes one of the most\r\nthreatening dangers to the Constitution itself. Your gift would have no\r\nvalue in my eyes, this occasion would be regarded by me as an idle\r\npageant, if I did not know that they are both but modes, chosen by you,\r\nto signify your attachment to the true principles of the Constitution;\r\nyour fixed purpose, so far as in you lies, to maintain those principles;\r\nand your resolution to support public men, and stand by them, so long as\r\nthey shall support and stand by the Constitution of the country, and no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\"The Constitution of the country!\" Gentlemen, often as I am called to\r\ncontemplate this subject, its importance always rises, and magnifies\r\nitself more and more, before me. I cannot view its preservation as a\r\nconcern of narrow extent, or temporary duration. On the contrary, I see\r\nin it a vast interest, which is to run down with the generations of men,\r\nand to spread over a great portion of the earth with a direct, and over\r\nthe rest with an indirect, but a most powerful influence. When I speak\r\nof it here, in this thick crowd of fellow-citizens and friends, I yet\r\nbehold, thronging about me, a much larger and more imposing crowd. I see\r\na united rush of the present and the future. I see all the patriotic of\r\nour own land, and our own time. I see also the many millions of their\r\nposterity, and I see, too, the lovers of human liberty from every part\r\nof the earth, from beneath the oppressions of thrones, and hierarchies,\r\nand dynasties, from amidst the darkness of ignorance, degradation, and\r\ndespotism, into which any ray of political light has penetrated; I see\r\nall those countless multitudes gather about us, and I hear their united\r\nand earnest voices, conjuring us, in whose charge the treasure now is,\r\nto hold on, and hold on to the last, by that which is our own highest\r\nenjoyment and their best hope.\r\n\r\nFilled with these sentiments, Gentlemen, and having through my political\r\nlife hitherto always acted under the deepest conviction of their truth\r\nand importance, it is natural that I should have regarded the\r\npreservation of the Constitution as the first great political object to\r\nbe secured. But I claim no exclusive merit. I should deem it,\r\nespecially, both unbecoming and unjust in me to separate myself, in this\r\nrespect, from other public servants of the people of Massachusetts. The\r\ndistinguished gentlemen who have preceded and followed me in the\r\nrepresentation of the city, their associates from other districts of the\r\nState, and my late worthy and most highly esteemed colleague, are\r\nentitled, one and all, to a full share in the public approbation. If\r\naccidental circumstances, or a particular position, have sometimes\r\nrendered me more prominent, equal patriotism and equal zeal have yet\r\nmade them equally deserving. It were invidious to enumerate these\r\nfellow-laborers, or to discriminate among them. Long may they live! and\r\nI could hardly express a better wish for the interest and honor of the\r\nStates, than that the public men who may follow them may be as\r\ndisinterested, as patriotic, and as able as they have proved\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThere have been, Gentlemen, it is true, anxious moments. That was an\r\nanxious occasion, to which the gentleman who has addressed me in your\r\nbehalf has alluded; I mean the debate in January, 1830. It seemed to me\r\nthen that the Constitution was about to be abandoned. Threatened with\r\nmost serious dangers, it was not only not defended, but attacked, as I\r\nthought, and weakened and wounded in its vital powers and faculties, by\r\nthose to whom the country naturally looks for its defence and\r\nprotection. It appeared to me that the Union was about to go to pieces,\r\nbefore the people were at all aware of the extent of the danger. The\r\noccasion was not sought, but forced upon us; it seemed to me momentous,\r\nand I confess that I felt that even the little that I could do, in such\r\na crisis, was called for by every motive which could be addressed to a\r\nlover of the Constitution. I took a part in the debate, therefore, with\r\nmy whole heart already in the subject, and careless for every thing in\r\nthe result, except the judgment which the people of the United States\r\nshould form upon the questions involved in the discussion. I believe\r\nthat judgment has been definitely pronounced; but nothing is due to me,\r\nbeyond the merit of having made an earnest effort to present the true\r\nquestion to the people, and to invoke for it that attention from them,\r\nwhich its high importance appeared to me to demand.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States, Gentlemen, is of a peculiar\r\nstructure. Our whole system is peculiar. It is fashioned according to\r\nno existing model, likened to no precedent, and yet founded on\r\nprinciples which lie at the foundations of all free governments,\r\nwherever such governments exist. It is a complicated system. It is\r\nelaborate, and in some sense artificial, in its composition. We have\r\ntwenty-four State sovereignties, all exercising legislative, judicial,\r\nand executive powers. Some of the sovereignties, or States, had long\r\nexisted, and, subject only to the restraint of the power of the parent\r\ncountry, had been accustomed to the forms and to the exercise of the\r\npowers of representative republics. Others of them are new creations,\r\ncoming into existence only under the Constitution itself; but all now\r\nstanding on an equal footing.\r\n\r\nThe general government, under which all these States are united, is not,\r\nas has been justly remarked by Mr. Gray, a confederation. It is much\r\nmore than a confederation. It is a popular representative government,\r\nwith all the departments, and all the functions and organs, of such a\r\ngovernment. But it is still a limited, a restrained, a severely-guarded\r\ngovernment. It exists under a written constitution, and all that human\r\nwisdom could do is done, to define its powers and to prevent their\r\nabuse. It is placed in what was supposed to be the safest medium between\r\ndangerous authority on the one hand, and debility and inefficiency on\r\nthe other. I think that happy medium was found, by the exercise of the\r\ngreatest political sagacity, and the influence of the highest good\r\nfortune. We cannot move the system either way, without the probability\r\nof hurtful change; and as experience has taught us its safety, and its\r\nusefulness, when left where it is, our duty is a plain one.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that a system thus complicated must be accompanied\r\nby more or less of danger, in every stage of its existence. It has not\r\nthe simplicity of despotism. It is not a plain column, that stands\r\nself-poised and self-supported. Nor is it a loose, irregular, unfixed,\r\nand undefined system of rule, which admits of constant and violent\r\nchanges, without losing its character. But it is a balanced and guarded\r\nsystem; a system of checks and controls; a system in which powers are\r\ncarefully delegated, and as carefully limited; a system in which the\r\nsymmetry of the parts is designed to produce an aggregate whole, which\r\nshall be favorable to personal liberty, favorable to public prosperity,\r\nand favorable to national glory. And who can deny, that, by a trial of\r\nfifty years, this American system of government has proved itself\r\ncapable of conferring all these blessings? These years have been years\r\nof great agitation throughout the civilized world. In the course of them\r\nthe face of Europe has been completely changed. Old and corrupt\r\ngovernments have been destroyed, and new ones, erected in their places,\r\nhave been destroyed too, sometimes in rapid succession. Yet, through all\r\nthe extraordinary, the most extraordinary scenes of this half-century,\r\nthe free, popular, representative government of the United States has\r\nstood, and has afforded security for liberty, for property, and for\r\nreputation, to all citizens.\r\n\r\nThat it has been exposed to many dangers, that it has met critical\r\nmoments, is certain. That it is now exposed to dangers, and that a\r\ncrisis is now before it, is equally clear, in my judgment. But it has\r\nhitherto been preserved, and vigilance and patriotism may rescue it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nOur dangers, Gentlemen, are not from _without_. We have nothing to\r\nfear from foreign powers, except those interruptions of the occupations\r\nof life which all wars occasion. The dangers to our system, as a\r\nsystem, do not spring from that quarter. On the contrary, the pressure\r\nof foreign hostility would be most likely to unite us, and to\r\nstrengthen our union, by an augmented sense of its utility and\r\nnecessity. But our dangers are from within. I do not now speak of those\r\ndangers which have in all ages beset republican governments, such as\r\nluxury among the rich, the corruption of public officers, and the\r\ngeneral degradation of public morals. I speak only of those peculiar\r\ndangers to which the structure of our government particularly exposes\r\nit, in addition to all other ordinary dangers. These arise among\r\nourselves; they spring up at home; and the evil which they threaten is\r\nno less than disunion, or the overthrow of the whole system. Local\r\nfeelings and local parties, a notion sometimes a sedulously cultivated\r\nof opposite interests in different portions of the Union, evil\r\nprophecies respecting its duration, cool calculations upon the\r\nbenefits of separation, a narrow feeling that cannot embrace all the\r\nStates as one country, an unsocial, anti-national, and half-belligerent\r\nspirit, which sometimes betrays itself,--all these undoubtedly are\r\ncauses which affect, more or less, our prospect of holding together.\r\nAll these are unpropitious influences.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, again, is founded on compromise, and the most perfect\r\nand absolute good faith, in regard to every stipulation of this kind\r\ncontained in it is indispensable to its preservation. Every attempt to\r\naccomplish even the best purpose, every attempt to grasp that which is\r\nregarded as an immediate good, in violation of these stipulations, is\r\nfull of danger to the whole Constitution. I need not say, also, that\r\npossible collision between the general and the State governments always\r\nhas been, is, and ever must be, a source of danger to be strictly\r\nwatched by wise men.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, as I have spoken of dangers now, in my judgment actually\r\nexisting, I will state at once my opinions on that point, without fear\r\nand without reserve. I reproach no man, I accuse no man; but I speak of\r\nthings as they appear to me, and I speak of principles and practices\r\nwhich I deem most alarming. I think, then, Gentlemen, that a great\r\npractical change is going on in the Constitution, which, if not checked,\r\nmust completely alter its whole character. This change consists in the\r\ndiminution of the just powers of Congress on the one hand, and in the\r\nvast increase of executive authority on the other. The government of the\r\nUnited States, in the aggregate, or the legislative power of Congress,\r\nseems fast losing, one after another, its accustomed powers. One by one,\r\nthey are practically struck out of the Constitution. What has become of\r\nthe power of internal improvement? Does it remain in the Constitution,\r\nor is it erased by the repeated exercise of the President's veto, and\r\nthe acquiescence in that exercise of all who call themselves his\r\nfriends, whatever their own opinions of the Constitution may be? The\r\npower to create a national bank, a power exercised for forty years,\r\napproved by all Presidents, and by Congress at all times, and sanctioned\r\nby a solemn adjudication of the Supreme Court, is it not true that party\r\nhas agreed to strike this power, too, from the Constitution, in\r\ncompliance with what has been openly called the interests of party? Nay,\r\nmore; that great power, the power of protecting domestic industry, who\r\ncan tell me whether that power is now regarded as in the Constitution,\r\nor out of it?\r\n\r\nBut, if it be true that the diminution of the just powers of Congress,\r\nin these particulars, has been attempted, and attempted with more or\r\nless success, it is still more obvious, I think, that the executive\r\npower of the government has been dangerously increased. It is spread,\r\nin the first place, over all that ground from which the legislative\r\npower of Congress is driven. Congress can no longer establish a bank,\r\ncontrolled by the laws of the United States, amenable to the authority,\r\nand open, at all times, to the examination and inspection of the\r\nlegislature. It is no longer constitutional to make such a bank, for the\r\nsafe custody of the public treasure. But of the thousand State\r\ncorporations already existing, it is constitutional for the executive\r\ngovernment to select such as it pleases, to intrust the public money to\r\ntheir keeping, without responsibility to the laws of the United States,\r\nwithout the duty of exhibiting their concerns, at any time, to the\r\ncommittees of Congress, and with no other guards or securities than such\r\nas executive discretion on the one hand, and the banks themselves on the\r\nother, may see fit to agree to.\r\n\r\nAnd so of internal improvement. It is not every thing in the nature of\r\npublic improvements which is forbidden. It is only that the selection of\r\nobjects is not with Congress. Whatever appears to the executive\r\ndiscretion to be of a proper nature, or such as comes within certain not\r\nvery intelligible limits, may be tolerated. And even with respect to the\r\ntariff itself, while as a system it is denounced as unconstitutional, it\r\nis probable some portion of it might find favor.\r\n\r\nBut it is not the frequent use of the power of the veto, it is not the\r\nreadiness with which men yield their own opinions, and see important\r\npowers practically obliterated from the Constitution, in order to\r\nsubserve the interest of the party, it is not even all this which\r\nfurnishes, at the present moment, the most striking demonstration of the\r\nincrease of executive authority. It is the use of the power of\r\npatronage; it is the universal giving and taking away of all place and\r\noffice, for reasons no way connected with the public service, or the\r\nfaithful execution of the laws; it is this which threatens with\r\noverthrow all the true principles of the government. Patronage is\r\nreduced to a system. It is used as the patrimony, the property of party.\r\nEvery office is a largess, a bounty, a favor; and it is expected to be\r\ncompensated by service and fealty. A numerous and well-disciplined corps\r\nof office-holders, acting with activity and zeal, and with incredible\r\nunion of purpose, is attempting to seize on the strong posts, and to\r\ncontrol, effectually, the expression of the public will. As has been\r\nsaid of the Turks in Europe, they are not so much mingled with us, as\r\nencamped among us. And it is more lamentable, that the apathy which\r\nprevails in a time of general prosperity produces, among a great\r\nmajority of the people, a disregard to the efforts and objects of this\r\nwell-trained and effective corps. But, Gentlemen, the principle is\r\nvicious; it is destructive and ruinous; and whether it produces its work\r\nof disunion to-day or to-morrow, it must produce it in the end. It must\r\ndestroy the balance of the government, and so destroy the government\r\nitself. The government of the United States controls the army, the navy,\r\nthe custom-house, the post-office, the land-offices, and other great\r\nsources of patronage. What have the States to oppose to all this? And if\r\nthe States shall see all this patronage, if they shall see every officer\r\nunder this government, in all its ramifications, united with every other\r\nofficer, and all acting steadily in a design to produce political\r\neffect, even in State governments, is it possible not to perceive that\r\nthey will, before long, regard the whole government of the Union with\r\ndistrust and jealousy, and finally with fear and hatred?\r\n\r\nAmong other evils, it is the tendency of this system to push party\r\nfeelings and party spirit to their utmost excess. It involves not only\r\nopinions and principles, but the pursuits of life and the means of\r\nliving, in the contests of party. The executive himself becomes but the\r\nmere point of concentration of party power; and when executive power is\r\nexercised or is claimed for the supposed benefit of party, party will\r\napprove and justify it. When did heated and exasperated party ever\r\ncomplain of its leaders for seizing on new degrees of power?\r\n\r\nThis system of government has been openly avowed. Offices of trust are\r\ndeclared, from high places, to be the regular spoils of party victory;\r\nand all that is furnished out of the public purse, as a reward for labor\r\nin the public service, becomes thus a boon, offered to personal devotion\r\nand partisan service. The uncontrolled power of removal is the spring\r\nwhich moves all this machinery; and I verily believe the government is,\r\nand will be, in serious danger, till some check is placed on that power.\r\nTo combine and consolidate a great party by the influence of personal\r\nhopes, to govern by the patronage of office, to exercise the power of\r\nremoval at pleasure, in order to render that patronage effectual,--this\r\nseems to be the sum and substance of the political systems of the times.\r\nI am sorry to say, that the germ of this system had its first being in\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nThe policy began in the last year of Mr. Adams's administration, when\r\nnominations made by him to fill vacancies occurring by death or\r\nresignation were postponed, by a vote of the majority of the Senate, to\r\na period beyond the ensuing 4th of March; and this was done with no\r\nother view than that of giving the patronage of these appointments to\r\nthe incoming President. The nomination of a judge of the Supreme Court,\r\namong others, was thus disposed of. The regular action of the government\r\nwas, in this manner, deranged, and undue and unjustly obtained patronage\r\ncame to be received as among the ordinary means of government. Some of\r\nthe gentlemen who concurred in this vote have since, probably, seen\r\noccasion to regret it. But they thereby let loose the lion of executive\r\nprerogative, and they have not yet found out how they can drive it back\r\nagain to its cage. The debates in the Senate on these questions, in the\r\nsession of 1828-29, are not public; but I take this occasion to say,\r\nthat the minority of the Senate, as it was then constituted, including,\r\namong others, myself and colleague, contended against this innovation\r\nupon the Constitution, for days and for weeks; but we contended in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of patronage thus got a foothold in the government. A\r\ngeneral removal from office followed, exciting, at first, no small share\r\nof public attention; but every exercise of the power rendered its\r\nexercise in the next case still easier, till removal at will has become\r\nthe actual system on which the government is administered.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly a fit occasion, Gentlemen, to go into the history of this\r\npower of removal. It was declared to exist in the days of Washington, by\r\na very small majority in each house of Congress. It has been considered\r\nas existing to the present time. But no man expected it to be used as a\r\nmere arbitrary power; and those who maintained its existence declared,\r\nnevertheless, that it would justly become matter of impeachment, if it\r\nshould be used for purposes such as those to which the most blind among\r\nus must admit they have recently seen it habitually applied. I have the\r\nhighest respect for those who originally concurred in this construction\r\nof the Constitution. But, as discreet men of the day were divided on the\r\nquestion, as Madison and other distinguished names were on one side, and\r\nGerry and other distinguished names on the other, one may now differ\r\nfrom either, without incurring the imputation of arrogance, since he\r\nmust differ from some of them. I confess my judgment would have been,\r\nthat the power of removal did not belong to the President alone; that it\r\nwas but a part of the power of appointment, since the power of\r\nappointing one man to office implies the power of vacating that office,\r\nby removing another out of it; and as the whole power of appointment is\r\ngranted, not to the President alone, but to the President and Senate,\r\nthe true interpretation of the Constitution would have carried the power\r\nof removal into the same hands. I have, however, so recently expressed\r\nmy sentiments on this point in another place, that it would be improper\r\nto pursue this line of observation further.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the last session, Gentlemen, several bills passed the\r\nSenate, intended to correct abuses, to restrain useless expenditure, to\r\ncurtail the discretionary authority of public officers, and to control\r\ngovernment patronage. The post-office bill, the custom-house bill, and\r\nthe bill respecting the tenure of office, were all of this class. None\r\nof them, however, received the favorable consideration of the other\r\nhouse. I believe, that in all these respects a reform, a real, honest\r\nreform, is decidedly necessary to the security of the Constitution; and\r\nwhile I continue in public life, I shall not halt in my endeavors to\r\nproduce it. It is time to bring back the government to its true\r\ncharacter as an agency for the people. It is time to declare that\r\noffices, created for the people, are public trusts, not private spoils.\r\nIt is time to bring each and every department within its true original\r\nlimits. It is time to assent, on one hand, to the just powers of\r\nCongress, in their full extent, and to resist, on the other, the\r\nprogress and rapid growth of executive authority.\r\n\r\nThese, Gentlemen, are my opinions. I have spoken them frankly, and\r\nwithout reserve. Under present circumstances, I should wish to avoid any\r\nconcealment, and to state my political opinions in their full length and\r\nbreadth. I desire not to stand before the country as a man of no\r\nopinions, or of such a mixture of opposite opinions that the result has\r\nno character at all. On the contrary, I am desirous of standing as one\r\nwho is bound to his own consistency by the frankest avowal of his\r\nsentiments, on all important and interesting subjects. I am not partly\r\nfor the Constitution, and partly against it; I am wholly for it, for it\r\naltogether, for it as it is, and for the exercise, when occasion\r\nrequires, of all its just powers, as they have heretofore been\r\nexercised by Washington, and the great men who have followed him in its\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nI disdain, altogether, the character of an uncommitted man. I am\r\ncommitted, fully committed; committed to the full extent of all that I\r\nam, and all that I hope, to the Constitution of the country, to its love\r\nand reverence, to its defence and maintenance, to its warm commendation\r\nto every American heart, and to its vindication and just praise, before\r\nall mankind. And I am committed _against_ every thing which, in my\r\njudgment, may weaken, endanger, or destroy it. I am committed against\r\nthe encouragement of local parties and local feelings; I am committed\r\nagainst all fostering of anti-national spirit; I am committed against\r\nthe slightest infringement of the original compromise on which the\r\nConstitution was founded; I am committed against any and every\r\nderangement of the powers of the several departments of the government,\r\nagainst any derogation from the constitutional authority of Congress,\r\nand especially against all extension of executive power; and I am\r\ncommitted against any attempt to rule the free people of this country by\r\nthe power and the patronage of the government itself. I am committed,\r\nfully and entirely committed, against making the government the people's\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nThese, Gentlemen, are my opinions. I have purposely avowed them with the\r\nutmost frankness. They are not the sentiments of the moment, but the\r\nresult of much reflection, and of some experience in the affairs of the\r\ncountry. I believe them to be such sentiments as are alone compatible\r\nwith the permanent prosperity of the country, or the long continuance of\r\nits union.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Gentlemen, having thus solemnly avowed these sentiments and\r\nthese convictions, if you should find me hereafter to be false to them,\r\nor to falter in their support, I now conjure you, by all the duty you\r\nowe your country, by all your hopes of her prosperity and renown, by all\r\nyour love for the general cause of liberty throughout the world,--I\r\nconjure you, that, renouncing me as a recreant, you yourselves go on,\r\nright on, straightforward, in maintaining, with your utmost zeal and\r\nwith all your power, the true principles of the best, the happiest, the\r\nmost glorious Constitution of a free government, with which it has\r\npleased Providence, in any age, to bless any of the nations of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n  [104] Speech delivered in the Odeon, at Boston, on Occasion of the\r\n        Presentation of a Vase by Citizens of that Place, on the 12th of\r\n        October, 1835.\r\n\r\n  [105] The Senate of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEPTION AT NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  At a meeting of the political friends of the Hon. Daniel Webster,\r\n  held at Euterpian Hall, in the city of New York, on Tuesday evening,\r\n  the 21st of February, 1837, Chancellor Kent was called to the chair,\r\n  and Messrs. Hiram Ketchum and Gabriel P. Dissosway were appointed\r\n  secretaries.\r\n\r\n  The object of the meeting having been explained, the following\r\n  resolutions were, on motion, duly seconded and unanimously\r\n  adopted:--\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That this meeting has heard with deep concern of the\r\nintention of the Hon. Daniel Webster to resign his seat in the Senate of\r\nthe United States at the close of the present session of Congress, or\r\nearly in the next session.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That while we regret the resignation of Mr. Webster, it\r\nwould be most unreasonable to censure the exercise of his right to seek\r\nrepose, after fourteen years of unremitted, zealous, and highly\r\ndistinguished labors in the Congress of the United States; but we\r\nindulge the hope that the nation will, at no distant day, again profit\r\nby his ripe experience as a statesman and his extensive knowledge of\r\npublic affairs, by his wisdom in council and eloquence in debate.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That in the judgment of this meeting there is none among\r\nthe living or the dead who has given to the country more just or able\r\nexpositions of the Constitution of the United States; none who has\r\nenforced, with more lucid and impassionate eloquence, the necessity and\r\nimportance of the preservation of the Union, or exhibited more zeal or\r\nability in defending the Constitution from the foes without the\r\ngovernment, and foes within it, than Daniel Webster.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That there is no part of our widely extended country more\r\ndeeply interested in the preservation of the Union than the city of New\r\nYork; her motto should be 'Union and Liberty, now and for ever, one and\r\ninseparable,' and her gratitude should be shown to the statesman who\r\nfirst gave utterance to this sentiment.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That David B. Ogden, Peter Stagg, Jonathan Thompson, James\r\nBrown, Philip Hone, Samuel Stevens, Robert Smith, Joseph Tucker, Peter\r\nSharpe, Egbert Benson, Hugh Maxwell, Peter A. Jay, Aaron Clark, Ira B.\r\nWheeler, William W. Todd, Seth Grosvenor, Simeon Draper, Jr., Wm.\r\nAspinwall, Nathaniel Weed, Jonathan Goodhue, Caleb Bartow, Hiram\r\nKetchum, Gabriel P. Dissosway, Henry K. Bogert, James Kent, Wm. S.\r\nJohnson, and John W. Leavitt, Esqrs., be a committee authorized and\r\nempowered to receive the Hon. Daniel Webster on his return from\r\nWashington, and make known to him, in the form of an address or\r\notherwise, the sentiments which this meeting, in common with the friends\r\nof the Union and the Constitution in the city, entertain for the\r\nservices which he has performed for the country; that the committee\r\ncorrespond with Mr. Webster, and ascertain the time when his arrival may\r\nbe expected, and give public notice of the same, together with the order\r\nof proceedings which may be adopted under these resolutions.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That these resolutions, signed by the Chairman and\r\nSecretaries, be published when the committee shall notify the public of\r\nthe expected arrival of Mr. Webster.\r\n\r\n\"JAMES KENT, _Chairman_.\r\n\r\n\"HIRAM KETCHUM, GABRIEL P. DISSOSWAY, _Secretaries_.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_New York, March 1, 1837._\r\n\r\n\"SIR:--It having been currently reported that you have signified your\r\nintention to resign your seat in the Senate of the United States, a\r\nnumber of the friends of the Union and the Constitution in this city\r\nwere convened on the evening of the 21st of last month, to devise\r\nmeasures whereby they might signify to you the sentiments which they, in\r\ncommon with all the Whigs in this city, entertain for the eminent\r\nservices you have rendered to the country. At this meeting, the Hon.\r\nJames Kent was called to the chair, and resolutions, a copy of which I\r\ninclose you, were adopted, not only with entire unanimity, but with a\r\nfeeling of warm and hearty concurrence. On behalf of the committee\r\nappointed under one of these resolutions, I now have the honor to\r\naddress you. It will be gratifying to the committee to learn from you at\r\nwhat time you expect to arrive in this city on your return to\r\nMassachusetts. If informed of the time of your arrival, it will afford\r\nthe committee pleasure to meet you, and, in behalf of the Whigs of New\r\nYork, to welcome you, and to offer you, in a more extended form than the\r\nresolutions present, their views of your public services. I am\r\ninstructed by the committee to say, that, whether you shall choose to\r\nappear among us as a public man or a private citizen, you will be warmly\r\ngreeted by every sound friend of that Constitution for which you have\r\nbeen so distinguished a champion. Should your resolution to resign your\r\nseat in the Senate be relinquished, you will, in the opinion of the\r\ncommittee, impose new obligations upon the friends of the Union and the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to be, very truly, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"D. B. OGDEN.\r\n\r\n\"To Hon. DANIEL WEBSTER, Washington.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_Washington, March 4th, 1837._\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR:--I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your\r\nletter of the 1st instant, communicating the resolutions adopted at a\r\nmeeting of a number of political friends in New York.\r\n\r\n\"The character of these resolutions, and the kindness of the sentiments\r\nexpressed in your letter, have filled me with unaffected gratitude. I\r\nfeel, at the same time, how little deserving are any political services\r\nof mine of such commendation from such a source. To the discharge of the\r\nduties of my public situation, sometimes both anxious and difficult, I\r\nhave devoted time and labor without reserve; and have made sacrifices of\r\npersonal and private convenience not always unimportant. These, together\r\nwith integrity of purpose and fidelity, constitute, I am conscious, my\r\nonly claim to the public regard; and for all these I find myself richly\r\ncompensated by proofs of approbation such as your communication\r\naffords.\r\n\r\n\"My desire to relinquish my seat in the Senate for the two years still\r\nremaining of the term for which I was chosen, would have been carried\r\ninto execution at the close of the present session of the Senate, had\r\nnot circumstances existed which, in the judgment of others, rendered it\r\nexpedient to defer the fulfilment of that purpose for the present.\r\n\r\n\"It is my expectation to be in New York early in the week after next;\r\nand it will give me pleasure to meet the political friends who have\r\ntendered me this kind and respectful attention, in any manner most\r\nagreeable to them.\r\n\r\n\"I pray you to accept for yourself, and the other gentlemen of the\r\ncommittee, my highest regard.\r\n\r\n\"DANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n\"To D. B. OGDEN, Esq., New York.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"At a meeting of the committee appointed under the above resolution,\r\nPhilip Hone, Robert Smith, John W. Leavitt, Egbert Benson, Ira B.\r\nWheeler, Caleb Bartow, Simeon Draper, Jr., and Wm. S. Johnson, Esqrs.,\r\nwere appointed a sub-committee to make arrangements for the reception of\r\nMr. Webster. The committee have corresponded with Mr. Webster, and\r\nascertained that he will leave Philadelphia on the morning of Wednesday\r\nnext. He will be met by the committee, and, on landing at Whitehall, at\r\nabout two o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, will thence be conducted by\r\nthe committee, accompanied by such other citizens as choose to join\r\nthem, to a place hereafter to be designated. In the evening, at half\r\npast six o'clock, he will be addressed by the committee, in a public\r\nmeeting of citizens, at Niblo's Saloon.\r\n\r\n\"D. B. OGDEN, _Chairman_.\"\r\n\r\n  On the subsequent day, March 15th, the committee appointed for\r\n  that purpose met Mr. Webster at Amboy, and accompanied him to\r\n  the city, where he was met, on landing, by a very numerous\r\n  assemblage of citizens, who thronged to see the distinguished\r\n  Senator, and give him a warm welcome; after landing, he was\r\n  attended by the committee and a numerous cavalcade through Broadway,\r\n  which was crowded with the most respectable citizens, to lodgings\r\n  provided for him at the American Hotel. Here he made a short address\r\n  to the assembled citizens, and in the evening was accompanied by\r\n  the committee to Niblo's Saloon. One of the largest meetings ever\r\n  held in the city of New York assembled in the Saloon, and at half\r\n  past six o'clock was called to order by AARON CLARK; DAVID B.\r\n  OGDEN was called to the chair as President of the meeting; Robert\r\n  C. Cornell, Jonathan Goodhue, Joseph Tucker, and Nathaniel Weed\r\n  were nominated Vice-Presidents; and Joseph Hoxie and George S.\r\n  Robbins, Secretaries.\r\n\r\n  After the meeting was organized, PHILIP HONE introduced Mr. Webster\r\n  with a few appropriate remarks, and he was received with the most\r\n  enthusiastic greetings. Mr. OGDEN then addressed him as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"On behalf of a committee, appointed at a meeting of a number of your\r\npersonal and political friends in this city, I have now the honor of\r\naddressing you.\r\n\r\n\"It has afforded the committee, and, I may add, all your political\r\nfriends, unmingled pleasure to learn that you have, at least for the\r\npresent, relinquished the intention which I know you had formed of\r\nresigning your seat in the Senate of the United States. While expressing\r\ntheir feelings upon this change in your determination, the committee\r\ncannot avoid congratulating the country that your public services are\r\nnot yet to be lost to it and that the great champion of the Constitution\r\nand of the Union is still to continue in the field upon which he has\r\nearned so many laurels, and has so nobly asserted and defended the\r\nrights and liberties of the people.\r\n\r\n\"The effort made by you, and the honorable men with whom you have acted\r\nin the Senate, to resist executive encroachments upon the other\r\ndepartments of the government, will ever be remembered with gratitude by\r\nthe friends of American liberty. That these efforts were not more\r\nsuccessful, we shall long have reason to remember and regret. The\r\nadministration of General Jackson is fortunately at an end. Its effects\r\nupon the Constitution and upon the commercial prosperity of the country\r\nare not at an end. Without attempting to review the leading measures of\r\nhis administration, every man engaged in business in New York feels,\r\nmost sensibly, that his experiment upon the currency has produced the\r\nevils which you foretold it would produce. It has brought distress, to\r\nan extent never before experienced, upon the men of enterprise and of\r\nsmall capital, and has put all the primary power in the hands of a few\r\ngreat capitalists.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the Senate our eyes and our hopes are fixed; we know that you and\r\nyour political friends are in a minority in that body, but we know that\r\nin that minority are to be found great talents, great experience, great\r\npatriotism, and we look for great and continued exertions to maintain\r\nthe Constitution, the Union, and the liberties of this people. And we\r\ntake this opportunity of expressing our entire confidence, that whatever\r\nmen can do in a minority will be done in the Senate to relieve the\r\ncountry from the evils under which she is now laboring, and to save her\r\nfrom being sacrificed by folly, corruption, or usurpation.\r\n\r\n\"It gives me, Sir, pleasure to be the organ of the committee to express\r\nto you their great respect for your talents, their deep sense of the\r\nimportance of your public services, and their gratification to learn\r\nthat you will still continue in the Senate.\"\r\n\r\n  To this address Mr. WEBSTER replied in the following speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEPTION AT NEW YORK.[106]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN, AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:--It would be idle in me to affect to\r\nbe indifferent to the circumstances under which I have now the honor of\r\naddressing you.\r\n\r\nI find myself in the commercial metropolis of the continent, in the\r\nmidst of a vast assembly of intelligent men, drawn from all the classes,\r\nprofessions, and pursuits of life.\r\n\r\nAnd you have been pleased, Gentlemen, to meet me, in this imposing\r\nmanner, and to offer me a warm and cordial welcome to your city. I thank\r\nyou. I feel the full force and importance of this manifestation of your\r\nregard. In the highly-flattering resolutions which invited me here, in\r\nthe respectability of this vast multitude of my fellow-citizens, and in\r\nthe approbation and hearty good-will which you have here manifested, I\r\nfeel cause for profound and grateful acknowledgment.\r\n\r\nTo every individual of this meeting, therefore, I would now most\r\nrespectfully make that acknowledgment; and with every one, as with hands\r\njoined in mutual greeting, I reciprocate friendly salutation, respect,\r\nand good wishes.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, although I am well assured of your personal regard, I\r\ncannot fail to know, that the times, the political and commercial\r\ncondition of things which exists among us, and an intelligent spirit,\r\nawakened to new activity and a new degree of anxiety, have mainly\r\ncontributed to fill these avenues and crowd these halls. At a moment of\r\ndifficulty, and of much alarm, you come here as Whigs of New York, to\r\nmeet one whom you believe to be bound to you by common principles and\r\ncommon sentiments, and pursuing, with you, a common object Gentlemen, I\r\nam proud to admit this community of our principles, and this identity of\r\nour objects. You are for the Constitution of the country; so am I. You\r\nare for the Union of the States: so am I. You are for equal laws, for\r\nthe equal rights of all men, for constitutional and just restraints on\r\npower, for the substance and not the shadowy image only of popular\r\ninstitutions, for a government which has liberty for its spirit and\r\nsoul, as well as in its forms; and so am I. You feel that if, in warm\r\nparty times, the executive power is in hands distinguished for boldness,\r\nfor great success, for perseverance, and other qualities which strike\r\nmen's minds strongly, there is danger of derangement of the powers of\r\ngovernment, danger of a new division of those powers, in which the\r\nexecutive is likely to obtain the lion's part; and danger of a state of\r\nthings in which the more popular branches of the government, instead of\r\nbeing guards and sentinels against any encroachments from the executive,\r\nseek, rather, support from its patronage, safety against the complaints\r\nof the people in its ample and all-protecting favor, and refuge in its\r\npower; and so I feel, and so I have felt for eight long and anxious\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nYou believe that a very efficient and powerful cause in the production\r\nof the evils which now fall on the industrious and commercial classes of\r\nthe community, is the derangement of the currency, the destruction of\r\nthe exchanges, and the unnatural and unnecessary _misplacement_ of the\r\nspecie of the country, by unauthorized and illegal treasury orders. So\r\ndo I believe. I predicted all this from the beginning, and from before\r\nthe beginning. I predicted it all, last spring, when that was attempted\r\nto be done by law which was afterwards done by executive authority; and\r\nfrom the moment of the exercise of that executive authority to the\r\npresent time, I have both foreseen and seen the regular progress of\r\nthings under it, from inconvenience and embarrassment, to pressure, loss\r\nof confidence, disorder, and bankruptcies.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I mean, on this occasion, to speak my sentiments freely on\r\nthe great topics of the day. I have nothing to conceal, and shall\r\ntherefore conceal nothing. In regard to political sentiments,\r\npurposes, or objects, there is nothing in my heart which I am ashamed\r\nof; I shall throw it all open, therefore, to you, and to all men.\r\n[That is right, said some one in the crowd; let us have it, with no\r\nnon-committal.] Yes, my friend, without non-committal or evasion,\r\nwithout barren generalities or empty phrase, without _if_ or _but_,\r\nwithout a single touch, in all I say, bearing the oracular character of\r\nan Inaugural, I shall, on this occasion, speak my mind plainly,\r\nfreely, and independently, to men who are just as free to concur or not\r\nto concur in my sentiments, as I am to utter them. I think you are\r\nentitled to hear my opinions freely and frankly spoken; but I freely\r\nacknowledge that you are still more clearly entitled to retain, and\r\nmaintain, your own opinions, however they may differ or agree with\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nIt is true, Gentlemen, that I have contemplated the relinquishment of my\r\nseat in the Senate for the residue of the term, now two years, for\r\nwhich I was chosen. This resolution was not taken from disgust or\r\ndiscouragement, although some things have certainly happened which\r\nmight excite both those feelings. But in popular governments, men\r\nmust not suffer themselves to be permanently disgusted by occasional\r\nexhibitions of political harlequinism, or deeply discouraged, although\r\ntheir efforts to awaken the people to what they deem the dangerous\r\ntendency of public measures be not crowned with immediate success. It\r\nwas altogether from other causes, and other considerations, that, after\r\nan uninterrupted service of fourteen or fifteen years, I naturally\r\ndesired a respite. But those whose opinions I am bound to respect\r\nsaw objections to a present withdrawal from Congress; and I have yielded\r\nmy own strong desire to their convictions of what the public good\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, in speaking here on the subjects which now so much interest\r\nthe community, I wish in the outset to disclaim all personal disrespect\r\ntowards individuals. He whose character and fortune have exercised such\r\na decisive influence on our politics for eight years, has now retired\r\nfrom public station. I pursue him with no personal reflections, no\r\nreproaches. Between him and myself, there has always existed a\r\nrespectful personal intercourse. Moments have existed, indeed, critical\r\nand decisive upon the general success of his administration, in which he\r\nhas been pleased to regard my aid as not altogether unimportant I now\r\nspeak of him respectfully, as a distinguished soldier, as one who, in\r\nthat character, has done the state much service; as a man, too, of\r\nstrong and decided character, of unsubdued resolution and perseverance\r\nin whatever he undertakes. In speaking of his civil administration, I\r\nspeak without censoriousness or harsh imputation of motives; I wish him\r\nhealth and happiness in his retirement; but I must still speak as I\r\nthink of his public measures, and of their general bearing and tendency,\r\nnot only on the present interests of the country, but also on the\r\nwell-being and security of the government itself.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some topics of a less urgent present application and\r\nimportance, upon which I wish to say a few words, before I advert to\r\nthose which are more immediately connected with the present distressed\r\nstate of things.\r\n\r\nMy learned and highly-valued friend (Mr. Ogden) who has addressed me in\r\nyour behalf, has been kindly pleased to speak of my political career as\r\nbeing marked by a freedom from local interests and prejudices, and a\r\ndevotion to liberal and comprehensive views of public policy.\r\n\r\nI will not say that this compliment is deserved. I will only say, that I\r\nhave earnestly endeavored to deserve it. Gentlemen, the general\r\ngovernment, to the extent of its power, is national. It is not\r\nconsolidated, it does not embrace all powers of government. On the\r\ncontrary, it is delegated, restrained, strictly limited.\r\n\r\nBut what powers it does possess, it possesses for the general, not\r\nfor any partial or local good. It extends over a vast territory,\r\nembracing now six-and-twenty States, with interests various, but not\r\nirreconcilable, infinitely diversified, but capable of being all blended\r\ninto political harmony.\r\n\r\nHe, however, who would produce this harmony must survey the whole field,\r\nas if all parts were as interesting to himself as they are to others,\r\nand with that generous, patriotic feeling, prompter and better than the\r\nmere dictates of cool reason, which leads him to embrace the whole with\r\naffectionate regard, as constituting, altogether, that object which he\r\nis so much bound to respect, to defend, and to love,--his country. We\r\nhave around us, and more or less within the influence and protection of\r\nthe general government, all the great interests of agriculture,\r\nnavigation, commerce, manufactures, the fisheries, and the mechanic\r\narts. The duties of the government, then, certainly extend over all this\r\nterritory, and embrace all these vast interests. We have a maritime\r\nfrontier, a sea-coast, of many thousand miles; and while no one doubts\r\nthat it is the duty of government to defend this coast by suitable\r\nmilitary preparations, there are those who yet suppose that the powers\r\nof government stop at this point; and that as to works of peace and\r\nworks of improvement, they are beyond our constitutional limits. I have\r\never thought otherwise. Congress has a right, no doubt, to declare war,\r\nand to provide armies and navies; and it has necessarily the right to\r\nbuild fortifications and batteries, to protect the coast from the\r\neffects of war. But Congress has authority also, and it is its duty, to\r\nregulate commerce, and it has the whole power of collecting duties on\r\nimports and tonnage. It must have ports and harbors, and dock-yards\r\nalso, for its navies. Very early in the history of the government, it\r\nwas decided by Congress, on the report of a highly respectable\r\ncommittee, that the transfer by the States to Congress of the power of\r\ncollecting tonnage and other duties, and the grant of the authority to\r\nregulate commerce, charged Congress, necessarily, with the duty of\r\nmaintaining such piers and wharves and light-houses, and of making such\r\nimprovements, as might have been expected to be done by the States, if\r\nthey had retained the usual means, by retaining the power of collecting\r\nduties on imports. The States, it was admitted, had parted with this\r\npower; and the duty of protecting and facilitating commerce by these\r\nmeans had passed, along with this power, into other hands. I have never\r\nhesitated, therefore, when the state of the treasury would admit, to\r\nvote for reasonable appropriations, for breakwaters, light-houses,\r\npiers, harbors, and similar public works, on any part of the whole\r\nAtlantic coast or the Gulf of Mexico, from Maine to Louisiana.\r\n\r\nBut how stands the inland frontier? How is it along the vast lakes and\r\nthe mighty rivers of the North and West? Do our constitutional rights\r\nand duties terminate where the water ceases to be salt? or do they\r\nexist, in full vigor, on the shores of these inland seas? I never could\r\ndoubt about this; and yet, Gentlemen, I remember even to have\r\nparticipated in a warm debate, in the Senate, some years ago, upon the\r\nconstitutional right of Congress to make an appropriation for a pier in\r\nthe harbor of Buffalo. What! make a harbor at Buffalo, where Nature\r\nnever made any, and where therefore it was never intended any ever\r\nshould be made! Take money from the people to run out piers from the\r\nsandy shores of Lake Erie, or deepen the channels of her shallow\r\nrivers! Where was the constitutional authority for this? Where would\r\nsuch strides of power stop? How long would the States have any powers at\r\nall left, if their territory might be ruthlessly invaded for such\r\nunhallowed purposes, or how long would the people have any money in\r\ntheir pockets, if the government of the United States might tax them, at\r\npleasure, for such extravagant project as these? Piers, wharves,\r\nharbors, and breakwaters in the Lakes! These arguments, Gentlemen,\r\nhowever earnestly put forth heretofore, do not strike us with great\r\npower, at the present day, if we stand on the shores of Lake Erie, and\r\nsee hundreds of vessels, with valuable cargoes and thousands of valuable\r\nlives, moving on its waters, with few shelters from the storm, except\r\nwhat is furnished by the havens created, or made useful, by the aid of\r\ngovernment. These great lakes, stretching away many thousands of miles,\r\nnot in a straight line, but with turns and deflections, as if designed\r\nto reach, by water communication, the greatest possible number of\r\nimportant points through a region of vast extent, cannot but arrest the\r\nattention of any one who looks upon the map. They lie connected, but\r\nvariously placed; and interspersed, as if with studied variety of form\r\nand direction, over that part of the country. They were made for man,\r\nand admirably adapted for his use and convenience. Looking, Gentlemen,\r\nover our whole country, comprehending in our survey the Atlantic coast,\r\nwith its thick population, its advanced agriculture, its extended\r\ncommerce, its manufactures and mechanic arts, its varieties of\r\ncommunication, its wealth, and its general improvements; and looking,\r\nthen, to the interior, to the immense tracts of fresh, fertile, and\r\ncheap lands, bounded by so many lakes, and watered by so many\r\nmagnificent rivers, let me ask if such a MAP was ever before presented\r\nto the eye of any statesman, as the theatre for the exercise of his\r\nwisdom and patriotism? And let me ask, too, if any man is fit to act a\r\npart, on such a theatre, who does not comprehend the whole of it within\r\nthe scope of his policy, and embrace it all as his country?\r\n\r\nAgain, Gentlemen, we are one in respect to the glorious Constitution\r\nunder which we live. We are all united in the great brotherhood of\r\nAmerican liberty. Descending from the same ancestors, bred in the same\r\nschool, taught in infancy to imbibe the same general political\r\nsentiments, Americans all, by birth, education, and principle, what but\r\na narrow mind, or woful ignorance, or besotted selfishness, or prejudice\r\nten times blinded, can lead any of us to regard the citizens of any part\r\nof the country as strangers and aliens?\r\n\r\nThe solemn truth, moreover, is before us, that a common political fate\r\nattends us all.\r\n\r\nUnder the present Constitution, wisely and conscientiously administered,\r\nall are safe, happy, and renowned. The measure of our country's fame may\r\nfill all our breasts. It is fame enough for us all to partake in _her_\r\nglory, if we will carry her character onward to its true destiny. But if\r\nthe system is broken, its fragments must fall alike on all. Not only the\r\ncause of American liberty, but the grand cause of liberty throughout the\r\nwhole earth, depends, in a great measure, on upholding the Constitution\r\nand Union of these States. If shattered and destroyed, no matter by what\r\ncause, the peculiar and cherished idea of United American Liberty will\r\nbe no more for ever. There may be free states, it is possible, when\r\nthere shall be separate states. There may be many loose, and feeble, and\r\nhostile confederacies, where there is now one great and united\r\nconfederacy. But the noble idea of United American Liberty, of _our_\r\nliberty, such as our fathers established it, will be extinguished for\r\never. Fragments and shattered columns of the edifice may be found\r\nremaining; and melancholy and mournful ruins will they be. The august\r\ntemple itself will be prostrate in the dust. Gentlemen, the citizens of\r\nthis republic cannot sever their fortunes. A common fate awaits us. In\r\nthe honor of upholding, or in the disgrace of undermining the\r\nConstitution, we shall all necessarily partake. Let us then stand by the\r\nConstitution as it is, and by our country as it is, one, united, and\r\nentire; let it be a truth engraven on our hearts, let it be borne on the\r\nflag under which we rally, in every exigency, that we have ONE COUNTRY,\r\nONE CONSTITUTION, ONE DESTINY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGentlemen, of our interior administration, the public lands constitute a\r\nhighly important part. This is a subject of great interest, and it ought\r\nto attract much more attention than it has hitherto received, especially\r\nfrom the people of the Atlantic States. The public lands are public\r\nproperty. They belong to the people of all the States. A vast portion\r\nof them is composed of territories which were ceded by individual States\r\nto the United States, after the close of the Revolutionary war, and\r\nbefore the adoption of the present Constitution. The history of these\r\ncessions, and the reasons for making them, are familiar to you. Some of\r\nthe Old Thirteen possessed large tracts of unsettled lands within their\r\nchartered limits. The Revolution had established their title to these\r\nlands, and as the Revolution had been brought about by the common\r\ntreasure and the common blood of all the Colonies, it was thought not\r\nunreasonable that these unsettled lands should be transferred to the\r\nUnited States, to pay the debt created by the war, and afterwards to\r\nremain as a fund for the use of all the States. This is the well-known\r\norigin of the title possessed by the United States to lands northwest of\r\nthe River Ohio.\r\n\r\nBy treaties with France and Spain, Louisiana and Florida, containing\r\nmany millions of acres of public land, have been since acquired. The\r\ncost of these acquisitions was paid, of course, by the general\r\ngovernment, and was thus a charge upon the whole people. The public\r\nlands, therefore, all and singular, are national property; granted to\r\nthe United States, purchased by the United States, paid for by all the\r\npeople of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe idea, that, when a new State is created, the public lands lying\r\nwithin her territory become the property of such new State in\r\nconsequence of her sovereignty, is too preposterous for serious\r\nrefutation. Such notions have heretofore been advanced in Congress, but\r\nnobody has sustained them. They were rejected and abandoned, although\r\none cannot say whether they may not be revived, in consequence of recent\r\npropositions which have been made in the Senate. The new States are\r\nadmitted on express conditions, recognizing, to the fullest extent, the\r\nright of the United States to the public lands within their borders; and\r\nit is no more reasonable to contend that some indefinite idea of State\r\nsovereignty overrides all these stipulations, and makes the lands the\r\nproperty of the States, against the provisions and conditions of their\r\nown constitution, and the Constitution of the United States, than it\r\nwould be, that a similar doctrine entitled the State of New York to the\r\nmoney collected at the custom-house in this city; since it is no more\r\ninconsistent with sovereignty that one government should hold lands,\r\nfor the purpose of sale, within the territory of another, than it is\r\nthat it should lay and collect taxes and duties within such territory.\r\nWhatever extravagant pretensions may have been set up heretofore, there\r\nwas not, I suppose, an enlightened man in the whole West, who insisted\r\non any such right in the States, when the proposition to cede the lands\r\nto the States was made, in the late session of Congress. The public\r\nlands being, therefore the common property of all the people of all the\r\nStates, I shall never consent to give them away to particular States, or\r\nto dispose of them otherwise than for the general good, and the general\r\nuse of the whole country.\r\n\r\nI felt bound, therefore, on the occasion just alluded to, to resist at\r\nthe threshold a proposition to cede the public lands to the States in\r\nwhich they lie, on certain conditions. I very much regretted the\r\nintroduction of such a measure, as its effect must be, I fear, only to\r\nagitate what was well settled, and to disturb that course of proceeding\r\nin regard to the public lands, which forty years of experience have\r\nshown to be so wise, and so satisfactory in its operation, both to the\r\npeople of the old States and to those of the new.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, although the public lands are not to be given away, nor\r\nceded to particular States, a very liberal policy in regard to them\r\nought certainly to prevail. Such a policy has prevailed, and I have\r\nsteadily supported it, and shall continue to support it so long as I may\r\nremain in public life. The main object, in regard to these lands, is\r\nundoubtedly to settle them, so fast as the growth of our population, and\r\nits augmentation by emigration, may enable us to settle them.\r\n\r\nThe lands, therefore, should be sold, at a low price; and, for one, I\r\nhave never doubted the right or expediency of granting portions of the\r\nlands themselves, or of making grants of money, for objects of internal\r\nimprovement, connected with them.\r\n\r\nI have always supported liberal appropriations for the purpose of\r\nopening communications to and through these lands, by common roads,\r\ncanals, and railroads; and where lands of little value have been long in\r\nmarket, and, on account of their indifferent quality are not likely to\r\ncommand a common price, I know no objection to a reduction of price, as\r\nto such lands, so that they may pass into private ownership. Nor do I\r\nfeel any objections to removing those restraints which prevent the\r\nStates from taxing the lands for five years after they are sold. But\r\nwhile, in these and all other respects, I am not only reconciled to a\r\nliberal policy, but espouse it and support it, and have constantly done\r\nso, I still hold the national domain to be the general property of the\r\ncountry, confided to the care of Congress, and which Congress is\r\nsolemnly bound to protect and preserve for the common good.\r\n\r\nThe benefit derived from the public lands, after all, is, and must\r\nbe, in the greatest degree, enjoyed by those who buy them and settle\r\nupon them. The original price paid to government constitutes but a small\r\npart of their actual value. Their immediate rise in value, in the\r\nhands of the settler, gives him competence. He exercises a power of\r\nselection over a vast region of fertile territory, all on sale at the\r\nsame price, and that price an exceedingly low one. Selection is no\r\nsooner made, cultivation is no sooner begun, and the first furrow\r\nturned, than he already finds himself a man of property. These are the\r\nadvantages of Western emigrants and Western settlers; and they are\r\nsuch, certainly, as no country on earth ever before afforded to her\r\ncitizens. This opportunity of purchase and settlement, this certainty\r\nof enhanced value, these sure means of immediate competence and\r\nultimate wealth,--all these are the rights and the blessings of the\r\npeople of the West, and they have my hearty wishes for their full and\r\nperfect enjoyment.\r\n\r\nI desire to see the public lands cultivated and occupied. I desire the\r\ngrowth and prosperity of the West, and the fullest development of its\r\nvast and extraordinary resources. I wish to bring it near to us, by\r\nevery species of useful communication. I see, not without admiration and\r\namazement, but yet without envy or jealousy, States of recent origin\r\nalready containing more people than Massachusetts. These people I know\r\nto be part of ourselves; they have proceeded from the midst of us, and\r\nwe may trust that they are not likely to separate themselves, in\r\ninterest or in feeling, from their kindred, whom they have left on the\r\nfarms and around the hearths of their common fathers.\r\n\r\nA liberal policy, a sympathy with its interests, an enlightened and\r\ngenerous feeling of participation in its prosperity, are due to the\r\nWest, and will be met, I doubt not, by a return of sentiments equally\r\ncordial and equally patriotic.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, the general question of revenue is very much connected with\r\nthis subject of the public lands, and I will therefore, in a very few\r\nwords, express my views on that point.\r\n\r\nThe revenue involves not only the supply of the treasury with money, but\r\nthe question of protection to manufactures. On these connected subjects,\r\ntherefore, Gentlemen, as I have promised to keep nothing back, I will\r\nstate my opinions plainly, but very shortly.\r\n\r\nI am in favor of such a revenue as shall be equal to all the just and\r\nreasonable wants of the government; and I am decidedly opposed to all\r\ncollection or accumulation of revenue beyond this point. An extravagant\r\ngovernment expenditure, and unnecessary accumulation in the treasury,\r\nare both, of all things, to be most studiously avoided.\r\n\r\nI am in favor of protecting American industry and labor, not only as\r\nemployed in large manufactories, but also, and more especially, as\r\nemployed in the various mechanic arts, carried on by persons of small\r\ncapitals, and living by the earnings of their own personal industry.\r\nEvery city in the Union, and none more than this, would feel severely\r\nthe consequences of departing from the ancient and continued policy of\r\nthe government respecting this last branch of protection. If duties were\r\nto be abolished on hats, boots, shoes, and other articles of leather,\r\nand on the articles fabricated of brass, tin, and iron, and on\r\nready-made clothes, carriages, furniture, and many similar articles,\r\nthousands of persons would be immediately thrown out of employment in\r\nthis city, and in other parts of the Union. Protection, in this respect,\r\nof our own labor against the cheaper, ill-paid, half-fed, and pauper\r\nlabor of Europe, is, in my opinion, a duty which the country owes to its\r\nown citizens. I am, therefore, decidedly, for protecting our own\r\nindustry and our own labor.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, Gentlemen, I am of opinion, that, with no more than\r\nusual skill in the application of the well-tried principles of\r\ndiscriminating and specific duties, all the branches of national\r\nindustry may be protected, without imposing such duties on imports as\r\nshall overcharge the treasury.\r\n\r\nAnd as to the revenues arising from the sales of the public lands, I am\r\nof opinion that they ought to be set apart for the use of the States.\r\nThe States need the money. The government of the United States does not\r\nneed it. Many of the States have contracted large debts for objects of\r\ninternal improvement; and others of them have important objects which\r\nthey would wish to accomplish. The lands were originally granted for the\r\nuse of the several States; and now that their proceeds are not necessary\r\nfor the purposes of the general government, I am of opinion that they\r\nshould go to the States, and to the people of the States, upon an equal\r\nprinciple. Set apart, then, the proceeds of the public lands for the use\r\nof the States; supply the treasury from duties on imports; apply to\r\nthese duties a just and careful discrimination, in favor of articles\r\nproduced at home by our own labor, and thus support, to a fair extent,\r\nour own manufactures. These, Gentlemen, appear to me to be the general\r\noutlines of that policy which the present condition of the country\r\nrequires us to adopt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGentlemen, proposing to express opinions on the principal subjects of\r\ninterest at the present moment, it is impossible to overlook the\r\ndelicate question which has arisen from events which have happened in\r\nthe late Mexican province of Texas. The independence of that province\r\nhas now been recognized by the government of the United States. Congress\r\ngave the President the means, to be used when he saw fit, of opening a\r\ndiplomatic intercourse with its government, and the late President\r\nimmediately made use of those means.\r\n\r\nI saw no objection, under the circumstances, to voting an appropriation\r\nto be used when the President should think the proper time had come; and\r\nhe deemed, very promptly, it is true, that the time had already arrived.\r\nCertainly, Gentlemen, the history of Texas is not a little wonderful. A\r\nvery few people, in a very short time, have established a government for\r\nthemselves, against the authority of the parent state; and this\r\ngovernment, it is generally supposed, there is little probability, at\r\nthe present moment, of the parent state being able to overturn.\r\n\r\nThis government is, in form, a copy of our own. It is an American\r\nconstitution, substantially after the great American model. We all,\r\ntherefore, must wish it success; and there is no one who will more\r\nheartily rejoice than I shall, to see an independent community,\r\nintelligent, industrious, and friendly towards us, springing up, and\r\nrising into happiness, distinction, and power, upon our own principles\r\nof liberty and government.\r\n\r\nBut it cannot be disguised, Gentlemen, that a desire, or an intention,\r\nis already manifested to annex Texas to the United States. On a subject\r\nof such mighty magnitude as this, and at a moment when the public\r\nattention is drawn to it, I should feel myself wanting in candor, if I\r\ndid not express my opinion; since all must suppose that, on such a\r\nquestion, it is impossible that I should be without some opinion.\r\n\r\nI say then, Gentlemen, in all frankness, that I see objections, I think\r\ninsurmountable objections, to the annexation of Texas to the United\r\nStates. When the Constitution was formed, it is not probable that either\r\nits framers or the people ever looked to the admission of any States\r\ninto the Union, except such as then already existed, and such as should\r\nbe formed out of territories then already belonging to the United\r\nStates. Fifteen years after the adoption of the Constitution, however,\r\nthe case of Louisiana arose. Louisiana was obtained by treaty with\r\nFrance, who had recently obtained it from Spain; but the object of this\r\nacquisition, certainly, was not mere extension of territory. Other great\r\npolitical interests were connected with it. Spain, while she possessed\r\nLouisiana, had held the mouths of the great rivers which rise in the\r\nWestern States, and flow into the Gulf of Mexico. She had disputed our\r\nuse of these rivers already, and with a powerful nation in possession of\r\nthese outlets to the sea, it is obvious that the commerce of all the\r\nWest was in danger of perpetual vexation. The command of these rivers to\r\nthe sea was, therefore, the great object aimed at in the acquisition of\r\nLouisiana. But that acquisition necessarily brought territory along with\r\nit, and three States now exist, formed out of that ancient province.\r\n\r\nA similar policy, and a similar necessity, though perhaps not entirely\r\nso urgent, led to the acquisition of Florida.\r\n\r\nNow, no such necessity, no such policy, requires the annexation of\r\nTexas. The accession of Texas to our territory is not necessary to the\r\nfull and complete enjoyment of all which we already possess. Her case,\r\ntherefore, stands upon a footing entirely different from that of\r\nLouisiana and Florida. There being no necessity for extending the limits\r\nof the Union in that direction, we ought, I think, for numerous and\r\npowerful reasons, to be content with our present boundaries.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, we all see that, by whomsoever possessed, Texas is likely to\r\nbe a slave-holding country; and I frankly avow my entire unwillingness\r\nto do any thing that shall extend the slavery of the African race on\r\nthis continent, or add other slave-holding States to the Union. When I\r\nsay that I regard slavery in itself as a great moral, social, and\r\npolitical evil, I only use language which has been adopted by\r\ndistinguished men, themselves citizens of slave-holding States. I shall\r\ndo nothing, therefore, to favor or encourage its further extension. We\r\nhave slavery already amongst us. The Constitution found it in the Union;\r\nit recognized it, and gave it solemn guaranties. To the full extent of\r\nthese guaranties we are all bound, in honor, in justice, and by the\r\nConstitution. All the stipulations contained in the Constitution in\r\nfavor of the slave-holding States which are already in the Union ought\r\nto be fulfilled, and, so far as depends on me, shall be fulfilled, in\r\nthe fullness of their spirit and to the exactness of their letter.\r\nSlavery, as it exists in the States, is beyond the reach of Congress. It\r\nis a concern of the States themselves; they have never submitted it to\r\nCongress, and Congress has no rightful power over it. I shall concur,\r\ntherefore, in no act, no measure, no menace, no indication of purpose,\r\nwhich shall interfere or threaten to interfere with the exclusive\r\nauthority of the several States over the subject of slavery as it exists\r\nwithin their respective limits. All this appears to me to be matter of\r\nplain and imperative duty.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to speak of admitting new States, the subject assumes\r\nan entirely different aspect. Our rights and our duties are then both\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nThe free States, and all the States, are then at liberty to accept or to\r\nreject. When it is proposed to bring new members into this political\r\npartnership, the old members have a right to say on what terms such new\r\npartners are to come in, and what they are to bring along with them. In\r\nmy opinion, the people of the United States will not consent to bring\r\ninto the Union a new, vastly extensive, and slave-holding country, large\r\nenough for half a dozen or a dozen States. In my opinion, they ought not\r\nto consent to it. Indeed, I am altogether at a loss to conceive what\r\npossible benefit any part of this country can expect to derive from such\r\nannexation. Any benefit to any part is at least doubtful and uncertain;\r\nthe objections are obvious, plain, and strong. On the general question\r\nof slavery, a great portion of the community is already strongly\r\nexcited. The subject has not only attracted attention as a question of\r\npolitics, but it has struck a far deeper-toned chord. It has arrested\r\nthe religious feeling of the country; it has taken strong hold on the\r\nconsciences of men. He is a rash man, indeed, and little conversant with\r\nhuman nature, and especially has he a very erroneous estimate of the\r\ncharacter of the people of this country, who supposes that a feeling of\r\nthis kind is to be trifled with or despised. It will assuredly cause\r\nitself to be respected. It may be reasoned with, it may be made willing,\r\nI believe it is entirely willing, to fulfil all existing engagements and\r\nall existing duties, to uphold and defend the Constitution as it is\r\nestablished, with whatever regrets about some provisions which it does\r\nactually contain. But to coerce it into silence, to endeavor to restrain\r\nits free expression, to seek to compress and confine it, warm as it is,\r\nand more heated as such endeavors would inevitably render it,--should\r\nthis be attempted, I know nothing, even in the Constitution or in the\r\nUnion itself, which would not be endangered by the explosion which might\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nI see, therefore, no political necessity for the annexation of Texas to\r\nthe Union; no advantages to be derived from it; and objections to it of\r\na strong, and, in my judgment, decisive character.\r\n\r\nI believe it to be for the interest and happiness of the whole Union to\r\nremain as it is, without diminution and without addition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGentleman, I pass to other subjects. The rapid advancement of the\r\nexecutive authority is a topic which has already been alluded to.\r\n\r\nI believe there is serious cause of alarm from this source. I believe\r\nthe power of the executive has increased, is increasing, and ought\r\nnow to be brought back within its ancient constitutional limits. I\r\nhave nothing to do with the motives which have led to those acts,\r\nwhich I believe to have transcended the boundaries of the Constitution.\r\nGood motives may always be assumed, as bad motives may always be\r\nimputed. Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption\r\nof power; but they cannot justify it, even if we were sure that they\r\nexisted. It is hardly too strong to say, that the Constitution was\r\nmade to guard the people against the dangers of good intention,\r\nreal or pretended. When bad intentions are boldly avowed, the people\r\nwill promptly take care of themselves. On the other hand, they will\r\nalways be asked why they should resist or question that exercise of\r\npower which is so fair in its object, so plausible and patriotic in\r\nappearance, and which has the public good alone confessedly in view?\r\nHuman beings, we may be assured, will generally exercise power when\r\nthey can get it; and they will exercise it most undoubtedly, in\r\npopular governments, under pretences of public safety or high public\r\ninterest. It may be very possible that good intentions do really\r\nsometimes exist when constitutional restraints are disregarded. There\r\nare men, in all ages, who mean to exercise power usefully; but who\r\nmean to exercise it. They mean to govern well; but they mean to\r\ngovern. They promise to be kind masters; but they mean to be masters.\r\nThey think there need be but little restraint upon themselves. Their\r\nnotion of the public interest is apt to be quite closely connected\r\nwith their own exercise of authority. They may not, indeed, always\r\nunderstand their own motives. The love of power may sink too deep in\r\ntheir own hearts even for their own scrutiny, and may pass with\r\nthemselves for mere patriotism and benevolence.\r\n\r\nA character has been drawn of a very eminent citizen of Massachusetts,\r\nof the last age, which, though I think it does not entirely belong to\r\nhim, yet very well describes a certain class of public men. It was said\r\nof this distinguished son of Massachusetts, that in matters of politics\r\nand government he cherished the most kind and benevolent feelings\r\ntowards the whole earth. He earnestly desired to see all nations well\r\ngoverned; and to bring about this happy result, he wished that the\r\nUnited States might govern the rest of the world; that Massachusetts\r\nmight govern the United States; that Boston might govern Massachusetts;\r\nand as for himself, his own humble ambition would be satisfied by\r\ngoverning the little town of Boston.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI do not intend, Gentlemen, to commit so unreasonable a trespass on your\r\npatience as to discuss all those cases in which I think executive power\r\nhas been unreasonably extended. I shall only allude to some of them,\r\nand, as being earliest in the order of time, and hardly second to any\r\nother in importance, I mention the practice of removal from all\r\noffices, high and low, for opinion's sake, and on the avowed ground of\r\ngiving patronage to the President; that is to say, of giving him the\r\npower of influencing men's political opinions and political conduct, by\r\nhopes and by fears addressed directly to their pecuniary interests. The\r\ngreat battle on this point was fought, and was lost, in the Senate of\r\nthe United States, in the last session of Congress under Mr. Adams's\r\nadministration. After General Jackson was known to be elected, and\r\nbefore his term of office began, many important offices became vacant,\r\nby the usual causes of death and resignation. Mr. Adams, of course,\r\nnominated persons to fill these vacant offices. But a majority of the\r\nSenate was composed of the friends of General Jackson; and, instead of\r\nacting on these nominations, and filling the vacant offices with\r\nordinary promptitude, the nominations were postponed to a day beyond the\r\n4th of March, for the purpose, openly avowed, of giving the patronage of\r\nthe appointments to the President who was then coming into office. When\r\nthe new President entered on his office, he withdrew these nominations,\r\nand sent in nominations of his own friends in their places. I was of\r\nopinion then, and am of opinion now, that that decision of the Senate\r\nwent far to unfix the proper balance of the government. It conferred on\r\nthe President the power of rewards for party purposes, or personal\r\npurposes, without limit or control. It sanctioned, manifestly and\r\nplainly, that exercise of power which Mr. Madison had said would deserve\r\nimpeachment; and it completely defeated one great object, which we are\r\ntold the framers of the Constitution contemplated, in the manner of\r\nforming the Senate; that is, that the Senate might be a body not\r\nchanging with the election of a President, and therefore likely to be\r\nable to hold over him some check or restraint in regard to bringing his\r\nown friends and partisans into power with him, and thus rewarding their\r\nservices to him at the public expense.\r\n\r\nThe debates in the Senate, on these questions, were long continued and\r\nearnest. They were of course in secret session, but the opinions of\r\nthose members who opposed this course have all been proved true by the\r\nresult. The contest was severe and ardent, as much so as any that I have\r\never partaken in; and I have seen some service in that sort of warfare.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, when I look back to that eventful moment, when I remember who\r\nthose were who upheld this claim for executive power, with so much zeal\r\nand devotion, as well as with such great and splendid abilities, and\r\nwhen I look round now, and inquire what has become of these gentlemen,\r\nwhere they have found themselves at last, under the power which they\r\nthus helped to establish, what has become now of all their respect,\r\ntrust, confidence, and attachment, how many of them, indeed, have not\r\nescaped from being broken and crushed under the weight of the wheels of\r\nthat engine which they themselves set in motion. I feel that an edifying\r\nlesson may be read by those who, in the freshness and fullness of party\r\nzeal, are ready to confer the most dangerous power, in the hope that\r\nthey and their friends may bask in its sunshine, while enemies only\r\nshall be withered by its frown.\r\n\r\nI will not go into the mention of names. I will give no enumeration of\r\npersons; but I ask you to turn your minds back, and recollect who the\r\ndistinguished men were who supported, in the Senate, General Jackson's\r\nadministration for the first two years; and I will ask you what you\r\nsuppose they think now of that power and that discretion which they so\r\nfreely confided to executive hands. What do they think of the whole\r\ncareer of that administration, the commencement of which, and indeed the\r\nexistence of which, owed so much to their own great exertions?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn addition to the establishment of this power of unlimited and\r\ncauseless removal, another doctrine has been put forth, more vague, it\r\nis true, but altogether unconstitutional, and tending to like dangerous\r\nresults. In some loose, indefinite, and unknown sense, the President has\r\nbeen called the _representative of the whole American people_. He has\r\ncalled himself so repeatedly, and been so denominated by his friends a\r\nthousand times. Acts, for which no specific authority has been found\r\neither in the Constitution or the laws, have been justified on the\r\nground that the President is the representative of the whole American\r\npeople. Certainly, this is not constitutional language. Certainly, the\r\nConstitution nowhere calls the President the universal representative of\r\nthe people. The constitutional representatives of the people are in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, exercising powers of legislation. The\r\nPresident is an executive officer, appointed in a particular manner, and\r\nclothed with prescribed and limited powers. It may be thought to be of\r\nno great consequence, that the President should call himself, or that\r\nothers should call him, the sole representative of all the people,\r\nalthough he has no such appellation or character in the Constitution.\r\nBut, in these matters, words are things. If he is the people's\r\nrepresentative, and as such may exercise power, without any other grant,\r\nwhat is the limit to that power? And what may not an unlimited\r\nrepresentative of the people do? When the Constitution expressly creates\r\nrepresentatives, as members of Congress, it regulates, defines, and\r\nlimits their authority. But if the executive chief magistrate, merely\r\nbecause he is the executive chief magistrate, may assume to himself\r\nanother character, and call himself the representative of the whole\r\npeople, what is to limit or restrain this representative power in his\r\nhands?\r\n\r\nI fear, Gentlemen, that if these pretensions should be continued and\r\njustified, we might have many instances of summary political logic, such\r\nas I once heard in the House of Representatives. A gentleman, not now\r\nliving, wished very much to vote for the establishment of a Bank of the\r\nUnited States, but he had always stoutly denied the constitutional power\r\nof Congress to create such a bank. The country, however, was in a state\r\nof great financial distress, from which such an institution, it was\r\nhoped, might help to extricate it; and this consideration led the worthy\r\nmember to review his opinions with care and deliberation. Happily, on\r\nsuch careful and deliberate review, he altered his former judgment. He\r\ncame, satisfactorily, to the conclusion that Congress might incorporate\r\na bank. The argument which brought his mind to this result was short,\r\nand so plain and obvious, that he wondered how he should so long have\r\noverlooked it. The power, he said, to create a bank, was either given to\r\nCongress, or it was not given. Very well. If it was given, Congress of\r\ncourse could exercise it; if it was not given, the people still retained\r\nit, and in that case, Congress, as the representatives of the people,\r\nmight, upon an emergency, make free to use it.\r\n\r\nArguments and conclusions in substance like these, Gentlemen, will not\r\nbe wanting, if men of great popularity, commanding characters, sustained\r\nby powerful parties, _and full of good intentions towards the public_,\r\nmay be permitted to call themselves the universal representatives of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, it is the _currency_, the currency of the country,--it\r\nis this great subject, so interesting, so vital, to all classes of the\r\ncommunity, which has been destined to feel the most violent assaults of\r\nexecutive power. The consequences are around us and upon us. Not\r\nunforeseen, not unforetold, here they come, bringing distress for the\r\npresent, and fear and alarm for the future. If it be denied that the\r\npresent condition of things has arisen from the President's interference\r\nwith the revenue, the first answer is, that, when he did interfere, just\r\nsuch consequences were predicted. It was then said, and repeated, and\r\npressed upon the public attention, that that interference must\r\nnecessarily produce derangement, embarrassment, loss of confidence, and\r\ncommercial distress. I pray you, Gentlemen, to recur to the debates of\r\n1832, 1833, and 1834, and then to decide whose opinions have proved to\r\nbe correct. When the treasury experiment was first announced, who\r\nsupported, and who opposed it? Who warned the country against it? Who\r\nwere they who endeavored to stay the violence of party, to arrest the\r\nhand of executive authority, and to convince the people that this\r\nexperiment was delusive; that its object was merely to increase\r\nexecutive power, and that its effect, sooner or later, must be injurious\r\nand ruinous? Gentlemen, it is fair to bring the opinions of political\r\nmen to the test of experience. It is just to judge of them by their\r\nmeasures, and their opposition to measures; and for myself, and those\r\npolitical friends with whom I have acted, on this subject of the\r\ncurrency, I am ready to abide the test.\r\n\r\nBut before the subject of the currency, and its present most\r\nembarrassing state, is discussed, I invite your attention, Gentlemen, to\r\nthe history of executive proceedings connected with it. I propose to\r\nstate to you a series of facts; not to argue upon them, not to _mystify_\r\nthem, nor to draw any unjust inference from them; but merely to state\r\nthe case, in the plainest manner, as I understand it. And I wish,\r\nGentlemen, that, in order to be able to do this in the best and most\r\nconvincing manner, I had the ability of my learned friend, (Mr. Ogden,)\r\nwhom you have all so often heard, and who usually states his case in\r\nsuch a manner that, when stated, it is already very well argued.\r\n\r\nLet us see, Gentlemen, what the train of occurrences has been in regard\r\nto our revenue and finances; and when these occurrences are stated, I\r\nleave to every man the right to decide for himself whether our present\r\ndifficulties have or have not arisen from attempts to extend the\r\nexecutive authority. In giving this detail, I shall be compelled to\r\nspeak of the late Bank of the United States; but I shall speak of it\r\nhistorically only. My opinion of its utility, and of the extraordinary\r\nability and success with which its affairs were conducted for many years\r\nbefore the termination of its charter, is well known. I have often\r\nexpressed it, and I have not altered it. But at present I speak of the\r\nbank only as it makes a necessary part in the history of events which I\r\nwish now to recapitulate.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams commenced his administration in March, 1825. He had been\r\nelected by the House of Representatives, and began his career as\r\nPresident under a powerful opposition. From the very first day, he\r\nwas warmly, even violently, opposed in all his measures; and this\r\nopposition, as we all know, continued without abatement, either in\r\nforce or asperity, through his whole term of four years. Gentlemen, I\r\nam not about to say whether this opposition was well or ill founded,\r\njust or unjust. I only state the fact as connected with other facts.\r\nThe Bank of the United States, during these four years of Mr. Adams's\r\nadministration, was in full operation. It was performing the fiscal\r\nduties enjoined on it by its charter; it had established numerous\r\noffices, was maintaining a large circulation, and transacting a vast\r\nbusiness in exchange. Its character, conduct, and manner of\r\nadministration were all well known to the whole country.\r\n\r\nNow there are two or three things worthy of especial notice. One is,\r\nthat during the whole of this heated political controversy, from\r\n1825 to 1829, the party which was endeavoring to produce a change of\r\nadministration in the general government brought no charge of political\r\ninterference against the Bank of the United States. If any thing, it\r\nwas rather a favorite with that party generally. Certainly, the party,\r\nas a party, did not ascribe to it undue attachment to other parties,\r\nor to the then existing administration. Another important fact is,\r\nthat, during the whole of the same period, those who had espoused the\r\ncause of General Jackson, and who sought to bring about a revolution\r\nunder his name, did not propose the destruction of the bank, or its\r\ndiscontinuance, as one of the objects which were to be accomplished\r\nby the intended revolution. They did not tell the country that the bank\r\nwas unconstitutional; they did not declare it unnecessary; they did not\r\npropose to get along without it, when they should come into power\r\nthemselves. If individuals entertained any such purposes, they kept them\r\nmuch to themselves. The party, as a party, avowed none such. A third\r\nfact, worthy of all notice, is, that during this period there was no\r\ncomplaint about the state of the currency, either by the country\r\ngenerally or by the party then in opposition.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1829, General Jackson was inaugurated as President. He came\r\ninto power on professions of reform. He announced reform of all abuses\r\nto be the great and leading object of his future administration; and in\r\nhis inaugural address he pointed out the main subjects of this reform.\r\nBut the bank was not one of them. It was not said by him that the bank\r\nwas unconstitutional. It was not said that it was unnecessary or\r\nuseless. It was not said that it had failed to do all that had been\r\nhoped or expected from it in regard to the currency.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1829, then, the bank stood well, very well, with the new\r\nadministration. It was regarded, so far as appears, as entirely\r\nconstitutional, free from political or party taint, and highly useful.\r\nIt had as yet found no place in the catalogue of abuses to be reformed.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, nine months wrought a wonderful change. New lights broke\r\nforth before these months had rolled away; and the President, in his\r\nmessage to Congress in December, 1829, held a very unaccustomed language\r\nand manifested very unexpected purposes.\r\n\r\nAlthough the bank had then five or six years of its charter unexpired,\r\nhe yet called the attention of Congress very pointedly to the subject,\r\nand declared,--\r\n\r\n1. That the constitutionality of the bank was well doubted by many;\r\n\r\n2. That its utility or expediency was also well doubted;\r\n\r\n3. That all must admit that it had failed to establish or maintain a\r\nsound and uniform currency; and\r\n\r\n4. That the true bank for the use of the government of the United States\r\nwould be a bank which should be founded on the revenues and credit of\r\nthe government itself.\r\n\r\nThese propositions appeared to me, at the time, as very extraordinary,\r\nand the last one as very startling. A bank founded on the revenue and\r\ncredit of the government, and managed and administered by the executive,\r\nwas a conception which I had supposed no man holding the chief executive\r\npower in his own hands would venture to put forth.\r\n\r\nBut the question now is, what had wrought this great change of feeling\r\nand of purpose in regard to the bank. What events had occurred between\r\nMarch and December that should have caused the bank, so constitutional,\r\nso useful, so peaceful, and so safe an institution, in the first of\r\nthese months, to start up into the character of a monster, and become so\r\nhorrid and dangerous, in the last?\r\n\r\nGentlemen, let us see what the events were which had intervened. General\r\nJackson was elected in December, 1828. His term was to begin in March,\r\n1829. A session of Congress took place, therefore, between his election\r\nand the commencement of his administration.\r\n\r\nNow, Gentlemen, the truth is, that during this session, and a little\r\nbefore the commencement of the new administration, a disposition was\r\nmanifested by political men to interfere with the management of the\r\nbank. Members of Congress undertook to nominate or recommend individuals\r\nas directors in the branches, or offices, of the bank. They were kind\r\nenough, sometimes, to make out whole lists, or tickets, and to send them\r\nto Philadelphia, containing the names of those whose appointments would\r\nbe satisfactory to General Jackson's friends. Portions of the\r\ncorrespondence on these subjects have been published in some of the\r\nvoluminous reports and other documents connected with the bank, but\r\nperhaps have not been generally heeded or noticed. At first, the bank\r\nmerely declined, as gently as possible, complying with these and similar\r\nrequests. But like applications began to show themselves from many\r\nquarters, and a very marked case arose as early as June, 1829. Certain\r\nmembers of the Legislature of New Hampshire applied for a change in the\r\npresidency of the branch which was established in that State. A member\r\nof the Senate of the United States wrote both to the president of the\r\nbank and to the Secretary of the Treasury, strongly recommending a\r\nchange, and in his letter to the Secretary hinting very distinctly at\r\npolitical considerations as the ground of the movement. Other officers\r\nin the service of the government took an interest in the matter, and\r\nurged a change; and the Secretary himself wrote to the bank, suggesting\r\nand recommending it. The time had come, then, for the bank to take its\r\nposition. It did take it; and, in my judgment, if it had not acted as it\r\ndid act, not only would those who had the care of it have been most\r\nhighly censurable, but a claim would have been yielded to, entirely\r\ninconsistent with a government of laws, and subversive of the very\r\nfoundations of republicanism.\r\n\r\nA long correspondence between the Secretary of the Treasury and the\r\npresident of the bank ensued. The directors determined that they\r\nwould not surrender either their rights or their duties to the\r\ncontrol or supervision of the executive government. They said they had\r\nnever appointed directors of their branches on political grounds, and\r\nthey would not remove them on such grounds. They had avoided politics.\r\nThey had sought for men of business, capacity, fidelity, and experience\r\nin the management of pecuniary concerns. They owed duties, they said,\r\nto the government, which they meant to perform, faithfully and\r\nimpartially, under all administrations; and they owed duties to the\r\nstockholders of the bank, which required them to disregard political\r\nconsiderations in their appointments. This correspondence ran along\r\ninto the fall of the year, and finally terminated in a stern and\r\nunanimous declaration, made by the directors, and transmitted to the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, that the bank would continue to be\r\nindependently administered, and that the directors once for all refused\r\nto submit to the supervision of the executive authority, in any of\r\nits branches, in the appointment of local directors and agents. This\r\nresolution decided the character of the future. Hostility towards the\r\nbank, thenceforward, became the settled policy of the government; and\r\nthe message of December, 1829, was the clear announcement of that\r\npolicy. If the bank had appointed those directors, thus recommended by\r\nmembers of Congress; if it had submitted all its appointments to the\r\nsupervision of the treasury; if it had removed the president of the\r\nNew Hampshire branch; if it had, in all things, showed itself a\r\ncomplying, political, party machine, instead of an independent\r\ninstitution;--if it had done this, I leave all men to judge whether such\r\nan entire change of opinion, as to its constitutionality, its utility,\r\nand its good effects on the currency, would have happened between\r\nMarch and December.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment in which the bank asserted its independence of treasury\r\ncontrol, and its elevation above mere party purposes, down to the end of\r\nits charter, and down even to the present day, it has been the subject\r\nto which the selectest phrases of party denunciation have been\r\nplentifully applied.\r\n\r\nBut Congress manifested no disposition to establish a treasury bank.\r\nOn the contrary, it was satisfied, and so was the country, most\r\nunquestionably, with the bank then existing. In the summer of 1832,\r\nCongress passed an act for continuing the charter of the bank, by\r\nstrong majorities in both houses. In the House of Representatives, I\r\nthink, two thirds of the members voted for the bill. The President\r\ngave it his negative; and as there were not two thirds of the\r\nSenate, though a large majority were for it, the bill failed to become\r\na law.\r\n\r\nBut it was not enough that a continuance of the charter of the bank was\r\nthus refused. It had the deposit of the public money, and this it was\r\nentitled to by law, for the few years which yet remained of its\r\nchartered term. But this it was determined it should not continue to\r\nenjoy. At the commencement of the session of 1832-33, a grave and sober\r\ndoubt was expressed by the Secretary of the Treasury, in his official\r\ncommunication, whether the public moneys were safe in the custody of the\r\nbank! I confess, Gentlemen, when I look back to this suggestion, thus\r\nofficially made, so serious in its import, so unjust, if not well\r\nfounded, and so greatly injurious to the credit of the bank, and\r\ninjurious, indeed, to the credit of the whole country, I cannot but\r\nwonder that any man of intelligence and character should have been\r\nwilling to make it. I read in it, however, the first lines of another\r\nchapter. I saw an attempt was now to be made to remove the deposits of\r\nthe public money from the bank, and such an attempt was made that very\r\nsession. But Congress was not to be prevailed upon to accomplish the end\r\nby its own authority. It was well ascertained that neither house would\r\nconsent to it. The House of Representatives, indeed, at the heel of the\r\nsession, decided against the proposition by a very large majority.\r\n\r\nThe legislative authority having been thus invoked, and invoked in vain,\r\nit was resolved to stretch farther the long arm of executive power, and\r\nby that arm to reach and strike the victim. It so happened that I was in\r\nthis city in May, 1833, and here learned, from a very authentic source,\r\nthat the deposits would be removed by the President's order; and in\r\nJune, as afterwards appeared, that order was given.\r\n\r\nNow it is obvious, Gentlemen, that thus far the changes in our financial\r\nand fiscal system were effected, not by Congress, but by the executive;\r\nnot by law, but by the will and the power of the President. Congress\r\nwould have continued the charter of the bank; but the President\r\nnegatived the bill. Congress was of opinion that the deposits ought not\r\nto be removed; but the President removed them. Nor was this all. The\r\npublic moneys being withdrawn from the custody which the law had\r\nprovided, by executive power alone, that same power selected the places\r\nfor their future keeping. Particular banks, existing under State\r\ncharters, were chosen. With these especial and particular arrangements\r\nwere made, and the public moneys were deposited in their vaults.\r\nHenceforward these selected banks were to operate on the revenue and\r\ncredit of the government; and thus the original scheme, promulgated in\r\nthe annual message of December, 1829, was substantially carried into\r\neffect. Here were banks chosen by the treasury; all the arrangements\r\nwith them made by the treasury; a set of duties to be performed by them\r\nto the treasury prescribed; and these banks were to hold the whole\r\nproceeds of the public revenue. In all this, Congress had neither part\r\nnor lot. No law had caused the removal of the deposits; no law had\r\nauthorized the selection of deposit State banks; no law had prescribed\r\nthe terms on which the revenues should be placed in such banks. From the\r\nbeginning of the chapter to the end, it was all executive edict. And\r\nnow, Gentlemen, I ask if it be not most remarkable, that, in a country\r\nprofessing to be under a government of laws, such great and important\r\nchanges in one of its most essential and vital interests should be\r\nbrought about without any change of law, without any enactment of the\r\nlegislature whatever? Is such a power trusted to the executive of any\r\ngovernment in which the executive is separated, by clear and\r\nwell-defined lines, from the legislative department? The currency of the\r\ncountry stands on the same general ground as the commerce of the\r\ncountry. Both are intimately connected, and both are subjects of legal,\r\nnot of executive, regulation.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice, that the writers of the Federalist, in\r\ndiscussing the powers which the Constitution conferred on the President,\r\nmade it matter of commendation, that it withdraws this subject\r\naltogether from his grasp. \"He can prescribe no rules,\" say they,\r\n\"concerning the commerce or _currency_ of the country.\" And so we have\r\nbeen all taught to think, under all former administrations. But we have\r\nnow seen that the President, and the President alone, does prescribe the\r\nrule concerning the currency. He makes it, and he alters it. He makes\r\none rule for one branch of the revenue, and another rule for another. He\r\nmakes one rule for the citizen of one State, and another for the citizen\r\nof another State. This, it is certain, is one part of the treasury order\r\nof July last.\r\n\r\nBut at last Congress interfered, and undertook to regulate the deposits\r\nof the public moneys. It passed the law of July, 1836, placing the\r\nsubject under legal control, restraining the power of the executive,\r\nsubjecting the banks to liabilities and duties, on the one hand, and\r\nsecuring them against executive favoritism, on the other. But this law\r\ncontained another important provision; which was, that all the money in\r\nthe treasury, beyond what was necessary for the current expenditures of\r\nthe government, should be deposited with the States. This measure passed\r\nboth houses by very unusual majorities, yet it hardly escaped a veto. It\r\nobtained only a cold assent, a slow, reluctant, and hesitating approval;\r\nand an early moment was seized to array against it a long list of\r\nobjections. But the law passed. The money in the treasury beyond the sum\r\nof five millions was to go to the States. It has so gone, and the\r\ntreasury for the present is relieved from the burden of a surplus. But\r\nnow observe other coincidences. In the annual message of December, 1835,\r\nthe President quoted the fact of the rapidly increasing sale of the\r\npublic lands as proof of high national prosperity. He alluded to that\r\nsubject, certainly with much satisfaction, and apparently in something\r\nof the tone of exultation. There was nothing said about monopoly, not a\r\nword about speculation, not a word about over-issues of paper, to pay\r\nfor the lands. All was prosperous, all was full of evidence of a wise\r\nadministration of government, all was joy and triumph.\r\n\r\nBut the idea of a deposit or distribution of the surplus money with the\r\npeople suddenly damped this effervescing happiness. The color of the\r\nrose was gone, and every thing now looked gloomy and black. Now no more\r\nfelicitation or congratulation, on account of the rapid sales of the\r\npublic lands; no more of this most decisive proof of national prosperity\r\nand happiness. The executive Muse takes up a melancholy strain. She\r\nsings of monopolies, of speculation, of worthless paper, of loss both of\r\nland and money, of the multiplication of banks, and the danger of paper\r\nissues; and the end of the canto, the catastrophe, is, that lands shall\r\nno longer be sold but for gold and silver alone. The object of all this\r\nis clear enough. It was to diminish the income from the public lands. No\r\ndesire for such a diminution had been manifested, so long as the money\r\nwas supposed to be likely to remain in the treasury. But a growing\r\nconviction that some other disposition must be made of the surplus,\r\nawakened attention to the means of preventing that surplus.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the last session, Gentlemen, a proposition was\r\nbrought forward in Congress for such an alteration of the law as should\r\nadmit payment for public lands to be made in nothing but gold and\r\nsilver. The mover voted for his own proposition; but I do not recollect\r\nthat any other member concurred in the vote. The proposition was\r\nrejected at once; but, as in other cases, that which Congress refused to\r\ndo, the executive power did. Ten days after Congress adjourned, having\r\nhad this matter before it, and having refused to act upon it by making\r\nany alteration in the existing laws, a treasury order was issued,\r\ncommanding that very thing to be done which Congress had been requested\r\nand had refused to do. Just as in the case of the removal of the\r\ndeposits, the executive power acted in this case also against the known,\r\nwell understood, and recently expressed will of the representatives of\r\nthe people. There never has been a moment when the legislative will\r\nwould have sanctioned the object of that order; probably never a moment\r\nin which any twenty individual members of Congress would have concurred\r\nin it. The act was done without the assent of Congress, and against the\r\nwell-known opinion of Congress. That act altered the law of the land, or\r\npurported to alter it, against the well-known will of the law-making\r\npower.\r\n\r\nFor one, I confess I see no authority whatever in the Constitution, or\r\nin any law, for this treasury order. Those who have undertaken to\r\nmaintain it have placed it on grounds, not only different, but\r\ninconsistent and contradictory. The reason which one gives, another\r\nrejects; one confutes what another argues. With one it is the joint\r\nresolution of 1816 which gave the authority; with another, it is the law\r\nof 1820; with a third, it is the general superintending power of the\r\nPresident; and this last argument, since it resolves itself into mere\r\npower, without stopping to point out the sources of that power, is not\r\nonly the shortest, but in truth the most just. He is the most sensible,\r\nas well as the most candid reasoner, in my opinion, who places this\r\ntreasury order on the ground of the pleasure of the executive, and stops\r\nthere. I regard the joint resolution of 1816 as mandatory; as\r\nprescribing a legal rule; as putting this subject, in which all have so\r\ndeep an interest, beyond the caprice, or the arbitrary pleasure, or the\r\ndiscretion, of the Secretary of the Treasury. I believe there is not the\r\nslightest legal authority, either in that officer or in the President,\r\nto make a distinction, and to say that paper may be received for debts\r\nat the custom-house, but that gold and silver only shall be received at\r\nthe land offices. And now for the sequel.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the last session, as you know, Gentlemen, a\r\nresolution was brought forward in the Senate for annulling and\r\nabrogating this order, by Mr. Ewing, of Ohio, a gentleman of much\r\nintelligence, of sound principles, of vigorous and energetic character,\r\nwhose loss from the service of the country I regard as a public\r\nmisfortune. The Whig members all supported this resolution, and all the\r\nmembers, I believe, with the exception of some five or six, were very\r\nanxious in some way to get rid of the treasury order. But Mr. Ewing's\r\nresolution was too direct. It was deemed a pointed and ungracious attack\r\non executive polity. It must therefore be softened, modified, qualified,\r\nmade to sound less harsh to the ears of men in power, and to assume a\r\nplausible, polished, inoffensive character. It was accordingly put into\r\nthe plastic hands of friends of the executive to be moulded and\r\nfashioned, so that it might have the effect of ridding the country of\r\nthe obnoxious order, and yet not appear to question executive\r\ninfallibility. All this did not answer. The late President is not a man\r\nto be satisfied with soft words; and he saw in the measure, even as it\r\npassed the two houses, a substantial repeal of the order. He is a man of\r\nboldness and decision; and he respects boldness and decision in others.\r\nIf you are his friend, he expects no flinching; and if you are his\r\nadversary, he respects you none the less for carrying your opposition to\r\nthe full limits of honorable warfare. Gentlemen, I most sincerely regret\r\nthe course of the President in regard to this bill, and certainly most\r\nhighly disapprove it. But I do not suffer the mortification of having\r\nattempted to disguise and garnish it, in order to make it acceptable,\r\nand of still finding it thrown back in my face. All that was obtained by\r\nthis ingenious, diplomatic, and over-courteous mode of enacting a law,\r\nwas a response from the President and the Attorney-General, that the\r\nbill in question was obscure, ill penned, and not easy to be understood.\r\nThe bill, therefore, was neither approved nor negatived. If it had been\r\napproved, the treasury order would have been annulled, though in a\r\nclumsy and objectionable manner. If it had been negatived, and returned\r\nto Congress, no doubt it would have been passed by two thirds of both\r\nhouses, and in that way have become a law, and abrogated the order. But\r\nit was not approved, it was not returned; it was retained. It had passed\r\nthe Senate in season; it had been sent to the House in season; but there\r\nit was suffered to lie so long without being called up, that it was\r\ncompletely in the power of the President when it finally passed that\r\nbody; since he is not obliged to return bills which he does not approve,\r\nif not presented to him ten days before the end of the session. The bill\r\nwas lost, therefore, and the treasury order remains in force. Here again\r\nthe representatives of the people, in both houses of Congress, by\r\nmajorities almost unprecedented, endeavored to abolish this obnoxious\r\norder. On hardly any subject, indeed, has opinion been so unanimous,\r\neither in or out of Congress. Yet the order remains.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Gentlemen, I ask you, and I ask all men who have not\r\nvoluntarily surrendered all power and all right of thinking for\r\nthemselves, whether, from 1832 to the present moment, the executive\r\nauthority has not effectually superseded the power of Congress, thwarted\r\nthe will of the representatives of the people, and even of the people\r\nthemselves, and taken the whole subject of the currency into its own\r\ngrasp? In 1832, Congress desired to continue the bank of the United\r\nStates, and a majority of the people desired it also; but the President\r\nopposed it, and his will prevailed. In 1833, Congress refused to remove\r\nthe deposits; the President resolved upon it, however, and his will\r\nprevailed. Congress has never been willing to make a bank founded on the\r\nmoney and credit of the government, and administered, of course, by\r\nexecutive hands; but this was the President's object, and he attained\r\nit, in a great measure, by the treasury selection of deposit banks. In\r\nthis particular, therefore, to a great extent, his will prevailed. In\r\n1836, Congress refused to confine the receipts for public lands to gold\r\nand silver; but the President willed it, and his will prevailed. In\r\n1837, both houses of Congress, by more than two thirds, passed a bill\r\nfor restoring the former state of things by annulling the treasury\r\norder; but the President willed, notwithstanding, that the order should\r\nremain in force, and his will again prevailed. I repeat the question,\r\ntherefore, and I would put it earnestly to every intelligent man, to\r\nevery lover of our constitutional liberty, are we under the dominion of\r\nthe law? or has the effectual government of the country, at least in all\r\nthat regards the great interest of the currency, been in a single hand?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have done with the narrative of events and measures. I have\r\ndone with the history of these successive steps, in the progress of\r\nexecutive power, towards a complete control over the revenue and the\r\ncurrency. The result is now all before us. These pretended reforms,\r\nthese extraordinary exercises of power from an extraordinary zeal for\r\nthe good of the people, what have they brought us to?\r\n\r\nIn 1829, the currency was declared to be _neither sound nor uniform_; a\r\nproposition, in my judgment, altogether at variance with the fact,\r\nbecause I do not believe there ever was a country of equal extent, in\r\nwhich paper formed any part of the circulation, that possessed a\r\ncurrency so sound, so uniform, so convenient, and so perfect in all\r\nrespects, as the currency of this country, at the moment of the delivery\r\nof that message, in 1829.\r\n\r\nBut how is it now? Where has the improvement brought it? What has reform\r\ndone? What has the great cry for hard money accomplished? Is the\r\ncurrency _uniform_ now? Is money in New Orleans now as good, or nearly\r\nso, as money in New York? Are exchanges at par, or only at the same low\r\nrates as in 1829 and other years? Every one here knows that all the\r\nbenefits of this experiment are but injury and oppression; all this\r\nreform, but aggravated distress.\r\n\r\nAnd as to the _soundness_ of the currency, how does that stand? Are the\r\ncauses of alarm less now than in 1829? Is there less bank paper in\r\ncirculation? Is there less fear of a general catastrophe? Is property\r\nmore secure, or industry more certain of its reward? We all know,\r\nGentlemen, that, during all this pretended warfare against all banks,\r\nbanks have vastly increased. Millions upon millions of bank paper have\r\nbeen added to the circulation. Everywhere, and nowhere so much as where\r\nthe present administration and its measures have been most zealously\r\nsupported, banks have multiplied under State authority, since the decree\r\nwas made that the Bank of the United States should be suffered to\r\nexpire. Look at Mississippi, Missouri, Louisiana, Virginia, and other\r\nStates. Do we not see that banking capital and bank paper are enormously\r\nincreasing? The opposition to banks, therefore, so much professed,\r\nwhether it be real or whether it be but pretended, has not restrained\r\neither their number or their issues of paper. Both have vastly\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nAnd now a word or two, Gentlemen, upon this hard-money scheme, and the\r\nfancies and the delusions to which it has given birth. Gentlemen, this\r\nis a subject of delicacy, and one which it is difficult to treat with\r\nsufficient caution, in a popular and occasional address like this. I\r\nprofess to be a _bullionist_, in the usual and accepted sense of that\r\nword. I am for a solid specie basis for our circulation, and for specie\r\nas a part of the circulation, so far as it may be practicable and\r\nconvenient. I am for giving no value to paper, merely as paper. I abhor\r\npaper; that is to say, irredeemable paper, paper that may not be\r\nconverted into gold or silver at the will of the holder. But while I\r\nhold to all this, I believe, also, that an exclusive gold and silver\r\ncirculation is an utter impossibility in the present state of this\r\ncountry and of the world. We shall none of us ever see it; and it is\r\ncredulity and folly, in my opinion, to act under any such hope or\r\nexpectation. The States will make banks, and these will issue paper; and\r\nthe longer the government of the United States neglects its duty in\r\nregard to measures for regulating the currency, the greater will be the\r\namount of bank paper overspreading the country. Of this I entertain not\r\na particle of doubt.\r\n\r\nWhile I thus hold to the absolute and indispensable necessity of gold\r\nand silver, as the foundation of our circulation, I yet think nothing\r\nmore absurd and preposterous, than unnatural and strained efforts to\r\nimport specie. There is but so much specie in the world, and its amount\r\ncannot be greatly or suddenly increased. Indeed, there are reasons for\r\nsupposing that its amount has recently diminished, by the quantity used\r\nin manufactures, and by the diminished products of the mines. The\r\nexisting amount of specie, however, must support the paper circulations,\r\nand the systems of currency, not of the United States only, but of other\r\nnations also. One of its great uses is to pass from country to country,\r\nfor the purpose of settling occasional balances in commercial\r\ntransactions. It always finds its way, naturally and easily, to places\r\nwhere it is needed for these uses. But to take extraordinary pains to\r\nbring it where the course of trade does not bring it, where the state of\r\ndebt and credit does not require it to be, and then to endeavor, by\r\nunnecessary and injurious regulations, treasury orders, accumulations at\r\nthe mint, and other contrivances, there to retain it, is a course of\r\npolicy bordering, as it appears to me, on political insanity. It is\r\nboasted that we have seventy-five or eighty millions of specie now in\r\nthe country. But what more senseless, what more absurd, than this boast,\r\nif there is a balance against us abroad, of which payment is desired\r\nsooner than remittances of our own products are likely to make that\r\npayment? What more miserable than to boast of having that which is not\r\nours, which belongs to others, and which the convenience of others, and\r\nour own convenience also, require that they should possess? If Boston\r\nwere in debt to New York, would it be wise in Boston, instead of paying\r\nits debt, to contrive all possible means of obtaining specie from the\r\nNew York banks, and hoarding it at home? And yet this, as I think, would\r\nbe precisely as sensible as the course which the government of the\r\nUnited States at present pursues. We have, beyond all doubt, a great\r\namount of specie in the country, but it does not answer its accustomed\r\nend, it does not perform its proper duty. It neither goes abroad to\r\nsettle balances against us, and thereby quiet those who have demands\r\nupon us; nor is it so disposed of at home as to sustain the circulation\r\nto the extent which the circumstances of the times require. A great part\r\nof it is in the Western banks, in the land offices, on the roads\r\nthrough the wilderness, on the passages over the Lakes, from the land\r\noffices to the deposit banks, and from the deposit banks back to the\r\nland offices. Another portion is in the hands of buyers and sellers of\r\nspecie; of men in the West, who sell land-office money to the new\r\nsettlers for a high premium. Another portion, again, is kept in private\r\nhands, to be used when circumstances shall tempt to the purchase of\r\nlands. And, Gentlemen, I am inclined to think, so loud has been the cry\r\nabout hard money, and so sweeping the denunciation of all paper, that\r\nprivate holding, or hoarding, prevails to some extent in different parts\r\nof the country. These eighty millions of specie, therefore, really do us\r\nlittle good. We are weaker in our circulation, I have no doubt, our\r\ncredit is feebler, money is scarcer with us, at this moment, than if\r\ntwenty millions of this specie were shipped to Europe, and general\r\nconfidence thereby restored.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I will not say that some degree of pressure might not have\r\ncome upon us, if the treasury order had not issued. I will not say\r\nthat there has not been over-trading, and over-production, and a too\r\ngreat expansion of bank circulation. This may all be so, and the\r\nlast-mentioned evil, it was easy to foresee, was likely to happen when\r\nthe United States discontinued their own bank. But what I do say is,\r\nthat, acting upon the state of things as it actually existed, and is\r\nnow actually existing, the treasury order has been, and now is,\r\nproductive of great distress. It acts upon a state of things which gives\r\nextraordinary force to its stroke, and extraordinary point to its\r\nsting. It arrests specie, when the free use and circulation of specie\r\nare most important; it cripples the banks, at a moment when the banks\r\nmore than ever need all their means. It makes the merchant unable to\r\nremit, when remittance is necessary for his own credit, and for the\r\ngeneral adjustment of commercial balances. I am not now discussing\r\nthe general question, whether prices must not come down, and adjust\r\nthemselves anew to the amount of bullion existing in Europe and America.\r\nI am dealing only with the measures of our own government on the\r\nsubject of the currency, and I insist that these measures have been\r\nmost unfortunate, and most ruinous in their effects on the ordinary\r\nmeans of our circulation at home, and on our ability of remittance\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nTheir effects, too, on domestic exchanges, by deranging and misplacing\r\nthe specie which is in the country, are most disastrous. Let him who has\r\nlent an ear to all these promises of a more uniform currency see how he\r\ncan now sell his draft on New Orleans or Mobile. Let the Northern\r\nmanufacturers and mechanics, those who have sold the products of their\r\nlabor to the South, and heretofore realized the prices with little loss\r\nof exchange, let them try present facilities. Let them see what reform\r\nof the currency has done for them. Let them inquire whether, in this\r\nrespect, their condition is better or worse than it was five or six\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I hold this disturbance of the measure of value, and the\r\nmeans of payment and exchange, this derangement, and, if I may so say,\r\nthis violation of the currency, to be one of the most unpardonable of\r\npolitical faults. He who tampers with the currency robs labor of its\r\nbread. He panders, indeed, to greedy capital, which is keen-sighted,\r\nand may shift for itself; but he beggars labor, which is honest,\r\nunsuspecting, and too busy with the present to calculate for the\r\nfuture. The prosperity of the working classes lives, moves, and has\r\nits being in established credit, and a steady medium of payment. All\r\nsudden changes destroy it. Honest industry never comes in for any\r\npart of the spoils in that scramble which takes place when the\r\ncurrency of a country is disordered. Did wild schemes and projects\r\never benefit the industrious? Did irredeemable bank paper ever enrich\r\nthe laborious? Did violent fluctuations ever do good to him who\r\ndepends on his daily labor for his daily bread? Certainly never. All\r\nthese things may gratify greediness for sudden gain, or the rashness\r\nof daring speculation; but they can bring nothing but injury and\r\ndistress to the homes of patient industry and honest labor. Who are\r\nthey that profit by the present state of things? They are not the\r\nmany, but the few. They are speculators, brokers, dealers in money,\r\nand lenders of money at exorbitant interest. Small capitalists are\r\ncrushed, and, their means being dispersed, as usual, in various parts of\r\nthe country, and this miserable policy having destroyed exchanges, they\r\nhave no longer either money or credit. And all classes of labor\r\npartake, and must partake, in the same calamity. And what consolation\r\nfor all this is it, that the public lands are paid for in specie?\r\nthat, whatever embarrassment and distress pervade the country, the\r\nWestern wilderness is thickly sprinkled over with eagles and dollars?\r\nthat gold goes weekly from Milwaukie and Chicago to Detroit, and back\r\nagain from Detroit to Milwaukie and Chicago, and performs similar\r\nfeats of egress and regress in many other instances, in the Western\r\nStates? It is remarkable enough, that, with all this sacrifice of\r\ngeneral convenience, with all this sky-rending clamor for government\r\npayments in specie, government, after all, never gets a dollar. So far\r\nas I know, the United States have not now a single specie dollar in the\r\nworld. If they have, where is it? The gold and silver collected at the\r\nland-offices is sent to the deposit banks; it is there placed to the\r\ncredit of the government, and thereby becomes the property of the\r\nbank. The whole revenue of the government, therefore, after all,\r\nconsists in mere bank credits; that very sort of security which the\r\nfriends of the administration have so much denounced.\r\n\r\nRemember, Gentlemen, in the midst of this deafening din against all\r\nbanks, that, if it shall create such a panic as shall shut up the banks,\r\nit will shut up the treasury of the United States also.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I would not willingly be a prophet of ill. I most devoutly\r\nwish to see a better state of things; and I believe the repeal of the\r\ntreasury order would tend very much to bring about that better state of\r\nthings. And I am of opinion, that, sooner or later, the order will be\r\nrepealed. I think it must be repealed. I think the East, West, North,\r\nand South will demand its repeal. But, Gentlemen, I feel it my duty to\r\nsay, that, if I should be disappointed in this expectation, I see no\r\nimmediate relief to the distresses of the community. I greatly fear,\r\neven, that the worst is not yet.[107] I look for severer distresses; for\r\nextreme difficulties in exchange, for far greater inconveniences in\r\nremittance, and for a sudden fall in prices. Our condition is one which\r\nis not to be tampered with, and the repeal of the treasury order, being\r\nsomething which government can do, and which will do good, the public\r\nvoice is right in demanding that repeal. It is true, if repealed now,\r\nthe relief will come late. Nevertheless its repeal or abrogation is a\r\nthing to be insisted on, and pursued, till it shall be accomplished.\r\nThis executive control over the currency, this power of discriminating,\r\nby treasury order, between one man's debt and another man's debt, is a\r\nthing not to be endured in a free country; and it should be the\r\nconstant, persisting demand of all true Whigs, \"Rescind the illegal\r\ntreasury order, restore the rule of the law, place all branches of the\r\nrevenue on the same grounds, make men's rights equal, and leave the\r\ngovernment of the country where the Constitution leaves it, in the hands\r\nof the representatives of the people in Congress.\" This point should\r\nnever be surrendered or compromised. Whatever is established, let it be\r\nequal, and let it be legal. Let men know, to-day, what money may be\r\nrequired of them to-morrow. Let the role be open and public, on the\r\npages of the statute-book, not a secret, in the executive breast.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, in the session which has now just closed, I have done my\r\nutmost to effect a direct and immediate repeal of the treasury order.\r\n\r\nI have voted for a bill anticipating the payment of the French and\r\nNeapolitan indemnities by an advance from the treasury.\r\n\r\nI have voted with great satisfaction for the restoration of duties on\r\ngoods destroyed in the great conflagration in this city.\r\n\r\nI have voted for a deposit with the States of the surplus which may be\r\nin the treasury at the end of the year. All these measures have failed;\r\nand it is for you, and for our fellow-citizens throughout the country,\r\nto decide whether the public interest would, or would not, have been\r\npromoted by their success.\r\n\r\nBut I find, Gentlemen, that I am committing an unpardonable trespass on\r\nyour indulgent patience. I will pursue these remarks no further. And yet\r\nI cannot persuade myself to take leave of you without reminding you,\r\nwith the utmost deference and respect, of the important part assigned to\r\nyou in the political concerns of your country, and of the great\r\ninfluence of your opinions, your example, and your efforts upon the\r\ngeneral prosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\nWhigs of New York! Patriotic citizens of this great metropolis! Lovers\r\nof constitutional liberty, bound by interest and by affection to the\r\ninstitutions of your country, Americans in heart and in principle!--you\r\nare ready, I am sure, to fulfil all the duties imposed upon you by your\r\nsituation, and demanded of you by your country. You have a central\r\nposition; your city is the point from which intelligence emanates, and\r\nspreads in all directions over the whole land. Every hour carries\r\nreports of your sentiments and opinions to the verge of the Union. You\r\ncannot escape the responsibility which circumstances have thrown upon\r\nyou. You must live and act, on a broad and conspicuous theatre, either\r\nfor good or for evil to your country. You cannot shrink from your public\r\nduties; you cannot obscure yourselves, nor bury your talent. In the\r\ncommon welfare, in the common prosperity, in the common glory of\r\nAmericans, you have a stake of value not to be calculated. You have an\r\ninterest in the preservation of the Union, of the Constitution, and of\r\nthe true principles of the government, which no man can estimate. You\r\nact for yourselves, and for the generations that are to come after you;\r\nand those who ages hence shall bear your names, and partake your blood,\r\nwill feel, in their political and social condition, the consequences of\r\nthe manner in which you discharge your political duties.\r\n\r\nHaving fulfilled, then, on your part and on mine, though feebly and\r\nimperfectly on mine, the offices of kindness and mutual regard required\r\nby this occasion, shall we not use it to a higher and nobler purpose?\r\nShall we not, by this friendly meeting, refresh our patriotism, rekindle\r\nour love of constitutional liberty, and strengthen our resolutions of\r\npublic duty? Shall we not, in all honesty and sincerity, with pure and\r\ndisinterested love of country, as Americans, looking back to the renown\r\nof our ancestors, and looking forward to the interests of our posterity,\r\nhere, to-night, pledge our mutual faith to hold on to the last to our\r\nprofessed principles, to the doctrines of true liberty, and to the\r\nConstitution of the country, let who will prove true, or who will prove\r\nrecreant? Whigs of New York! I meet you in advance, and give you my\r\npledge for my own performance of these duties, without qualification and\r\nwithout reserve. Whether in public life or in private life, in the\r\nCapitol or at home, I mean never to desert them. I mean never to forget\r\nthat I have a country, to which I am bound by a thousand ties; and the\r\nstone which is to lie on the ground that shall cover me, shall not bear\r\nthe name of a son ungrateful to his native land.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n  [106] A Speech delivered at Niblo's Saloon, in New York, on the 15th of\r\n        March, 1837.\r\n\r\n  [107] On the 10th of June following the delivery of this speech, all the\r\n        banks in the city of New York, by common consent, suspended the\r\n        payment of their notes in specie. On the next day, the same step\r\n        was taken by the banks of Boston and the vicinity, and the\r\n        example was followed by all the banks south of New York, as they\r\n        received intelligence of the suspension of specie payments in\r\n        that city. On the 15th of June, (just three months from the day\r\n        this speech was delivered,) President Van Buren issued his\r\n        proclamation calling an extra session of Congress for the first\r\n        Monday of September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEPTION AT WHEELING.[108]\r\n\r\n  The following toast having been proposed,--\"Our distinguished\r\n  guest,--his manly and untiring, though unsuccessful, efforts to\r\n  sustain the supremacy of the Constitution and the laws against the\r\n  encroachments of executive power, and to avert the catastrophe that\r\n  now impends over the country, have given him a new claim to the\r\n  gratitude of his countrymen, and added a new lustre to that fame\r\n  which was already imperishably identified with the history of our\r\n  institutions,\"--Mr. Webster rose and responded, in substance, as\r\n  follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:--I cannot be indifferent to the\r\nmanifestations of regard with which I have been greeted by you, nor can\r\nI suffer any show of delicacy to prevent me from expressing my thanks\r\nfor your kindness.\r\n\r\nI travel, Gentlemen, for the purpose of seeing the country, and of\r\nseeing what constitutes the important part of every country, the people.\r\nI find everywhere much to excite, and much to gratify admiration; and\r\nthe pleasure I experience is only diminished by remembering the\r\nunparalleled state of distress which I have left behind me, and by the\r\napprehension, rather than the feeling, of severe evils, which I find to\r\nexist wherever I go.\r\n\r\nI cannot enable those who have not witnessed it to comprehend the full\r\nextent of the suffering in the Eastern cities. It was painful, indeed,\r\nto behold it. So many bankruptcies among great and small dealers, so\r\nmuch property sacrificed, so many industrious men altogether broken up\r\nin their business, so many families reduced from competence to want, so\r\nmany hopes crushed, so many happy prospects for ever clouded, and such\r\nfearful looking for still greater calamities,--all united form such a\r\nmass of evil as I had never expected to see, except as the result of\r\nwar, a pestilence, or some other external calamity.\r\n\r\nI have no wish, in the present state of things, nor should I have,\r\nindeed, if the state of things were different, to obtrude the expression\r\nof my political sentiments on such of my fellow-citizens as I may happen\r\nto meet; nor, on the other hand, have I any motive for concealing them,\r\nor suppressing their expression, whenever others desire that I should\r\nmake them known. Indeed, on the great topics that now engage public\r\nattention, I hope I may flatter myself that my opinions are already\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nRecent evils have not at all surprised me, except that they have come\r\nsooner and faster than I had anticipated. But, though not surprised, I\r\nam afflicted; I feel any thing but pleasure in this early fulfilment of\r\nmy own predictions. Much injury is done, which the wisest future\r\ncounsels can never repair, and much more that can never be remedied but\r\nby such counsels and by the lapse of time. From 1832 to the present\r\nmoment, I have foreseen this result. I may safely say I have foreseen\r\nit, because I have foretold and proclaimed its approach in every\r\nimportant discussion and debate in the public body of which I am a\r\nmember. In 1832, I happened to meet with a citizen of Wheeling, now\r\npresent, who has this day reminded me of what I then anticipated, as the\r\nresult of the measures which the administration appeared to be adopting\r\nin regard to the currency. In the summer of the next year, 1833, I was\r\nhere, and suggested to friends what I knew to be resolved upon by the\r\nexecutive, namely, the removal of the deposits of the public funds from\r\nthe Bank of the United States, which was announced two months\r\nafterwards. That was the avowed and declared commencement of the\r\n\"experiment.\" You know, Gentlemen, the obloquy then and since cast upon\r\nthose of us who opposed this \"experiment.\" You know that we have been\r\ncalled bank agents, bank advocates, bank hirelings. You know that it has\r\nbeen a thousand times said, that the experiment worked admirably, that\r\nnothing could do better, that it was the highest possible evidence of\r\nthe political wisdom and sagacity of its contrivers, and that none\r\nopposed it or doubted its efficiency but the wicked or the stupid. Well,\r\nGentlemen, here is the end, if this _is_ the end, of this notable\r\n\"experiment.\" Its singular wisdom has come to this; its fine workings\r\nhave wrought out an almost general bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nIts lofty promises, its grandeur, its flashes, that threw other men's\r\nsense and understanding back into the shade, where are they now? Here is\r\nthe \"fine of fines and the recovery of recoveries.\" Its panics, its\r\nscoffs, its jeers, its jests, its gibes at all former experience,--its\r\ncry of \"a new policy,\" which was so much to delight and astonish\r\nmankind,--to this conclusion has it come at last.\r\n\r\n  \"But yesterday, it might\r\n  Have stood against the world; now lies it there,\r\n  And none so poor to do it reverence!\"\r\n\r\nIt is with no feelings of boasting or triumph, it is with no\r\ndisposition to arrogate superior wisdom or discernment, but it is with\r\nmortification, with humiliation, with unaffected grief and affliction,\r\nthat I contemplate the condition of difficulty and distress to which\r\nthis country, so vigorous, so great, so enterprising, and so rich in\r\ninternal wealth, has been brought by the policy of her government.\r\n\r\nWe learn to-day that most of the Eastern banks have stopped payment, the\r\ndeposit banks as well as others. The experiment has exploded. That\r\nbubble, which so many of us have all along regarded as the offspring of\r\nconceit, presumption, and political quackery, has burst. A general\r\nsuspension of payment must be the result; a result which has come even\r\nsooner than was predicted. Where is now that better currency that was\r\npromised? Where is that specie circulation? Where are those rivers of\r\ngold and silver, which were to fill the treasury of the government as\r\nwell as the pockets of the people? Has the government a single hard\r\ndollar? Has the treasury any thing in the world but credit and deposits\r\nin banks that have already suspended payment? How are public creditors\r\nnow to be paid in specie? How are the deposits, which the law requires\r\nto be made with the States on the 1st of July, now to be made? We must\r\ngo back to the beginning, and take a new start. Every step in our\r\nfinancial banking system, since 1832, has been a false step; it has been\r\na step which has conducted us farther and farther from the path of\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nThe discontinuance of the national bank, the illegal removal of the\r\ndeposits, the accumulation of the public revenue in banks selected by\r\nthe executive, and for a long time subject to no legal regulation or\r\nrestraint, and finally the unauthorized and illegal treasury order, have\r\nbrought us where we are. The destruction of the national bank was the\r\nsignal for the creation of an unprecedented number of new State banks,\r\noften with nominal capitals, out of all proportion to the business of\r\nthe quarters where they were established. These banks, lying under no\r\nrestraint from the general government or any of its institutions, issued\r\npaper money corresponding to their own sense of their immediate\r\ninterests and hopes of gain. The deposit with the State banks of the\r\nwhole public revenue, then accumulated to a vast amount, and making this\r\ndeposit without any legal restraint or control whatever, increased both\r\nthe power and disposition of these banks for extensive issues. In this\r\nway the government seems to have administered every possible provocation\r\nto the banks to induce them to extend their circulation. It uniformly,\r\nzealously, and successfully opposed the land bill, a most useful\r\nmeasure, by which accumulation in the treasury would have been\r\nprevented; and, as if it desired and sought this accumulation, it\r\nfinally resisted, with all its power, the deposit among the States. It\r\nis urged as a reason for the present overthrow, that an extraordinary\r\nspirit of speculation has gone abroad, and has been manifested\r\nparticularly and strongly in the endeavor to purchase the public lands;\r\nbut has not every act of the government directly encouraged this spirit?\r\nIt accumulated revenue which it did not need, all of which is left in\r\nthe deposit banks. The banks had money to lend, and there were enough\r\nwho were ready to borrow, for the purpose of purchasing the public lands\r\nat government prices. The public treasury was thus made the great and\r\nefficient means of effecting those purchases which have since been so\r\nmuch denounced as extravagant speculation and extensive monopoly. These\r\npurchasers borrowed the public money; they used the public money to buy\r\nthe public property; they speculated on the strength of the public\r\nmoney; and while all this was going on, and every man saw it, the\r\nadministration resisted, to the utmost of its power, every attempt to\r\nwithdraw this money from the banks and from the hands of those\r\nspeculators, and distribute it among the people to whom it belonged.\r\n\r\nIf, then, there has been over-trading, the government has encouraged\r\nit; if there have been rash speculations in the public lands, the\r\ngovernment has furnished the means out of the treasury. These\r\nunprecedented sales of the public domain were boasted of as proofs of a\r\nhappy state of things, and of a wise administration of the government,\r\ndown to the moment when Congress, in opposition to executive wishes,\r\npassed the distribution law, thus withdrawing the surplus revenue from\r\nthe deposit banks. The success of that measure compelled a change in the\r\nexecutive policy, as the accumulation of a vast amount of money in the\r\ntreasury was no longer desirable. This is the most favorable motive to\r\nwhich I can ascribe the treasury order of July. It is now said that that\r\norder was issued for the purpose of enforcing a strict execution of the\r\nlaw which forbids the allowance of credits upon purchases of the public\r\nlands; but there was no such credit allowed before; not an hour was\r\ngiven beyond the time of sale. In this respect, the order produces no\r\ndifference whatever. Its only effect is to require an immediate payment\r\nin specie, whereas, before, an immediate payment in the bills of\r\nspecie-paying banks was demanded. There is no more credit in the one\r\ncase than in the other; and the government gets just as much specie in\r\none case as in the other; for no sooner is the specie, which the\r\npurchaser is compelled to procure, often at great charge, paid to the\r\nreceiver, than it is sent to the deposit banks, and the government has\r\ncredit for it on the books of the bank; but the specie itself is again\r\nsold by the bank, or disposed of as it sees fit. It is evident that the\r\ngovernment gets nothing by all this, though the purchasers of small\r\ntracts are put to great trouble and expense. No one gains any thing but\r\nthe banks and the brokers. It is, moreover, most true that the art of\r\nman could not have devised a plan more effectually to give to the large\r\npurchasers or speculators a decided preference and advantage over small\r\npurchasers, who bought for actual settlement, than the treasury order of\r\nJuly, 1836. The stoppage of the banks, however, has now placed the\r\nactual settler in a still more unfortunate situation. How is he to\r\nobtain money to pay for his quarter-section? He must travel three or\r\nfour times as many miles for it as he has dollars to pay, even if he\r\nshould be able to obtain it at the end of that journey.\r\n\r\nI will not say that other causes, at home and abroad, have not had an\r\nagency in bringing about the present derangement. I know that\r\ncredits have been used beyond all former example. It is probable the\r\nspirit of trade has been too highly excited, and that the pursuit of\r\nbusiness may have been pressed too fast and too far. All this I am\r\nready to admit. But instead of doing any thing to abate this tendency,\r\nthe government has been the prime instrument of fostering and\r\nencouraging it. It has parted voluntarily, and by advice, with all\r\ncontrol over the actual currency of the country. It has given a free\r\nand full scope to the spirit of banking; it has aided the spirit of\r\nspeculation with the public treasures; and it has done all this, in the\r\nmidst of loud-sounding promises of an exclusive specie medium, and a\r\nprofessed detestation of all banking institutions.\r\n\r\nIt is vain, therefore, to say that the present state of affairs is\r\nowing, not to the acts of government, but to other causes, over which\r\ngovernment could exercise no control. Much of it _is_ owing to the\r\ncourse of the national government; and what is not so, is owing to\r\ncauses the operation of which government was bound in duty to use all\r\nits legal powers to control.\r\n\r\nIs there an intelligent man in the community, at this moment, who\r\nbelieves that, if the Bank of the United States had been continued, if\r\nthe deposits had not been removed, if the specie circular had not been\r\nissued, the financial affairs of the country would have been in as bad a\r\nstate as they now are? When certain consequences are repeatedly depicted\r\nand foretold from particular causes, when the manner in which these\r\nconsequences will be produced is precisely pointed out beforehand, and\r\nwhen the consequences come in the manner foretold, who will stand up and\r\ndeclare, that, notwithstanding all this, there is no connection between\r\nthe cause and the consequence, and that all these effects are\r\nattributable to some other causes, nobody knows what?\r\n\r\nNo doubt but we shall hear every cause but the true one assigned for the\r\npresent distress. It will be laid to the opposition in and out of\r\nCongress; it will be laid to the bank; it will be laid to the merchants;\r\nit will be laid to the manufacturers; it will be laid to the tariff; it\r\nwill be laid to the north star, or to the malign influence of the last\r\ncomet, whose tail swept near or across the orbit of our earth, before we\r\nshall be allowed to ascribe it to its just, main causes, a tampering\r\nwith the currency, and an attempt to stretch executive power over a\r\nsubject not constitutionally within its reach.\r\n\r\nWe have heard, Gentlemen, of the suspension of some of the Eastern banks\r\nonly; but I fear the same course must be adopted by all the banks\r\nthroughout the country. The United States Bank, now a mere State\r\ninstitution, with no public deposits, no aid from government, but, on\r\nthe contrary, long an object of bitter persecution by it, was, at our\r\nlast advices, still firm. But can we expect of that bank to make\r\nsacrifices to continue specie payment? If it continue to do so now that\r\nthe deposit banks have stopped, the government, if possible, will draw\r\nfrom it its last dollar, in order to keep up a pretence of making its\r\nown payments in specie. I shall be glad if this institution find it\r\nprudent and proper to hold out;[109] but as it owes no more duty to the\r\ngovernment than any other bank, and, of course, much less than the\r\ndeposit banks, I cannot see any ground for demanding from it efforts and\r\nsacrifices to favor the government, which those holding the public\r\nmoney, and owing duty to the government, are unwilling or unable to\r\nmake. Nor do I see how the New England banks can stand alone in the\r\ngeneral crash. I believe those in Massachusetts are very sound and\r\nentirely solvent; I have every confidence in their ability to pay and I\r\nshall rejoice if, amidst the present wreck, we find them able to\r\nwithstand the storm. At the same time, I confess I shall not be\r\ndisappointed, if they, seeing no public object to be attained\r\nproportioned to the private loss, and individual sacrifice and ruin,\r\nwhich must result from resorting to the means necessary to enable them\r\nto hold out, should not be distinguished from their Southern and Western\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nI believe, Gentlemen, the \"experiment\" must go through. I believe every\r\npart and portion of our country will have a satisfactory taste of the\r\n\"better currency.\" I believe we shall be blest again with the currency\r\nof 1812, _when money was the only uncurrent species of property_. We\r\nhave, amidst all the distress that surrounds us, men in and out of\r\npower, who condemn a national bank in every form, maintain the efficacy\r\nand efficiency of State banks for domestic exchange, and, amidst all the\r\nsufferings and terrors of the \"experiment,\" cry out, that they are\r\nestablishing \"a better currency.\" The \"experiment,\"--the experiment upon\r\nwhat? The experiment of one man upon the happiness, the well-being,\r\nand, I may almost say, upon the lives, of twelve millions of human\r\nbeings,--an \"experiment\" that found us in health, that found us with the\r\nbest currency on the face of the earth, the same from the North to the\r\nSouth, from Boston to St. Louis, equalling silver or gold in any part of\r\nour Union, and possessing the unlimited confidence of foreign countries,\r\nand which leaves us crushed, ruined, without means at home, and without\r\ncredit abroad.\r\n\r\nThis word \"experiment\" appears likely to get into no enviable notoriety.\r\nIt may probably be held, in future, to signify any thing which is too\r\nexcruciating to be borne, like a pang of the rheumatism or an\r\nextraordinary twinge of the gout. Indeed, from the experience we now\r\nhave, we may judge that the bad eminence of the Inquisition itself may\r\nbe superseded by it, and if one shall be hereafter stretched upon the\r\nrack, or broken on the wheel, it may be said, while all his bones are\r\ncracking, all his muscles snapping, all his veins are pouring, that he\r\nis only passing into a better state through the delightful process of an\r\n\"experiment.\"\r\n\r\nGentlemen, you will naturally ask, Where is this to end, and what is\r\nto be the remedy? These are questions of momentous importance; but\r\nprobably the proper moment has not come for considering this. We are yet\r\nin the midst of the whirlwind. Every man's thoughts are turned to his\r\nown immediate preservation. When the blast is over, and we have\r\nbreathing-time the country must take this subject, this all-important\r\nsubject of relief for the present and security for the future, into\r\nits most serious consideration. It will, undoubtedly, first engage\r\nthe attention and wisdom of Congress. It will call on public men,\r\nintrusted with public affairs, to lay aside party and private\r\npreferences and prejudices, and unite in the great work of redeeming\r\nthe country from this state of disaster and disgrace. All that I mean\r\nat present to say is, that the government of the United States stands\r\nchargeable, in my opinion, with a gross dereliction from duty, in\r\nleaving the currency of the country entirely at the mercy of others,\r\nwithout seeking to exercise over it any control whatever. The _means_ of\r\nexercising this control rest in the wisdom of Congress, but the duty I\r\nhold to be imperative. It is a power that cannot be yielded to others\r\nwith safety to itself or to them. It might as well give up to the\r\nStates the power of making peace or war, and leave the twenty-six\r\nindependent sovereignties to select their own foes, raise their own\r\ntroops, and conclude their own terms of peace. It might as well leave\r\nthe States to impose their own duties and regulate their own terms and\r\ntreaties of commerce, as to give up control over the currency in which\r\nall are interested.\r\n\r\nThe present government has been in operation forty-eight years. During\r\nforty of these forty-eight years we have had a national institution\r\nperforming the duties of a fiscal agent to the government, and\r\nexercising a most useful control over the domestic exchanges and over\r\nthe currency of the country. The first institution was chartered on the\r\nground that such an institution was _necessary_ to the safe and\r\neconomical administration of the treasury department in the collection\r\nand disbursement of its revenue. The experience of the new government\r\nhad clearly proved this necessity. At that time, however, there were\r\nthose who doubted the power of Congress, under the provisions of the\r\nConstitution, to incorporate a bank; but a majority of both houses were\r\nof a different opinion. President Washington sanctioned the measure, and\r\namong those who entertained doubts on the subject, the statesmen of most\r\nweight and consideration in the Union, and whose opinions were entitled\r\nto the highest respect, yielded to the opinion of Congress and the\r\ncountry, and considered it a settled question. Among those who first\r\ndoubted of the power of the government to establish a national bank, was\r\none whose name should never be mentioned without respect, one for whom I\r\ncan say I feel as high a veneration as one man can or ought to feel for\r\nanother, one who was intimately associated with all the provisions of\r\nthe Constitution,--Mr. Madison. Yet, when Congress had decided on the\r\nmeasure, by large majorities, when the President had approved it, when\r\nthe judicial tribunals had sanctioned it, when public opinion had\r\ndeliberately and decidedly confirmed it, _he_ looked on the subject as\r\ndefinitely and finally settled. The reasoners of our day think\r\notherwise. No decision, no public sanction, no judgment of the\r\ntribunals, is allowed to weigh against their respect for their own\r\nopinions. They rush to the argument as to that of a new question,\r\ndespising all lights but that of their own unclouded sagacity, and\r\ncareless alike of the venerable living and of the mighty dead. They\r\npoise this important question upon some small points of their own\r\nslender logic, and decide it on the strength of their own unintelligible\r\nmetaphysics. It never enters into all their thoughts that this is a\r\nquestion to be judged of on broad, comprehensive, and practical grounds;\r\nstill less does it occur to them that an exposition of the Constitution,\r\ncontemporaneous with its earliest existence, acted on for nearly half a\r\ncentury, in which the original framers and government officers of the\r\nhighest note concurred, ought to have any weight in their decision, or\r\ninspire them with the least doubt of the accuracy and soundness of their\r\nown opinions. They soar so high in the regions of self-respect as to be\r\nfar beyond the reach of all such considerations.\r\n\r\nFor sound views upon the subject of a national bank, I would commend\r\nyou, Gentlemen, to the messages of Mr. Madison, and to his letter on the\r\nsubject. They are the views of a truly great man and a statesman.\r\n\r\nAs the first Bank of the United States had its origin in necessity, so\r\nhad the second; and, although there was something of misfortune, and\r\ncertainly something of mismanagement, in its early career, no candid and\r\nintelligent man can, for a moment, doubt or deny its usefulness, or that\r\nit fully accomplished the object for which it was created. Exchanges,\r\nduring all the later years of its existence, were easily effected, and a\r\ncurrency the most uniform of any in the world existed throughout the\r\ncountry. The opponents of these institutions did not deny that general\r\nprosperity and a happy state of things existed at the time they were in\r\noperation, but contended that equal prosperity would exist without them,\r\nwhile specie would take the place of their issues as a circulating\r\nmedium. How have their words been verified? Both in the case of the\r\nfirst bank and that of the last, a general suspension of specie payments\r\nhas happened in about a year from the time they were suffered to expire,\r\nand a universal confusion and distrust prevailed. The charter of the\r\nfirst bank expired in 1811, and all the State banks, south of New\r\nEngland, stopped payment in 1812. The charter of the late bank expired\r\nin March, 1836, and in May, 1837, a like distrust, and a like suspension\r\nof the State banks, have taken place.\r\n\r\nThe same results, we may readily suppose, are attributable to the same\r\ncauses, and we must look to the experience and wisdom of the people and\r\nof Congress to apply the requisite remedy. I will not say the only\r\nremedy is a national bank; but I will say that, in my opinion the only\r\nsure remedy for the evils that now prey upon us is the assumption, by\r\nthe delegates of the people in the national government, of some lawful\r\ncontrol over the finances of the nation, and a power of regulating its\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGentlemen, allow me again to express my thanks for the kindness you have\r\nshown me this day, and in conclusion to assure you, that, though a\r\nrepresentative in the federal government of but a small section, when\r\ncompared with the vast territory that acknowledges allegiance to that\r\ngovernment, I shall never forget that I am acting for the whole country,\r\nand, so far as I am capable, will pledge myself impartially to use every\r\nexertion for that country's welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n  [108] A Speech delivered on the 17th of May, 1837, at a Public Dinner\r\n        given to Mr. Webster by the Citizens of Wheeling, Virginia.\r\n\r\n  [109] The mail of that day brought advice of its suspension. See the\r\n        note on page 378.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEPTION AT MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE.\r\n\r\n  The following account of Mr. Webster's visit to Madison, Indiana, is\r\n  taken from the \"Republican Banner,\" of the 7th of June, 1837.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DANIEL WEBSTER visited our town on Thursday last. Notice had been given\r\nthe day previous of the probable time of his arrival. At the hour\r\ndesignated, crowds of citizens from the town and country thronged the\r\nquay. A gun from the Ben Franklin, as she swept gracefully round the\r\npoint, gave notice of his approach, and was answered by a gun from the\r\nshore. Gun followed gun in quick succession, from boat and shore, and\r\nthe last of the old national salute was echoing from hill and glen as\r\nthe Franklin reached the wharf. Mr. Webster was immediately waited on by\r\nthe committee appointed to receive him, and, attended by them, a\r\ncommittee of invitation from Cincinnati, and several gentlemen from\r\nLouisville, he landed amidst the cheers and acclamations of the\r\nassembled multitude. He was seated in an elegant barouche, supported by\r\nGovernor Hendricks and John King, Esq., and, with the different\r\ncommittees, and a large procession of citizens in barouches, on\r\nhorseback, and on foot, formed under the direction of Messrs. Wharton\r\nand Payne of the committee of arrangements, marshals of the day,\r\nproceeded to the place appointed for his reception, an arbor erected at\r\nthe north end of the market-house, fronting the large area formed by the\r\nintersection of Main and Main Cross Streets and the public square, and\r\ntastefully decorated with shrubbery, evergreens, and wreaths of flowers.\r\nIn the background appeared portraits of Washington and Lafayette, the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and several other appropriate badges and\r\nemblems, while in front a flag floated proudly on the breeze, bearing\r\nfor its motto the ever-memorable sentiment with which he concluded his\r\nimmortal speech in defence of the Constitution, 'LIBERTY AND UNION, NOW\r\nAND FOR EVER, ONE AND INSEPARABLE.' When the procession arrived, Mr.\r\nWebster ascended the stand in the arbor, supported by Governor Hendricks\r\nand the committee of arrangements, when he was appropriately and\r\neloquently addressed by J. G. Marshall, Esq., on behalf of the citizens,\r\nto which he responded in a speech of an hour's length.\"\r\n\r\n  The following correspondence preceded Mr. Webster's visit.\r\n\r\n\"_Louisville, May 30, 1837._\r\n\r\n\"HON. DANIEL WEBSTER:--\r\n\r\n\"Sir,--Your fellow-citizens of the town of Madison, Indiana, deeply\r\nimpressed with a sense of the obligations which they and all the true\r\nlovers of constitutional liberty, and friends to our happy and glorious\r\nUnion, owe you for the many prominent services rendered by you to their\r\nbeloved, though now much agitated and injured country, having appointed\r\nthe undersigned a committee through whom to tender you their salutations\r\nand the hospitalities of their town, desire us earnestly to request you\r\nto partake of a public dinner, or such other expression of the high\r\nestimation in which they hold you as may be most acceptable, at such\r\ntime as you may designate.\r\n\r\n\"Entertaining the hope that you may find it convenient to comply with\r\nthis request of our constituents and ourselves, we beg leave, with\r\nsentiments of the most profound respect and regard, to subscribe\r\nourselves,\r\n\r\n  \"Your fellow-citizens,\r\n\r\n  W.

I shall leave\r\nthis place on Thursday morning, and will stop at Madison, and shall be\r\nmost happy to see any of its citizens who may desire to meet me. I must\r\npray to be excused from a formal public dinner, as well from a regard to\r\nthe time which it will be in my power to pass with you, as from a\r\ngeneral wish, whenever it is practicable, to avoid every thing like\r\nceremony or show in my intercourse with my fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n\"You truly observe, Gentlemen, that the country at the present moment is\r\nagitated. I think, too, that you are right in saying it is injured; that\r\nis, I think public measures of a very injurious character and tendency\r\nhave been unfortunately adopted. But our case is not one that leads us\r\nto much despondency. The country, the happy and glorious country in\r\nwhich you and I live, is great, free, and full of resources; and, in the\r\nmain, an intelligent and patriotic spirit pervades the community. These\r\nwill bring all things right. Whatsoever has been injudiciously or rashly\r\ndone may be corrected by wiser counsels. Nothing can, for any great\r\nlength of time, depress the great interests of the people of the United\r\nStates, if wisdom and honest good-sense shall prevail in their public\r\nmeasures. Our present point of suffering is the _currency_. In my\r\nopinion, this is an interest with the preservation of which Congress is\r\ncharged, solemnly and deeply charged. A uniform currency was one of the\r\ngreat objects of the Union. If we fail to maintain it, we so far fail of\r\nwhat was intended by the national Constitution. Let us strive to avert\r\nthis reproach from that government and that Union, which make us, in so\r\nmany respects, ONE PEOPLE! Be assured, that to the attainment of this\r\nend every power and faculty of my mind shall be directed; and may\r\nProvidence so prosper us, that no one shall be able to say, that in any\r\nthing this glorious union of the States has come short of fulfilling\r\neither its own duties or the just expectations of the people.\r\n\r\n\"With sentiments of true regard, Gentlemen, I am your much obliged\r\nfriend and fellow-citizen,\r\n\r\n\"DANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n  \"To W. LYLE,\r\n  W. J. MCCLURE,\r\n  WM. F. COLLUM,\r\n  A. W. PITCHER,\r\n  JAMES E. LEWIS,\r\n  D. L. MCCLURE,\r\n              } _Committee_.\"\r\n\r\n  The address of Mr. Marshall, above alluded to, was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"SIR,--The people now assembled around you, through me, the humble organ\r\nof their selection, do most sincerely and cordially welcome you to\r\nMadison. In extending to you the most liberal hospitality, they do no\r\nmore, however, than they would be inclined to do towards the humblest\r\ncitizen of our common country. But this public and formal manifestation\r\nof the feeling of regard which they entertain for you is intended to do\r\nmore than inform you of the simple fact that here you can find food and\r\nshelter, and partake with them of the pleasures of the social circle. If\r\nthis were all, it might be communicated in a manner more acceptable, by\r\nextending to you the hand of friendship and kindly pointing you to the\r\nfamily board; but by this public parade, this assembling of the people\r\naround you, it is intended to give you that consolation, (most grateful\r\nand cheering to every true American heart,) _the people's_ approbation\r\nof your acts as a public servant. This is done, not with that abject\r\nfeeling which characterizes the homage of subjects, but with that nobler\r\nfeeling which prompts freemen to honor and esteem those who have been\r\ntheir country's benefactors. Prompted by such feeling, the patriots of\r\nthe Revolution delighted to honor the _father of our country_. He led\r\nhis armies to victory, and thus wrested the liberties of his countrymen\r\nfrom the grasp of a tyrant; and may we not from like impulses manifest\r\ngratitude towards those who, by the power of their intellects, have\r\neffectually rebuked erroneous principles, which were evidently\r\nundermining and endangering the very existence of our beloved Union?\r\nYes, Sir, our country has now nothing to fear from external violence. It\r\nis a danger which the whole country can see on its first approach, and\r\nevery arm will be nerved at once to repel it; it can be met at the point\r\nof the bayonet, and millions would now, as in days that are past, be\r\nready to shed their blood in defence of their country. But, Sir, in\r\n_those_ who artfully excite the passions and prejudices of the people,\r\nand, by presenting to them the most plausible pretexts (for their own\r\nselfish purposes), lead them thoughtlessly to abandon the sacred\r\nprinciples upon which our government is founded, and to reject the\r\nmeasures which can alone promote the prosperity of the country,--in such\r\nwe meet an enemy against whom the most daring bravery of the soldier is\r\ntotally unavailing.\r\n\r\n\"The injury which is inflicted is not at first felt; time is required to\r\ndevelop it; and when developed, the closest investigation may be\r\nnecessary to trace it to its cause; this the people may not be able to\r\naccomplish. This enemy to the country can only be discerned by the keen\r\neye of the statesman, and met and conquered by the power of his\r\nintellect. And he who is successful in thus defending his country may\r\nwell be held in grateful remembrance by his fellow-citizens. It is for\r\nsuch reasons, Sir, that we have presented to you these testimonials of\r\nour approbation. Though personally a stranger to us, your public\r\ncharacter, your masterly efforts in defence of the Constitution, the\r\nservices you have rendered the West, and the principles and measures\r\nwhich you have so ably advocated, are known and approved, and I hope\r\nwill ever be remembered by us. And although some of your efforts have\r\nproved for the time unsuccessful, it is to be hoped they would now have\r\na different effect. When the old and established measures of any\r\ngovernment have been abandoned for new ones, simply as an _experiment_,\r\nand when that experiment, if it does not produce, is, to say the least,\r\nimmediately followed by, ruin and distress in every part of the country,\r\nmay we not hope that men will at least calmly and dispassionately hear\r\nand weigh the reasons why a different policy should be adopted? But if\r\nthe people's representatives cannot be convinced of the error into which\r\nthey have been led, it is high time the people themselves should awake\r\nfrom their slumbers. A dark cloud hangs over the land, so thick, so\r\ndark, a ray of hope can hardly penetrate it. But shall the people gird\r\non their armor and march to battle? No, Sir; it is a battle which they\r\nmust fight through the ballot-box; and perhaps they do not know against\r\nwhat to direct their effort; they are almost in a state of despondency,\r\nready to conclude that they are driven to the verge of ruin by a kind of\r\nirresistible destiny. The cause of the evil can be discovered only by\r\ninvestigation; and to their public men they must look for information\r\nand for wisdom to direct them. But, Sir, it is not our object to relate\r\nto you our grievances, or recount the past services which you have\r\nrendered your country. We wish to cheer you on to increased efforts in\r\nurging the measures you have heretofore so zealously and ably advocated.\r\nMay your success be equal to your efforts, and may happiness and\r\nprosperity attend you through life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEPTION AT MADISON.[110]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, fellow-citizens, I can make myself heard by this numerous assembly,\r\nspeaking, as I do, in the open air, I will return to you my heartfelt\r\nthanks for the kindness you have shown me. I come among you a stranger.\r\nOn the day before yesterday I placed my foot, for the first time, on the\r\nsoil of the great and growing State of Indiana. Although I have lived on\r\nterms of great intimacy and friendship with several Western gentlemen,\r\nmembers of Congress, among whom is your estimable townsman near me,\r\n(Governor Hendricks,) I have never before had an opportunity of seeing\r\nand forming an acquaintance for myself with my fellow-citizens of this\r\nsection of the Union. I travel for this purpose. I confess that I regard\r\nwith astonishment the evidences of intelligence, enterprise, and\r\nrefinement everywhere exhibited around me, when I think of the short\r\ntime that has elapsed since the spot where I stand was a howling\r\nwilderness. Since I entered public life, this State was unknown as a\r\npolitical government. All the country west of the Alleghanies and\r\nnorthwest of the Ohio constituted but one Territory, entitled to a\r\nsingle delegate in the counsels of the nation, having the right to\r\nspeak, but not to vote. Since then, the States of Ohio, Indiana,\r\nIllinois, Michigan, and the long strip of country known as the Territory\r\nof Wisconsin, have been carved out of it. Indiana, which numbers but\r\ntwenty years since the commencement of her political existence, contains\r\na population of six hundred thousand, equal to the population of\r\nMassachusetts, a State of two hundred years' duration. In age she is an\r\ninfant; in strength and resources a giant. Her appearance indicates the\r\nfull vigor of maturity, while, measured by her years, she is yet in the\r\ncradle.\r\n\r\nAlthough I reside in a part of the country most remote from you,\r\nalthough I have seen you spring into existence and advance with rapid\r\nstrides in the march of prosperity and power, until your population has\r\nequalled that of my own State, which you far surpass in fertility of\r\nsoil and mildness of climate; yet these things have excited in me no\r\nfeelings of dislike, or jealousy, or envy. On the contrary, I have\r\nwitnessed them with pride and pleasure, when I saw in them the growth of\r\na member of our common country; and with feelings warmer than pride,\r\nwhen I recollect that there are those among you who are bone of my bone\r\nand flesh of my flesh, who inherit my name and share my blood. When they\r\ncame to me for my advice, before leaving their hearths and homes, I did\r\nnot oppose their desires or suggest difficulties in their paths. I told\r\nthem, \"Go and join your destinies with those of the hardy pioneers of\r\nthe West, share their hardships, and partake their fortunes; go, and God\r\nspeed you; only carry with you your own good principles, and whether the\r\nsun rises on you, or sets on you, let it warm American hearts in your\r\nbosoms.\"\r\n\r\nThough, as I observed, I live in a part of the country most remote from\r\nyou, fellow-citizens, I have been no inattentive observer of your\r\nhistory and progress. I have heard of the reports made in your\r\nlegislature, and the acts passed in pursuance thereof. I have traced on\r\nthe map of your State the routes marked out for extensive turnpikes,\r\nrailroads, and canals. I have read with pleasure the acts providing for\r\ntheir establishment and completion. I do not pretend to offer you my\r\nadvice; it would perhaps be presumptuous; but you will permit me to say,\r\nthat, as far as I have examined them, they are conceived in wisdom, and\r\nevince great political skill and foresight. You have commenced at the\r\nright point. To open the means of communication, by which man may, when\r\nhe wishes, see the face of his friend, should be the first work of every\r\ngovernment. We may theorize and speculate about it as we please,--we may\r\nunderstand all the metaphysics of politics; but if men are confined to\r\nthe narrow spot they inhabit, because they have not the means of\r\ntravelling when they please, they must go back to a state of barbarism.\r\nSocial intercourse is the corner-stone of good government. The nation\r\nthat provides no means for the improvement of its communications, has\r\nnot taken the first step in civilization. Go on, then, as you have\r\nbegun; prosecute your works with energy and perseverance; be not daunted\r\nby imaginary difficulties, be not deterred by exaggerated calculations\r\nof their cost. Go on; open your wilderness to the sun; turn up the soil;\r\nand in the wide-spread and highly-cultivated fields, the smiling\r\nvillages, and the busy towns that will spring up from the bosom of the\r\ndesert, you will reap a rich reward for your investment and industry.\r\n\r\nAnother of the paramount objects of government, to which I rejoice to\r\nsee that you have turned your attention, is education. I speak not of\r\ncollege education, nor of academy education, though they are of great\r\nimportance; I speak of free-school education, common-school education.\r\n\r\nAmong the luminaries in the sky of New England, the burning lights which\r\nthrow intelligence and happiness on her people, the first and most\r\nbrilliant is her system of common schools. I congratulate myself that my\r\nfirst speech on entering public life was in their behalf. Education, to\r\naccomplish the ends of good government, should be universally diffused.\r\nOpen the doors of the school-house to all the children in the land. Let\r\nno man have the excuse of poverty for not educating his own offspring.\r\nPlace the means of education within his reach, and if they remain in\r\nignorance, be it his own reproach. If one object of the expenditure of\r\nyour revenue be protection against crime, you could not devise a better\r\nor cheaper means of obtaining it. Other nations spend their money in\r\nproviding means for its detection and punishment, but it is the\r\nprinciple of our government to provide for its never occurring. The one\r\nacts by _coercion_, the other by _prevention_. On the diffusion of\r\neducation among the people rest the preservation and perpetuation of our\r\nfree institutions. I apprehend no danger to our country from a foreign\r\nfoe. The prospect of a war with any powerful nation is too remote to be\r\na matter of calculation. Besides, there is no nation on earth powerful\r\nenough to accomplish our overthrow. Our destruction, should it come at\r\nall, will be from another quarter. From the inattention of the people to\r\nthe concerns of their government, from their carelessness and\r\nnegligence, I must confess that I do apprehend some danger. I fear that\r\nthey may place too implicit a confidence in their public servants, and\r\nfail properly to scrutinize their conduct; that in this way they may be\r\nmade the dupes of designing men, and become the instruments of their own\r\nundoing. Make them intelligent, and they will be vigilant; give them the\r\nmeans of detecting the wrong, and they will apply the remedy.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman who has just addressed me in such flattering, but\r\nunmerited terms, has been pleased to make kind mention of my devotion to\r\nthe Constitution, and my humble efforts in its support. I claim no merit\r\non that account. It results from my sense of its surpassing excellences,\r\nwhich must strike every man who attentively and impartially examines it.\r\nI regard it as the work of the purest patriots and wisest statesmen that\r\never existed, aided by the smiles of a benignant Providence; for when we\r\nregard it as a system of government growing out of the discordant\r\nopinions and conflicting interests of thirteen independent States, it\r\nalmost appears a Divine interposition in our behalf. I have always, with\r\nthe utmost zeal and the moderate abilities I possess, striven to prevent\r\nits infraction in the slightest particular. I believed, if that bond of\r\nunion were broken, we should never again be a united people. Where,\r\namong all the political thinkers, the constitution-makers and the\r\nconstitution-menders of the day, could we find a man to make us another?\r\nWho would even venture to propose a reunion? Where would be the\r\nstarting-point, and what the plan? I do not expect miracles to follow\r\neach other. No plan could be proposed that would be adopted; the hand\r\nthat destroys the Constitution rends our Union asunder for ever.\r\n\r\nMy friend has been pleased to remember, in his address, my humble\r\nsupport of the constitutional right of Congress to improve the\r\nnavigation of our great internal rivers, and to construct roads through\r\nthe different States. It is well known that few persons entertain\r\nstronger opinions on this subject than myself. Believing that the great\r\nobject of the Union is to secure the general safety and promote the\r\ngeneral welfare, and that the Constitution was designed to point out the\r\nmeans of accomplishing these ends, I have always been in favor of such\r\nmeasures as I deemed for the general benefit, under the restrictions and\r\nlimitations prescribed by the Constitution itself. I supported them with\r\nmy voice, and my vote, not because they were for the benefit of the\r\nWest, but because they were for the benefit of the whole country. That\r\nthey are local in their advantages, as well as in their construction, is\r\nan objection that has been and will be urged against every measure of\r\nthe kind. In a country so widely extended as ours, so diversified in its\r\ninterests and in the character of its people, it is impossible that the\r\noperation of any measure should affect all alike. Each has its own\r\npeculiar interest, whose advancement it seeks; we have the sea-coast,\r\nand you the noble river that flows at your feet. So it must ever be. Go\r\nto the smallest government in the world, the republic of San Marino, in\r\nItaly, possessing a territory of but ten miles square, and you will find\r\nits citizens, separated but by a few miles, having some interests which,\r\non account of local situation, are separate and distinct. There is not\r\non the face of the earth a plain, five miles in extent, whose\r\ninhabitants are all the same in their pursuits and pleasures. Some will\r\nlive on a creek, others near a hill, which, when any measure is proposed\r\nfor the general benefit, will give rise to jarring claims and opposing\r\ninterests. In such cases, it has always appeared to me that the point to\r\nbe examined was, whether the principle was general. If the principle\r\nwere general, although the application might be partial, I cheerfully\r\nand zealously gave it my support. When an objection has been made to an\r\nappropriation for clearing the snags out of the Ohio River, I have\r\nanswered it with the question, \"Would you not vote for an appropriation\r\nto clear the Atlantic Ocean of snags, were the navigation of your coast\r\nthus obstructed? The people of the West contribute their portion of the\r\nrevenue to fortify your sea-coast, and erect piers, and harbors, and\r\nlight-houses, from which they derive a remote benefit, and why not\r\ncontribute yours to improve the navigation of a river whose commerce\r\nenriches the whole country?\"\r\n\r\nIt may be expected, fellow-citizens, that I should say something on a\r\ntopic which agitates and distracts the public mind, I mean the\r\nderanged state of the currency, and the general stagnation of business.\r\nIn giving my opinions on this topic, I wish it to be distinctly\r\nunderstood, that I force them on no man. I am an independent man,\r\nspeaking to independent men. I think for myself; you, of course, enjoy\r\nand exercise the same right. I cheerfully concede to every one the\r\nliberty of differing with me in sentiment, readily granting that he\r\nhas as good chance of being right as myself, perhaps a better. But I\r\nhave some respect for my character as a public man. The present\r\nstate of things has grown out of a series of measures, to which I have\r\nbeen in uniform opposition. In speaking of their consequences, I am\r\ndoing but justice to myself in showing them in justification of my\r\nconduct. I am performing a duty to my fellow-citizens, who have a\r\nright to know the opinions of every public man. The present state of\r\nthings is unparalleled in the annals of our country. The general\r\nsuspension of specie payments by the banks, beginning I know not\r\nwhere, and ending I know not where, but comprehending the whole\r\ncountry, has produced wide-spread ruin and confusion through the\r\nland. To you the scene is one as yet of apprehension; to us, of deep\r\ndistress. You cannot understand, my fellow-citizens, nor can I describe\r\nit so as to enable you to understand, the embarrassment and suffering\r\nwhich are depressing the spirit and crushing the energies of the people\r\nof the sea-girt States of the East. You are agriculturists, you\r\nproduce what you consume, and always have the means of living within\r\nyour reach. We depend on others for their agricultural productions;\r\nwe live by manufactures and commerce, of which credit is the\r\nlifeblood. The destruction of credit is the destruction of our means\r\nof living. The man who cannot fulfil his daily engagements, or with\r\nwhom others fail to fulfil theirs, must suffer for his daily bread.\r\nAnd who are those who suffer? Not the rich, for they can generally take\r\ncare of themselves. Capital is ingenious and far-sighted, ready in\r\nresources and fertile in expedients to shelter itself from impending\r\nstorms. Shut it out from one source of increase, and it will find\r\nother avenues of profitable investment. It is the industrious, working\r\npart of the community, men whose hands have grown hard by holding the\r\nplough and pulling the oar, men who depend on their daily labor and\r\ntheir daily pay, who, when the operations of trade and commerce are\r\nchecked and palsied, have no prospect for themselves and their families\r\nbut beggary and starvation,--it is these who suffer. All this has\r\nbeen attributed to causes as different as can be imagined; over-trading,\r\nover-buying, over-selling, over-speculating, over-production, terms\r\nwhich I acknowledge I do not very well understand. I am at a loss to\r\nconceive how a nation can become poor by over-production, producing\r\nmore than she can sell or consume. I do not see where there has been\r\nover-trading, except in public lands; for when every thing else was\r\nup to such an enormous price, and the public land tied down to one\r\ndollar and a quarter an acre, who would not have bought it if he could?\r\n\r\nThese causes could not have produced all those consequences which have\r\noccasioned such general lamentation. They must have proceeded from some\r\nother source. And I now request you, my fellow-citizens, to bear\r\nwitness, that here, in this good city, on the banks of the Ohio, on the\r\nfirst day of June, 1837, beneath the bright sun that is shining upon us,\r\nI declare my conscientious conviction that they have proceeded from the\r\nmeasures of the general government in relation to the currency. I make\r\nthis declaration in no spirit of enmity to its authors; I follow no man\r\nwith rebukes or reproaches. To reprobate the past will not alleviate the\r\nevils of the present. It is the duty of every good citizen to contribute\r\nhis strength, however feeble, to diminish the burden under which a\r\npeople groans. To apply the remedy successfully, however, we must first\r\nascertain the causes, character, and extent of the evil.\r\n\r\nLet us go back, then, to its origin. Forty-eight years have elapsed\r\nsince the adoption of our Constitution. For forty years of that time we\r\nhad a national bank. Its establishment originated in the imperious\r\nobligation imposed on every government to furnish its people with a\r\ncirculating medium for their commerce. No matter how rich the citizen\r\nmay be in flocks and herds, in houses and lands, if his government does\r\nnot furnish him a medium of exchange, commerce must be confined to the\r\npetty barter suggested by mutual wants and necessities, as they exist in\r\nsavage life. The history of all commercial countries shows that the\r\nprecious metals can constitute but a small part of this circulating\r\nmedium. The extension of commerce creates a system of credit; the\r\ntransmission of money from one part of the country to the other gives\r\nbirth to the business of exchange. To keep the value of this medium and\r\nthe rates of exchange equal and certain, was imperiously required by the\r\nnecessities of the times when the bank was established. Under the old\r\nconfederacy, each of the thirteen States established and regulated its\r\nown money, which passed for its full value within the State, and was\r\nuseless the moment it crossed the State border. The little State of\r\nRhode Island, for instance, (I hope no son of hers present will take\r\noffence at what I say,) so small that an Indiana man might almost cover\r\nher territory with his hand, was crowded with banks. A man might have\r\nbeen rich at Providence, but before he could travel to Boston, forty\r\nmiles distant, he would starve for want of money to pay for his\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nHad this state of things continued, some of the provisions of the\r\nConstitution would have been of no force or virtue. Of what value to\r\nCongress would have been the right to levy taxes, imposts, and duties,\r\nand to regulate commerce among different States, and of what effect or\r\nconsequence the prohibition on the different States of levying and\r\ncollecting imposts, if each and every one of them had possessed the\r\nright of paying her taxes and duties in a currency of her own, which\r\nwould not pass one hundred miles, perhaps, from the bank whence it was\r\nissued? The creation of a national bank presented the surest means of\r\nremedying these evils, and accomplishing one of the principal objects of\r\nthe Constitution, the establishment and maintenance of a currency whose\r\nvalue would be uniform in every part of the country. During the forty\r\nyears it existed, under the two charters, we had no general suspension\r\nof specie payments, as at present. We got along well with it, and I am\r\none of those who are disposed to let _well_ alone. I am content to\r\ntravel along the good old turnpike on which I have journeyed before with\r\ncomfort and expedition, without turning aside to try a new track. I must\r\nconfess that I do not possess that soaring self-respect, that lofty\r\nconfidence in my own political sagacity and foresight, which would\r\ninduce me to set aside the experience of forty years, and risk the ruin\r\nof the country for the sake of an _experiment_. To this is all the\r\ndistress of the country attributable. This has caused such powerful\r\ninvasions of bank paper, like sudden and succeeding flights of birds of\r\nprey and passage, and the rapid disappearance of specie at its approach.\r\nYou all know that bank-notes have been almost as plenty as the leaves of\r\nthe forest in the summer. But of what value are they to the holder, if\r\nhe is compelled to pay his debts in specie? And who can be expected to\r\npay his debts in this way, when the government has withdrawn the specie\r\nfrom circulation?\r\n\r\nYou have not yet felt the evil in its full extent. It is mostly in\r\nprospect, and you are watching its approach. While you are endeavoring\r\nto guard against it, strive to prevent its future recurrence. As you\r\nwould hunt down, with hound and horn, the wolf who is making nightly\r\nhavoc of your flocks and herds, pursue and keep down those who would\r\nmake havoc in your business and property by experiments on our\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nAlthough the country has bowed beneath the pressure, I do not fear that\r\nit will be broken down and prostrated in the dust. Depress them as it\r\nmay, the energy and industry of the people will enable them to rise\r\nagain. We have for a long time carried a load of bad government on our\r\nshoulders, and we are still able to bear up under it. But I do not see\r\nthat, for that reason, we should be willing and eager to carry it. I do\r\nnot see why it should prevent us from wishing to lessen it as much as\r\npossible, if not to throw it off altogether, when we know that we can\r\nget along so much easier and faster without it. While we are exerting\r\nourselves with renewed industry and economy to recover from its\r\nblighting effects, while we plough the land and plough the sea, let us\r\nhasten the return of things to their proper state, by such political\r\nmeasures as will best accomplish the desired end. Let us inform our\r\npublic servants of our wishes, and pursue such a course as will compel\r\nthem to obey us.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, my fellow-citizens, I return you my thanks for the\r\npatience and attention with which you have listened to me, and pray the\r\nbeneficent Giver of all good, that he may keep you under the shadow of\r\nhis wing, and continue to bless you with peace and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n  [110] A Speech delivered at Madison, in the State of Indiana, on the\r\n        first of June 1837, on Occasion of a Public Reception by the\r\n        Citizens of that Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC DINNER IN FANEUIL HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE.\r\n\r\n  On the return of Mr. Webster from the session in which he had\r\n  particularly signalized himself by the delivery of his masterly\r\n  speeches on the sub-treasury bill, and in reply to Mr. Calhoun\r\n  (contained in a subsequent volume of this collection), a large\r\n  number of his fellow-citizens of Boston could not be restrained from\r\n  manifesting their sense of his extraordinary efforts, in exhibiting\r\n  the true character of the odious sub-treasury project, and in\r\n  procuring its ultimate rejection by Congress. He was accordingly\r\n  invited to meet them at a public dinner, on the 24th of July, 1838.\r\n  More than fifteen hundred persons attended it, every ticket having\r\n  been eagerly taken as soon as issued. Every portion of the Hall,\r\n  floor and galleries, was filled. The Governor of the Commonwealth\r\n  (Hon. Edward Everett) presided at the table, and the spirit of the\r\n  occasion and of the company may be gathered from the following\r\n  remarks with which he introduced Mr. Webster to the assembly:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And now, fellow-citizens,\" said he, \"I rise to discharge the most\r\npleasing part of my duty, which I fear you will think I have too long\r\npostponed; the duty which devolves on me, as the organ of your feelings\r\ntoward our distinguished guest, the senior Senator of the Commonwealth.\r\nAnd yet, fellow-citizens, I appeal to you, that I have approached this\r\nduty through the succession of ideas which most naturally conducts our\r\nminds and hearts to the grateful topic. I have proposed to you, Our\r\ncountry and its prosperity. Who among the great men, his contemporaries,\r\nhas more widely surveyed and comprehended the various interests of all\r\nits parts? I have proposed, The Union of the States. What public man is\r\nthere living, whose political course has been more steadily consecrated\r\nto its perpetuity? I have proposed to you, The Constitution. And who of\r\nour statesmen, from the time of its framers, has more profoundly\r\ninvestigated, more clearly expounded, more powerfully vindicated and\r\nsustained it? But these topics I may pass over. They are matters which\r\nhave been long familiar to you; they need not any comment from me.\r\n\r\n\"The events of the last year, and of the last session of Congress, and\r\nthe present state of the country, invite our attention more particularly\r\nto the recent efforts of our distinguished guest on the subject of THE\r\nCURRENCY. I know not but some persons may think that undue importance\r\nhas been attached to the questions which have divided parties on this\r\nsubject; that these questions are not so vital to liberty as they have\r\nbeen represented. But such an opinion would be erroneous. Undoubtedly\r\nthere are countries, not free ones, in which money questions, as\r\nconnected with the government, are of minor consequence. In China, in\r\nTurkey, in Persia, I presume they are very little discussed. In these\r\ncountries the great question is, whether a man's head at night will be\r\nfound in the same pleasing and convenient proximity to his shoulders\r\nthat it was in the morning; and this is a kind of previous question,\r\nwhich, if decided against him, cuts off all others. Under those\r\narbitrary governments of Europe, where the prince takes what he pleases,\r\nand when he pleases, it is of very little moment where he deposits it,\r\non its way from the pockets of the people to his own. But it was\r\nremarked by Edmund Burke, more than seventy years ago, that in England,\r\n(and _a fortiori_ in the United States, that is, under constitutional\r\ngovernments,) the great struggles for liberty had been almost always\r\nmoney questions, and on this ground he excused the Americans for the\r\nstand they took in opposition to a paltry tax. But, most certainly, the\r\nmoney question, as it has been agitated among us, is vastly more\r\nimportant, more intimately connected with constitutional liberty, than\r\nthat which brought on the Revolution. The question with our fathers was\r\none of a small tax; ours, of the entire currency. Theirs concerned three\r\npence per pound on tea, illegally levied; ours, the entire currency\r\nillegally disposed of, the entire medium of circulation deranged, and\r\nfor a period annihilated, the whole business of the country, in all its\r\ngreat branches, brought under the control of the treasury. The noble\r\nstand, therefore, taken by our distinguished Senator in this controversy\r\nhas been upon points which concern the dearest interests of the people,\r\nand the elemental principles of the government.\r\n\r\n\"In fact, I know not that a policy can be imagined more at war with\r\nthe true character of the government, than that which he has been\r\ncalled to combat. The past and present administrations, relying too\r\nconfidently on the popular delusions which brought them into office,\r\nhave systematically defeated one of the great original objects for\r\nwhich the Union was framed, that of a uniform medium of commerce. Nor\r\nhas the manner of their policy been less objectionable than its\r\ndesign. They have crowded experiment upon experiment, with the fatal\r\nrecklessness of the rash engineer who urges the fires in his furnaces\r\ntill some noble steamer bursts in an awful explosion.[111] Our Senators\r\nand Representatives, and their associates, could they have forgotten\r\nthat a revered Constitution and a beloved country were the chief\r\nvictims, might well have folded their arms, and left the authors of\r\nthe calamity to extricate themselves, as best they might, from the\r\nruin. But not thus have they understood their duty; and we have seen\r\nthem with admiration, in the last days of the session, gallantly\r\nputting out in the life-boat of the Constitution, with an eye of\r\nfire at the top, and an arm of iron at the helm, to cruise about on the\r\nboiling waters, and pick up all that is left undestroyed. When I have\r\nseen the adherents of the administration rejecting, so far as they\r\nventured, the salutary measures proposed or supported by our\r\ndistinguished guest and his associates, for the restoration of the\r\ncurrency and the reestablishment of the public credit, and clinging to\r\nall that events have spared of their discredited measures, they have\r\nseemed to me to resemble the sun-stricken victims of a moody madness,\r\nwho, instead of thankfully embracing the proffered relief, would\r\nprefer to float about on the weltering waters, clinging to the broken\r\nplanks and the shivered splinters of their exploded policy, sure as\r\nthey are, at the very best, if they reach solid ground, to do so\r\nbeneath the overwhelming surge of popular indignation.\r\n\r\n\"I should take up a great deal more time than belongs to me, did I\r\nattempt even to sketch the distinguished services of our friend and\r\nguest in this constitutional warfare. They are impressed on your\r\nmemories, and on your hearts. In the thickest of the conflict, his\r\nplume, like that of Henry the Fourth of France, discerned from afar, has\r\npointed out the spot where, to use his own language, 'the blows fall\r\nthickest and hardest'; and there he has been found, with the banner of\r\nthe Union above his head, and the flaming cimeter of the Constitution in\r\nhis hand. If the public mind has been thoroughly awakened to the\r\ninconsistency of the government policy with the genius of our\r\ninstitutions, if, to the experience we have all had of the pernicious\r\noperation of this policy, there has been added a clear understanding of\r\nthe false principles, as well of constitutional law as of political\r\neconomy, on which it rests, how much of this is not fairly to be\r\nascribed to the efforts of our distinguished guest, efforts never\r\nstinted in or out of Congress, repeated in every form which can persuade\r\nthe judgment or influence the conduct of men, never less than cogent,\r\neloquent, irrefutable, but in the last session of Congress, perhaps more\r\nthan ever before, grand, masterly, and overwhelming. It has indeed been\r\na rare, I had almost said a sublime spectacle, to see him, unsupported\r\nby a majority in either house, opposed by the entire influence of the\r\ngovernment, denounced by the administration press from one end of the\r\nUnion to the other, yet carrying resolution after resolution against the\r\nadministration, carrying them alike against the old guard and the new\r\nrecruits, and, notwithstanding their abrupt and ill-compacted alliance,\r\ncompelling them, in spite of themselves, to afford some relief to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"These are the services, fellow-citizens, for which you this day\r\ntender your thanks to your distinguished guest. These are the\r\nservices for which, Sir, on behalf of my fellow-citizens, I thank you;\r\nfor which they thank you themselves. Behold, Sir, how they rise to\r\npay you a manly homage.[112] The armies of Napoleon could not coerce it;\r\nthe wealth of the Indies could not buy it; but it is freely, joyously\r\npaid, by fifteen hundred freemen, to the man of their affections. They\r\nthank you for having stood by them in these dark times,--at all times.\r\nThey thank you, because they think they are beginning to feel the fruit\r\nof your exertions in the daily round of their pursuits. They ascribe it\r\nin no small degree to you, that the iron grasp of the government\r\npolicy has been relaxed; that its bolts and chains, relics of a\r\nbarbarous age, have been shivered as soon as forged, and before they\r\nwere riveted on the necks of the people. They thank you for having\r\nstood by the Constitution, in which their all of human hope for\r\nthemselves and their children is enshrined. They thank you as one of\r\nthemselves; and because they know that your affections are with the\r\npeople from which you sprung. They thank you because you have at all\r\ntimes shown, that, as the Whig blood of the Revolution circles in your\r\nveins, the Whig principles of the Revolution are imprinted on your\r\nheart. They thank you for the entire manliness of your course; that\r\nyou have never joined the treacherous cry of the 'hatred of the poor\r\nagainst the rich,'--a cry raised by artful men, who think to flatter the\r\npeople, while in reality they are waging war against the people's\r\nbusiness, the people's prosperity, and the people's Constitution.\r\nThey are willing that this day's offering should be remembered, when\r\nall this mighty multitude shall have passed from the stage. When\r\nthat day shall have arrived, history will have written your name on\r\none of her brightest pages; fame will have encircled your bust with\r\nher greenest laurels; but neither history nor fame will have paid you a\r\ntruer, heartier tribute, than that which now, beneath the arches of\r\nthis venerable hall, in the approving presence of these images of our\r\ncanonized fathers, is tendered you by this great company of your\r\nfellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n\"I give you, Gentlemen,--\r\n\r\n\"DANIEL WEBSTER,--the statesman and the man; whose name is engraven\r\nalike on the pillars of the Constitution and the hearts of his\r\nfellow-citizens. He is worthy of that place in the councils of the\r\nnation which he fills in the affections of the people.\"\r\n\r\n  Mr. Webster then rose, amidst enthusiastic cheering, and addressed\r\n  the meeting in the following speech.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n  [111] The disaster of the Pulaski occurred about the time of the\r\n        delivery of these remarks.\r\n\r\n  [112] The entire audience rose at this moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC DINNER IN FANEUIL HALL.[113]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--I shall be happy indeed, if the state of my health and the\r\ncondition of my voice shall enable me to express, in a few words, my\r\ndeep and heartfelt gratitude for this expression of your approbation. If\r\npublic life has its cares and its trials, it has occasionally its\r\nconsolations also. Among these, one of the greatest, and the chief, is\r\nthe approbation of those whom we have honestly endeavored to serve. This\r\ncup of consolation you have now administered,--full, crowned, abundantly\r\noverflowing.\r\n\r\nIt is my chief desire at this time, in a few spontaneous and\r\naffectionate words, to render you the thanks of a grateful heart. When I\r\nlately received your invitation in New York, nothing was farther from my\r\nthoughts or expectations, than that I should meet such an assembly as I\r\nnow behold in Boston.\r\n\r\nBut I was willing to believe that it was not meant merely as a\r\ncompliment, which it was expected would be declined, but that it was in\r\ntruth your wish, at the close of the labors of a long session of\r\nCongress, that I should meet you in this place, that we might mingle our\r\nmutual congratulations, and that we might enjoy together one happy,\r\nsocial hour.\r\n\r\nThe president of this assembly has spoken of the late session as having\r\nbeen not only long, but arduous; and, in some respects, it does deserve\r\nto be so regarded. I may indeed say, that, in an experience of twenty\r\nyears of public life, I have never yet encountered labors or anxieties\r\nsuch as this session brought with it.\r\n\r\nWith a short intermission in the autumn, so short as not to allow the\r\nmore distant members to visit their homes, we have been in continual\r\nsession from the early part of September to the 9th of July, a period of\r\nten months.[114] On our part, during this whole time, we have been\r\ncontending in minorities against majorities; majorities, indeed, not to\r\nbe relied on for all measures, as the event has proved, but still\r\nacknowledged and avowed majorities, professing general attachment and\r\nsupport to the measures, and to the men, of the administration. My own\r\nobject, and that of those with whom I have had the honor to act, has\r\nbeen steady and uniform. That object was, to resist new theories, new\r\nschemes, new and dangerous projects, until time could be gained for\r\ntheir consideration by the people. This was our great purpose, and its\r\naccomplishment required no slight effort. It was the commencement of a\r\nnew Congress. The organization of the two houses showed clear and\r\ndecisive administration majorities. The administration itself was new,\r\nand had come into its fresh power with something of the popularity of\r\nthat which preceded it. It was no child's play, therefore, to resist,\r\nsuccessfully, its leading measures, for so long a period as should allow\r\ntime for an effectual appeal to the people, pressed, as those measures\r\nwere, with the utmost zeal and assiduity.\r\n\r\nThe president of the day has alluded in a very flattering manner to my\r\nown exertions and efforts, made at different times, in connection with\r\nthe leading topics. But I claim no particular merit for myself. In what\r\nI have done, I have only acted with others. I have acted, especially,\r\nwith my most estimable, able, and excellent colleague,[115] and with\r\nthe experienced and distinguished men who form the delegation of\r\nMassachusetts in the House of Representatives, a delegation of which\r\nany State might be justly proud. We have acted together, as men\r\nholding, in almost all cases, common opinions, and laboring for a\r\ncommon end. It gives me great pleasure to have the honor of seeing so\r\nmany of the Representatives of the State in Congress here to-day; but I\r\nmust not be prevented, even by their presence, from bearing my humble\r\nbut hearty testimony to the fidelity and ability with which they have,\r\nin this arduous struggle, performed their public duties. The crisis has,\r\nindeed, demanded the efforts of all; and we of Massachusetts, while we\r\nhope we have done our duty, have done it only in concurrence with\r\nother Whigs, whose zeal, ability, and exertions can never be too much\r\ncommended.\r\n\r\nThis is not an occasion in which it is fit or practicable to discuss\r\nvery minutely, and at length, the questions which have been chiefly\r\nagitated during this long and laborious session of Congress. Yet, so\r\nimportant is the great and general question, which, for the last twelve\r\nor fifteen months, has been presented to the consideration of the\r\nlegislature, that I deem it proper, on this, as on all occasions, to\r\nstate, at the risk of some repetition, perhaps, what is the nature of\r\nthat important question, and briefly to advert to some of the\r\ncircumstances in which it had its origin.\r\n\r\nWhatever subordinate questions may have been raised touching a\r\nsub-treasury, or a constitutional treasury, or a treasury in one, or in\r\nanother, or in yet a third form, I take the question, the plain, the\r\nparamount, the practical question, to be this; namely, whether it be\r\namong the powers and the duties of Congress to take any further care of\r\nthe national currency than to regulate the coinage of gold and silver.\r\nThat question lies at the foundation of all. Other questions, however\r\nmultiplied or varied, have but grown out of that.\r\n\r\nIf government is bound to take care that there is a good currency for\r\nall the country, then, of course, it will have a good currency for\r\nitself, and need take no especial pains to provide for itself any thing\r\npeculiar. But if, on the other hand, government is at liberty to abandon\r\nthe general currency to its fate, without concern and without remorse,\r\nthen, from necessity, it must take care of itself; amidst the general\r\nwreck of currency and credit, it must have places of resort and a system\r\nof shelter; it must have a currency of its own, and modes of payment and\r\ndisbursement peculiar to itself. It must burrow and hide itself in\r\nsub-treasury vaults. Scorning credit, and having trust in nobody, it\r\nmust grasp metallic money, and act as if nothing represented, or could\r\nrepresent, property, which could not be counted, paid piece by piece, or\r\nweighed in the scales, and made to ring upon the table; or it must\r\nresort to special deposits in banks, even in those banks whose conduct\r\nhas been so loudly denounced as flagitious and criminal, treacherous to\r\nthe government, and fraudulent towards the people. All these schemes and\r\ncontrivances are but the consequences of the general doctrine which the\r\nadministration has advanced, and attempted to recommend to the country;\r\nthat is, that Congress has nothing to do with the currency, beyond the\r\nmere matter of coinage, except to provide for itself. How such a notion\r\nshould come to be entertained, at this day, may well be a matter of\r\nwonder for the wise; since it is a truth capable of the clearest\r\ndemonstration, that, from the first day of the existence of the\r\nConstitution, from the moment when a practical administration of\r\ngovernment drew a first breath under its provisions, the superintendence\r\nand care over the currency of the country have been admitted to be among\r\nthe clear and unquestioned powers and duties of Congress. This was the\r\nopinion in Washington's time, and his administration acted upon it,\r\nvigorously and successfully. And in Mr. Madison's time, when the\r\npeculiar circumstances of the country again brought up the subject, and\r\ngave it new importance, it was held to be the exclusive, or at least the\r\nparamount and unquestioned, right of Congress to take care of the\r\ncurrency; to restore it when depreciated; to see that there was a sound,\r\nconvertible paper circulation, suited to the circumstances of the\r\ncountry, and having equal value, and the same credit, in all parts of\r\nit. This was Mr. Madison's judgment. He acted upon it; and both houses\r\nof Congress concurred with him. But if we now quote Mr. Madison's\r\nsentiments, we get no reply at all from the friends of the government\r\nsystem. We may read his messages of 1815 and 1816 as often as we please.\r\nNo man answers them, and yet the party of the administration, professing\r\nto belong to Mr. Madison's political school, acts upon directly opposite\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nNow, what has brought about this state of things? What has caused this\r\nattempt, now made, at the end of half a century, to change a great\r\nprinciple of administration, and to surrender a most important power of\r\nthe government? Gentlemen, it has been a crisis of party, not of the\r\ncountry, which has given birth to these new sentiments. The tortuous\r\nwindings of party policy have conducted us, and nothing else could well\r\nhave conducted us, to such a point. Nothing but party pledges, nothing\r\nbut courses of political conduct entered upon for party purposes, and\r\npursued from necessary regard to personal and party consistency, could\r\nso far have pushed the government out of its clear and well-trodden path\r\nof constitutional duty. From General Washington's presidency to the last\r\nhour of the late President's, both the government and the country have\r\nsupposed Congress to be clothed with the general duty of protecting the\r\ncurrency, either as an inference from the coinage power or from the\r\nobvious and incontestable truth, that the regulation of the currency is\r\nnaturally and plainly a branch of the commercial power. General Jackson\r\nhimself was behind no one of his predecessors in asserting this power,\r\nand in acknowledging the corresponding duty. We all know that his very\r\nfirst complaint against the late Bank of the United States was, that it\r\nhad not fulfilled the expectation of the country, by furnishing for the\r\nuse of the people a sound and uniform currency. There were many persons,\r\ncertainly, who did not agree with him in his opinions respecting the\r\nbank and the effects of its agency on the country; but it was expressly\r\non the ground of this alleged failure of the bank, that he undertook\r\nwhat was called the great reform. There are those, again, who think that\r\nof this attempted reform he made a very poor and sorry business; but\r\nstill the truth is, that he undertook this reform for the very purpose\r\nprofessed and avowed, that he might fulfil better than it had yet been\r\nfulfilled the duty of government in furnishing the people with a good\r\ncurrency. The President thought that the currency, in 1832 and 1833, was\r\nnot good enough; that the people had a right to expect a better; and to\r\nmeet this expectation, he began what he himself called his experiment.\r\nHe said the currency was not so sound, and so uniform, as it was the\r\nduty of government to make it; and he therefore undertook to give us a\r\ncurrency more sound and more uniform. And now, Gentlemen, let us recur\r\nshortly to what followed; for there we shall find the origin of the\r\npresent constitutional notions and dogmas. Let us see what has changed\r\nthe Constitution in this particular.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, the public deposits were removed, by an act of the President\r\nhimself, from the Bank of the United States, and placed in certain State\r\nbanks, under regulations prescribed by the executive alone. This was the\r\nexperiment. The utmost confidence, indeed, an arrogant and intolerant\r\nconfidence, was entertained and expressed of its success; and all who\r\ndoubted were regarded as blind bigots to a national bank. When the\r\nexperiment was put into operation, it was proclaimed that its success\r\nwas found to be complete. Down to the very close of General Jackson's\r\nadministration, we heard of nothing but the wonderful success of the\r\nexperiment. It was declared, from the highest official sources, that the\r\nState banks, used as banks of deposit, had not only shown themselves\r\nperfectly competent to fulfil the duties of fiscal agents to government,\r\nbut also that they had sustained the currency, and facilitated the great\r\nbusiness of internal exchanges, with the most singular and gratifying\r\nsuccess, and better than the same thing had been done before. In all\r\nthis glow and fervor of self-commendation, the late administration went\r\nout of office, having bequeathed the experiment, with all its blushing\r\nhonors and rising glories, to its successor. But a frost, a nipping\r\nfrost, was at hand. Two months after General Jackson had retired, the\r\nbanks suspended specie payments, deposit banks and all; a universal\r\nembarrassment smote down the business and industry of the country; the\r\ntreasury was left without a dollar, and the brilliant glory of the\r\nexperiment disappeared in gloom and thick darkness! And now, Gentlemen,\r\ncame the change of sentiments, now came the new reading of the\r\nConstitution. A national bank had already been declared by the party to\r\nbe unconstitutional, the State bank system had failed, and what more\r\ncould be done? What other plan was to be devised? How could the duty of\r\ngovernment over the currency be now performed? The administration had\r\ndecried a national bank, and it now felt bound to denounce all State\r\ninstitutions; and what, therefore, could it do? The whole party had laid\r\nout its entire strength, in an effort to render the late Bank of the\r\nUnited States, and any bank of the United States, unpopular and odious.\r\nIt had pronounced all such institutions to be dangerous, anti-republican\r\nand monarchical. It had, especially, declared a national bank to be\r\nplainly and clearly unconstitutional. Now, Gentlemen, I have nothing to\r\nsay of the diffidence and modesty of men, who without hesitation or\r\nblushing, set up their own favorite opinions on a question of this kind\r\nagainst the judgment of the government and the judgment of the country,\r\nmaintained for fifty years. I will only remark, that, if we were to find\r\nmen acting thus in their own affairs, if we should find them disposing\r\nof their own interests, or making arrangements for their own property,\r\nin contempt of rules which they knew the legislative and the judicial\r\nauthorities had all sanctioned for half a century, we should be very\r\nlikely to think them out of their heads. Yet this ground had been taken\r\nagainst the late bank, and against all national banks; and it could not\r\nbe surrendered without apparent and gross inconsistency. What, then, I\r\nask again, was the administration to do? You may say, it should have\r\nretracted its error, it should have seen the necessity of a national\r\ninstitution, and yielded to the general judgment of the country.\r\n\r\nBut that would have required an effort of candor and magnanimity, of\r\nwhich all men are not capable. Besides, there were open, solemn, public\r\npledges in the way. This commitment of the party against a national\r\nbank, and the disastrous results of its experiment on the State\r\ninstitutions, brought the party into a difficulty, from which it seemed\r\nto have no escape, but in shifting off, altogether, the duty of taking\r\ncare of the currency. I was at Wheeling, in Virginia, in May of last\r\nyear, when the banks suspended payment; and, at the risk of some\r\nimputation of bad taste, I will refer to observations of mine made then,\r\nto the citizens of that town, and published, in regard to the questions\r\nwhich that event would necessarily bring before the country.[116] I saw\r\nat once that we were at the commencement of a new era, and that a\r\ncontroversy must arise, which would greatly excite the community.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the State banks suspended specie payments, and among the\r\nrest those which were depositories of the government, than a cry of\r\nfraud and treachery was raised against them, with no better reason,\r\nperhaps, than existed for that loud, and boisterous, and boastful\r\nconfidence, with which the late administration had spoken of their\r\ncapacity of usefulness, and had assured the country that its experiment\r\ncould not fail. But whether the suspension by the banks was a matter of\r\nnecessity with them, or not, the administration, after it had happened,\r\nseeing itself now shut out from the use of all banks by its own declared\r\nopinions and the results of its own policy, and seeing no means at hand\r\nfor making another attempt at reforming the currency, turned a short\r\ncorner, and in all due form denied that the government had any duty of\r\nthe kind to discharge. From the time of the veto of the bank charter, in\r\n1832, the administration had been like a man who had voluntarily\r\ndeserted a safe bottom, on deep waters, and, having in vain sought to\r\nsupport himself by laying hold on one and another piece of floating\r\ntimber, chooses rather to go down than to seek safety in returning to\r\nwhat he has abandoned.\r\n\r\nSeeing that it had deprived itself of the common means of regulating\r\nthe currency, it now denied its obligation to do so; declared it had\r\nnothing to do with the currency beyond coinage; that it would take\r\ncare of the revenues of the government, and as for the rest, the people\r\nmust look out for themselves. This decision thus evidently grew out of\r\nparty necessity. Having deprived themselves of the ordinary and\r\nconstitutional means of performing their duty, they sought to avoid\r\nthe responsibility by declaring that there was no such duty to\r\nperform. They have looked further into the Constitution, and examined it\r\nby daylight and by moonlight, and cannot find any such duty or\r\nobligation. Though General Jackson saw it very plainly, during the\r\nwhole course of his presidency, it has now vanished, and the new\r\ncommentators can nowhere discern a vestige of it. The present\r\nadministration, indeed, stood pledged to tread in the steps of its\r\npredecessor; but here was one footprint which it could not, or would\r\nnot, occupy, or one stride too long for it to take. The message, I had\r\nalmost said the fatal message, communicated to Congress in September,\r\ncontained a formal disavowal, by the administration, of all power\r\nunder the Constitution to regulate the general actual currency of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe President says, in that message, that if he refrains from suggesting\r\nto Congress any specific plan for regulating the exchanges, relieving\r\nmercantile embarrassments, or interfering with the ordinary operations\r\nof foreign or domestic commerce, it is from the conviction that such\r\nmeasures are not within the constitutional provision of government.\r\n\r\nHow all this could be said, when the Constitution expressly gives to\r\nCongress the power to regulate commerce, both foreign and domestic, I\r\ncannot conceive. But the Constitution was not to be trifled with, and\r\nthe people are not to be trifled with. The country, I believe, by a\r\ngreat majority, is of opinion that this duty _does belong_ to\r\ngovernment, and ought to be exercised. All the new expounders have not\r\nbeen able to erase this general power over commerce, and all that\r\nbelongs to commerce. Their fate, in this respect, is like that of him in\r\nancient story. While endeavoring to tear up and rend asunder the\r\nConstitution, its strong fibres have recoiled, and caught them in the\r\ncleft. They experience\r\n\r\n              \"Milo's fearful end,\r\n  Wedged in the timber which they strove to rend.\"\r\n\r\nGentlemen, this constitutional power can never be surrendered. We may as\r\nwell give up the whole commercial power at once, and throw every thing\r\nconnected with it back upon the States. If Congress surrender the power,\r\nto whom shall it pass, or where shall it be lodged? Shall it be left to\r\nsix-and-twenty different legislatures? To eight hundred or a thousand\r\nunconnected State banks? No, Gentlemen, to allow that authority to be\r\nsurrendered would be to abandon the vessel of state, without pilot or\r\nhelm, and to suffer her to roll, darkling, down the current of her\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of avoiding all misapprehensions on this most important\r\nsubject, I wish to state my own opinion, clearly, and in few words. I\r\nhave never said, that it is an indispensable duty in Congress, under all\r\ncircumstances, to establish a national bank. No such duty, certainly, is\r\ncreated by the Constitution, in express terms. I did not say _what\r\nparticular measures_ are enjoined by the Constitution, in this respect.\r\nCongress has its discretion, and is left to its own judgment, as to the\r\nmeans most proper to be employed. But I say the general duty does\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nI maintain that Congress is bound to take care, by some proper means, to\r\nsecure a good currency for the people; and that, while this duty remains\r\nunperformed, one great object of the Constitution is not attained. If we\r\nare to have as many different currencies as there are States, and these\r\ncurrencies are to be liable to perpetual fluctuation, it would be folly\r\nto say that we had reached that security and uniformity in commercial\r\nregulation, which we know it was the purpose of the Constitution to\r\nestablish.\r\n\r\nThe banks may all resume specie payments to-morrow,--I hope they will;\r\nbut how much will this resumption accomplish? It will doubtless afford\r\ngood local currencies; but will it give the country any proper and safe\r\npaper currency, of equal and universal value? Certainly it cannot, and\r\nwill not. Will it bring back, for any length of time, exchanges to the\r\nstate they were in when there was a national currency in existence?\r\nCertainly, in my opinion, it will not. We may heap gold bags upon gold\r\nbags, we may create what securities, in the constitution of local banks,\r\nwe please, but we cannot give to any such bank a character that shall\r\ninsure the receipt of its notes, with equal readiness, everywhere\r\nthroughout the valley of the Mississippi, and from the shores of the\r\nGulf of Mexico to the St. Lawrence. Nothing can accomplish this, but an\r\ninstitution which is national in its character. The people desire to\r\nsee, in their currency, the marks of this nationality. They like to see\r\nthe spread eagle, and where they see that they have confidence.\r\n\r\nWho, if he will look at the present state of things, is not wise\r\nenough to see that there is much and deep cause for fear in regard\r\nto the future, unless the government will take the subject of\r\ncurrency under its own control, as it ought to do. For one, I think I\r\nsee trouble ahead, and I look for effectual prevention and remedy\r\nonly to a just exercise of the powers of Congress. I look not without\r\napprehension upon the creation of numerous and powerful State\r\ninstitutions, full of competition and rivalry, and under no common\r\ncontrol. I look for other and often-repeated expansions of paper\r\ncirculation, inflations of trade, and general excess; and then, again,\r\nfor other violent ebbings of the swollen flood, ending in other\r\nsuspensions. I see no steadiness, no security, till the government of\r\nthe United States shall fulfil its constitutional duty. I shall be\r\ndisappointed, certainly, if, for any length of time, the benefits of a\r\nsound and uniform convertible paper currency can be enjoyed, while the\r\nwhole subject is left to six-and-twenty States, and to eight hundred\r\nlocal banks, all anxious for the use of money and the use of credit in\r\nthe highest degree.\r\n\r\nAs I have already said, these sub-treasury schemes are but contrivances\r\nfor getting away from a disagreeable duty. And, after all, there are\r\nscarcely any two of the friends of the administration who can agree\r\nupon the same sub-treasury scheme. Each has a plan of his own. One man\r\nrequires that all banks shall be discarded, and nothing but gold and\r\nsilver shall be received for revenue. Another will exclaim, \"That won't\r\ndo; that's not my thunder.\" Another would prohibit all the small notes,\r\nand another would banish all the large ones. Another is for a special\r\ndeposit scheme; for making the banks sub-treasuries and depositories;\r\nfor making sub-treasuries of the broken, rotten, treacherous banks; for\r\ntaking bank-notes, tying them up with red strings, depositing them in\r\nthe vaults, and paying them out again.\r\n\r\nIt has been the proposition of the administration to separate the money\r\nof the government from the money of the people; to secure a good medium\r\nof payments, for the use of the treasury, in collecting and disbursing\r\nrevenue, and to take no care of the general circulation of the country.\r\nThis is the sum of its policy. Looking upon this whole scheme but as an\r\nabandonment of clear constitutional obligation, I have opposed it, in\r\nevery form in which it has been presented. My object, as I have already\r\nsaid, and that of those with whom I acted, has been, to prevent the\r\nsanction of all or any of these new projects, by authority of law, until\r\nanother Congress should be elected, which might express the will of the\r\npeople formed after the present state of things arose. In this object we\r\nhave succeeded. If we have done little positive good, we have at least\r\nprevented the introduction and establishment of new theories and new\r\ncontrivances, and we have preserved the Constitution, in this respect,\r\nentire. No surrender or abandonment of important powers is, as yet,\r\nindorsed on the parchment of that instrument. No new clause is appended\r\nto it, making its provisions a mere _non obstante_ to executive\r\ndiscretion. It has been snatched from the furnace. From this furnace of\r\nparty contention, heated seven times hotter than it has been wont to be\r\nheated, the Constitution has been rescued, and we may hold it up to the\r\npeople this day, and tell them that even the smell of the fire is not\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nBut now, Gentlemen, a stronger arm must be put forth. A mightier\r\nguardianship must now interfere. Time has been gained for public\r\ndiscussion and consideration, and the great result is now with the\r\npeople. That they will ultimately decide right, I have the fullest\r\nconfidence. Party attachment and party patronage, it is true, may do\r\nmuch to delay the results of general opinion, but they cannot long\r\nresist the convictions of a whole people. It is most certain that, up to\r\nthe present hour, this new policy has been most unfavorably received.\r\nState after State has fallen off from the ranks of the administration,\r\non account of its promulgation, and of the persevering attempt to raise\r\nupon it a system of legal, practical administration. The message of\r\nSeptember completed the list of causes necessary to produce a popular\r\nrevolution in sentiment in Maine, Ohio, New Jersey, and New York. Since\r\nthe proposition was renewed, at the late session, we have witnessed a\r\nsimilar revolution in Connecticut and Louisiana, and very important\r\nchanges, perhaps equivalent to revolutions, in the strength of parties\r\nin other States. There is little reason to doubt, if all the electors of\r\nthe country could be polled to-day, that a great and decisive majority\r\nwould be found against all this strange policy. Yet, Gentlemen, I do not\r\nconsider the question, by any means, as decided. The policy is not\r\nabandoned. It is to be persisted in. Its friends look for a reaction in\r\npublic opinion. I think I understand their hopes and expectations. They\r\nrely on this _reaction_. Every thing is to be accomplished by\r\n_reaction_. A month ago, this reaction was looked for to show itself in\r\nLouisiana. Altogether disappointed in that quarter, the friends of the\r\npolicy now stretch their hopes to the other extremity of the Union, and\r\nlook for it in Maine. In my opinion, Gentlemen, there can be no reaction\r\nwhich can reconcile the people of this country to the policy at present\r\npursued.\r\n\r\nThere must, in my opinion, be a change. If the administration will not\r\nchange its course, it must be changed itself. But I repeat, that the\r\ndecision now lies with the people; and in that decision, when it shall\r\nbe fairly pronounced, I shall cheerfully acquiesce. We ought to address\r\nourselves, on this great and vital question, to the whole people, to the\r\ncandid and intelligent of all parties. We should exhibit its magnitude,\r\nits essential consequence to the Constitution, and its infinite\r\nsuperiority to all ordinary strifes of party. We may well and truly say,\r\nthat it is a new question; that the great mass of the people, of any\r\nparty, is not committed on it; and it is our duty to invoke all true\r\npatriots, all who wish for the well-being of the government and the\r\ncountry, to resist these experiments upon the Constitution, and this\r\nwild and strange departure from our hitherto approved and successful\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Gentlemen, while we thus invoke aid from all quarters,\r\nwe must not suffer ourselves to be deceived. We must yield to no\r\nexpedients, to no schemes and projects unknown to the Constitution, and\r\nalien to our own history and our habits. We are to be saved, if saved at\r\nall, _in_ the Constitution, not _out_ of it. None can aid us, none can\r\naid the country, by any thing in the nature of mere political project,\r\nnor can any _devices_ supply the place of regular constitutional\r\nadministration. It was to prevent, or to remedy, such a state of things\r\nas now exists, that the Constitution was formed and adopted. The time\r\nwhen there is a disordered currency, and a distracted commerce, is the\r\nvery time when its agency is required; and I hope those who wish for a\r\nrestoration of general prosperity will look steadily to the light which\r\nthe Constitution sheds on the path of duty.\r\n\r\nAs to you and me, fellow-citizens, our course is not doubtful. However\r\nothers may decide, we hold on to the Constitution, and to all its\r\npowers, as they have been authentically expounded, and practically and\r\nsuccessfully experienced, for a long period. Our interests, our habits,\r\nour affections, all bind us to the principles of our Union as our\r\nleading and guiding star.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I cannot resume my seat without again expressing my sense of\r\ngratitude for your generous appreciation of my services. I have the\r\npleasure to know that this festival originated with the Boston\r\nmechanics, a body always distinguished, always honored, always\r\npatriotic, from the first dawn of the Revolution to the present time.\r\nWho is here, whose father has not told him--there are some here old\r\nenough to know it themselves--that they were Boston mechanics whose\r\nblood reddened State Street on the memorable 5th of March. And as the\r\ntendencies of the Revolution went forward, and times grew more and more\r\ncritical, it was the Boston mechanics who composed, to a great extent,\r\nthe crowds which frequented the old Whig head-quarters in Union Street;\r\nwhich assembled, as occasion required patriots to come together, in the\r\nOld South; or filled to suffocation this immortal Cradle of American\r\nLiberty.\r\n\r\nWhen Independence was achieved, their course was alike intelligent,\r\nwise, and patriotic. They saw, as quick and as fully as any men in the\r\ncountry, the infirmities of the old Confederation, and discerned the\r\nmeans by which they might be remedied. From the first, they were ardent\r\nand zealous friends of the present Constitution. They saw the necessity\r\nof united councils, and common regulations, for all the States, in\r\nmatters of trade and commerce. They saw, what indeed is obvious enough,\r\nthat their interest was completely involved with that of the mercantile\r\nclass, and other classes; and that nothing but one general, uniform\r\nsystem of commerce, trade, and imports could possibly give to the\r\nbusiness and industry of the country vigor and prosperity. When the\r\nconvention for acting on the Constitution sat in this city, and the\r\nresult of its deliberations was doubtful, the mechanics assembled at the\r\nGreen Dragon tavern, and passed the most firm and spirited resolutions\r\nin favor of the Constitution; and when these resolutions were presented\r\nto the Boston delegation, by a committee of which Colonel Revere was\r\nchairman, they were asked by one of the members, how many mechanics were\r\nat the meeting; to which Colonel Revere answered, \"More than there are\r\nstars in heaven.\" With statesmanlike sagacity, they foresaw the\r\nadvantages of a united government. They celebrated, therefore, the\r\nadoption of the Constitution by rejoicings and festivals, such, perhaps,\r\nas have not since been witnessed. Emblematic representations, long\r\nprocessions of all the trades, and whatever else might contribute to the\r\njoyous demonstration of gratified patriotism, distinguished the\r\noccasion. Gentlemen, I can say with great truth, that an occasion\r\nintended to manifest respect to me could have originated nowhere with\r\nmore satisfaction to myself than with the mechanics of Boston.\r\n\r\nI am bound to make my acknowledgments to other classes of citizens who\r\nassemble here to join with the mechanics in the purpose of this meeting.\r\nI see with pleasure the successors and followers of the Mathers, of\r\nClarke, and of Cooper; and I am gratified, also, by the presence of\r\nthose of my own profession, in whose immediate presence and society so\r\ngreat a portion of my life has been passed. It is natural that I should\r\nvalue highly this proof of their regard. We have walked the same paths,\r\nwe have listened to the same oracles, we have been guided together by\r\nthe lights of Dana, and Parsons, and Sewall, and Parker, not to mention\r\nliving names, not unknown or unhonored either at home or abroad. As I\r\nhonor the profession, so I honor and respect its worthy members, as\r\ndefenders of truth, as supporters of law and liberty, as men who ever\r\nact on steady principles of honor and justice, and from whom no one,\r\nwith a right cause, is turned away, though he may come clothed in rags.\r\n\r\nMingling in this vast assembly, I perceive, Gentlemen, many citizens who\r\nbear an appellation which is honored, and which deserves to be honored,\r\nwherever a spirit of enlightened liberality, humanity, and charity finds\r\nregard and approbation among men, I mean the appellation of Boston\r\nmerchants. In a succession of generations, they have contributed\r\nuniformly to great objects of public interest and advantage. They have\r\nfounded institutions of learning, of piety, and of charity. They have\r\nexplored the field of human misfortune and calamity; they have sought\r\nout the causes of vice, and want, and ignorance, and have sought them\r\nonly that they might be removed and extirpated. They have poured out\r\nlike water the wealth acquired by their industry and honorable\r\nenterprise, to relieve the necessities of poverty, administer comfort to\r\nthe wretched, soothe the ravings of distressed insanity, open the eyes\r\nof the blind, unstop the ears of the deaf, and shed the light of\r\nknowledge, and the reforming influences of religion where ignorance and\r\ncrime have abounded. How am I to commend, not only single acts of\r\nbenevolence, but whole lives of benevolence, such as this? May He reward\r\nthem,--may that Almighty Being reward them, in whose irreversible\r\njudgment, in that day which is to come, the merit even of the widow's\r\nmite shall outweigh the advantages of all the pomp and grandeur of the\r\nworld!\r\n\r\nGentlemen, citizens of Boston, I have been in the midst of you for\r\ntwenty years. It is nearly sixteen years since, quite unexpectedly to\r\nmyself, you saw fit to require public service at my hands and to place\r\nme in the national legislature. If, in that long period, you have found\r\nin my public conduct something to be approved, and more to be forgiven\r\nthan to be reprehended, and if we meet here to-day better friends for so\r\nmany years of acquaintance and mutual confidence, I may well esteem\r\nmyself happy in the enjoyment of a high reward.\r\n\r\nI offer you again, fellow-citizens, my grateful acknowledgments, and\r\nall my sincere and cordial good wishes; and I propose to you as a\r\ntoast:--\r\n\r\n\"The City of Boston: May it continue to be the head-quarters of good\r\nprinciples, till the blood of the Revolutionary patriots shall have run\r\nthrough a thousand generations!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n  [113] Speech delivered at a Public Dinner in Faneuil Hall, given by the\r\n        Citizens of Boston to Mr. Webster, at the Close of the Session\r\n        of Congress, on the 24th of July, 1838.\r\n\r\n  [114] An extra session of Congress had been called by President Van\r\n        Buren, in September, 1837, in consequence of the general\r\n        suspension of specie payments by the banks.\r\n\r\n  [115] Hon. John Davis.\r\n\r\n  [116] See the Speech above, page 383.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.[117]\r\n\r\n  In the spring of 1839, Mr. Webster went for a short time to England.\r\n  He went in no public capacity, but his reputation had preceded him,\r\n  and he was received with every mark of the most distinguished\r\n  consideration. He was present at several public festivals, and his\r\n  addresses appear to have made a deep impression on those who heard\r\n  them. The following is the only one, however, which was reported at\r\n  any length. It was delivered at the first Triennial Celebration of\r\n  the Royal Agricultural Society, held at Oxford, on the 18th of July.\r\n  Three thousand persons were at table. Earl Spencer presided, and, in\r\n  introducing Mr. Webster, said they had \"already drunk the health of\r\n  a foreign minister who was present, but they had the honor and\r\n  advantage of having among them other foreigners, not employed in any\r\n  public capacity, who had come among them for the purpose of seeing a\r\n  meeting of English farmers, such as he believed never had been\r\n  witnessed before, but which he hoped might often be seen again.\r\n  Among these foreigners was one gentleman, of a most distinguished\r\n  character, from the United States of America, that great country,\r\n  whose people we were obliged legally to call foreigners, but who\r\n  were still our brethren in blood. It was most gratifying to him that\r\n  such a man was present at that meeting, that he might know what the\r\n  farmers of England really were, and be able to report to his\r\n  fellow-citizens the manner in which they were united, from every\r\n  class, in promoting their peaceful and most important objects.\" He\r\n  gave,--\r\n\r\n  \"The health of Mr. Webster, and other distinguished strangers.\"\r\n\r\n  The toast was received with much applause.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. WEBSTER said the notice which the noble Earl at the head of the\r\ntable had been kind enough to take of him, and the friendly sentiments\r\nwhich he had seen fit to express towards the country to which he\r\nbelonged, demanded his most cordial acknowledgments. He should therefore\r\nbegin by saying how much he was gratified in having it in his power to\r\npass one day among the proprietors, the cultivators, the farmers, of Old\r\nEngland; that England of which he had been reading and conversing all\r\nhis life, and now for once had the pleasure of visiting.\r\n\r\nI would say, in the next place, continued Mr. Webster, if I could say,\r\nhow much I have been pleased and gratified with one portion of the\r\nexhibition for which we are indebted to the formation of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society, and that is, the assemblage of so large a number\r\nof the farmers of England. When persons connected with some pursuit, of\r\nwhatever description, assemble in such numbers, I cannot look on them\r\nbut with respect and regard; but I freely confess that I am more than\r\nordinarily moved on all such occasions, when I see before me, on either\r\ncontinent, a great assemblage of those whose interests, whose hopes,\r\nwhose objects and pursuits in life, are connected with the cultivation\r\nof the soil.\r\n\r\nWhatever else may tend to enrich and beautify society, that which feeds\r\nand clothes comfortably the great mass of mankind should always be\r\nregarded as the great foundation of national prosperity. I need not say\r\nthat the agriculture of England is instructive to all the world; as a\r\nscience, it is here better understood; as an art, it is here better\r\npractised; as a great interest, it is here as highly esteemed as in any\r\nother part of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe importance of agriculture to a nation is obvious to every man; but\r\nit, perhaps, does not strike every mind so suddenly, although certainly\r\nit is equally true, that the annual produce of English agriculture is a\r\ngreat concern to the whole civilized world. The civilized and commercial\r\nstates are so connected, their interests are so blended, that it is a\r\nmatter of notoriety, that the fear or the prospect of a short crop in\r\nEngland deranges and agitates the business transactions and commercial\r\nspeculations of the whole trading world.\r\n\r\nIt is natural that this should be the case in those nations which look\r\nto the occurrence of a short crop in England as an occasion which may\r\nenable them to dispose profitably of their own surplus produce. But the\r\nfact goes much farther, for when such an event occurs in the English\r\ncapital,--the centre of commercial speculations, where the price of\r\ncommodities is settled and arranged for the whole world, where the\r\nexchanges between nations are conducted and concluded,--its consequences\r\nare felt everywhere, as no one knows better than the noble Earl who\r\noccupies the chair. Should there be a frost in England fifteen days\r\nlater than usual in the spring, should there be an unseasonable drought,\r\nor ten cold and wet days, instead of ten warm and dry ones, when the\r\nharvest is reaped, every exchange in Europe and America is more or less\r\naffected by the result.\r\n\r\nI will not pursue these remarks. [Loud cries of \"Go on! Go on!\"] I must,\r\nhowever, say, that I entertain not the slightest doubt of the great\r\nadvantage to the interest of agriculture which must result from the\r\nformation and operation of this society. Is it not obvious to the most\r\ncommon observer, that those who cultivate the soil have not the same\r\nconveniences, opportunities, and facilities of daily intercourse and\r\ncomparison of opinions, as the commercial and manufacturing interests?\r\nThose who are associated in the pursuits of commerce and manufactures\r\nnaturally congregate together in cities; they have immediate means of\r\nfrequent communication. Their sympathies, feelings, and opinions are\r\ninstantaneously circulated, like electricity, through the whole body.\r\n\r\nBut how is it with the cultivators of the soil? Separated, spread\r\nover a thousand fields, each attentive to his own acres, they have\r\nonly occasional opportunities of communicating with each other. If\r\namong commercial men chambers of commerce, and other institutions of\r\nthat character,--if among the trades guilds are found expedient, how\r\nmuch more necessary and advisable to have some such institutions as\r\nthis society, which, at least annually, shall bring together the\r\nrepresentatives of the great agricultural interest!\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the country to which I belong, there are societies\r\nupon a similar principle, which have been found very advantageous.\r\nAs with you, they offer rewards for specimens of fine animals, and for\r\nimplements of husbandry supposed to excel those which have been known\r\nbefore. They turn their attention to every thing designed to facilitate\r\nthe operations of the farmer, and improve his stock, and interest in the\r\ncountry. Among other means of improving agriculture, they have\r\nimported largely from the best breeds of animals known in England. I am\r\nsure that a gentleman who has to-day deservedly obtained many prizes\r\nfor stock will not be displeased to learn that I have seen, along the\r\nrich pastures of the Ohio and its tributary streams, animals raised\r\nfrom those which had been furnished by his farms in Yorkshire and\r\nNorthumberland.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from this subject, I beg leave to make a short response to\r\nthe very kind sentiments, which went near to my heart, as uttered by the\r\nnoble Earl at the head of the table.\r\n\r\nThe noble chairman was pleased to speak of the people of the United\r\nStates as kindred in blood with the people of England. I am an American.\r\nI was born on that great continent and I am wedded to the fortunes of my\r\ncountry, for weal or for woe. There is no other region of the earth\r\nwhich I can call my country. But I know, and I am proud to know, what\r\nblood flows in these veins.\r\n\r\nI am happy to stand here to-day, and to remember, that, although my\r\nancestors, for several generations, lie buried beneath the soil of the\r\nwestern continent, yet there has been a time when my ancestors and your\r\nancestors toiled in the same cities and villages, cultivated adjacent\r\nfields, and worked together to build up that great structure of civil\r\npolity which has made England what England is.\r\n\r\nWhen I was about to embark for this country, some friends asked me what\r\nI was going to England for. To be sure, Gentlemen, I came for no object\r\nof business, public or private; but I told them I was coming to see the\r\nelder branch of the family. I told them I was coming to see my distant\r\nrelations, my kith and kin of the old Saxon race.\r\n\r\nWith regard to whatsoever is important to the peace of the world, its\r\nprosperity, the progress of knowledge and of just opinions, the\r\ndiffusion of the sacred light of Christianity, I know nothing more\r\nimportant to the promotion of those best interests of humanity, and the\r\ncause of the general peace, amity, and concord, than the good feeling\r\nsubsisting between the Englishmen on this side of the Atlantic, and the\r\ndescendants of Englishmen on the other.\r\n\r\nSome little clouds have overhung our horizon,--I trust they will soon\r\npass away. I am sure that the age we live in does not expect that\r\nEngland and America are to have controversies carried to the extreme,\r\nupon any occasion not of the last importance to national interests and\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\nWe live in an age when nations, as well as individuals, are subject to a\r\nmoral responsibility. Neither governments nor people--thank God for\r\nit!--can now trifle with the general sense of the civilized world; and I\r\nam sure that the civilized world would hold your country and my country\r\nto a very strict account, if, without very plain and apparent reason,\r\ndeeply affecting the independence and great interests of the nation, any\r\ncontroversy between them should have other than an amicable issue.\r\n\r\nI will venture to say that each country has intelligence enough to\r\nunderstand all that belongs to its just rights, and is not deficient in\r\nmeans to maintain them; and if any controversy between England and\r\nAmerica were to be pushed to the extreme of force, neither party would\r\nor could have any signal advantage over the other, except what it could\r\nfind in the justice of its cause and the approbation of the world.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the occasion which has called us together, I beg to\r\nrepeat the gratification which I have felt in passing a day in such a\r\ncompany, and to conclude with the most fervent expression of my wish for\r\nthe prosperity and usefulness of the Agricultural Society of England.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n  [117] Address at the Triennial Celebration of the Royal Agricultural\r\n        Society of England, at Oxford on the 18th of July, 1839.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGRICULTURE OF ENGLAND.[118]\r\n\r\n  Mr. Webster has at all periods of life cherished a strong attachment\r\n  to agricultural pursuits. Of late years, when not obliged to be at\r\n  Washington, in the discharge of his public duties, he has resided\r\n  wholly on his farm at Marshfield, Massachusetts. The condition of\r\n  the agriculture of England was one of the objects which most\r\n  received his attention, during his short visit to that country in\r\n  1839. On his return to the United States in January, 1840, a strong\r\n  desire was entertained by his friends to meet him on some public\r\n  occasion, and a wish was expressed, particularly by many members of\r\n  the Legislature of Massachusetts, who were in the habit of holding\r\n  occasional meetings for the discussion of agricultural subjects, to\r\n  learn the result of his observations on the present state of English\r\n  agriculture. These wishes were communicated to Mr. Webster, and an\r\n  early day was appointed for a meeting, at which the following\r\n  remarks were made by him.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN, I would observe in the outset of these remarks, that I\r\nregard agriculture as the leading interest of society; and as having, in\r\nall its relations, a direct and intimate bearing upon human comfort and\r\nthe national prosperity. I have been familiar with its operations in my\r\nyouth; and I have always looked upon the subject with a lively and deep\r\ninterest. I do not esteem myself to be particularly qualified to judge\r\nof the subject in all its various aspects and departments; and I neither\r\nmyself regard, nor would I have others regard, my opinions as\r\nauthoritative. But the subject has been one of careful observation to\r\nme, both in public and private life; and my visit to Europe, at a season\r\nof the year particularly favorable for this purpose, has given me the\r\nopportunity of seeing its improved husbandry, and as far as it may be\r\ninteresting, or can have a bearing upon the subject of the evening's\r\ndiscussion, the agriculture of Massachusetts, I will, as the meeting\r\nappear to expect, say a few words upon what has attracted my notice.\r\n\r\nHow far, in a question of this kind, the example of other countries is\r\nto be followed, is an inquiry worthy of much consideration. The example\r\nof a foreign country may be too closely followed. It will furnish a safe\r\nrule of imitation only as far as the circumstances of the one country\r\ncorrespond with those of the other.\r\n\r\nThe great objects of agriculture, and the great agricultural products of\r\nEngland and of Massachusetts, are much the same. Neither country\r\nproduces olives, nor rice, nor cotton, nor the sugar-cane. Bread, meat,\r\nand clothing are the main productions of both. But, although the great\r\nproductions are mainly the same, there are many diversities of condition\r\nand circumstances, and various modes of culture.\r\n\r\nThe primary elements which enter into the consideration of the\r\nagriculture of a country are four,--climate, soil, price of land, and\r\nprice of labor. In any comparison, therefore, of the agriculture of\r\nEngland with that of Massachusetts, these elements are to be taken\r\nparticularly into view.\r\n\r\nThe climate of England differs essentially from that of this country.\r\nEngland is on the western side of the eastern, and we on the eastern\r\nside of the western continent. The climate of all countries is\r\nmaterially affected by their respective situations in relation to the\r\nocean. The winds which prevail most, both in this country and in\r\nEngland, are from the west. It is known that the wind blows, in our\r\nlatitude, from some point west to some point east, on an average of\r\nyears, nearly or quite three days out of four. These facts are familiar.\r\nThe consequences resulting from them are, that our winters are colder\r\nand our summers much hotter than in England. Our latitude is about that\r\nof Oporto, yet the temperature is very different. On these accounts,\r\ntherefore, the maturing of the crops in England, and the power of using\r\nthese crops, creates a material difference between its agriculture and\r\nours. It may be supposed that our climate must resemble that of China in\r\nthe same latitudes; and this fact may have an essential bearing upon\r\nthat branch of agriculture which it is proposed to introduce among us,\r\nthe production of silk.\r\n\r\nThe second point of difference between the two countries lies in the\r\nsoil. The soil of England is mainly argillaceous, a soft and unctuous\r\nloam upon a substratum of clay. This may be considered as the\r\npredominant characteristic in the parts which I visited. The soil in\r\nsome of the southern counties of England is thinner; some of it is what\r\nwe should call stony; much of it is a free, gravelly soil, with some\r\nsmall part which, with us, would be called sandy. Through a great extent\r\nof country, this soil rests on a deep bed of chalk. Ours is a granite\r\nsoil. There is granite in Great Britain; but this species of soil\r\nprevails in Scotland, a part of the country which more resembles our\r\nown. We may have some lands as good as any in England. Our alluvial\r\nsoils on Connecticut River, and in some other parts of the country, are\r\nequal to any lands; but these have not, ordinarily, a wide extent of\r\nclay subsoil. The soil of Massachusetts is harder, more granitic, less\r\nabounding in clay, and altogether more stony, than the soil of England.\r\nThe surface of Massachusetts is more uneven, more broken with mountain\r\nridges, more diversified with hill and dale, and more abundant in\r\nstreams of water, than that of England.\r\n\r\nThe price of land in that county, another important element in\r\nagricultural calculations, differs greatly from the price of land with\r\nus. It is three times as high as in Massachusetts, at least.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the price of agricultural labor is much higher in\r\nMassachusetts than in England. The price of labor varies considerably in\r\ndifferent parts of England; but it may be set down as twice as dear with\r\nus here.\r\n\r\nThese are the general remarks which have suggested themselves to me in\r\nregard to the state of things abroad. Now, have we any thing to learn\r\nfrom them? Is there any thing in the condition of England applicable to\r\nus, or in regard to which the agriculture of England may be of use to\r\nMassachusetts and other countries?\r\n\r\nThe subject of agriculture, in England, has strongly attracted the\r\nattention and inquiries of men of science. They have studied\r\nparticularly the nature of the soil. More than twenty years ago, Sir\r\nHumphrey Davy undertook to treat the subject of the application of\r\nchemical knowledge to agriculture in the analysis of soils and manures.\r\nThe same attention has been continued to the subject; and the\r\nextraordinary discoveries and advances in chemical science, since his\r\ntime, are likely to operate greatly to the advantage of agriculture. The\r\nbest results may be expected from them. These inquiries are now\r\nprosecuted in France with great enthusiasm and success. We may hope for\r\nlike beneficial results here from the application of science to the same\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nBut although the circumstances of climate and situation, and nature of\r\nthe soil, form permanent distinctions which cannot be changed, yet there\r\nare other differences, resulting from different modes of culture, and\r\ndifferent forms of applying labor; and it is to these differences that\r\nour attention should be particularly directed. Here, there is much to\r\nlearn. English cultivation is more scientific, more systematic, and more\r\nexact, a great deal, than ours. This is partly the result of necessity.\r\nA vast population is to be supported on comparatively a small surface.\r\nLands are dear, rents are high, and hands, as well as mouths, are\r\nnumerous. Careful and skillful cultivation is the natural result of this\r\nstate of things. An English farmer looks not merely to the present\r\nyear's crop. He considers what will be the condition of the land when\r\nthat crop is off; and what it will be fit for the next year. He studies\r\nto use his land so as not to abuse it. On the contrary, his aim is to\r\nget crop after crop, while still the land shall be growing better and\r\nbetter. If he should content himself with raising from the soil a large\r\ncrop this year, and then leave it neglected and exhausted, he would\r\nstarve. It is upon this fundamental idea of constant production without\r\nexhaustion, that the system of English cultivation, and, indeed, of all\r\ngood cultivation, is founded. England is not original in this. Flanders,\r\nand perhaps Italy, have been her teachers. This system is carried out in\r\npractice by a well-considered rotation of crops. The form or manner of\r\nthis rotation, in a given case, is determined very much by the value of\r\nthe soil, and partly by the local demand for particular products. But\r\nsome rotation, some succession, some variation in the annual productions\r\nof the same land, is essential. No tenant could obtain a lease, or, if\r\nhe should, could pay his rent and maintain his family, who should wholly\r\ndisregard this. White crops (wheat, barley, rye, oats, &c.) are not to\r\nfollow one another. Our maize, or Indian corn, must be considered a\r\nwhite crop; although, from the quantity of stalk and leaf which it\r\nproduces, and which are such excellent food for cattle, it is less\r\nexhausting than some other white crops; or, to speak more properly, it\r\nmakes greater returns to the land. The cultivation of maize has not,\r\nhowever, been carried to any extent in England. Green crops are turnips,\r\npotatoes, beets, vetches, or tares (which are usually eaten while\r\ngrowing, by cattle and sheep, or cut for green food), and clover. Buck\r\nor beech wheat, and winter oats,--thought to be a very useful\r\nproduct,--are regarded also as green crops, when eaten on the land; and\r\nso, indeed, may any crop be considered, which is used in this way. But\r\nthe turnip is the great green crop of England. Its cultivation has\r\nwrought such changes, in fifty years, that it may be said to have\r\nrevolutionized English agriculture.\r\n\r\nBefore that time, when lands became exhausted by the repetition of\r\ngrain crops, they were left, as it was termed, fallow; that is, were\r\nnot cultivated at all, but left to recruit themselves as they might.\r\nThis occurred as often as every fourth year, so that one quarter of\r\nthe arable land was always out of cultivation, and yielded nothing.\r\nTurnips are now substituted in the place of these naked fallows; and\r\nnow land in turnips is considered as fallow. What is the philosophy of\r\nthis? The raising of crops, even of any, the most favorable crop, does\r\nnot, in itself, enrich, but in some degree exhausts, the land. The\r\nexhaustion of the land, however, as experience and observation have\r\nfully demonstrated, takes place mainly when the seeds of a plant are\r\nallowed to perfect themselves. The turnip is a biennial plant. It\r\ndoes not perfect its seed before it is consumed.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance in respect to the turnip plant which\r\ndeserves consideration. Plants, it is well understood, derive a large\r\nportion of their nutriment from the air. The leaves of plants are their\r\nlungs. The leaves of turnips expose a wide surface to the atmosphere,\r\nand derive, therefore, much of their subsistence and nutriment from\r\nthese sources. The broad leaves of the turnips likewise shade the\r\nground, preserve its moisture, and prevent, in some measure, its\r\nexhaustion by the sun and air.\r\n\r\nThe turnips have a further and ultimate use. Meat and clothing come from\r\nanimals. The more animals are sustained upon a farm, the more meat and\r\nthe more clothing. These things bear, of course, a proportion to the\r\nnumber of bullocks, sheep, swine, and poultry which are maintained. The\r\ngreat inquiry, then, is, What kind of crops will least exhaust the land\r\nin their cultivation, and furnish, at the same time, support to the\r\nlargest number of animals?\r\n\r\nA very large amount of land, in England, is cultivated in turnips.\r\nFields of turnips of three, four, and even five hundred acres, are\r\nsometimes seen, though the common fields are much less; and it may be\r\nobserved here, that, in the richest and best cultivated parts of\r\nEngland, enclosures of ten, fifteen, twenty, or thirty acres seemed more\r\ncommon. Since the introduction of the turnip culture, bullocks and sheep\r\nhave trebled in number. Turnips, for the reasons given, are not great\r\nexhausters of the soil; and they furnish abundant food for animals. Let\r\nus suppose that one bushel of oats or barley may be raised at the same\r\ncost as ten bushels of turnips, and will go as far in support of stock.\r\nThe great difference in the two crops is to be found in the farmer's\r\nbarn-yard. Here is the test of their comparative value. This is the\r\nsecret of the great advantages which follow from their cultivation. The\r\nvalue of manure in agriculture is well appreciated. M'Queen states the\r\nextraordinary fact, that the value of the animal manure annually applied\r\nto the crops in England, at current prices, surpasses in value the whole\r\namount of its foreign commerce. There is no doubt that it greatly\r\nexceeds it. The turnip crop returns a vast amount of nutritive matter to\r\nthe soil. The farmer, then, from his green crops, and by a regular\r\nsystem of rotation, finds green fodder for his cattle and wheat for the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nAmong the lighter English soils is that of the county of Norfolk, a\r\ncounty, however, which I had not the pleasure of visiting. Its soil, I\r\nunderstand, is light, a little inclined to sand, or light loam. Such\r\nsoils are not unfavorable to roots. Here is the place of the remarkable\r\ncultivation and distinguished improvements of that eminent cultivator,\r\nMr. Coke, now Earl of Leicester. In these lands, as I was told, a common\r\nrotation is turnips, barley, clover, wheat. These lands resemble much of\r\nthe land in our county of Plymouth, and the sandy lands to be found in\r\nthe vicinity of the Connecticut and Merrimack Rivers. The cultivation of\r\ngreen crops in New England deserves attention. There is no incapacity in\r\nour soil, and there are no circumstances unfavorable to their\r\nproduction. What would be the best kind of succulent vegetables to be\r\ncultivated, whether turnips or carrots, I am not prepared to say. But\r\nno attempts, within my knowledge, have been made among us of a\r\nsystematic agriculture; and until we enter upon some regular rotation of\r\ncrops, and our husbandry becomes more systematic, no distinguished\r\nsuccess can be looked for. As to our soil, as has been remarked, there\r\nis no inherent incapacity for the production of any of the common crops.\r\nWe can raise wheat in Massachusetts. The average crop in England is\r\ntwenty-six bushels to the acre. From my own farm, where the soil is\r\ncomparatively thin and poor, I have obtained this summer seventy-six\r\nbushels of wheat upon three acres of land. It is not, therefore, any\r\nwant of capability in the soil; but the improvement and success of our\r\nhusbandry must depend upon a succession of crops adapted to the\r\ncircumstances of our soil, climate, and peculiar condition.\r\n\r\nIn England, a large portion of the turnip crop is consumed on the land\r\nwhere it grows. The sheep are fed out of doors all winter; and I saw\r\nmany large flocks, in the aggregate thousands and even millions of\r\nsheep, which were never housed. This was matter of surprise, especially\r\nconsidering the wetness of the climate; and these sheep are often\r\nexposed in fields where a dry spot cannot be found for them to lie down\r\nupon. Sheep are often folded in England by wattled fences, or hurdles\r\ntemporarily erected in different parts of the field, and removed from\r\nplace to place, as the portions of the crop thus fenced off are\r\nconsumed. In some cases they are folded, and the turnips dug and carried\r\nto them. In such cases, they are always fed upon lands which are\r\nintended the next year to be, as far as practicable, brought under\r\ncultivation. I have seen many laborers in fields, employed in drawing\r\nthe turnips, splitting them, and scattering them over the land, for the\r\nuse of the sheep, which is considered better, often, than to leave the\r\nsheep to dig for themselves. These laborers are so employed all winter,\r\nand if the ground should become frozen, the turnips are taken up with a\r\nbar. Together with the turnips, it is thought important that sheep\r\nshould have a small quantity of other food. Chopped hay, sometimes a\r\nlittle oil-cake, or oats, is usually given. This is called _trough_\r\nfood, as it is eaten in troughs, standing about in the field. In so\r\nmoist a climate as that of England, some land is so wet that, in the\r\nfarmer's phrase, it will not _carry sheep_; that is, it is quite too\r\nwet for sheep to lie out upon it. In such cases, the turnips must be\r\n_carried_, that is, removed from the field, and fed out elsewhere. The\r\nlast season was uncommonly wet, and for that reason, perhaps, I could\r\nnot so well judge; but it appeared to me that it would be an improvement\r\nin English husbandry, to furnish for sheep, oftener than is done, not\r\nonly a tolerably dry ground to lie on, but some sort of shelter against\r\nthe cold rains of winter. The turnips, doubtless, are more completely\r\nconsumed, when dug, split, and fed out. The Swedish turnip, I have\r\nlittle doubt, is best suited to cold climates. It is scarcely injured by\r\nbeing frozen in the ground in the winter, as it will thaw again, and be\r\nstill good, in spring. In Scotland, in the Lothians, where cultivation\r\nis equal to that in any part of England, it is more the practice than\r\nfarther south to house turnips, or draw them, and cover them from frost.\r\nI have been greatly pleased with Scotch farming, and as the climate and\r\nsoil of Scotland more resemble the soil and climate of Massachusetts\r\nthan those of England do, I hope the farmers of Massachusetts will\r\nacquaint themselves, as well as they can, with Scotch husbandry. I had\r\nthe pleasure of passing some time in Scotland, with persons engaged in\r\nthese pursuits, and acknowledge myself much instructed by what I learned\r\nfrom them, and saw in their company. The great extent of the use of\r\nturnips and other green crops in Scotland is evidence that such crops\r\ncannot be altogether unsuited to Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nAmong the subjects which of late years have engaged much of the\r\nattention of agriculturists in England, few are more important than that\r\nof tile draining. This most efficient and successful mode of draining\r\nis getting into very extensive use. Much of the soil of England, as\r\nI have already stated, rests on a clayey and retentive subsoil.\r\nExcessive wetness is prejudicial and destructive to the crops.\r\nMarginal drains, or drains on the outside of the fields, do not\r\nproduce the desired results. These tile-drains have effected most\r\nimportant improvements. The tile itself is made of clay, baked like\r\nbricks; it is about one foot in length, four inches in width, three\r\nfourths of an inch in thickness, and it stands from six to eight\r\ninches in height, being hemispherical, or like the half of a cylinder,\r\nwith its sides elongated. It somewhat resembles the Dutch tiles which\r\nare seen on the roofs of the old houses in Albany and New York. A\r\nditch is sunk, eighteen or twenty inches in depth, and these drains\r\nare multiplied over a field, sometimes at a distance of only seven\r\nyards apart. The ditch or drain being dug, these tiles are laid down,\r\nwith the hollow side at bottom, on the smooth clay, or any other firm\r\nsubsoil, the sides placed near to each other, some little straw thrown\r\nover the joints to prevent the admission of dirt, and the whole covered\r\nup. This is not so expensive a mode of draining as might be supposed.\r\nThe ditch or drain need only be narrow, and tiles are of much cheaper\r\ntransportation than stone would be. But the result is so important as\r\nwell to justify the expense. It is estimated that this thorough\r\ndraining adds often twenty per cent. to the production of the wheat\r\ncrop. A beautiful example came under my observation in Nottinghamshire,\r\nnot long before I left England. A gentleman was showing me his grounds\r\nfor next year's crop of wheat. On one side of the lane, where the land\r\nhad been drained, the wheat was already up and growing luxuriantly; on\r\nthe other, where the land was subject to no other disadvantage than\r\nthat it had not been drained, it was still too wet to be sowed at\r\nall. It may be thought singular enough, but it is doubtless true, that,\r\non stiff, clayey lands, thorough draining is as useful in dry, hot\r\nsummers as in cold and wet summers; for such land, if a wet winter\r\nor spring be suddenly followed by hot and dry weather, is apt to become\r\nhard and baked, so that the roots of plants cannot enter it. Thorough\r\ndraining, by giving an opportunity to the water on the surface to be\r\nconstantly escaping, corrects this evil. Draining can never be\r\nneeded to so great an extent in Massachusetts as in England and\r\nScotland, from the different nature of the soil; but we have yet\r\nquantities of low meadow lands, producing wild, harsh, sour grasses,\r\nor producing nothing, which, there is little doubt, might be rendered\r\nmost profitable hay-fields, by being well drained. When we understand\r\nbetter the importance of concentrating labor, instead of scattering\r\nit,--when we shall come to estimate duly the superior profit of \"a\r\nlittle farm, well tilled,\" over a great farm, half cultivated and half\r\nmanured, overrun with weeds, and scourged with exhausting crops,--we\r\nshall then fill our barns, and double the winter fodder for our cattle\r\nand sheep by the products of these waste meadows.\r\n\r\nThere is in England another mode of improvement, most important,\r\ninstances of which I have seen, and one of which I regard as the most\r\nbeautiful agricultural improvement which has ever come under my\r\nobservation. I mean irrigation, or the making of what are called _water\r\nmeadows_. I first saw them in Wiltshire, and was much struck with them,\r\nnot having before understood, from reading or conversation, exactly what\r\nthey were. But I afterwards had an opportunity of examining a most\r\nsignal and successful example of this mode of improvement, on the\r\nestates of the Duke of Portland, in the North of England, on the borders\r\nof Sherwood forest. Indeed, it was part of the old forest known by that\r\nname. Sherwood forest, at least in its present state, is not like the\r\npine forests of Maine, the heavy, hard wood forests of the unredeemed\r\nlands of New Hampshire and Vermont, or the still heavier timbered lands\r\nof the West. It embraces a large extent of country, with various soils,\r\nsome of them thin and light, with beautiful and venerable oaks, of\r\nunknown age, much open ground between them and underneath their\r\nwide-spread branches, and this covered with heather, lichens, and fern.\r\nSherwood forest, indeed, is not less interesting for the natural beauty\r\nwhich charms the eye, than for its venerable antiquity and historical\r\nassociations. But in many parts the soil is far enough from being rich.\r\nUpon the borders of this forest are the water meadows of which I am\r\nspeaking. A little river runs through the forest in this part, at the\r\nbottom of a valley with sides moderately sloping, and of considerable\r\nextent, between the river at the bottom and the common level of the\r\nsurrounding country above. This little river, before reaching the place,\r\nruns through a small town, and gathers, doubtless, some refuse matter in\r\nits course. From this river, the water is taken at the upper end of the\r\nvalley, conducted along the edge, or bank, in a canal or carrier, and\r\nfrom this carrier, at proper times, suffered to flow out very gently,\r\nspreading over and irrigating the whole surface, trickling and shining,\r\nwhen I saw it, (and it was then November,) among the light-green of the\r\nnew-springing grass, and collected below in another canal, from which it\r\nis again let out, to flow in like manner over land lying still farther\r\ndown towards the bottom of the valley. Ten years ago, this land, for\r\nproduction, was worth little or nothing. I was told that some of it had\r\nbeen let, for no more than a shilling an acre. It has not been manured,\r\nand yet is now most extensively productive. It is not flooded; the water\r\ndoes not stand upon it; it flows gently over, and is applied several\r\ntimes in a year to each part, say in March, May, July, and October. In\r\nNovember, when I saw it, the farmers were taking off the third crop of\r\nhay cut this season, and that crop was certainly not less than two tons\r\nto the acre. This last crop is mostly used as green food for cattle.\r\nWhen I speak of the number of tons, I mean tons of dried hay. After this\r\ncrop was off, sheep were to be put on it, to have lambs at Christmas, so\r\nas to come into market in March, a time of year when they command a high\r\nprice. Upon taking off the sheep in March, the land would be watered.\r\nThe process of watering lasts two or three days, or perhaps eight or ten\r\ndays, according to circumstances, and is repeated after the taking off\r\nof each successive crop. Although this water has no doubt considerable\r\nsediment in it, yet the general fact shows how important water itself is\r\nto the growth of plants, and how far, even, it may supply the place of\r\nother sources of sustenance. Now we in Massachusetts have a more uneven\r\nsurface, more valleys with sloping sides, by many times more streams,\r\nand such a climate that our farms suffer much oftener from drought than\r\nfarms in England. May we not learn something useful, therefore, from\r\nsuch examples of irrigation in that country?\r\n\r\nWith respect to implements of husbandry, I am of opinion that the\r\nEnglish, upon the whole, have no advantage over us. Their wagons and\r\ncarts are no better; their ploughs, I thought, not better anywhere, and\r\nin some counties far inferior, because unnecessarily heavy. The subsoil\r\nplough, for which we have little use, is esteemed a useful invention,\r\nand the mole plough, which I have seen in operation, and the use of\r\nwhich is to make an underground drain, without disturbing the surface,\r\nis an ingenious contrivance, likely to be useful in clay soils, free\r\nfrom stone and gravel, but which can be little used in Massachusetts. In\r\ngeneral, the English utensils of husbandry seemed to me unnecessarily\r\ncumbrous and heavy. The ploughs, especially, require a great strength of\r\ndraught. But as drill husbandry is extensively practised in England, and\r\nvery little with us, the various implements, or machines, for\r\ndrill-sowing in that country quite surpass all we have. I do not\r\nremember to have seen the horse-rake used in England, although I saw in\r\noperation implements for spreading hay from the swath to dry, or rather,\r\nperhaps, for turning it, drawn by horses.\r\n\r\nThere are other matters connected with English agriculture, upon which I\r\nmight say a word or two. Crops are cultivated in England, of which we\r\nknow little. The common English field bean, a small brown bean, growing\r\nnot on a clinging vine, like some varieties of the taller bean, runs in\r\nwhat is called with us the bush form, like our common white bean, upon a\r\nslight, upright stalk, two or two and a half feet high, and producing\r\nfrom twenty to forty bushels to the acre. It is valuable as food for\r\nanimals, especially for horses. This bean does not grow well in thin\r\nsoils, or what is called a hot bottom. A strong, stiff, clayey land,\r\nwell manured, suits it best. Vetches, or tares, a sort of pea, are very\r\nmuch cultivated in England, although almost unknown here, and are there\r\neither eaten green, by sheep, on the land, or cut and carried for green\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe raising of sheep in England is an immense interest. England probably\r\nclips fifty millions of fleeces this year, lambs under a year old not\r\nbeing shorn. The average yield may be six or seven pounds to a fleece.\r\nThere are two principal classes of sheep in England, the long-wooled and\r\nthe short-wooled. Among these are many varieties, but this is the\r\ngeneral division or classification. The Leicester and the South Down\r\nbelong, respectively, to these several families. The common clip of the\r\nformer may be estimated from seven to eight pounds; and of the last,\r\nfrom three to three and a half, or four. I mention these particulars\r\nonly as estimates; and much more accurate information may doubtless be\r\nobtained from many writers. In New England, we are just beginning to\r\nestimate rightly the importance of raising sheep. England has seen it\r\nmuch earlier, and is pursuing it with far more zeal and perseverance.\r\nOur climate, as already observed, differs from that of England; but the\r\ngreat inquiry, applicable in equal force to both countries, is, How can\r\nwe manage our land in order to produce the largest crops, while, at the\r\nsame time, we keep up the condition of the land, and place it, if\r\npossible, in a course of gradual improvement? The success of farming\r\nmust depend, in a considerable degree, upon the animals produced and\r\nsupported on the farm. The farmer may calculate, in respect to animals,\r\nupon two grounds of profit, the natural growth of the animal, and the\r\nweight obtained by fattening. The skilful farmer, therefore, expects,\r\nwhere he gains one pound in the fattening of his animal, to gain an\r\nequal amount in the growth. The early maturity of stock is consequently\r\na point of much importance.\r\n\r\nOxen are rarely reared in England for the yoke. In Devonshire and\r\nCornwall, ox teams are employed; but in travelling one thousand miles in\r\nEngland, I saw only one ox team, and in that case they were driven one\r\nbefore the other, and in harnesses similar to those of horses. Bullocks\r\nare raised for the market. It is highly desirable, therefore, both in\r\nrespect to neat cattle and sheep, that their growth should be rapid, and\r\ntheir fattening properties favorable, that they may be early disposed\r\nof, and the expense of production proportionably lessened.\r\n\r\nIs it practicable, on the soil and in the climate of Massachusetts, to\r\npursue a succession of crops? I cannot question it; and I have entire\r\nconfidence in the improvements to our husbandry, and the other great\r\nadvantages, which would accrue from judicious rotation of products. The\r\ncapacities of the soil of Massachusetts are undoubted. One hundred\r\nbushels of corn to an acre have been repeatedly produced, and other\r\ncrops in like abundance. But this will not effect the proper ends of a\r\njudicious and profitable agriculture, unless we can so manage our\r\nhusbandry that, by a judicious and proper succession of the crops, land\r\nwill not only be restored after an exhausting crop, but gradually\r\nenriched by cultivation. It is of the highest importance that our\r\nfarmers should increase their power of sustaining live stock, that they\r\nmay obtain in that way the means of improving their farms.\r\n\r\nThe breed of cattle in England is greatly improved, and still improving.\r\nI have seen some of the best stocks, and many individual animals from\r\nothers, and think them admirable. The short-horned cattle brought to\r\nthis country are often very good specimens. I have seen the flocks from\r\nwhich some of them have been selected, and they are certainly among the\r\nbest in England. But in every selection of stock, we are to regard our\r\nown climate, and our own circumstances. We raise oxen for work, as well\r\nas for beef; and I am of opinion that the Devonshire stock furnishes\r\nexcellent animals for our use We have suffered that old stock, brought\r\nhither by our ancestors, to run down, and be deteriorated. It has been\r\nkept up and greatly improved in England, and we may now usefully import\r\nfrom it. The Devonshire ox is a hardy animal, of size and make suited to\r\nthe plough, and though certainly not the largest for beef, yet generally\r\nvery well fattened. I think quite well, also, of the Ayrshire cows. They\r\nare good milkers, and, being a hardy race, are on that account well\r\nsuited to a cold climate and to the coarse and sometimes scanty\r\npasturage of New England. After all, I think there can be no doubt that\r\nthe improved breed of short horns are the finest cattle in the world,\r\nand should be preferred wherever plenty of good fodder and some mildness\r\nof climate invite them. They are well fitted to the Western States,\r\nwhere there is an overflowing abundance, both of winter and summer\r\nfodder, and where, as in England, bullocks are raised for beef only. I\r\nhave no doubt, also, that they might be advantageously raised in the\r\nrich valleys of the Connecticut, and perhaps in some other favored parts\r\nof the State. But for myself, as a farmer on the thin lands of Plymouth\r\nCounty, and on the bleak shores of the sea, I do not feel that I could\r\ngive to animals of this breed that entertainment which their merit\r\ndeserves.\r\n\r\nAs to sheep, the Leicesters are like the short-horned cattle. They must\r\nbe kept well; they should always be fat; and, pressed by good keeping to\r\nearly maturity, they are found very profitable. \"Feed well,\" was the\r\nmaxim of the great Roman farmer, Cato; and that short sentence comprises\r\nmuch of all that belongs to the profitable economy of live stock. The\r\nSouth Downs are a good breed, both for wool and mutton. They crop the\r\ngrass that grows on the thin soils, over beds of chalk, in Wiltshire,\r\nHampshire, and Dorsetshire. They ought not to scorn the pastures of New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn our thoughts to the condition of England, we must perceive\r\nof what immense importance is every, even the smallest, degree of\r\nimprovement in its agricultural productions. Suppose that, by some new\r\ndiscovery, or some improved mode of culture, only one per cent. could be\r\nadded to the annual results of English cultivation; this, of itself,\r\nwould materially affect the comfortable subsistence of millions of human\r\nbeings. It is often said that England is a garden. This is a strong\r\nmetaphor. There is poor land and some poor cultivation in England. All\r\npeople are not equally industrious, careful, and skillful. But, on the\r\nwhole, England is a prodigy of agricultural wealth. Flanders may\r\npossibly surpass it. I have not seen Flanders; but England quite\r\nsurpasses, in this respect, whatever I have seen. In associations for\r\nthe improvement of agriculture we have been earlier than England. But\r\nsuch associations now exist there. I had the pleasure of attending the\r\nfirst meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, and I found\r\nit a very pleasant and interesting occasion. Persons of the highest\r\ndistinction for rank, talents, and wealth were present, all zealously\r\nengaged in efforts for the promotion of the agricultural interest. No\r\nman in England is so high as to be independent of the success of this\r\ngreat interest; no man so low as not to be affected by its prosperity or\r\nits decline. The same is true, eminently and emphatically true, with us.\r\nAgriculture feeds us; to a great degree it clothes us; without it we\r\ncould not have manufactures, and we should not have commerce. These all\r\nstand together, but they stand together like pillars in a cluster, the\r\nlargest in the centre, and that largest is agriculture. Let us remember,\r\ntoo, that we live in a country of small farms and freehold tenements; a\r\ncountry in which men cultivate with their own hands their own fee-simple\r\nacres, drawing not only their subsistence, but also their spirit of\r\nindependence and manly freedom, from the ground they plough. They are at\r\nonce its owners, its cultivators, and its defenders. And, whatever else\r\nmay be undervalued or overlooked, let us never forget that the\r\ncultivation of the earth is the most important labor of man. Man may be\r\ncivilized, in some degree, without great progress in manufactures and\r\nwith little commerce with his distant neighbors. But without the\r\ncultivation of the earth, he is, in all countries, a savage. Until he\r\ngives up the chase, and fixes himself in some place and seeks a living\r\nfrom the earth, he is a roaming barbarian. When tillage begins, other\r\narts follow. The farmers, therefore, are the founders of human\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n  [118] Remarks on the Agriculture of England, made at a Meeting of the\r\n        Legislature of Massachusetts, and others interested in\r\n        Agriculture, held at the State-House in Boston, on the Evening\r\n        of the 13th of January, 1840.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nPassages in italics indicated by _underscores_.\r\n\r\nTypographical inconsistencies have been changed.\r\n\r\nThe following significant changes were made to the original text:\r\n\r\nPage 3: No footnote for marker (INTRODUCTORY NOTE.*)\r\n\r\nFootnote 99: Footnote marker missing\r\n\r\nFootnote 100: Footnote marker missing",
