After five hundred years Mohammed\r\nII seized upon Constantinople, and that city became the capital of the\r\nTurkish Empire;—for the next two hundred years the dominion spread\r\nuntil it became an immense and important world-power. Then began a\r\nperiod of decline; and vice and prodigality in harem and seraglio\r\nbrought about disruption and war. Russia saw her opportunity to extend\r\nher borders towards the sea—and went on gaining Turkish territory\r\nfrom early in the 18th until the middle of the 19th century when the\r\nCrimean war crippled her power in that corner of Europe. But Turkey\r\ncould not hold the heterogeneous populations of her European provinces.\r\nInsurrection after insurrection broke out and one by one she lost\r\nmany of the more important of them. She became bankrupt and a concert\r\nof the European Powers proposed and partially carried out a scheme\r\nfor her reform. But she proved stubborn and went to war with Russia\r\nin 1877-1878; this ended disastrously for her and more territory was\r\nlost. In 1897, came the war with Greece in which she was successful. In\r\nrecent years after many vicissitudes the spread of the great awakening\r\nof the people of Oriental lands has reached Turkey, and the story of\r\nthe newer political and social life in that country is related in this\r\nvolume in full and complete detail, from its inception until the famous\r\nRevolution of 1908.\r\n\r\nNo one is better qualified to tell this story than Edward F. Knight,\r\nwho as a noted correspondent for one of the leading papers of London\r\nhas seen service in all the wars since 1895, his work having taken\r\nhim to South America, Africa, and Asia. In 1908, he was specially\r\ncommissioned to visit Turkey to study the conditions of the recent\r\nrevolution, and this book is the result of his exhaustive study.\r\n\r\nThe important position which Turkey occupies on the highway to the\r\nFarther East from Europe has made it the subject of continuous\r\npolitical intrigue by the nations of that continent. Its interesting\r\nand romantic people and their despotic government; its natural\r\nproducts, some of them unique; its picturesque and poetical language\r\nand literature, are full of peculiar and absorbing interest, and no one\r\nwho wishes to keep abreast of the great world movements of our time can\r\nafford to neglect this stirring work.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHARLES WELSH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n_THE TURKISH PEOPLE_\r\n\r\n\r\nTurkey, once so vast and powerful, has been undergoing a gradual\r\ndismemberment for the last two centuries. Possession after possession\r\nhas been wrested from her in Europe, Asia, and Africa. On the mainland\r\nof Europe, having lost Greece, Bulgaria, Roumania, Servia, Bosnia,\r\nCroatia, and Herzegovina, as well as those regions on the northern\r\nshores of the Black Sea (once a Turkish lake) which now form part of\r\nSouthern Russia, Turkey is left with but a narrow strip of territory\r\nstretching across the centre of the Balkan Peninsula from the Black Sea\r\nto the Adriatic.\r\n\r\nThe despotic system of government in Turkey worked well enough so long\r\nas she was a conquering and expanding nation; but so soon as she ceased\r\nto be this, and was hemmed in by Christian Powers strong enough to\r\ncheck her advance, the system, being incompatible with progress, failed\r\nto hold the Empire together and disintegration set in. The internal\r\ndisorders caused by the evils of her administration and the cupidity\r\nand treachery of her powerful European neighbours threatened Turkey\r\nwith extinction. Russia and Austria waged successful wars against her\r\nand possessed themselves of her frontier provinces, and at the same\r\ntime the disaffected Christian populations of European Turkey were\r\nencouraged to rise and gain their independence. So it came about that\r\nGreece, Bulgaria, and other kingdoms and principalities were carved out\r\nof Turkey, and up to within a few months ago Christian peoples within\r\nand without her frontiers were quarrelling over a further projected act\r\nof spoliation that would indeed have been for Turkey the beginning of\r\nthe end—the partition of Macedonia.\r\n\r\nFor the oppression, corruption, and incompetence that characterised\r\ntheir government the Turkish people themselves were held responsible\r\nby a large section of public opinion in Western Europe. There is\r\na saying to the effect that a nation has the government which it\r\ndeserves, and this may be true if a nation is free to work out its\r\nown salvation. But in the case of Turkey the people were allowed no\r\nchance of obtaining the government which they deserved; for it was to\r\nthe interest of Turkey’s powerful enemies to conserve the evils of the\r\ndespotic rule, and whenever the Turks made an effort to put their house\r\nin order some Christian Power, fearing lest a reformed Turkey might\r\nprove a strong Turkey, fell upon her with armed force or stood in the\r\nway of the projected changes. Moreover, the Powers that were bent upon\r\nself-aggrandisement at Turkey’s expense saw to it that there should\r\nbe no peace within her borders and stirred up trouble, exciting the\r\nChristian peasants to rise, and fomenting disturbances that might serve\r\nas pretexts for a policy of intervention and annexation. No methods\r\nwere too unscrupulous for the Powers in question. For example, among\r\nmany other _agents provocateurs_ was a certain Dervish who, some years\r\nago, as the paid secret agent of Russia, acting under instructions,\r\npreached a holy war against _giaours_ in Asia Minor and excited the\r\nMussulman population to attack the Christian inhabitants. One could\r\nquote many other stories to illustrate the treachery of Turkey’s\r\nenemies and the unfair treatment which has been accorded to her.\r\n\r\nAnd so Turkey, by her own bad government and by the machinations of\r\nthose who lusted after the rich possessions that were still left to\r\nher, was being steadily dragged down to her ruin. Even her best friends\r\ndespaired of her regeneration; for reform from _without_ administered\r\nby the Powers would mean the loss of her independence, while reform\r\nfrom _within_ seemed impossible of attainment. Turkey appeared to be\r\ndestined to early effacement from the map of Europe, when, lo! of a\r\nsudden, the Turks themselves—all that was best and most patriotic of\r\nthe manhood of the Empire—came boldly forward to make a desperate last\r\nstand in the defence of the integrity of their beloved fatherland. The\r\n“Young Turks” threw off the despotism that had all but destroyed their\r\ncountry and seized the reins of government, displaying a firmness,\r\njustice, wisdom, and moderation in their almost bloodless revolution\r\nthat have won for them the admiration of all honest men throughout\r\nthe civilised world. It looks very much as if these men are about to\r\nprove to the world that reform can come from _within_ even in Turkey,\r\nprovided that the Turks are now given the chance which they have\r\nnever had before, and greedy foes are not permitted to frustrate the\r\naspirations of a people freed at last.\r\n\r\nThose who know and therefore like and respect the Turkish people\r\nrejoice that the ancient friendship between England and Turkey has\r\nbeen restored, and that at last the English people are beginning to\r\nrealise the injustice that a large section of public opinion has\r\ndone to a noble race, for over thirty years. There was a time when\r\nthey understood the Turks better. During the Crimean war the British\r\nofficers had the opportunity of acquiring an intimate knowledge of\r\ntheir allies; many firm friendships were then made which were kept up\r\nthrough life, and so large and influential were the relations thus\r\nbrought about between the gentlemen of the two countries that they\r\ndirected English diplomacy in Turkish affairs for many years. It may\r\nseem, and it ought to be, unnecessary to preface this little work\r\nwith an explanation of what manner of men these Turks are; but so\r\ngrossly have they been misrepresented, and so widespread has been the\r\nmisconception concerning them, that a few words on this subject may not\r\nbe out of place.\r\n\r\nFive and a half centuries have passed since the Mussulman Turks—a\r\nCentral-Asian people akin to the Mongols—having seized the Asiatic\r\npossessions of the decaying Byzantine Empire, crossed the Bosphorus\r\nand, extending their conquests, established themselves firmly in\r\nEurope. It is possible that in Asia Minor peasants of pure Turkish\r\nblood may still be found, but in European Turkey—that “lumber room\r\nof many races”—the strong and noble Turkish stock has been so\r\nlargely intermingled with a number of other races that the racial\r\ncharacteristics of the Osmanli have practically disappeared. It is more\r\nrare to find features of the Mongolian stamp among the modern Turks\r\nthan among the Christian peoples over whom they rule. The Bulgarians,\r\nfor example, though speaking a Slav tongue and generally considered as\r\na Slav people, often have the flat faces, the projecting cheek-bones,\r\nthe small oblique eyes, that betray their descent from the nomads of\r\nthe Asiatic steppes.\r\n\r\nThere are no handsomer people in Europe than the Turks, for here the\r\ncrossing of many virile breeds has resulted in the development of a\r\nvery fine race of men. The modern Turk is a Caucasian of the highest\r\ntype, and combines in himself some of the best qualities of the East\r\nand West. It is true that some of his Eastern qualities stand in the\r\nway of what the energetic Western world calls progress. The Turk\r\nis improvident and often a spendthrift; he is a fatalist, enduring\r\npatiently whatever ill fortune or suffering fate may bring him, but\r\ndisplaying an indolent indisposition to struggle against destiny. _Dieu\r\naide qui s’aide_ expresses a motive for action which is opposed to his\r\nMoslem fatalism. But difficult though he may be to rouse to effort,\r\nonce roused he displays great energy and stubbornness of purpose, as\r\nhas been recently proved to the world by the careful preparation and\r\ndetermined carrying through of the Turkish revolution. At any rate,\r\nthe faults of the Turks are for the most part amiable ones, and most\r\npeople who have travelled in the Near East will agree with an authority\r\non the politics of that region, who replied as follows to a question\r\nput to him by an interviewer: “The men that I liked best among all\r\nthat I met in the East were Turks. In some respects the Turk struck me\r\nas more like an Englishman and more like a gentleman than any of the\r\nother races except the Magyars. He is a quiet, manly fellow, with great\r\nrepose and charm of manner, and does not wear his heart on his sleeve.\r\nEuropeans who live in the country look on the Turk as an honest man and\r\na man of his word.”\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the corrupt officialdom created by the\r\nPalace, which had a degrading influence on everything in touch with it,\r\nis not representative of the Turkish people. The typical Turk possesses\r\nthe virtues and the failings of a conquering and dominant race. He\r\nis courageous, truthful, and honest amid races not conspicuous for\r\ntruthfulness or honesty, some of which are likewise lacking in courage.\r\nThe Turk, moreover, is shrewd and gifted with common sense, and he is\r\nnot a visionary, as are the Arabs and some other peoples holding the\r\nMoslem faith. He has not the quick wits of some European peoples, and\r\nmay perhaps be described as being somewhat stupid, in the same sense\r\nthat the Englishman is stupid in the eyes of a neighbouring, brighter\r\nrace; but this same stupidity, or whatever else we may call it, happily\r\nhas preserved the Turk from the seeing of visions, and consequently no\r\nimpossible ideals, no wild dreams for the reconstruction of society,\r\nhave led his practical and common-sense revolution into those dreadful\r\nroads of bloodshed and anarchy which more imaginative nations,\r\nshrieking liberty, have blindly followed to tyrannies more oppressive\r\nthan the worst of despotisms.\r\n\r\nThose who know him best also claim that the Turk is hospitable,\r\ntemperate, devoid of meanness, sincere in his friendships—once he is\r\nyour friend he is always your friend—and, though his enemies have\r\nrepresented him as very much the reverse, gentle and humane. Of the\r\nsteadfastness of his friendship I have had experience. When a Turk is\r\nyour friend you can implicitly trust him, even though he be, what the\r\nconditions of his country have sometimes made him, a murderous outlaw.\r\nI have had friends among Turkish brigands myself, and Sir William\r\nWhittall, who knows the Turks as well as any Englishman can, writes in\r\nthe following sympathetic way of his robber friend Redjeb: “Peace be\r\nto his ashes! He is dead now. Brigand or no brigand, I had a sincere\r\nadmiration for the man as a man. His faithfulness was like unto that of\r\na dog, and he saved my life at the risk of his own. I have had many\r\nincidents with brigands in Asia Minor during my fifty years of sport,\r\nand I must say that as long as they were Turks, and I had assisted some\r\nfriends or villages of theirs, which I always made it a point to do\r\nwhen I frequented the wild regions, I never feared any accidents; and\r\nthough I might often have been taken, I never was. I would not like to\r\ntrust Christian brigands in the same fashion.”\r\n\r\nGentleness and humanity are among the most marked characteristics of\r\nthe Turk. With his ferocity in war when his passions are roused I\r\nshall deal later, but of his kindliness and charity in his dealings\r\nwith his fellow-men there can be no doubt. In no European country\r\nare animals treated so kindly as they are in Turkey. A Turk never\r\nill-uses his horse or his ox or his domestic pets, and the wonderful\r\ntameness of these creatures in Turkey testifies to this good trait.\r\nIn Constantinople the pariah dogs lie about the streets in their tens\r\nof thousands; they live partly on garbage and partly on the scraps of\r\nfood which even very poor Turks put out for them. These dogs, though\r\nfighting among themselves, display nothing but friendship for, and\r\nconfidence in, man. They never move for one as they sprawl across the\r\nnarrow pavements, for they know that no Turk would have the heart to\r\nkick them out of the way. A few years ago an American offered a very\r\nlarge sum for the right to clear Constantinople of its pariah dogs,\r\nhis object being to sell their skins to the glove makers. The populace\r\nraised a howl of indignation when they heard of this, and had not\r\nthe scheme been abandoned serious riots would have occurred. There is\r\nno need for a society for the prevention of cruelty to animals in a\r\nTurkish town.\r\n\r\nIt has often been maintained by the enemies of the Turk that his\r\nMohammedan fanaticism makes his continued occupation of any portion of\r\nChristian Europe undesirable. But in justice to the votaries of the\r\nMoslem creed one ought to bear in mind, in the first place, that early\r\nMohammedanism never persecuted the Christian religion in the ferocious\r\nfashion that Christianity persecuted Mohammedanism, as for example in\r\nSpain. The Moslems were taught that it was their duty to convert or\r\nexterminate the idolatrous heathen, but to respect “the people of the\r\nbook.” Did not Mohammed himself spread his cloak upon the ground for\r\nthe Christian envoys who came to him, treating them with honour; and\r\ndo not the Mussulmans believe that on the day of judgment the Judge\r\nwill be Jesus Christ, while the Prophet Mohammed will stand at His\r\nside as the Intercessor? When the Turks conquered the territories of\r\nthe Christians they did not massacre the Christians, neither as a rule\r\ndid they enslave them, and they did not interfere with their religion;\r\nunder the more equitable Moslem rule the conquered Greeks found\r\nthemselves less heavily taxed and generally better off than they had\r\nbeen under the rule of the emperors of the decaying Byzantine Empire.\r\nTo Jews also, as being worshippers of the one God, they extended a like\r\ntolerance; and it was to Turkey—where they are numerous and prosperous\r\nand still speak an old Spanish dialect—that the Jews fled when they\r\nwere driven out of Spain by the persecutions of Ferdinand and Isabella.\r\n\r\nThat later on the Mohammedans developed a fierce anti-Christian\r\nfanaticism is largely due to centuries of political conflict with\r\nChristian peoples, and to the many wars that have been fought to\r\ndefend Islam against the never-ceasing aggressions of Europe. Within\r\nthe Turkish Empire itself, for example in Arabia and in Northern\r\nAlbania, dangerously fanatical Moslem populations are to be found, but\r\nthese are not people of Turkish blood. The majority of the Turks of\r\nany education, though religious, are not fanatics, and on this very\r\naccount are regarded as indifferent Mussulmans and often frankly called\r\n_kafirs_ by the bigoted Arabs. Of all the various peoples who inhabit\r\nTurkey the Mussulman Turks are undoubtedly the least intolerant. The\r\nChristians of different sects there hate each other as no Turk hates a\r\nChristian and no Christian hates a Turk. The orthodox Greeks and the\r\nBulgarian schismatics in Macedonia employ all methods of barbarism\r\nin their persecutions of each other. When Bulgaria formed part of\r\nTurkey the Bulgarians had often to petition the Turks to protect them\r\nagainst the fanatical Greeks. The Catholic Latins, too, in Turkey,\r\nbeing in a minority, would doubtless have been exterminated by their\r\nfellow-Christians had it not been for the protection extended to them\r\nby the Turks, with the result that they are grateful and loyal to the\r\nOttoman rule. The recent revolution appears to have brushed away almost\r\ncompletely what religious fanaticism there was still left among the\r\nMohammedan Turks, and the Young Turks themselves, the deliverers of the\r\nnation and its real rulers, are entirely free from it. I have conversed\r\nwith hundreds of these Young Turks and have many friends among them,\r\nand in no country have I come across more broad-minded and tolerant\r\nmen. There is no doubt that Islamism has of late years undergone a\r\nmodernising process, thereby gaining strength. The Sheikh-ul-Islam\r\nhimself, as head of the _Ulema_—the Doctors of Law whose duty it is to\r\ninterpret the judicial precepts of the Koran, and who have hitherto\r\ncomposed the most fanatical and conservative element in Turkey—has been\r\nat great pains to impress it upon the Mussulman people, upon whom from\r\nhis position he exercises such great influence that the Constitution\r\nwhich has been granted to them, though introducing the principle of\r\ncomplete equality between Mussulmans, Christians, and Jews, is quite in\r\naccordance with the teachings of the Koran.\r\n\r\nAs I find myself embarked on this somewhat long defence of the Turkish\r\npeople I may as well deal with another popular misconception concerning\r\nthem. It is often urged that the Mohammedan institution of polygamy,\r\nwith its consequent degradation of women, is incompatible with the\r\nprogress or with the moral and mental well-being of a race, and that\r\nthis by itself makes the Turk unfit to rule in Europe. Now it must be\r\nremembered that many distinct races profess the Mohammedan religion,\r\nand that some of these are barbarian and others decadent, even as\r\nare some of the races that profess Christianity; but it is not fair,\r\nbecause the Turks happen to be Mussulmans, that they should be credited\r\nwith the faults and vices of some other Mussulman peoples. I have no\r\nintention of discussing the effects of polygamy, but I may point out\r\nthat the Turk, unlike the Arab, appears to be not really polygamous by\r\nnature, and that whatever may happen in some other Moslem lands there\r\nis no degradation of the women in Turkey. The Turkish peasant women\r\nare as far from being degraded as any other women of their class in\r\nEurope. It may astonish some Englishmen to learn that the simple-living\r\nTurk of the upper and middle classes, though his religion permits him\r\nto marry four wives, rarely marries more than one. Of the Young Turks\r\nwhom I have met, not one, I believe, has more than one wife, and I\r\nhave heard several of them speak with disapproval of the custom of\r\npolygamy. English ladies who have friends among the Turkish ladies have\r\ntold us how refined, charming, and—in these latter days—well educated\r\nthey are. As most Turkish gentlemen retain the old customs in their\r\nfamily life, the Englishman visiting the house of a Turkish friend\r\nhas no opportunity of seeing his wife, but his little daughters up\r\nto the age of about twelve years are usually brought in by the proud\r\nfather to see the visitor, just as they might be in England, when\r\nthe pretty manners, the intelligence, and the careful education which\r\nthey have evidently received (they nearly always speak French or some\r\nother European language) tell their own tale. The constant and deep\r\nveneration which a Turk entertains for his mother through life belies\r\nthe nonsense that is sometimes talked concerning the condition of the\r\nwomen in Turkey. The Turkish woman, too, respected and trusted, is\r\nmuch freer than most people in this country imagine, and, as I shall\r\nexplain later on, the revolution largely owed its success to her brave\r\nco-operation.\r\n\r\nOne ought to be able to form some idea of the character of a people\r\nfrom its literature. Turkish literature, the classical form of which\r\nwas borrowed from that of Persia, has, like many other things in\r\nTurkey, been undergoing a process of modernisation; it has for some\r\nyears been under the influence of Western, more especially of French,\r\nliterature; and simplicity and lucidity in the expression of thought\r\nhas taken the place of the intentional obscurity and artificiality that\r\ncharacterise Oriental writing. Mr. Stanley Lane Poole, in the Turkey\r\nvolume of the excellent “The Story of the Nations” series, concludes\r\nhis chapter on Turkish men of letters as follows: “The tone of the\r\nimaginative literature of modern Turkey is very tender and very sad.\r\nThe Ottoman poets of to-day love chiefly to dwell upon such themes as\r\na fading flower, or a girl dying of decline; and though admiration of\r\na recent French school may have something to do with this, the fancy\r\nforces itself upon us, when we read those sweet and plaintive verses,\r\nthat a brave but gentle-hearted people, looking forward to its future\r\nwithout fear, but without hope, may be seeking, perhaps unconsciously,\r\nto derive what sad comfort it may from the thought that all beautiful\r\nlife must end in dismal death.” I have met some of these modern Turkish\r\npoets, very manly fellows, though their work has the melancholy tinge\r\ndescribed above, for which, in my opinion, a long political exile in a\r\nforeign land and sorrows for the evil fortunes of their beloved country\r\nare largely responsible. But now the days of Turkey’s mourning are\r\nover, and the more recent poems of these men, who are sturdy patriots\r\nand not decadents, are beginning to reflect the triumph, enthusiasm,\r\nand hope which have characterised the Young Turks since their\r\nsuccessful revolt against the despotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n_ATROCITIES_\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch are the people who but recently were spoken of as the “unspeakable\r\nTurks.” For thirty years they have suffered from the crudest of\r\ntyrannies and have met with but scant sympathy in Western Europe; for\r\nit was “their double misfortune,” to quote the words of a writer in\r\nthe _Times_, “to be oppressed and to be compelled to bear the odium\r\nof the cruelty of the oppressor. Their fine qualities were obscured\r\nto the world. Their name was a byword for cruelty, violence, and\r\nfanaticism.” In England, if one attempted to defend the Turk, one\r\nwas regarded as a cold-blooded villain by a great many good people.\r\nA considerable section of the English lost their sense of fair play\r\nso soon as the Turkish question became at the same time a pawn in our\r\nparty politics and an excitant of religious bigotry; for one political\r\nparty became avowedly anti-Turkish, while numbers of well-meaning\r\nbut unjust Christian people approached the subject from the point of\r\nview which made a Mussulman appear everything that is vile, and so\r\nespoused the cause of Turkey’s Christian enemies as being of necessity\r\nthe right one. It was the same sort of sectarian narrow-mindedness\r\nthat impelled well-known preachers—not members of the English State\r\nChurch to pray from their pulpits for the success of the Americans\r\nin their war with Spain, because Spain was Catholic and the “land of\r\nthe Inquisition.” Thus it came about when Turkey’s Christian subjects\r\nrebelled in the seventies and the Russians came to their assistance,\r\nthe Turks were held up to opprobrium as fiends in human shape, the\r\nmurderers, violators, and mutilators of the gentle Christians. Any\r\npiece of evidence, second-hand or third-hand, however extravagant,\r\nwas implicitly believed by these people provided it was against the\r\nTurks, whereas whenever charges of committing atrocities were brought\r\nagainst Russians and Bulgarians by the most trustworthy eye-witnesses a\r\nvery different standard of evidence was set up, and it was held to be\r\nincredible that Christians could do these things.\r\n\r\nYet what were the facts? In the first place, there can be no doubt\r\nthat Russia, bent on the destruction of Turkey and aggrandisement at\r\nher expense, had stirred the Bulgarians into rebellion by means of\r\n_agents provocateurs_. Travellers who visited Bulgaria in the years\r\npreceding the Russo-Turkish war state that the Bulgarian peasantry\r\nwere more prosperous than any in Turkey. It is unlikely that they\r\nwould have risen of their own accord, seeing that they had good reason\r\nto be grateful to the Turks, who had come to their rescue when their\r\npersecuting Greek fellow-Christians had set themselves to exterminate\r\nthe Bulgarian Church, language, and nationality. In the next place,\r\nit is now realised that the Christians and not the Turks initiated\r\nthe atrocities. The Bulgarians, when they rose, plundered and burnt\r\nthe villages of the Turks, committed the most shocking cruelties,\r\nand massacred unarmed Moslem men, women, and children. There is\r\ngood evidence to show that the Turkish regular troops behaved with\r\nconsideration to the Christian population until their passions were\r\nroused by the barbarities committed by the Bulgarians and Russian\r\nCossacks; then indeed the Turks, exasperated by the sufferings of\r\ntheir co-religionists, engaged in terrible reprisals which aroused the\r\nindignation of the civilised world. Ferocious when provoked by the\r\ncruelty of others, the Turks are the last people to engage in wanton\r\ncruelty, and those who like myself have seen their armies in time of\r\nwar can vouch for their humane treatment of prisoners and of the civil\r\npopulation in an enemy’s country. It must be remembered, too, that the\r\nworst atrocities proved against the Turks in Bulgaria were committed\r\nnot by Turkish regulars but by fanatical Circassians and by the\r\nBashi-Bazouks, ill-disciplined irregulars recruited from the criminals\r\nand ne’er-do-wells of any races, detested by the Turks themselves for\r\ntheir excesses.\r\n\r\nThe evil name thus acquired by the Turk during the war with Russia\r\nstuck to him through the years that followed, and ignorant, prejudice\r\nhas been wont to put down to him all the cruel deeds committed by the\r\nPalace Camarilla, including the terrible Armenian massacres, which\r\nwere perpetrated, not by the Turks—who regarded these crimes with\r\nloathing—but by the savage Kurds and Lazes, at the instigation of\r\nthose who misruled the unfortunate country. In many ways the Turks\r\nhave suffered more from the oppressive despotism than their Christian\r\nfellow-subjects, but all the sympathy of our humanitarians has been\r\nfor the latter, and they had little pity or sympathy to spare for the\r\nMussulman. Of late years the political intriguers in Athens, Sofia,\r\nand Belgrade have been supporting bands of Christian brigands in\r\nMacedonia, with the object of forwarding the rival interests of the\r\nGreeks, Bulgarians, and Servians, in anticipation of the scramble over\r\nthe partition of that rich country on the breaking up of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire. These bands have been burning villages and murdering women and\r\nchildren, their excesses being committed against both Christians and\r\nTurks. In April, 1908, a Bulgarian band burnt a Greek priest at the\r\nstake. The incident aroused no comment. What a howl would have been\r\nraised had the Mussulmans done this thing!\r\n\r\nSo the Christian had plenty of friends and the Turk few. No voices were\r\nraised to defend him and to explain the injustice that was done him.\r\nNeither was he the man to put his own case before his European critics;\r\nfor the Turk is better with the sword than with the pen; he is not so\r\ncunning as Greek or Bulgarian in carrying on a newspaper campaign,\r\nor in the weaving of effective misrepresentations; as a rule he is\r\ntoo proud to defend himself against calumny, and treats with silent\r\ncontempt those who snarl at him. Moreover the Turk, being essentially\r\na patriot, would not appeal for help to foreign Governments as did\r\nthe Christians. To quote from an article recently written by Halil\r\nHalid: “The Mussulmans suffered as much as, indeed in many places more\r\nthan, the Christians, from a despotic _régime_. They had submitted,\r\nnot to the will of their rulers, but to their hard fate, because\r\nTurkish patriotism, which has not until recently received fitting\r\nattention, was too great to allow them to invite outside interference\r\nor help in the national struggle against native tyranny. Never\r\ndespairing of gaining their end, the people of Turkey have waited for\r\nan opportune moment to strike a blow at the foundations of despotism,\r\nand this promptly and with the least possible risk of international\r\ncomplications. They have thus submitted to the indignities and\r\nhardships caused by the tyranny of their own rulers, rather than expose\r\nthemselves to the patronising interference of any foreign Power.”\r\n\r\nThere are thus excuses for the misunderstanding that poisoned the\r\nminds of so many Englishmen against their former friends, the Turks.\r\nGreeks, Bulgarians, and others who sought the dismemberment of Turkey\r\nand the appropriation of Macedonia voiced their cause loudly, not only\r\nwith just denunciations of the Turkish oppression of the Christians,\r\nbut with many plausible inventions. That the Turkish side of the\r\nquestion was so rarely heard was also largely due to the fact that,\r\nduring the few years preceding the revolution, it became ever more\r\ndifficult for Englishmen in Turkey to have friendly intercourse with\r\nthe Turks themselves. The intervention of the English Government\r\nto introduce reforms into Turkey, and the action of the Balkan and\r\nArmenian Committees, which were wrongly believed by the Sultan and\r\nhis advisers—and appear still to be believed by all Germans and\r\nAustrians—to be the agents in advance of the perfidious English\r\nGovernment, so intensified the hatred of the Turkish despotism against\r\nEngland that it was practically made a crime for a Turk, especially\r\nif he was suspected of Liberal tendencies, to receive an Englishman\r\ninto his house. If a Turk was even seen to speak to an Englishman in\r\nConstantinople the spies reported the fact to the Palace; and, as I\r\nshall explain later, to manifest sympathy for the British cost many\r\na Turk his life and liberty. Thus the intelligent tourist, or the\r\nglobe-trotting M.P., who visited Constantinople in those days was\r\nnot in a position to pick up accurate information. His doings and\r\ngoings would probably be watched by spies, especially if he was a\r\nmember of the Balkan Committee. Though he knew it not, he would find\r\nno opportunity of conversing with Turks save such as were the secret\r\nagents of the Palace. His dragomans would be Greeks or Armenians, who\r\nmight speak to him of the grievances of the Christian subjects of the\r\nSultan, but certainly not of the grievances of the Turks. So, too, was\r\nit with most of the journalists. If they were anti-Turks they sought\r\ninformation from the members of the Greek and Bulgarian bands, and if\r\nthey were pro-Turks they were on friendly terms with officialdom—they\r\nhad audiences with ministers, possibly with the Sultan himself; and as\r\nall Turks are very polite, they often left the audience-chamber charmed\r\nwith despotism, and explained, in the papers they represented, that\r\nthe Young Turk party was either a myth or a small and impotent group\r\nof malcontents, who, during a sojourn in Paris, had absorbed the wild\r\ntheories of the internationalists and anarchists.\r\n\r\nTo drive the Turks “bag and baggage” out of Europe was the proclaimed\r\npolicy of many ignorant humanitarians. The expulsion of the Turkish\r\nrule would indeed have been followed by a bag-and-baggage exodus, for\r\nbut a small minority of Mussulmans would have remained in the land to\r\nbe governed by a Christian race. In former years Russia and Austria\r\nwere regarded as the probable inheritors of the “Sick Man’s” European\r\nterritories, and it is certain that the rule of either of these would\r\nbe intolerable to the Turks. One remembers how the Circassian and\r\nBosnian Mussulmans emigrated in large numbers into Turkey when their\r\ncountries were occupied respectively by the Russians and Austrians.\r\nThese emigrations were accompanied by great suffering and loss of\r\nlife, due largely to the incapacity and callousness of the Turkish\r\nGovernment, which, while undertaking to found colonies of the refugees\r\nin Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and other parts of the Empire, practically\r\nleft them to starve. The humanitarians would have realised the cruelty\r\nof their proposal had they seen, as I did, the pitiful sights in\r\nNorthern Albania thirty years ago. The Bosnian Mussulman peasants,\r\nescaping from the rule of Austria, were pouring into that portion\r\nof Turkish territory. Men, women, and children were slowly crawling\r\nacross the snow-covered country in the bitter winter weather, weak\r\nand listless with hunger and cold, often frost-bitten, hundreds of\r\nthem failing by the way, so that it was a common thing to see frozen\r\ncorpses lying by the roadside. The Albanians themselves were in a\r\nhalf-starving condition after the ravages of the war, and could render\r\nlittle assistance to the wretched refugees. Under the bag-and-baggage\r\nscheme there would be an exodus of millions and unimaginable suffering.\r\nHad Europe committed this crime the retribution might have been heavy.\r\nThe Sultan would still have been the Caliph of the Moslem world, and\r\nthe Turks, driven into Asia, might have reformed their Government and\r\nset their house in order, even as they are doing now; but the Turkish\r\nawakening, instead of taking its present form, would have taken that\r\nof Pan-Islamism—the combination against the Christians of all the\r\nMussulman peoples.\r\n\r\nThe humane bag-and-baggage proposal would have meant the expulsion of\r\nnearly half the population of Turkey and the replacement of the Turkish\r\nby some other rule. But the Russianisation or Germanisation of the\r\nBalkan Peninsula would have been more disagreeable to the Christian\r\npopulation than even the domination of the Turk, while it would\r\nhave been impossible to divide the country among the neighbouring\r\nstates in such a way as to satisfy the inhabitants. In the peninsula\r\nare jumbled up remnants of every race and creed, not collected into\r\nseparate districts, but intermingling with each other, hating each\r\nother, jealous of each other—Servians dreaming of the larger Servia,\r\nBulgarians of the larger Bulgaria, Greeks of the larger Greece—their\r\nterritorial claims, based upon race distinctions, all overlapping\r\neach other; an entanglement of rival rights and interests impossible\r\nof unravelment. Neither of these Christian races would submit to be\r\nruled by the other. For example, there can be no doubt that a Bulgarian\r\nwould rather be governed by the Moslem Turk than by the Greek. And amid\r\nall these races, more numerous than any of them taken singly, are the\r\nruling Turks, who own the fee simple of the land by the best of titles,\r\nconquest. They are the strong race whose bearing is in strong contrast\r\nto the servility of some of the races in their midst. They are the\r\nmasterly people fit to rule the others; for whatever peace fanatics may\r\nsay, only people ready to fight bravely in defence of their possessions\r\nare fit to own possessions. We have not arrived at the state of\r\ncivilisation when it can be otherwise. Even our humanitarians, who\r\nunknown to themselves have some of the old Adam in them, respect those\r\nwho can use the sword; for whereas they sympathise with the aspirations\r\nof the plucky Bulgarians they pay little heed to the Greeks, who,\r\nthough the noisiest of the claimants to Turkey’s heritage and having\r\nvast pretensions which extend to every piece of territory in Europe and\r\nAsia that ever belonged to any of the states of ancient Greece, are\r\namong the feeblest people in the world in the practice of war.\r\n\r\nIt needs a strong rule to keep the rival Christian sects of the Balkan\r\nPeninsula in order and to prevent them from cutting each other’s\r\nthroats, lopping off each other’s ears, and burning each other’s\r\npriests. The Turks can provide that strong rule; and if we add to the\r\nTurks the Mussulmans of other race in the country—Albanians, Moslem\r\nBulgarians, Circassians, and others—we have nearly half the total\r\npopulation united by a common religion, as the Christians certainly are\r\nnot. The Young Turks may now prove that Lord Palmerston, after all, was\r\nright when he said that the rule of the Mussulman Turk was the only\r\none that could combine the different races and sects of Turkey in one\r\nkingdom. The Turks have no ambition to recover the territory which they\r\nhave lost, but they are determined to hold on to what still remains to\r\nthem. With a strong Turkey, in close alliance with a federation of the\r\nSlav states to the north of her, we may yet see a quiet and contented\r\nBalkan Peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n_EARLY REFORMERS_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is about a century ago that Western ideas began to influence the\r\nbetter Turkish statesmen and efforts were made to reform the system of\r\ngovernment and bring it into harmony with modern civilisation. Mahmud\r\nII, who came to the throne in 1808, and his successor, Abd-ul-Mejid,\r\nwho died in 1861, were wise and reforming monarchs, who were advised\r\nby enlightened statesmen such as Reshid Pasha, at whose instance, in\r\n1839, the edict known as the Hatti-Sherif of Gulhane was promulgated.\r\nThis edict, which has been called the Magna Charta of Turkey, promised\r\nmany useful administrative and judicial reforms, and secured to\r\nthe Christian as well as Mussulman subjects of the Sultan security\r\nfor their lives, honour, and property. Again, in 1856, after the\r\nCrimean war, the Hatti Houmaioum Firman announced among other things\r\nthe complete equality in the eyes of the law of the Christians and\r\nMussulmans in Turkey. I need scarcely say that these solemn engagements\r\nhave been wholly ignored by Turkey’s recent rulers.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, on the death of Abd-ul-Mejid, Abd-ul-Aziz succeeded to the\r\nthrone of Othman. He was assisted by a group of patriotic and able\r\nstatesmen, among whom were Fuad Pasha, Rushdi Pasha, Aali Pasha, and\r\nMidhat Pasha; and for the first ten years of his reign he ruled his\r\ncountry well. He made the Turkish navy one of the most formidable in\r\nEurope; he organised the army that fought so stubbornly at Plevna;\r\njustice was administered, and the press was free to criticise the\r\nGovernment. But this promising monarch, unfortunately for his country,\r\nbroke away from the tutelage of wise men and fell under the influence\r\nof evil advisers. On the death of Aali Pasha in 1872, Mahmud Nedim\r\nPasha, a man who was fanatically anti-European and uneducated, became\r\nthe chief adviser of the Sultan, and was soon created Grand Vizier. The\r\ncharacter of the Sultan seemed now to undergo a complete change; his\r\npolicy became retrograde and reactionary; he drove from his side the\r\ngood and wise and surrounded himself with corrupt parasites, who were\r\nin many cases the ready tools of Ignatieff; for the Russian diplomacy\r\nhad gained the ascendency in Constantinople, and, as usual, was\r\nemployed in intriguing against the party of reform and organising the\r\ndisruption of the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nAnd now commenced that final struggle between the Palace and the\r\nSublime Porte which has resulted in the overthrow of the Despotism.\r\nThe Sultan, though the absolute head of the Church and State, had\r\nhitherto left the administration of the Empire to his Cabinet of\r\nMinisters chosen by himself, whose office is known as the Sublime\r\nPorte. Abd-ul-Aziz attempted to break down this system, and to centre\r\nin himself the entire rule of the country; soon the ministers became\r\nmere puppets, and the Palace was made paramount. The Sultan assumed\r\nthe complete control of the Treasury, and refused to give any account\r\nof the public revenues which he wasted. He contracted loans in Europe\r\nunder onerous conditions that endangered the very independence of the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nThe patriots among the Turkish statesmen, who had been cast out from\r\nall direction of public affairs, almost despaired of their country, and\r\nthe risings in Herzegovina and Bosnia, presaging European intervention,\r\nseemed to many to be the beginning of the end. The great Midhat Pasha,\r\nwhom the Young Turks speak of as the first martyr of their cause, had\r\nthe temerity to seek a two-hours’ private audience of the Sultan, and\r\npointed out to him with such forcible eloquence the corruption of his\r\nadministration, the incapacity of his Grand Vizier, and the certain\r\ndestruction to which he was dragging his country, that Abd-ul-Aziz was\r\nterrified, his eyes were for a moment opened, and he saw the dreadful\r\ntruth; so deposing Mahmud Nedim he appointed Midhat and Rushdi as his\r\nprincipal ministers and advisers. For three months only these reforming\r\nstatesmen were left in power, for Midhat Pasha was suddenly disgraced\r\nbecause he had expressed indignation when a favourite odalisque of\r\nthe monarch had sent a negro to him to ask him to appoint one of her\r\nservants to a provincial vice-governorship. The system of Mahmud Nedim\r\nwas reintroduced; things went from bad to worse; justice became openly\r\nvenal; ranks in the services were sold by Palace favourites; the entire\r\nadministration became grossly corrupt and disorganised; and at last, in\r\n1875, the Turkish Government had to declare itself insolvent.\r\n\r\nTurks who had the welfare of their country at heart felt that it\r\nwas necessary to put a forcible end to this state of things. On May\r\n22, 6000 Softas, the theological students attached to the mosques,\r\ninvaded the Sublime Porte and clamoured for the deposition of the\r\nGrand Vizier, while some thousands of others demonstrated in front of\r\nthe Palace. The Sultan, terrified, yielded to these demands, deposed\r\nMahmud Nedim, recalled Rushdi Pasha; and a Cabinet of reforming\r\nstatesmen, including Midhat Pasha, was formed. Then came the famous\r\n_coup d’état_. The ministers, having reason to doubt the good faith of\r\nthe monarch, decided to depose him. In the night of May 30, 1876, the\r\nPalace was surrounded by troops, the Chief Eunuch was called up and was\r\nordered to awake his master and hand him the _fetva_, or decree of the\r\nSheikh-ul-Islam, Hairoullah Effendi, in his capacity of chief expounder\r\nof the sacred law, a decree to which even a Sultan must submit. The\r\n_fetva_ was set forth in the form of a question and answer as follows:\r\n“If the Head of the Believers has so lost his reason as to ruin the\r\nState, which God has confided to his care, by foolish expenditure, by\r\nwild caprices, and if the continuation of this misrule is likely to\r\nbring on a situation which will destroy the sacred interests of the\r\ncountry, is it permissible to leave that man at the head of affairs,\r\nor ought one to deprive him of his power? The answer is, that he ought\r\nto be deprived of his power.” Thus the Sheikh-ul-Islam, in the name of\r\nthe Mohammedan religion, approved of the revolution of 1876, even as\r\ndid another Sheikh-ul-Islam declare himself in favour of the recent\r\nYoung Turk revolution and the granting of the Constitution. It is\r\nimportant to remember that despotism is not (as many suppose that it\r\nis) in accord with the teachings of the Koran, and that constitutional\r\ngovernment ought not to be acceptable to good Mussulmans. Islam, as\r\nthe Young Turks point out, condemns tyranny and encourages peoples to\r\nrule themselves. The following, for example, are passages from the\r\nKoran which have been much quoted in Turkey of late: “God loveth not\r\ntyrants”; “When a people direct their affairs by consulting among\r\nthemselves they shall get their reward.”\r\n\r\nSo Abd-ul-Aziz was deposed and Murad V became Sultan in his place. The\r\nnew monarch issued a proclamation by which he promised to carry out the\r\nreforms advocated by his minister, Midhat Pasha; and the well-wishers\r\nof Turkey rejoiced. But unhappy Turkey was not to be freed yet, and\r\nan event happened that turned hope into despair. Four days after his\r\ndeposition Abd-ul-Aziz either committed suicide or was assassinated in\r\nthe palace to which he had been removed. If he was murdered, he who\r\ncommitted the crime must have been the greatest enemy of Turkey, and\r\nnone of the ministers could have had anything to do with a deed that\r\nupset all their plans for the regeneration of their country. So soon\r\nas Abd-ul-Aziz was found dead his Circassian _aide-de-camp_, Hassan,\r\nrushed to Midhat Pasha’s house, where the ministers were assembled, and\r\nassassinated two of these whom Turkey could ill spare, Avni Pasha and\r\nRechid Pasha. This succession of tragic events so shook the weak mind\r\nof the new Sultan that he became hopelessly insane. After a reign of\r\nonly three months it became necessary to depose him, and the legitimate\r\nheir, his brother, Abdul Hamid, the present Sultan of Turkey, ascended\r\nthe throne in the autumn of 1876.\r\n\r\nAbdul Hamid, however, was not permitted to grasp the sceptre until he\r\nhad signed a document by which he undertook to grant a Constitution to\r\nhis people and to rule with justice. Indeed, he was ready to make any\r\npromises, and accepted without reserve the liberal principles of Midhat\r\nPasha and the reformers. No one in Turkey believes that he was sincere,\r\nand Sefer Bey recounts in _La Revue_ how, on the very day of his\r\nsuccession, Abdul Hamid, on his return to the Palace, after having gone\r\nthrough the traditional ceremony of buckling on the sword of Othman,\r\nspoke in the following words to a well-known Turkish general of his\r\n_entourage_: “It is Reshid Pasha who is responsible for everything that\r\nhas happened; it is that great criminal who made my father sign that\r\naccursed firman under the pressure of Europe, and by giving stupid\r\nillusions to the Turkish people has led them into wrong ways. The\r\ngovernment which our nation needs is an absolute despotism, and not the\r\npernicious _régime_ of liberty which Europe practises. I shall know how\r\nto put order in the ideas of the people, but before all, I must make my\r\nposition secure and get rid of the wretches who deposed my uncle.”\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the new reign, however, the reformers looked to\r\nthe future with hope. Midhat Pasha was appointed Prime Minister, and\r\nbegan to work out his scheme for the regeneration of Turkey. He framed\r\nhis Constitution, which established the equality of all races and\r\ncreeds, and took steps to crush the rebellion in European Turkey that\r\nwas threatening to bring about a European war. Midhat was beloved by\r\neducated and patriotic Turks, and was strongly supported by the people;\r\nhis position seemed unassailable. But before he had been four months\r\non the throne Abdul Hamid struck his first blow at liberty, and showed\r\nwhat manner of man he was. Midhat was suddenly summoned to the Palace,\r\nand on arriving there was informed that his exile had been determined\r\nupon and that he must forthwith board a vessel that was awaiting him in\r\nthe Bosphorus with steam up, and betake himself beyond the confines of\r\nthe Ottoman Empire. Then the Sultan set himself to put out of the way\r\nthe other men who had taken a part in the deposition of Abd-ul-Aziz.\r\nRushdi Pasha and the Sheikh-ul-Islam were exiled to remote parts of\r\nthe Empire, while many less distinguished Liberals disappeared, being\r\neither killed or imprisoned.\r\n\r\nMidhat Pasha, the greatest of the Turkish reformers, as an exile,\r\nlived in several European capitals, studied on the spot the principles\r\nof decent government, and formed plans for the amelioration of the\r\ncondition of his unfortunate country when the opportunity should\r\narrive. The Sultan appears to have come to the conclusion that his\r\nex-Grand Vizier might be as dangerous to the Despotism while in\r\nEurope as he had been in Turkey. A plot, the details of which are\r\nwell known, was laid to bring about Midhat’s destruction. He was led\r\nto believe that the Sultan had repented of his injustice, had come\r\nto see the errors of his illiberal policy, and desired that the able\r\nstatesman should return to Turkey to give his valuable assistance in\r\nthe reorganisation of the Empire. So, after a long exile, Midhat,\r\naccepting a treacherous invitation, came back to his native land,\r\nand was made Governor of Syria. Shortly after his appointment he was\r\ndenounced to the Palace by false accusers, who were prepared to prove\r\nthat Abd-ul-Aziz had been assassinated by Midhat’s orders. After\r\nan iniquitous trial, by judges who pretended to credit the obvious\r\ninventions of suborned witnesses, he was found guilty, and as it might\r\nhave been dangerous to execute a man so much beloved and respected, he\r\nwas condemned to imprisonment in a fortress in Arabia. There he was\r\ntreated with great inhumanity and deprived of all the comforts and some\r\nof the necessaries of life. As his strong constitution resisted these\r\nprivations for three years, he was strangled in May, 1884, by order of\r\nhis persecutors, and his head was sent to the Palace, so that there\r\nshould be no doubt about his death.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan had rid himself of all the chief friends of liberty\r\nimmediately after his accession to the throne, but, cautious and\r\nfearful by nature, he took no further immediate steps to impose\r\nabsolute despotism upon his people. Mainly with the object of\r\nhoodwinking England and winning her good-will at the critical period\r\npreceding the outbreak of the war with Russia, he proclaimed the\r\nConstitution of Midhat Pasha, and a Turkish Parliament was allowed to\r\nmeet. The Sultan imposed his will upon the Parliament and reduced it\r\nto impotence; but there were many patriotic deputies who spoke their\r\nminds freely and defied the monarch’s wrath. At last, in February,\r\n1878, shortly before the conclusion of the treaty of peace with Russia\r\nat St. Stephano, the Sultan dissolved both Houses, and, with pretended\r\nreluctance, suspended the Constitution. He next proceeded to deprive\r\nthe Sublime Porte of all power and to make the Palace supreme. The\r\nministers became mere puppets, whose submission was bought by the\r\nlicense that was allowed to them to embezzle the public funds. The\r\ncontrol of the army and navy, of foreign affairs, of the finances of\r\nthe Empire, every branch of the administration, the appointment of\r\nevery official were in the hands of the Sovereign and his corrupt\r\nCamarilla. Having a pampered Prætorian Guard to enforce his will, he\r\nheld Constantinople under martial law. It was a reign of terror; he\r\nspared none who were not for him. From the dissolution of Turkey’s\r\nfirst Parliament in 1878 until the proclamation of the Constitution\r\nin 1908 Turkey was oppressed by one of the most demoralising and\r\ndestructive tyrannies that the world has known. For the Ottoman Empire\r\nthose thirty years were the most unhappy and disastrous of its long\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n_THE SPREAD OF CORRUPTION_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sultan’s policy was directed by a narrow fanaticism. It is possible\r\nthat he sincerely believed that a cruel despotism was the best rule for\r\nTurkey. He hated the Christians, and it was his ambition to realise the\r\ndream of the Pan-Islamites, to gather together round himself as the\r\nCaliph all the followers of the faith of whatever race, so as to form\r\na strong political-religious confederation of Moslems that should keep\r\nin check the aggressions of Europe and liberate Mussulman peoples now\r\nsubject to the Christians. It was his aim, too, to withdraw all such\r\nrights as his predecessors had granted to the Christian subjects of\r\nTurkey and to revoke the irritating privileges which the Capitulations\r\nhad given to foreigners within Turkish territory—not in themselves\r\nignoble designs, but which were prosecuted by such ignoble methods as\r\nnearly to destroy instead of to strengthen the Moslem supremacy in\r\nTurkey.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary here to follow the history of Turkey under the\r\nHamidian _régime_. How, defeated in war, she was bereft of vast and\r\nrich territories; how the splendid navy, created by Abd-ul-Aziz, was\r\nallowed to fall into decay, so that when Turkey was at war with Greece\r\nin 1897, she found herself with not a single ship that could be made\r\nfit to put to sea; how her fine army was starved and neglected, so\r\nthat it became demoralised and helpless to defend her against her\r\nfoes; how corruption and the wholesale appropriation of public moneys\r\nby the creatures of the Palace brought her finances into so hopeless\r\na condition that she was tied hand and foot by her foreign creditors,\r\nand had therefore to submit to the control of several departments of\r\nher internal administration by commissions appointed by the Christian\r\nPowers; how justice was bought and sold, and promotion in all the\r\nservices was awarded to the parasite or the highest bidder; how, in\r\nconsequence of the massacres of Christians and the impotence of her\r\nGovernment to maintain order, Turkish patriots were humiliated by\r\nseeing a foreign _gendarmerie_ forced upon her by the Powers; how, in\r\nshort, Turkey became so weak and effete that even to her friends her\r\ndisintegration appeared to be the inevitable end delayed only by the\r\njealousy of the rival Powers, who, fearing for what is called “the\r\nbalance of power” in Europe, bolstered up the “Sick Man” and professed\r\na desire to preserve the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. All these\r\nthings were regarded with dismay by the Turks, and precipitated the\r\nrevolution against the Government responsible for the rapid decay of\r\nthe nation; but in this chapter I will confine myself to an account of\r\nthe particular forms which the despotic oppression of the Mussulman\r\nTurks assumed, until at last that oppression became so insupportable\r\nas to goad into rebellion not only the upper classes, but even the\r\nignorant Turkish peasants, who, serving so patiently and bravely in the\r\narmy, had hitherto been ever faithful with the faithfulness of a dog to\r\nthe Sultan’s person.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan has proved himself to be in many respects a man of great\r\nstrength of character and of exceptional ability; a subtle diplomatist,\r\nhe was able to play the European Powers against each other; and he\r\nsucceeded in the main object of his life, centralising all authority\r\nin himself at the cost of indefatigable personal labour, and making\r\nhimself the supreme master of his country. He might indeed, with his\r\nsagacity, have been an excellent monarch of the despotic Oriental\r\ntype, working for the good of his people, had it not been for one\r\nfailing which grew into an obsession and brought much woe to Turkey,\r\nand this failing was fear. Abdul Hamid was haunted by a perpetual\r\nfear of assassination; he had no trusted friends, and suspected\r\nall men; and therefore cowardice, as is always the case, called in\r\ncruelty and oppression to protect itself. He subordinated the welfare\r\nof his country to his elaborate schemes for self-preservation. He\r\ndeliberately weakened the Ottoman Empire, dividing it against itself,\r\nand demoralised his subjects so that there should be no element in the\r\nState or group of individuals strong enough to attempt his overthrow.\r\nThus he stirred up strife between the different Christian sects and\r\ninflamed Mussulman fanaticism, so that populations which before his\r\ntime had lived side by side in peace, tolerating if not loving each\r\nother, fell upon each other with sword and fire; and when his oppressed\r\nsubjects rebelled he quenched their spirit with dreadful massacres.\r\n\r\nSo, too, was it in his dealings with individuals, in the selection of\r\nhis creatures and in his treatment of them. A tyrant who is enslaving\r\nhis country naturally looks upon honest patriots with suspicion as\r\npotential rebels. He cannot well employ the services of such men as his\r\nadvisers and ministers. He also mistrusts ability, as giving a power\r\nto be dangerous. Thus Turkish gentlemen of the official class, who\r\npossessed distinction, brains, and probity, had very little share in\r\nthe administration. The Camarilla of the Sultan was mainly composed of\r\nbase and illiterate though cunning people; avaricious and unscrupulous\r\nparasites, of whom the most influential were not Turks, but Syrians,\r\nArabs, and Circassians; men who, being devoid of true patriotism and\r\nhaving the attainment of wealth as their one aim, would have no reason\r\nfor joining in a conspiracy against the Despotism. But the Sultan\r\nmistrusted even these ready instruments of his will. Having a profound\r\nknowledge of the evil side of human nature, he played off one creature\r\nagainst the other, made them jealous of each other, paid them to spy\r\nupon each other, prevented any sort of friendship between them, and\r\ngoverned them by terror. The Camarilla, selling public appointments,\r\nspread the poison of corruption that threatened to demoralise a whole\r\npeople. To quote the words of a Young Turk writer: “There was left\r\nin Turkey but one ideal, but one opening for those who aspired, and\r\nthat was to amass riches and spend them in gross sensual amusement.\r\nBut, for the attainment of this, one had to declare oneself the spy\r\nof the Palace, and to give proofs of one’s servility by sacrificing\r\nfather, mother, brother, friends, principles, conscience, all patriotic\r\nsentiments, and all humanity.”\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful that there were any honest men holding high positions\r\nduring this period, but such there undoubtedly were, though these were\r\nfor the most part narrow-minded fanatics who favoured Abdul Hamid’s\r\nPan-Islamic schemes, and were pleased to co-operate with him in\r\ndepriving the Christians of what liberties they possessed, and seizing\r\npretexts to massacre them. But to the highest offices of the State,\r\nsuch as the Grand Vizierate, the Sultan found himself compelled at\r\ntimes, in self-defence, to appoint men of capacity and high character;\r\nespecially so when, after happenings more iniquitous than usual, the\r\nrelations between Turkey and the European Powers became dangerously\r\nstrained. Thus Kiamil Pasha, concerning whose good work for his country\r\nI shall have to speak later, was several times Grand Vizier, to be\r\ndeposed as soon as he could be dispensed with; for he was not the man\r\nto be obsequious to the despot, and he was not afraid of uttering\r\ndisagreeable truths. On the whole, however, conspicuous ability became\r\na disqualification for office in Turkey; and for a public man to be\r\npopular was a crime.\r\n\r\nIn order to insure their blind obedience to him as the Padisha, it\r\nwas Abdul Hamid’s aim to keep his Mussulman subjects in a state of\r\nignorance. He knew that the liberal ideas of modern Europe had been\r\nplanted in Turkey, and he determined to uproot them, or at any rate\r\nprevent their spread. He endeavoured, not without some success, to\r\ncut Turkey off from the influence of Western progress. His subjects,\r\nwith certain exceptions, were not permitted to travel in foreign\r\ncountries, and even their goings to and fro within the Empire were\r\nregarded with suspicion. It has been suggested that he allowed his\r\nnavy to rot because he feared lest his sailors should be inoculated\r\nwith ideas about liberty while visiting Western ports; at any rate, he\r\nappears to have connived at the embezzlement by his Minister of Marine\r\nof ten millions sterling, which were to have been devoted to naval\r\nexpenditure. Realising, however, that the preservation of the Empire\r\ndepended upon the reorganisation of his army, the Sultan was compelled\r\nto provide for the education of his officers, some of whom were sent\r\nto Germany and other foreign countries, while thousands were passed\r\nthrough the Turkish military schools in Turkey itself, where they were\r\ninstructed by European teachers. Officers thus trained, however, were\r\nlooked upon as somewhat dangerous, and were attached to the Army Corps\r\nin various parts of the Empire, but not to that portion of the Turkish\r\narmy which guards Constantinople, the centre of the Despotism, and the\r\nSultan’s person; for there the pampered fanatical troops, faithful to\r\ntheir master, were officered by men who had risen from the ranks, some\r\nof whom could not even read, but who could be relied upon to carry out\r\nthe orders given to them by the Palace.\r\n\r\nAll progress was paralysed by the fear that ruled at the Palace. The\r\nintroduction of typewriters and telephones as being of possible use to\r\nconspirators was prohibited. The Press had no liberty; the strictest\r\ncensorship was exercised over all printed matter that came into Turkey.\r\nTo be found in possession of a work of Herbert Spencer’s, for example,\r\nwould mean imprisonment. The censor would not consent to the production\r\nof “Hamlet” in the theatre, because in that play the killing of a\r\nmonarch is represented on the stage.\r\n\r\nUnder the Hamidian _régime_ there was of course no recognition of\r\nthe inviolability of the domicile. The houses of educated Turks were\r\nfrequently broken into by the police in search of forbidden literature.\r\nTo such an extent was the right of public meeting denied, that it\r\nwas not safe for three or four friends to sit and chat together in a\r\n_café_. A Turk could not give a dinner-party in his own house without\r\nthe permission of the authorities, and even if he obtained that\r\npermission, some police agent would likely as not be sent to sit at his\r\ntable, as an uninvited and most unwelcome guest, taking mental notes of\r\nthe conversation and smelling out conspiracies.\r\n\r\nIt was altogether a hideous system that naturally bred all manner of\r\ntyrants, great and petty, who being the creatures of the Palace were\r\nenabled to oppress the people with impunity. There was, for example,\r\nthe infamous Fehim Pasha, chief of the secret police, who abused his\r\nofficial authority to gratify his every whim and passion, plundering\r\nand blackmailing those whose possessions aroused his avarice, killing\r\nthose who stood in his way, and, whenever his fancy was attracted,\r\nforcibly carrying off to his harem the wives and daughters of peaceable\r\ncitizens—a wretch so hated that so soon as the Constitution was\r\nannounced, the mob at Broussa, fearing him no longer, fell upon him and\r\ntore him to pieces.\r\n\r\nThen there was the great army of paid informers who preyed upon the\r\npeople. The system of _espionage_, which Abdul Hamid in his fear\r\ndevised to protect himself against conspiracy and assassination, was so\r\noppressive and cruel in its working as to render almost insupportable\r\nthe lives of such of his subjects as were regarded as suspects on\r\naccount of their good birth, enlightenment, patriotism, or honourable\r\ncharacter. The expenditure on this _espionage_ sometimes amounted to\r\nas much as $10,000,000 a year. The spies were everywhere, and were of\r\nevery rank and condition. Ministers were paid to spy on each other.\r\nA man’s house-servants, the Greek hotel-waiter who brought him his\r\ncup of coffee, the Armenian dragoman who guided the simple foreign\r\ntourist, were paid to watch and listen and send their reports to the\r\nPalace. Spies would gain a man’s friendship, worm themselves into his\r\nconfidence, and then denounce him. People were sometimes betrayed by\r\ntheir own relations. All the social relationships of the family, the\r\nmilitary college, the regiment, and the navy were undermined; for\r\nif the Palace suspected a man it would spare no effort to buy the\r\ntreason of those nearest to him. There was an atmosphere of terror and\r\nuniversal distrust. When the spy system was introduced into the army it\r\ndestroyed all _esprit de corps_. It became known that there were spies\r\namong the officers of every unit, whose business it was to watch their\r\nbrother officers; with the result that there was no comradeship even\r\namong officers of the same regiment, each suspecting the other of being\r\nthe secret agent of the Palace; they never messed together, and in many\r\ncases had never spoken to each other.\r\n\r\nAnd even the spies themselves had other spies set to spy upon them by\r\nthe all-suspicious ruler. The Sultan’s spies were in every foreign\r\ncapital—sometimes working with its secret police—to keep an eye upon\r\nthe exiles and seek evidence to entrap friends of theirs in Turkey who\r\nmight be in communication with them. And from this great army of spies\r\na flood of denunciations poured into the Palace. The denunciations were\r\nwell paid for, so the supply never failed, even when the terrorised\r\npeople avoided any conduct that could be construed into a political\r\noffence. _Agents provocateurs_ incited men to acts that would afford\r\nground for accusation. The spies did not hesitate to bear false\r\ntestimony against the innocent, and, as in the case of Midhat Pasha,\r\nthe creatures of the Palace, when desirous of ruining some individual,\r\nemployed wretches to trump up the tale that would condemn him. A friend\r\nof mine suffered long imprisonment because the secret police searched\r\nhis house and there pretended to find compromising papers which they\r\nthemselves had forged. It is scarcely necessary to add that vile people\r\navailed themselves of the system to levy blackmail by threatening\r\ndenunciation.\r\n\r\nThe denounced were often condemned without any pretence of a legal\r\ntrial. Many of the best men in the country disappeared from their\r\nfamilies never to return, their fate the _oubliette_, or death by\r\nthe cord, or the traditional dropping into the Bosphorus of a sack\r\ncontaining the victim. Exile or imprisonment for a term of years were\r\nthe punishments awarded for minor indiscretions—chance words expressing\r\ndisapproval of the methods of the Palace, or the possession of a\r\nforeign paper of liberal views. People were tortured in the Palace to\r\nbetray their friends and relations. Thousands of families in Turkey\r\nhave had to mourn members torn away after denunciations by the spies.\r\nAfter the proclamation of the Constitution about seventy thousand\r\nexiles returned to Turkey from remote parts of the Empire (the Siberias\r\nof Turkey) and from foreign countries, and how many thousands have been\r\nput to death or have died in captivity no man can tell.\r\n\r\nI may mention here that during the latter years of the Hamidian\r\n_régime_ many Turks were denounced and suffered because they\r\nmanifested friendship for the English. The Turks are not a fickle\r\npeople, and despite the thirty years’ aloofness of the English through\r\nmisconceptions regarding the Turkish people, the Turks themselves\r\nhave ever remained faithful to their old friends, and the present\r\nenthusiasm for England is no passing wave. But the Palace hated the\r\nBritish Government which had attempted to force reforms upon Turkey,\r\nand it suspected all Englishmen of sharing the views of the Balkan\r\nCommittee. On the other hand, German influence became ascendant at the\r\nPalace about twelve years ago, and remained so until the overthrow of\r\nthe Despotism; for German diplomacy is not sentimental; it did not\r\nworry the Palace with humanitarian pressure for the sake of securing\r\nthe better government of the unfortunate subjects of the Sultan; and\r\nit even assisted the Porte to thwart the efforts of the other Powers.\r\nIts main object was to further German commercial interests. The German\r\nEmbassy in Constantinople squeezed concessions out of the Turkish\r\nGovernment by curious methods, and knew well how to make use of Palace\r\nintrigues and corrupt officialism. Helped by their Government, German\r\nsyndicates, with cynical disregard of the fact that they were hurrying\r\nthe country to its ruin, worked in league with those in the Palace,\r\nwho were ready to betray their fatherland for a bribe, and secured the\r\nBaghdad railway concession with its iniquitous kilometric guarantee,\r\nand other privileges, on terms far more onerous for Turkey than could\r\nhave been obtained from other quarters, thus burdening the country\r\nwith unfair obligations, which now cripple her efforts for reform and\r\nreorganisation.\r\n\r\nBut I must not digress into the tortuous ways of Turkish finance,\r\nwhich is outside the scope of this book. Suffice it to say that German\r\ninfluence at the Palace undoubtedly intensified the Sultan’s hatred of\r\nEngland, and the obsequious spies received their cue. The English in\r\nTurkey were in no wise molested, but they were declared taboo by the\r\nauthorities. For a Turk even to be seen talking to an Englishman was\r\ndangerous. Turks feared to look towards the English Embassy as they\r\npassed it. They were forbidden to visit certain English establishments,\r\nsuch as the English book-shop in Pera, and the quaint old inn in\r\nGalata, built long ago by the Genoese, where, with a retired British\r\nsea-captain as host, naval officers, British and Turkish, had been\r\nwont to foregather in good fellowship. The spies were busily employed\r\nin denouncing such Turks as were supposed to be Anglophil. A friend\r\nof mine, who at that time held a good appointment and enjoyed a large\r\nincome, was reported by the spies as having intrigued to bring the\r\nBritish fleet to Constantinople. He was imprisoned for five years. He\r\nwas released with all other political prisoners after the successful\r\nrevolution, and came back to the world to find himself penniless; to\r\nlearn that his wife, having first become blind from unceasing weeping,\r\nhad died practically in a starving condition, and that his children\r\nwere living on charity.\r\n\r\nIt ought not to be forgotten by Englishmen that when they were engaged\r\nin their last war with the Boers, and all Europe was reviling them,\r\nthe Turks alone—and notably those of the educated classes who now rule\r\nthe country as the Young Turk party—were in sympathy with them, and\r\nsome of them suffered in consequence. A number of young officers of the\r\narmy and navy, and others, put their names to a document in which they\r\nexpressed their hope that the British arms would prove successful in\r\nSouth Africa, and this they carried to the British Embassy to present\r\nto the English Ambassador. The Palace heard of this; the spies were\r\nset to work to ascertain what names appeared upon the incriminating\r\ndocument, and one by one every one of these men disappeared, being\r\nsnatched up to be put into prison, or to be sent into exile. One of\r\nthese young officers, Sirret Bey, escaped from those who arrested\r\nhim, hid himself for some time in the guise of a cook in the British\r\nConsulate, and is now one of the leading members of the Committee of\r\nUnion and Progress in Salonika.\r\n\r\nThis dreadful system of _espionage_ and the suppression of all\r\nintellectual liberty fell harder on the educated Mussulmans than on\r\nthe Christian subjects of the Sultan, for despotism had no such fear\r\nof the Greek or Armenian as it had of the patriotic Turk, and the\r\nChristians therefore were not so closely watched and had more chance of\r\npublic appointment. The Christians also had one important advantage\r\nover the Mussulman Turks in so much as their privileges allowed them\r\nto establish schools uncontrolled by the State, which provided a more\r\nliberal education than was possible in the Moslem schools. It can be\r\nreadily understood, therefore, how patriotic Turks of the upper and\r\nmiddle classes, ground down under this tyranny that gave them no voice\r\nin the administration and placed over them mean men who were hurrying\r\nthe country to its destruction, were prepared to join in any movement\r\nthat promised a fair chance of overthrowing the Hamidian _régime_.\r\n\r\nIt is also easy to understand that the Christians, who during this\r\nreign were deprived of some of their ancient rights, who were\r\ntreated with a more galling contumely than ever before, as a subject\r\nand despised people, and lived in perpetual dread of massacre and\r\noutrage, welcomed the revolution that placed them on an equality with\r\nthe Mussulmans; but how it came to pass that the Despotism became\r\nso intolerable to the masses of the Turkish people as to excite to\r\nrebellion even the patient, religious Moslem peasants, who had hitherto\r\nrevered the Sultan as their spiritual ruler as well as their monarch,\r\nand had been blindly and fanatically obedient to his will, requires\r\nsome explanation. The thrifty, hard-working Turkish peasants suffered\r\nas much as the Christians from the evils of the administration; they\r\npaid the same heavy taxes, and, like their Christian neighbours, they\r\nwere cheated by the tax-collectors, being often illegally mulcted and\r\nmost harshly treated by petty tyrants. The provincial officials did\r\nnot receive their pay regularly, and so recouped themselves by corrupt\r\npractices. Thus the rich, by paying bribes, succeeded in many cases in\r\navoiding taxation altogether, and many unfair exemptions were allowed;\r\nwith the result that in some places nearly all the burden of taxation\r\nfell upon the poor. The peasants were shrewd enough to perceive that\r\nthe money thus wrung from them did not produce any good for themselves\r\nor their country, but went to enrich the ruling clique, and that\r\nConstantinople swallowed up the huge sums that were collected in every\r\npart of the Empire. They knew that there were Ministries established in\r\ncostly palaces and maintaining a large number of well-paid officials,\r\nwhile the result of this extravagant expenditure was not anywhere to\r\nbe seen. Thus there was a Ministry of Public Works, but there were no\r\nroads or irrigation works; a Ministry of Police, but no protection of\r\nlife and property; a Ministry of Justice, and no justice; a Ministry of\r\nWar, and a starved army.\r\n\r\nBut the stoical Mussulman peasants, whose faithfulness is as that of\r\na dog, were loth to think ill of their Sultan, and they put the blame\r\nupon his Ministers as doing wrong without his knowledge. Oppression\r\nand unjust taxation by themselves would not have driven these people\r\ninto revolt, and the Young Turk movement would have had small chance of\r\nsuccess, had not Abdul Hamid neglected to secure—what would have been\r\nso easy to secure—the continued fidelity and affection of his army, of\r\nwhich the splendid peasantry of the country form the backbone. I have\r\nexplained that the Sultan was careful to pamper the Albanian and other\r\nregiments that were stationed in Constantinople to protect his person,\r\noverawe the city, and preserve the Despotism; and he saw to it that\r\nthese men duly received their pay, were well fed and properly clothed.\r\nBut with this exception the military administration of the Empire was\r\nleft wholly in the hands of the Palace favourites, who, with their\r\ncharacteristic greed and total lack of patriotic sentiment, enriched\r\nthemselves at the expense of the national defence and, with a callous\r\nindifference to the sufferings of the men, practically starved the army.\r\n\r\nIn Turkey, the burden of obligatory service is placed exclusively\r\non the Mussulman population, the Christians up till now having\r\nenjoyed complete exemption, in return for which they have paid a\r\nsmall poll-tax. The Turkish soldier is among the toughest as well\r\nas the bravest in the world, and he will undergo great hardships\r\nuncomplainingly; but there are limits even to his endurance. It would\r\nbe difficult to exaggerate the pitiable condition of these fine troops,\r\nas I have often seen them in provincial garrisons and posts in the days\r\nof the old _régime_. They never received their full rations; sometimes\r\nthey were in a starving condition; they were ill-clothed even when\r\nguarding the frontier through the hard Balkan winters; often in rags\r\nand tatters, with what remained of their uniforms supplemented with\r\nsuch native garments as they could pick up; their small pay was always\r\nin arrears; they were untrained and undisciplined—a pitiful waste of\r\nthe finest military material in Europe; and the officers themselves\r\nirregularly paid, slovenly, because they had no means to procure the\r\ndecencies of life, and estranged one from the other by the hateful spy\r\nsystem, were in no condition to inspire their men with the high spirit\r\nand _esprit de corps_ that used to distinguish the Turkish army. But\r\ndespite all this, when fighting had to be done these men remembered\r\nthat they were Turkish soldiers, and fought well.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish soldier might even have put up with all this during his\r\nfour years of service with the colours, for it takes much to rouse him\r\nto mutiny; but his oppression took one form that was intolerable to\r\nhim and to his family; the iniquitous custom grew up of keeping him\r\nwith the army for several years after his term of service had legally\r\nexpired; and the reservists also, when called out for their periodical\r\ntraining, were not infrequently carried off to remote parts of the\r\nEmpire and compelled to resume their military service for an indefinite\r\ntime. The worst lot of all was that of regiments ordered to the Hedjaz\r\nor the Yemen. In those wild regions the wretched troops, ill-equipped,\r\nwith wholly inadequate transport, and therefore always short of food,\r\nand generally provided with insufficient ammunition, had to carry\r\non long campaigns against the rebel Arabs. They thus suffered great\r\nprivations, and were not seldom defeated and massacred in consequence\r\nof the criminal negligence of Turkey’s rulers. Educated surgeons were\r\nrarely attached to these expeditions, and I have been assured by old\r\nsoldiers, who had served in Arabia, that if a man was sick or wounded,\r\nso that he was unable to march, there was little chance for him, as\r\nthere were no means for carrying him; and that in these circumstances\r\nthe ignorant and ill-paid men who played the part of army doctors,\r\nafter pretending to examine a man, would declare that he was in a\r\ndying condition, and had him buried in the sand while yet alive. It\r\noften happened, too, that soldiers in Arabia, when they did get their\r\ndischarge—probably because they were unfit for further service—were\r\nrefused transport back to Turkey on the Government ships, and, being\r\npenniless, had to remain in that alien land until charitable people, of\r\nwhom there are happily plenty among the Turks, came to their rescue.\r\nA friend of mine, who was recently British consul in a Turkish port,\r\nafter careful investigation in his particular district, found that\r\nnot more than twenty per cent. of the soldiers who were sent to the\r\nYemen returned to their homes. Whenever conscripts were carried away\r\nfor service in that dreaded land there were piteous scenes, and crowds\r\nof wailing women would come to the ship’s side to bid a last farewell\r\nto the relatives whom they never expected to see again, and already\r\nmourned as dead.\r\n\r\nUnder this shocking system of military maladministration there was\r\na great waste of Turkey’s young manhood. The rate of mortality in\r\nthe army was excessive, and this was one of the principal causes\r\nof the standstill in the numbers of this, the finest peasantry in\r\nEurope, as compared with the rapid increase of the exempted Christian\r\npopulation. These conscripts, when they were torn from their homes,\r\noften left behind them wives and families dependent on them, so the\r\nwhole Mussulman people suffered greatly through the vile treatment of\r\nthe army, that was the best part of itself and in which every one had\r\nrelatives; and at last it came about that even the faithful peasantry\r\nlost its loyalty, and, like the Moslems of the higher classes, was\r\nready to rise and sweep away the intolerable Despotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n_THE SPREAD OF EDUCATION_\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the last few years—that is, ever since the victorious war waged\r\nby Japan against Russia demonstrated to the peoples of the East that\r\nan Oriental country could break away from the conservative traditions\r\nthat oppose progress, and make itself respected as one of the great\r\ncivilised powers of the world—a remarkable growth of nationalism\r\nthroughout Asia has attracted the close attention of observers in\r\nEurope. The East that gave the West its early civilisation is now\r\ntaking its political ideals from the West. In India, China, Persia,\r\nand Egypt national parties have risen whose aim it is to free their\r\ncountries either from native despotism or from European tutelage, and\r\nto introduce forms of self-government modelled on those of modern\r\nEurope. But though much has been written and said concerning the\r\nawakening of the populations of the above-mentioned countries, it is\r\ncurious that there was no talk of any political movement in Turkey,\r\nthe nearest to Europe of the Eastern nations, until July, 1907, when\r\nthe world was suddenly amazed to learn that what appeared to be an\r\nunpremeditated military mutiny in Macedonia had compelled the Sultan\r\nto grant a Constitution to his country.\r\n\r\nThis Moslem revolution, that had been so long preparing and was so well\r\norganised, came as a complete surprise even to such European residents\r\nas knew the country best, including the Ambassadors of the Powers\r\nin Constantinople and their Consular representatives throughout the\r\nEmpire. None of these gave any warning to their respective Governments\r\nof what was coming. None of the newspaper correspondents in Turkey,\r\nnone of the globe-trotting M.P.s and members of the Balkan Committee\r\nwho were seeking an understanding of Turkish affairs on the spot,\r\nhad any inkling of the wide-spread conspiracy that was to upset the\r\nDespotism with its first blow. It had been long known, of course, that\r\nthere existed a group of exiled politicians who called themselves the\r\n“Young Turkish Party.” But this party was not taken seriously, for\r\nits critics little knew that it represented all that was intelligent\r\nand enlightened in Turkey. It was regarded as a little band of mad\r\nanarchists, or at best of foolish visionaries. An ambassador described\r\nthe movement as “innocuous,” while some regarded it as “bogus,” and\r\ndenied even the virtue of sincerity to these patriots. It was written\r\nof them in an authoritative work that “a large proportion of them\r\nhad gone into an exile with the express object of being persuaded\r\nto return,” that is, of being reclaimed by the Sultan’s bribes.\r\nAn Englishman who has lived all his life in Turkey thus summed up\r\nhis opinion: “The Young Turkey association—lacking, as it does,\r\npecuniary resources, cohesion, definite purpose, and capable leaders,\r\nhas not shown itself a formidable organisation.” Our humanitarian\r\nagitators had a complete misapprehension of the aim of the movement,\r\nand were apparently convinced that no good thing would come from the\r\nmodern Turks. But the Young Turks all the while knew what they were\r\nabout, what they wanted, and how to set to work to get it; and the\r\norganisation that for years was preparing the revolution worked so\r\nsecretly as to conceal the importance of the movement from the Palace\r\nspies themselves.\r\n\r\nNo great political movement can be of sudden growth if it is going\r\nto meet with permanent success, and though the ultimate explosion\r\nmay take by surprise those outside the movement, the revolution of a\r\nserious people is the result of long brooding and gradual development\r\nof opinion. From the time of the Sultan Mahmud II, who ascended the\r\nthrone one hundred years ago, the better and more patriotic statesmen\r\nof Turkey have made efforts to bring the system of government into\r\naccord with the methods of advancing Europe. The influence of Western\r\nideas made themselves felt throughout European Turkey, and began to\r\nmodify the intellectual outlook, the ideals, and the social customs of\r\nthe educated classes. The change, as I have pointed out in a previous\r\nchapter, was reflected in Turkish literature, which about forty years\r\nago became Western in sentiment and style, and the literary language\r\nitself was modernised by a group of writers of whom Kemal Bey,\r\nhistorian, poet, philosopher, dramatist, and novelist, was pre-eminent,\r\na genius whose works, published in Europe, were not allowed to enter\r\nTurkey during the Hamidian _régime_, but whose splendid war hymn, the\r\n“Silistria,” the penalty for singing which was formerly death, now has\r\nthe same stirring effect upon the revolutionary Moslem crowds as had\r\nthe “Marseillaise” upon the French. As the facilities for education,\r\nthe schools and colleges, multiplied in Turkey, the thirst for\r\nscientific knowledge and the culture of Western Europe spread through\r\nthe country, and with enlightenment and education naturally came the\r\nliberalism of the West and intellectual revolt against the paralysing\r\ninfluence of some time-honoured institutions and doctrines.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely accurate in these days to speak of the Turks—as one\r\noften hears them spoken of—as the finest of _Oriental_ races. The\r\nTurks have been five hundred years in Europe, during which they have\r\nintermarried largely with Europeans, and they are now to all intents\r\nand purposes Europeans, more so, indeed, than some of their neighbours\r\non the continent of Europe itself, a fact which would be more generally\r\nrecognised were it not for the barrier raised between them by the\r\ndifference of religion. Thus it has come about that the modernist\r\nmovement in Turkey is much more in touch with Western ideas than is\r\nthat of the other awakening peoples of the East, who differ so much\r\nfrom Europeans in race and character, and whose awakening has to a\r\nlarge extent taken the form of antagonism to European influence and\r\na desire to free themselves from the European hegemony. On the other\r\nhand, the Turkish reformers wish to attach the Turkish race to Europe\r\nand not to Asia; their sympathies and culture are now Western and not\r\nEastern; they wish Turkey to be recognised as one of the civilised\r\ncountries of Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is partly on this account, too, that the Young Turks have repudiated\r\nPan-Islamism, the form which the modern awakening of the Moslem\r\nnationalities has taken in some parts of the Eastern world—that\r\ncombination of Mohammedans of all races to resist the Christian\r\nnations, of which, as I have explained, Abdul Hamid himself was an\r\nadvocate. It was a movement, which, if successful, might have restored\r\nto Islam its glory and its conquering might, but it would have brought\r\nwith it the recrudescence of religious fanaticism and the impossibility\r\nof progress on modern lines.\r\n\r\nThe views of the Young Turkey party on this subject were thus expressed\r\nby one of their organs: “We Ottomans belong to a race sufficiently\r\nintelligent and practical to understand that the pursuit of the\r\nPan-Islamic designs of the visionaries would be contrary to our dearest\r\ninterests.” The Young Turk is a patriot whose first thought is for his\r\nown fatherland; he is working for its liberation and its progress,\r\nand hopes to make it again strong and respected of the nations. But\r\nPan-Islamism he leaves alone, and it will be remembered that the\r\nTurkish Constitutional party gave no encouragement to the Egyptian\r\nNationalists, whose aspirations have a Pan-Islamic character.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Young Turks have made it clear that theirs is\r\nnot an irreligious movement, and that Moslem fanatics cannot with\r\njustice accuse them of holding the rationalistic views of the French\r\nrevolutionaries, and of being bad Mussulmans. Writers have described\r\nthis as a party of agnostics. This is an incorrect statement, and were\r\nit believed by the Turkish people the Constitution would have but a\r\nshort life. There are, of course, some Young Turks who, during their\r\nexile in Paris and other European cities, have acquired rationalistic\r\nviews; but the great bulk of them are faithful Moslems. There have\r\nbeen at times agnostics in the English Parliament, but it would not be\r\nfair on that account to dub England a nation of unbelievers. The Young\r\nTurkish movement, indeed, far from being irreligious, is tempered with\r\nthe faith of Islam; but, as a French writer recently put it, with these\r\nreformers Islamism is a motive and not an end.\r\n\r\nBut the Mohammedanism of the enlightened Turks who compose the Young\r\nTurk party is a very different thing to the fanatical and narrow creed\r\nof the Arab; for it is wholly and sincerely tolerant. There has been an\r\nawakening of the religion of Islam itself, and it is now being proved\r\nto an astonished world that the ancient dogmas of Mohammedanism are no\r\nmore immutable than those of other creeds. Even as the Christianity\r\nof the Middle Ages, which burnt heretics and regarded science as the\r\ninvention of the devil, has adapted itself to modern ideas, so at last\r\nhas it come to pass with the supposed unchangeable doctrines of the\r\nMoslem Church. Enlightened Mussulmans are doing their best to bring\r\ntheir religion into conformity with modern ideas and the progress of\r\nan enfranchised people. In India, Persia, and Turkey learned doctors\r\nof the sacred law are showing that many accepted doctrines are not\r\nenjoined by the Koran itself, but have been grafted on the religion by\r\nvarious commentators; and therefore, even as the Reformation in Europe\r\nrejected much that had been superimposed on primitive Christianity\r\nand went straight back to the Bible, so does the present Moslem\r\nreformation reject many of the commentaries and go straight back to\r\nthe Koran, bringing new interpretations to bear upon the Book itself,\r\nwith the result that the doctors have been able to prove that the\r\nstrictest Mussulman can reconcile it with his conscience to accept the\r\nConstitution, that Islam is essentially liberal and democratic, that to\r\nremove oppression and corruption is to obey the teachings of the Koran,\r\nand that the granting of equal rights to Christians and Mussulmans—a\r\nreform which was the stumbling-block to many Mohammedans—is in no wise\r\nopposed to the injunctions of the Prophet.\r\n\r\nThe Young Turk movement is therefore Nationalist and not Pan-Islamic,\r\nand the policy of these reformers is opportunist. Liberal-minded\r\nthemselves, they have had to bear in mind that Turkey-in-Asia holds\r\nsome of the most conservative and fanatical Moslems in the world;\r\nso they had to go delicately to work when they began necessarily to\r\ninterfere with some cherished traditions. The exile of these young\r\nmen afforded them the opportunity of getting into contact with\r\neducated Indian and other Mussulmans, learned in Moslem law, from\r\nwhom they received considerable assistance. It will be remembered\r\nthat the Sheikh-ul-Islam, as representative of the _mollahs_ and the\r\ninterpreters of the Koran in Turkey, gave the Young Turk movement\r\nthe sanction of the faith, rebuked the fanatics who had preached\r\nagainst reform as being irreligious, and compelled them to stay their\r\nmischievous vapourings. Had it not been for this support the revolution\r\nwould have been impossible. But it may not be generally known that the\r\ntheological arguments which convinced the Sheikh-ul-Islam that this was\r\nthe right attitude to take were drawn up for him by a faithful subject\r\nof King Edward VII, Ameer Ali, ex-judge of the High Court in India, and\r\na learned exponent of Moslem thought and tradition. It was Ameer Ali\r\nwho recently introduced the deputations of Indians that waited on Lord\r\nMorley to plead the cause of the Moslems in India who, by the scheme\r\nproposed by the Government, were not to be given due representation on\r\nthe Councils.\r\n\r\nThe awakening of Turkey, the growth of liberalism, and the thirst\r\nfor knowledge among the educated Turks, including even the _Ulemas_,\r\nwhom the world regarded as the most narrow-minded of Mussulman\r\nconservatives, were largely encouraged by the very measures which Abdul\r\nHamid had taken to suppress these ideas and movements so dangerous\r\nto his despotism. Men of ability, being suspected by the Palace, and\r\nliving in perpetual dread of the _espionage_ which enveloped them\r\nlike some hideous nightmare, were unable to associate with each other\r\nfreely, and had to live isolated lives, the tedium of which they\r\nrelieved by reading, with a greater avidity than is displayed in other\r\ncountries, where men have wider scope for their intellectual energies,\r\nworks on history, philosophy, and law, and other literature which were\r\nsmuggled into Turkey across her land and sea frontiers. In latter days\r\nthe Turkish exiles in Europe succeeded in pouring prohibited literature\r\nwholesale into Turkey, but at first the supply was small; one book,\r\npassed secretly from one man to another, would be read by hundreds, and\r\nyoung men greedy for instruction even went to the pains of copying out\r\nwith their own hands bulky volumes which they had borrowed. Many a man\r\nwho considers himself to be well read would feel ashamed on discovering\r\nhow much wider than his own is the knowledge of English literature\r\npossessed by some of his friends among the Young Turks. The Sultan,\r\ntoo, unintentionally, spread far and wide the very influences which it\r\nwas his desire to destroy, for by driving thousands of educated men\r\nout of Constantinople into exile in various provinces of his Empire,\r\nhe made of these, missionaries of enlightenment, liberalism, and\r\npolitical discontent. Those also who were exiled to foreign countries\r\nand lived in Paris and other Western capitals came under the immediate\r\ninfluence of modern ideas, and, communicating with their friends in\r\nTurkey, inoculated them with their own views. Thus it came about that\r\nthe whole Empire was gradually leavened with dissatisfaction with the\r\nSultan’s rule, and the ground was prepared for the revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n_THE RISE OF THE YOUNG TURKS_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is about forty years since one first heard of a Young Turk party.\r\nAbd-ul-Aziz, having broken the early promises of his reign, had made\r\nhimself the absolute despot, and had crushed the liberalism that from\r\nthe time of Mahmud II had been gaining ground in Turkey. A number\r\nof educated men then fled from the country to Paris and London,\r\nand, calling themselves the “Young Turks,” started a movement whose\r\nobject it was to agitate for the introduction of reforms into the\r\ngovernment of their native land. Among them were men of great ability,\r\nincluding the illustrious Kemal Bey; and all the Turkish literature\r\nof that period that had any value was produced by this group of\r\n“intellectuals.” They published a paper called the _Hurriet_, which is\r\nthe Turkish word for liberty, in which they exposed in an unsparing\r\nfashion the corruption, incapacity, and lack of patriotism of the high\r\nofficials and advisers of the Sultan. The outspoken _Hurriet_ alarmed\r\nthe Palace, and was of course placed on the black list; but it was\r\nsmuggled into the country, exercised a great influence, and effected\r\nits purpose of spreading antagonism to the existing state of things.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPERIAL PALACE OF THE SWEET WATERS OF ASIA]\r\n\r\nLiberalism, as we have seen, waxed strong enough to have its way for\r\na short period in Turkey. Abd-ul-Aziz was deposed, and Midhat Pasha\r\nand the patriotic statesmen who were his associates began to introduce\r\ntheir reforms. Many of the Young Turks returned from Europe to support\r\nthe new Constitutional Government, some sitting in the short-lived\r\nParliament which the present Sultan opened on his accession to the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nThose who loved Turkey thought that the day of her regeneration had\r\ndawned at last; but the disillusionment soon came, for Abdul Hamid,\r\nin the spring of 1878, dissolved the Parliament, suspended the\r\nConstitution, and commenced his ruthless persecution of liberalism.\r\nSo the Young Turks were once again scattered over the face of the\r\nearth; some were imprisoned; some were exiled to distant provinces\r\nof the Empire; some escaped to Europe; and such as were allowed to\r\nremain in Turkey as free men, had to conduct themselves warily and shun\r\npolitics, living as they did under the sleepless eyes of the ubiquitous\r\n_espionage_.\r\n\r\nFor about fifteen years after this date one heard nothing of the Young\r\nTurkey movement. If it existed it had little if any organisation, and\r\nhad no power. To all appearances it had been stamped out effectually by\r\nthe suppressive measures that had been taken by the Palace. One came\r\nacross members of the scattered band in European cities, earning their\r\nliving as teachers of languages and in other capacities, but these\r\nrarely spoke to foreigners of what was in their hearts, for they found\r\nfew sympathisers with the sorrows of Turkey.\r\n\r\nBut though “Young Turkey” showed no signs of life it was not dead. In\r\nConstantinople and other big Turkish cities the visitor from Europe\r\nwould never hear the movement spoken of; the word _hurriet_ was, so to\r\nspeak, expunged from the Turkish dictionary, and to have been heard\r\nuttering it would have brought denunciation as a traitor. But in far\r\nparts of the Empire tongues wagged more freely, and the memory of\r\nthe reformers was kept green. In the autumn and winter of 1879 I was\r\nwandering over that wildest region of all Europe, Northern Albania,\r\nand there I found that men were speaking very plainly indeed; for the\r\n_espionage_ system was not then fully organised, and at any rate it had\r\nnot reached that lawless province, where the Government was helpless,\r\nand inspired neither respect or fear.\r\n\r\nAt the period of my visit, Albania, a country which, as I shall show\r\nlater, took a prominent part in the recent revolution, was in a\r\nstate of positive anarchy—the _gendarmerie_ on strike, the mutinous\r\nsoldiers refusing to salute their officers, neither having received\r\npay for months, while the natives held seditious meetings publicly and\r\nunmolested in the mosques of the garrison towns, in which rebellion\r\nagainst the Porte was fearlessly advocated. The army officers with\r\nwhom I conversed despaired of their country, and those who had been\r\nin Constantinople said that the one hope for Turkey—an administration\r\nunder the direction of men of Midhat Pasha’s stamp—had been destroyed.\r\nThe army doctors in Scutari—for the most part Armenians—were still\r\nmore outspoken, and advocated the deposition and even killing of the\r\nSultan. One of these doctors described the condition of the country\r\nto me in the following words: “You have no idea of what a corrupt,\r\nvile thing this Turkish Government is. The Court eats all the country.\r\nWe who work, the _employés_ of the State, the doctors, the soldiers,\r\nnever receive any pay now. As long as they think they can obtain our\r\nlabour for nothing, not a _para_ will they let slip through their\r\nfingers. Look at my case. I have been a doctor in the Turkish army for\r\nforty years. I have been through the Crimean war, over all Asia, in\r\nthe service of Turkey. I am entitled to a good pension. I have been\r\nday after day to the offices at Constantinople, and put my case before\r\nthe authorities. They put me off with all sorts of fair promises, but\r\nI knew what these meant, so went to them day after day, and worried\r\nthem so much that they decided to get rid of me in some way. ‘There\r\nis a permanent hospital in Scutari in Albania,’ they told me. ‘In\r\nconsideration of your long service we appoint you as head doctor of it.\r\nStart at once to your post.’ Now that I have travelled all this way,\r\nat my own expense, mind you, what do I find? The permanent hospital no\r\nlonger exists—it is a myth, and they knew it in Constantinople all the\r\ntime, and no doubt chuckled merrily, when I had turned my back, at the\r\nclever way they had rid themselves of the importunate old nuisance.”\r\nThen he went on to speak of the sufferings of the troops, and assured\r\nme that, faithful and obedient as they were by nature and tradition,\r\nthey would not put up with the vile treatment much longer, and that a\r\nmilitary mutiny was brewing which would destroy the Despotism within\r\na few months. In this opinion he was wrong, for thirty years had to\r\nroll by before the event which he predicted actually came to pass.\r\nHe also spoke to me of men of the Young Turk party whom he met in\r\nConstantinople during the brief period of free institutions. He much\r\nadmired their tolerance, and asked me whether I thought that the Young\r\nTurk refugees in England, by explaining Turkey’s trouble, would be able\r\nto persuade the British Government to champion the cause of Turkish\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nI discovered, too, that the fame of Midhat Pasha as an honest, just,\r\nand patriotic statesman had spread throughout that wild country, and it\r\nis not to be wondered at that the Sultan, fearing him, brought about\r\nhis destruction, and so made him the first martyr of the Young Turkey\r\ncause. The Mussulman Albanians themselves greatly revered Midhat, and\r\nregarded him as their possible saviour. They had at that time formed\r\nthemselves into the organisation known as the Albanian League, whose\r\nobject it was in the first place to resist by force of arms the handing\r\nover to Montenegro of the Albanian town and district of Gussinje,\r\nwhich, by the terms of the treaty of Berlin, Turkey had ceded to the\r\nmountain principality; and in the second place to throw off the yoke\r\nof the Sultan. The leaguesmen were then the masters of Albania. They\r\ndecided on, and carried out, the murder in Jakova of Mehemet Ali,\r\nthe general who had been sent by the Porte on the dangerous mission\r\nof negotiating this transfer of Turkish territories to her enemies,\r\nand about eight thousand of them, Albanians, Mussulman refugees from\r\nBosnia, and deserters from the Turkish army, were holding Gussinje\r\nunder the leadership of Ali Bey. Gussinje, by the way, still belongs to\r\nTurkey; for the Great Powers who had given it to Montenegro were unable\r\nto enforce with the cannon of their warships the surrender of a place\r\nlying amid the mountains of the interior; so Montenegro ultimately had\r\nto content itself with another arrangement.\r\n\r\nI crossed the mountains that lie between Scutari and Gussinje, and\r\nnarrowly escaped having my head cut off as a Russian spy on one\r\noccasion; but I succeeded in seeing a good deal of the Albanian\r\nleaguesmen. In the course of conversation with one of their chiefs he\r\nspoke to me as follows: “The men who rule in Constantinople, what do\r\nthey do for us? Tax us, rob us—that is all. And what do they give us in\r\nreturn for what they steal? Can they defend us, protect us? No! They\r\nhave sold our lands to the Montenegrins and the Austrians. I tell you\r\nthat we of the League have sworn that we will have the Turk no more.\r\nAlbania shall have her independence and the Powers shall recognise\r\nus. If they do not, we care not. Leave us alone; that is enough for\r\nus.” Then turning suddenly to me, he asked, “What do you English think\r\nof Midhat Pasha?” I told him of the esteem in which Midhat was held\r\nby my countrymen; he seemed pleased on hearing this, and said, “The\r\nTurks will not have him, but we will. What we wish is to create an\r\nindependent Albanian principality, with this good man Midhat Pasha as\r\nour prince.” I have described these experiences of mine in Albania to\r\nshow how things were shaping in the outer provinces of Turkey thirty\r\nyears ago, and how, though one heard nothing of the Young Turks in\r\nEurope, the seed they had sown had not fallen on barren ground; so that\r\nat last, when the time was ripe, the people of Turkey, remembering what\r\ntheir fathers had told them of the good Midhat, were ready to range\r\nthemselves by the side of his disciples.\r\n\r\nBut from the year 1878, when the Constitution was suspended, until\r\n1891 there appears to have been no Young Turk organisation, though the\r\nnumber of Turks who longed for deliverance from a detested _régime_\r\nwas increasing by leaps and bounds. For centuries Geneva has been the\r\nsafe asylum for men from other lands who have revolted against the\r\ntyranny of Church or Government, and there, in these days, is to be\r\nfound an interesting little society of Russian anarchists, and all\r\nmanner of malcontents and visionaries, who hatch their various plots,\r\nand when the demand arises manufacture the favourite weapon of anarchy,\r\nthe bomb. It was in this fair city, in the year 1891, that a group of\r\nTurkish refugees and exiles formed themselves into the association\r\nthat afterwards developed into the “Ottoman Committee of Union and\r\nProgress.”\r\n\r\nThe time had indeed arrived for patriotic Turks to bestir themselves\r\nand come to the rescue of their country; for it was about this\r\ndate that the most critical period of her history opened, and that\r\nvarious happenings in her European and Asiatic provinces threatened\r\nthe disruption of the Empire. In 1890 the persecuted Armenians\r\ncommenced the agitation which later on the Sultan put down with\r\nwholesale massacres. In the early nineties, too, the Bulgarians in\r\nMacedonia initiated the conspiracy which, after various small risings,\r\nculminated in the rebellion of 1903; and here, as in Armenia, the\r\nTurkish irregulars suppressed insurrection with slaughter and rapine.\r\nIndignation was aroused in Europe, especially in England, and in 1903\r\nthe British Government urged the other Powers to join her in compelling\r\nthe Porte to accept a scheme of reform under European supervision that\r\nshould secure fair government and the security of Turkey’s Christian\r\nsubjects. But the jealousy of the Powers stood in the way of any\r\ngenuine co-operation, while the policy of Turkey’s two most powerful\r\nneighbours was to destroy the Ottoman Empire and not to reform it; so\r\nthe British scheme was rejected; the measures that were taken by the\r\nPowers proved wholly inadequate; the anarchy in Macedonia ever grew\r\nworse; and it became evident that sooner or later foreign intervention\r\nof an effective and forcible character would be necessitated.\r\n\r\nNow the one essential part of the Young Turk programme is the\r\npreservation of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. Opportunists in\r\nthe rest of their policy, the Young Turks are determined that no more\r\nOttoman territory shall be placed under foreign domination. They feel\r\nthat foreign interference in Turkey’s internal affairs means loss of\r\nnational independence and the ultimate expulsion of the Turks from the\r\nEuropean side of the Bosphorus. They entertain the strongest objection\r\nto the attempted settlement of the racial disputes in Macedonia by\r\nforeign Powers, and the chief article of their faith is that, for\r\nTurkey to hold her own in the world, her reforms must come from\r\n_within_ and not from _without_. Therefore at this juncture, knowing\r\nthat they had the educated classes in Turkey in sympathy with them,\r\nand that oppression had made the masses discontented, these Turkish\r\npatriots in Geneva decided to create an organisation whose object it\r\nwould be to bring pressure to bear upon the Turkish Government, and\r\nmove the Sultan to sanction the much needed reforms. At this early\r\nstage they did not feel sufficiently strong to plan the deposition of\r\nthe monarch should he prove obdurate, but they resolved so to arrange\r\nmatters in Constantinople as to make it impossible, in the case of the\r\ndeath of that clever and masterly monarch, for his successor to rule on\r\nthe same despotic lines.\r\n\r\nThe head-quarters of the organisation was moved from Geneva to Paris,\r\nand it had its branches in London and other capitals. Little heed was\r\npaid to the Young Turks by the peoples in whose midst they lived, and\r\nmany regarded them as harmless dreamers. But the Sultan himself knew\r\nbetter; his Embassy in Paris was instructed to watch the organisation\r\nclosely, and spies were sent from Constantinople whose business it was\r\nto report directly to the Palace all they could discover concerning the\r\nmembers. In Turkey itself active methods of suppression were taken, and\r\nthe system of _espionage_ became ever more unbearable, with the result\r\nthat the enemies of the _régime_ increased in number, and Turkey’s best\r\nmen fled the country to swell the band of conspirators in Paris.\r\n\r\nNow that men can talk quite freely in Turkey, returning exiles tell\r\nstrange and romantic tales of their adventures in those dark days.\r\nFor a Turkish subject to leave Turkey without the permission of the\r\ninquisitorial Government was then a treasonable offence involving\r\noutlawry and the confiscation of property. As every outgoing steamer\r\nwas closely watched by the police, it was no easy matter to escape from\r\nConstantinople by sea, and to do so by land was still more difficult.\r\nOn several occasions distinguished Turks were assisted in their flight\r\nby their English friends. For example, with the connivance of one of\r\nour Consuls, a fugitive Pasha was concealed in the Consulate, was\r\ndisguised in a suit of slops such as sailormen wear, and when the\r\nopportunity arrived quietly walked away from the carefully watched\r\nConsulate in the company of an English merchant captain, satisfied\r\nthe questioning police spies on the quay, and boarded the British\r\nvessel that was to carry him to safety; for he had been entered on the\r\nship’s books as cook, and was provided with the necessary consular\r\ndocument that testified to his having signed articles in that capacity.\r\nOftentimes, too, some British steamer passing down the Bosphorus\r\nwould stop her engines and, under cover of the darkness, send off the\r\nfriendly boat that, by pre-arrangement, would take a party of fugitive\r\nTurks from a lonely beach, and so save them from the _oubliette_ or the\r\nstrangler’s cord.\r\n\r\nThe Palace employed terrorism in Turkey and corruption in Paris in its\r\nattempt to destroy the Young Turk association. By offers of rewards\r\nand high positions, some of the members were persuaded to desert the\r\ncause and to return to Turkey. Some were found base enough to serve\r\nas spies. Thus, one, whose name it is perhaps better not to mention,\r\ncontrived to work himself into a prominent position on the Paris\r\nCommittee, learnt its secrets, and returned to Constantinople to betray\r\nthem to the Sultan. But the organisation ever grew stronger under\r\npersecution, and patriotic Turks supplied the funds which enabled it\r\nto carry on its propaganda. The Paris Committee published a paper and\r\nnumerous tracts, which exposed the iniquities of the Hamidian _régime_\r\nand called for the deposition of the Sultan, and these were smuggled\r\ninto Turkey and were widely distributed and read, despite the vigilance\r\nof the ever-increasing army of spies. The agents of the Committee in\r\nConstantinople used to placard the city under cover of the night with\r\nrevolutionary appeals, and seditious placards threatening the life of\r\nthe Sultan were sometimes placed upon the walls of the Palace itself.\r\nAbdul Hamid, living in perpetual fear, redoubled his precautions.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 the Sultan, having been informed by his ambassador in\r\nParis that the Paris Committee was preparing a great Young Turkey\r\ndemonstration in Constantinople itself, was so anxious to intercept\r\nthe correspondence that was passing between Paris and the members\r\nof the Young Turkey party in his capital that he violated his\r\ninternational agreements by seizing and breaking open the European\r\nmail-bags that were addressed to the various foreign post-offices in\r\nConstantinople, and thereby provoked the Powers to threaten a joint\r\nnaval demonstration, which was only warded off by a humble apology and\r\nfurther solemn promises on Abdul Hamid’s part.\r\n\r\nIn Paris the “Ottoman Committee of Union and Progress,” to give the\r\nassociation the now world-famous name which it assumed a few years\r\nago, was ably directed by Ahmed Riza Bey, who, having worked with\r\ndevotion for the cause through eighteen years of exile, returned to\r\nTurkey after the proclamation of the Constitution last year, and is\r\nnow the President, or Speaker, of the Turkish Chamber of Deputies.\r\nThe Committee was also strengthened during the last few years of the\r\nHamidian _régime_ by the admission to it of several distinguished\r\nTurks of high rank, who fled from Constantinople to Paris so as to be\r\nable to assist the national movement from that safe vantage-ground.\r\nAmong these fugitives was the Sultan’s relative, Prince Sabah-ed-din,\r\nwho threw himself heart and soul into the revolutionary movement, and\r\nadvocated a policy more advanced and radical than that favoured by the\r\nlarge majority of the Young Turks, whose Liberalism is full-blooded\r\nToryism when compared to what passes for Liberalism in England in these\r\nlatter days. Prince Sabah-ed-din is an advanced home ruler, and he\r\nis the virtual leader of the “Liberal Union” party, which is working\r\nfor a degree of centralisation that is regarded as dangerous by most\r\nMussulmans, but is naturally pleasing to the Greeks.\r\n\r\nBut though these Turkish gentlemen, with their clever conversation and\r\ntheir charming manners, were welcomed in Paris _salons_ and London\r\ndrawing-rooms, few people in Europe realised that the Young Turkey\r\nmovement had the remotest chance of attaining its ends; for it was\r\na silent movement, and while the Greeks, Bulgarians, and Armenians\r\nvoiced their grievances with a persistence that gained for them a wide\r\nhearing and much sympathy, the patriotic Turks, unwilling to invoke\r\nthe help of foreigners, took no steps to make their aspirations known\r\nin Europe. Ahmed Riza did, indeed, come over to London in 1904, and,\r\nfor the first time in his life, addressed a meeting of Englishmen,\r\nbut it was not to crave sympathy for the Mussulman Turks whom he\r\nrepresented, but to express the sentiments of his party regarding\r\nforeign intervention in Turkey, whether it were that of a Government\r\nor of the English humanitarian committees. In the course of his speech\r\nAhmed Bey, while admitting the justice of a revolt against despotism,\r\ncondemned the European friends of Armenia and Macedonia for wrongfully\r\nand artificially inciting a rising, and so playing the part of the\r\nPan-Slavist agents, and he practically put it that by fomenting\r\ninsurrection among the Christian populations in Turkey they were more\r\nor less responsible for the massacres which followed. The meeting,\r\nto quote from the official report, “became extremely agitated, and\r\nmany interruptions were addressed to the speaker.” The speakers who\r\nfollowed had some unkind things to say concerning Ahmed Riza and the\r\nYoung Turks. Here is a quotation from the speech of an influential\r\nhumanitarian who was present: “I am not sorry that the gentleman has\r\nspoken, because it shows us how impossible it is to expect any reforms\r\nin Turkey from the Young Turkish party. They are only thinking of\r\nthemselves. The liberties of the Christians would be just as unsafe\r\nunder a Sultan with the sentiments of the gentleman who has just sat\r\ndown, as under the present Sultan.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet, even at that time, Ahmed Riza and his Mussulman associates\r\nwere planning a scheme which was intended to bring liberty, justice,\r\nand security to the oppressed Christian subjects of the Porte, and\r\nwas, moreover, destined to prove successful where all the diplomacy of\r\nthe Powers and the too often misdirected efforts of the humanitarians\r\nin Europe had signally failed. For the Young Turks, like their great\r\nforerunner, Midhat Pasha, realised that Turkey could only be saved from\r\ndisintegration by placing all her races and creeds on an equality, by\r\ngiving the same rights to all. They therefore set themselves to bring\r\nabout a co-operation of the various elements of the Turkish population,\r\nand to make common cause with the Armenian, Bulgarian, and other\r\nrevolutionary non-Mussulman committees in Paris.\r\n\r\nIt appeared, to those who heard of it, as being the most chimerical\r\nof schemes; for the Young Turks and their proposed allies had but one\r\naspiration in common—the overthrow of the Despotism. Their ideals\r\nseemed indeed to be irreconcilable. The Young Turks above all things\r\ndesired the maintenance of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire and a\r\nunion of her peoples that would make the Empire strong. On the other\r\nhand, the non-Mussulman revolutionaries cared nothing for the integrity\r\nof the Empire. For the most part they desired not to reform Turkey,\r\nbut to break her up. Neither did they seek union among themselves;\r\nfor the different Christian races hated each other, and cherished\r\nmutually incompatible ambitions. Thus, Bulgarians, Greeks, and Serbs\r\nin Macedonia dreamt of the formation of autonomous States, or of\r\nannexations to Bulgaria, Greece, and Servia, respectively. There\r\nwas to be found, too, in some of the non-Mussulman committees, a\r\nconsiderable leavening of anarchical and socialistic ideas with which\r\nthe conservative Turkish reformers could have no sympathy. Out of\r\nelements so incongruous, and in many respects antagonistic, it would\r\nseem impossible to effect any sort of co-operation.\r\n\r\nBut the Young Turks were terribly in earnest, and were patient and\r\npersuasive; they compelled the leaders of the non-Mussulman committees\r\nto listen to their arguments, and they sent delegates to their\r\nmeetings; but it was, of course, not for a long time that they could\r\ncome to an understanding with men who found it difficult to believe\r\nthat any form of Turkish rule could deal fairly with Christians and\r\nJews. At last, wonderful to say, the Young Turks in Paris, being honest\r\npatriots, succeeded in convincing the other groups of their sincerity\r\nwhen they put forward the full equality in the eyes of the law of all\r\nraces and creeds in Turkey as an essential portion of their programme.\r\n\r\nThe Armenian committees were the first to fall in line with the Young\r\nTurkey movement, and the union between them that was arranged in Paris,\r\nin 1903, has been faithfully observed by both parties. It will be\r\nremembered how the two races fraternised after the declaration of the\r\nConstitution, how the world was amazed by the spectacle of Armenian and\r\nMoslem clergymen walking arm in arm in processions, and how loyally the\r\nTurks and Armenians worked together during the Parliamentary elections.\r\nIt was, indeed, a natural alliance; there has never been real enmity\r\nbetween the two races until the present Sultan’s reign. The Armenian\r\nmassacres were not the work of Turks but of savage Kurds, instigated\r\nby the Palace Camarilla. “Few incidents in history are more touching,”\r\nwrites a Turkish subject in the _Nineteenth Century_, “than the visit\r\npaid by a large assembly of Turks (in August last) to the Armenian\r\ncemetery in Constantinople, in order to deposit floral tributes on the\r\ngraves of the victims of the massacre of 1894, and to have prayers\r\nrecited, by a priest of their own persuasion, over the butchered dead.”\r\n\r\nMoreover, there were few political difficulties in the way of an\r\nunderstanding between the Young Turks and the Armenian revolutionaries.\r\nThe problem was not like that of the Greeks and Slavs in Macedonia,\r\nwho had on the frontier independent nations of people of their own\r\nkin on whom to lean and to whom to look for protection and perchance\r\nannexation. For Armenia is now but a geographical expression, and\r\nancient Armenia has been partitioned between Turkey, Russia, and\r\nPersia. The Armenians in Turkish Armenia are vastly outnumbered by\r\nthe Moslem population; and the creation of an independent Armenian\r\nprincipality, desired by a section of the revolutionists, was obviously\r\nan impracticable scheme. The more sensible Armenians realised that\r\nthe only alternative for the rule of Turkey was that of Russia, and\r\nthe experience of their brethren across the border had proved to them\r\nthat, of the two, the rule of Turkey was to be preferred; for under it\r\nthey enjoyed a measure of racial autonomy and various privileges—much\r\nrestricted, it is true, under Abdul Hamid’s despotism—which\r\nthe Russian Government, ever bent on the Russianisation of the\r\nnationalities subject to it, would certainly have denied to them.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, the aim of the moderates among the Armenian\r\nmalcontents, while remaining under Ottoman rule, to secure the civil\r\nliberties and institutions calculated to guarantee their personal\r\nsafety, the security of their property, and the honour of their wives\r\nand daughters. Now the Young Turk programme promised them these things\r\nand more; so, realising that this great Mussulman movement was likely\r\nto meet with success, they decided to throw in their lot with Ahmed\r\nRiza and his brother revolutionaries.\r\n\r\nBut this union could not be accomplished until the Armenians had\r\nconsented to abandon the methods of their propaganda. They had for\r\nyears been appealing to the European Powers, through their Committees,\r\nto compel the Sultan to grant good government to his Christian subjects\r\nin Armenia in accordance with the solemn pledges which he had given to\r\nthe signatories of the Treaty of Berlin. But the Young Turks insisted\r\nthat there must be no appealing to foreign Powers for assistance, that\r\nthe Armenians henceforth would have to rely upon the support of their\r\nMussulman fellow-subjects alone, that they must now cease from such\r\nagitation as might invite further massacres, and await the outbreak of\r\nthe revolution that was to deliver all the races that were oppressed by\r\nthe Despotism.\r\n\r\nIt may have been noticed that from the date of this understanding, in\r\n1903, one heard very little about trouble in Armenia; the violence of\r\nthe Armenian propaganda was restrained by the leaders so that the Young\r\nTurk movement might not be embarrassed, and the attention of Europe\r\nwas now turned to the state of anarchy in Macedonia. The Young Turks\r\nalways worked in secret, but when policy demanded it they sometimes\r\ncame out into the open. Thus it was that Ahmed Riza went to London\r\nin 1904, shortly after the union between his party and the Armenian\r\nCommittees, and, in the speech from which I have quoted, protested at\r\na public meeting against the interference of English humanitarians in\r\nthe affairs of Armenia. He also seems to have influenced those who\r\ngoverned the policy of the Anglo-Armenian Association and to have won\r\ntheir confidence in his judgment, for it was at about this time that\r\nthe active propaganda of this organisation suddenly came to a stop.\r\n\r\nBut Ahmed Riza and his associates, though they were working diligently\r\nto prepare the ground for the coming revolution by sending emissaries\r\nto inoculate the young army officers in Turkey with their views, and\r\nthe Moslem clergy with interpretations of the Koran that breathed\r\nthe spirit of reform and tolerance, kept their doings secret even\r\nfrom their friends. The revolution, so carefully planned, came as a\r\ncomplete surprise even to those Englishmen who had come in touch with\r\nthe Turkish reformers in Paris and sympathised with the aspirations of\r\nthose intensely patriotic men who shunned politics, declined interviews\r\nwith the press, and lived most frugal lives, while they devoted\r\nthemselves with single-minded zeal to the cause. I may mention that\r\nsince 1904 the officials of the Eastern Questions Association (which,\r\nI believe, has always held the view that a strong and independent\r\nTurkey is an essential factor in the polity of nations) have been on\r\nfriendly terms with Ahmed Riza Bey, visited him in Paris, become strong\r\nsupporters of the Young Turk party, and have vigorously denounced the\r\ncrooked policy of Russia and Austria in Macedonia.\r\n\r\nThe Young Turks thus came to an understanding with the Armenians, and\r\nlater on it was arranged between them that when the time was ripe,\r\nand the Committee gave the word for the Mussulman revolt in Turkey,\r\nthe Armenians should also rise; for it was realised that the Sultan\r\nwould yield to nothing but force, and that only by means of an armed\r\nrebellion, and that possibly a very bloody one, could the liberators of\r\nTurkey effect their end.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Young Turks set themselves to win over to their cause the\r\nother non-Mussulman revolutionary Committees. With the Jews, as with\r\nthe Armenians, they had relatively little difficulty, for the Jews\r\nwere a people without a land, and therefore could entertain no schemes\r\nof national independence; their hope and interests lay in the good\r\ngovernment of the Ottoman Empire. But with the Bulgarians, Greeks, and\r\nSerbs of Macedonia, whose very last idea it was to become patriotic\r\nOttomans, the Young Turks found the work of persuasion attended with\r\nalmost insuperable difficulties.\r\n\r\nTo these revolutionaries other forms of argument had to be applied.\r\nIt was pointed out to them that, unassisted from outside, they could\r\nnot hope to conquer their independence with the sword from the armies\r\nof the Sultan; that the mutually jealous Great Powers, if they did\r\nintervene in Macedonia, were not in the least likely to favour the\r\npolitical aspirations of the Christian populations; that to appeal\r\nto foreign intervention was a very dangerous thing; and that the\r\nannexation of the greater part of Macedonia to Austria-Hungary—in\r\ndetestation of which Power all these Balkan races are united—might\r\nbe the result of the state of anarchy in that region for which the\r\nrevolutionary bands were responsible; in short, that it would be to\r\nthe advantage of the Macedonian Christians to abandon their ideas of\r\nseparation from the Ottoman Empire and to join cause with the Young\r\nTurks, whose aim it was to hold the Empire together and to give equal\r\nrights to all its peoples.\r\n\r\nWonderful to say, the Macedonian Committees in Paris at last allowed\r\nthemselves to be persuaded, and threw in their lot with the Young\r\nTurks, half-heartedly, perhaps, at first, and with mental reservations.\r\nThey realised that they could hope for little help from Europe, and\r\nwere willing to work with the Young Turks in upsetting the Hamidian\r\n_régime_. After a successful revolution something might turn up that\r\nwould enable them to gain the national independence that they still\r\nhad at heart; and even if that hope was destroyed, they would be able,\r\nhaving supported the Young Turks, to claim the equal rights which\r\nthese had promised to them. But the conflict of interests that severed\r\nthe various groups, and the anarchical principles that some of the\r\nrevolutionary leaders professed, made the reconciliation of all these\r\ndiscordant elements a matter of great difficulty. The Congress held in\r\nParis, in 1902, had for its chief result the accentuation of schism;\r\nit was not till 1907 that the various Committees were able at last to\r\narrange a programme that was acceptable to all; and by that time the\r\nYoung Turks had established their secret society in Macedonia and had\r\ngained the allegiance of a considerable portion of that formidable\r\nTurkish army without whose cooperation, as the Christians in Macedonia\r\nknew well, no revolution had a chance of success.\r\n\r\nSo in December, 1907, a Congress of the Turkish revolutionaries met\r\nin Paris, at which were represented the Ottoman Committee of Union\r\nand Progress, the Armenian, Bulgarian, Jewish, Arab, Albanian, and\r\nother Committees; and the delegates all agreed to accept the following\r\nprinciples: The deposition of the Sultan Abdul Hamid. The maintenance\r\nof the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. Absolute equality in the eyes\r\nof the law of the various races and religions. The establishment of\r\nParliamentary institutions on the lines of Midhat Pasha’s Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe “Ottoman Committee of Union and Progress,” as representing the\r\ndominant race and the fighting forces of the revolution, naturally now\r\ntook the lead, and its members, of whom but a few were non-Mussulmans,\r\nbecame the organisers of the revolt and mandatories of the other\r\nCommittees. It may be pointed out here that the resolutions of the\r\nCongress had no effect in pacifying Macedonia, where, indeed, the\r\ncondition of affairs was ever becoming worse; for Greece and Bulgaria,\r\nstill looking forward to the disruption of Turkey, were pouring into\r\nMacedonia their armed bands to “peg out claims” in the Greek and\r\nBulgarian interest; and throughout all that region violence, murder,\r\nand rapine prevailed. Of no more effect were the efforts of the Great\r\nPowers, which, in 1907, issued a categorical declaration that no\r\nMacedonian race would be permitted to draw any territorial advantage\r\nfrom the action of its bands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n_DISCONTENT IN THE ARMY_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1906 the Ottoman Committee of Union and Progress, considering that\r\nthe time had come to transfer their organisation to the soil of Turkey\r\nitself, and there make the final preparations for their attack on the\r\nDespotism, selected Macedonia as the scene of their initial operations.\r\n\r\nThere were good reasons for choosing this portion of Turkey as their\r\nstrategic base. In the first place, it was here that the forces were\r\nchiefly at work which were threatening the speedy dissolution of the\r\nOttoman Empire, and the Young Turks realised that unless they quickly\r\ncame to the rescue it would be too late, and Macedonia would be lost.\r\nThe terrible condition of the country, overrun as it was by murderous\r\nbands of political brigands supported by Turkey’s enemies, had already\r\ndrawn an interference in the internal affairs of Macedonia on the part\r\nof the Great Powers that was deeply humiliating to every patriotic\r\nTurk. The Powers had compelled the Sultan, by threat of force, to\r\nconsent to the supervision of the civil administration of Macedonia\r\nby an international financial commission, and to the formation of\r\nan international _gendarmerie_ trained and commanded by foreign\r\nofficers—of whom, by the way, the English officers have undoubtedly\r\nbeen the most successful, as they are more in sympathy than the others\r\nwith the nature of the Turkish soldier. But the patriotic Turks, though\r\nthey often entertained personal affection for the European officers\r\nwho were thus thrust upon them, loathed this foreign interference, and\r\nnourished a bitter resentment against the Hamidian _régime_, whose\r\ninept rule had brought this indignity upon Turkey and made the world\r\nregard the Ottomans as a fallen people no longer capable of managing\r\ntheir own affairs.\r\n\r\nThere was one feature of this foreign intervention which was especially\r\ndisagreeable and alarming to the Young Turks. The reforms proposed by\r\nEngland, a disinterested country, had been rejected by the Powers, and\r\na mandate had been given to Russia and Austria—regarded by the Turks\r\nas their most treacherous enemies—to introduce their own programme of\r\nreform (the Murzteg programme) into Macedonia. The Turks maintained,\r\nas, too, did independent observers, that these two Powers of a\r\npurpose made this programme a wholly ineffective one, and that their\r\nrepresentatives were so working as to foment disorder and strife among\r\nthe Christian populations in order to forward the schemes for the\r\ndismemberment of European Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe signs of this foreign intervention everywhere around them served\r\nas object lessons to the people in Macedonia, whether educated men\r\nor peasants, civilians or soldiers, and they realised that, unless\r\nthe methods of Turkish government improved, the foreign hold on the\r\ncountry would be ever tightened until its independence was destroyed.\r\nThus there spread throughout Macedonia a profound discontent with\r\nthe existing order of things, that prepared the ground for the great\r\nconspiracy.\r\n\r\nTo win over the Army to their side was of course the first object of\r\nthe Young Turks, and therefore Macedonia was well chosen as the field\r\nof the early operations, inasmuch as the troops there were in a more\r\ndisaffected condition than those in any other part of the Empire, and\r\nwere ripe for revolt. For years these troops—ill clad, ill fed, and\r\nrarely paid—had been engaged in a desultory guerilla war against the\r\nbands of the Christian insurgents—a form of police work that brought\r\nno glory and was uncongenial to soldiers, while, by scattering them\r\nover the country in small sections, it did away with the cohesion and\r\n_esprit de corps_ essential to an army. Their discontent was also\r\naroused by seeing by the side of them their brothers of the smart\r\ninternational _gendarmerie_, men with military pride and bearing, well\r\ndisciplined and (for the Powers saw to this) well clothed and fed,\r\nand regularly paid. It hurt the self-respect of both officers and men\r\nin the regular army to contrast the condition of these men with that\r\nof their ragged selves, for which, as they well knew, the corrupt\r\nadministration of the Palace gang was to blame.\r\n\r\nOf the intolerable military spy system and the other causes of\r\ndisaffection among the officers of the Ottoman forces I have already\r\nspoken. The young officers of the Macedonia army, men of education\r\nand open-minded, who had passed through the military academies and\r\nhad received instruction from foreign teachers, had exceptional\r\nopportunities in Macedonia for observing how an infamous rule was\r\nhurrying their country to its ruin, and therefore their sympathies\r\nnaturally inclined towards the Young Turkey movement. Moreover,\r\nspecial grievances of their own aggravated their detestation of the\r\nHamidian _régime_; the spy system was more searching and oppressive\r\nthen elsewhere in this suspected portion of the Ottoman army, and it\r\nhad become the habit of the Palace—galling to those who suffered under\r\nit—to send from the capital sleek Court favourites, with nothing of the\r\nsoldier in them, to assume commands over the heads of fine officers who\r\nhad taken a distinguished part in Turkey’s wars, and had been fighting\r\nthe insurgent bands for years in the Macedonian mountains, but had\r\nnever obtained the promotion that was their due.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it favoured the plan of the revolutionaries that this vantage\r\nground of Macedonia was at a safe distance from the capital—from\r\nthe Palace with its myriad eyes and its regiments of well-fed,\r\nwell-equipped, well-paid troops who could be counted upon to remain\r\nloyal to the despotism.\r\n\r\nSo far as the Mussulman population and the army were concerned,\r\nMacedonia was therefore ripe for rebellion, and the Christian\r\npeasantry, weary of the slaughter and devastation which the bands\r\nfor years had been inflicting on the wretched country, were ready\r\nto welcome any new order of things that promised to bring peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nTo understand the operations of the secret society that organised\r\nthe insurrection in Macedonia, it is necessary to bear in mind the\r\ncondition of the country at that time. The Christian peasantry in\r\nMacedonia had suffered terribly from the pitiless methods employed\r\nby the Turks in suppressing any signs of insurrection, but during\r\nthe latter years of the Hamidian _régime_ they had to suffer even\r\nworse things, in consequence of the cruel internecine war which they\r\nwaged among themselves. The various races that make up the population\r\nof Macedonia had for long been carrying on their several national\r\npropaganda. The three independent States on Macedonia’s borders,\r\nGreece, Bulgaria, and Servia, were working with the Greeks, Bulgarians,\r\nand Serbs under Turkish rule, with a view to territorial expansion\r\nin this region, so soon as the dissolution of the Turkish Empire, to\r\nwhich they looked forward with confidence, should come to pass. But in\r\nMacedonia there are no extensive districts exclusively inhabited by\r\nGreeks, Bulgarians, or Serbs. The different races are intermingled,\r\nand it is not unusual to find Mussulman Turks and Christians of each\r\nof three races living side by side in the same village. Consequently,\r\nas each of the three States above mentioned aspired to the reversion\r\nof all territory occupied by people of its own race, there was nearly\r\neverywhere an overlapping of claims; and it became the policy of each\r\nState to gain influence in a coveted district and there secure the\r\nnumerical superiority of people of its own race, so as to be able to\r\nestablish a strong title to possession when the Powers should undertake\r\nthe dismemberment of Turkey.\r\n\r\nThis racial rivalry was embittered by religious fanaticism. Formerly\r\nthe Greek Orthodox Church exercised an exclusive influence over the\r\nBulgarian as well as Greek population of Macedonia, and all recognised\r\nthe Patriarch as their spiritual head. The Bulgarians resented the\r\ntyrannical ecclesiastical ascendency of the Greeks, and a schism arose\r\nwhich was deliberately widened by the Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz, who conceded\r\nto the Bulgarians the right to separate from the Greek Church and\r\nappoint an Exarch of their own. The Patriarch excommunicated the first\r\nExarch and all who gave their allegiance to him, and since then there\r\nhas been bitter hatred between the Orthodox and the schismatics. Of the\r\nBulgarians in Macedonia, some have remained faithful to the Orthodox\r\nChurch, while the majority acknowledge the spiritual headship of the\r\nExarch. Now in Turkey populations are reckoned according to creed\r\nand not race, and in the census returns a Bulgarian who was a member\r\nof the Orthodox Greek Church would appear as a Greek. Therefore, for\r\npolitical, as well as religious, reasons the Greeks and Bulgarians\r\nstrove hard to snatch from each other the control of the schools and\r\nchurches in any district where there was a Bulgarian population, and\r\nemployed violence and every form of persecution to secure converts.\r\n\r\nIn Greece, Bulgaria, and Servia, armed bands were equipped and sent\r\ninto Macedonia to forward the rival interests of these land-lustful\r\nStates. Bulgarian bands burnt Greek villages and Greek bands\r\nthose of the Bulgarians. The seizure of each other’s churches and\r\necclesiastical property, and the murder of priests, became features\r\nof the propaganda. In the zeal to bring about the preponderance of\r\nthis or that race the armed ruffians murdered women and children,\r\nand all the barbarities which aroused the indignation of Europe when\r\nTurkish irregulars were the guilty, were now committed against each\r\nother by the Christian _protégés_ of our humanitarians. With fire and\r\nsword the several propaganda were spread through the country. The\r\nGreeks boycotted the Bulgarians in the towns, and by various methods\r\nof persecution endeavoured to drive Bulgarians from coveted districts\r\non the sea-coast. The Greek bishops and clergy worked with fanatical\r\nactivity; not only did they forbid their co-religionists to give\r\nemployment to Bulgarians, but they were largely responsible for the\r\natrocities committed by the Greek bands, and went so far as to draw up\r\nproscription lists of Bulgarian schismatics who had to be assassinated;\r\nbut the Bulgarians often had their revenge, as when, about a year ago,\r\nthey dragged a Greek clergyman out of his church and burnt him alive.\r\n\r\nOut of the many stories which one could tell, here is one which will\r\nserve as an example of the methods of the bands. On November 26, 1907,\r\na Greek band of over sixty men surrounded the village of Zelenitchi,\r\nwhile a party broke into the house of the Bulgarian, Stoyan Gateff,\r\nwhere a marriage was being celebrated, killed thirteen men, women, and\r\nchildren, and wounded others.\r\n\r\nTo add to all this orgie of bloodshed, robbery, and violence, came the\r\nformation of bands of Mussulman Turks, endowed with the bravery of\r\ntheir race, who, while protecting the Turkish peasantry against the\r\nChristians, pillaged and burnt the villages of the latter, and did\r\ntheir share of the killing; while the bodies of half-famished, unpaid\r\nTurkish troops who were sent to search for concealed arms over the\r\ncountryside naturally lived on the wretched Christian peasants, and\r\nhelped themselves to all they needed.\r\n\r\nBetween the Greeks and Bulgarians there was never a truce save in\r\nwinter, when the snow lay deep upon the Balkans, but sometimes the\r\nSerb would join the Greek bands in their attacks on the Bulgarians.\r\nThus organised brigandage terrorised the countryside, and the bands,\r\nwhen they ran short of money or supplies, did not hesitate to rob even\r\nthe people of their own kin, whose cause they were espousing, levying\r\nblackmail upon them, and burning their villages if demands were not\r\nsatisfied. It is not to be wondered at that a large proportion of the\r\nChristian population found the succour of their ferocious brethren\r\nsomewhat irksome, and were ready to welcome the pacific programme of\r\nthe Young Turks. It will be remembered that when Bulgaria declared\r\nher independence last year the Bulgarian peasants in Macedonia held\r\nmeetings at which they denounced the Principality and sent a memorial\r\nto Prince Ferdinand to warn him that they would hold him responsible\r\nfor whatever evil might now befall them, as the result of his action.\r\n\r\nOf all these Christian propagandists the Bulgarians aroused most\r\nsympathy in Europe; for they are a brave and straightforward people.\r\nThey had good reason to hate the Greeks, who had always persecuted\r\nthem. When, in 1903, the Bulgarian exarchists in Macedonia, with their\r\nhundreds of small armed bands, carried on a gallant but hopeless\r\nguerilla war against the Turkish regular troops, the Greek Macedonians\r\nremained neutral, but worked against their fellow-Christians after\r\na fashion characteristically Hellenic; they assisted the Turks\r\nby betraying and denouncing to them the Bulgarian rebels; for in\r\ntheir zeal to forward their ultimate political designs they were\r\nnot ill pleased to witness the extermination by the Turks of their\r\nfellow-Christians who repudiated the Patriarch and refused to become\r\nHellenised. It was not until 1904 that Greek bands, led by officers\r\nof the Greek regular army, crossed the frontier into Macedonia to\r\nwage war not only against the propaganda of the Bulgarian exarchists,\r\nbut also that of the Wallach inhabitants, who desired to throw off\r\nthe tyrannical supremacy of the Greek Patriarch and have an Exarch of\r\ntheir own, as the Bulgarians had, with their own schools and churches\r\nin which their national language could be used. The Sultan, who was\r\never playing one Christian sect off against another, and made no real\r\neffort to stop the fratricidal strife that served his designs, now gave\r\nhis encouragement to the Wallach propaganda, for this did not threaten\r\nthe integrity of his Empire as did the propaganda of the Greeks and\r\nSerbs, there being no question of annexation of any Wallach districts\r\nof Macedonia to the distant kingdom of the Wallachs’ kin, Roumania.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians proved themselves the braver men in this racial\r\nstruggle; but the Greek bands were the strongest in numbers and were\r\nalso the best equipped, for they were always kept well supplied with\r\nammunition and food by the rich merchants in Athens. The Greek bands\r\nchiefly distinguished themselves by attacking unprotected villages and\r\nslaughtering unarmed peasants; half-a-dozen brave Turkish _gendarmes_\r\nhave on occasion sufficed to rout the largest of these bands. I\r\nneed not say that the unfortunate Turkish peasants, being regarded\r\nas enemies by all parties, suffered severely at the hands of the\r\npropagandists.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the country ever got worse. In 1907 there were one\r\nhundred and thirty-three conflicts between Turkish troops and Greek\r\nand Bulgarian bands, and a large but unrecorded number of fights\r\nbetween rival bands: Greek and Wallach; Greek and Bulgarian; Bulgarian\r\nand Serb; and Albanian and Serb. The bands used to come down to the\r\nplains and carry off the crops outside Salonica itself. The Greek\r\nCommittee sent a manifesto to the villages round Salonica ordering the\r\nvillagers, under pain of death, to become converts to Orthodoxy and\r\nto accept the Patriarch, and have themselves inscribed as Greeks upon\r\nthe census papers. Shortly before the Sultan’s proclamation of the\r\nConstitution the artillery of the Salonica garrison had to shell the\r\nreed-covered swamps in the vicinity of the city to drive out the bands\r\nthat had found shelter there.\r\n\r\nIt was in the city of Salonica that the Ottoman Committee of Union and\r\nProgress decided to establish the headquarters of the secret society\r\nthat was to prepare the outbreak of rebellion in Macedonia, a city\r\nwhich, as being the cradle of their liberties, has already come to\r\nbe regarded as a sort of holy place by patriotic Turks. It is a city\r\nworthy to be the scene of the initiation of one of the world’s great\r\nmovements. The splendid seaport, on the acquisition of which Austria\r\nhad set her heart, impresses every visitor with a sense of a peculiar\r\nnobility with which it is invested by its aspect, situation, and\r\nhistory. Stately and beautiful is the approach to it from the sea as\r\none sails up the fifty-mile broad Gulf of Salonica; on the right the\r\nundulating land of Cassandra, with grassy, tree-studded shores, and\r\nwindmills on the skyline testifying to the productiveness of the fields\r\nbeyond; on the left the mountain ranges of Thessaly; with peaks whose\r\nnames are known to every school-boy—Pelion to the south, then Ossa,\r\nand, near the head of the Gulf, a noble mountain mass towering over the\r\nlesser heights, with snowy summits ten thousand feet above the sea,\r\nMount Olympus itself, the abode of the old gods.\r\n\r\nFrom the busy quay of Salonica one looks across the blue water at the\r\nsnows of Olympus and a wonderful far panorama of hills and dales of\r\nclassic Greece; and Salonica itself is a fair city to look upon from\r\nthe sea, with its gleaming white houses and minarets, and dark groves\r\nof cypress sloping up to the ancient castle and fortifications. I need\r\nnot recall here the great part which Thessalonica played in the old\r\ndays when Persians, Athenians, Macedonians, Romans, Normans of Sicily,\r\nand Saracens in succession conquered and held the famous port, the\r\nprincipal city between Rome and the East; its vicissitudes and many\r\nbloody sieges. Old Thessalonica, with its Greek, Roman, and Byzantine\r\nruins, relics of “sad, half-forgotten things and battles long ago,”\r\nthe thronged city where St. Paul preached and worked with his hands\r\namong the Macedonian artisans, as the modern Salonica has once again\r\ncome to the forefront in the shaping of the world’s history, and its\r\ncitizens walk proudly because here dawned the liberty of the Ottomans,\r\nwith its inspiring hopes. There is something about the atmosphere of\r\nSalonica which makes it seem a fitting place to be the birthplace of\r\na great movement. One feels freer on its broad quay and in its clean,\r\nwell-paved streets than in the narrow, ever muddy lanes which imprison\r\none in Constantinople. The climate for the greater part of the year\r\nis most exhilarating, and the inhabitants of this white city, “ever\r\ndelicately walking through most pellucid air,” seem more vivacious\r\nand brisk, and are said to be more enlightened, more industrious, and\r\nshrewder than those of the capital.\r\n\r\nEven under the tyranny and corruption of the old _régime_ things were\r\nfairly well ordered in Salonica, and the municipal authorities did\r\nsome good work, as the appearance of the streets shows, though they\r\ndid appropriate, in the shape of irregular salaries, one-half of the\r\nrates. Salonica, too, enjoyed a measure of liberty, even in those dark\r\ndays, and men could do here many things which would have ensured their\r\nprompt punishment in Constantinople. For example, though meetings of\r\nany description were banned by the Palace, and a man could not invite\r\ntwo or three friends to dine with him in his house without permission,\r\nand though to be found guilty of being a Freemason was to incur the\r\ndeath penalty, Freemasonry (French, Grand Orient, Spanish, and Italian)\r\nflourished in Salonica; there were five Masonic Lodges in the town\r\nthroughout the long years of despotism, though of course the Lodges had\r\nno fixed habitations, and the Masons used to meet in whatever house or\r\nperhaps lonely spot in the open country was at any time deemed to be\r\nthe safest place.\r\n\r\nIn Salonica, with its teeming population of Turks, Greeks, Jews,\r\nAlbanians, Bulgarians, and Levantines of many mixed races, speaking\r\ndivers tongues, it is easy for men to assume disguises and difficult\r\nfor spies to trace conspiracies. In no city does one come across a\r\ngreater variety of race and picturesque costume than in these busy\r\nbazaars and streets—the Jews (who here number fifty thousand) who look\r\nas if they had stepped straight out of the Venice of Shakespeare’s\r\ntime, the men in gabardines, the women in robes such as were worn by\r\nthe ancestors of these people when they were driven out of Spain by\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, still speaking among themselves a strange\r\nSpanish dialect—swaggering Albanians in their picturesque becoming\r\nnational costume of which Byron sang—burly Bulgarian peasants—priests\r\nof all denominations, including Russian monks of neighbouring Mount\r\nAthos, emissaries from that holy promontory on which for one thousand\r\nyears no woman or even animal of the female sex has been allowed to set\r\nfoot, where monks in their thousands dwell in ascetic retirement in\r\nmonasteries perched like the lamaseries of Tibet among the mountains,\r\nwhile in the wildest and most inaccessible spots anchorites have their\r\nhermitages and live in complete solitude after the manner of their\r\npredecessor, St. Anthony.\r\n\r\nThe fact that it was possible in this crowded city to escape\r\nobservation and to organise secret societies made Salonica the natural\r\ncentre of the Young Turk movement in Macedonia. Secret political\r\norganisation already existed there, and the Internal Organisations of\r\nthe Bulgarian revolutionary party had had its head-quarters there since\r\nabout 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n_THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE_\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, in the summer of 1906, the Young Turk movement crystallised into\r\na secret society in Salonica, so well organised that it effected its\r\npurpose despite the universal _espionage_, its work, of course, being\r\nfacilitated by the fact that in every part of the Empire the system of\r\nadministration had become so hateful to the people that, outside the\r\nhorde of spies, and those who prospered under the methods of the old\r\n_régime_, few men could be found so base as to betray the leaders to\r\nthe authorities. It will make a wonderful story, when it is fully told,\r\nthat of these men working in secret and danger, many losing their lives\r\nand still more their fortunes, but spreading their propaganda, becoming\r\never stronger, until at last, having secured the support of a great\r\narmy and a powerful Church, they won liberty for Turkey by the almost\r\nbloodless revolution that has taken all Europe by surprise.\r\n\r\nThis secret society was to a large extent modelled on Freemasonry,\r\nand a considerable proportion of the early associates (Mussulmans for\r\nthe most part, with some Jews) were members of the Masonic Lodges in\r\nSalonica. The machinery of Freemasonry, however, was not directly\r\nemployed to further the propaganda, and the Lodges took no official\r\ncognizance of this political movement. It would obviously have been\r\ntoo dangerous to discuss such a conspiracy as this one at Masonic\r\ngatherings, where the treason of one man could destroy so many. The\r\nmethods of the Italian secret societies, where a member is introduced\r\nto two or three of the affiliated only and so cannot betray more than\r\nthis number, were therefore adopted by those who framed the regulations\r\nof the new organisation. But still Freemasonry was a great help to the\r\ncause; for a member of the secret society who happened to be also a\r\nMason, while he was seeking, as was his duty, to gain fresh initiates,\r\ncould more readily approach a brother Mason than any other man with\r\nthis purpose, knowing that the very fact of being a Mason indicated a\r\nnatural inclination to be in sympathy with the aims of the Young Turks,\r\nand feeling also that he could rely upon the secrecy and fidelity of\r\none of the fraternity.\r\n\r\nThe secret society was first known as the “Committee of Liberty,”\r\nbut shortly after its creation it was amalgamated with the “Ottoman\r\nCommittee of Union and Progress” in Paris, and became the working\r\ncentre of that organisation. From that time the “Ottoman Committee of\r\nUnion and Progress” had its secret headquarters in Salonica, while\r\nAhmed Riza and his associates remained in Paris to form an important\r\nbranch committee that was able to further the cause in many ways from\r\nthe secure sanctuary of a foreign capital. Thus it was in Paris, in\r\n1907, more than a year after the establishment of the Committee’s\r\nhead-quarters in Salonica, that, at the instance of the Paris branch,\r\nthere was held that Congress of Turkish revolutionaries of which I have\r\nalready spoken, at which Committees representing the various races of\r\nthe Empire agreed to co-operate with the Young Turks.\r\n\r\nThe secret central committee, therefore, held its meetings in Salonica,\r\nand kept up a constant communication with branch committees in Scutari\r\nof Albania, Monastir, Janina, and other towns, and later it had its\r\nsmall local committee in nearly every village of Macedonia and Albania.\r\nBefore the outbreak of the revolution it had established its branch\r\ncommittees in all the important towns of Asiatic Turkey. Of those who\r\ncomposed the Salonica Committee I have met many. They were all men from\r\nwhat we should term the upper and middle classes—young officers in\r\nthe army who had passed through the military schools and had profited\r\nby the splendid system of instruction introduced by the genius of\r\nBaron von der Goltz—the one good thing for which Turkey has reason to\r\nbe grateful to Germany; young civil servants of the different State\r\ndepartments; land-owning Macedonian beys; professors; lawyers; doctors\r\nand some of the _ulemas_. Of officers of high rank and of the heads of\r\nthe Civil Service there were none; for most of these were creatures\r\nof the Palace, and such as may have had sympathy with the Young Turk\r\ncause were, in consequence of their position, too closely watched by\r\nthe Yildiz spies to take an active part in the movement. All the\r\nmen—for the most part men under middle age—who became members of the\r\nsecret committee were distinguished for their intense and unselfish\r\npatriotism, men who commanded the respect and admiration of every\r\nforeigner who has come in contact with them. This revolution did not\r\ncome from below, from debased city mobs or ignorant peasantry, but from\r\nabove, from all that is best in Turkey. The self-seeking demagogue\r\nhad no part in this revolution. These men, who devoted their lives\r\nto overthrowing the Despotism, represented the honest and patriotic\r\nOttoman gentry, men who placed country above self-interest, the natural\r\nleaders of the people, belonging to a dominant race which knows how to\r\ncommand men—a more useful quality than much administrative knowledge.\r\n\r\nSome of the principal members of the Committee of Union and Progress\r\nin Salonica spoke to me when I was in that city, in November last,\r\nwithout reserve—as they will do to an Englishman who has gained their\r\nconfidence—concerning their early secret organisation; for now that the\r\ndanger is almost over they are quite willing that the methods which\r\nthey were compelled to adopt before the granting of the Constitution\r\nshould be made known. To understand with sympathy what I am about to\r\ndescribe, and recognise how fully justified were such assassinations\r\nas were ordered by the Committee, one must bear in mind the terrible\r\nnature of the late _régime_; how thousands of spies were scattered\r\nover the country whose business it was to denounce suspects to the\r\nPalace; how many of the best men in the country suddenly disappeared\r\nfrom their wives and families, never to return; how torture and death\r\nwere the penalties for those who sought to set bounds to the Sultan’s\r\nabsolutism.\r\n\r\nThe machinery of this wonderful secret Society, which, throughout\r\nthe three years preceding the granting of the Constitution, did its\r\ndangerous work so well, so unpityingly when the occasion demanded, but\r\nalways so justly, has been described to me as follows by some of its\r\nbest known founders:\r\n\r\nThe propagandist work of a member of the Society was two-fold. First,\r\nhe had to gain adherents to the cause among all classes of the Turkish\r\npopulation by using arguments, explanations, and exhortations.\r\nSecondly, he had to persuade certain carefully selected persons from\r\namong his relations and more intimate friends to become affiliated to\r\nthe Society, and this he had to do with the greatest caution. Thus, a\r\nmember of the Society, whom we will call A, would approach his friend\r\nand, perhaps, brother Mason, B, whom he knew to be a righteous and\r\npatriotic man, to whom the methods of the Despotism must necessarily\r\nbe detestable, and carefully sound him. Having satisfied himself that\r\nhis friend was inspired by a true zeal, and was prepared to make great\r\nsacrifices for his country’s salvation, A would say to B, “I have a\r\nsecret, a great mystery, which I should like to confide to you. Will\r\nyou swear never to divulge what I am about to say to any one?” On B’s\r\ntaking the required oath, A would explain to him that there existed a\r\npowerful secret society of which he himself was a member, whose aim was\r\nthe destruction of the existing system of government, and would then\r\nask whether as a patriot he would like to join the brotherhood, warning\r\nhim at the same time of the serious step he was about to take and of\r\nthe great dangers which he would have to face.\r\n\r\nOn B’s replying in the affirmative, A would leave him, and a few days\r\nlater two messengers would come to B and call upon him in the name of\r\nhis friend A to follow them. The messengers would lead B to a lonely\r\nplace, there blindfold him, and then take him to some retired house\r\nor recess in the forest which had been selected as the place of his\r\ninitiation. Here he would be ordered to stand, the bandage still across\r\nhis eyes, while he was addressed by two or more eloquent speakers,\r\nwho would draw a vivid picture of the evils of the tyranny, of the\r\ncertain destruction of the Ottoman Empire to which ill government\r\nwas leading, of the great suffering which the Palace _espionage_ had\r\ninflicted on so many of their friends and relations, and would show\r\nin burning words that it was the duty of every good Ottoman to do his\r\nutmost by all possible methods to assist in the liberation of Turkey.\r\nTurks often possess great oratorical powers, and I am assured that in\r\nnearly every instance the candidate would be moved to tears by these\r\nimpressive exhortations. The candidate would be sworn to secrecy and\r\nfidelity and unquestioning obedience to the orders of the Committee,\r\non the Koran and on the sword, and he would then be solemnly declared\r\nto be affiliated to the secret Society. In the rare cases in which the\r\ncandidate was not a Mussulman the oath would of course be administered\r\nin some other way.\r\n\r\nThe bandage would then be removed from his eyes and lie would find\r\nhimself in the presence of five masked men wearing long cloaks. One\r\nof these would again address the initiate. First, he would explain to\r\nhim that precautions to secure secrecy and to make treason difficult\r\nwere indispensable to the very existence of the Society, for the spies\r\nof the Palace were ever around it, while it was possible that some\r\nwere even within its circle; that therefore it was expedient that the\r\ninitiates should be as little known to each other as possible; and that\r\nit was on this account that those who now addressed him were masked,\r\nand, moreover, persons whom he had never previously met, so that it\r\nmight be impossible for him to identify them by their voices. The\r\nspeaker would then proceed to explain to the initiate his duties and\r\nobligations. He would remind him that the Committee condemned to death\r\nnot only traitors but those who disobeyed its orders, and impress upon\r\nhim that by the oath he had taken in the name of God and Mohammed his\r\nlife would have to be devoted to the cause until Turkey was freed,\r\nthat he belonged body and soul to the Society, and would have to go to\r\nwhatever part of the world he was sent, and do whatever the Society\r\nbade him, even were it to kill his own brother. At the conclusion of\r\nthis ritual B would again be blindfolded and be led away by the two\r\nmessengers.\r\n\r\nFor some weeks or months after this initiation B would undergo a\r\nterm of probation; orders would come to him by secret channels and\r\nhe would obey them, but he would see no member of the Society. His\r\nintroducer, A, was responsible for his fidelity, and should B so act\r\nas to be condemned to death by the Society, it would be the hand of\r\nhis friend A which would have to slay him. At last, B having proved\r\nhimself worthy, the messengers would again summon him to a meeting of\r\nthe secret Committee, and after a ceremony somewhat similar to the\r\nfirst, he would be affiliated to one of the companies into which the\r\nSociety was divided, each company containing about one hundred and\r\nfifty members. But B would be made known to four men of his company and\r\nno more, for it was in circles of five only that the initiates used to\r\nmeet. So it was impossible for any false member to betray more than\r\nfive comrades—the four of his own circle and his introducer. In each\r\ncircle of five one member served as a link with the other circles of\r\nthe company; while each company had certain members who were the links\r\nbetween it and the other companies and with the Central Committee.\r\n\r\nOf this secret Central Committee I can say little; for though now, the\r\nDespotism having been destroyed, the members of the Committee of Union\r\nand Progress have come out in the open, and every one knows who they\r\nare, they still appoint a secret central organisation, the names of\r\nwhose members no man will tell you and few men know. But one is assured\r\nthat this Committee has no president and no leaders, that all are\r\nequal in it, and that a new chairman is elected at each meeting; for\r\nindividual ambition is deprecated, and it was the original aim to make\r\nof this a band of brothers working with unselfish devotion, unknown,\r\nwithout desire for any recognition, for their country. The formation of\r\nany dominant group or camarilla within the Central Committee is made\r\nimpossible by the regulations which govern its procedure.\r\n\r\nJust before the proclamation of the Constitution the initiates of the\r\nCommittee of Union and Progress, in Macedonia alone, numbered fifteen\r\nthousand. It was the duty of each member to spread the propaganda by\r\nconversing with men of all classes, a delicate and very dangerous\r\ntask, as one may well imagine. Many were arrested at the instance\r\nof the spies, to be imprisoned or to lose their lives. Many of the\r\ncaptured were taken to the Palace and offered large bribes in return\r\nfor information, and, this failing, tortures were applied, but with\r\nno effect. There was not one single instance of the betrayal of his\r\nbrethren by a member of the Society.\r\n\r\nThe organisation of this wonderful secret Society was very complete.\r\nTo meet the expenses each member was compelled to contribute a fixed\r\npercentage of his income to the Committee chest, while rich members,\r\nin addition to this tax, made generous donations when funds were\r\nrequired. Arms and ammunition were secretly purchased. A considerable\r\nsum was set apart annually to provide for the families of members\r\nwho lost life or liberty while working for the cause. Their several\r\nduties were apportioned to the members. There were the messengers who,\r\ndisguised in various ways, went to and fro over the Empire carrying\r\nverbal reports and instructions, for naturally communications between\r\nbranches of the association and orders to individual members could\r\nnot be confided to the postal and telegraph services. There were the\r\nmen who had to assassinate those whom the Committee had condemned to\r\ndeath—Government officials who were working against the movement with a\r\ndangerous zeal, and Palace spies who were getting on the scent. Other\r\nmembers were sent out to act as spies in the interest of the cause, and\r\nthe _contre espionage_ became at last so thorough that it baffled the\r\n_espionage_ of the Palace. Men whom the Palace paid as its spies were\r\noften the loyal agents of the secret Society. The Committee had its\r\nagents in every department of the Government, in the Civil Service, in\r\nthe War Office, in the Custom House, in the post and telegraph offices,\r\neven in the foreign post-offices in Constantinople and other big\r\ncities; so that official communications were intercepted and read and\r\nthe most secret designs of the Palace were revealed to the Committee\r\nand could therefore be circumvented. The Committee had its spies in\r\nthe Turkish Embassies in foreign countries, among the retainers of\r\ninfluential Pashas, and in the Yildiz Palace itself. For example, a\r\ncorrespondent, writing to the _Times_ from Salonica, tells the story\r\nof Dr. Baha-ud-Din, formerly physician to one of the Imperial princes,\r\nwho had been exiled to the Russian frontier. He returned secretly to\r\nthe capital, and for the three months preceding the revolution remained\r\nin the Palace undetected, supplying the Committee with a good deal\r\nof useful information. Suspicion fell upon him a few days before the\r\nrevolution broke out, so he had to flee for his life, and became an\r\nactive member of the Committee in Salonica.\r\n\r\nThen there was the host of propagandists who were scattered all over\r\nthe Empire doing their dangerous work, urging the civil population to\r\nembarrass the Government by a refusal to pay taxes and to prepare for\r\na general rising, and persuading the soldiery of the righteousness of\r\nthe movement, and obtaining their promise not to fight against their\r\nown countrymen when ordered to do so. So as to obtain easy access to\r\nhouses and barracks, Turkish officers disguised themselves as hawkers\r\nof cheap jewellery and ribbons, or as the peripatetic sutlers who sell\r\nsherbet and little comforts to the Turkish soldier; and in their packs\r\nwere always concealed the revolutionary tracts that were to spread\r\nthe propaganda. One well-known officer for long kept a barber’s shop\r\nin Baghdad, and inoculated his customers with the doctrines of the\r\nconspiracy. Dr. Nazim Bey, who had been exiled, wandered over Asia\r\nMinor for eighteen months, sometimes disguised as a peddler, sometimes\r\nas a _hodja_, in order to win over the Anatolian regiments. He made\r\ninitiates among the officers, and conversed with the men to such good\r\neffect that when the Sultan, in the last day of the old _régime_,\r\ndespatched several battalions of the Anatolian army, to crush the\r\nmilitary insurrection in Macedonia, these troops not only refused to\r\nfire on their comrades, but joined forces with them.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable feature of the propaganda was the great part taken in\r\nit by the Turkish women. They were largely employed, for example, in\r\nthe delivery of messages and the carrying of documents; for it was easy\r\nfor the wife of a member of the Committee to visit the wives of other\r\nmembers without attracting observation. The respect that is paid to\r\nwomen in Turkey gives them immunity from being searched; the women’s\r\napartments in a Turkish house are held to be inviolable, and a police\r\nofficer would not venture to infringe these cherished customs without\r\nvery weighty cause. The following incident exemplifies this: Shortly\r\nafter the revolution had made the Committee the virtual ruler of\r\nTurkey, some young officers were sent to pay a domiciliary visit to the\r\nhouse of a Pasha suspected of being a party to a reactionary plot. They\r\narrested the Pasha, but made a vain search for incriminatory documents.\r\nAt last they came across a chest that had obviously been concealed, and\r\nfelt confident that they had at last discovered what they were seeking.\r\nAt this juncture the Pasha’s wife came forward and stated that the\r\nchest contained her jewels and other property; whereupon the officers\r\nrefrained from opening it, and, saluting the lady, left the house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURKISH MARKET-WOMAN IN STREET DRESS]\r\n\r\nThe first and most important task before the Committee was, of course,\r\nthat of bringing round to the cause the Macedonian garrison—the Third\r\nArmy Corps. The disaffection of these troops, the reasons for which I\r\nhave explained, had in places manifested itself in open mutiny, and the\r\nincompetence and corruption of some of the officers of superior rank,\r\nwho were indebted to Palace favouritism for their position, filled\r\nboth the junior officers and the rank and file with an ever-increasing\r\ndisgust. By degrees a number of the young officers were affiliated to\r\nthe Committee, and received instructions to win over the rank and file.\r\nThe fact that the troops were moving about in small bodies, hunting\r\ndown the Bulgarian bands, rendered this proceeding the more easy; for\r\nwhile engaging in this work, regimental officers, unrestrained by the\r\nsupervision of their superiors, could give political instruction to the\r\nmen, and were able to hold meetings among themselves without attracting\r\nthe attention of spies; the company commanders used also to deliver\r\nlectures to their men in out-of-the-way places, where any stranger\r\nwould be conspicuous and Palace spies would be immediately recognised.\r\nWhenever a spy was discovered he promptly disappeared, soldiers who\r\nhad taken the oath of fealty to the Committee being given the word to\r\nkill him. At last the whole Macedonian army was won over to the cause\r\nof the Young Turks, and as a consequence of the work performed by the\r\ndisguised officers in other parts of the Empire, the Second Army Corps,\r\nwhich garrisons the Vilayet of Adrianople, also contained a large\r\nproportion of officers and men in sympathy with the movement—troops\r\nhostile to the Despotism thus enclosing the capital on all sides—while\r\non the farther shore of the Bosphorus, Anatolia, whose sturdy peasantry\r\nsupplies the Ottoman Empire with its finest troops, had been similarly\r\nprepared by Dr. Nazim Bey and numerous officers.\r\n\r\nTo those Englishmen who knew something of the Turkish army it appeared\r\nan amazing thing that these soldiers, who worshipped the Sultan with\r\na blind faith not only as their sovereign, but as the head of the one\r\ntrue religion, “the Commander of the Faithful,” “the Shadow of God upon\r\nearth,”—however discontented they might be, however ready to mutiny, as\r\nthey sometimes did mutiny, against their officers—could be persuaded to\r\njoin in a movement of which the avowed object was the deposition of the\r\nSultan Abdul Hamid. The soldier could only be won over by convincing\r\nhim that religion itself commanded the overthrow of the tyrant. It\r\nwill be remembered how, in 1876, the Sheikh-ul-Islam, as chief of the\r\ninterpreters of the Sacred Law, decreed that the Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz\r\nshould be deposed because, in ruining the State which God had confided\r\nto him, he had broken his sacred trust, and could no longer be head\r\nof the believers. The young officers put the case in the same way,\r\nand in simple words, to the honest and devout soldiery; they quoted\r\nthe passages in the Koran which denounce tyranny, and showed that the\r\nSultan was not true to his country, and therefore had forfeited the\r\nprivileges God had lent to him. The fact that Austria and Germany\r\nhad been granted concessions to construct railways through Turkish\r\nterritory (the proposed railway through the Sanjak of Novi-Bazaar,\r\nwhich would afford Austria railway connection with Salonica, and the\r\nGerman-owned Baghdad railway) was a proof to the soldier that the\r\nPalace was selling the country bit by bit to the foreigner.\r\n\r\nDuring the early days of the propaganda, _hodjas_ who had joined\r\nthe Committee, and officers disguised as _hodjas_, being freely\r\nadmitted into barracks in their capacity of preachers, advocated\r\nthese doctrines, and satisfied the religious scruples of the men;\r\nand when, later, the Sheikh-ul-Islam declared himself in favour of\r\nthe Constitution, there remained no doubt in their minds that they\r\nwere acting as their creed commanded in following the lead of their\r\nyoung officers. As a matter of fact, it was not difficult to show\r\nthat Abdul Hamid, to quote from Mr. Hamil Halid’s book, “The Diary of\r\na Young Turk,” was “the worst enemy of Islam, as no Moslem ruler has\r\never brought by his misdeeds so much shame upon the faith as he has.\r\nAny one who has observed his career closely knows that his actions\r\nare diametrically opposed to the principles of the Mussulman law and\r\ncreed.” Moreover, the Turkish soldier, like the soldiers in other\r\narmies and the majority of healthy young men, can be appealed to\r\nthrough his stomach, and he naturally acquired an affection for and\r\nconfidence in these majors, captains, and lieutenants of the new school\r\nwho sympathised with him, pitied his wretched condition, and with their\r\nown money, or the Committee funds, supplemented his miserable rations\r\nand supplied him with comforts.\r\n\r\nOf the methods of the propaganda in Macedonia we learn a good deal from\r\nthe published letters of Major Niazi Bey, the officer who first raised\r\nthe standard of revolt. He explains how, gradually, the young officers,\r\nhitherto estranged from one another by the mutual suspicions engendered\r\nby the system of _espionage_, were emboldened by the patriotic\r\nhopes held up before them, and through the possession of a common\r\nsecret became as a band of brothers, mutual confidence and affection\r\nincreasing daily; and how even those who had not been made members\r\nof the secret Society, and knew not its mysteries, were convinced by\r\ntheir affiliated comrades that the Committee was powerful and just,\r\nand was working in the sacred name of liberty for the integrity of the\r\nfatherland; and so sympathised heart and soul with the movement, and\r\nwere in readiness to co-operate with the revolutionaries.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the Committee was steadily undermining the entire\r\ncivil as well as military administration of the Empire. It acted, as a\r\nmember of the association put it to me, like a well-ordered but secret\r\nGovernment. It kept books in which were inscribed the names of all the\r\nhigher Government officials, with particulars as to their careers\r\nand habits—their _dossiers_, in short. Some of the enlightened and\r\nright-minded of these officials had been gained over to the cause; the\r\nothers were closely watched, and whether they were _Valis_, Inspectors\r\nGeneral, or Governors of districts, or what not, their moral influence\r\nwas destroyed, and their authority was made impotent by the fact that\r\ntheir subordinates, on whom they had to rely for the execution of their\r\nwishes, had almost without exception become adherents of the Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n_HOW THE REVOLUTION BEGAN_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been calculated by the Young Turks that the time would not be\r\nripe for their great _coup_ until the autumn of 1909, but the menace\r\nof further foreign intervention in Macedonia and an active campaign\r\nagainst the Committee, which was opened by the Palace at the beginning\r\nof 1908, precipitated the revolt. The propaganda had been spreading\r\nrapidly, the movement had been prospering, when suddenly the prospect\r\ndarkened, and there were happenings that threatened even to break up\r\nthe Society and shatter the hopes of the reformers.\r\n\r\nIt became known to the Committee that the British Government had\r\ndecided to withdraw from that “Concert of Europe,” which had failed so\r\nsignally in dealing with the question of reforms in Macedonia, and that\r\nEngland and Russia were now going to work together to introduce a most\r\ndrastic scheme of reform, which would include the suppression of all\r\nthe bands in Macedonia, of whatever race or creed, by means of flying\r\ncolumns of troops. This intended co-operation of England and Russia\r\ngreatly alarmed the Committee, such intervention, in the opinion of\r\nits leaders, necessarily leading to the disintegration of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire, and to an immediate foreign domination of Macedonia that would\r\nmake it impossible for the Committee to carry on its patriotic work in\r\nthis, the stronghold of the movement and the contemplated base for the\r\nrevolutionary campaign in the following year.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Union and Progress therefore held secret meetings\r\nin Salonica in May, 1908, and it was decided, in view of what was\r\nhappening, that it had now become necessary for the Committee to\r\nreveal to the European Powers the fact of its real existence and great\r\ninfluence, and also to explain to those Powers, especially to England,\r\nwhose aim was honest but which, in the opinion of many Turks, was\r\nbeing duped by Russia, that the Committee alone could bring peace to\r\nMacedonia, and that for various good reasons it would be better that\r\nEurope should abandon all these futile schemes of reform and leave\r\nMacedonia to work out her own salvation.\r\n\r\nA manifesto of the Committee was therefore drawn up and a copy of\r\nit was despatched to each of the European cabinets. These documents\r\nwere posted in the foreign post-offices in Salonica by members of the\r\nCommittee. A friend of mine told me of what a narrow escape he had\r\nwhile taking one of these letters to a certain foreign post-office. On\r\nentering the office he handed the letter to a Levantine clerk, who,\r\nafter reading the superscription, put to him the unusual question,\r\n“From whom do you bring this letter?” “From Mr. Snider,” replied my\r\nfriend, with ready invention, and hastened to leave the place. The\r\nclerk, evidently a Palace spy, followed him outside and looked up and\r\ndown the street, no doubt to find some agent whom he could send to\r\nfollow up the suspect. My friend fortunately got clear away before the\r\npursuit could be started, and for the future he gave that post-office a\r\nwide berth.\r\n\r\nThe manifesto itself is a long one. My quotations from it are literal\r\ntranslations from the original Turkish version. It speaks in the name\r\nof the Committee of Union and Progress, and, of course, as coming from\r\na secret society, bears no signatures. It opens thus:\r\n\r\n“We, the children of the fatherland called Turkey, of which Macedonia\r\nis a part—actuated by the love which we bear to the land of our birth,\r\nour desire to work in harmony to bring about its tranquillity and\r\nwelfare, and our wish to disabuse your minds of the false impression\r\nwhich we know you entertain to the effect that we (the Committee of\r\nUnion and Progress) are few in number and mischievous in our aims—now\r\nwrite to you the following, to explain to you from what evils Macedonia\r\nis really suffering, to show you what is the true remedy and the right\r\npath, and to save Europe from a number of vain efforts and avoidable\r\ndifficulties.”\r\n\r\nThe manifesto then proceeds to demonstrate that the efforts of the\r\nEuropean Powers to introduce reforms into Macedonia had not only been\r\nattended with no success, but had made the condition of the country\r\nworse than it had been before their interference, and that all the\r\nso-called remedies that had so far been applied had been introduced\r\nby foreigners only, “who assumed an attitude of generosity,” and not\r\nby “Ottomans, who must know more about their own country than the\r\nforeigner does.\r\n\r\n“We are told that the object of European reforms is to insure the\r\nhappiness of Macedonia, in answer to which we assert that Europe,\r\nin spite of all her efforts, has been unable to attain this object\r\nand never will attain it.... The intervention has been useless for\r\nEuropeans, injurious to the Ottomans. The Great Powers themselves admit\r\nthe failure of the measures adopted by them; and yet now, Europe,\r\ninstead of honourably withdrawing from this business, is, so it\r\nappears, about to make Macedonia the arena of yet further experiments.”\r\nThen the manifesto, after discussing the new schemes proposed by the\r\nBritish and Russian Governments, and showing how these, if carried\r\nout, would destroy the independence of an integral part of the Ottoman\r\nGovernment, declares that “We Mussulmans and Christians, united under\r\nthe name of the Ottoman Committee of Union and Progress, not influenced\r\nby national or religious fanaticism, are working together to deliver\r\nour country from foreign intervention, and to obtain our personal and\r\npolitical liberty from the existing Government. We positively assert\r\nthat these plans of England and Russia would sever Macedonia from the\r\nOttoman Empire. We therefore cannot accept these proposed measures,\r\nwhich would lead to the general ruin of the Empire, and are opposed\r\nto justice and civilization. We are determined to employ all means to\r\nobtain our natural rights.” The manifesto points out that the purely\r\nselfish action of Bulgaria, Greece, and Servia, which for purposes of\r\nannexation sent their bands to murder and ravage in Macedonia, was\r\nthe chief cause of the existing state of anarchy in the country; and\r\nit has a slap at our humanitarians, whose sole sympathy was with the\r\nChristians. As the first public declaration of the Committee, this is\r\nan exceedingly interesting document.\r\n\r\nI need scarcely say that the Committee of Union and Progress did\r\nnot receive a reply to its memorandum from any of the Great Powers.\r\nCabinets cannot well recognise and hold communication with a\r\nrevolutionary organisation whose aim it is to overthrow the Government\r\nof a friendly Power. Probably some of those to whom the manifesto was\r\naddressed read it with a contemptuous smile, little dreaming that\r\nwithin two months this band of unknown men would make itself the master\r\nof an Empire. One or two newspapers published brief summaries of the\r\nmanifesto without comment, for the world did not take the Young Turkey\r\nparty seriously until the revolution was an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\nOn June 10—that is, a week or so after the Committee had issued this\r\nmanifesto—King Edward VII met the Tsar at Reval and shortly afterwards\r\nthe details of the Anglo-Russian scheme for the pacification and better\r\nrule of Macedonia were communicated to the Powers. This forced the\r\nhands of the Committee; it was realised that the blow for Ottoman\r\nliberty must be struck soon, or it would be too late; but that which\r\nprecipitated the movement, driving the Macedonian officers into an\r\nimmediate revolt in self-defence, was the energetic action taken by the\r\nPalace spies at about this time.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1908 the Palace became alarmed by the reports that\r\ncame from the Macedonian garrisons. It is true that up to that time the\r\ndiscontent of the troops had assumed no revolutionary character, and\r\nat the meetings which they held in all the military centres the men,\r\nwhile demanding their rights under the military code, their arrears of\r\npay, their proper rations, and so forth, uttered no threats against the\r\nGovernment; but the discipline and organisation of the army had been\r\ndestroyed, and a number of the reservists in Macedonia went so far as\r\nto refuse to obey the call for service in the Hedjaz. The Palace now\r\nlearnt that a number of young officers were taking advantage of this\r\ndisaffection of the rank and file to spread treasonable propaganda. The\r\nrapid progress of the Young Turkey movement, and the wide dissemination\r\nof its doctrines through the towns and villages by trusted emissaries,\r\nmade it impossible to preserve a complete secrecy, and the creatures\r\nof the Palace, though they could not place their hands upon those who\r\ndirected this movement, felt that they were in the presence of a great\r\ndanger, all the more terrible on account of the mystery that enveloped\r\nit. So they laid their apprehensions before their ever-fearful master,\r\nwith the result that it was decided to take steps to effectually stamp\r\nout the conspiracy.\r\n\r\n_Espionage_ has ever been the favourite weapon of Abdul Hamid; so spies\r\nwere now poured into Macedonia to worm out the secrets of the movement\r\nand discover the leaders, and of these spies many never returned to\r\ntell their tale. The Sultan also gave orders to the senior officers\r\nin Macedonia to find out all they could about the movement, to arrest\r\nsuspected officers, and send them to Constantinople, and to address the\r\nmen solemnly concerning their duties, and especially impress it upon\r\nthem that to withdraw their fidelity and obedience from the Caliph,\r\n“the Shadow of God,” “the Commander of the Faithful,” was regarded by\r\nthe Moslem religion as the most heinous of sins. In March a special\r\nCommission, under Mahir Pasha, was sent from Constantinople to Salonica\r\nto institute an inquisition, but despite numerous denunciations,\r\nperquisitions, arrests, and tortures, it collected little evidence,\r\nand entirely failed to get at the heart of the plot, for there were no\r\ntraitors within that circle of devoted men. But the Commission was able\r\nto report to the Palace that there undoubtedly existed in Macedonia\r\na powerful secret society dangerous to the _régime_, and that the\r\nMacedonian troops could not be relied upon to support the Government.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Commission alarmed the Committee of Union and Progress,\r\nseveral of whose most useful members had been seized; and the young\r\nofficers in the army who had been affiliated realised their danger,\r\nand came to the conclusion that it would be expedient to start the\r\ninsurrection as soon as possible, before further arrests had seriously\r\nweakened their cause. Thus it happened that, quite a year before\r\nthe time originally contemplated by the Committee, Major Niazi Bey,\r\nat Resna, on July 3, took the momentous step. He openly disavowed\r\nhis allegiance to his sovereign, fled to the mountains with a band\r\nof Moslem civilians and some of the soldiers under his command, and\r\nissued his rebel manifesto, in which he called upon all patriots to\r\njoin in destroying the Government. I will tell later the story of the\r\ndoings of Niazi Bey, Enver Bey, and the other insurgent leaders in the\r\nmountains; how officers and men rallied round them; how they persuaded\r\nthe Bulgarian bands to join forces with them; how at last the entire\r\nMacedonian army had become the army of the Committee; and how, within\r\nthree weeks of that historic event—the raising of the banner of revolt\r\nat Resna—the revolution had triumphed and the Despotism was a thing\r\nof the past. At this stage I will describe the series of events that\r\nprecipitated the final struggle between the Palace and the Committee.\r\n\r\nIn view of the increasing activity of its enemies, the Committee, at\r\nits secret meetings, condemned to death and ordered the execution\r\nof such instruments of the Palace as were the most dangerous to the\r\ncause, including several of the senior officers in the Macedonian army\r\nand all those who were found to be spies or informers. Towards the\r\nend it must have become difficult for the Palace to find men willing\r\nto embark on so dangerous a profession as that of spy, even for the\r\nhighest pay. Had it not been for these assassinations the conspiracy\r\nmust have failed; at the cost of these few lives Turkey was saved; and\r\na terrible persecution of her best sons by the vengeful Palace was\r\nwarded off. These killings of the condemned as often as not were done\r\nin broad daylight, in a busy street, by officers in uniform, and no man\r\ninterfered with the executioners.\r\n\r\nThus, on July 7, General Shemshi Pasha, an able soldier, who, as\r\npossessing considerable experience in suppressing Macedonian and\r\nAlbanian risings, had been sent to crush the mutiny, was shot dead in\r\nthe streets of Monastir in broad daylight by a young officer. Next, the\r\nofficer commanding at Seres and certain other officers who upheld the\r\ncause of the Palace were killed. On July 10 the _imam_, or chaplain,\r\nof the artillery regiment in Monastir, who had been acting as a spy in\r\nbarracks, was shot in the streets of Salonica while he was on his way\r\nto the railway station to carry his information to the capital. On the\r\nsame day, and also in Salonica, an attempt was made on the life of Haki\r\nBey, a Palace informant, who had been a member of the Commission of\r\ninquiry. On July 12, General Sadik Pasha was shot while on a Messagerie\r\nsteamer bound from Salonica to Constantinople. The Committee was now\r\nfighting, so to speak, with the halter round its neck, and took no\r\nrisks; it removed those whose action might bring ruin upon the cause of\r\nthe Young Turks, for the chances of success or failure were still very\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nThe Palace realised its danger, and knew—what the outer world did not\r\nknow—that this was no ordinary mutiny of discontented troops. The\r\nSultan’s most trusted officers, when sent to crush the rising, could\r\nnot get their men to fire upon their insurgent fellow-Moslems, and\r\nwere sometimes themselves assassinated by them. For the first time\r\nin history the name of the Padishah had failed to inspire the pious\r\nOttoman soldiery with reverence and obedience. The Palace was now\r\nthoroughly alarmed, and no measure was omitted that could help to\r\nbring about the destruction of the Young Turkey conspiracy. It was\r\ndecided, among other things, that another effort should be made to\r\nget at the very heart of the movement, to strangle the secret Central\r\nCommittee, which, as the spies suspected, worked in Salonica; for if\r\nthe ringleaders and the central organisation could be exterminated, the\r\nmovement would become a lifeless thing and fall to pieces.\r\n\r\nSo Colonel Nazim Bey, an A.D.C. of the Sultan, one of the most detested\r\nand feared of the instruments of the Despotism, was sent to Salonica\r\nwith a body of spies to unearth the secret Committee. Nazim was a\r\ntypical creature of the Palace. Extravagant and vicious, ever in debt,\r\nlike Catiline, prodigal of his own while greedy for the possessions\r\nof others, clever, and quite unscrupulous, he was ready to sell his\r\nsoul for the moneys of which he was ever in need. He was appointed\r\nCommandant de Palace in Salonica. Denunciations were well paid for,\r\nso he denounced many officers, professional men, and students on the\r\nflimsiest evidence, for real evidence was not easily procurable. On one\r\nday he despatched thirty-eight young officers to Constantinople, who\r\nwere imprisoned on their arrival. But in many cases those whose arrest\r\nhe ordered were immediately set free or escaped with the assistance\r\nof officials in the police and other departments, many of whom, as I\r\nhave explained, were secret adherents of the Committee. Nazim, who knew\r\nwell what found favour in his master’s eyes, also sent reports to the\r\nPalace regarding the conduct of his superiors in Salonica, accusing\r\ndistinguished general officers of the head-quarters staff and others\r\nof carelessness, partiality, and covert sympathy with the Young Turks,\r\nwith the result that he was given still further emoluments, and was\r\nso strongly supported by the Palace that he was enabled to arrogate\r\nsuccessfully the chief authority in the city. The Committee of Union\r\nand Progress condemned Nazim to death, one of his own subordinates\r\nsigning the decree. A young lieutenant of infantry offered himself as\r\nthe executioner. Nazim, however, had taken fright, and on July 11 he\r\nfled from Salonica. As he was driving to the station in his carriage\r\nhe was shot at, but was only slightly wounded; so he was able to reach\r\nConstantinople and report to the Sultan the information which he had\r\ncollected concerning the revolutionary movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF CONSTANTINOPLE]\r\n\r\nAs the result of Nazim Bey’s alarming report, another Commission of\r\ninquiry was sent from Constantinople to Salonica. It was under the\r\npresidency of Ismail Mahir Pasha, General of Division and A.D.C. to the\r\nSultan—who, it having been discovered by the Committee that he was the\r\nleader of a reactionary plot, was shot dead in the streets of Stamboul\r\nby an officer in December last—and it contained, among other notable\r\nmen, Youssouf Pasha, Rejet Pasha, and Sadik Pasha. The ostensible\r\nobject of the Commission was to inspect arsenals and military stores;\r\nbut this the Commissioners never attempted to do. They took up their\r\nabode in the principal hotel in Salonica. A friend of mine, now editor\r\nof one of Turkey’s principal papers, who was told off by the Committee\r\nto live in the hotel and keep the Commissioners under observation,\r\nfound that they rarely ventured out of doors, but sent for and\r\nproceeded to examine closely all manner of men.\r\n\r\nThe _contre espionage_ conducted against them by the Committee to a\r\nlarge extent baffled their designs; even the people employed by the\r\nCommission to gather incriminating information were as often as not\r\ninitiates of the secret Society. But though the Commission could not\r\nget at the heart of the conspiracy it displayed great activity, and\r\nthe denunciations to the Palace were numerous; for, as with the other\r\nspy commissions, proofs of complicity in the plot were not necessary\r\nto condemnation, and to be known as an honest and patriotic Ottoman\r\nsubject was sufficient ground for accusation. The Commission also had\r\nits branches in the interior of Macedonia. In Monastir, Persepe, and\r\nother garrison towns certain officers became its agents; but most of\r\nthese were discovered by the Committee and had to flee, and some,\r\nincluding Sami Bey, Commissioner of Police in Monastir, were destroyed\r\nby the executioners of the Committee.\r\n\r\nSo thoroughly had all the machinery of official authority been\r\ndestroyed in Macedonia that it was difficult for the Commissioners\r\nto secure the arrests of those who had been denounced, therefore\r\ntreacherous methods were now employed to get the ring-leaders within\r\nthe clutches of the Palace. The Sultan believed that every man had\r\nhis price, and on previous occasions he had found bribery succeed\r\nwhere terrorism failed. The most flattering letters were sent to\r\nEnver Bey and other young staff-officers who had been forwarding\r\nthe revolutionary cause in the interior of Macedonia with such\r\nmarked success; they were invited to the Palace and were promised\r\nnot only forgiveness but large pecuniary rewards and promotion to\r\ngeneral rank. Many a good man from the time of Midhat Pasha had been\r\ntempted by the Palace to come out from some secure sanctuary to his\r\ndestruction by such wiles as these. So Enver Bey and his comrades\r\nignored this invitation, but at the same time, realising the danger\r\nof non-compliance, they fled to the mountains, organised bands,\r\nand as open insurgents precipitated the doom of the Despotism. At\r\nthe same time other methods of conciliation were attempted by the\r\nPalace. A large sum of hastily borrowed money was sent to Salonica to\r\ndischarge the arrears of pay due to the troops, and the authorities\r\nin Constantinople refrained from doing any injury to the thirty-eight\r\nyoung officers of the Macedonian army who had been imprisoned at the\r\nMinistry of War. To anticipate a little, these officers were pardoned\r\nand released on July 21 as the result of the Committee’s threat to kill\r\nall the general officers in Macedonia unless this was done.\r\n\r\nIsmail Pasha and his fellow-Commissioners returned to Constantinople,\r\ntheir efforts having had the effect of spreading the growth which they\r\nhad been sent to root up. The Palace, which throughout this crisis\r\nexemplified the truth that whom the gods wish to destroy they first\r\nmake demented, for it took every precaution too late and displayed a\r\nvacillation that ruined what chances it had, now decided to do what,\r\nif it had been done some months earlier, might have crushed the Young\r\nTurk movement and left Abdul Hamid the undisputed master of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire. It was decided to despatch a large army from Asia to overpower\r\nthe mutinous troops in Europe, and orders were given that no less than\r\nforty-eight battalions of Anatolian troops should be landed forthwith\r\nat Salonica. But before describing the failure of this last move on the\r\npart of the Despotism it will be necessary to go back a little to give\r\nan account of what had been happening in the interior of Macedonia\r\nsince Niazi Bey had raised the standard of revolt at Resna on July\r\n3, and of how everything was there being made ready for the general\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n_THE STANDARD OF REVOLT_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe situation in Macedonia in July, 1908, when Niazi Bey took to the\r\nmountains, may be summed up thus: The Bulgarian, Greek, Servian,\r\nWallach, and Albanian bands were murdering, robbing, outraging each\r\nother’s kin all over the country; the Committee of Union and Progress,\r\nhaving established its branches in Monastir, Ochrida, Resna, Persepe,\r\nand other places, was engaged in steadily spreading its propaganda\r\nthrough all the countryside, a large proportion of the young officers\r\nof the Macedonian army being initiates or sympathisers with the cause;\r\nand, lastly, the Palace had taken its precautions, and there was not a\r\ntown or regiment without its secret Government agents ferreting out the\r\nsecrets of the conspiracy and denouncing the suspects.\r\n\r\nNiazi Bey, the young officer who was the first to raise the standard of\r\nrevolt, was a good example of the men who were forthcoming in numbers\r\nat this period of Turkey’s great danger, men who proved to the world\r\nthe stubborn virtues of the old Ottoman stock, intensely patriotic,\r\nbrooding over the sorrows of their country, seeking a plan for her\r\ndeliverance, and, that plan once found, devoting themselves, with the\r\npassionate zeal of men obsessed by a fixed idea, to the carrying out of\r\ntheir high aim. They were not self-seeking; if they cherished ambition,\r\nit was for the martyr’s death; they were prepared to sacrifice their\r\ncareers, their wives and families, and their property for the cause,\r\nand, as we shall see, when Niazi set out with his little band of\r\nfollowers on that wonderful forlorn hope of his, each took an oath not\r\nto return to his wife and family until Turkey was freed; before going\r\nthey bade last farewells to those they loved; for them it was to be\r\nvictory or death. With a Mussulman Turk, love of country is a part\r\nof his religion, and his single-minded devotion has the strength of\r\nfanaticism. When in an oppressed country there is a sufficiency of men\r\nof this stamp, the days of the tyranny are numbered.\r\n\r\nThis spirit breathes through the published letters and diary of\r\nNiazi Bey, wherein, telling us a good deal in very frank fashion\r\nabout his thoughts, aspirations, and emotions, he provides us with\r\na most interesting human document. That he thus writes so freely\r\nand often with poetical diction concerning his sentiments will\r\nsurprise Englishmen, who have always heard that reserve is one of the\r\ncharacteristics of the Turk. The Turk is reserved in his relations\r\nwith the Western European, who so little understands him. But the\r\nTurk, as all his literature proves, is sentimental and emotional with\r\nthe sentiment and emotion that are the sources of strength and not\r\nof weakness. The Turk reveals his heart to his friend with a truthful\r\nsimplicity that would seem lack of proper reticence to Englishmen,\r\nmany of whom appear to be ashamed to let it be supposed that they\r\nhave any affection for their wives or parents; but we ourselves, as\r\nthe memoirs of the time show, did not take so much care to hide our\r\nemotions when Nelson was gaining victories on the seas. So Niazi,\r\nhaving no false shame, makes no secret of his brave deeds, his musings,\r\nand his affections, and one likes him the better for it. But Niazi,\r\nthough devoted to high ideals, was no dreamer or unpractical and rash\r\nrevolutionary. Like most of his countrymen he was endowed with plenty\r\nof cool common sense, and displayed the shrewdness and cunning of the\r\nHomeric Odysseus in the carrying through of his audacious adventure.\r\n\r\nNiazi Bey is himself an Albanian, his family belonging to the Mussulman\r\nland-owning class. He was born in Resna, a little town between Monastir\r\nand Ochrida, in a region where fertile valleys studded with orchards\r\nand cornfields, grassy downs, forest-clad mountains, craggy Balkan\r\npeaks and gorges, and broad lakes combine to make as beautiful a\r\nscenery as can be found in Europe. Niazi had known this countryside\r\nfrom his childhood, and he had friends in all the villages, so when\r\nit was decided to make this the scene of the first outbreak of the\r\ninsurrection it was recognised that he was the right man to come\r\nforward as leader. Niazi entered the army as a very young man and\r\ngreatly distinguished himself in the Greek war. Then he was sent\r\nto his own country, and for the five years preceding the revolution\r\nhe was employed with his battalion of _chasseurs_ in pursuing the\r\nvarious brigand bands in the mountains. Again he gained distinction,\r\ntemporarily crushed the power of the Bulgarian insurrectionary\r\nCommittee in the Resna district, and became very popular with the\r\nMoslem section of the population, whose property and lives he zealously\r\nset himself to protect. The Committee of Union and Progress, exercising\r\nits powerful underground influence, obtained for him promotion to the\r\nrank of Major and his appointment to head-quarters at Resna, the place\r\nin which he could serve the cause best. For Niazi had been initiated\r\ninto the secret Society by his brother officer, the now famous Enver\r\nBey, and throughout his operations against the bands was acting as the\r\ninstrument of the Committee rather than that of the despotic Government.\r\n\r\nThe story of Niazi’s work at this time throws an interesting light on\r\nthe condition of Macedonia. When he was moved to Resna, Bulgarian and\r\nAlbanian bands, acting in conjunction, were terrorising that district.\r\nIt was his duty to seize the leaders of the non-Moslem bands and to\r\nscatter the bands themselves. He was successful in doing this, though\r\nhis methods were not cruel or vindictive; for, as he tells us, he\r\nwas sorry to be hunting down these men who, after all, were fighting\r\nagainst a despotism which was as detestable to himself as it was to\r\nthem. So he used to call together the Christian notables, who had\r\nknown him from his childhood and trusted him, and point out to them\r\nthat their separatist dreams could never be realised, that it was\r\nbetter for them to repudiate those bringers of bloodshed, the agitators\r\nin Athens, Sophia, and Belgrade, and join in union and brotherhood with\r\ntheir Moslem fellow-countrymen, whose grievances against the Government\r\nwere as heavy as their own. His words, recognised as sincere, produced\r\na good effect.\r\n\r\nAt Niazi’s advice some Moslem inhabitants of the district formed\r\nthemselves into a band which was under the direction of the Committee\r\nof Union and Progress. This band used to go about the country,\r\nprotecting the villagers without any distinction of race or creed. Thus\r\nat one time it would be defending a village of Bulgarians against the\r\nattack of a Serb band, and at another time a Serb village against a\r\nBulgarian band. This band was well disciplined, committed no excesses\r\nof any kind, and did not even requisition the necessaries of life in\r\nthe villages; conduct so extraordinarily Quixotic for a Macedonian band\r\nthat it gained for the Committee the good opinion of the Albanians, who\r\nbegan to come in numbers to Ochrida and Monastir to take the oath of\r\nallegiance to the revolutionary leaders.\r\n\r\nBut so fast as the labours of Niazi and the Committee helped on the\r\npacification of the country, so fast did the evil policy of the\r\nGovernment, alternating between encouragement of lawlessness and cruel\r\nrepression, undo all the good that had been effected. The corrupt\r\ntribunals could be bought. Thus, after the troops under Niazi had\r\nbrought in some hundreds of people who had been found in the possession\r\nof bombs and arms, their trial resulted in the condemnation of twenty\r\npoor peasants and the acquittal of all the really dangerous rebels who\r\nhappened to be rich townsmen, a miscarriage of justice which held Niazi\r\nand his brother officers up to ridicule and of course encouraged the\r\nChristian bands to redouble their mischievous activity. On the other\r\nhand, the Government sent to Persepe, to put down the insurgents, an\r\nofficer of passionate temper who did not know the customs or languages\r\nof the people, and was unable to gain their confidence. He tortured and\r\nbeat the peasantry and behaved with such inhumanity that the foreign\r\nPowers made representations to the Porte on the subject. Thus dictated\r\nto, the Government arrested and sent away this officer, again with the\r\nresult that the Bulgarian bands were encouraged in their brigandage,\r\nas was always the case when foreign intervention humiliated Turkey.\r\nAt this time, too, the Committee found an enemy in the Russian Consul\r\nfor this district. He exerted his influence to procure the withdrawal\r\nof Niazi Bey from the scene of his successful labours. So Niazi was\r\nsummoned to Salonica and was rebuked by the General in command, but\r\nhe was not impeached and, fortunately for his country, he was allowed\r\nto return to his post at Resna. The Government of Russia was then\r\narranging with that of England its joint intervention in Macedonia,\r\nand any improvement in the state of affairs of that region that might\r\nrender such intervention unnecessary would no doubt have been regarded\r\nas a calamity by Russian statesmen.\r\n\r\nAt about this time Kermanle Metre, once a leader of a rebel band, who\r\nhad been pardoned and had since done signal service as a Government\r\nofficer, was tried and condemned to death unjustly, as the result of\r\nRussian intrigue. This cowardly betrayal of a valued servant by the\r\nGovernment aroused profound indignation throughout the Macedonian\r\narmy, and was one of the most important of the factors that combined\r\nto effect the moral union between, not only the army, but also the\r\nMoslem civil population, with the Committee of Union and Progress;\r\nfor the incident was a proof to the Mussulmans that the Government\r\nwas an immoral one, “acting in defiance of the Sacred Law, the Moslem\r\nReligion, and Ottoman ideals.” Niazi Bey himself received orders\r\nto take Kermanle Metre to Monastir and he determined to save his\r\nprisoner’s life at the risk of his own. So, after arresting him, he\r\nconnived at his flight, and the agents of the Committee restored the\r\nman to his home. This escape of their compatriot from the gallows\r\nwith the assistance of the Committee of Union and Progress produced a\r\ngreat effect upon the Bulgarian peasants in the district, who said to\r\nthemselves that a power that administered justice had at last risen\r\nin the land; and from this time the Bulgarian revolutionaries used to\r\nlisten with an increasing respect and sympathy to Niazi when he argued\r\nthat Mussulmans and Christians, being all brothers of one fatherland,\r\nshould work in union to obtain a Government that would assure justice\r\nand equality for all.\r\n\r\nWhile Bulgarians, Greeks, and Serbs in Macedonia by noise and violence\r\nhad been urging their racial claims in anticipation of the break-up\r\nof the Turkish Empire, the Moslem Turks under the direction of the\r\nCommittee of Union and Progress had been steadily and patiently working\r\nfor the liberation of their country, employing methods so secret that\r\nthe outer world knew nothing of the movement and was deceived into\r\nthinking that the Mussulman backbone of the population was regarding\r\nthe progress of events with indifference. The European Powers had\r\nignored the memorandum in which the Committee had protested against\r\nthe intervention of England and Russia in Macedonia, and patriots\r\nrecognised that the time had arrived to come out in the open and strike\r\nthe blow for freedom before that intervention and the increasing\r\nactivity of the Palace spies had made it too late to act with any\r\nchance of success. Towards the end of June it was realised that it\r\nneeded but a spark to start a general rising, and it was decided that\r\ncertain young officers, who were members of the Committee, should\r\nabandon the Government service, form bands in various places, take to\r\nthe mountains and organise the insurrection of the united Mussulman and\r\nChristian populations.\r\n\r\nNiazi Bey apparently was the first to conceive this idea. He had become\r\nthe zealot whose mind is occupied by but one thought; he tells us that\r\nhe did not sleep for three nights after learning the result of the\r\nReval meeting. He formed his plan. The population of the Resna district\r\nwas largely Moslem, and in both town and country the organisation of\r\nthe Committee of Union and Progress was practically complete. In that\r\nmountainous and wooded region a Moslem band, helped by a sympathetic\r\npeasantry, could, if necessary, hold the Government troops for months\r\nand years. So he broached the matter to his friend Jemal Bey, president\r\nof the municipality of Resna; Tahir Effendi, the Police Commissioner;\r\nand other of the brethren; and it was arranged to hold a secret meeting\r\nof the adherents of the Committee in the house of one Haji Agha, on the\r\nevening of June 28.\r\n\r\nAbout fifty men were present at this meeting. The following is a\r\nsummary of the report of the proceedings as published by the Committee.\r\nNiazi Bey, after the usual salutations, thus addressed the brethren:\r\n“Fellow-countrymen and comrades. You have sworn by the Unity of God\r\nto obey the commands of the Committee, and to save the country, which\r\nis being destroyed by traitors, by working together in concord and\r\ngiving your lives and property freely. Is it not so?” All cried,\r\n“_Evet! evet!_” (Yes! yes!). “The time has come,” continued Niazi,\r\n“to redeem that sacred vow. The country now needs our devotion. Our\r\nvile Government is regarding with indifference the compact which has\r\nbeen agreed upon at Reval between the Tsar of Russia and the King of\r\nEngland, which aims at the division of our fatherland and the delivery\r\nof it into the hands of our enemies. The cruel scheming of Europe can\r\nonly be frustrated by the blood of the nation. It is the decision\r\nof the Committee that we should rise as a nation against the vile\r\nTurkish Government which is bowing its head before this humiliating\r\ncompact. It was at Resna that the Bulgarians first revolted, and\r\nbrought this calamity upon us. So, therefore, at Resna shall our first\r\nstandard of revolt be raised—a general revolt, without distinction\r\nof creed or race, against the despotic Government. I have prepared\r\neverything. I can provide all that is needed to equip a band of two\r\nhundred men—money, arms, ammunition, cartridge-belts, sandals. I only\r\nneed enthusiastic and devoted men; but I want in them a devotion\r\nthat will sacrifice family, the comforts and sweets of life, all\r\nworldly relations, and the love of the world, for the salvation of\r\nthe country. If the salvation of the fatherland cannot be gained,\r\nthen those who follow me must look upon death with affection as the\r\ngreatest boon. I ask your forgiveness for reminding you of what\r\nhigh-minded self-sacrifice is demanded of those who will advance in\r\nthe van of the forces of liberty; for, knowing you as I do, I do not\r\nimagine that there is one among you who will shirk his duty. I will\r\nexplain to you our purpose. You know that the intervention of Europe\r\nin our internal affairs was brought about by the complaints of the\r\nChristians, who suffered less than did we Moslems under the Despotism,\r\nand that the Government has opened a road for this intervention by\r\nits despicableness and cowardice, making Turkey a by-word among the\r\nnations for all that is bad. Now, in this revolution we have to\r\nmake manifest to the world in a practical fashion that we love the\r\nChristians, as being our brethren under the same fatherland, that we\r\nhold them equal to ourselves, that we recognise the security of their\r\nhonour as our honour, of their lives as our lives, of their property as\r\nour property. This revolt is not against individuals, but against the\r\nsystem of government, which has not only stirred up strife between the\r\ndifferent creeds and races, but has also made us Moslems the enemies\r\nof each other. This is a revolt in the name of liberty, equality,\r\nand brotherhood. To bring justice to the people we will traverse the\r\nmountains until we have sacrificed our lives. I am sending to Monastir\r\nmy wife (Niazi had been married but nine months and was very attached\r\nto his wife), and my sister with her fatherless children, for they have\r\nnone but me to take care of them; and there my relatives wall protect\r\nthem. I will bid an everlasting farewell to these dear ones, and I will\r\nshut up my house. Are there any among you who will follow me heart and\r\nsoul?”\r\n\r\nThen all those present with one voice replied: “We look to dying with\r\nyou in honour and felicity. We are all ready.” The following Friday\r\nwas fixed upon as the date of the rising of the people of Resna, and\r\nit was agreed that on that day, at the hour of morning prayer, the\r\nband of two hundred patriots should assemble near the barracks. Jemal\r\nEffendi was sent to Monastir to apprise the central Committee in that\r\ntown of Niazi’s plan and to obtain permission to carry it out. Then the\r\nbrethren, having embraced one another, with tears of joy and pride in\r\ntheir eyes, broke up the meeting, departing in twos and threes so as\r\nnot to attract the notice of the spies.\r\n\r\nWithin two days Jemal returned from Monastir with the required\r\npermission from the central Committee, and Niazi made all preparations\r\nfor the fateful Friday. As he was thus engaged, an incident occurred\r\nwhich, in his opinion, to no small extent favoured the fortunes of his\r\nadventure. There came to appeal to him, with lamentations and tears,\r\nthe sister of the famous Bulgarian revolutionary leader, Christe. A\r\nServian band, which had recently killed a member of her family, had\r\nnow carried off into the mountains the child of this poor woman, and\r\ndemanded impossible ransom. Niazi swore to the woman that he would\r\nrescue the child for her, and he decided to take into the mountains\r\nwith him the Servian schoolmaster of Resna as a hostage. Niazi’s\r\nsuccess in recovering the child shortly afterwards went a long way\r\ntowards gaining the confidence of the Bulgarians and convincing them\r\nof the good intentions of those who served the Committee of Union and\r\nProgress.\r\n\r\nThe night that preceded the going forth of the band was spent by\r\nNiazi in writing various manifestos and letters, which it was his\r\npurpose to send out when he was clear of the town and out of the power\r\nof the agents of the Government. In a manifesto which he addressed\r\nto the Chief Secretary of the Imperial Palace; to Hilmi Pasha, the\r\nInspector-General at Salonica (the present Grand Vizier); and to the\r\nVali of Monastir, he explained that the Committee of Union and Progress\r\nrepresented the whole nation and was very powerful; that its aim was\r\nto obtain a just form of government, like that in civilised countries,\r\nand to preserve the integrity of the Empire. He stated that, in view of\r\nthe number of spies who had been sent by the Government to Salonica to\r\ndestroy those who were silently working for their country’s good, the\r\nCommittee had taken measures to protect the patriots; that on that day\r\ntwo hundred _fedais_ (devoted ones), armed with Mauser rifles, under\r\nthree officers, were marching from Resna; that elsewhere other bands\r\nwere being formed, representing all the elements of the population, and\r\nthat these bands would inflict punishment on the traitorous spies who\r\ndisgraced the army to which they belonged. The Committee demanded that\r\nthe spying Pashas and their assistants should be at once sent back to\r\nConstantinople by special train. It also demanded that the Fundamental\r\nLaw (the Constitution) should be restored immediately and that the\r\nChamber of Deputies should assemble as soon as it was possible. If\r\nthe Government refused to grant these requests, then the nation would\r\nobtain by force what it required, and the responsibility for the\r\nbloodshed would rest with the high dignitaries of the State.\r\n\r\nThen he wrote letters to the commander of the regiment of _gendarmes_\r\nat Monastir, to the lieutenant of _gendarmerie_ at Resna, and to\r\ncertain other officers who had sold themselves to the Palace, and\r\nsolemnly warned them, in the name of the two hundred _fedais_ of the\r\nCommittee of Union and Progress, that if they continued to disgrace\r\ntheir military uniform by acting as spies over their comrades, and by\r\nshowing themselves the sycophants of the Government and the foreign\r\nofficers, thereby betraying their fatherland which was agonising “like\r\na sorely wounded lion;” and that if they did not at once reform their\r\nconduct and cease to be the active enemies of the National Union, death\r\nwould be the punishment awarded to them by the Committee. Men had\r\nalready discovered that the Committee never uttered idle threats, and\r\nthe recipient of one of these letters was so terrified that he became\r\ninsane.\r\n\r\nThe momentous day (July 3, 1908) dawned, and Niazi Bey was up betimes\r\nto complete his preparations. For his band to march out of Resna while\r\nthe officers, who were not adherents of the cause, and the considerable\r\ngarrison remained in it was, of course, out of the question, so he\r\nemployed a ruse to empty the town of those who might oppose him. By\r\npre-arrangement some members of the Committee came into Resna and\r\nreported that a Bulgarian band was moving up the road near Ismilova,\r\nthat is, in a direction contrary to the one in which he intended to\r\nlead his own followers; and some rifles were fired in the hills to\r\nsupport the story. Thanks to this scheme, all the available troops\r\nwere hurried off to attack this imaginary band, leaving but a few\r\nofficers and men to guard the barracks, which are situated on a height\r\noverlooking the town and about a mile and a half distant from it.\r\n\r\nNiazi then walked to the barracks in his uniform, while the members of\r\nhis band in twos and threes collected in the neighbourhood. He passed\r\nthrough the gates of the barracks just after the Moslem officials and\r\ninhabitants of Resna had entered the mosques for the Friday midday\r\nprayer; he made the appointed signal with his sword, and his _fedais_,\r\nto the number of one hundred and fifty, poured into the barracks,\r\narousing no suspicion among the soldiers on guard, who were led to\r\nunderstand that Major Niazi Bey was arming a party of Moslem civilians\r\nwith the object of proceeding to the scene of action to co-operate with\r\nthe troops.\r\n\r\nFollowing Niazi Bey’s instructions, the _fedais_ broke open the rifle\r\nand ammunition cases and armed themselves, many of the men taking\r\ntwo rifles each, so that those who joined the band later on might be\r\nprovided with weapons. Niazi also opened the military chest and took\r\nall the money that was in it, amounting to about £500, making out a\r\nreceipt for it in which he explained for what purpose he was about to\r\nuse it. Then the band, in perfect order and full of enthusiasm, marched\r\nout of the barracks, and with it went nine private soldiers who, being\r\nstill under the impression that Niazi was leading a detachment against\r\nthe Bulgarians, had volunteered their services. After marching for two\r\nhours they came to cross-roads on the summit of a grassy down, where\r\nNiazi’s band was joined, as had been arranged, by Lieutenant Osman\r\nEffendi and his detachment of _fedais_ from Persepe, consisting of a\r\nlieutenant, four soldiers, and thirty civilians.\r\n\r\nHere a halt was called for rest and food, and before the march was\r\nresumed Niazi called the men around him and addressed them, explaining\r\nhis aims and the strict rules of discipline which the Committee had\r\nenjoined him to enforce. He reminded them that they had sworn upon\r\nthe Unity of God to devote their lives to the salvation of their\r\nfatherland. “The nation expects you,” he said, “to set a brilliant\r\nexample of self-sacrifice and Ottoman chivalry worthy to be imitated.\r\nAre you prepared never to see your homes again until the salvation\r\nof the country has been secured, and willingly to die for her?” His\r\nfollowers cried out, “Yes, yes; it shall be death or salvation.” Then\r\nNiazi proceeded, “There may be some among you who have not the physical\r\nstrength to live the hard life before us, to support the long marches\r\non foot, thirst, hunger, nakedness, heat, and cold. If there be such I\r\ngive them full permission to retire; let them go back to their villages\r\nand pray for us.” As there was no reply to this, he went on to speak\r\nof the very lofty sense of duty and the strict rules of conduct that\r\nshould govern the _fedais_, who, having bid farewell to life, were now\r\nready to sacrifice themselves for the fatherland. Their enemies were\r\nmany, and would certainly slander them; but it behooved them so to act\r\nthat none could look askance at them with good reason. It was for them\r\nto exemplify by the righteousness of their lives what was meant by “the\r\nexaltation of the glory of Islam and the Ottomans, through obedience to\r\nthe Sacred Law of Mohammed which was the basis of the Constitution.”\r\nThe Constitution was to bring equality and justice to all Ottomans\r\nwithout distinction of race and religion. They, as the apostles of the\r\nConstitution, must exemplify this equality and justice. It behooved\r\nthem, while the band wandered over the country, to regard the honour\r\nof the inhabitants as their own honour, to be kindly in their dealings\r\nwith them, to be guilty of no act of oppression, to thieve nothing,\r\nthough urged by the pangs of hunger, and above all things to respect\r\nall the women of the country and to observe chastity. He explained that\r\nhe would punish, without exception, any of his followers who in the\r\nabove respects was a wrong-doer even in the slightest degree, and that\r\nthe one penalty that he would inflict would be that of death; for the\r\nsafety of the fatherland necessitated this severity. He told them that\r\nhe had taken measures to provide for their immediate needs. He would\r\ngive each man three Turkish pounds for the support of his family and\r\ntwo silver _medjidiehs_ for his tobacco, and he undertook to procure\r\nfood and clothes for them. “These are the stringent conditions of\r\nservice,” he concluded. “Do you approve of them? If so, swear by the\r\nUnity of God that you accept them from your heart and soul.”\r\n\r\nIn reply the _fedais_ raised an enthusiastic cry of “_Wallahi,\r\nbillahi_” (in the name of God, yes!).\r\n\r\nOf the nine private soldiers who had marched from Resna under the\r\nbelief that they were being led against the Bulgarians, four now asked\r\npermission to return. Niazi took their arms and sent them back to\r\nthe officer commanding the battalion of _chasseurs_ at Resna, with a\r\nletter in which he explained that the men were in no wise to blame, as\r\nthey had been deceived by himself. Of the civilians who had joined the\r\nband only one displayed timidity at this last moment, so Niazi allowed\r\nhim to return to his home and entrusted the man with the letters and\r\nmanifestos which he, Niazi, had written during the previous night,\r\ninstructing him to deliver them to the _mudir_ of the district; and\r\nto the _mudir_ he sent a separate letter, ordering him, with threats,\r\nto forward these documents to the various people to whom they were\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\nThen the bugle sounded and the little band of zealots marched on again\r\nthrough the beautiful Balkan countryside, in the glorious summer\r\nweather, to their unknown destiny—a band of sworn ascetics who harmed\r\nno men save the agents of the Despotism who stood in their way, and\r\nthese they slew without pity; to all others they were as brothers,\r\nprotecting the weak and oppressed of whatsoever race or creed,\r\npreaching the gospel of justice and equality.\r\n\r\nThe bands of the racial propaganda that had hitherto passed through\r\nthe Balkans had terrorised the population with murder, robbery, and\r\nthe violation of women, whereas this band gained the confidence of\r\nall and was welcomed in the villages. This was indeed as a company of\r\nknights-errant, but these were no visionaries tilting at wind-mills;\r\nthe aim of the _fedais_ was the overthrow of the reign of tyranny and\r\ncorruption; Niazi’s bands and the other bands of the Committee of Union\r\nand Progress which followed its example actually succeeded, as we shall\r\nsee, not only in winning over the entire Moslem population of this\r\nregion to the cause, but in uniting the various races that had been\r\ncutting each other’s throats for years, so that the whole strength of\r\nthe Macedonian peoples was brought together to oppose the Despotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n_THE INSURRECTION IN BULGARIA_\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin a few hours of the departure of Niazi Bey and his band from\r\nResna, the officials of the Yildiz had been informed by telegraph of\r\nthe outbreak of the insurrection. After a consultation of the Sultan’s\r\nadvisers a telegram was sent to General Shemshi Pasha, then in command\r\nat Mitrovitza in the northern Vilayet—who was, as I have explained\r\nin a former chapter, a trusted officer, than whom none had greater\r\nexperience in crushing revolt in Macedonia and Albania—recounting to\r\nhim what had occurred, and ordering him with the least possible delay\r\nto move the necessary troops from Mitrovitza to Monastir, and to raise\r\nvolunteers from among the people, “so as to surround and seize the\r\nungrateful traitor, Niazi, together with the officers, officials,\r\nprivate soldiers, and civilians who are his companions.” The General\r\nwas further informed that his Majesty expected him to prove his\r\nfidelity and loyalty by making these wicked men a telling example to\r\nother seditious persons, and relied upon him to cleanse that portion of\r\nthe Empire of this mischief and to prevent its spread by measures of\r\nthe severest nature.\r\n\r\nThe ill-fated Shemshi displayed his loyalty and zeal by working night\r\nand day to compass the destruction of Niazi and his band of _fedais_.\r\nOn July 6 he arrived with two battalions at Monastir by special train;\r\nanother battalion was closely following, and seven other battalions\r\nwere marching into the disturbed districts. The usual trickery of\r\nwhich the creatures of the Palace were so fond was also employed to\r\nsupport the operations of the troops. Thus, in order to excite Moslem\r\nfanaticism and persuade men to serve as volunteers, it was assiduously\r\nrumoured that the Christians were rising to massacre the Mussulmans,\r\na falsehood that produced but little effect; while delegates were\r\nsent through the villages to tell the people that the Constitution\r\ndesired by the Committee of Union and Progress, and advocated by the\r\nbands under Niazi and others, was opposed to the religion of Islam,\r\n“its doctrines being as vile as that which permits women to go about\r\nunveiled.” The Palace also arranged with the local officials that\r\nattempts should be made to corrupt the members of Niazi’s band, rank\r\nand money being offered to any of these who would kill him.\r\n\r\nIn the telegrams in which he reported progress to the Palace, Shemshi\r\nstated that he was unable to obtain any reliable information concerning\r\nthe rebels from either the military authorities or the Vali, and that\r\nno one could tell him where the Committee of Union and Progress was,\r\nor the names of its members. All that his spies had been able to\r\ndiscover was that the heads of the people in those parts were full of\r\nseditious ideas and that many men of importance were on the Committee;\r\nthe movement was evidently spreading, and Staff-Major Enver Bey had\r\nabandoned his uniform and gone off to join the seditious Committee.\r\nNevertheless he, Shemshi Pasha, assured his Majesty the Caliph that\r\nhe would exert himself until he breathed his last breath (words\r\nthe literal truth of which were soon to be proved) to root up this\r\nseditious growth. He, moreover, reported that he had sent messages\r\nto the Albanian notables, and that thousands of brave Albanians were\r\nprepared, in answer to his call, to pour into the disaffected districts\r\nand punish these people who were unfaithful to their religion and\r\ntraitors to their sovereign. He also announced that two battalions\r\nwould at once march in the direction of Resna, and that he was\r\nconfident of his speedy success in stifling the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nHis confidence was misplaced, for of the Albanian chiefs upon whose\r\nhelp he relied the greater number had become adherents of the Committee\r\nof Union and Progress, while all the officers and non-commissioned\r\nofficers of one of the two battalions which he was sending to surround\r\nNiazi had sworn the oath of fidelity to the Committee. But Shemshi\r\nhad his doubts; for he confessed to the notables of Monastir that the\r\nRumelian troops which he had brought with him were not of much account,\r\nand that he was anxiously awaiting the arrival of an entire division\r\nof Anatolian troops which the Government was sending to him from Asia\r\nMinor. Shemshi’s own brother-in-law, an officer of _gendarmerie_ in\r\nMonastir, and a member of the Committee, while unable, of course, to\r\ntake him into his confidence, attempted to prevent a useless shedding\r\nof Moslem blood and to save the General’s own life, by warning him\r\nthat the troops of Resna and its neighbourhood would refuse to obey\r\nhis orders if they were called upon to fire on Niazi’s band. In the\r\nmeanwhile the Committee of Union and Progress had full knowledge\r\nof all the plans of the Government; for telegraph clerks and other\r\nofficials who were secret adherents of the cause were able to betray\r\nthe communications that passed between the Yildiz and the military\r\nauthorities in Monastir.\r\n\r\nThe Committee was actively employed in frustrating the plans of the\r\nGovernment. In order to counteract the influence of the false reports\r\nthat had been circulated by the agents of the Despotism it placarded\r\nthe walls of Monastir with manifestos on the night before Shemshi’s\r\narrival. These manifestos explained that the aim of the Committee was\r\nto free Turkey from her traitorous Government which had been corrupting\r\nthe nation for thirty years and was now betraying her to foreigners.\r\nIt called for the immediate removal of the spies who had been sent\r\nrecently from Constantinople, and protested against the illegal\r\ncarrying off of the people denounced by the spies, to the Inquisitions\r\nof the Yildiz and the Central Police in the capital.\r\n\r\nThe Committee also organised numerous bands in various parts of the\r\ncountry so as to confuse the Government, divide its forces, and prevent\r\na concentrated attack on Niazi. It kept up constant communication with\r\nNiazi, keeping him well informed of the movements of his enemies. The\r\nCommittee enjoined him to avoid coming into contact with the troops\r\nthat had been sent against him, but if this became impossible, to force\r\non a decisive action that would do the Government great damage. As\r\nthe object of the Committee was to unite all the different elements\r\nof the Ottoman population, a civil war, at this juncture, especially\r\nif it took the form of a conflict between the Moslem soldiery and the\r\nMoslem peasantry, would obviously be a deplorable calamity. But there\r\nwas to be no sparing of the Government spies; and the Committee gave\r\norders that the Palace agents, who were wandering through the villages\r\ngaining information and poisoning the minds of the people against the\r\nConstitution, should be put to death.\r\n\r\nAnd now to return to Niazi Bey and his wanderings. After his halt on\r\nthe afternoon of his departure at the cross-roads, where his band,\r\nreinforced by Osman Effendi’s contingent of _fedais_ from Persepe, had\r\nattained the strength which he considered to be the most suitable for\r\nhis purpose, the march was continued to the Moslem village of Labcha,\r\nto most of whose inhabitants he and his followers were well known.\r\nThe _fedais_ entered the village shouting _Allahu Akber_, “God is\r\nvery great,” and _La ilaha illallah_, “there is no God but God!” Then\r\nNiazi, through the Elective Council of the village, called in all the\r\npeasants who were working in the fields and addressed them. Here the\r\nground had been well prepared. There were none among the inhabitants\r\nwho did not desire the restoration of the Constitution. They fell upon\r\nthe necks of Niazi and his men and embraced them, rejoicing to see that\r\nthese saviours of the country were now openly working for the cause.\r\n\r\nHere one of the elders of the village, an ex-sergeant of the army,\r\nbegged to be allowed to join the band. “Do not deprive me of this\r\nhappiness,” he said; “for even if we fail, true martyrdom can be gained\r\non this expedition.” But Niazi replied, “My heart wants you with me,\r\nbut you must stay here, for this village needs your presence. I intend\r\nto make Labcha my principal base and our place of refuge, so here you\r\ncan help the cause more than by following me.” The sergeant therefore\r\nremained in Labcha, where his zeal, fidelity, and mother wit were of\r\ngreat service. An incident which occurred in this village some time\r\nlater throws a curious light on the system of self-government which was\r\nintroduced by the Committee of Union and Progress into the villages\r\nthat had accepted the Committee as their virtual ruler. The sister of\r\nthe above-mentioned sergeant had told her husband, a man of Resna, what\r\nshe knew concerning the oath which the representatives of the Committee\r\nhad administered to certain leading inhabitants of Labcha; and this\r\nfoolish fellow had gone about boasting that he was in possession of\r\nthe secret, mentioning the names of initiates. The sergeant, on hearing\r\nthis, summoned the villagers to a meeting at which it was decided that,\r\nas a punishment for both these babblers, the man should immediately\r\ndivorce his wife. The husband and wife came before this irregular\r\ntribunal, whose orders had to be obeyed more implicitly than those of\r\nthe law courts of the State, and on begging for forgiveness obtained\r\nthe revocation of the sentence that would have separated them. This\r\nevent led to the creation of a female police or vigilance committee in\r\nthis and some other villages, whose chief duty it apparently was to\r\ncheck indiscreet gossip concerning the Committee.\r\n\r\nAs in Labcha and the surrounding villages all the men were strong\r\npartisans of the Committee, there was no more work to be done here for\r\nNiazi’s band, and therefore, after purchasing provisions and refreshing\r\nthemselves, the _fedais_ set out again to march through the night.\r\n\r\nIn the following afternoon they came to the neighbourhood of the\r\nAlbanian town of Ochrida, where there were many Palace spies and a\r\nconsiderable garrison, so that it was not possible for the band to\r\nenter it; but there was also here an important branch of the Committee\r\nof Union and Progress, and a large proportion of the inhabitants were\r\nat heart adherents of the cause. So Niazi, leaving his band encamped\r\nin a cherry orchard in the hills, walked into the town under cover of\r\nthe night. Major Eyoub Effendi and other members of the Committee,\r\nwho were old friends of his, had a meeting with him at the house of\r\none of the faithful, and welcomed him heartily. They told him that two\r\ndetachments of troops had left Resna to surround his band. They sent up\r\nto his camp leather water bottles and other necessaries of which his\r\nmen were in want, and gave him great encouragement. Here he took the\r\nopportunity of sending a manifesto to the Albanian Committee, as it\r\nturned out later, with excellent result, for Niazi, whose birthplace\r\nwas near the Albanian border, and who was himself of Albanian stock,\r\nhad many friends among the Albanians, and was much respected by them.\r\nHe also wrote a letter to his old foe Cherchis, the famous leader of\r\nBulgarian bands. In this letter he explained his aim to Cherchis, and\r\ntold him that he, Niazi, who had formerly pursued Cherchis’ band with\r\nsuch vigour, now extended to him the hand of friendship, and asked\r\nfor an interview under any conditions that Cherchis might propose, in\r\norder that they might devise a scheme for concerted action against the\r\nGovernment, and he reminded him of the proverb which says, “the sheep\r\nwho leaves the flock is torn by the wolf.” Niazi’s friends took him\r\nback to his camp by back lanes and paths, and the band, leaving this\r\ndangerous neighbourhood, made another long night march to the north,\r\nits objective being Dibra on the Black Drin, the centre of a district\r\nin which Niazi knew that he would find many adherents, and where\r\nthe forests and rugged mountains afforded safe retreats and easily\r\ndefensible positions.\r\n\r\nAnd now Niazi’s work of preparing a general insurrection commenced\r\nin earnest. The story of his wanderings cannot be fully told here,\r\nbut I will give some explanation of the methods he employed. It was\r\nhis intention, in the first place, to carry on his operations in the\r\nMoslem villages and afterwards to bring in the other elements of the\r\npopulation. He worked with the greatest energy, often visiting and\r\norganising several villages in the same day. It was his custom to send\r\na small advanced party of his followers under an officer to reassure\r\nthe people, and, this done, he would enter the village with the rest\r\nof the band. In all save a very few Moslem villages thus visited the\r\n_fedais_ were received with extraordinary enthusiasm, and Niazi’s\r\ntask of making the inhabitants sworn adherents of the Committee was\r\nnot difficult. He would call a meeting of the villagers, or, having\r\nattended prayers in the mosque with his band, he would there, after\r\nthe prayers were over, address those present with stirring words,\r\nexplaining to them the lofty aims of the movement whose soldier he now\r\nwas. The leading men would be called up one by one to take the oath\r\nprescribed by the Committee of Union and Progress, and afterwards the\r\nother inhabitants would come up eagerly to be sworn in. Among those who\r\nthus became adherents of the Committee were many deserters from the\r\narmy who had been hiding among their families.\r\n\r\nNiazi used to impress it upon these newly made members that, as they\r\nwere now united as brethren to serve the same high purpose, they must\r\nput away all differences among themselves, and forgive each other for\r\nwrongs inflicted. The cause demanded that their blood feuds should\r\ncease. Throughout this region, and especially in some of the Albanian\r\ndistricts, relentless blood feuds between families and individuals are\r\nvery frequent, and to be murdered in a vendetta is regarded as the\r\nnatural ending to a man’s life. But now was beheld the astonishing\r\nspectacle of a general reconciliation. Men whose families had been\r\nslaughtering each other for generations, embraced publicly, united by\r\ndevotion to a common cause; and old men who had not dared to go outside\r\ntheir houses for years, because some ancient crime was yet unavenged,\r\nonce more went forth freely and without fear.\r\n\r\nThe villagers, in the sincerity of their welcome to Niazi’s _fedais_,\r\nwhom they regarded as the saviours of Turkey, often refused to accept\r\npayment for the food and other necessaries which they freely and gladly\r\nsupplied to the band; but Niazi, when he did not pay in cash for these\r\nsupplies, insisted on giving receipts for their value, and instructed\r\nthe villagers to show their receipts to the authorities and deduct\r\nthe amounts from the taxes which they paid to the Government. At the\r\nsame time he used to send manifestos to the local _mudirs_ and other\r\nofficials warning them that death would be the penalty for the tax\r\ncollector who refused to accept these receipts as part payment of taxes.\r\n\r\nA village, after its inhabitants had been sworn in, was “organised”\r\naccording to certain rules laid down by the Committee, and became a\r\nwell-ordered centre of revolt. In the first place the authority of the\r\nGovernment and its officials was disclaimed, and tyrannical oppression\r\nwas prevented by the united opposition of a population that had become\r\nas a band of brothers. A local form of government on constitutional\r\nlines was set up. The sources of the Government revenue were\r\nappropriated whenever it was possible to do this, and in some districts\r\nthe villages refused to pay any taxes to the Government, offering a\r\npassive resistance that would have taken an active shape had the tax\r\ncollectors ventured to push the matter.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of mutual protection, relations were established\r\nbetween the various villages of a district; and a certain number of the\r\ninhabitants were secretly organised as a sort of militia. Niazi found\r\nthat from one hundred to two hundred and fifty rifles were concealed\r\nin each village of the Dibra and other neighbouring districts, so arms\r\nwere not wanting. These villages had suffered greatly from the raids\r\nof the Bulgarian bands, but from this time the organisation introduced\r\nby Niazi enabled them not only to hold their own against the largest\r\nbands, but to defy the attempts of the Government to coerce them. This\r\ngeneral preparation for defence brought a peace to this region such as\r\nit had not known for years, and the Moslems themselves, obeying the\r\norders of the Committee, refrained from any aggressive actions; all\r\nthe Moslem bands that were in the hills were dissolved, the men who\r\ncomposed them returning to their villages. Niazi made it clear to all\r\nadherents of the Committee that it was above all things necessary for\r\nthe success of the cause that the Moslems should carefully avoid any\r\nconflict, whether with Christian bands or Government troops, and that\r\nthey should act strictly on the defensive until the Committee gave the\r\nword for the general insurrection.\r\n\r\nNiazi thus succeeded, whithersoever he wandered over the Balkans, in\r\nwinning over the Mussulman land-owners and peasantry, and many of\r\nthe Government officials, to the revolutionary cause; and, in the\r\nmeanwhile, by manifestos and letters he sought to gain the confidence\r\nand support of the Bulgarian element in the population. Notwithstanding\r\nthe never-ceasing warfare between them in Macedonia, the Turks and the\r\nbrave and manly Bulgarians were more in touch with each other than\r\nwith any of the other races in the Balkan Peninsula. The Turks had\r\noften protected and were soon again to protect the Bulgarian exarchists\r\nagainst the fanatical persecutions of the Greeks. It was, therefore,\r\nnatural that Niazi should seek the cooperation of the Bulgarians before\r\napproaching the other Christian peoples of European Turkey.\r\n\r\nThere are many Bulgarian villages scattered over the region in which\r\nNiazi was at work, and their inhabitants at first regarded with some\r\nanxiety the change that had come over the Moslem population, which for\r\nseveral years had appeared listless and devoid of hope, not having the\r\nseparatist aspirations which buoyed up the spirits of the Christians,\r\nbut now had suddenly become cheerful and alert, as if looking forward\r\nto some great and happy change. Suspicious at first, the Bulgarians\r\nat last came to realise that whatever sentiment was stirring the\r\nMoslems, it had nothing to do with anti-Christian feeling, and was not\r\nantagonistic to themselves.\r\n\r\nOn July 6 Niazi issued his important manifesto to the Bulgarians. He\r\nproclaimed to them that the time had come to strike a blow at the\r\nevils that had been destroying the fatherland for years, for the\r\nDespotism was ever becoming more intolerable. He put all the blame\r\non the Government; but pointed out that the Christian Ottomans had\r\ntaken a wrong road, while seeking a better state of things. They had\r\nheeded the false advice of the surrounding small states, Bulgaria,\r\nServia, and Greece, which had promised to free Macedonia, but were\r\nreally working for their own ends, their one aim being to seize the\r\ncountry and enslave its people. “These little Powers have sown hatred\r\nand dissension among us, and have deluged the fatherland with blood.”\r\nHe assured them that “if these little Powers should work on thus\r\nfor another thirty years they would not attain their purpose. The\r\nfatherland is, and ever shall be, ours.” He then went on to explain\r\nthat the Ottoman Committee of Union and Progress, consisting of army\r\nofficers, civil officials, townsmen, and peasants, all honourable men,\r\nhad been formed with the object of establishing a system of government\r\nthat would give liberty and justice, without distinction of creed or\r\nrace, to all Ottomans, so that they might live in peace and happiness\r\nin their common fatherland. Then he spoke of his band of armed\r\n_fedais_, whose mission it was to propagate these principles in the\r\ntowns and villages, and to bring about the co-operation of all elements\r\nof the population in putting a stop to the internal dissensions and\r\ncivil warfare that were hastening the Empire to its ruin. He called\r\nupon the leaders to dissolve these mischievous bands, to join his own\r\nband, and work for Ottoman liberty and justice, instead of for Bulgaria\r\nand the other little Powers. Severe punishment would be dealt out to\r\nsuch bands as did not come in, and if any village gave encouragement\r\nto the bands after this warning, its head man would be executed. They\r\nwere all Ottomans, and they must all co-operate to establish the\r\nConstitution which gave equality and liberty, and protected each creed\r\nand race and language.\r\n\r\nThis manifesto produced a wonderful effect. The Bulgarian inhabitants\r\nknew that Niazi Bey was not speaking idle words, and threatening to do\r\nthings that he could not carry out. They realised that if it came to\r\ncivil war the Committee of Union and Progress would have practically\r\nthe entire Moslem population of Macedonia and Albania on its side.\r\nMoreover, they knew enough of Niazi to feel that he was quite sincere\r\nin his declarations and promises, and many of them had observed with\r\namazed admiration the just and honourable conduct of his band of\r\n_fedais_. Here was the Turkish officer who, for five years, had been\r\nvigorously hunting down the Bulgarian bands, now speaking to them as\r\nfellow-countrymen and brethren! Hitherto, they argued, they had paid\r\nheavy taxes to a Government that had given no account of how the money\r\nwas spent, and treated them as dogs; but now a new rule was asserting\r\nitself, under which they began to see justice and the prospect of being\r\ntreated as human beings.\r\n\r\nSo within a few days of the issue of his manifesto, Niazi received\r\nintelligence to the effect that the Bulgarians of Resna, Ochrida,\r\nPersepe, and other districts had held meetings at which it had been\r\ndecided that “it would be an honour to serve with their lives and\r\nproperty this band which had such high aims.” Cherchis himself, too,\r\nwith his comrades, desired to effect a union with the Committee of\r\nUnion and Progress.\r\n\r\nOn July 9 Niazi, thinking that the time was ripe, for the first time\r\nbrought his band into a purely Bulgarian village. This was the large\r\nvillage of Velijon, containing three hundred and fifty houses. It\r\nis situated on a hillside, with a great forest behind it sloping up\r\nsteeply to the wild and lofty ridges of the Balkan Range, and for its\r\nstrategic advantages it had been selected as one of the most important\r\nsupply bases for the Bulgarian bands. As Niazi’s vanguard entered\r\nthe village the inhabitants took alarm, closed their shops, and shut\r\nthemselves up within their houses; but after Niazi, coming in with the\r\nrest of his band, had summoned the Elective Council, and explained\r\nmatters, the fears of the villagers disappeared; and friendly\r\nrelations were soon established by the kindly and courteous officers\r\nand Moslem notables who composed the bulk of this remarkable band. The\r\nend of it was that the priest, the Elective Council, and all the other\r\ninhabitants of the village placed their hands upon the Holy Gospels and\r\ntook the oath of fidelity to the Committee, undertaking to carry out\r\nall its orders and render armed assistance to the cause when called\r\nupon to do so. When the band marched out of the village in the cool of\r\nthe evening the friendly Christians accompanied the _fedais_ for some\r\ndistance to put them on their way and then bade them God speed. Shortly\r\nafter this Niazi was enabled to amnesty and arrange for the coming in\r\nof the bands that were in the hills round Dibra, which place was made\r\nan important centre of the insurrectionary movement.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Niazi received a letter from the Monastir\r\nCentre of the Committee which gave him great encouragement. It thanked\r\nhim and “the heroic self-sacrificing men of Resna” for the splendid\r\nwork they were doing, and informed Niazi that his friend, Major Enver\r\nBey, the clever staff officer who had performed distinguished service\r\nin Macedonia, had thrown up his commission, and at the head of a\r\nband of _fedais_ was actively preparing the population in the Tikosh\r\ndistrict, while other officers had also organised bands, and taken to\r\nthe mountains. The fortunes of the cause appeared very bright.\r\n\r\nHe also learnt from this letter that General Shemshi Pasha had been\r\npublicly assassinated in Monastir on July 7. The General, after\r\nreporting progress to the Palace, had left the telegraph office and\r\nwas driving in his carriage to join the two battalions with which it\r\nwas his intention to surround Niazi’s band, when he was shot dead by\r\nan officer in uniform. Fifteen hundred people were surrounding the\r\ncarriage at the time, but not one attempted to, or had any wish to\r\narrest this executioner of the Committee’s will, who strolled quietly\r\noff. The ill-fated Shemshi was an energetic commander, and had he\r\nlived there would undoubtedly have been some severe fighting between\r\nsuch troops as would have remained loyal to him and the Committee’s\r\nbands. Shemshi would probably have led his troops to disaster, for\r\nhis boldness and confidence in himself amounted to rashness, and he\r\ndespised his enemy. Ambushes had been prepared for him on the roads by\r\nwhich he would have had to march; and Niazi, operating in a difficult\r\nmountain country, with an armed population skilled in guerilla war to\r\nstand by him, was now in a position to hold his own for an indefinite\r\ntime against any forces that the Government could send against him.\r\nThere can be little doubt that the death of Shemshi prevented a civil\r\nwar that would have done much injury to the cause of the Committee,\r\nfor it would have divided public opinion, the unanimity of which it\r\nwas of such importance to secure. From the date of Shemshi’s death the\r\nimpotence of the Government and the disorganisation of the army made\r\nit difficult for the Palace to plunge the country into the horrors of\r\ninternecine conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n_THE PALACE AND THE GREEKS_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the general rising now advanced very rapidly.\r\nEnver Bey, declining further treacherous offers, which included\r\nthe promise of his promotion to General rank if he would return to\r\nConstantinople, led his band of _fedais_ through the mountains, and\r\nwon village after village to the revolutionary cause. The story of\r\nthis young officer’s escape in disguise from Salonica, his adventures\r\nin the wilds, and the brave work he did for Turkey, is told throughout\r\nhis country. He has become the popular hero, and is held in the highest\r\nestimation by his comrades; for the complete absence of any jealousy\r\namong the young officers who devoted themselves to the liberation of\r\ntheir fatherland is a pleasing feature of this patriotic movement.\r\nNiazi writes of Enver as follows: “He who in the time of sorrow and\r\nhopelessness encouraged and fortified us with his ardent words and\r\nserious ways, Enver Bey, whose like is seldom to be met.” Salah-ed-Din\r\nBey, Hassan Bey, and other officers were also wandering over Macedonia\r\nand Albania with their bands, gaining thousands of adherents among\r\nthe land-owners and the peasantry; and at the same time others were\r\neducating the rank and file of the army, with the result that a large\r\nproportion of the troops garrisoning this region were ready to fight,\r\neven against their own comrades, if called upon to do so.\r\n\r\nNiazi Bey had practically won over the bulk of the Moslem inhabitants\r\nof Western Albania, a wonderful achievement indeed. For one who knows\r\nthese fanatical Albanian tribesmen finds it difficult to understand\r\nhow they could listen with sympathy and patience to the gospel of\r\nuniversal brotherhood, and the extension of equal rights to Christian\r\nand Mussulman. But Niazi, with his rough, strong eloquence, his obvious\r\nsincerity and single-mindedness, his magnetic personality, and his\r\ncommanding presence—for, like many Albanians, he is a man of great\r\nstature and sturdy build—is evidently a born leader of men; and he was\r\nsuccessful not only in gaining over the Albanians, but in holding back\r\nthese eager warriors until their armed assistance should be called\r\nfor, and in making them patch up their sanguinary tribal and family\r\nblood feuds, some of which had endured for centuries. Moreover, a\r\nlarge proportion of the young officers of the Third Army Corps were\r\nof Albanian stock, and of these several were able to influence their\r\ncountrymen in the Committee’s favour.\r\n\r\nNiazi and his band, during their memorable twenty days’ wandering in\r\nthe hill-country, avoiding the main roads and threading in single\r\nfile the difficult mountain tracks, ran many dangers and suffered\r\nconsiderable hardships. At times the pursuing Government troops were\r\nclose at their heels; sometimes, but not often, the _fedais_ came\r\nto a village whose inhabitants were hostile. Thus, on one occasion,\r\nwhen hungry, thirsty, and weary they approached a village in order\r\nto obtain the bread and cheese and water which seem to have composed\r\ntheir usual diet, the villagers, whose minds had been poisoned against\r\nthe Committee by an emissary of the Palace, came out armed to the\r\nteeth, and dangerously excited, and threatened to fire upon the band.\r\nThe position was an awkward one, for Niazi not only had the hostile\r\nvillage in front of him, but had in his rear, and not far off, a large\r\ndetachment of troops under a Bosnian officer, which had been sent to\r\ncut him off. So the band, foodless and worn out with fatigue, had\r\nto take to the upper slopes of the mountain for safety. Niazi is an\r\nobstinate man. He was determined either to convert that village to\r\nthe cause or to give it a severe lesson. A few days later he talked\r\nthe villagers over to repentance of their error; they took the oath\r\nof allegiance to the Committee, and supplied the band with two days’\r\nrations of bread and cheese, for which they refused to accept payment.\r\nMoreover, the Bosnian officer, on receiving the news of Shemshi Pasha’s\r\nexecution at Monastir, abandoned his pursuit of Niazi and marched with\r\nhis band to Ochrida to submit to the Committee.\r\n\r\nOn July 12 Niazi, having been summoned to Ochrida to confer with the\r\nCommittee, marched boldly into that town with his band, none daring\r\nto interfere with him, so much had the authority of the Government\r\nbeen weakened by this time. Here the members of the Committee gave him\r\ninformation concerning the other bands, and instructed him to keep\r\nin touch with them, as the time was near when an important combined\r\nmovement might be made. They told him that the Government had sent\r\nGeneral Osman Pasha to Monastir as Commander Extraordinary of the\r\nVilayet, in the place of the assassinated Shemshi Pasha, and that\r\nthe Bulgarian Executive Committee had issued instructions to all the\r\nBulgarian villages to the effect that the Moslem revolutionary bands\r\nshould be treated hospitably and with consideration, but that, until\r\nfurther orders, armed assistance must not be given. Niazi was also\r\ninformed of the shooting, by order of the Committee, of the _imam_,\r\nMustapha Effendi, and other dangerous agents of the Palace.\r\n\r\nThe business completed, Niazi’s band marched out of the town, and\r\nfollowed the sandy shores of the great lake of Ochrida, where they\r\nwere warmly welcomed in the villages of the Bulgarian fishing-folk.\r\nThe objective of the band was Istarova, but on the way they\r\ncarried out their mission in the villages, swearing in the people,\r\noverthrowing the authority of the Government, establishing elective\r\nadministrative bodies, and expelling any tax-gatherers or other\r\nservants of the Government who had oppressed the people, or were known\r\nto be subservient to Palace influence. Threatened at one point by a\r\npursuing detachment of four hundred men, Niazi divided his band into\r\nsmall parties and took up commanding positions on the rocky hills that\r\nbordered the main road. But it turned out that the detachment was under\r\nthe command of Captain Ziya Bey, a young officer whose sympathies were\r\nwith the revolutionaries. Ziya Bey and some other officers came up\r\nto Niazi’s camp, offered to join the band so soon as their services\r\nshould be needed, and undertook to withdraw the detachment from the\r\nneighbourhood. There was another detachment, too, in pursuit of the\r\nband at that time, but it had purposely been sent off in a wrong\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIt was Niazi’s intention to make Istarova, the centre of an important\r\ndistrict, his head-quarters for a short while. His band made a\r\ntriumphal progress through the district. The villagers were all eager\r\nto be sworn as adherents of the Committee. In one village Niazi ordered\r\nthe execution of a particularly iniquitous tax-gatherer (who succeeded\r\nin effecting his escape) and the man’s rams were divided among the\r\nmembers of the band, who were thus enabled to enjoy a luxurious\r\nmeal for a change. Before entering Istarova, Niazi sent a letter to\r\nthe principal Government official in the place, the _kaimakan_ (or\r\nadministrator, of the _Caza_, or district of Istarova), an honourable\r\nyoung man who had exercised his authority with justice, and of whom\r\nthe peasants in the district had spoken well to Niazi. It was a\r\ncharacteristic letter, in which Niazi, after explaining that all the\r\ninhabitants of the district, Moslem and Christian, had sworn to stand\r\nby the Committee, told him that though he entertained a great esteem\r\nfor him as a just ruler of the people, at the same time he, Niazi,\r\nregretted that the _kaimakan_ had shown negligence in one important\r\nparticular; for in that large district there was not a single school.\r\n“The calamities of this nation,” he went on, “are mainly due to the\r\nignorance of the people,” and he urged him to do his best to promote\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nOn July 16 the band entered Istarova, where the men enjoyed a welcome\r\nand much-needed rest—the villagers supplying cigars and coffee to\r\ncheer them—and were able to sleep in unwonted security, surrounded\r\nby their friends; for in that district of a hundred villages, with a\r\npopulation of 30,000, all men were with the Committee of Union and\r\nProgress, while any troops that might have proved troublesome had been\r\nremoved to a distance by arrangement with friendly officers. As for\r\nNiazi, he saw to the swearing in of the people of Istarova, and the\r\nelection of the administrative body, and then he preached the gospel\r\nof the Constitution in the Mosque, and recommended the newly appointed\r\nadministrative body to build schools, to educate the people, and to\r\nrepair their mosques, and for this purpose, on behalf of his band,\r\nhe subscribed the sum of two pounds. The _kaimakan_ himself sought\r\nout Niazi in the night, and praised him to his face as a brave man\r\nand a bringer of justice to the people, declared his belief in the\r\nrighteousness of the Committee’s aim, and placed himself under Niazi’s\r\norders. Thus did Niazi influence all the men with whom he came into\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nThroughout the following day Niazi remained in Istarova, which\r\npresented a very animated appearance, for there poured into the village\r\nthousands of peasants from all the surrounding countryside, eager to\r\nbe sworn, together with a number of soldiers who had deserted to join\r\nNiazi, and had come in, bringing their rifles with them, from the\r\nneighbouring garrisons and posts. There was good reason for Niazi’s\r\nexultation in the success of the movement. Resna, Ochrida, Persepe,\r\nDibra, Malisa, and now Istarova had all been brought within the\r\nrevolutionary union by the efforts of the bands. He now knew that with\r\na word, when the time came, he would be able to summon a large armed\r\nforce to execute the Committee’s will.\r\n\r\nAnd now to leave the mountains and the bands of brave _fedais_ for\r\na while, to return to the less wholesome atmosphere of the Yildiz\r\nPalace, and follow the last vain efforts of the Despotism to crush the\r\nlife out of the revolutionary movement. The advisers of the Sultan\r\nwere fully aware of the significance of the reports that came to them\r\nfrom Macedonia, though the newspapers, officially inspired, still\r\nspoke lightly of “unimportant manifestations of disaffection in a\r\nfew garrisons.” There were high Government officials in the European\r\nVilayets who ventured to inform the Palace of the exact state of\r\naffairs. Notable among these was the Vali of Monastir, who in the\r\nfollowing despatch to the Grand Vizier (dated, I think, July 17)\r\npointed out, as plainly as he dared, that the revolutionary movement\r\nwas too strong for the Despotism, that further repressive measures must\r\nfail, and could only result in useless bloodshed, and that it would be\r\nwell to submit to the will of the people and grant a Constitution. The\r\nlast suggestion was, of course, put in an ambiguous way, for at that\r\ntime no one had the courage to mention the word Constitution to the\r\nSultan. The following is a translation—some repetitions and unimportant\r\ndetails being omitted—of the despatch in question.\r\n\r\n\r\n“It has been ordered by an Imperial _Iradé_ that Niazi Bey and his\r\ncompanions should be arrested. The existence of the powerful Committee\r\nof Union and Progress has been proved by the severity of the measures\r\nwhich it adopts. It stands not alone; for, as has already been\r\nintimated in official despatches, the officers of the army are united\r\nin a determination to support the demands of the Committee; and the\r\npopulation, likewise, is in league with the Committee. To leave aside\r\nthe question of the pursuit of Niazi, I beg to state that none will now\r\nventure to undertake the duty of making investigations. The members\r\nof the commission which was formed under the presidency of Shukri\r\nPasha to institute inquiries (the spy commission) have been obliged to\r\nabandon their work in consequence of the secret threats which were\r\nconveyed to them. The _ulema_ who were sent by the Government to travel\r\nthrough the country and give advice to the villagers have been warned\r\nby the Committee of Union and Progress that they would be killed if\r\nthey continued to do this, so they have returned. The lives of all\r\nofficials, my own included, are in peril. It has been shown that the\r\nCommittee has the power of executing its threats. Here, in Monastir,\r\nwhen General Osman Hidayet Pasha had gathered his officers around him\r\nto read to them the telegram which communicated the high _Iradé_ of his\r\nImperial Majesty the Caliph, he was shot by one of the officers, who\r\nfired three times at him in the presence of all these people, and yet\r\nthis officer was not arrested, and it has been found impossible even to\r\nascertain his name. The police and judiciary officials are meditating\r\nresignation from their posts in order to save their lives if pressure\r\nis brought upon them to make them carry out their duties. As for me,\r\nyour servant, my ancestry having been faithful for four hundred years,\r\nand myself having served the Government in various capacities for the\r\nlast forty-four years, I consider that for me to resign my post in\r\nthis hour of trouble would be an act of ingratitude; and therefore,\r\ndespite the perils to which I and my family are exposed, I am prepared\r\nto discharge my duty, that is, to devise means preventing the active\r\nco-operation of the people with the officers of the army, whose views\r\nand aims they undoubtedly share.\r\n\r\n“At the same time I consider it a duty and a proof of my loyalty that I\r\nshould submit to you in detail the true facts of the situation. I must\r\ninform you that the sentiments of which I am speaking are now acquiring\r\na strong hold upon the private soldiers. The six battalions which were\r\nsent to Resna now remain there inactive, and their commanders confess\r\ntheir powerlessness. Should any attempt be made to pursue Niazi, the\r\nsoldiers will refuse to fire upon him and his band. I may mention in\r\nproof of this that when General Shemshi Pasha was assassinated here,\r\nthe men of his Albanian body-guard, the _gendarmes_, and the other\r\nsoldiers present, when pursuing the criminal in accordance with the\r\norders given to them, discharged their rifles in the air and allowed\r\nthe assassin to escape. According to private information which I have\r\nreceived it is believed that the troops who are to be despatched\r\nfrom Anatolia will, on their arrival here, refuse to use their arms\r\nagainst their comrades. What I have stated concerning the condition of\r\nthis region is applicable also, so I am informed, to the Vilayets of\r\nSalonica and Kosovo.\r\n\r\n“The urgency of this matter and the fact that this movement is daily\r\ngaining strength and spreading with extraordinary rapidity being taken\r\ninto consideration by the Government, I submit, prompted by my loyalty,\r\nthat the time for either measures of persuasion or those of force and\r\nseverity have passed, and that, in order to obviate a still worse state\r\nof things, other more effective measures, more consonant with the\r\ntimes, should be adopted. I am awaiting your commands.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Palace was to crush the revolt with a great force of\r\ntroops from Anatolia; but as straightforward methods by themselves\r\nnever sufficed the Sultan’s advisers, underground devices were also\r\nemployed. The Greek element in Macedonia on previous occasions had\r\nbeen found willing to join hands with the Turkish Government in the\r\nsuppression of Bulgarian rebellions, so Munir Pasha, who had for some\r\nyears been the Turkish Ambassador in Paris, was now sent to Athens to\r\narrange for the organisation of Greek bands to attack the Moslem and\r\nChristian supporters of the Committee of Union and Progress. The Palace\r\nalso attempted, by offers of full pardons, gifts, and promotions, to\r\nwithdraw army officers from the revolutionary movement, and so leave\r\nthe disorganised followers of the Committee of Union and Progress an\r\neasy prey for the forces that were to be brought against them. The\r\nthirty-eight young officers who had been arrested in Salonica and\r\nwere imprisoned in the capital were released and pardoned. Thousands\r\nof officers in the army and navy were astonished to find themselves\r\nsuddenly promoted, and decorations were distributed wholesale. The\r\nPalace entertained the foolish belief that every man has his price; but\r\nall this hypocritical benevolence was of no avail and only served to\r\nlay bare to the world the incompetence and panic of the Camarilla in\r\nthe hour of danger.\r\n\r\nIt was decided to despatch no less than forty-eight battalions from\r\nAnatolia to overpower the disaffected Macedonian army, and had these\r\nAsiatic troops proved staunch there would have been a terrible shedding\r\nof blood. Twenty-seven of these battalions were transported by sea from\r\nSmyrna to Salonica, where they disembarked on July 16. The efforts of\r\nDr. Nazim Bey and other agents of the Young Turk party had already,\r\nto a large extent, inoculated these troops with the revolutionary\r\ndoctrines before they left Asia Minor, and from the moment of their\r\nembarkation at Smyrna the emissaries of the Committee were at\r\nwork among them, testing the officers to find out who were of the\r\nrevolutionary party and using persuasive arguments with the rank and\r\nfile. Some of the regiments on reaching Salonica refused to proceed to\r\nMonastir and were isolated from the rest. The remaining regiments were\r\nmarched to Monastir, and with them went officers who were initiates of\r\nthe secret society, disguised as sherbet sellers, _mollahs_, and so\r\nforth, ever winning over adherents to the cause. It soon became clear\r\nthat the bulk of the officers and men of this force were in sympathy\r\nwith the troops whom they had been sent to slaughter, and that they\r\nwould never fire upon their comrades of the Third Army Corps. These\r\nbattalions that entered Monastir were soon persuaded to take the oath\r\nof allegiance to the Committee of Union and Progress.\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs in the third week in July may therefore be summed\r\nup as follows: The Government still nominally ruled and administered\r\nthe three Vilayets of Monastir, Salonica, and Kosovo, but its authority\r\nhad been reduced to impotence. In the chief military centre, Monastir,\r\nGeneral Osman Pasha was in command, but, knowing the temper of his men,\r\nhesitated to attempt decisive action to crush the insurrection. The\r\nmen of the Second and Third Army Corps, and of the regiments that had\r\nbeen brought from Anatolia, were either adherents of the Committee or\r\nwavering in their allegiance to the Government. It was unlikely that\r\nmore than a small proportion of the troops would be found willing to\r\nfight the battles of the Palace. The Moslem and Bulgarian peasants,\r\namong whom arms had been distributed by the Committee of Union and\r\nProgress, were awaiting the word to take part in the general rising.\r\nTen thousand Albanian warriors were in arms, eager to fall upon the\r\nsupporters of the Despotism.\r\n\r\nThe one doubtful element of the population was the Greek. It appears\r\nthat the Palace had not only sent Munir Pasha to Athens to seek the\r\nassistance of those intriguing subjects of King George who used to\r\nequip the brigand bands that had been the curse of Macedonia; but\r\nit also issued instructions to General Osman Pasha in Monastir to\r\npersuade the Greek bands within his district, by means of what bribes\r\nor promises I cannot say, to hunt down and capture Niazi and the other\r\nleaders of the insurrection. It is undoubtedly the fact that the Greek\r\nbands, assisted by hired Mussulman desperadoes, were displaying great\r\nactivity at this period, and that the Greek clergy were directing a\r\nvigorous persecution of the Bulgarian exarchists. The Committee of\r\nUnion and Progress dealt firmly with this one disturbing element in\r\nan otherwise peaceful and united country. For example, the Committee\r\ncarried away the Greek Bishop of Vodena as a hostage and let it be\r\nknown that he would be put to death in three days unless by that time\r\nall the bands in that neighbourhood had been broken up.\r\n\r\nOn July 22, by which time, as I shall show, the young Turk leaders had\r\ncome boldly into the open to demand from the Sultan his abdication or a\r\nConstitution, the Committee of Union and Progress in Monastir issued a\r\nmanifesto, of which copies were sent to the Greek Committee in Athens,\r\nthe spiritual head of the Greek community in Monastir, and to the\r\nchiefs of the various Greek bands in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThis manifesto, after stating that “the Yildiz, in opposition to the\r\nwill of the people, had attempted to bring about a diversion against\r\nthe Young Turk movement by effecting a union between the Hellenes and\r\nthe Patriarchate, and with that object had sent Munir Pasha to stir\r\nup feeling in Greece against the Committee, and that this scheme had\r\nbeen attended with some success,” proceeded as follows: “You know\r\nthat our Committee of Union and Progress, having worked in secret for\r\nthe welfare of all races and creeds in Turkey, has now come forth to\r\nopenly proclaim its aim—the winning of liberty for the nation. The\r\ntyrannical Government has sown the seeds of sedition and has brought\r\nabout conflicts and bloodshed between the various races and creeds in\r\nthe land. We being all brothers, working together for the salvation\r\nand happiness of the country, ask of you, our Greek fellow-countrymen,\r\nthat you no longer use differences of race and creed as an excuse for\r\nthe shedding of blood. If your real object is to obtain equality,\r\nwell-being, and liberty, be with us and seek no outside advice; be even\r\nas our Bulgarian brothers, who by their sincerity and by their deeds\r\nhave proved their sympathy for our high aims. If you will not unite\r\nwith us, we ask of you at least to remain neutral, and we call upon you\r\nin the name of humanity to cease this shedding of blood. We warn you\r\nagainst the dangers of Hellenism. If you Greeks in the Monastir Vilayet\r\ndo not put a stop to your Hellenic agitation, your brother Greeks in\r\nAnatolia, who are much more numerous than yourselves, will suffer as\r\nwell as yourselves. Secret negotiations between the Yildiz and the\r\nPatriarchate will lead, not to your happiness, but to your injury and\r\ndestruction. We advise our Greek brothers not to be deceived by these\r\nshameless artifices which the Yildiz has oftentimes practised. We ask\r\nthat the Greek bands should no longer go hither and thither shedding\r\nblood in their mistaken racial and religious zeal. Let the Hellenes\r\namong them return to their homes in Greece. Let them scatter. It is\r\nalso intolerable to us that these bands have low Moslems in their pay\r\nwho commit atrocities. We will find out and kill these Moslems if\r\nthey do not at once abandon the Greek bands. We call upon you to have\r\nthese Moslems sent away, else with you will be the responsibility\r\nfor the blood that will be shed, and you will be condemned by the\r\ncivilised world. With much affection we invite our Greek compatriots to\r\nunite with us in striving for our main objects—the restoration of our\r\nConstitution and the gaining of equality for all. We cannot doubt that\r\nGod, who has created us all, will grant success to those only who work\r\nfor humanity and civilisation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n_A BLOODLESS VICTORY_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now the hour was drawing near when Niazi was to be called upon to\r\ndo the deed that would bring the insurrection to a head and send the\r\nDespotism tumbling down like a house of cards. Leaving Istarova on July\r\n17, Niazi and his band of _fedais_ set out for Resna. After a fatiguing\r\nmarch across the mountains (in the course of which the provisional\r\nadministration was introduced into several friendly Moslem and\r\nChristian villages, and some _détours_ had to be made in order to avoid\r\ncollision with a battalion of _chasseurs_, whose officers and men,\r\nbeing strangers to the country and not members of the Committee, were\r\nlikely to be dangerous) the band entered Labcha, the first village, it\r\nwill be remembered, that Niazi had visited and organised on the day of\r\nhis setting out from Resna. Here, as in Istarova, the _fedais_ were\r\namong staunch friends and were enabled to sleep in security; there was\r\nno necessity for sending out patrols or for posting sentries, for these\r\nduties were performed by the villagers themselves, who were proud to\r\nguard the saviours of the nation as they rested. The village was also\r\nprotected by a detachment of troops which, like many another little\r\ngarrison in the three Vilayets, had mutinied, its officers and men\r\nbecoming the sworn associates of the Committee.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, July 19, there was a great gathering of people\r\nin Labcha, wild hillmen, shepherds, deserters from the army, and\r\nothers, who had come in to see Niazi and his band and to declare their\r\nreadiness to take up arms for the Committee. Niazi addressed the\r\npeople, told them how successful had been the mission of his own and\r\nof the other bands, and assured them that the sand had all but run out\r\nof the glass, and the day was very near when the Despotism would fall\r\nand liberty prevail. That glad day was indeed nearer than Niazi himself\r\nimagined; for that very evening there came a messenger into the village\r\nwith a letter for Niazi from the Ochrida Centre of the Committee of\r\nUnion and Progress. In this letter the Committee informed him that very\r\nimportant and grave intelligence had been received from Monastir, and\r\nordered him to set out at once for Ochrida. He was to leave his band\r\noutside that town and come in alone to confer with the Committee and\r\nreceive his instructions.\r\n\r\nSo soon as Niazi had read this letter he collected his men and made\r\na forced march throughout the night, for all were eager to learn the\r\nnature of the duty which they were to be called upon to perform. Before\r\ndawn—July 20—the outskirts of Ochrida were reached, and Niazi, leaving\r\nhis band, entered the town and went to the house of his brother, where\r\nthe members of the Committee came to meet him. It was then explained\r\nto him that he and Eyoub Bey were to collect two thousand men from\r\nOchrida and Resna, form them into two bands, and march on Monastir\r\nwithout delay. The detailed instructions as to what he was to do would\r\nbe delivered to him before he reached that town.\r\n\r\nAs Niazi learnt later, the Committee of Union and Progress had decided\r\nthat the time had arrived for it to make its great _coup_. The plan\r\nwas simultaneously to proclaim the Constitution at Monastir and\r\nsend an ultimatum to the Sultan, who would have to choose between\r\nconstitutional government, abdication, and a bloody civil war. In the\r\nfirst place it was necessary for the Committee to secure the possession\r\nof Monastir, the head-quarters of the Government’s military strength\r\nin Macedonia, where General Osman Pasha, an able man who exercised\r\na greater moral influence over his troops than did his predecessor,\r\nShemshi Pasha, was still in command. The bulk of the troops in Monastir\r\nwere adherents of the Committee, but there were also many ready to\r\nobey the orders of the General. It was realised that if Osman Pasha\r\ncould be got out of the way the supporters of the Government would be\r\ndemoralised, and the Committee might then be able to establish its\r\nauthority without bloodshed. The killing of each other by Turkey’s\r\nMoslem soldiers was a calamity to be avoided. It was therefore decided\r\nto entrust to Niazi and Eyoub Beys the special duty of removing Osman\r\nPasha from Monastir as suddenly and quietly as possible, so as to allow\r\nno time for the organisation of opposition.\r\n\r\nTo collect the necessary two thousand men was no difficult matter.\r\nIn the first place it was decided to employ the very troops who had\r\nbeen the first to pursue Niazi and his band after the raising of the\r\nstandard of revolt at Resna. This was a battalion of _redifs_ of the\r\nOchrida district which had been disbanded after its fruitless chase of\r\nthe revolutionary leader, because the authorities rightly suspected\r\nthat most of the men were adherents of the Committee of Union and\r\nProgress. So messengers were sent to the neighbouring villages to\r\nsummon these disbanded soldiers—who had not yet given up their arms to\r\nthe Government—to assemble at an appointed place outside Ochrida. Niazi\r\nwith his band marched into his own country to collect the men of Resna,\r\nPersepe, and Labcha. Throughout the night of the 20th and throughout\r\nthe following day he traversed the mountainous countryside, his band\r\nbeing ever increased by the accession of fresh volunteers who came\r\nto him generally in threes and fours, but occasionally in bodies of\r\nfrom forty to fifty men. Whenever the band passed through a village it\r\nwas received with extraordinary enthusiasm, and the villagers brought\r\npresents of bread and cheese until each man was provided with two days’\r\nrations, the supply which Niazi deemed to be necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the morning of July 21 Eyoub Effendi, with his Ochrida band of\r\ndisbanded _redifs_ and others, a thousand men in all, joined Niazi’s\r\nband at Labcha, and now the column formed by the two united bands set\r\noff in the direction of Monastir. After dark, as they were approaching\r\ntheir appointed night’s halting place, an incident occurred which\r\nis interesting as illustrating the manners and customs of the wild\r\nAlbanian hillmen. The stillness of the night was suddenly broken by\r\nthe sound of rifle-fire on the mountainside above the road; so Niazi\r\nsent out scouts to ascertain what was happening. It turned out that the\r\nFaragas and the Quapris, between which two tribes there had existed for\r\nages a deadly blood feud, had each sent a band of about one hundred men\r\nto join Eyoub Bey’s battalion; these two bands met in the mountain,\r\nand what happened may be best described in Niazi’s own words: “It was\r\nindeed a sight worth witnessing—this meeting of the men of these two\r\ntribes, between whom there had been so intense an enmity, but who were\r\nnow united, as with one heart, ready to die together for the sake of\r\nthe same ideal. These tribesmen, who for two centuries had hated to\r\nsee each other’s faces or to hear each other’s voices, and who had\r\never pursued each other with rifle-shots, had now, on meeting on the\r\nhillside, saluted each other with rifle-shots, and were eager, standing\r\ntogether as comrades, to use rifle-shots against the traitors and\r\nenemies of the fatherland.”\r\n\r\nThe column passed the night in the village of Gauchar, where many\r\nvolunteers from the surrounding country joined the battalions of Niazi\r\nand Eyoub, bringing the force up to the strength of over two thousand\r\nmen. The people gathered from the countryside to crowd the village\r\nstreets throughout the night to honour and entertain the _fedais_ with\r\nsimple refreshments. All these people were prepared to risk everything\r\nin the civil war, the immediate outbreak of which they considered as\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, July 22, the column marched under a blazing\r\nsun by the steep zigzag tracks that cross the precipitous ranges of\r\nMount Pelista. At ten o’clock a halt was made, and the “National\r\nBattalion of Ochrida” under Eyoub Bey, and the “National Battalion\r\nof Resna” under Niazi Bey, were arranged in their roll-call order.\r\nThere were twenty companies or bands in all, under twenty commanders,\r\nwho included among them one lieutenant-colonel, several majors and\r\ncaptains, one doctor of medicine, and leading Beys of the Macedonian\r\nand Albanian land-owning class. Up to that moment these National\r\ntroops had not been informed of their destination or of the object of\r\nthe expedition. So now, while Eyoub enlightened his battalion, Niazi\r\naddressed the men of his own command. He explained how, in order to\r\nserve the beneficent Committee which was working for the salvation of\r\nthe country, the men of his band had cheerfully given up comfort, and\r\ntheir wives and families, and had been ready to sacrifice their lives.\r\n“But now,” he said, “these hardships and troubles will soon be a thing\r\nof the past, and they have achieved their purpose well. Relying upon\r\nthe success which God gives and the inspiration of the Prophet, we are\r\nnow on our way to the head-quarters of the Vilayet of Monastir to carry\r\ninto execution a most important command of the Committee. Within a\r\nfew hours, if we are successful, we shall have delivered our country\r\nfrom its afflictions. Without hurting a hair of his head we shall\r\ntake the Mushir (Field Marshal), Osman Pasha, from his residence so\r\nas to prevent him from carrying into effect the injuries which it is\r\nin his mind to inflict upon the Committee and the fatherland. May God\r\nenable us to perform this duty with complete success. It is therefore\r\nnecessary, my comrades, that you should carry out the orders which\r\nyou will receive, literally and implicitly. The strictest order and\r\ndiscipline must be maintained.”\r\n\r\nThe men rejoiced to hear what they were called upon to do, and, despite\r\ntheir fatigue, when the order to resume the march was given, they\r\nproceeded along the rough roads at the double, eager to reach Monastir\r\nas soon as possible. While the column was on its way, there came to\r\nit a most acceptable mascot in the shape of a young roebuck. It was\r\naccompanying a half-dozen or so of _bashi-bazouks_, who had with them\r\na letter from the Committee at Monastir ordering that they should be\r\nadmitted into Niazi’s band. They had found the roebuck in the hills,\r\nand as all Turks, even if they be savage _bashi-bazouks_, are fond of\r\nanimals and are invariably kind to them, they caressed the creature and\r\ngained its confidence so well that it had followed them along the road.\r\nSo this roebuck now became the pet of the column and marched at the\r\nhead of it, fulfilling, says Niazi, the function of a guide, “for by\r\nsome instinct it always ran on in the direction we had to go.” Niazi’s\r\ndescription of this incident well illustrates the kindly and religious\r\nsentiment of the Turks. “The soldiers,” he tells us, “caressed and\r\nblessed it, and thanked God who had sent us this beautiful animal,\r\nwhich fascinated all with its charming ways. We regarded its presence\r\nas a propitious sign, a divine message of approval of our enterprise.”\r\n\r\nIn the evening, the column, after an extraordinary forced march,\r\nreached a village which was within a few miles of Monastir. A halt was\r\ncalled so that the men could have a meal and rest; and here, as had\r\nbeen arranged, there arrived from Monastir Lieutenant Osman Effendi\r\nwith fifty men, bringing a sealed letter for Niazi which contained\r\nthe Committee’s detailed instructions for the execution of the plan.\r\nOnce more Niazi impressed the necessity of silence, steadiness, and\r\nobedience on the men; the order was given to march, and the eager\r\n_fedais_ hurried along the road, sandal-shod, and therefore almost\r\nnoiselessly, at the double, and covered the few miles that lay between\r\nthem and their destination in a very short time. It was about eleven\r\no’clock at night, and there were but few citizens in the streets,\r\nwhen the column came to the outskirts of Monastir. Here the main body\r\nremained while eight hundred men, divided into several detachments,\r\nand guided by members of the Monastir Committee, passed into the town\r\nby various routes and quickly and silently approached and surrounded\r\nthe group of buildings which contained the Government House, the\r\nHeadquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, and the official residence\r\nof General Osman Pasha. At the same time agents of the Committee cut\r\nthe telegraph wires and so prevented the General from holding any\r\ncommunication with the Yildiz or with his own staff. The sentries\r\nguarding the General’s residence were quickly disarmed; only one man\r\noffered resistance, but he was pinioned before he could fire his rifle\r\nand give the alarm. Then two officers and some of the men of Niazi’s\r\nband broke into the room where the General was in bed sleeping, and\r\nhe was awakened, not unnaturally furiously angry, to find himself the\r\nprisoner of the revolutionaries. In the meanwhile other bodies of men\r\ndiscovered and placed under arrest the Chief of the Staff, the Officer\r\nin Command of the Zone, and some other officers who were known to be no\r\nfriends of the Committee of Union and Progress.\r\n\r\nHis captors assured Osman Pasha that his life was in no danger, but,\r\nwhile addressing him with all the respect due to his high rank, they\r\ncourteously explained to him that their instructions were to escort\r\nhim with all marks of honour to Resna, where he was to remain for a\r\nshort time as the guest of the Committee of Union and Progress. Then\r\nthey handed him a letter which had been drawn up by the Committee.\r\nIt opened with the correct ceremonial salutations: “In the name of\r\nthe most merciful and compassionate God. To His Excellency, Mushir,\r\nOsman Pasha. Peace be on you and the mercy of God. May God guide us\r\nand you.” Then the letter proceeded—in terms so polite and flattering\r\nthat one wonders whether the Committee was indulging in sarcasm—to\r\npoint out that the courage and ability with which God had endowed His\r\nExcellency ought to be used to direct armies to crush the enemies\r\nof the fatherland, and not to attack the nation itself; but that,\r\nunfortunately, His Excellency’s official appointment and the extensive\r\npowers and instructions that had been given to him by the Yildiz were\r\ncalculated to induce him—no doubt against the dictates of his own\r\nconscience—to commit acts that might be injurious to the fatherland and\r\ncause the repetition of such regrettable events as occurred in Erzeroum\r\n(the Armenian massacres). His Excellency’s life, the letter explained,\r\nwas precious to the country; when the Despotism had been changed for\r\nconstitutional government his services might be required for the reform\r\nand reorganisation of the army. Consequently the Committee proposed to\r\nrescue His Excellency from his present awkward situation, and ventured\r\nto beg him to consent to become the Committee’s honoured guest; it\r\ntrusted that he would not regard this as in any way bringing disgrace\r\nupon himself, and assured him that everything had been arranged that\r\ncould safeguard his dignity and contribute to his comfort. It reminded\r\nhim that opposition to the Committee’s will could not avail, for his\r\nhouse was surrounded, all officers on whose obedience he could rely\r\nwere under arrest, while the troops in the town and all the inhabitants\r\nwere adherents of the Committee.\r\n\r\nOsman Pasha read this document without making any comment upon its\r\ncontents, and asked whether he might go into the adjoining room to put\r\non his clothes; but the two officers, fearing lest he might attempt\r\nsuicide, were present while he dressed. Then the General left the house\r\nand, mounting a horse, was escorted by Niazi and his National Battalion\r\nof one thousand men to Resna, which was reached the following night,\r\nand here Osman was confined as an honoured prisoner in the house of one\r\nof the notables of the place.\r\n\r\nOn that day, July 23, Macedonia and Albania threw off the Despotism,\r\nand even as Niazi’s men were marching to Resna with their prisoner\r\nthey heard behind them, far off, the sound of the cannon in Monastir\r\nthat were saluting the Constitution. Niazi and his _fedais_ had sworn\r\nnot to return to their homes until their country had won its freedom,\r\nand now, having faithfully observed their oaths, he and many of his\r\nfollowers rejoined their rejoicing wives and families in Resna.\r\nThroughout the following day, July 24, Resna, like every other town and\r\nvillage in Turkey, presented an extraordinary spectacle. The people\r\nseemed to be mad with enthusiasm and delight. Turks, Bulgarians,\r\nGreeks, Servians, Wallachs were all as brothers. Several Bulgarian\r\nand Greek bands, one of the former led by the redoubtable Cherchis\r\nhimself, tramped into Resna that day to take part in the universal\r\njollification and fraternisation. Banners bearing the device, “Liberty,\r\nEquality, Fraternity, Justice,” and national flags innumerable waved\r\nin the breeze, and all day long the people were shouting themselves\r\nhoarse with cries of “Long live the Nation!” “Long live the Army!”\r\n“Long live the Committee!” After a twenty-four hours’ halt in Resna,\r\nduring which he was occupied in receiving the Christian band leaders\r\nand administering the oath to them, and making arrangements in case of\r\na _levée en masse_ of the people (for it was uncertain yet whether the\r\nSultan would submit or plunge the country into civil war), Niazi, by\r\norder of the Committee, marched back to Monastir with the two hundred\r\noriginal _fedais_ of his band, accompanied by Cherchis and other\r\nleaders of the Christian bands.\r\n\r\nAnd here Niazi passes out of this story. I have given a somewhat\r\nfull account of his wanderings, as the narrative will make clear\r\nthe nature of the work that was done all over the country by those\r\nwhose mission it was to gain the adherence of the civil population\r\nto the revolutionary cause; and I think that it also shows that\r\nthose virtues without which no people can be great or worthy of any\r\nrespect—patriotism, and the readiness to sacrifice self for a high\r\nideal—are possessed in a high degree by the Moslem Turks. Niazi was\r\nthe first young officer to take to the mountains, and it was to his\r\nlot that the most important work fell; but it needed many others like\r\nhim to make the insurrection so universal as it was. Enver Bey and\r\ndozens of other young officers were doing the same work as Niazi and\r\nwith like success in other parts of the country. The local Committees,\r\ntoo, appear to have been wonderfully organised and to have been\r\ndirected by single-minded patriots of great ability who kept ever in\r\nthe background, their names unknown, and took no part in the public\r\nrejoicings when the victory was won. Thus the Committees in Uskeb\r\nand Janina, by their diligent propaganda, respectively won over the\r\nallegiance of the Northern Albanians and the Southern Albanians at\r\nthe same time that Niazi was gaining that of the Western Albanians.\r\nNiazi is essentially the soldier, simple and straightforward and not\r\na politician, and, now that his mission at the time of his country’s\r\nperil has been successfully accomplished, he is back in his own\r\nprovince quietly fulfilling his military duties in the midst of troops\r\nwho would follow him to hell, as our own private soldiers would put it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n_THE COMMITTEE’S ULTIMATUM_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the night of July 22, so soon as Osman Pasha had been made a\r\nprisoner, the members of the Monastir Centre of the Committee of Union\r\nand Progress proceeded to take over the government of the city and\r\nto secure the position that had been gained by Niazi’s _coup_. In\r\nthe first place, the Committee sent a telegram to the Sultan himself\r\n(to the Presence of His Sacred Majesty, the Caliph), beseeching him\r\nto command the practical application of the Fundamental Law (the\r\nConstitution of 1876) in order that the loyalty and devotion of his\r\nsubjects might remain unimpaired; and informing him that, unless an\r\n_Iradé_ ordering the opening of the Chamber of Deputies was issued\r\nby the following Sunday—July 26—events would “occur contrary to your\r\nRoyal will and pleasure.” The telegram concluded with the words: “The\r\ncivil authorities, the officers of the army, the soldiers, the _ulema_,\r\nand _sheikhs_, the people great and small, of various creeds, within\r\nthe Vilayet of Monastir, all united to work for one cause by an oath\r\nmade upon the Unity of God, await your commands.” Another telegram was\r\ndespatched to inform the head-quarters of the Committee in Salonica\r\nthat the _coup_ had been made with success, and during that night young\r\nofficers posted manifestos on the walls in that city calling upon the\r\npeople to co-operate with the Committee and overthrow the Despotism.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of July 23 the citizens of Monastir woke up to find\r\nthat all signs of the Government’s authority had vanished, and that\r\nthe Committee had become the undisputed master of the Vilayet. It was\r\na day of frenzied rejoicings. The fifty thousand inhabitants of this\r\ncity and thousands of people from the surrounding country packed the\r\nstreets to cheer and sing the songs of liberty. Sometimes a narrow\r\nway would be opened through the dense crowd to allow the passing of\r\ncompanies of Anatolian troops joyfully marching to some appointed spot\r\nwhere they were to be sworn in on the Unity of God as adherents of the\r\nCommittee; or of a body of citizens carrying aloft on their shoulders\r\nthe _fedais_, the members of the Moslem bands that had saved Turkey,\r\nthe heroes of the hour.\r\n\r\nAnd ever and again there rose a roar of “Long live the Committee!”\r\nand the people went about seeking the members of the Committee, eager\r\nto do them honour and give them an ovation as they had done with the\r\n_fedais_. But the mysterious and invisible Committee was nowhere to\r\nbe found. An absorbing curiosity got hold of the people. Who were the\r\nmen, they asked themselves, who had acted on the executive of the\r\nCommittee, the secret leaders who had issued the manifestos and orders,\r\nwho had organised the movement with such skill and daring? But it was\r\nimpossible to obtain any answer to this question. It was not until some\r\ndays after the Sultan had granted the Constitution that Niazi himself\r\nwas given the names of those who composed the Monastir Executive, and\r\nthen he found that among them were some of his most intimate friends.\r\n\r\nBut on this wonderful day, July 23, the executive body of the Committee\r\nwas too busily engaged on most important work to come forward and\r\nreceive the congratulations that were its due; for much had yet to be\r\ndone. The Committee decided not to await the Sultan’s reply to its\r\ndemand, but to proclaim the Constitution that very day in Monastir, and\r\nit was held that the most fitting person to make this announcement to\r\nthe people would be the Governor of the Monastir Vilayet himself, the\r\nVali, Hifzi Pasha. The Vali, as we have seen, had been bold enough, a\r\nfew days earlier, to tell the Palace the exact truth concerning the\r\nstate of affairs in Macedonia. In reply to this the Grand Vizier had\r\ntelegraphed to rebuke him for lack of zeal and to give him certain\r\ninstructions. On this the Vali had sent in his resignation to the Grand\r\nVizier on the ground that he would not be responsible for the bloodshed\r\nand outrages which must follow the execution of such orders. It was\r\nwell known to the Committee that the Vali was a just and upright man\r\nwhose sympathies were rather with the friends of liberty than with the\r\nDespotism which he served.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the twenty-third the Vali openly joined the\r\nrevolutionary party. He sent telegrams to the Sultan and the Grand\r\nVizier informing them of the capture of Osman Pasha, and stating that\r\nthe entire military force in Monastir and 3500 armed men from among\r\nthe inhabitants were now the sworn adherents of the Committee. In\r\nthe afternoon the Vali read out the Committee’s proclamation of the\r\nConstitution in the presence of tens of thousands of enthusiastic\r\nMoslems and Christians, and the garrison of Monastir; and then the\r\ncannon thundered out a salute that told the surrounding country that\r\nTurkey was to be made free at last.\r\n\r\nOn this same day the Central Committee in Salonica and the branch\r\nCommittees in other towns came forward to give clear proof to the\r\npeople that the domination of the Palace was over. The Constitution was\r\nproclaimed in Resna, Dibra, and other towns in Macedonia and Albania\r\nat the same hour that it was proclaimed in Monastir. In Salonica the\r\nCentral Committee, which here, too, had the garrison on its side and\r\nthe Government at its mercy, decided that it would be to the interest\r\nof the revolutionary cause to make as short as possible the period\r\nof uncertainty as to whether it was to be civil war or peace; the\r\nenemies of liberty must be allowed no time for preparation or intrigue.\r\nAccordingly, at an early hour on June 23, the Committee telegraphed its\r\nultimatum to the Sultan, informing His Majesty that unless he granted\r\nthe Constitution within twenty-four hours the Second and Third Army\r\nCorps would march upon Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe Committee’s next step was to approach the Inspector-General, Hilmi\r\nPasha (who was made Grand Vizier in February last), and to call upon\r\nhim, as the highest Government official in Macedonia, to proclaim\r\nthe Constitution to the people. Hilmi had been a good servant of the\r\nSultan, but at heart he hated the corrupt Palace and its ways, and\r\nrecognised the justice of the Young Turkey cause which he had been\r\ninstructed to persecute, but had persecuted so half-heartedly that he\r\nhad drawn upon himself the rebukes of the Grand Vizier, Ferid Pasha.\r\nHilmi’s attitude was now correct and courageous. He told the Committee\r\nthat though his sympathies were with the Young Turkey party, he was\r\nstill the servant of the Sultan, and consequently could not proclaim\r\nthe Constitution unless ordered to do so by his sovereign. Upon this\r\nthe Committee informed him that unless he proclaimed the Constitution\r\nwithin twenty-four hours he would have to suffer the penalty—that is,\r\nto be put to death—that the telegraph lines were at his disposal and\r\nit behooved him, within the given time, to persuade the Sultan that\r\nresistance to the will of the people would be of no avail, and that His\r\nMajesty could only retain his position on the throne by the immediate\r\nrestoration of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nSo Hilmi Pasha now sent telegram after telegram to the Palace\r\nto explain the exact state of affairs. He exposed the absolute\r\nhopelessness of the cause of the old _régime_—the two Pashas on whom\r\nthe Sultan had relied to destroy the Committee of Union and Progress,\r\nHilmi and Osman, were the prisoners of the Committee; the Anatolian\r\ntroops that were to have stamped out the rebellion had become the sworn\r\nadherents of the Committee; the Second and Third Army Corps now formed\r\nthe army of the Committee; of the First Army Corps in Constantinople\r\nitself the Palace Guards alone were above suspicion; there was no\r\ntime to arouse the fanaticism of the Arabs and other Asiatics against\r\nthe Young Turks; the action of the Anatolian regiments that had been\r\nbrought to Salonica had proved that the Army Corps in Asia Minor had\r\nalso been brought round to the side of the reformers; and lastly, from\r\nall over the Empire the news was coming in that Valis of provinces\r\nand other high officials had deserted the Palace Camarilla for the\r\nconstitutional party.\r\n\r\nThat day the people of Turkey were rejoicing in their newly found\r\nliberty; but it was a twenty-four hours of suspense and anxiety for\r\nthe men who knew that it rested on the decision of one old man as to\r\nwhether it was to be peace or civil war. The ultimatum of the Committee\r\nand the telegrams of Hilmi Pasha were submitted to the Sultan by his\r\nterrified courtiers; but in the council chambers of the Yildiz, almost\r\nup to the last moment, there was hesitation and a conflict of opinions\r\nas to the course that should be adopted by the Government. There\r\nwere, of course, members of the Camarilla, Izzet Pasha among them,\r\nwho advocated resistance at any cost to the demands of the Committee,\r\nfor these men, conscious of the evil they had wrought, knew that the\r\nConstitution would mean for them ruin and exile, and perhaps death.\r\n\r\nBut, in the meanwhile, the Sultan had dismissed his Grand Vizier, Ferid\r\nPasha, and had summoned to his Palace Said Pasha and Kiamil Pasha, the\r\ntwo oldest, most experienced, and upright statesmen of his reign, both\r\nof whom, though no admirers of Palace methods, had been Grand Viziers,\r\nand both of whom had been in disgrace and danger of their lives through\r\nthe monarch’s caprice and the jealousy of corrupt courtiers. The Sultan\r\nnow appointed Said Pasha Grand Vizier in the place of Ferid Pasha.\r\nThroughout the day there had been fear and wrath and hesitation in\r\nthe Yildiz, but on the evening of the twenty-third all the ministers\r\nwere summoned to the Palace, and there was held the famous last\r\nState Council under the old _régime_. There was a long and anxious\r\ndiscussion, and to and fro between the Council and the Sultan went the\r\nChief Chamberlain and other messengers, keeping His Majesty informed of\r\nthe progress of the debate—a mere matter of form as laid down by the\r\netiquette of the Palace, for, as every one there knew, the Sultan was\r\nin the adjoining chamber sitting on the other side of the curtain which\r\nalone divided him from his consulting ministers, and could hear every\r\nword that was spoken.\r\n\r\nThe night passed by, the morning was near, and the ministers were\r\nstill debating. Said and Kiamil urged the necessity of yielding, and\r\nthere were others who agreed with them; but Abdul Hamid inspired as\r\nmuch fear as ever in his advisers, and each of these, knowing of what\r\nthings that listening man was capable when in a fit of anger, was\r\nafraid to be the first to utter the long-forbidden name “Constitution”;\r\nand the question was discussed in that ambiguous and circuitous fashion\r\nthat Orientals understand so well how to employ. At last there was\r\nbrought in to the Council Chamber on a litter the bedridden old Arab\r\nCourt Astrologer, Abdul Houda, a favourite of the Sultan, who has\r\nrecently died. He boldly put into plain words what was in the minds of\r\nall. Then Said Pasha asked the ministers whether it was their decision\r\nthat the Sultan should be advised to grant the Constitution. To this\r\nthey made no reply, and averted their eyes when he looked from one\r\nto another. Then, after a pause, Said quoted a Turkish proverb which\r\nis the equivalent of our own “Silence gives consent.” The Sultan was\r\nforthwith informed of the decision of his ministers, and to the relief\r\nof all he agreed without any demur to restore the Constitution; for the\r\nshrewd monarch had by now fully realised the position and had made up\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nSo on the morning of July 24 the great news was telegraphed to every\r\ncorner of the Ottoman Empire, and everywhere there were the same\r\nextraordinary demonstrations of popular joy. In Constantinople huge\r\ncrowds, composed of Moslems, Christians, and Jews, flocked to the\r\nYildiz to cheer the Sultan. On the broad quay of Salonica, Hilmi Pasha,\r\nto whom the Sultan’s decision had meant the withdrawal of his death\r\nwarrant, read out the proclamation of the Constitution to tens of\r\nthousands of exulting citizens.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan had promised the Constitution, and all that remained to be\r\ndone now was for him to issue the _Iradé_ that should confirm that\r\npromise and to take the oath of allegiance to the Constitution. Some\r\ndays passed, and his Majesty had taken no steps to perform these\r\nnecessary formalities. The ever-vigilant Committee of Union and\r\nProgress therefore saw to it that there should be no further delay, and\r\nissued its orders. Some Macedonian troops were hurriedly brought up\r\nto the capital and were placed outside the Yildiz, while a man-of-war\r\nwas stationed in the Bosphorus immediately below the Palace, with\r\nits guns directed on it. Then some young officers belonging to the\r\nCommittee demanded an audience of the Sultan and explained to him that\r\nhe must sign the _Iradé_ there and then, else the Macedonian troops\r\nwould overpower the Palace Guard and seize his Majesty’s person. The\r\nSultan yielded, the _Iradé_ was signed, and shortly afterwards the\r\nSheikh-ul-Islam administered to Abdul Hamid the oath by which he bound\r\nhimself to restore, and to observe faithfully, the Constitution which\r\nhe had violated thirty years before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n_AFTER THE REVOLUTION_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe victory had been won; the Young Turkey party was triumphant; the\r\nOttoman people had gained their liberty. There was complete individual\r\nliberty and liberty of the press; there were no more spies, no more\r\ndomiciliary visits, no more oppression. In short, the Turks, who for a\r\ngeneration had been groaning under the crudest of Oriental despotisms,\r\nin one day became as free as the people of England, indeed in some\r\nrespects considerably freer than them. Peace came of a sudden to this\r\ntroubled land which had for so long been an inferno of implacable\r\nracial hatreds, all men went about in security, and the peasants were\r\nable to sow their fields knowing that they themselves would be the\r\nreapers. This was not as other revolutions; for though for a time there\r\nwas no law in the land and no administration, there was no anarchy,\r\nthere were no cruel reprisals, there were no excesses; the conduct of\r\nthe entire population was admirable.\r\n\r\nThese revolutionaries, unlike those in some other lands, did not\r\nhasten, so soon as they had freed themselves of one despotism, to\r\ncast upon the country the still more galling chains of democratic\r\ntyranny. The people who made this revolution were the educated\r\nmen in Turkey, all that was best in the country; and thus from the\r\nbeginning this had been the most conservative of revolutions. There\r\nwas nothing approaching to socialism or anarchism in this movement.\r\nThe Young Turks, as I have already explained, have no theories about\r\nthe reconstruction of society; they have no schemes for the benefiting\r\nof one class by the spoliation of another; they do not believe that\r\none man is as good as another, or that manhood suffrage will bring the\r\nmillennium. Like the English revolution of 1688, this one came from\r\nabove and not from below. That the ignorant masses did not usurp the\r\ndirection of the movement, and by discrediting it prepare the way for\r\nthe restoration of the despotic power, was largely due to the fact\r\nthat Turkey, fortunately for herself, has had her revolution before\r\nshe has arrived at that stage of economic and industrial development\r\nwhen what we term the working-classes think out political and social\r\ntheories or, rather, accept the views of the mischievous demagogues who\r\nmislead them. There is no class hatred in Turkey; there are no large\r\nmanufacturing industries to produce hordes of discontented people in\r\nthe big cities, and, so far, there are no agrarian questions to trouble\r\nthe minds of the simple and pious Turkish peasantry.\r\n\r\nOf the seventy thousand exiles who returned to Turkey from Europe\r\nand America after the proclamation of the Constitution there\r\nwere of course some who had mixed with Russian anarchists, with\r\ninternationalists and other political extremists, and had absorbed\r\ntheir theories; but these are in a small minority and exercise no\r\nappreciable influence. The same may be said of a certain set of\r\nwell-to-do exiles who for years were idle Paris _flaneurs_, lost some\r\nof their Ottoman virtues, became poor patriots, and have now returned\r\nas _dilettante_ politicians, some of them to join the party which\r\nadvocates a thorough-going home rule all round for the various races\r\nof Turkey—a programme detestable to the more earnest Young Turks, who\r\nrealise that such a policy would lead to the certain disintegration of\r\nthe Empire.\r\n\r\nBut it is of the attitude of the people themselves and not of the\r\npoliticians that I wish to speak in this chapter. When the Ottomans\r\nof all races and creeds suddenly found themselves free they became\r\nfilled with an exceeding joy, a new sentiment of brotherhood, and a\r\nprofound gratitude to the saviours of the country, the Committee of\r\nUnion and Progress, that took the practical form of implicit obedience\r\nto the Committee’s mandates, so that it had little difficulty in\r\npreserving order. All over the country there were great demonstrations\r\nand rejoicings of enthusiastic and good-natured crowds, that touched\r\nforeign spectators of these scenes and compelled the sympathy even of\r\nthe cynically inclined. In the streets and _cafés_ and tramcars of the\r\ncapital, wherein men had been wont to meet in silence, each suspecting\r\nthe other, strangers, united by a common joy, now spoke to each other\r\nfreely and in kindly fashion. It was a reign of universal amity, and\r\nit seemed as if all that is best in human nature had come to the top.\r\nEuropean witnesses have described the wonderful fraternisations of men\r\nof all races and creeds: how Turks, Armenians, Bulgarians, and Jews\r\nharangued sympathetic crowds in the streets of the capital, preaching\r\npeace and good will among men; how even in Beyrout, notorious for the\r\nmassacres of Christians under the late _régime_, Christian priests\r\nand turbanned _mollahs_ embraced publicly before fraternising mobs\r\nof Moslems and Armenians; how in the same city the Turkish commander\r\nwith his officers and troops attended a service in the Armenian church\r\nto lament over the massacres of their Christian fellow-countrymen;\r\nand how, with the same object, crowds of Moslems in Stamboul went to\r\nthe Armenian cemetery to pray and place flowers upon the graves of\r\nthose who had been slaughtered by the orders of the Palace. It was the\r\nsame in Jerusalem, where the various Christian sects—hitherto kept\r\nfrom flying at each other’s throats by the bayonets of the Moslem\r\nsoldiery—now made friends and joined in processions with Mussulmans and\r\nJews.\r\n\r\nIn Salonica, the head-quarters of the revolution, there were scenes\r\nof intense national rejoicing that astonished European observers. The\r\nBulgarian, Greek, and other leaders of bands, the Albanian brigand\r\nchiefs, and all their followings of ferocious outlaws of the hills,\r\non whose heads there had been a price for years, men of different\r\nraces who since boyhood had been burning each other’s villages and\r\nkilling each other’s women, flocked into the town to submit to the\r\nCommittee, to be reconciled to one another, and to become the friends\r\nof the Moslem Turks. Sandansky himself, the king of the mountains, the\r\nmost formidable of the Bulgarian leaders of bands, came in, harangued\r\nthe crowds on liberty, fraternity, and justice, and was received\r\nwith the greatest enthusiasm. All these fighting men, who had spread\r\nterror through Macedonia and Albania, clad in the picturesque dress of\r\nEurope’s wildest and least known regions, forgot civil war and blood\r\nfeuds, fraternised with each other and with the Turkish soldiery,\r\nmarched down the streets roaring the songs of liberty, hobnobbed\r\ntogether over cups of coffee, and sometimes _mastic_ and _raki_, in the\r\n_cafés_, embraced each other, and swore to be brothers.\r\n\r\nI was in Salonica four months after Turkey had won her freedom, and\r\nthe national jubilation had not yet subsided; it was everywhere\r\nexultation and good-fellowship. Here, in this city of many races, I\r\nfound myself surrounded by a refreshing atmosphere of joyous delight in\r\nthe new-found liberty. From the window of my hotel I looked out upon\r\nthe busy quay and the blue sea that stretched to the snows of Olympus.\r\nAlong this quay passes most of the life of the town, and at frequent\r\nintervals something happened in front of me to remind me of the\r\nrevolution and of the keenness of the people. Now it was a procession\r\nof Christians and Mussulmans fraternising and singing patriotic songs\r\non their way to the railway station to cheer a newly elected Deputy\r\nwho was starting for Constantinople; now it was a body of troops of\r\nthe Macedonian army marching through crowds which hailed them as their\r\nliberators; now a battalion paraded on the quay to be exhorted by some\r\ngeneral before embarking for Constantinople, for at that time the Young\r\nTurks were despatching more of their faithful troops to the capital,\r\ndetermined to be in readiness should the forces of reaction reassert\r\nthemselves; now it was the return from over the water of some exile\r\nof despotism to the friends and relatives who had not seen him for\r\nyears. Thus one morning I saw a flag-decorated tender come off from a\r\nnewly arrived steamer and land on the stage in front of me the Albanian\r\nGeneral, Mehmed Pasha, just freed from a long exile in Baghdad; he\r\nwas welcomed with shouts and clapping of hands by the large crowd of\r\nAlbanians and others who had come to escort him to his house.\r\n\r\nThere were most affecting sights, too, to be seen in those early days\r\nof liberty. When it was decreed that political prisoners should be\r\nliberated, the gates of the prisons were thrown open, and out poured,\r\nin their thousands, the captives of the Despotism, to be received by\r\ncrowds of deeply moved sympathisers. Many of these unfortunate men had\r\nbeen confined for years in cells but twelve feet square, and came out\r\ninto fresh air and sunshine dazed and weak in mind, like the prisoner\r\nof the Bastille in Dickens’ famous story, to be led home by relatives\r\nand friends. Here one would see outside the prison door a husband and\r\nwife greet each other with tears of joy after years of separation, and\r\nhere some poor wretch, with spirit long since tortured out of him,\r\nweeping miserably as he wandered to and fro because no dear ones had\r\ncome to meet him, and he realised that they had died while he was in\r\ncaptivity.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant to observe the confidence and pride of the population\r\nin the Young Turk leaders, who had sacrificed so much for liberty\r\nand justice. The patriotism of the people of Salonica was then being\r\ndisplayed in various ways. Large sums were being collected to supply\r\ncomforts to the troops who throughout the winter were to guard the\r\nnorthern frontier against any attack on the part of Turkey’s enemies,\r\nand a movement had also been started in the town, which, if it spreads\r\nfar enough, may relieve the Government of some of its embarrassments.\r\nOfficers of the garrison and civil servants of all grades, reading of\r\nthe depleted treasury and the heavy burden of the floating debt, were\r\nabandoning their claims to their arrears of pay, because, as they said,\r\ntheir country needed the money. Deputies, also, were refusing to accept\r\ntheir travelling allowances.\r\n\r\nFor one who knew Turkey under the old _régime_ it was very interesting,\r\nin Constantinople, to observe the outward signs of the great change\r\nwhich had come to the country, and to note the attitude of a population\r\nwhich found itself suddenly in the enjoyment of the widest liberty.\r\nIn most countries, after such a revolution, the people would have\r\nbeen intoxicated with their new freedom; the forces of disorder would\r\nhave been let loose; there would have been, for a while, a condition\r\napproaching anarchy. But Constantinople is not like other European\r\ncapitals, and it took its revolution in a sensible fashion. All the\r\nold restrictions had been swept away; but liberty had not broken into\r\nlicense. Though there was no longer a censorship of printed matter,\r\nthe Turkish press observed a dignified moderation in its tone. For the\r\nfirst time the comic papers were free to publish political caricatures\r\nin which the highest personages were represented; but if one might\r\njudge from such as were exhibited in the windows of the newspaper\r\nshops, there was nothing offensive in these somewhat crude pictures.\r\nLarge crowds attended political meetings in the capital; but there was\r\nno disturbance of the peace and there was no need for the presence of\r\nthe police or the troops, save when the Greeks, who are never happy\r\nunless they have some real or imaginary grievance to make a noise\r\nabout, made demonstrations during the elections. People now enjoyed\r\nthe right to form themselves into associations, but one heard of no\r\nanarchical societies; and apparently the first result of this new\r\nprivilege was that the Turkish temperance reformers availed themselves\r\nof it to establish a total abstinence league in Cæsarea.\r\n\r\nBut, as might be expected, the interregnum between the withdrawal of\r\nthe authority of the old _régime_ with its severe code and its armies\r\nof spies, and the reorganisation of the police and other departments\r\nby the Young Turks was taken advantage of to some extent by the\r\nignorant and lawless. At the beginning of the revolution all prisoners,\r\nincluding the criminals, were released from the gaols—probably because\r\nit was impossible in many cases to ascertain whether the offence for\r\nwhich a man had been confined was a political one or otherwise. The\r\nrestrictions on the sale and carrying of fire-arms were also removed,\r\nwith the result that revolvers in tens of thousands poured into the\r\ncity and were at once bought up. A large proportion of the population\r\ncarried revolvers and also let them off; men practised with them in the\r\nstreets; accidents were frequent; and in some quarters of the city,\r\nespecially in the poorer Greek quarters, it was not unusual to hear a\r\nregular fusillade going on at night, generally in honour of something\r\nor other, or to spread the news that a house was on fire. Robbery with\r\nviolence in the streets certainly increased after the revolution.\r\nBut, notwithstanding all this, it could not be fairly said that\r\nConstantinople was a dangerous place to walk about in at any hour; and\r\nindeed, when it is remembered what a lot of cosmopolitan blackguardism\r\nthere is in that city of over a million inhabitants, it is astonishing\r\nthat there was so large a measure of security for life and property.\r\n\r\nIt was natural, too, that Turks of the poorer and more ignorant class\r\nshould be under the impression that this new constitutional liberty\r\nmeant that each man was free to do what he liked—a common error\r\nwhich before long was eradicated from the minds of this naturally\r\nlaw-abiding people by the Young Turk administration. Thus many thought\r\nthat the Constitution wiped out the liability to pay any private debts\r\nincurred before the revolution. In the country, peasants came to the\r\nconclusion that they would no longer be called upon to pay taxes; in\r\nthe towns the contrabandists sold their smuggled tobacco openly; and\r\nin Constantinople itself the popular conception of liberty produced\r\nsome amusing results. The firewood sellers were to be seen calmly\r\nchopping up their logs in the middle of a busy thoroughfare; pavements\r\nwere often blocked with the wares of the hawkers; and others in like\r\nmanner carried on their avocations in public; so that the narrow,\r\ncrowded streets and the Galata Bridge, difficult enough to traverse\r\nin the days of the old régime, became almost impassable. This sums up\r\nthe inconveniences of the interregnum; they were wonderfully few and\r\ntrifling when one bears in mind what a revolution this had been.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, difficult for the Young Turks to reorganise the\r\npolice and carry out administrative reforms until Parliament met;\r\nfor the provisionary Ministry was naturally disinclined to accept\r\nmuch responsibility. But in the meanwhile, though there was a little\r\nlicense in small matters, the people were made to understand clearly\r\nthat the Committee would stand no nonsense. This was proved at the\r\ntime of the coaling strike in Galata not long after the proclamation\r\nof the Constitution. The men, having struck once and obtained the\r\nconcession of their demands, came to the conclusion that under the new\r\nConstitution they were free to extort what they pleased and terrorise\r\nthe population; so they struck again for a prohibitive rate of wage\r\nwhich would have closed the port to commerce. It was a critical\r\ntime: the Young Turks were on their trial; their movement had been\r\nrepresented by their enemies as anarchical; their cause would be lost\r\nwere they to fail to preserve order among the populace. It must be\r\nremembered that this was not only the question of a strike, but of\r\nprobable rioting of so serious a nature that it might have caused\r\nEuropean intervention; for these labourers who coal the ships at Galata\r\nbelong to that rabble of Kurds and other Mussulmans of the lowest\r\nclass which is only too ready, on a hint from the Palace, to set about\r\nmassacring Armenians and other Christians.\r\n\r\nIt therefore behooved the Young Turks to prove that they could rule\r\nmen, and they did so. Two young officers rode boldly, unescorted,\r\ninto the middle of a dangerous crowd of the strikers, and by their\r\nfirm attitude compelled the men to listen to them. First they tried\r\npersuasion, and pointed out to the strikers that by their action\r\nthey were prejudicing the cause of freedom which they had so loudly\r\nacclaimed but a few days before. But the men would not be persuaded and\r\nrefused to go back to their work. Then the two officers changed their\r\nattitude. One, drawing his revolver, reminded the men that under the\r\nold _régime_ the soldiers would have been sent to throw them into the\r\nwater or cast them into prison! “And as you are conducting yourselves\r\nas friends of the old _régime_, so shall you be treated,” he exclaimed.\r\n“I will come down here to-morrow and ask you to return at once to your\r\nwork. I will with my own hand shoot down the first man who refuses to\r\ndo so, and the rest of you will be swept into the sea or into prison.”\r\nThe next morning the two officers rode to the quay followed by a body\r\nof cavalry. The strikers knew that what had been said was meant, and\r\nquietly went off to work, and there has been no trouble since with this\r\ndangerous element of the population.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Committee, by its firmness and justice, made itself loved\r\nof the people, who at last came to obey its orders without question.\r\nThus, when the Committee enjoined the strict boycott of Austrian\r\ntrade, while at the same time forbidding the populace to molest or\r\ninsult Austrian subjects, a wonderful thing happened. The Austrians\r\nwere able to go about the streets in perfect safety; and the Austrian\r\nshops remained open, but no one would buy of them, however cheaply they\r\noffered their goods. The rough and ignorant Kurds who do the coaling\r\nand also earn their living as lightermen and as porters in Galata, and\r\nthe poor Jews who do the same work in Salonica, to a man enforced the\r\nboycott, though it meant for them a great falling off in their small\r\nwages, and short commons for their families. Thus no Constantinople\r\nboatman would take a passenger off to an Austrian steamer, or carry\r\nhim on shore from it when he reached his destination. These steamers\r\nhad to use their own launches for the embarkation and disembarkation\r\nof passengers; and the person who had sailed under this tabooed flag\r\nsometimes found himself in a sorry plight even after he had been landed\r\non a Turkish quay, no porter being willing to carry his baggage. But\r\nin February last, so soon as the Governments of Turkey and Austria had\r\narranged their differences, the Committee of Union and Progress gave\r\nthe word that the boycott should cease; and cease it did within an hour\r\nof this order: the boatmen, porters, lightermen, and dock labourers\r\nin every port in Turkey coming out as one man to work again for the\r\nAustrians.\r\n\r\nIn the cities and in the countryside all seemed to be going well\r\nwith the cause of the Young Turks; but foreigners who observed\r\nthis harmonious opening of the new _régime_ and this extraordinary\r\nfraternisation of men of different races and creeds hitherto\r\nirreconcilable asked themselves how long this reign of universal\r\nfriendship could last, and whether this falling into each other’s arms\r\nof Turks, Armenians, Bulgarians, and others was due to any sentiment\r\nmore deep and permanent than the joyous intoxication caused by this\r\nunaccustomed wine of liberty. Like other Englishmen in Turkey at that\r\ntime, I came to the conclusion that the Young Turks were quite sincere;\r\nthat they were honestly desirous to have done with internal strife,\r\nto give equality to all the elements of the population, and to live\r\nin peace and friendship with their non-Moslem fellow-countrymen. The\r\nArmenians and Jews have proved their sincerity by cooperating loyally\r\nwith the Young Turks throughout the parliamentary elections and since.\r\nOf the Macedonian Christians the bulk had become weary of bloodshed\r\nand the internecine conflict that had brought nothing but suffering\r\nand ruin to the population; and there was no insincerity about the\r\nfriendly relationship that sprang up between the sturdy Bulgarian\r\nleaders of fighting bands and their former foes, the Turkish officers,\r\nfor they respected each other. The civil warfare in Macedonia had been\r\ndeliberately fomented by the machinations of the Palace gang, to whom\r\nthe doctrine of _divide et impera_ was ideal statesmanship, and to the\r\nintrigues of Bulgaria, Servia, and Greece. There is no reason why, if\r\nleft alone, these peoples might not dwell together in peace. A short\r\ntime since a _mollah_, addressing the people, said, “Before the reign\r\nof Abdul Hamid the Moslem and Christian mothers used to nurse each\r\nother’s children.” But will these Macedonian peoples be left alone by\r\nPalace agents of reaction, by those Great Powers whose interests are\r\nopposed to the creation of a strong and independent Turkey, and by the\r\ngreedy little neighbouring states?\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, too much to hope that constitutional government has\r\nput a sudden end to the religious and racial strife in Macedonia.\r\nThe Greeks in the country have already demonstrated the illusiveness\r\nof such an expectation. The Greeks, like the others, welcomed the\r\nConstitution and fraternised with their Ottoman fellow-countrymen.\r\nCarried away by the enthusiasm of the moment they may have been\r\nsincere in their protestations of brotherhood, but one suspects that\r\nthe mental reservations were at the back of their brains all the\r\nwhile. If one misjudges them in this, then their own actions and\r\nthe utterances of their press belie them. In the hour of national\r\njubilation they supplied the one discordant note. One of the first uses\r\nthat they made of the freedom which the Young Turks had won for them\r\nwas to boycott and insult the Bulgarians in Salonica, and the news came\r\nthat the Greek clergymen in the interior were once more persecuting\r\nthe Bulgarian exarchists, and had drawn up prescription lists of the\r\nleading Bulgarians with a view to getting them assassinated. The Greek\r\nelement of the population, as might be expected, was the first to\r\nexpress dissatisfaction with the policy and administration of the Young\r\nTurks. The intolerant and often mischievously active Greek Patriarchate\r\nin Constantinople, which denied the Bulgarians the use of their own\r\nlanguage, supported the Greeks in clamouring for much more than was\r\ntheir due. Their idea of Ottoman citizenship, so far as themselves were\r\nconcerned, was to avoid all the obligations of that citizenship, while\r\nenjoying all the rights conferred by it and retaining all their special\r\nprivileges intact. They seemed to think that the government of Turkey\r\nshould be in their hands. During the elections it was they alone who\r\nprovoked rioting and at Smyrna they created a dangerous disturbance\r\nwith their armed mobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n_EUROPEAN ASSISTANCE_\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the four months’ interregnum between the granting of the\r\nConstitution and the opening of Parliament, the Committee of Union\r\nand Progress was the undisputed ruler of Turkey. It dictated to the\r\nmonarch what his decrees should be, it moved armies, it removed and\r\nappointed ministers, governors of provinces, and other high officials.\r\nThese untried young men who formed the Committee, while introducing a\r\nnew order of things and protecting their country against the numerous\r\ndangers that threatened to destroy the newly gained liberty, displayed\r\na wisdom, tact, moderation, shrewdness, and foresight that were\r\nastonishing to foreign observers. They maintained order with firmness,\r\ngreatly assisted in this by the dignified self-control and patriotism\r\nof the people themselves. Though they and thousands of others had\r\nsuffered much from the cruelty and rapacity of the Despotism and its\r\nparasites, they displayed no vindictiveness; they punished only the\r\nmost guilty of these; removed only those who showed by their actions\r\nthat they were a source of danger to the Constitution; and they frankly\r\nforgave the others. The relations of Turkey with foreign Powers were\r\ndirected by them with a tactful and resourceful statesmanship. Their\r\nmistakes were remarkably few.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning they showed their fitness to rule. The avowed\r\nobject of the Young Turks had been to depose the Sultan, and when\r\nthey offered him the alternative of acceptance of the Constitution or\r\nabdication, they had little expectation that he would submit to their\r\nconditions. But when the astute Sultan did submit in a very graceful\r\nmanner, protesting that he was a believer in a constitutional form of\r\ngovernment, and posing as if he and not the revolutionary party had\r\nbrought the boon of liberty to his subjects, the Young Turks showed\r\ntheir statesmanship by as graciously accepting the situation, and\r\nbecame once more the loyal subjects of a constitutional monarch, whose\r\ncleverness and diplomatic experience, if he would now use them rightly,\r\nmight be of great service to his country and his people. The Sultan is\r\nthe Commander of the Faithful to millions of Mussulmans, and had the\r\nCommittee attempted to depose him at that critical time a long civil\r\nwar might have resulted. So Abdul Hamid was left on the throne of\r\nOthman, nominally ruling, to outward seeming popular with the people,\r\nwho cheered him enthusiastically whenever he appeared in public. But\r\nthe Young Turks had not forgotten how Abdul Hamid, in 1878, destroyed\r\nthe Constitution which he had sworn to uphold, so that power behind the\r\nthrone, the Committee of Union and Progress, remained ever watchful,\r\nas the strong guardian of the people’s liberties.\r\n\r\nI will now briefly sum up the results of the Committee’s energetic\r\naction during the few weeks immediately following the proclamation\r\nof the Constitution. In the first place it had to make itself as\r\nstrong as possible so as to combat the reactionary intrigues that\r\nwere working for the restoration of the Despotism. It therefore set\r\nitself to establish its hold on the army, to obtain the sanction of\r\nthe Moslem religion, and to complete the pacification of Macedonia.\r\nIt took the precaution of removing from the Second and Third Army\r\nCorps all officers suspected of reactionary views, and concentrated\r\nthe bulk of the troops loyal to the Constitution at Adrianople, within\r\nstriking distance of the capital, where, at any rate, a considerable\r\nportion of the First Army Corps and the Sultan’s Prætorian Guard\r\nonly needed the word from the Palace to become the instrument of the\r\nreactionaries. Later on the Committee was able to obtain the removal of\r\nmost of the battalions of the Imperial Guard from Constantinople and to\r\nreplace them with troops from Salonica, thus securing the Committee’s\r\ndomination in the capital.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHATEAU OF ASIA]\r\n\r\nAs regards the religious question, the work of the Young Turks was\r\nmade easy by the Sheikh-ul-Islam, who—so soon as he had administered\r\nto the Sultan the oath by which the latter swore to respect the\r\nConstitution—proclaimed to the faithful that constitutional government\r\nwas not contrary to, but was in accordance with, the teaching of the\r\nKoran; he rebuked the fanatics who were preaching against the\r\nreforms as being anti-religious, and saw to it that the mosques were\r\nnot used as centres of reactionary agitation and intrigue. For the\r\nreactionaries were not idle, and, in European as well as in Asiatic\r\nTurkey, their agents—often ex-Palace spies disguised as doctors of the\r\nsacred law and _hodjas_—were appealing to Moslem bigotry and denouncing\r\nthe Constitution as the invention of the Evil One himself. To\r\ncounteract this mischievous propaganda the Committee sent out its own\r\nmissionaries all over the country, and doctors learned in the sacred\r\nlaw and others enlightened the people, supporting their arguments with\r\nquotations from the Koran, and in many cases preaching sermons that\r\nhad been written for this purpose by the Sheikh-ul-Islam himself. It\r\nwas also a great help to the cause that nearly all the Turkish press\r\nsupported the Committee. Indeed, during the first few months of the new\r\n_régime_, a paper holding the unpopular opposite opinions would have\r\nhad but few readers.\r\n\r\nThe Committee, having army, religion, and press on its side, was strong\r\nenough to dominate the Palace. It demanded of the Sultan the signing\r\nof _Iradé_ after _Iradé_, and if the required Imperial decree was\r\nnot immediately forthcoming, a threat that the Adrianople army would\r\nmarch upon Constantinople within twenty-four hours always produced the\r\ndesired effect. Thus, within a few days after the proclamation of the\r\nConstitution, Abdul Hamid had to sign _Iradés_ by virtue of which he\r\ngranted a general amnesty, the release of all political prisoners,\r\nthe abolition of the spy system, the inviolability of domicile, a free\r\npress, the abolition of the censorship, the liberty of the individual\r\nto travel in foreign countries, in short, all the privileges enjoyed by\r\nthe citizens of free countries.\r\n\r\nThen the Sultan was compelled to dismiss his favourites and principal\r\nadvisers, including his hated secretary, Izzet Pasha, his old Arab\r\nastrologer, Abdul Houda, Tashin Pasha, and Ismail Pasha, the founder\r\nof the detestable military spy system. The Camarilla, that had\r\nall but destroyed Turkey, was broken up and scattered. Izzet and\r\nseveral other notorious people effected their escape to England and\r\nelsewhere—fortunately for some of them, who, had they remained, would\r\nprobably have been torn to pieces by infuriated mobs, like the infamous\r\nFehmi Pasha. But the Young Turks, as I have explained, despite the\r\nintense hatred which some of them must have nourished against the\r\ncruel oppressors and traitors to their country who had acted as the\r\ninstruments of the Despotism, refrained from vengeance, and there\r\nwere no reprisals. Penalties were only inflicted where the country’s\r\ngood demanded these. Some of the worst ministers of the tyranny were\r\nimprisoned in the War Office, or confined in their own houses on\r\nPrinkipo Island in the Sea of Marmora, where many rich Turks have their\r\nsummer residences. Some have undergone their trial, and have been\r\ncompelled to disgorge the public moneys which they had embezzled. For\r\nthe rest it was complete amnesty, and when the Constantinople mobs\r\nbegan to occupy themselves in hunting down men recognised to have been\r\nspies of the Palace, in order to carry them off to the prison of the\r\nWar Office, the Committee, whose word had to be obeyed, peremptorily\r\nforbade this practice. On the other hand, if any man took advantage of\r\nthis leniency to indulge in reactionary intrigue, sterner justice was\r\nadministered. Ismail Pasha, for example, the inventor of the military\r\nspy system, for very good reasons was shot in Constantinople in\r\nDecember last by a young officer.\r\n\r\nThe Committee recognised that one of their first duties was to complete\r\nthe pacification of Macedonia. They successfully accomplished this\r\nwithin a very short time, and without bloodshed. The Greeks alone were\r\ncausing any difficulty; but the Greek bishops, clergy, and leaders of\r\nbands came to understand that the Young Turks would put up with no\r\nnonsense from them, and that the sympathy of Europe would not be with\r\nthem if they resisted the new _régime_. So it was not long after the\r\ngranting of the Constitution that the last Greek band came in, and for\r\nthe first time for many years there was peace in Macedonia. The British\r\nGovernment, recognising that there was no longer any need for European\r\nintervention in that region, withdrew from the arrangement with Russia\r\nthat had resulted from the Reval meeting, displaying a confidence in\r\nthe Young Turks that won their deep gratitude. The Young Turks had a\r\nvery keen appreciation of the sympathy that was displayed for them by\r\nthe English. To Englishmen travelling in the country, at that time, the\r\nsincere and hearty friendship extended to them by the Turkish people\r\nwas most gratifying and affecting.\r\n\r\nIt is one thing to make a revolution, but it is quite another thing\r\nto undertake to govern and administer a country after the successful\r\nrevolution has swept away the old order. The Young Turks showed that\r\nthey were wise enough to know their own limitations. There were few\r\namong them who had any knowledge of administration, public finance,\r\nand diplomacy; so they decided to make use of the existing machinery\r\nof government. They got rid of the notoriously corrupt among the high\r\nofficials, but retained the services of the more capable and upright\r\nof the ministers, provincial governors, and others, even if they\r\nhappened to be Pashas of the old-school, fanatical Mussulmans who hated\r\nEuropean ways, looked askance at liberty, and regarded with horror the\r\nscheme for giving equal rights to Christians and Moslems. But these\r\nold servants of the State were kept under observation, and they were\r\npromptly ousted if they failed to exercise their authority on the\r\nlines laid down by the Constitution, and faithfully to hold aloof from\r\nreactionary intrigue. As many of these officials were honest patriots\r\nat heart, though narrow-minded in their views, the compromise worked\r\nwell pending the training of a new school of administrators belonging\r\nto the Young Turk party.\r\n\r\nThus to the highest office of all, the Grand Vizierate, men of long\r\nadministrative experience have been appointed. So soon as the Sultan\r\nhad submitted to the will of the people, the then Grand Vizier, Ferid\r\nPasha, and his ministers had to go, for they were too closely connected\r\nwith the Hamidian system to be trusted; but the three Grand Viziers\r\nwho have so far succeeded Ferid—Said Pasha, Kiamil Pasha, and Hilmi\r\nPasha—have all taken a prominent part as servants of the State under\r\nthe old _régime_, Said and Hilmi having already been Grand Viziers\r\non several occasions. Said Pasha, the first Grand Vizier under the\r\nnew _régime_, has been the Sultan’s friend and adviser—disgraced at\r\nintervals like the rest—from the commencement of the reign. First,\r\nas the Sultan’s secretary, he helped his master to overthrow Midhat\r\nPasha’s Constitution and to destroy the power of the Sublime Porte.\r\nA few years later, as Grand Vizier, he encouraged the Sultan in his\r\nPan-Islamic dreams, and in his effort to deprive the Christians in\r\nTurkey of their ancient privileges. He had proved himself an upright\r\nand strong man, and in his old age he had modified his views and\r\nrecognised the evils of the despotic system which he had helped to\r\nbuild up, but he was scarcely the right sort of man to be Prime\r\nMinister under a constitutional government, and it is not astonishing\r\nthat his term of office lasted for but a few days. His first mistake\r\nwas in the execution of the Imperial _Iradé_ that liberated all\r\npolitical prisoners. He took it upon himself to free all the criminals\r\nas well, letting loose upon the capital, at that critical time, a\r\ncrowd of murderers and robbers. The ever-watchful Committee, mindful\r\nof Said’s career, suspected that he had acted thus in order to cause\r\ndisorder in the city, and so injure the cause of the Young Turkey party\r\nin the interest of the reactionaries. A week later a discovery was made\r\nthat precipitated the crisis. Said, while drawing up a statement of the\r\nprincipal points of the Constitution, to which the Sultan’s signature\r\nwas to be appended in token of adhesion, had altered a clause so as to\r\nleave the appointment of the Ministers of War and Marine to the Sultan,\r\ninstead of to the Grand Vizier, as had been laid down by Midhat’s\r\nConstitution. To leave the control of the army in the hands of the\r\nSultan was to place more trust in his word than the Young Turks were\r\nwilling to do. So the Committee, as guardian of the nation’s hard-won\r\nliberty, gave the word that has to be obeyed. Said had to resign, and\r\nhis Ministers of War and Marine were at once placed under arrest, as a\r\nprecautionary measure.\r\n\r\nOn August 6, 1908, Kiamil Pasha was appointed Grand Vizier, and was\r\nallowed to choose his own ministers; of the members of Said’s Ministry\r\nhe retained but two, the Sheikh-ul-Islam and the Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs. The appointment of Kiamil was universally acclaimed. Able,\r\nfirm, and patriotic, with an honourable career behind him, he was a\r\n_persona grata_ with men of all races and creeds, and was the most\r\npopular statesman in Turkey. He had always been the steadfast friend\r\nof the English, and has many friends in England. The gracious telegram\r\nof congratulation which King Edward VII sent on Kiamil’s appointment\r\nproduced a wonderful effect and did much to tighten the cordial\r\nrelations between the two countries.\r\n\r\nKiamil is now about eighty-seven years of age. Throughout his long\r\ncareer this wise old man has shown himself incorrupt and a hater of\r\ncorruption, a lover of justice, an advocate of reform, but moderate,\r\nunwilling to force radical changes on a people yet unripe, a man\r\nof wide knowledge, free from fanaticism and friendly to Europeans,\r\nwhile ready to protect his country against the undue influence in\r\nher internal affairs which has been exercised with such callous\r\nselfishness, to their own advantage and to Turkey’s partial ruin, by\r\ncertain Powers.\r\n\r\nSix months before the outbreak of the revolution, Kiamil was holding\r\nthe important office of Vali of the province of Aidin, of which Smyrna,\r\nthe commercial centre of the Levant, is the capital. Here for thirteen\r\nyears he had won the confidence and affection of people of every class\r\nby the justice and usefulness of his administration. But the Camarilla\r\never hated a just and honest man, and Palace intrigue arranged for\r\nhis destruction. He was falsely accused of being in league with the\r\nbrigands of Asia Minor; secret instructions were given for his arrest,\r\nand a steamer was sent to Smyrna to convey him as an exile to the\r\nisland of Rhodes. Under the Despotism exiles died quickly, and Captain\r\nvon Herbert, from whose description of the incident in the _Fortnightly\r\nReview_ I have taken some of my facts, himself saw the canvas sack in\r\nwhich it was intended to drop Kiamil overboard during the voyage—the\r\nofficial account would doubtless have informed the world that the Pasha\r\nhad died of sea-sickness. But fortunately Kiamil obtained knowledge of\r\nthe order for his arrest, and on January 12 he hurried to the British\r\nConsulate at Smyrna, and there took refuge under the British flag. The\r\nConsul gladly received him, and got into telegraphic communication\r\nwith London. Sir Edward Grey commanded that British protection should\r\nbe extended to the Pasha, who as a native of Cyprus was technically\r\nentitled to claim it. The Consulate was surrounded by police and spies,\r\nthe steamers in the port were closely watched; but, despite all the\r\nprecautions that were taken, Kiamil was able to escape in the steam\r\nlaunch belonging to the well-known banking firm of the Whittals, and\r\ngot safely on board a German liner bound for Stamboul. The steamer duly\r\narrived at her destination; the British Ambassador guaranteed that\r\nKiamil should have interviews with the Sultan at which none of the\r\nCamarilla would be present; and the Pasha landed in the capital, thus\r\nplacing himself in the power of the Despot; which was a brave thing to\r\ndo when one bears in mind the fate of Midhat and others. Kiamil had his\r\nprivate interviews with Abdul Hamid, and spoke to him boldly concerning\r\nthe evils of his rule, the ruin that was threatening the Ottoman\r\nEmpire, and the corruption and villainy of the Sovereign’s _entourage_.\r\nBut the Camarilla still remained to exercise its mischievous power\r\nuntil the very end, though apparently it dared not interfere with\r\none still nominally under the protection of England; for Kiamil did\r\nnot disappear mysteriously. He kept outside public affairs and dwelt\r\nquietly in his house in Constantinople—no doubt under the close\r\nsurveillance of spies—until the successful revolution brought him once\r\nagain to the head of affairs.\r\n\r\nDuring the first six months of the new _régime_, that very critical\r\nperiod when the Constitution was menaced by foes within and without,\r\nand even the integrity of the Empire was at stake—Kiamil, as Grand\r\nVizier, steered the ship of State safely through many dangers, and his\r\nshrewd and cautious diplomacy greatly strengthened the position of\r\nTurkey. His ministers, among whom were one Armenian and one Greek, were\r\nmen whose characters were above reproach, and they did much to reform\r\nthe machinery of their respective departments. Kiamil stood his country\r\nin good stead, and Turkey has good reason to be grateful to him; but\r\nhe, too, after six months of office, had to resign, though with no loss\r\nof honour to himself, at the bidding of the Committee; and, as in the\r\ncase of his predecessor, Said Pasha, the question of the appointment of\r\nthe Ministers of War and Marine was the immediate cause of the Cabinet\r\ncrisis—a matter concerning which I shall say more in another chapter.\r\n\r\nKiamil’s successor to the Grand Vizierate, Hilmi Pasha, is another man\r\nof the old _régime_. I have already spoken of the part which he took\r\nin Salonica during the last days of the Despotism, when the Committee\r\nthreatened him with death. Long before any one thought that there\r\nwas a chance of Hilmi’s becoming Grand Vizier, he was described to\r\nme as being an honest and able man of strong character, with a good\r\nrecord behind him, somewhat fanatical, and with little sympathy with\r\nthe Christian elements of the population. As Inspector-General in\r\nSalonica before the revolution, he obeyed the instructions given to\r\nhim by the Palace, and obstructed as much as possible the reforms in\r\nMacedonia—dictated by the Great Powers—which it was his ostensible duty\r\nto superintend. But to stand in the way of European intervention was no\r\ngrave fault in the eyes of the Young Turks. Though the officer of the\r\nDespotism, Hilmi’s sympathies were with the cause of the reformers, and\r\nhe is now trusted by them.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, therefore, the Young Turks have placed at the\r\nhead of the Government, not advanced reformers, not ambitious men out\r\nof their own ranks, but experienced men of the old _régime_, who,\r\nso far, have done well, and have been able on occasions to check\r\nhasty and ill-considered changes. In other respects, too, the Young\r\nTurks have manifested their moderation and wise opportunism. Foreign\r\nintervention is the thing that they detest and fear most, for it has\r\nworked nothing but ill for the Empire; but these men are free from\r\nany anti-European feeling, and while anxious, as soon as possible, to\r\nget rid of the Capitulations and other fetters which the Powers have\r\nplaced upon Ottoman independence, they welcome European assistance to\r\nplace their house in order. Thus it was at the request of the Turkish\r\nGovernment that France lent Turkey the aid of the great financial\r\nauthority, M. Laurent, to assist in the reorganisation of the finances\r\nof the country and the establishment of less wasteful methods of tax\r\ncollection, and that England lent the services of Mr. Crawford to\r\nconduct the reorganisation of the Customs. Turkey has also asked for,\r\nand has obtained, the services of an English admiral and several naval\r\nofficers to help her recreate the navy which was destroyed during the\r\nHamidian _régime_, and Baron von der Goltz, who has already done so\r\nmuch good for the Turkish army, is to be entrusted with powers that\r\nwill enable him to bring it up to a high state of efficiency. The Young\r\nTurks, anxious to develop the great natural resources of their country,\r\nhave also borrowed from France excellent engineers to superintend the\r\nconstruction of irrigation works and the execution of other useful\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\nWhile what is best of the old _régime_ still supplies the higher\r\nofficialdom, nearly all the men belonging to the lower grades of the\r\nCivil Service, as I have already pointed out, had become adherents\r\nof the Committee of Union and Progress some time before the outbreak\r\nof the revolution. Most of these men, under the corrupt system that\r\nthen prevailed, had to supplement their miserable pay, generally in\r\narrears, by taking _bakshish_ and by robbing the State in other ways.\r\nThis general impurity of the officialdom was loathsome to many of those\r\nwho were compelled to follow the almost universal practice in order to\r\nkeep themselves and their families alive. Minor officials knew that\r\nwhat was wrung from the people in the form of taxation was not spent\r\nfor the country’s good, but was for the most part appropriated by\r\nthe Palace gang, and it was but natural that they helped themselves\r\nto a share. But the Turks, in their dealings between man and man,\r\nare among the most honest of people, and public sentiment regarding\r\nofficial corruption has been undergoing a remarkable change since the\r\nrevolution. The newspapers preached public purity, and the servants of\r\nthe State began to realise that for the future the misappropriation\r\nof public moneys would not be at the cost of the Palace gang as\r\nheretofore, but at the cost of their beloved country itself, which was\r\nin sore need of money to further its regeneration and to strengthen its\r\ndefences against the formidable enemies that threatened its integrity.\r\nI have told the story of the patriotic civil servants in Salonica, who\r\nabandoned their claims to arrears of pay in view of their country’s\r\nnecessities; I am assured that the same sense of civic virtue has led\r\nto a remarkable diminution of the corrupt practices in the various\r\npublic departments. I have heard it maintained that the Turks cannot\r\nchange their nature, and that Turkish administration always has\r\nbeen, and always will be, corrupt, whether the form of government be\r\ndespotic or constitutional. One might as fairly have argued thus about\r\nEngland’s administration in India, or in the British Isles themselves,\r\nbut a few generations ago. A people who, like the Turks, are honest\r\nas individuals, and intensely patriotic, are likely to arrive at the\r\nright moral sense in a matter like this. The Japanese, who, while being\r\nas patriotic as the Turks, are not remarkable for commercial probity,\r\nregard it as far more criminal to embezzle the country’s funds than to\r\ncheat the individual; but Japan is the only country which has attained\r\nthis high ethical standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n_MUTINOUS PALACE GUARDS_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not within the scope of this work to deal with the foreign\r\ncomplications which followed the Turkish revolution. Suffice it to\r\nsay that the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the beginning of\r\nOctober had the effect of striking what might well have proved to be\r\na deadly blow at the party of reform in Turkey. It was the old story\r\nof an ambitious Christian Power, fearing lest a reformed Turkey might\r\nbecome a strong Turkey, treacherously obstructing her path of progress.\r\nAustria’s action gave the reactionaries their last chance of bringing\r\nback the old order of things, and they fully availed themselves of it.\r\n“These Young Turks,” they were able to say to the people, “used the\r\npreservation of the integrity of the Empire as their watchword when\r\nthey rebelled against the Padisha; and lo! the first thing that happens\r\nafter they get the power is the complete separation from Turkey of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, a declaration of independence on the part of\r\nthe Bulgarians and a separatist movement in Crete!” These arguments\r\nproduced a considerable effect upon the ignorant, who blamed the\r\nreformers for what had happened and clamoured for rulers strong enough\r\nto protect Turkey against her foreign foes.\r\n\r\nThe reactionaries were wholly unscrupulous in their methods and were\r\nprepared to plunge their country into a disastrous war if by so doing\r\nthey could restore the Despotism. Ex-spies and other reactionaries made\r\ndemonstrations in favour of war with Austria in some of the mosques of\r\nthe capital; they posted placards on the walls of the city by night,\r\ncalling upon Mussulmans to massacre the Christians; and everywhere they\r\nattempted to foment disorder so as to discredit the Young Turk rule\r\nas leading to a state of anarchy. But the Young Turks knew that the\r\npreservation of peace abroad and order at home was of vital importance,\r\nand they displayed a firmness that soon made their position stronger\r\nthan it had ever been.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, so as to overawe the reactionary party and the\r\nuntrustworthy Yildiz soldiery, they garrisoned the capital with a large\r\nforce of Macedonian troops loyal to the Constitution, who could be\r\nrelied upon to suppress a rising in the firmest manner. Loyal troops\r\nwere also employed to police the city; all reactionary assemblies were\r\nstopped and the agitators were cast into prison.\r\n\r\nThe machinations of the reactionaries, however, produced some effect.\r\nFor a considerable time Constantinople was in an overwrought and\r\nnervous condition, and various incidents inspired the Christian\r\ninhabitants with a great dread of impending peril. These Greeks,\r\nArmenians, Levantines, and others, timid of nature after their ages\r\nof oppression, suffered from an epidemic of panic, acute fits of which\r\nwere daily brought about by very small causes. Thus, one day at about\r\nthis time, as I was walking through the Grand Bazaar in Stamboul I\r\nwitnessed the following incident which showed the jumpy condition of\r\nthe population. A man, revolver in hand, chased by soldiers and others,\r\nsuddenly appeared, running at full speed through the crowded lanes\r\nof the Bazaar. This was quite enough to start a panic. Like wildfire\r\nspread the report that the Moslem mob, stirred up by the Softas, had\r\nat last commenced the massacre of the Christians. The scene was indeed\r\nan extraordinary one. Men and women turned pallid, wrung their hands,\r\nwept and howled, and there was a general stampede for the shelter\r\nof the houses. People ran into their own or other shops, doors were\r\nbolted, bars were drawn, shutters were closed, and in a trice what had\r\nbeen a busy mart had become empty and silent as a city of the dead,\r\nand remained so until Sami Pasha, the Minister of Police, came down to\r\nreassure the frightened Greek and Armenian traders. It turned out that\r\nthe origin of this widespread panic was merely the endeavouring of a\r\nvender of contraband tobacco to escape from the soldiers who had been\r\nsent to arrest him.\r\n\r\nOn another morning the terrifying rumour spread from end to end of the\r\ncity that the Second Division of the Imperial Guard, stationed at the\r\nTashkishla Barracks, outside the Yildiz Palace, had mutinied under\r\nthe leadership of the reactionaries, and were engaged in a sanguinary\r\nstruggle with the Constitutional troops from Salonica. The facts had\r\nbeen grossly exaggerated but the incident was significant enough.\r\nThis Second Division of the Imperial Guard, about seven thousand\r\nstrong, including the Sultan’s faithful Albanian Body-guard, had\r\nfor its post the neighbourhood of the Yildiz Palace. These troops,\r\nofficered by men risen from their own ranks, who protected the person\r\nof the Sultan, had been ever pampered and spoilt; their discipline\r\nwas very slack, and their loyalty to the Constitution was doubtful.\r\nConsequently the Minister of War, who by virtue of a recent _Iradé_\r\nwas empowered for the first time to despatch the regiments of this\r\nfavoured Division to any part of the Empire, decided to remove by\r\ndegrees from Constantinople some of the battalions of the Division and\r\nto replace them with loyal, well-disciplined troops from Salonica. So\r\nin the first place two battalions of the Yildiz Guards, to the great\r\ndisgust of the men, were ordered to those disagreeable stations, the\r\nHedjaz and Yemen, in distant Arabia, where they could work no mischief.\r\nEighty-eight of the men, who had but three months more to serve with\r\nthe colours, claimed their immediate discharge and clamoured to be sent\r\nto their homes. As this request was not granted they mutinied and,\r\ncoming out of their barracks, fired upon the Salonica troops who had\r\ncome to replace them. The fire was returned, three sergeants among the\r\nmutineers were shot dead, others were wounded, and the remainder were\r\ncaptured. The Commandant of the Guards Corps then called out several\r\nregiments of the Guards, formed them in a hollow square, and addressed\r\nthem briefly, explaining to them that the Government, while determined\r\nto improve the lot of all Turkish soldiers, would punish severely any\r\nact of indiscipline. The prisoners, many of whom begged for mercy,\r\ncrying out that they had been led astray by others, were brought within\r\nthe square, and the Commandant told them that they would be tried by\r\ncourt-martial. The ringleaders were afterwards shot. The troops of the\r\nImperial Guard on numerous previous occasions had displayed a similar\r\nmutinous spirit, but the timid authorities had always overlooked the\r\nmost flagrant breaches of discipline and yielded to the clamour of the\r\nmen. The prompt and firm action taken by the Minister of War on this\r\noccasion cut short what might have developed into a serious revolt, and\r\nreassured the timid civilian population. It was recognised that this\r\nwas no time for those in power to display weakness.\r\n\r\nThe Palace troops had thus been taught a useful lesson, and the\r\nCommittee of Union and Progress still further secured its position\r\nby seeing to it that the bulk of the Imperial Guards battalions were\r\nscattered in sections over different parts of the Empire. Moreover,\r\nthe General commanding the Second Division, a friend of the Sultan’s,\r\nwas forced to retire from the army, and the command was given to\r\nan officer known to be loyal to the Constitution. Steps were also\r\ntaken to introduce a better class of officers into the remaining\r\nYildiz regiments. The Committee showed that it was determined to be\r\nthe master. The General commanding the Cavalry Division of Guards\r\nand several other officers were imprisoned for agitating against the\r\nproposed supersession of officers who had been promoted from the ranks\r\nby those who had passed through the military academies; and other\r\nofficers of the Yildiz garrison were severely punished for attempting\r\nto cause disaffection among the rank and file in the interests of the\r\nreactionary party. The Committee won the admiration and confidence of\r\nall right-thinking men by the way in which it exercised its great power\r\nfor the country’s good.\r\n\r\nIt was very interesting to be in Constantinople during that critical\r\ntime and to watch the replacement of the old order of things by\r\nthe new, to see constitutional government developing itself before\r\none’s eyes within the space of days instead of centuries. Everywhere\r\none could contemplate the old and new facing each other in strong\r\ncontrast, and to attend, as I did on the Friday following the military\r\nmutiny, the Selamlik in the morning and visit the head-quarters of\r\nthe Committee of Union and Progress in the afternoon, was to rush, as\r\nit were, on Mr. Wells’ “time machine,” from the Middle Ages to the\r\ntwentieth century.\r\n\r\nEvery tourist who visits Constantinople has witnessed the Selamlik,\r\nthe Sultan’s procession from the Yildiz Palace on each Friday to\r\nworship at the Hamidieh Mosque, and the ceremony has been described\r\nmany times. This particular Friday’s ceremony had a special interest,\r\nand the spectacle was one to make one think. I joined the throng of\r\nforeigners at the gates of the Yildiz, and awaited the passing of the\r\nprocession. Here, from the steep hill, there is a beautiful view which\r\nforms a wonderful setting to the solemn function. In the immediate\r\nforeground, but a couple of hundred yards or so distant, is the white\r\nmosque itself; to the right stretch the heights on which Pera stands;\r\nbelow is the gleaming Bosphorus; and beyond it are the misty mountains\r\nof Asia, forming a noble background to the scene. There was much of\r\ninterest to look upon as one awaited the coming out of the Sultan—among\r\nother things the gathering of the picturesque Moslem crowd; the\r\narrival of successive detachments of troops with bands playing and\r\ncolours flying in the breeze; and the massing of the troops along the\r\nshort line of route and on the open space beyond. A greater number of\r\ntroops than usual, about eight thousand men, were brought out on this\r\noccasion, and after the ceremony they were paraded and marched to the\r\nPalace, at a window of which the Sultan stood and acknowledged their\r\nsalute. I watched the troops of all arms march up to the Palace, the\r\ntough-looking, red-fezzed, blue-coated Infantry of the Line, Artillery,\r\nCavalry, Marines, and Engineers. There were troops, too, from every\r\npart of the Ottoman Empire, including the fierce and faithful Albanians\r\nof the Prætorian Guard, in white uniforms fashioned after their\r\nnational dress, with wicked-looking yataghans slung across their\r\nwaists; and Arabian troops in queer uniforms and green turbans; and\r\nthey looked like what they indeed are, as formidable as any soldiery\r\nin the world when properly trained and led. It was a sign of the times\r\nthat the first regimental band to arrive on the scene began to play,\r\nnot the National Anthem, but the “March of Liberty,” which had been\r\ncomposed specially for the troops of the new _régime_, and the sound\r\nof it must have been scarcely pleasing to some ears within the Palace\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nAt last the _muezzin_ from the minaret of the mosque chanted the call\r\nof the faithful to prayer, and the procession, passing through the\r\nPalace gates, slowly proceeded down the steep road, between the troops,\r\nto the entrance of the mosque, the Sultan’s approach being announced by\r\nthe blowing of a trumpet and the shouting by the soldiers “_Padishahim\r\nchok yasha!_” (“long live the Emperor!”). I need not describe the\r\nwell-known scene; there were, as usual, the officers in gorgeous\r\nuniforms; high officials of the Palace and the Government, among whom\r\none recognised some few of the old _régime_, but none of the notorious\r\ninstruments of oppression and cruelty, or the corrupt advisers who\r\nhad ruined their country (for, happily, all these had gone, some\r\nhaving fled from the people’s wrath to England, others living under\r\nclose watch on the island of Prinkipo, and others prisoners in the\r\nSeraskeriat); the led saddle horses; the white-veiled Mohammedan ladies\r\nof the Palace in close carriages; the ungainly black eunuchs walking\r\nwith folded arms, not so insolent as of old, and no doubt fearful as\r\nto what might happen to them under the new _régime_ which had done\r\naway with their mischievous influence; and lastly, escorted by mounted\r\ntroops, in an open carriage, with the Grand Vizier facing him, came he\r\nwho is the head of the Moslem world, the nominal ruler of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire, the Sultan Abdul Hamid himself, his face imperturbable as he\r\nacknowledged the salute and trained acclamation of his legionaries. But\r\nit was a procession in which one seemed to be looking at the shadow of\r\nthat from which Turkey has now delivered herself; one felt that all\r\nthis pomp was but the empty shell of that which is now a dead thing.\r\n\r\nThen, in the afternoon, I visited the head-quarters of the Young\r\nTurk party in Stamboul. Having crossed the Golden Horn by the Galata\r\nBridge, and traversed the intricate lanes of the Grand Bazaar, I came\r\nto a quiet street of somewhat mean appearance, and in an unpretentious\r\nhouse, almost bare of furniture, I found the temporary meeting-place\r\nof the Committee of Union and Progress, the virtual Government of\r\nthe Ottoman Empire. Here there was no pomp or ceremony; one might\r\nhave been in the offices of some struggling architect in a third-rate\r\nLondon suburb. There was a room in which members of the organisation\r\nmet in an informal manner to discuss their plans, and to put forth\r\nthose suggestions which had to be obeyed by the ministers. There were\r\nother rooms in which men awaited their turn to have interviews with\r\nmembers of the Committee, and chambers in which one might carry on long\r\nconversations, as I did on several occasions, with courteous Young\r\nTurks ready to impart all such information regarding this wonderful\r\nmovement as it was not deemed inexpedient to divulge.\r\n\r\nI found these young Mussulmans who had freed Turkey quite unlike the\r\nconventional conspirators and revolutionaries. These were well-educated\r\nand thoughtful men, keen and energetic, with the light of resolve and\r\ngreat hope in their eyes betraying the enthusiasm which lay under their\r\nTurkish reserve and phlegm. The more I saw of the Young Turks the\r\nmore I was impressed by their patriotism, their manliness, and their\r\nsincerity. There are naturally some over-confident Chauvinists in the\r\nparty, but the bulk are men of shrewd common sense, as has been made\r\nmanifest to the world by their moderation after victory, and their\r\ntactful methods of conducting the government of a disorganised country,\r\nand maintaining order throughout the Empire in the face of tremendous\r\ndifficulties of every description.\r\n\r\nAll the members of the Committee of Union and Progress with whom I came\r\ninto contact, whether in the capital or in Salonica, whether soldiers\r\nor civilians, were enlightened men, most of whom had travelled and\r\nstudied in Western Europe, and had assimilated what is best of Western\r\nculture. Thus among the civilian members of the Committee are men\r\nwho would gain distinction in any country, such as Ahmed Riza, for\r\nmany years the chief organiser of the Young Turk movement in Paris,\r\nthe President of the Chamber; Djavid Bey, the professor; Aassim Bey,\r\nthe strenuous editor of the _Shura-i-Ummet_, the official organ of\r\nthe Committee, who took a leading part in preparing the revolution\r\nin Salonica; Rahmi Bey, a wealthy Salonican who was long in exile, a\r\ndescendant of the Saracen warrior who conquered Thessalonica from the\r\nLatins five hundred years ago. The military members of the Committee,\r\nofficers of the _état-major_, have passed through the military schools,\r\nor have been educated in France or Germany, and most of them, like the\r\ncivilian members, speak foreign languages. Among them are distinguished\r\nmen like Colonel Faik Bey, and Enver Bey, now the popular hero of the\r\nTurks. Another member of the Committee is Turkey’s ablest artillery\r\nofficer, General Hassan Riza Pasha, an old friend of mine in a way,\r\nfor I discovered, on talking to him, that he was with the Epirus army\r\nduring the Greek war, and that it was under the uncomfortable fire of\r\nhis guns that I remained with the eccentric, but harmless, Greek army\r\non the heights of Arta, and on one occasion narrowly escaped being\r\nkilled by one of his shells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n_PREPARING FOR SELF-RULE_\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the interregnum the most important task that had to be\r\nundertaken by the Committee of Union and Progress, and one that caused\r\nit a good deal of anxiety for a while, was the preparation of the\r\ncountry for the coming general election of the members of Turkey’s new\r\nParliament. It could not but be a dangerous experiment thus suddenly to\r\ngive self-governing institutions to the ignorant Ottoman masses, who\r\nhad endured thirty years of the worst of despotisms. It would naturally\r\ntake long to make the peasantry understand that under the new order of\r\nthings taxation would not be as it was under the old, that the money\r\nsupplied by the people would be spent in reorganising and developing\r\nthe country to their own great benefit. All that they knew of taxation\r\nwas that it had been wrung from them to enrich the ruling clique, that\r\nConstantinople swallowed up the huge sums which were collected in every\r\npart of the Empire, and that little had been done for the people. It\r\nwas difficult to convince them that taxation could possibly be for\r\ntheir own good. To quote from an article which appeared at the time\r\nin a Constantinople paper: “Persuasion in this case will be of no\r\navail. Acts must precede arguments. Let works of public utility, roads,\r\nrailways, harbours, irrigation canals, be undertaken at once. Let the\r\npolice be organised. Let the troops in the provinces receive their pay\r\nand be given their proper clothing and equipment as in the capital.” If\r\nthey beheld these changes, so advantageous to themselves, the people\r\nwould no doubt gradually lose their profound distrust of everything\r\nconnected with the administration of the State and realise that the\r\nsacrifices entailed by taxation might mean the return to the taxpayers,\r\nin the form of various benefits, of ten-fold what they had contributed.\r\nWhen the elections did take place it was found that great numbers of\r\nthe poorer and more ignorant peasants, though as taxpayers entitled to\r\nvote, refrained from exercising their right, for they suspected the\r\nneedful registration of being in some way connected with the exaction\r\nof further taxation.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, people, prejudiced against all outward form of\r\ngovernment and wholly ignorant of the elements of economics, suddenly\r\nfound themselves the free electors of a representative assembly. Many\r\npeople looked forward to the opening of the Parliament with grave\r\nmisgivings. It is rankest heresy in these days to give utterance to\r\nsuch a sentiment, but one could not help thinking last autumn, when\r\nthe result of the elections was still in doubt, that it might have\r\nbeen better to have continued the rule of the country for some time\r\nlonger through a Ministry selected by the Young Turk oligarchy,\r\nand not to have conferred self-governing institutions on the people\r\nuntil these had been to some extent educated by the object-lessons of\r\ngood government presented to them—the suppression of corruption, the\r\nefficiency of public departments, the bringing of prosperity to the\r\nwasted land, the wise expenditure on public works.\r\n\r\nBut it had been decreed that the Parliament should meet as soon as\r\npossible, so the Committee of Union and Progress set itself to teach\r\nthe electorate the duties of citizenship, to explain to them what\r\nconstitutional government meant, and to employ its wide-reaching\r\norganisation to secure so strong a representation of its nominees in\r\nthe Lower House as to give the Committee the control of affairs. The\r\nYoung Turks were too wise to be over-confident. They realised the\r\ndifficulties and dangers before them. They knew that the reactionaries\r\nwere intriguing everywhere and would seize their chance when they\r\ngot it. The Young Turks remained on their guard, determined that the\r\nliberty so hardly won should not be wrested from Turkey as it was in\r\n1878, and that if the Turkish Parliament failed as the Russian Duma\r\nfailed, it should not be to make way for the return of the Despotism.\r\n\r\nIt was recognised that, far from losing its _raison d’être_ with the\r\nopening of Parliament, the Young Turk organisation would be needed more\r\nthan ever for the protection of the country, and would have to continue\r\nits existence, with the army behind it as heretofore, for a long while\r\nto come. The Committee of Union and Progress therefore held a Congress\r\nin Salonica in October, at which measures were taken to strengthen\r\nand effect the closer knitting together of the Young Turk party. It\r\nwas arranged that all the Deputies in the Turkish Parliament who were\r\nnominees of the Committee should pledge themselves to support in its\r\nentirety the programme laid down by the Committee. Arrangements were\r\nmade for the establishment of close relations between the Committee and\r\nthe Army. The secret Central Committee, the names of whose members are\r\nunknown to the outer world, was re-elected at the Congress, but it was\r\ndecided that it should no longer have its head-quarters in Salonica and\r\nthat it should not hold its meetings in Constantinople. It was to have\r\nno known or fixed habitation. The Young Turks, therefore, apparently\r\ndeemed it more necessary than ever that strict secrecy should be\r\nobserved as to who their real leaders were. By this time the Committee\r\nhad largely extended its membership, its sworn associates numbering\r\nabout seventy thousand—all that was best of the Ottoman manhood.\r\n\r\nAs the result of the electoral campaign conducted by the Committee\r\nof Union and Progress their nominees are in an overwhelming majority\r\nin the Turkish House of Commons, voting as one man on all important\r\nquestions. The Constitution arranged for the creation of a Senate,\r\nor Second Chamber, composed of notables selected by the Sultan.\r\nThe Committee saw to it that the Senate should not become the\r\nhead-quarters of reaction. It presented a list of names to the Sultan,\r\nwho was pleased to appoint as Senators the persons thus suggested to\r\nhim. A parliament, the bulk of whose members are sworn to obey the\r\nbidding of a secret society, may not be an ideal form of government;\r\nbut there can be little doubt that it was the best possible one for\r\nTurkey during the early days of the new _régime_, when it was necessary\r\nfor the very existence of the Empire that one strong and patriotic\r\nparty should dominate the House and present a united front to foreign\r\nfoe and home reactionary. It was no time for parliamentary dissensions,\r\nfor the raising of delicate questions concerning the future position\r\nof the various races, with their conflicting aspirations, or for the\r\ndiscussion of the schemes of thorough-going decentralisation advocated\r\nby the too broad-minded theorists who would grant home rule all round\r\nto Turkey’s various peoples.\r\n\r\nThe Turks were novices at political combination, whereas the Greeks\r\nwere skilled in electioneering trickery of every sort and were\r\ndetermined to obtain as large an electioneering representation as\r\npossible in Parliament. The Greeks undoubtedly entertained the opinion\r\nthat, representing the brains and commercial wealth of Turkey, they\r\nshould take a leading place, above all the other elements of the\r\npopulation, in the administration of the country. The Committee of\r\nUnion and Progress was not of this opinion, and under its guidance the\r\nvotes of the Mussulmans, largely supported by the Armenian and Jewish\r\nvote, secured the ascendency of the ruling race in Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt is a fortunate thing for Turkey that the people who conquered\r\nthis land will still maintain their political supremacy under the\r\nConstitution. The situation would be a dangerous one, indeed, were\r\nthe Greek vote ever to swamp that of the Mussulmans at the elections.\r\nAnother revolution, not of so bloodless a character as the last,\r\nwould be the probable result. It is obvious that for the Caliph, the\r\nhead of the Mussulman faith, to be under the direction of a Christian\r\nGovernment would be intolerable to the millions of fanatical Moslem\r\nsubjects of the Porte in Asia, who already regard the Constitution\r\nwith great suspicion. It is absurd to suppose, too, that the Young\r\nTurk party and the Mussulman Turkish army have overthrown despotism\r\nonly to hand over the rule of the country to what, for centuries, have\r\nbeen the subject races. The Turks hold the inconsistent, but perfectly\r\njustifiable, point of view that all Ottomans, of whatever race and\r\ncreed, shall have equal rights, but that the predominance of the\r\nMussulman Turks must be safeguarded. This may not be logic, but it is\r\ncommon sense.\r\n\r\nThe opinions and misgivings of the Young Turks, while the elections\r\nwere in progress, were expressed as follows, in an article which\r\nappeared in one of their organs in the capital: “The Mussulman element\r\nis the one which, above all others, works to maintain the Empire’s\r\nsafety and integrity. The other elements have, more or less, other\r\nends in view. If we now deliver the government of the country into\r\nthe hands of the non-Mussulmans, who can suppose that these would\r\nhave Ottoman interests as their one aim? It is evident, therefore,\r\nthat under present conditions, if we wish to safeguard our national\r\nexistence, we must keep the government in our own hands, and be on\r\nthe watch lest the other elements snatch it from us. But it must not\r\nbe gathered from the opinions which we have thus expressed that we\r\nintend to refuse to place the other elements on the same footing of\r\nequality as the Mussulman element—that we wish to deprive them of their\r\npolitical rights. To make sure of a majority in the Parliament is a\r\nquestion of life and death for the Turks. It will not do for us to\r\ntake it for granted that the Turks are certain to obtain a majority in\r\nParliament because they compose a majority of the population. We state\r\nit with regret, that the bulk of the Mussulmans, not realising the\r\nimportance of the elections, have not even taken the trouble to vote,\r\nand that those who have voted have not come to an understanding with\r\neach other, and have, therefore, failed to send an adequate number of\r\nDeputies to the Chamber. It would be interesting to know what line of\r\naction we ought to adopt if we found ourselves in a Chamber containing\r\na majority of non-Mussulman Deputies. The laws made by such a Chamber\r\nwould not favour the dominant element. Let us suppose, for example,\r\nthat the Greeks were in a strong majority in the Ottoman Parliament,\r\nand that the question of the annexation of Crete to Greece was\r\nunder discussion. How many Greek Deputies would disapprove of that\r\nannexation? And again, if the Bulgarians had the majority, what would\r\nhappen to Macedonia? The Turks, who conquered the country at the cost\r\nof a great sacrifice, have proved that, with regard to the position\r\nof the other elements, they are guided by the sentiments of equality,\r\njustice, and liberty, but they will not tolerate the formation of a\r\nState within a State. Our non-Mussulman compatriots, who desire to live\r\nas brothers with the Mussulmans, must calmly examine their hearts and\r\nconsciences. Let them have the courage to tear from their hearts all\r\nideas—if they entertain such—which are prejudicial to the interests of\r\nthe Turkish rule, and let them, without fear, throw themselves into\r\nour arms. They have nothing to fear from us; all that is asked of them\r\nis that they make us believe in their sincerity. But, whatever may be\r\nsaid in this country, it is the Turks who compose, and who will always\r\ncompose, the dominant element.”\r\n\r\nThe Committee, therefore, set itself diligently to work to secure the\r\nascendency of its adherents in Parliament. It selected as its nominees\r\nthe best men it could find, who commanded the respect of the people,\r\nfor the most part professional men in towns, and landed proprietors\r\nin the country; and it undertook the education of the voters in the\r\nexercise of their new privileges. It sent missionaries throughout the\r\ncountry to preach the cause of the Constitution, and to confute the\r\narguments of the reactionary agents. It founded schools of political\r\ninstruction in the villages. Its lecturers addressed attentive crowds\r\nin city streets. Even the theatres were used for the dissemination of\r\npolitical doctrines, and both in Constantinople and Salonica I attended\r\nplays written with the object of showing the horrors of the Despotism\r\nand the blessings of liberty under constitutional government.\r\n\r\nOne night I visited a Turkish theatre in Pera, where a company of\r\namateurs—Young Turks, several of whom were officers in the army,\r\nwhilst the others had either recently been released from prison or\r\nhad returned from exile—presented a patriotic play entitled “The\r\nAwakening of Turkey.” In this remarkable play, though fictitious names\r\nappeared on the programme, nearly all the characters impersonated were\r\nwell-known men, creatures of the Palace, reformers, and others, and\r\nwhenever an actor appeared on the scene so good was his make-up that\r\nthe audience at once knew who was intended, and received him with warm\r\napplause or cries and groans of execration, as the case might be. The\r\nplay opened with a sort of prologue—“the Pasha’s dream.” The curtain\r\nrose and disclosed a room in which a white-bearded old man was sleeping\r\nin an arm-chair. He was recognised by the audience as a well-known\r\nvictim of the Despotism. The Pasha, as he slept, dreamt a vivid dream,\r\nwhich now unfolded itself before us. The back of the room faded away,\r\nand we looked into the interior of a luxuriously furnished chamber\r\nin the Yildiz Palace. And here, in dumb show, were enacted before us\r\nsome of the evil doings of the Camarilla that is no more. There we saw,\r\nmade up to the life, the Sultan’s hated secretary, Izzet Pasha, and to\r\njudge from his reception by the audience he is safer in his English\r\nhouse than he would be in Constantinople. There, too, were the Sultan’s\r\naged astrologer, Abdul Houda, and other Court favourites. Spies came\r\nin with lists of denounced reformers, and orders for execution or\r\nfor the _oubliette_ were signed. The tyrants bethought themselves\r\nto seek recreation in the intervals of their cruel business, so the\r\nhideous and fawning black eunuchs were ordered to bring in a troupe of\r\nbeautiful Armenian dancing girls. A young Turk in chains was led in,\r\ntortures were applied to him in vain to wring from him the betrayal\r\nof his associates; so he was put to death there and then by the\r\nCourt executioner, in the presence of his wife, who was on her knees\r\nimploring for mercy, and frantic with grief, while the callous Court\r\nfavourites, with scarce a side glance at the bloody deed, continued\r\nto gaze with gloating eyes at the dance of the slave girls. Then a\r\nmessenger came in with news that was evidently of importance. He opened\r\nthe box which he had brought with him, and to the joy of the courtiers\r\ndrew out the bleeding head of the murdered Midhat Pasha.\r\n\r\nThen the vision faded away, and the Pasha awoke from his nightmare.\r\nIt had deeply affected him, and in a long speech he announced his\r\nintention of fleeing from Turkey to Paris in order that he might\r\nhelp to organise the revolution by which Turkey must be saved. His\r\nson entered, was delighted to hear the Pasha’s resolve, and agreed\r\nto accompany him. The scenes of the play itself were laid in Paris.\r\nWe heard plots being arranged by spies in the Turkish Embassy in the\r\nFrench capital, and saw them circumvented by an _attaché_ of the\r\nEmbassy, who happened to be a secret adherent of the Young Turk party.\r\nWe witnessed the deathbed of the Pasha, who had abandoned wife and\r\nproperty for the sake of his country, and who, in a long speech, urged\r\nhis son to persevere in the good work. We were taken to a Mussulman\r\nburial ground, where an eloquent funeral oration was delivered over\r\nthe remains of the dead patriot, and we witnessed his apotheosis when\r\nangels bore him upwards to Paradise. The final scene represented a\r\nsomewhat extraordinary entertainment at the Turkish Embassy, where a\r\ngood deal of champagne was being drunk; suddenly, in rushed a newsboy\r\ncarrying a poster announcing the proclamation of the Constitution; and\r\nthe curtain dropped on the group of revelling spies, now overwhelmed\r\nwith fear and consternation.\r\n\r\nIt was a gloomy play, mainly made up of long and earnest monologues,\r\nlit up occasionally with flashes of grim humour, but its effect upon\r\nthe audience was extraordinary. The actors who represented the friends\r\nof liberty delivered, with great oratorical power, eloquent speeches,\r\nin which they preached the righteousness of the cause, and the beauty\r\nof sacrifice of self for the fatherland. They swayed the audience as\r\nthey willed; for these were not merely clever actors who felt their\r\nparts, but men who had done, and were still doing, in real life, the\r\nthings that they represented upon the stage. The audience hung upon\r\ntheir words, warmly applauded the patriotic sentiments, and showed\r\ntheir detestation of the tyrants and their pity for the sufferers.\r\nThere were tears in the eyes of many men present, to whom, no doubt,\r\nthe play recalled bitter memories. The audience was mostly exclusively\r\ncomposed of Mussulman Turks—soldiers, theological students, turbanned\r\n_hodjas_, and others. In the higher-priced seats were many officers of\r\nthe army and navy, and two near relatives of the Sultan were in the\r\nboxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n_A STRONG ARMY NEEDED_\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some time before the elections for the Turkish Parliament took\r\nplace, the Committee of Union and Progress was at great pains to\r\nexplain its programme as fully and clearly as was possible to the\r\npeople. From the articles which appeared in the newspapers of the\r\nparty and the conversations which could be had without difficulty\r\nwith members of the Committee one was able to form a fairly complete\r\nconception of the principal aims of the reformers. The title of the\r\nCommittee, “Union and Progress,” well sums up these aims. Turkey is to\r\nbe made strong and free, respected by the nations, first by _union_—by\r\nthe union of all natives of Turkey of whatsoever creed or race. They\r\nare to enjoy equal rights. No advantage is to be given to any religion.\r\nThe Young Turks announced that this tolerance was not to be merely\r\na passive one, that where Christian populations had no churches or\r\nschools these would be provided for them at the expense of the State,\r\nand that in these schools the teaching of such national languages as\r\nAlbanian or Servian would be permitted. In the second place, Turkey is\r\nto be made strong by _progress_—the regeneration of a people whose\r\nenergies have been sterilised by a long oppression, the restoration of\r\nprosperity to an impoverished land. The people are to be educated, and\r\nthe vast resources of the country are to be developed.\r\n\r\nInstead of dreaming of impossible social reforms, the Young Turks have\r\nvery practical ends in view. In the first place, they recognise that\r\nit is essential to the existence of Turkey that she should possess\r\na strong army, as otherwise her very progress may prove her ruin,\r\narousing the cupidity of those of her neighbours who have already\r\ndivided among them so much of her rich land. So Turkey, having no\r\ndesire to sow that others may reap, is determined to create an army\r\nequal in strength to that of any of the great military Powers. To\r\npossess such an army the Turks are prepared to make great sacrifices.\r\nThe exemption from conscription enjoyed by certain cities and districts\r\nwill be withdrawn gradually. The Moslems will no longer bear the whole\r\nburden of the conscription; for the future the Christians also will\r\nhave to serve in the army, and the view of the Turkish Generals with\r\nwhom I have spoken is that there should be no formation of exclusively\r\nMoslem or exclusively Christian regiments, but that men of different\r\ncreeds should be mingled in each unit. The Greeks, who want all the\r\nrights of Ottoman citizenship without its obligations, entertain a\r\nstrong objection to service in the Turkish army.\r\n\r\nBut Turkey cannot maintain a great army without money, and money\r\nshe can only obtain by developing her vast mineral and agricultural\r\nresources with foreign capital. Under the old _régime_, Court intrigue\r\nmade all industrial enterprise precarious, and foreign capitalists\r\nwere chary of ventures in a country where rights of property were so\r\ninsecure. But by means of the good government which the Young Turks are\r\nintroducing they hope to gain the confidence of foreign investors. They\r\nrealise that, to quote from a Constantinople paper, “Turkey cannot have\r\nreform without money or money without reform; foreign capital she must\r\nhave in order to carry out the reforms, and foreign capital will not\r\ncome in until there is a satisfactory assurance that the reforms will\r\nbe carried out, that the money provided will be spent properly and not\r\nbe stolen and wasted as it was under the old _régime_.”\r\n\r\nThe programme of the more necessary reforms was set forth with\r\nsome detail by the press of the Young Turk party during its\r\nelectioneering campaign, and the abolition of the old corrupt system of\r\nadministration, whereby bribery and _bakshish_ had to supplement the\r\ninadequate pay—often years in arrears—of the servants of the State, was\r\nof course insisted upon. The following are among the more important of\r\nthe projects recommended by the Young Turk party: (1) The construction\r\nof many thousands of miles of roads to open out the country; at the\r\npresent time some of the railway lines are of very little service,\r\nas roads to bring to them the produce of the neighbouring country\r\nat moderate cost are wanting. (2) The construction of four thousand\r\nkilometres of railway; certain railways are urgently needed if\r\nthe enormous mineral wealth of the country is to be developed by\r\nforeign capital; the difficulties of transport now prohibit mining\r\nenterprise in most richly mineralised districts. (3) The bringing under\r\ncultivation again of the formerly productive arable districts in the\r\nVilayets of Salonica, Smyrna, etc. (4) The construction of commercial\r\nports at Dedeaghatch, Samsoun, Mersina, etc. (5) The construction of\r\nirrigation works in Mesopotamia and elsewhere; there are thousands of\r\nsquare miles of uncultivated land in Turkey only awaiting irrigation to\r\nmake them exceedingly productive. (6) The engaging of French engineers\r\nto make navigable waterways of the Vardar, Maritza, Boyana, and\r\nKizil-Irmak. (7) The foundation of an engineering college, coupled with\r\na scheme for sending students who have gained diplomas to Europe to\r\ngain practical knowledge. (8) The formation of navigation, commercial,\r\nand industrial companies, with the object of forwarding the prosperity\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nIt is outside the scope of this book to deal with the complicated\r\nquestion of Turkey’s financial position, which, according to the\r\nexperts, is not so unsatisfactory as was at first supposed; but there\r\nare, of course, immense difficulties to be overcome before Turkey can\r\nsee herself fairly started on the road of progress. The late _régime_\r\nburdened her with obligations which stand in the way of all attempts\r\nat reform; but these obstacles might be removed by the co-operation\r\nof the Powers interested. Whenever some measure for Turkey’s good is\r\nproposed there seems to jump up some capitulation or some privileged\r\ninterest of one Power or another to block it hopelessly. The Baghdad\r\nRailway concession, for example, with its kilometric guarantee, is like\r\na mill-stone round the neck of Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe Young Turks recognized that if their country was to be regenerated\r\nand to take its place among the nations the revenues would have to be\r\ngreatly increased with the least possible delay. As to ways and means,\r\nthe following may be taken as summing up some of the views which I\r\nheard expressed by Turks and others whose opinion carries weight. In\r\nthe first place (in view of the attitude taken by the more ignorant\r\nParliamentary electors, who maintained that under the Constitution\r\nno taxes could be demanded of them) it may be impolitic to make any\r\nincrease in the direct taxation of the country. The people, however,\r\nshould be compelled to pay such direct taxes as are now in force until\r\nsome better system has been devised, and the persons—and they are\r\nnumerous—who by exercise of undue influence or otherwise have succeeded\r\nin avoiding the payment of their taxes should be forced to contribute\r\nlike the others.\r\n\r\nIt is held, however, that whereas the direct taxes should be left as\r\nthey are, reforms being made in the method of collection, several new\r\nsources of revenue could be tapped in the way of indirect taxation. In\r\nthe first place, all the existing methods of raising indirect taxation\r\nshould be maintained in their integrity, while the revenue derived\r\nfrom them should be largely increased by administrative reforms. For\r\nexample, it has been calculated that the reorganisation of the Turkish\r\nCustoms under the advice of the English expert, Mr. Crawford, will\r\nincrease the revenue derived from the Customs by twenty-five per cent.\r\nThinking men in Turkey recommend, not only the maintenance of the\r\nexisting Customs tariff and other methods of indirect taxation, but\r\nalso the imposition of still heavier taxation of this description until\r\nTurkey has been extricated from her present financial difficulties;\r\nand they also favour the creation of several new monopolies, to be\r\npreceded, naturally, by an amelioration in the conditions of the\r\nexisting tobacco, salt, and other monopolies.\r\n\r\nThe very mention of monopolies is shocking to most economists,\r\nbut political economy is not an exact science, and there are many\r\nexceptions even to the most widely accepted of its rules. Turkey must\r\nhave money. The foreign capital necessary to develop her resources\r\nhesitates to come in, waiting to see its security. A monopoly affords\r\nthat security and tempts capital as nothing else will. The English\r\nbusiness men to whom I spoke in Turkey regarded the granting of\r\nmonopolies for comparatively short terms as expedient under the present\r\nconditions in Turkey; for not only does this fostering of large\r\nindustries provide employment for many people, but—what is of the\r\nutmost importance to Turkey at the present moment—it will also bring\r\nto the Turkish Government, without any expenditure on its part, an\r\nimmediate and considerable revenue.\r\n\r\nAs the time for the Parliamentary elections drew near the Committee of\r\nUnion and Progress published its political programme, and to this all\r\ncandidates who were nominees of the Committee were bound to adhere. The\r\nfollowing were among the more important of the Committee’s demands:\r\nthat the Cabinet should be responsible to the Chamber of Deputies; that\r\nTurkish should remain the official language of the Empire; that the\r\ndifferent races should have equal rights; that non-Moslems should be\r\nliable to military service; that the term of military service should be\r\nreduced; that peasants who had no land should be assisted to procure\r\nland, but not at the expense of the present land-owners; that education\r\nshould be free and compulsory.\r\n\r\nIt was deeply interesting to be in Turkey during the elections, to\r\nwatch the Young Turks zealously conducting their campaign to serve\r\nwhat they considered to be their country’s interests, and the people\r\nthemselves puzzling out the meaning of this new Western innovation,\r\nthe Constitution, and balancing the arguments of rival canvassers. The\r\nrepresentatives of the Committee of Union and Progress were prepared\r\nto discuss patiently the intentions of the party with any group of\r\nelectors that came to consult them, and while promising concessions\r\nto just demands, they did not attempt to catch votes by making wild\r\npromises which could never be fulfilled. Thus, when the Armenians—who\r\nhave proved their loyalty to the Constitution and have not harassed the\r\nGovernment with unjustifiable grievances—asked that the lands which\r\nhad been taken from the Armenians by the Kurds should be returned\r\nto the rightful owners, the Committee, realising that in practical\r\npolitics there must be a law of prescription even for the raider,\r\nand not wishing to have a Kurd question added to the numerous other\r\ndifficulties which were confronting Turkey, suggested that it would be\r\nwiser to leave the turbulent Kurds in possession of what they seized\r\nsome time ago and to compensate the Armenians by giving them at least\r\nequally good lands in the once productive tracts which have long been\r\nlying fallow and deserted. On the other hand, the Committee could not\r\nassent to the proposal of the Arabians that the use of the Arab tongue\r\nshould be permitted in the debates of the Chamber of Deputies. To\r\nChristians of all sects it promised that there would be no interference\r\nwith their churches, language, education, and laws of marriage\r\nand inheritance; but refused to consider the question of complete\r\nadministrative decentralisation, or of autonomy, for any portion of the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the agents of the reactionary party—the party of\r\nthose who had fattened under the old _régime_ of plunder and were loth\r\nto see the profitable abuses swept away—worked hard to influence the\r\nelectors, but apparently with little effect in European Turkey and\r\nAsia Minor. Certain foolish agitators who were infected with some of\r\nthe socialistic doctrines of Western Europe unwittingly helped the\r\ncause of the reactionaries by raising the election cry of “No more\r\ntaxes for the people” and “Down with all monopolies.” I have explained\r\nthat the more ignorant people thought that with the suppression of the\r\nlate _régime_ there would be an end of all authority. When they were\r\nenlightened on this matter by the Young Turks, and discovered that they\r\nwould be compelled to pay their taxes as heretofore they felt some\r\ndisappointment, and this afforded an opportunity to the reactionaries\r\nto point out to them that they would be no better off under the\r\nConstitution than they had been before, and that, at any rate, Turkey,\r\nunder the old _régime_, had been a Mussulman State, whereas under\r\nthe new order of things the government would be in the hands of bad\r\nMohammedans, Christians, and Jews.\r\n\r\nIn Arabia and in other parts of Asia the efforts of the friends of the\r\nold _régime_, as might be expected, were attended with some success.\r\nThe fanatical Arabs, who have never been reconciled to the Turkish\r\nrule, were impressed by the preachings of those who in the mosques\r\ndenounced the Constitution, and declared that the Turks, who had ever\r\nbeen indifferent Mussulmans, had now abandoned the essential doctrines\r\nof Islam and were worse than the Christians and Jews with whom they\r\nassociated.\r\n\r\nBut with the other races of the Empire it was still—in those early\r\ndays of liberty—harmony, fraternisation, and enthusiasm; the racial and\r\nreligious differences appeared to be forgotten for a while; one read\r\nof elections in which Christians were voting for Mussulman candidates\r\nor Mussulmans for Christian candidates. The optimistic Minister of the\r\nInterior, Haki Bey, made the following statement: “In our Parliament\r\nthere will be no Turkish, Armenian, Greek, or Jew Deputies; they will\r\nall be Ottoman Deputies.” If one judged from the appearance of the\r\nsurface one would have concluded that the proclaimed ideal of the Young\r\nTurk party—the union of people of all races and creeds within the\r\nEmpire—was in a fair way to being realised.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish election law—which is now being revised—defines so vaguely\r\nthe qualifications for a voter that a good deal of misunderstanding\r\narose. Thus the Greek farmers in Epirus clamoured for the franchise,\r\nwhich had been denied to them on the ground that they were not\r\ntaxpayers, the tithes being paid, not by them, but by the owners of\r\nthe land. The Greeks maintained that, as this tax is calculated on\r\nthe produce of the soil and not on the rent paid, the farmers were\r\nvirtually the taxpayers and therefore entitled to vote. To decide\r\nwhat constituted a taxpayer in the eyes of the election law must have\r\npuzzled the brains of many a Turkish official at this time, especially\r\nwhen he had before him some cunning and plausibly argumentative Greek,\r\ndetermined to have his vote by hook or by crook. In an amusing case\r\nwhich was brought before my notice an importunate person was allowed\r\nto vote in his capacity as a taxpayer, though the only proof that\r\nhe was such lay in the fact that he had on his back a coat made of\r\na foreign cloth, which, if not smuggled, must have contributed to\r\ntaxation in the form of Customs duties as it entered the country. The\r\nTurkish equivalents to English revising barristers had plenty of work\r\nto do in all the constituencies between Macedonia and Baghdad. It\r\nreminded one pleasingly of England to read of these things; but there\r\nwere differences to be noticed here and there between the British\r\nand Turkish frame of mind during a General Election. For example,\r\nthe Turkish electorate appears to be somewhat more exacting than the\r\nEnglish, and it was announced that at Gumuldjina the _imams_, carrying\r\nthe sacred banners from the mosques, assembled with ten thousand\r\nMohammedans in front of the Municipality, to protest against the\r\nnomination as parliamentary candidates of “_obscure and undistinguished\r\nindividuals_.”\r\n\r\nThe following are the more important features of the electoral\r\nregulations under the existing law. The elections are quadrennial.\r\nRoughly speaking fifty thousand voters are represented by one member\r\nof Parliament. There are two classes of electors; each group of about\r\nfive hundred electors of the first class selects an elector of the\r\nsecond class, and the electors of the second class nominate and elect\r\nthe Deputies. The following are among the qualifications for the\r\nfranchise: An elector must be a male Ottoman subject, over twenty-five\r\nyears of age; he must be a payer of direct taxes; he must have lived\r\na year in the district in which he exercises his right of voting, and\r\nmust produce a certificate from the _moukhtar_ of his former place of\r\ndomicile showing that he is entitled to vote; _employés_ of the State\r\nand officers in the army, from the rank of lieutenant upwards, have\r\nthe right to vote in whatever electoral districts they may happen to\r\nbe during the elections; soldiers on furlough can vote in their own\r\ndistricts. A man is disqualified from voting if he has been condemned\r\nfor a crime, if he is an undischarged bankrupt, if his character is\r\nnotoriously bad, if he is acting as servant to another individual, if\r\nhe has represented himself as being of other than Ottoman nationality.\r\nA Deputy must be over thirty years of age, must know the Turkish\r\nlanguage, and must possess the qualifications of an elector. A good\r\nmany of these regulations were not insisted on rigidly at the recent\r\nelections; for example, there are several Deputies who cannot speak\r\nTurkish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF SCUTARI]\r\n\r\nThe electoral laws provide heavy punishments for those who employ\r\nviolence, intimidation, or corruption at elections. By Article 72\r\nof the Constitution the penalty for influencing elections by false\r\nstatements and calumnies is a fine of forty pounds and a period of\r\nimprisonment of from one year up to five years, according to the\r\ngravity of the offence; so it would be a dangerous thing in Turkey for\r\npartisans to post the walls with cartoons such as those which have\r\nexerted no small influence at General Elections in England. Another\r\ncurious regulation, the object of which is to prevent rioting, compels\r\nthe elector to return to his home as soon as he has registered his\r\nvote. It is also laid down that electors, before they drop their voting\r\npapers into the urn, must attend the prayers of the _imam_ (or priest\r\nin the case of a Christian voter) for the prolongation of the Sultan’s\r\nlife and the increase of his glory.\r\n\r\nIn the late autumn, throughout the Turkish Empire, the elections\r\ntook place. Turks, Albanians, Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, Wallachs,\r\nArmenians, Jews, Latins, Arabs, Syrians, Kurds, Druses, elected their\r\nDeputies to a Chamber which represents so many races, interests,\r\ncreeds, and languages that Turkey’s new Parliament in all probability\r\nwould have been a Babel of vain talk and no doing had it not been that\r\nthe cause of the Committee of Union and Progress triumphed in European\r\nTurkey and in Anatolia, and secured many adherents in other parts of\r\nthe Empire, with the result that the nominees of the Committee formed a\r\nlarge majority in the Chamber.\r\n\r\nI was in Constantinople during the election operations, and very\r\ninteresting and picturesque they were. On the night preceding the\r\npolling the big drums were beating loudly in the Turkish quarters of\r\nthe capital to remind the electors that it was their duty as good\r\ncitizens of a free country to go on the morrow to the appointed places\r\nand drop their voting papers in the ballot boxes. On the following\r\nmorning the great city presented a very animated appearance. Large\r\nprocessions were formed to carry with due ceremony the urns, or ballot\r\nboxes, to the various mosques, Greek and Armenian churches, synagogues,\r\npolice stations, and other public buildings, in which the voting was to\r\ntake place. A typical Mussulman procession which passed me was composed\r\nas follows: First came a military band and a small escort of infantry;\r\nnext a carriage draped with Turkish flags, containing the voting urn\r\nand a few officials; lastly, a motley Mussulman crowd of voters and\r\nothers, including _imams_, accompanied by theological students, pupils\r\nof the artillery and naval academies and numbers of happy school\r\nchildren, conspicuous among which was a band of tiny Moslem girls,\r\nwearing veils and waving miniature Turkish flags as they toddled along\r\nby the side of some tall _gendarmes_ who brought up the rear of the\r\nprocession. This and the other processions which I met moved through\r\nthe crowded streets to the accompaniment of martial music, the singing\r\nof patriotic songs, occasional cheers for liberty and justice, and the\r\nwaving of many flags. These were, indeed, the most good-humoured and\r\nhappiest election demonstrations one remembers to have seen in any\r\ncountry; there were no party cries or manifestations of party feelings\r\nof any sort; all seemed to be thinking of the good of their country\r\nalone, and to be rejoicing in its liberation. The Greeks and Armenians\r\nhad similar processions, also headed by military bands (for these had\r\nbeen lent to all sections of the electorate by the authorities),\r\nand here, too, the priestly element was largely represented. At one\r\nmanifestation which I saw in Stamboul the Turk and Armenian electors\r\njoined forces, and there were to be seen in the combined procession\r\nMussulman _hodjas_ and Armenian priests in their full Mohammedan and\r\nChristian canonicals, walking hand in hand in amity. For a while\r\ngood-fellowship reigned everywhere in this city of rival creeds and\r\nraces. To judge from appearances it might have been concluded that\r\n“Fraternity,” which has been the watchword of all revolutions, has\r\nfor the first time in history been brought about in Turkey, of all\r\ncountries in the world.\r\n\r\nBut when the voting commenced it was made manifest that the brotherhood\r\nof creeds and races in Turkey had not yet been realised. The Turks,\r\nArmenians, Latins, Syrians, and Jews recorded their votes without\r\nany difficulties arising, and in many instances voted for the same\r\ncandidates. But the Greeks, who, according to the [OE]cumenical\r\nPatriarch, number one hundred and fifty thousand in Constantinople,\r\ncreated a good deal of disturbance, after the manner of their brethren\r\nin Athens on similar occasions. In many parts of Turkey the Greeks\r\ncomplained bitterly of the electoral irregularities which, so they\r\nalleged, had been committed at their expense, and rioting occurred\r\nin Smyrna and elsewhere. So the Greeks in the capital, protesting\r\nthat they had been very badly treated, organised noisy demonstrations\r\nwhich caused the elections to occupy several more days than had been\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nThe polling opened on a Friday, and it was made evident that the\r\nGreeks had come into the streets on the lookout for trouble. It was\r\nnoticeable that when a man of another race was not permitted to\r\nregister his vote on account of some irregularity in his papers or\r\nother disqualification, he went away quietly, whereas the Greeks in\r\nlike circumstances stayed to protest and bluster until they formed\r\ncrowds of disappointed voters who blocked the way to the urns, and\r\nby so doing considerably delayed the course of the election. On the\r\nfollowing morning the Greek leaders hurried about Pera collecting the\r\npeople, and ordered all the Greek shop-keepers to close their shops,\r\nwhich they promptly did. Others got into the belfries of the Greek\r\nchurches and rang the bells violently to summon the crowds, and soon\r\nthe main streets were packed with excited and clamouring men. Seeing\r\nthat they practically all carried revolvers and knives it is wonderful\r\nthat but few accidents occurred throughout the demonstration. The\r\nauthorities took due precautions. Certain points were occupied by\r\ntroops, and bodies of cavalry and infantry patrolled the streets, in\r\nno way interfering with the demonstration, but awing the demonstrators\r\nby their very presence, for the inhabitants of Constantinople knew\r\nof what stuff are made these soldiers who trooped slowly by, silent,\r\nstolid, apparently indifferent to all that was going on around them, in\r\nstriking contrast to the noisy rabble which gave way before them. On\r\nthe Sunday the church bells again rang out their appeal, and thirty\r\nthousand Greeks having assembled in Pera marched through Galata,\r\ncrossed the Golden Horn by the bridge of boats and came to the Sublime\r\nPorte, where they insisted that the Grand Vizier himself, Kiamil Pasha,\r\nshould come out to speak to them. When that aged statesman did appear\r\nto explain that full justice would be done to them by Parliament should\r\nthey be able to show that the alleged irregularities had occurred,\r\nthese people, who but a few months before were afraid to open their\r\nmouths if any representative of the dreaded Government was near,\r\ninsulted Kiamil Pasha by shouting out to him that his verbal assurances\r\nwould not suffice for them, and that they must have his undertaking\r\nin writing. This attitude, of course, brought the conference to an\r\nend, and the Grand Vizier retired. It became necessary later to\r\nemploy the cavalry to clear the streets, but, wonderful to say, only\r\ntwo casualties, and these slight ones, were reported for this day.\r\nThe troops displayed a great forbearance and behaved admirably under\r\nconditions calculated to try their temper.\r\n\r\nObserving the indignation and distress of the Greeks, one would have\r\nsupposed that they had been very badly treated. As a matter of fact\r\ntheir clamour was chiefly caused by disappointment at the failure of\r\ntheir scheme to obtain a much larger representation in Parliament than\r\ntheir numbers warranted. Their point of view was that the Greek element\r\nof the Turkish population, being the most civilised and cultured, was\r\nthe best fitted to undertake the Government of the country, and, being\r\nGreeks, they considered that any means were fair which could forward\r\ntheir aim. The Greeks are the only people in Turkey who understand\r\nelection trickery, and they were assisted in their recent campaign\r\nby clever and, of course, absolutely unscrupulous electioneering\r\nexperts from Athens. Taking advantage of the ignorance of the lower\r\nclass Moslems they obtained votes by various fraudulent devices and\r\nmisrepresentation. The Greeks flocked to the polls whether they were\r\nentitled to a vote or not. Impersonation both of the living and the\r\ndead was largely practised. In Turkey, each voter, on coming up to the\r\nvoting place, has to show his _hamidieh_—the official paper testifying\r\nto Ottoman nationality and date of birth. It was discovered that Greeks\r\nnot entitled to the vote had been provided with the _hamidiehs_ of dead\r\nmen and of people who had left the country. In some cases, too, the\r\nstamps which are impressed upon the _hamidiehs_ to show that the vote\r\nhas been registered had been erased, thus enabling an _hamidieh_ to be\r\nused by a succession of would-be voters.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks would now be represented by a powerful party in the Turkish\r\nParliament had not the Committee of Union and Progress kept a close\r\nwatch on them during the elections. The Greeks have themselves to blame\r\nfor the under-representation of which they now complain. They compelled\r\nthe Committee to exercise an influence in the elections which, though\r\ntechnically unfair, was fully justified by the circumstances. The\r\nliberty so recently won had to be safeguarded by the return of a solid\r\nmajority of patriotic Turks to the Chamber of Deputies.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, gifted as they are with administrative capacity, held\r\nhigh appointments under the old _régime_, and will no doubt do so to\r\na greater extent under a constitutional Government; but as a people\r\nthey have yet to prove themselves loyal Ottomans. During the elections\r\ntheir one thought was for the interests of their own race. Headed by\r\nthe [OE]cumenical Patriarch, they demanded the maintenance of all the\r\nprivileges that had been granted to them from the time of the Turkish\r\nconquest. The Moslems have had to give up their special rights, but the\r\nGreeks refused to surrender a single one of their privileges for the\r\nsake of Ottoman unity. The Greeks chatter about liberty, equality, and\r\nfraternity, but their aim is to secure to themselves advantages over\r\nthe other Christian peoples; and the Patriarchate, the most cruel and\r\nintolerant ecclesiastical tyranny remaining in the world, makes use\r\nof “liberty” to increase its persecutions of the exarchists and other\r\nschismatics. In the ranks of the reactionaries are to be found many\r\nGreeks who profited much by the Despotism whose parasites they were. A\r\nlarge number of the Greeks in Turkey still cling to their separatist\r\naspirations. Even as I write this the Greeks in Macedonia are breaking\r\nthe peace which the Young Turks brought to that long harassed land;\r\nfor large Greek bands are once more in the field, with no shadow of a\r\ngrievance as their excuse for brigandage this time, but agitating for\r\nvarious things, including the annexation of Crete to Greece. If the\r\ngreat Powers would act together and let it be clearly understood that\r\nunder no conceivable circumstances will Greece be permitted to annex\r\nanother foot of Ottoman territory, the Greeks in Turkey might become\r\nthe useful citizens of a united country; for they, like all the other\r\npeoples in European Turkey, would prefer even a Hamidian despotism to\r\nthe domination of Germany, Austria, or Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n_THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 17 Abdul Hamid drove through the streets of his capital\r\nbetween cheering crowds to open the Turkish Parliament. The scene\r\nhas been often described, and it is unnecessary here to relate again\r\nthe events of that memorable day. That night I sailed through the\r\nDardanelles, and on either side of me, on the shores of both Europe and\r\nAsia, every little town and village and the anchored fleets of fishing\r\ncraft in the harbours were brightly illuminated; isolated farm-houses\r\non snowy hillsides had their windows full of lights; fires blazed on\r\nmany a lonely peak; and so it was all along the shores of Turkey from\r\nthe Adriatic and the Ægean to the Black Sea and the shores of the\r\nPersian Gulf. It was a day and a night of rejoicing, and so contagious\r\nwas the sincere enthusiasm that even the most cynical foreigner in the\r\nland had not the heart to speak otherwise than hopefully of the future\r\nof this freed country.\r\n\r\nSome months have passed since that winter’s day. As might have been\r\nexpected, things have not gone altogether smoothly in Turkey, and\r\nthere have been reports of internal dissensions that have puzzled and\r\nalarmed the English well-wishers of the new _régime_. As regards the\r\nopen rebellions against the Government that have occurred in various\r\nportions of the Empire, no one imagined that the proclamation of a\r\nConstitution would suddenly bring peace, once and for all, to restless\r\nraces that have been fighting and raiding for centuries. The complete\r\npacification of these regions cannot but be a work of time. The lawless\r\nAlbanian tribes are again carrying on their organised brigandage, even\r\nin that Dibra district where Niazi Bey’s propaganda had been so wholly\r\nsuccessful; the Northern Albanians are agitating for autonomy, even as\r\nthey were thirty years ago when I wandered through their highlands;\r\nTurkish troops, even as I am writing this, are defending Armenians\r\nagainst raiding Kurds;[1] risings of fanatical Arabs in Arabia\r\nare being suppressed; and the Greek bands are once more troubling\r\nMacedonia. These are unfortunate happenings, but with a Government\r\nthat combines firmness with justice and patience, this lawless state\r\nof things will disappear; and it must be remembered that sheer love of\r\nfighting and raiding rather than political disaffection is the cause of\r\nsome of these disturbances. These revolts and raids had become almost\r\nchronic complaints under the old _régime_; the world is now watching\r\nTurkey; events that would have passed almost unnoticed a year ago are\r\nreported in the European press, and their importance is naturally\r\noverrated by those who read of them.\r\n\r\n[1] This was written before the counter-revolution and the\r\nterrible massacre of Armenians that followed it.\r\n\r\nBut the political dissensions among the Turks themselves—which have\r\nbeen much embittered of late—are more alarming to the friends of\r\nTurkey than are any of these risings of lawless peoples. This is no\r\ntime for the patriotic element to be divided against itself, and it\r\nbehooves the Young Turks to present a solid and united front to the\r\nmany external and internal enemies of Turkey’s liberty and the Empire’s\r\nintegrity. The Committee of Union and Progress, the deliverer of Turkey\r\nfrom the Despotism, has enemies in the land who are unsparing and\r\nunscrupulous in their attacks, and most cunning in their intriguings.\r\nThe anomalous position of the organisation has naturally invited some\r\nhonest criticism. Almost immediately after the proclamation of the\r\nConstitution, not only reactionary Turks and politicians jealous of\r\nthe Young Turk party, but also European friends of Turkey, including\r\ncertain British diplomatists and a section of the Press that voices\r\ntheir views, began to urge that the Committee, its work having been\r\naccomplished, no longer had a _raison d’être_ and should be dissolved\r\nat once. It was pointed out that an irresponsible power behind the\r\nParliament was unconstitutional, and that the Committee, with its\r\nunknown leaders, had become an illegal institution now that Turkey had\r\nbeen granted representative government.\r\n\r\nNow surely this argument savours of a legal pedantry that ignores\r\nsurrounding conditions. The Committee was, of course, an illegal\r\ninstitution from its inception; it saved Turkey by illegal methods;\r\na revolution cannot but be an illegal operation: and it would be\r\nobviously unsafe on the morrow of a successful revolution—when a\r\nnation is still in confusion, when the people have yet no idea how\r\nthey should exercise their new rights, when the new institutions from\r\ntheir very freedom lie open to the attack of cunning foes—to adhere\r\nstrictly to constitutional technicalities and legalities, and to break\r\nup the strong organised power that has brought about the overthrow of\r\na _régime_. After the English revolution Cromwell had no scruples in\r\nviolating law to save a cause. If there had been a strong Committee\r\nof Union and Progress behind the Constitution which the Sultan swore\r\nto observe on his coming to the throne, Turkey might have been saved\r\nthirty years of despotism and the loss of much territory.\r\n\r\nThe Young Turks fully realised the difficulties and dangers before\r\nthem. Many were the foes of the newly freed fatherland. There were\r\nthose of the Great Powers to whom constitutional liberty in Turkey\r\nmeant interference with their designs to enrich themselves and obtain\r\nterritorial expansion at Turkey’s expense; there were the smaller\r\nPowers on the frontier, Bulgaria, Servia, Greece, eager to scramble\r\nover the partition of Macedonia; and, far more dangerous than these,\r\nthere were the Turkish reactionaries, who began to intrigue everywhere\r\nagainst the Constitution immediately after its proclamation, ready\r\nto seize their chance when they saw it. The Young Turks in their\r\nhour of triumph had freely pardoned all save a few of the worst of\r\nthe creatures of the Palace, but this great clemency gained them no\r\ngratitude. It was also a source of no small danger that the Young\r\nTurks, having but few trained administrators in their own ranks, had\r\nretained the services of such high officials of the old _régime_ as had\r\nno notoriously evil records for corruption or oppression. Some of these\r\nmen are the secret enemies of the new order of things. The Young Turks,\r\ntherefore, determined to remain on their guard and see to it that\r\nTurkey’s newly won liberty was not wrested from her. As I have stated\r\nin a previous chapter, they held that, far from losing its _raison\r\nd’être_ on the opening of Parliament, the Committee of Union and\r\nProgress would be more necessary than ever for the protection of the\r\ncountry, and they decided not to dissolve this powerful organisation,\r\nbut to maintain it, legally or illegally, supported as heretofore\r\nby the army, until such time as the Constitution should be firmly\r\nestablished. Such was their justification, and they were sincere in\r\ntheir explanations of their resolution.\r\n\r\nAs will have been gathered from what I have said in this book the\r\nCommittee of Union and Progress is no small body of patriots. When I\r\nwas in Turkey it numbered seventy thousand members. I understand that\r\nit now has a membership of about a hundred thousand. It includes all\r\nthat is best and most patriotic of the educated young Moslem manhood of\r\nthe country. There are now the many Christians, too, on the Committee\r\nwho have rejected the idle separatist aspirations of their several\r\nraces and have Ottoman unity as their ideal, and also many of those\r\nJews who from the beginning have co-operated loyally with the Young\r\nTurks. When I was in the country last autumn it looked much as if this\r\nCommittee had as its members nearly all the men to whom it would be\r\nsafest to leave the guidance of the Empire.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it seems to be an undoubted fact that the Committee of\r\nUnion and Progress has made many enemies even among those who cannot\r\nbe accused of reactionary tendencies. The Committee has undoubtedly\r\ndone some ill-advised and tactless things, and its arbitrary methods\r\nhave raised up against itself some relentless foes; but there can, I\r\nthink, be no doubt that it has been actuated throughout by pure and\r\npatriotic motives, and that its errors have been those of zeal and\r\ninexperience. I have met several members of the party recently, and\r\nthey all sincerely believe that the Committee had very good reasons\r\nfor compelling Kiamil Pasha to resign the Grand Vizierate in February\r\nlast; they are confident that the aged statesman had been misled by\r\nthe plausible enemies of Turkey’s liberties and was being duped by\r\nreactionaries. The friction between the Committee and the Grand Vizier\r\ncommenced some months before the opening of the Parliament; Kiamil,\r\nbeing a Pasha of the old school, naturally resented the dictation of\r\nthe Committee, and complained that while his was the responsibility\r\nthe Committee held all the power. The Committee was alarmed by\r\nKiamil Pasha’s friendly relations with the Liberal Union, the party\r\nin opposition to the Committee, and recognised the insidious work of\r\nreactionary influence when Kiamil despatched from Constantinople to\r\nMacedonia certain battalions that were faithful to the Committee,\r\nthus imperilling, in the eyes of the Young Turks, the safety of the\r\nconstitutional cause in the capital. When the Grand Vizier, without\r\nconsultation with his ministers or with the party, suddenly dismissed\r\nthe Ministers of War and Marine, the nominees of the Committee, and\r\nplaced others in their stead, the crisis was precipitated. The Young\r\nTurks, above all things, were determined that those in whom they did\r\nnot place implicit confidence should not control the army, so the\r\nCommittee, even as it had compelled the resignation of Said Pasha,\r\nbecause he had left the appointment of the Ministers of War and Marine\r\nin the hands of the Sultan, now insisted upon the resignation of Kiamil\r\nPasha, and effected its purpose in so peremptory a way that it lost\r\nmuch of its popularity with the people and afforded its unscrupulous\r\nenemies a handle for attack. The intrigues connected with the fall of\r\nKiamil Pasha need not be discussed here; but one gathers that the man\r\nchiefly to blame is Kiamil’s own son, Said, a worthless person who\r\nenriched himself by co-operating with the brigands in the neighbourhood\r\nof Smyrna. On several previous occasions he has compromised by his\r\nintrigues his aged father, the one person in Turkey who believes that\r\nthere is no real harm in this very bad specimen of a young Turkish\r\ngentleman. Of Kiamil Pasha’s successor to the Grand Vizierate, Hilmi\r\nPasha, I have already spoken.\r\n\r\nThe Committee justified its treatment of Kiamil Pasha and its other\r\narbitrary acts by pleading the necessity of protecting the nation\r\nagainst the strong reactionary forces which certainly do exist, despite\r\nthe assertions of the organs of the Liberal Union, which have ever\r\nridiculed the possibility of a reactionary movement, and have accused\r\nthe Committee of having invented this bogey as an excuse for its own\r\ndespotic methods. Kiamil Pasha had ever been the friend of the English,\r\nand his removal from the Grand Vizierate produced—to the great regret\r\nof the Young Turks—a somewhat bad impression in England, the country\r\nabove all others whose friendship is valued by patriotic Turks. Those\r\nwho had held that the Committee was an illegal institution and ought\r\nto be dissolved became alienated for a while from the men who had been\r\nthe saviours of Turkey; and it is a great pity that this was so, for\r\nat that critical time the Young Turks, who never before had trod the\r\ntortuous ways of politics, and were apt to fall into the traps that\r\nwere cunningly laid for them, were much in need of the sympathetic help\r\nand advice from those whose experience and knowledge qualified them to\r\noffer these. The result is, I think, that the Young Turk side of the\r\nquestion has not been understood in England.\r\n\r\nThe Young Turk party, as represented by the Committee of Union and\r\nProgress, is now but one of several parties in Turkey professing\r\nLiberal principles. In Parliament the Committee’s nominees form the\r\nlarge majority; but the rival parties, though they may be numerically\r\nsmall and were regarded as insignificant when I was in the country,\r\nhave displayed great energy in winning supporters outside the Chamber,\r\nand are no longer a negligible quantity. Though diametrically\r\nopposed to each other in their principles, they appear to be united\r\nin their hatred and jealousy of the Young Turk party, without whose\r\nself-sacrificing struggle for freedom they would never have had an\r\nopportunity of existing at all. The Young Turks, as I have explained,\r\ndesired Ottoman unity, perhaps an impossible but certainly a noble\r\nideal, and it was a disappointment to them that, so soon as Parliament\r\nmet, the Deputies who were not partisans of the Committee divided\r\nthemselves into distinct nationalist groups, some of them impracticably\r\nsocialistic in their aims, others separatist at heart.\r\n\r\nBy far the most powerful of these groups, a composite party, composed\r\nof Moslems, Christians, and others, calls itself the Liberal Union.\r\nWhereas the Young Turks, while advocating equality without distinction\r\nof race or creed, insists that the supremacy of the Mussulman Turks\r\nshould be safeguarded, desires to bring about a fusion of the different\r\nelements, and wants no greater administrative decentralisation than is\r\nnecessary; the Liberal Union, on the other hand, is opposed to what it\r\nterms Turkish Chauvinism, and asks for a degree of decentralisation\r\nwhich the Young Turks regard as dangerous to the integrity of the\r\nEmpire. The Liberal Union therefore stands for home rule. It is largely\r\nsupported by the Greek element, and this fact does not commend it to\r\nthose who desire Ottoman unity. It is understood that the party has\r\nbeen well supplied with funds by the Greek merchants in Turkey, who are\r\never generous in their subscriptions to a Greek national cause; but\r\none cannot feel that the integrity of the Ottoman Empire is safe in\r\ntheir hands. A source of weakness to the Committee are its self-denying\r\nprinciples, whereby there are to be no known leaders, no gratification\r\nof personal ambition by its members, and no seeking for the plums of\r\noffice. The Liberal Union has no such principles of self-abnegation,\r\nand it has for its leader the Albanian Ismail Kemal Bey, a victim of\r\nthe Despotism and for some time an exile, a man of marked ability and\r\nof great ambition. He left the Young Turk party on the grounds that\r\nits principles were not sufficiently Liberal, and formed this party\r\nof his own, which is the bitterest and most unscrupulous enemy of the\r\nCommittee of Union and Progress.\r\n\r\nThe organs of the Liberal Union have been carrying on a press campaign\r\nagainst the Committee of Union and Progress. Among other things they\r\nhave asserted that the best men have deserted the Committee, that\r\nthe heroes of the revolution, such as Niazi Bey and Enver Bey, have\r\nleft it in disgust, that reactionaries and self-seeking adventurers\r\nhave worked their way into the Committee’s centre and are directing\r\nits policy. It is, of course, possible, and even probable, that some\r\nunworthy men have been admitted into the Committee, but I am certain\r\nthat they have exercised no influence, and I am of opinion that\r\nthey would not have been allowed to remain in it after their true\r\ncharacters had been discovered. When I was in Turkey last autumn it\r\nwas not altogether an easy matter to become a member of the Committee.\r\nOn more than one occasion when I have asked a member whether some\r\nmutual friend was in the Committee, he has replied in the negative,\r\nexplaining that the person in question had expressed his wish to join\r\nthe Committee, and that he seemed a fitting person, but that the\r\nCommittee would not elect him until more was known concerning him. As\r\nto the allegations made by the organs of the Liberal Union, many of the\r\nmost active members of the Committee, men obviously actuated by the\r\nsincerest patriotism, are my friends, and I know that not one of them\r\nhas left the Committee or has lost faith in it. I also know that the\r\nsingle-minded patriots who made the revolution are still members of the\r\nCommittee. Both Niazi Bey and Enver Bey have flatly contradicted the\r\nstatements that were made concerning them.\r\n\r\nThe Young Turks who write to me from their own country or who converse\r\nwith me in London are unanimous in describing the situation as serious,\r\nbut in their opinion the Committee is too strong for its enemies. They\r\nsay that the Sultan himself is on the side of the Committee, and\r\ndisapproves of the machinations of the Liberal Union. They maintain\r\nthat whatever professions of Liberalism the Liberal Union may make\r\nit is reactionary in its policy, has known reactionaries within its\r\nranks, and is led by self-seeking politicians lacking in patriotism.\r\nThey allege that many of the Greeks who support the Liberal Union,\r\nhaving thrived as parasites of the old _régime_, prefer despotisms to\r\nconstitutions. They, moreover, explain that some members of the Liberal\r\nUnion are exceedingly clever and cunning men who have succeeded in\r\nwinning over honest men of the Young Turk party—including _ulemas_ and\r\nother strict adherents of the Mussulman creed—by specious arguments and\r\nmisrepresentations. All this seems probable, and it is certain that\r\nnumbers of the Young Turks, though true patriots, are simple-minded\r\nhonest men who are likely to be duped by the trained intriguers among\r\nthe Committee’s enemies.\r\n\r\nOne gathers, therefore, that an incongruous alliance of non-Moslem\r\nsocialists, Greek separatists, reactionaries, and misled upright\r\nMussulmans is opposed to the Committee of Union and Progress. A most\r\nmalignant press campaign is being carried on against the Committee, and\r\nthe organs of the Committee strike hard in return, with the unfortunate\r\nresult that on either side an intense hatred has been engendered which\r\ncannot but be injurious to the country’s interests, imperils the\r\nConstitution, and plays into the hands of Turkey’s external foes.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Union and Progress is not rich and has not attempted\r\nto enrich itself; but it appears that the Liberal Union is well\r\nsupplied with funds wherewith to carry on its campaign, purchase\r\nnewspapers, and buy the consciences of men. It is known that the Greeks\r\nhave been the largest contributors to these funds. The Palace gang is\r\nalso said to have supplied its share. When I was in Constantinople I\r\nwas informed that the Committee had intercepted correspondence between\r\nthe Palace and a certain Pasha—who was then an exile in England passing\r\nunder various aliases—and had obtained proof that this notorious\r\nperson was the trustee of large sums lying in London banks which\r\nwere intended to meet the expenses of intriguing for the restoration\r\nof the old _régime_. Certain foreign Powers, which have no love for\r\nthe Young Turk _régime_, have also been openly accused of intriguing\r\nwith the reactionaries. If they are innocent of this they have but\r\nthemselves to blame for the suspicion that attaches to them, for one\r\ncan only judge of their present policy by regarding their past. How\r\nunscrupulously Germany exploited the old _régime_ is known to all the\r\nworld. Some of the Germans whom I met in Constantinople expressed\r\ntheir conviction and their hope that the days of the new _régime_\r\nwere numbered. It was interesting to hear these men, who represented\r\nthe political commercialism of their country, frankly state, as if it\r\nwere an incontrovertible axiom, that all European peoples, whether\r\nGerman, British, or any other, had for their one aim in Turkey the\r\nexploitation of a helpless country. The Germans are perfectly sincere\r\nwhen they assert that the Balkan Committee is the paid agent of a\r\ncunning British Government, that the expression of British sympathy\r\nfor oppressed nationalities is organised hypocrisy with the attainment\r\nof selfish ends as its one motive. As they look with their cold, blue\r\neyes into yours you realise that they quite believe these things.\r\nThe materialism of modern Germany has so sunk into the souls of her\r\nsons—including some of the most illustrious of them—that it has become\r\ninconceivable to them that a nation, or a group of the citizens of\r\nthat nation, can take a disinterested interest in the affairs of\r\nother nations and sympathise unselfishly with its misfortunes or\r\ntriumphs. To the Germans the enthusiasm with which the success of the\r\nYoung Turk cause was welcomed in England was all humbug—a cleverly\r\nengineered manifestation of friendship whose object it was to secure\r\nfor Great Britain the influence in Turkey which Germany had lost by the\r\nrevolution but confidently looked forward to recovering at an early\r\ndate by more straightforward if more brutal methods.\r\n\r\nThe thirty years of despotism, by its deliberate encouragement of\r\ncorruption, had demoralised a great part of the Turkish nation. The\r\ncure cannot come in a day, and those well provided with money can still\r\nbuy power in Constantinople. It was amid very corrupt surroundings\r\nthat the Young Turks, pure themselves, set to work to undertake the\r\nregeneration of Turkey and to make the Empire strong. To begin with,\r\nConstantinople is full of men who have lived by corrupt practices\r\nall their lives—the men who were blackmailing spies under the old\r\n_régime_, or had belonged to that huge tribe of useless functionaries\r\nwho used to crowd every public department and had to be bribed by\r\nthose whom business brought into contact with them. All these people,\r\ntheir occupation now gone, are wandering about the capital in very\r\ndisconsolate mood, hard up, regretting “the good old days,” and hating\r\nthe purifying influence that has brought this change about. These men\r\nare all reactionaries; many of them know well how to poison the minds\r\nof ignorant people against the Committee with cunning inventions.\r\nThey are largely responsible for the growing popular dislike of the\r\nCommittee. It is very difficult for the people in the capital to arrive\r\nat the truth, and they are largely at the mercy of paid agitators\r\nand schemers. Even foreign Governments are able to influence public\r\nopinion in Turkey. The Germans and Austrians possess a useful piece of\r\nmachinery for the dissemination of news to serve their own interests in\r\nthe shape of a telegraphic agency which supplies Constantinople with\r\npractically all its foreign information, and sells its despatches by\r\nthe column to the newspapers of that city at a low rate that cannot\r\npossibly pay the expenses of the service. The news which purports to\r\ncome from London is often of an astonishing character.\r\n\r\nI understand that the Committee of Union and Progress is now about to\r\nreorganise its constitution and convert itself into what we should\r\ncall a Parliamentary party; but under whatever name it continues its\r\nexistence it is to be hoped that this body of men, which has done\r\nsuch great and noble work for Turkey, which contains so many men of\r\nsingle-minded, self-sacrificing patriotism, will remain the dominating\r\nparty in the country. But it will have to be as the strong man armed\r\nand ever watchful, for its enemies are many and have the money\r\nwherewith, alas! the consciences of both men and newspapers can still\r\nbe purchased in Turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n_THE NEW SULTAN_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greater part of this book was in the press, and the preceding\r\nchapter, which was to have been the final one, lacked but a few\r\nconcluding paragraphs to bring my work to a close, when the news\r\nreached London that a revolution had broken out in Constantinople. On\r\nthat eventful thirteenth of April I was lunching in a literary club off\r\nthe Strand with two well-known members of the Young Turk party. The\r\ninformation conveyed by an early issue of a so-called evening paper\r\nwas scanty, and we hoped that nothing worse had occurred than one of\r\nthose mutinous demonstrations on the part of the Sultan’s pampered\r\nBody-guard which the Young Turks have already proved themselves capable\r\nof suppressing with promptitude and vigour. But later and fuller\r\ninformation brought anger and sorrow to the friends of Turkey: nearly\r\nthe whole garrison of the capital had risen against the Government; the\r\nsoldiers were killing their young officers; fanatical mobs were hunting\r\nout the members of the Young Turk party to murder them; the Committee\r\nof Union and Progress, in Constantinople at any rate, was at the feet\r\nof its enemies.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Committee were fleeing for their lives from their\r\nfellow-countrymen, whom they had saved from a hated despotism. A\r\nfew months ago I heard these same Constantinople mobs shouting\r\nthemselves hoarse with cries of “Long live the Committee of Union and\r\nProgress!” and all seemed grateful to this band of men who, animated by\r\nsingle-minded patriotism and a spirit of self-sacrifice, had organised\r\nthe revolution. But a large portion of the population of Constantinople\r\nis a very vile thing; it is made up of everything that is worst of the\r\nvarious races of the Levant and of regions farther east. The fanatical\r\nKurds are ever ready to join in any rising that gives them the\r\nopportunity of pillage and murder; the greater part of the Christian\r\npopulation is too cowardly to defend itself; here, too, are collected\r\nall the ex-spies and other corrupt products of the old _régime_. One\r\nis inclined to think that one of the chief lessons to be learnt by the\r\nYoung Turks from the counter-revolution is that the seat of Government\r\nmight with advantage be removed from Constantinople to some place at a\r\nconsiderable distance from it. My Turkish friends, I may state here,\r\nwere perfectly confident, through those mid-April days when Turkey’s\r\nfuture seemed so dark, that the triumph of the reactionaries would be\r\nbut short-lived, that right would prevail, and that within a few days\r\nthe provinces, strongly supporting the Young Turk cause, would compel\r\nthe capital to submit to their will.\r\n\r\nI have postponed the writing of this final chapter until the last\r\npossible moment, in order that I might obtain a perspective view of\r\nthese strange happenings in the Turkish capital. As may be gathered\r\nfrom the preceding chapter, there was a good deal of uneasiness in\r\nConstantinople for some time before the outbreak of the 13th. The\r\nbitter strife between the Committee of Union and Progress and the\r\nLiberal Union weakened the constitutional cause. A newly formed society\r\ncalled the Jemiyet-Mohammedieh (the League of Mohammed) was obtaining\r\na hold upon the Moslem population. It professed to be in favour of the\r\nConstitution, but called for a strict application of the Sheriat or\r\nSacred Law. It was the enemy of the Committee of Union and Progress,\r\nmaintaining that the members of the Committee, including the young\r\narmy officers, did not observe the precepts of the Koran, and by\r\ntheir irreligious ways set a bad example to the rank and file. These\r\nmovements afforded an opportunity for mischief to the reactionaries,\r\nthe men who cared little for religion or country, but desired the\r\nreturn of the absolutism with the corruption on which they had lived.\r\nSo men from the Palace, together with ex-spies and dishonest Government\r\n_employés_ who had been deprived of their posts by the new _régime_,\r\nbegan to intrigue with success, and were much helped by the fact that\r\nmany of their own base order had wormed themselves both into the\r\nLiberal Union and the Mohammedan League.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal Union apparently took the lead in the plot against the\r\nGovernment, and it became obvious that it was well provided with\r\nfunds. I am told that for a considerable time before the outbreak the\r\nmembers of this association used to frequent the principal hotel in\r\nPera, and made of it a sort of head-quarters. Here, spending plenty of\r\nmoney, they used to converse plausibly with foreign visitors, including\r\nthe correspondents of newspapers; for it was part of their aim to gain\r\nforeign sympathy—and especially English sympathy—for their cause;\r\ntheir efforts were attended with some success, for while plotting with\r\nreaction they prated of liberty, and their arguments to the effect\r\nthat in the Committee of Union and Progress Turkey had but found a new\r\ndespotism in place of the old one were convincing to many.\r\n\r\nThe acrimony of the strife between the two parties was much intensified\r\nby the assassination of the editor of a Liberal newspaper, presumably\r\nby some one in sympathy with the Committee; and as it became clear\r\nthat the loyalty of the First Army Corps, forming the garrison of\r\nConstantinople, was being undermined by the agents of reaction,\r\nGeneral Mukhtar Pasha, who was in command of that army corps, began\r\nto take due precautions; on April 12 he issued most stringent orders\r\nto his men, explaining to them that they were to shoot down even\r\n_softas_ and other civilians if ordered to do so by their officers.\r\nI have already explained that the fidelity to the Constitution of\r\nthis army corps, which included the pampered Palace Guards, had been\r\ndoubtful from the beginning. The Young Turks, after the mutiny in\r\nNovember, had removed some of the least reliable battalions and had\r\nreplaced them with troops from Salonica. They had intended greatly to\r\nreduce the Imperial Guard itself, but had refrained from doing so at\r\nthe earnest wish of the Sultan. I have pointed out that before the\r\nrevolution these Palace troops were officered with men risen from their\r\nown ranks—_alaili_—ignorant and faithful men who could be relied on\r\nto support their benevolent master, the Sultan. The Young Turks had\r\nremoved these rankers, replacing them with _mekteblis_, officers who\r\nhave passed through the military schools, and therefore to a man are\r\nsupporters of the Young Turk party, many of them being members of the\r\nCommittee. There is no doubt that the rank and file bitterly resented\r\nthis innovation, and there grew up a sullen discontent, which subtle\r\nagitators who appealed to Mussulman fanaticism could easily fan into\r\na flame. The _hodjas_ and _softas_ were assiduously preaching in the\r\nbarracks that the Committee was endangering the Moslem faith, and the\r\nminds of the men became poisoned against their officers.\r\n\r\nBut though there was uneasiness in the capital, the counter-revolution\r\ncame to the citizens as a complete surprise. In the afternoon of the\r\n12th a British officer, who had just arrived in the capital, visited\r\nthe various barracks, and found the troops peacefully drilling or\r\nperforming their other ordinary duties, the officers and men alike\r\nseeming happy and contented, and an Inspector of Police of great\r\nexperience informed him that the city had never been more quiet and\r\norderly. During the early hours of the 13th, while it was still\r\ndark, people were awakened by the tramp of soldiery in the streets\r\n(successive bodies of men marching in silence), wondered a little what\r\nthese unwonted movements signified, and then went to sleep again. When\r\nthey went out a few hours later the citizens found the whole city at\r\nthe mercy of nearly twenty thousand mutinous troops. The plot had\r\nbeen carefully organised with the same extraordinary secrecy that had\r\ncharacterised the Young Turk revolution of the previous July, and no\r\none save those concerned had any suspicion as to what was about to\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\nBefore dawn the troops, after shooting some of their officers and\r\nbinding and imprisoning others, marched through the streets under the\r\ncommand of their non-commissioned officers, and concentrated in the\r\nneighbourhood of the House of Parliament. The Salonica Chasseurs, who,\r\nas Macedonian troops, had been regarded as being wholly loyal to the\r\nYoung Turk cause, took a leading part in the revolt. A large number of\r\nmarines also joined the mutineers and were guilty of the murder of many\r\nofficers. When the sun rose the square outside the Parliament House\r\nand the Mosque of St. Sophia was packed with the mutineers and a great\r\nnumber of _softas_ and _hodjas_ in their turbans and flowing robes,\r\nwho harangued the soldiers and inflamed their fanatical zeal. In front\r\nof St. Sophia waved the red and green banner of the Sheriat. Brave\r\nofficers who occasionally arrived to remonstrate with their men were\r\nimmediately killed.\r\n\r\nIt was apparent that the revolt had been very carefully planned, and\r\nthat the troops had received detailed instructions which they obeyed\r\nto the letter, and there can be no doubt that they were assured that\r\nthey were doing as the Padishah wished them to do. Bodies of troops\r\nwere detached to seize the bridges and the telegraph offices, and\r\ndispositions were made to meet resistance from any point. It was\r\nmade quite clear that the main object of the counter-revolution was\r\nthe destruction of the Committee of Union and Progress; for, while\r\nkilling officers and others who belonged to that association, the\r\nsoldiers preserved order, in no way interfered with the civilian\r\npopulation, and spoke reassuring words to the Christians whom they\r\nmet. But notwithstanding this, there was, of course, a panic in the\r\ncity, and all the shops put up their shutters. Mobs of Mussulmans of\r\nthe dangerous class, Kurds and Lazes, armed with pistols and clubs,\r\nand in many cases with rifles, joined the soldiery; but even these had\r\napparently been given the word that excesses would damage the cause\r\nof the faithful, for the massacres and pillage which might have been\r\nexpected from this rough and fanatical element of the population did\r\nnot occur.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators had not secured the support of the entire garrison of\r\nConstantinople; for troops loyal to the Government—cavalry, artillery,\r\nand infantry—were holding the Ministry of War on the morning of the\r\n13th. General Mukhtar Pasha, the commander of the First Army Corps,\r\nwas on duty on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, and he has told\r\nan interviewer that the signal for revolution had been purposely\r\ngiven while he was absent. So soon as he was informed as to what was\r\nhappening he hurried back to Stamboul, and on reaching head-quarters\r\non the morning of the 13th found the Ministry of War surrounded by a\r\nwildly excited mob. He collected the troops who had not joined the\r\nmutineers and dispersed the crowd with his cavalry. He states that had\r\nhe been given full powers he could have nipped the revolt in the bud,\r\nand that had the Ministry taken the proper measures in time the mutiny\r\ncould have been mastered without bloodshed. But Mukhtar was expressly\r\nimpeded from taking energetic action and, as the natural result, his\r\nown troops began to desert him. When Mukhtar heard that the Sultan had\r\nissued an amnesty to the mutineers he realised that he could do no\r\nmore, and resigned his command. He only escaped the death that had been\r\nprepared for him by taking a circuitous route, and ultimately found a\r\nrefuge on a foreign man-of-war.\r\n\r\nThe demands that were made by the mutineers showed pretty conclusively\r\nthat the plot had been arranged by the Liberal Union working hand in\r\nhand with reactionaries and fanatics. The troops cheered loudly for\r\nthe Sultan, called for the strict application of the Sacred Law, the\r\noverthrow of the Government, the destruction of the Committee, and\r\nthe removal of the officers of the Salonica Chasseurs and the marines.\r\nThe following specific demands, which could never have been thought\r\nout by the ignorant soldiers, who know nothing of politics, were also\r\nput forward by them—demands which had obviously been prompted by the\r\nLiberal Union—the dismissal of the Grand Vizier, the Ministers of War\r\nand Marine, the commander of the First Army Corps, and the President\r\nof the Chamber of Deputies; the removal from Constantinople of the\r\neditor of the Young Turk newspaper, the _Tannin_, and the expulsion of\r\nRahmi Bey and Djavid Bey, Deputies for Salonica, and members of the\r\nCommittee of Union and Progress. The soldiers also asked that Ismail\r\nKemal Bey, the leader of the Liberal Union, and his supporter, Zohrab\r\nBey, should be made President and Vice-President of the Chamber of\r\nDeputies. Their acts as well as their words proved who had instigated\r\nthem to revolt; they murdered Nazim Pasha, the Minister of Justice, and\r\nwounded the Minister of Marine; they killed the Emir Mohammed Arslan,\r\na highly respected Deputy, as he was entering the House, mistaking him\r\nfor the editor of the _Tannin_, and they destroyed the offices of the\r\nCommittee of Union and Progress, as well as those of its organs, the\r\n_Shura-i-Ummet_ and the _Tannin_.\r\n\r\nDuring April 13 the reactionaries ruled Constantinople; the members\r\nof the Committee of Union and Progress had to take to flight or hide\r\nthemselves, and several of the Generals crossed the Bosphorus and\r\ntook refuge in the house of a well-known British merchant. The Liberal\r\nUnion, which had let loose the forces of disorder, enjoyed but a short\r\ntriumph. In the evening of the 13th some Deputies met in the House\r\nand elected the Liberal Union leader, Ismail Kemal Bey, as President\r\nof the Chamber—an illegal proceeding, as there was no quorum, and the\r\nYoung Turk members who represented the parliamentary majority naturally\r\nwere not present. In the course of the day Ismail Kemal and some\r\nmembers of the Liberal Union went to the Yildiz and begged the Sultan\r\nto appoint Kiamil Pasha, who was a supporter of the Union, as Grand\r\nVizier, but the Sultan refused to listen to their advice. From this\r\ntime the Liberal Union lost its hold on the people, and was deserted\r\nby many members of the party who were good patriots and adherents\r\nof the Constitution, for these recognised and were horrified at the\r\nmischief that had been wrought by the self-seeking wire-pullers of this\r\nso-called “Liberal” organisation.\r\n\r\nAnd in the meanwhile all eyes were turned anxiously to the Yildiz to\r\ndiscover what would be the attitude of the inscrutable monarch at this\r\ncrisis. In the evening of the 13th, when the Sultan granted an amnesty\r\nto the mutineers, called them his children, and yielded to many of\r\ntheir demands, there were lovers of liberty who feared the worst; but\r\nwhen it became known that the Sultan had not taken immediate advantage\r\nof the situation to restore absolutism, but, on the contrary, on\r\nthe resignation of the Young Turk Ministry in the afternoon, had\r\nappointed Tewfik Pasha as Grand Vizier and Edhem Pasha as Minister of\r\nWar, great relief was felt; for these were two trusted and able men,\r\nwho, though they were no partisans of this or that political group,\r\nwere undoubtedly men of Liberal principles and no creatures of the\r\nDespotism. So the Constitutionalists took heart, and they were still\r\nmore reassured when on the 15th Nazim Pasha was appointed Commander of\r\nthe First Army Corps and Assistant Minister of War. The appointment\r\nof Nazim Pasha as Minister of War in February last had roused the\r\nopposition of the Committee of Union and Progress, and was one of the\r\nchief causes of the fall of Kiamil Pasha; but, as the Young Turks\r\nclearly explained at the time, it was with Kiamil’s policy that they\r\nfound fault; Nazim himself was admired and respected by them as a fine\r\nsoldier and a man of distinctly Liberal views, for which the Palace had\r\nmade him suffer in his time. It was therefore recognised that the newly\r\ncreated temporary Government was at any rate not a reactionary one, and\r\nthat the cause of liberty, though still in great peril, was not yet\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nFor twenty-four hours the soldiers celebrated their victory by firing\r\noff their rifles in the streets, thereby accidentally killing and\r\nwounding a good many people. It was noticed that they had plenty of\r\nmoney to spend, and it was evident that a large sum had been provided\r\nby the organisers of the conspiracy to buy the support of the army.\r\nAs many of the men confessed afterwards, they had succumbed to gifts\r\nof money and had been misled by lying preachers who approached them\r\nin the name of religion. On April 15 Nazim Pasha, who is popular with\r\nthe army, though a strict disciplinarian, announced that the severest\r\npunishment would be inflicted on any soldiers who fired in the streets,\r\nand explained that the Sultan’s amnesty only protected them from\r\npunishment for crimes committed during the two previous days. Next\r\nhe released all officers who had been imprisoned by the mutineers,\r\nand warned the soldiers that no mercy would be shown to those who\r\nmolested these officers or any of the civilian population. The bulk\r\nof the troops now returned to their barracks, order was restored, and\r\noutwardly Constantinople was once again a city of peace.\r\n\r\nBut a crime had been committed with what far-reaching evil results to\r\nTurkey no man knows yet. This wanton conspiracy, doomed to failure\r\nfrom the beginning, not only threatened the destruction of the\r\nConstitution, but, stirring up all the forces of reaction, sent a wave\r\nof fanaticism sweeping through Asia that it will be difficult indeed\r\nto stem. It has brought about the massacre of Christians, civil war,\r\nthe fratricidal fighting between Turkish armies, the menace of foreign\r\nintervention, and the possibility of the disintegration of the Empire\r\nitself. The counter-revolution soon bore its evil fruit. On April 15,\r\ntelegrams from Mersina, in Asia Minor, announced the beginning of\r\nthose massacres which have cost the lives of thousands of Armenians.\r\nIt is probable that the reactionaries planned these massacres, for the\r\nfact that certain notable Armenians were warned as to what was about\r\nto happen by their Moslem friends, disproves the theory that a chance\r\naffray was responsible for all this slaughter; at any rate the outbreak\r\nof murderous fanaticism would have been suppressed speedily had not\r\nthe authority of the Government officials on the spot been destroyed\r\nby the revolt in the capital. Then came the news of a rising of the\r\nMoslem Albanians, whom the agents of reaction had converted into the\r\nbitter enemies of the Young Turks. During these days of doubt and fear\r\nfor patriotic Turks, but one event of hopeful augury occurred. On April\r\n19 the Turko-Bulgarian Protocol, by which Turkey recognised Bulgaria’s\r\nindependence, was signed. The provisional Government had acted wisely,\r\nfor thus was removed the danger of a war with Bulgaria at this very\r\ncritical time.\r\n\r\nA member of the Young Turk party said to me: “If the reactionaries\r\nimagine that we will take this lying down they will find themselves\r\nmuch mistaken. We are very strong: practically all European Turkey is\r\non our side, and you will see that we will now set to work to crush\r\nthe power of the reactionaries once and for all.” And so indeed it has\r\ncome to pass. When the news of the counter-revolution reached Salonica,\r\nthe city that is proud that it was the cradle of Turkey’s liberty, the\r\ninhabitants—Moslems, Christians, and Jews—were infuriated, and called\r\nfor an immediate march upon Constantinople. To Salonica flocked the\r\nofficers and other members of the Committee who had escaped from the\r\ncapital, and thither, too, hurried the two gallant young leaders of\r\nthe July revolution, Enver Bey and Hakki Bey, who at the time were the\r\nTurkish military _attachés_ in Berlin and Vienna respectively. Niazi\r\nBey, too, in Monastir, sent the word to his Albanian and Bulgarian\r\nfriends to collect volunteers, and he himself, with the regulars under\r\nhis command, took train to Salonica. And now it was made manifest that\r\nMacedonia, at any rate, remained faithful to the Constitution and to\r\nthe Young Turk party. The men of the Third Army Corps were eager to be\r\nled against the traitorous reactionaries of the capital; the civilian\r\nMoslems formed themselves into bands of _fedais_; all the Bulgarian\r\nclubs in Macedonia declared themselves the supporters of the Young Turk\r\ncause, and their members expressed their readiness to die in defence\r\nof the Constitution, and this despite the fact that the Bulgarians\r\nhad not been treated fairly during the Parliamentary elections; the\r\nfamous Bulgarian chiefs, Sandansky and Panitza, and other Bulgarian\r\nleaders, brought their bands of enthusiastic mountaineers to Salonica;\r\nthe Albanian Christian mountain tribes, including my old friends the\r\nMiridites, sent their armed men to fight for the cause; the Jews\r\nvolunteered in numbers; indeed, of the various elements composing the\r\npopulation of Macedonia the Greeks alone appear to have held aloof.\r\n\r\nIn Constantinople the reactionaries, notwithstanding the appointment of\r\na Ministry that supported the Constitution, had taken it for granted\r\nthat the success of their cause was assured, and, having seduced the\r\ngarrison to their side, they but awaited the order of the Sultan to\r\ncomplete their work and give the _coup de grace_ to the _régime_ of\r\nliberty. They had apparently omitted to consider whether the rest of\r\nTurkey would support their action; for the news from Macedonia came as\r\na shocking surprise to them, and irritated the well-named _Volkan_, the\r\norgan of the League of Mohammed, into an eruption of furious articles\r\nof a highly inflammatory and dangerous character. First came the news\r\nfrom Salonica that the Committee of Union and Progress refused to\r\nacknowledge the new Government, and that the Macedonians intended to\r\nmarch upon Constantinople. On April 16 a telegram announced that the\r\nfirst sixteen battalions of the Constitutional army (the Third Army\r\nCorps) had already entrained at Salonica. Next it became known that\r\nthe Second Army Corps at Adrianople had agreed to support the Salonica\r\nforce. On the 19th the advanced patrols of the avenging Macedonian army\r\nwere at St. Stefano within two leagues of the capital. It was all in\r\nvain that the Government sent telegrams and deputations to Salonica to\r\nreassure the Young Turks and to explain that the Constitution was in no\r\ndanger, and would be respected by the Sultan and his new Ministry, for\r\nthe Young Turks could not be brought to believe that the Constitution\r\nwas secure while the capital was full of triumphant reactionaries and\r\ntroops who had been bought over to their cause, acting in the name of a\r\nSultan whom it would be folly to trust again.\r\n\r\nSo the Parliamentary troops began to concentrate round the capital,\r\nand the reactionaries lost heart. The Palace spies and other deeply\r\ncompromised persons thought it prudent to flee from the capital. A\r\nfriend of mine, writing from Constantinople, tells me that a panic\r\nseized the people, including many Europeans, and that their hurried\r\ndeparture to catch any steamer in the port, bound for no matter\r\nwhere, was comic, but lacking in dignity. On the other hand, the\r\ndifferent Liberal political groups, Moslem, Christian, and Jew, agreed\r\nto put aside their party differences and to unite in upholding the\r\nConstitution. The Committee of Union and Progress recovered much of the\r\ninfluence and popularity that it had lost, for it was recognised that\r\nthis organisation alone had the power behind it to enforce the will of\r\nthe people and defeat the reactionaries. It became plain, too, that the\r\nMinistry itself was co-operating with the leaders of the Macedonian\r\narmy, so as to come to some arrangement that would safeguard the\r\nConstitution and at the same time prevent, if possible, the shedding\r\nof blood. As for the Sultan, he remained in the Yildiz, inscrutable\r\nas ever, and had frequent conferences with Tewfik Pasha, his Grand\r\nVizier, who announced that “His Sublime Majesty awaits benevolently the\r\narrival of the so-called constitutional army. He has nothing to gain\r\nor fear, since His Sublimity is for the Constitution and is its supreme\r\nguardian.”\r\n\r\nNo preparations for defence or resistance of any sort were made by\r\nthe Government, and Nazim Pasha and the other Generals in the capital\r\nconfined themselves to maintaining order in the garrison and preventing\r\nany fanatical outbreak on the part of the rough element of the\r\nMoslem population. Of the troops forming the garrison a considerable\r\nproportion repented that they had taken part in the mutiny, and,\r\nacknowledging that they had been misled by lies, were ready to take the\r\noath of fidelity to the Constitution; but, on the other hand, a great\r\nmany, including the six thousand who were guarding the Yildiz, were\r\nfaithful to those who had deceived and bribed them, and were prepared\r\nto die for the Sultan.\r\n\r\nGeneral Husni Pasha rapidly brought up the troops that were to\r\ninvest the capital, the bulk of them belonging to the Third Army\r\nCorps; but the force also included contingents from the Second, or\r\nAdrianople, Army Corps and numbers of volunteers, for the most part\r\nMoslem Macedonians, Bulgarians, and Albanians, wild-looking men from\r\nthe mountains clad in their picturesque native dress. General Mahmut\r\nShevket Pasha, the commander of the Third Army Corps, directed the\r\noperations, and on the 21st he left Salonica for the front to take\r\nover the supreme command of the army of investment. Foreign military\r\nobservers have spoken in terms of highest praise of the rapidity with\r\nwhich the Third Army Corps was mobilised, the admirable organisation,\r\nthe discipline, _morale_, and excellent condition of the troops, the\r\narrangements for the supply of food, the completeness of the equipment\r\nof the force, which included field hospitals, field telegraphs, and\r\nother details. The Turkish army has profited much by the splendid\r\ntraining of Baron von der Goltz and the German officers under him, and\r\nhas become a fighting machine which will be able to give a very good\r\naccount of itself if the enemies of Turkey venture to attack her.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to give an account here of the various negotiations\r\nwhich were carried on between the Ministry in Constantinople and the\r\nadvancing army, for it is clear that these were mostly simulated\r\nwith the object of keeping the capital quiet and gaining time until\r\nShevket Pasha had collected a force sufficiently large to overawe\r\nthe reactionary portion of the garrison and so secure the entry and\r\noccupation of Constantinople with as little bloodshed as possible.\r\nOf the many statements made at this time by the Ministry and the\r\nYoung Turk leaders, one stands out as important and significant. The\r\nCommittee of Union and Progress, recognising that this was no time\r\nfor any political party to assert itself, and that all friends of\r\nliberty should unite to save the Constitution, announced its intention\r\nof remaining completely in the background and not intervening in\r\nany way, while the army, acting quite independently, would free the\r\nConstitution from the fetters which traitors had placed upon it. The\r\narmy, it was maintained, had nothing to do with politics or parties. It\r\nwas the army of the nation, and it was for Shevket Pasha, representing\r\nthe army, to redeem its honour by entering the capital, proclaiming\r\nmartial law, and severely punishing the traitors who had corrupted the\r\nsoldiers and used them to forward their reactionary schemes.\r\n\r\nThe army of investment increased in numbers daily, and on April 22\r\na semi-circle of thirty thousand men enclosed Constantinople on its\r\nland side while men-of-war guarded its sea approaches. On that day a\r\nNational Assembly, composed of Senators and Deputies, with Said Pasha\r\nas President, held a secret session at St. Stefano, within the lines\r\nof the investing army, and apparently agreed on the deposition of the\r\nSultan. On Friday, April 23, Abdul Hamid, for the last time, was the\r\ncentral figure of the Selamlik and drove to the mosque between faithful\r\nGuards and a crowd of many thousands of his subjects. Only ten days had\r\npassed since the counter-revolution had restored to him much of his\r\nformer despotic power, but the action of the Young Turks was quick and\r\ndecisive, and this was to be the last day of his long and calamitous\r\nreign.\r\n\r\nShevket Pasha, having completed his dispositions, lost no time in\r\nfurther parleying, recognising that to do as speedily as possible what\r\nhad to be done would probably save much bloodshed in the capital, and\r\nprevent the further spreading of the dangerous reactionary movements\r\nin Asia Minor and Albania. At three in the morning of April 24 the\r\nMacedonian troops, regulars and volunteers, began to work their way\r\ninto the city from all sides, and proceeded to occupy Stamboul,\r\nGalata, and Pera. They entered Stamboul by the principal gates that\r\npierce the ancient walls, encountering resistance at one gate only.\r\nNear the Sublime Porte a portion of the garrison offered a determined\r\nresistance, which was overcome by Niazi Bey, at the head of the\r\nResna battalion, and a band of Macedonian volunteers. Some of the\r\nguard-houses had to be taken at the point of the bayonet. The entry\r\ninto Stamboul of the Parliamentary troops seems to have taken a great\r\npart of the garrison by surprise, for Shevket Pasha, in his official\r\nreport, states that “the troops quartered at the Ministry of War were\r\ncompelled to surrender before they had time to defend themselves.”\r\n\r\nOn the farther side of the Golden Horn the fighting was more severe\r\nthan in Stamboul. Shortly after 5 A.M. firing commenced in the\r\noutskirts of Pera. The Macedonian troops attacked the Taksim and\r\nTashkishla barracks, which were defended in most stubborn manner\r\nby desperate men who thought that they would receive no mercy, and\r\nthere was fierce street fighting in the European quarter, where the\r\nguard-houses were bravely held by the misguided men of the First Army\r\nCorps. From the Tashkishla barracks a heavy fire was opened upon\r\nthe advancing troops, and the barracks had to be shelled and almost\r\ndestroyed by the artillery on the heights above, before the garrison,\r\nafter several hours’ fighting and heavy losses, surrendered.\r\n\r\nEqually desperate was the defence of the Taxim barracks, the attack on\r\nwhich was led by Enver Bey. This young officer, who, during the months\r\nthat preceded the revolution, had wandered, disguised and at great risk\r\nto his life, through the Macedonian garrison towns, and there, though\r\nsurrounded by spies, had successfully won officers and men over to the\r\ncause, like his friend Niazi desired no recognition of his patriotic\r\nwork, and, modest as he is able, was glad to accept the simple post of\r\nmilitary _attaché_ at Berlin. Recalled by his country’s danger when\r\nthe counter-revolution broke out, he joined the army at Salonica, and\r\nnow, on April 24, he was leading across the Taxim Square a charge of\r\nregular troops and volunteers—Moslems, Christians, and Jews—fighting\r\nshoulder to shoulder against a Moslem foe, a strange thing, indeed, to\r\ncome about in Turkey. These men fought splendidly under their young\r\nleader, but so deadly a fire was opened upon them from the loopholed\r\nbarracks that here, too, artillery had to be employed to overpower the\r\ndefence. Guns were dragged up the steep, narrow streets by the willing\r\npopulace and opened fire at very short range upon the barracks and the\r\nTaxim guard-house. Then there was a rush of the Turks, Bulgarians,\r\nand white-capped Albanians, and the defenders, after a three hours’\r\nresistance, which cost the attacking force many casualties, hoisted the\r\nwhite flag and surrendered.\r\n\r\nWhile barracks were being thus assaulted, and there was hand-to-hand\r\nfighting in the streets of Pera, the commander-in-chief of the\r\nMacedonian forces had made most careful dispositions to preserve order\r\nin the great city and protect the civilian population. A detachment\r\nof troops was sent to guard each embassy. Bodies of regulars, cadets\r\nand volunteers patrolled the streets of Pera and Galata, shooting down\r\nsuch Marines and Kurds as were attempting to loot the shops, and making\r\nprisoners of all the soldiers belonging to the garrison whom they came\r\nacross. In Stamboul the troops seized hundreds of spies, _softas_ and\r\n_hodjas_, who, after stirring up the evil passions of the garrison and\r\nthe populace, had taken refuge in the mosques. By noon, quiet had been\r\nrestored in Constantinople, and in the evening the troops quartered\r\nin the Selimieh barracks at Scutari surrendered to the Macedonian\r\nregiments which had been transported across the Bosphorus to compel the\r\nsubmission of these men, and to intercept fugitives from the capital.\r\n\r\nThese operations were all planned and carried into execution with a\r\nwonderful skill. The discipline, courage, and irreproachable conduct of\r\nthe Macedonian troops aroused the admiration of all foreign observers.\r\nThe wild-looking volunteers from the mountains fought as bravely as the\r\nregulars, and their behaviour was exemplary. That evening nearly twenty\r\nthousand fighting men, flushed with victory, were scattered through the\r\ngreat city, and yet there appear to have been no cases of drunkenness\r\nor irregularities of any description. It was the triumph of the right\r\ncause—the cause that represents enlightenment, justice, liberty, and\r\ntrue patriotism—as opposed to tyranny, corruption, fanaticism, and\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nThe capital was in the hands of the Young Turks; the forces of reaction\r\nhad been crushed; a state of siege was proclaimed; some thousands of\r\narrests were made; the more guilty received the punishment which they\r\ndeserved, and the others were treated with leniency, for, while justice\r\nwas administered, anything that savoured of vengeance was disallowed;\r\nthe First Army Corps was disbanded and the mutinous soldiers were sent\r\nto Macedonia, to be employed in constructing roads; Tewfik Pasha and\r\nhis ministers consented to carry on the government provisionally.\r\n\r\nIn short, the Young Turk _régime_ was firmly reestablished by men\r\nwho acted with discretion and decision after a crisis that perhaps\r\nhas cleared the atmosphere and effected a reconciliation between\r\nsuch political foes as have in common the love of country and the\r\ndetermination to uphold the Constitution.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of April 27 Reshad Effendi left his residence,\r\nthe Dolma Baghche Palace, and drove to the War Office, where he was\r\nproclaimed Sultan with a salvo of 101 guns. After thirty-three years of\r\nluxurious but depressing isolation he now changes places with his elder\r\nbrother, the former going from captivity to a throne, the latter from\r\na throne to captivity. The new Sultan is an amiable man, beloved by\r\nhis _entourage_, and he has already produced a favourable impression on\r\nsuch foreigners as have been received by him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aali Pasha, 26.\r\n\r\n  Aassim Bey, 248.\r\n\r\n  Abd-ul-Aziz, accession of, 25;\r\n    deposed, 29.\r\n\r\n  Abdul Hamid, accession of, 30.\r\n\r\n  Abdul
